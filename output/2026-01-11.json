    "fullText": "And just like that, the Green Bay Packers’ 2025 season is over. After a hot start to the year with big wins over the Detroit Lions and Washington Commanders, the team found themselves on a downward trajectory after major injuries to their most important playmakers. A 4-game losing streak turned into a 5-game losing streak after the Packers fell 31-27 against the Chicago Bears in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Simply put: it’s a devastating way to end the season, but we can all rest now. Let’s dive into the winners and losers from the Packers’ final game of the season.\n\nMy boy, my baby boy. We’ve been waiting all season for Matthew Golden’s coveted first NFL touchdown, and Saturday night, he finally got his moment. After a year full of limited opportunities in the receiving game, Golden was one of Jordan Love’s go-to players against the Bears on an offense that just couldn’t get the run game going. He was running routes really well, and used his speed to extend plays. He also had his “wow” moment, a 23-yard touchdown catch on a play which could’ve ended 10 yards sooner. The effort on this play was stunning—I didn’t think Golden had this in him. He finished the night catching 4 of 5 targets for 84 yards and a score. The rookie looked phenomenal in the game that mattered most, and I can’t wait to see what year 2 looks like.\n\nWHAT A TIME FOR MATTHEW GOLDEN'S FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON\n\nGBvsCHI on Prime Video\nAlso streaming on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/s0j2j3XGKC\n\nSimply put: I’m not sure what else Jordan Love could’ve done for the Packers last night. He’s finally entered “if he’s your quarterback, your team has a chance” territory, but the problem is…the team. The offensive line did Love no favors, and it didn’t help that Sean Rhyan and Jacob Monk, their #2 and #3 options at center, both went down during the game. The run game did absolutely nothing, with Josh Jacobs averaging a paltry 2.9 yards per carry. There were egregious drops from the receivers, which has been the story of the last two years.\n\nDespite all of this, Love was still able to throw for 323 yards and 4 TDs with 24 completions on 46 attempts. He spread the love (I’m sorry) last night, throwing to 9 different pass catchers, and all 4 of his TD passes were to different receivers. He’s finally a calm and composed veteran under center, but the rest of the team needs some serious work for this offense to stop the late-game slides.\n\nBird doing Bird things\n\n📺: Prime Video pic.twitter.com/vGmHUS3YDJ\n\n— Green Bay Packers (@packers) January 11, 2026\n\nBrandon McManus left 7 points on the field after two missed FG attempts and a missed XP attempt. The Packers lost by 4. If I’m doing the math correctly, this guy needs to not be a Packer anymore.\n\nThe field goal is no good 👀\n\nBears take over still down 3\n\nGBvsCHI on Prime Video\nAlso streaming on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/ouDcHxnkgp\n\nI disagree with the sentiment that Matt LaFleur has been on the hot seat all season, but I do think his seat warmed up after an inexcusable collapse to the Bears in the playoffs. After being up 18 points, it was the Packers’ game to lose, and they did just that. They lost. For whatever reason, LaFleur seems set on running the ball in early, long yardage situations. If it works, fine! But it doesn’t work. I counted 6 third-and-longs last night as a direct result of running the ball for a gain of 1 or 2 beforehand. The team was only able to run for a total of 99 yards last night, and it was clear early in the game that it wasn’t working.\n\nThe team scored once in the second half—a concerning trend throughout the year. We saw collapses against the Browns. The Cowboys. The Broncos. The Bears once, and now the Bears twice. Again—I don’t think I agree with firing LaFleur, because I’m not sure who would be an adequate replacement. However, something has to change. Is it the offensive coordinator? Is it play calling duties? I’m not sure, but this game was one of the worst of LaFleur’s 7 year tenure.\n\nFIRE JEFF HAFLEY. Just kidding, but also…what? The defense did a really great job in the first half of the game, limiting the Bears to just 3 points in their first drive, and ending their next three drives in turnovers. They were even okay in the third quarter—just three more points from the Bears, and another Caleb Williams interception. If you want to stop reading here, I don’t blame you.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of the game, the Packers allowed 25 points. The Bears scored during every drive of the game’s final quarter, and they did it rather quickly—their longest drive of the quarter was just 2:30. Offenses collapse sometimes. I get it. Defenses collapse sometimes. I get it. When both collapse at the same time, you cannot win football games.\n\nWith the season officially over for the Packers, we are all finally out of our misery, for the time being. When the 2026 season begins in September, we should have both Tucker Kraft and Micah Parsons back from their torn ACLs—two players whose presence could’ve saved last night’s game. The roster and coaching staff will no doubt look a little different, with the possible departure of guys like Romeo Doubs, Elgton Jenkins, Rashan Gary, and Jeff Hafley, among others. Will the team be able to do what it takes to keep their Super Bowl window open? We’ll find out a year from now. Stay tuned.",

    "fullText": "West Ham United’s January search for survival has taken a familiar turn towards north London. According to the Daily Mail, the Hammers have now “made contact with Tottenham Hotspur about a January move to sign goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky”, a development that reflects both urgency and uncertainty at the London Stadium.\n\nThis has been a bruising campaign. West Ham sit seven points adrift of safety, already having parted company with Graham Potter, while Nuno Espirito Santo now finds himself under mounting pressure. The Daily Mail report makes clear that the Portuguese coach views the winter window as a final lifeline, with a goalkeeper identified as a priority.\n\nEspirito Santo, himself a former FC Porto stopper, understands the psychological weight of that position. When confidence drains from the back, results often follow.\n\nWest Ham have already acted to address their lack of goals, completing deals for Pablo and Taty Castellanos. Attention has now shifted to damage limitation. Too many goals conceded, too many leads squandered, and too many afternoons defined by defensive uncertainty.\n\nThe Daily Mail state that “West Ham have now made contact with London rivals Tottenham over a potential move to sign Czech Republic international Kinsky this month.” The 22 year old arrived at Spurs in January 2025 under Ange Postecoglou, initially deputising during Guglielmo Vicario’s injury absence.\n\nThat early exposure brought promise, but opportunity soon vanished.\n\nOnce Vicario returned to fitness, the hierarchy reasserted itself. Under Thomas Frank, Kinsky has made just two appearances this season, both in the Carabao Cup, and “keeping two clean sheets in the process.” For a young goalkeeper, that is both a reminder of his quality and a frustration at his limited pathway.\n\nTottenham’s position is pragmatic. Vicario remains first choice, and squad balance matters. A loan or permanent move could suit all parties, particularly if minutes are guaranteed elsewhere.\n\nWest Ham’s recent missteps have been highlighted. The club spent around £20m on Mads Hermansen last summer, only for the Dane to concede “14 goals in his first four appearances” before losing his place to Alphonse Areola. Now, “Nuno has made it clear to him that he has no future at the club”, leaving West Ham scrambling once more.\n\nAreola has not disgraced himself, yet results continue to slide. As the report notes, “While Areola hasn’t particularly done anything wrong this season, he can’t stop conceding goals.” In a relegation battle, perception becomes reality.\n\nKinsky is described as “phenomenal”, and while that label carries optimism rather than proof, desperation sharpens decision making. The defence has been fragile, but goalkeepers often become the final line of belief.\n\nTottenham may be open to a deal given Kinsky’s lack of involvement, and the player himself would likely welcome a chance to play regularly. With weeks remaining in the window, this feels like a situation driven by necessity rather than luxury.\n\nFor West Ham supporters, this report rings with uncomfortable familiarity. Another January, another scramble, another attempt to fix deep structural problems with short term solutions. Yet the interest in Kinsky makes sense. Fans understand that survival sometimes requires calculated risk.\n\nKinsky’s appeal lies in freshness. He arrives without baggage from this season’s struggles and with something to prove. Supporters may see him as a psychological reset as much as a tactical one. When confidence drains from the stands, a new face can change the mood.\n\nTottenham fans, meanwhile, are likely indifferent but pragmatic. Kinsky is well regarded, but Vicario is established. Allowing a talented backup to gain minutes elsewhere could be sensible squad management, provided Spurs retain long term control.\n\nBoth fanbases will recognise the gamble. For West Ham, it is about hope and momentum. For Tottenham, it is about asset value and development. In a relegation fight, those motivations can align briefly, even between rivals.",

    "fullText": "Matthew Stafford injury update: Latest news on Rams QB getting tests on finger after wild-card win over Panthers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile there was collective relief among Rams fans that Los Angeles avoided a first-round loss to the Carolina Panthers, there is something else for them to worry about.\n\nMatthew Stafford was sacked only once, but he was pressured nine times and took a few punishing blows. He left the game with an injury, and the Rams faithful should monitor it ahead of their divisional matchup.\n\nThe Sporting News has everything you need to know about Stafford's injury update following their wild-card win.\n\nMORE: Three problems Rams must fix in NFC playoffs\n\nFollowing his injury, Stafford received X-rays on his throwing hand.\n\nThe good news for the Rams and their fan base is that Stafford's X-rays on his hand came back negative. This was confirmed by Ian Rapoport on Sunday morning. There was no dislocation, and it was simply a bad case of getting his hand bent back.\n\nEven if there was a dislocation or fracture, with how tough Stafford is, he probably would have played through it.\n\nAfter being pressured nine times in their win over the Panthers, Stafford certainly woke up sore the next day. On one of those hits in particular, his throwing hand collided with a defender, which immediately looked to bother the veteran quarterback.\n\nInjured again: #Rams QB Matthew Stafford take another big hit on that hand.\n\nThis is getting worse. He was down for a minute pic.twitter.com/3lWdCHndNG\n\n— FirstDownMedia (@FirstDownMediaa) January 10, 2026\n\n%3Cscript%20async%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.twitter.com%2Fwidgets.js%22%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E\n\nStafford is one of the toughest players ever to play the quarterback position, but this hand injury caused real in-game problems. Following this hit, Stafford completed only two of his next 10 passing attempts.\n\nThis did seem to spark a Panthers comeback, but luckily for the Rams, they have an MVP candidate and future Hall of Famer under center.\n\nMORE: Why Matthew Stafford's performance dipped after hurting hand\n\nWhile there is no concrete reporting on whether Stafford will play or not next week, there's a pretty large sample size to look at.\n\nStafford is one of the toughest quarterbacks in NFL history. There is evidence dating back to his days with the Detroit Lions, when he threw a game-winning touchdown pass despite a dislocated shoulder.\n\nGolden Tate, who is a former teammate of Stafford, shared a story following his hand injury on Saturday.\n\nOne time Stafford messed up a finger on his throwing hand. I checked on him like “you good?”\nHe said, “bro I’m straight… I got nine other fingers.”\nHe’s different!\n\n— Golden Tate (@ShowtimeTate) January 11, 2026\n\nWhile there is not going to be anything set in stone this soon after the injury, it's fair to assume that Stafford is not going to miss a playoff game due to a non-serious hand injury.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool’s recruitment work remains firmly ongoing, despite last summer delivering a Premier League title and a significant refresh of the squad. Credit must go to TEAMtalk for the original report, which sheds light on a familiar name continuing to feature prominently in the club’s forward planning.\n\nUnder Arne Slot, Liverpool have taken a measured and data led approach to squad building, but there is a clear sense that further evolution is required. While the collapse of a late move for Marc Guehi left some frustration, attention has now turned towards attacking depth, particularly on the left side of the frontline.\n\nInjuries have played their part in shaping January discussions, with Alexander Isak’s leg break limiting options across the front line. However, the lack of a natural replacement following Luis Diaz’s departure last summer has been evident for some time.\n\nCody Gakpo has shouldered much of the responsibility, with Rio Ngumoha also used in flashes, but Liverpool’s recruitment team are clearly exploring alternatives with greater consistency and upside. The left wing is viewed as an area where elite competition could raise the overall attacking level.\n\nAccording to TEAMtalk, Liverpool remain in regular contact with Paris Saint-Germain forward Bradley Barcola, a player who has been tracked for a considerable period. His situation in Paris remains uncertain, with negotiations over a new contract ongoing but no guarantees over his long term role.\n\nThe report states that PSG have ruled out a January exit, though the summer window could tell a different story. Valued at €69.6m (£60m) and under contract until 2028, Barcola is attracting interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City, underlining his standing across Europe.\n\nBarcola’s recent involvement at PSG has been limited, having “started on the bench for five of PSG’s last six league games, being an unused substitute twice.” That context matters. Liverpool will be monitoring whether this pattern continues under Luis Enrique.\n\nSlot can offer something compelling, a defined role, tactical clarity and the promise of regular minutes in a title challenging side. Richard Hughes and his recruitment staff are unlikely to force matters in January, but groundwork is clearly being laid should circumstances shift.\n\nFrom a Liverpool supporter’s perspective, this report feels quietly encouraging rather than headline grabbing. The key detail is not an imminent bid, but the fact that regular contact is being maintained. That suggests intent and patience, two traits that have defined Liverpool’s smartest recruitment cycles in recent years.\n\nBradley Barcola fits the profile many fans hoped for after Luis Diaz left. Young, technically strong, comfortable on the left and capable of stretching defences. Watching Gakpo adapt admirably has been positive, but there is room for another elite option who naturally thrives in wide areas.\n\nArne Slot’s system relies heavily on wide attackers who can receive between the lines and carry threat in isolation. Barcola looks well suited to that role, especially if offered trust and continuity. The idea that Liverpool could present him with a guaranteed place in the XI feels realistic rather than speculative.\n\nSupporters also appreciate the calm approach. There is no sense of panic buying, even with injuries disrupting plans. Instead, Liverpool appear content to wait for the right moment, trusting that situations like Barcola’s can evolve quickly.\n\nIf this one reaches the summer, optimism will grow. Liverpool staying close, informed and ready to move is often how the most successful deals begin.",

    "fullText": "After Bears coach Ben Johnson delivered a four-letter message to the Packers in the locker room after Saturday night's win over Green Bay, Johnson took to the podium to explain that his team perceived disrespect in advance of the third ever playoff meeting between the hundred-year rivals.\n\n“There was probably a little bit more noise coming out of their building up north to start the week, which we heard loud and clear, players and coaches alike,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson didn't specify the noise. And if there was any, it wasn't loud enough to rise above the noise of a noisy week of NFL news.\n\nAs noted by ESPN.com, Packers receiver Christian Watson and cornerback Keisean Nixon said they wanted to face Chicago in the playoffs. Also, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley told reporters during his midweek press conference, \"We are not going to be done, so I will see you guys next week.\"\n\nWhatever it was, Johnson and the Bears saw it, and they milked it.\n\n\"It definitely got us riled up,\" Bears safety Kevin Byard III said. \"It got us amped up for the game.\"\n\nThe point is this. They can act like they don't listen. But they do. They all do. And for any players or coaches who may create some noise, it's the NFL's version of the Miranda warnings.\n\nAnything you say can and will be used against you.",

    "description": "When push came to shove, the Packers couldn't finish -- providing a fitting end to the 2025 season.",
    "fullText": "At almost every turn of the 2025 season, the Green Bay Packers failed to finish -- making Saturday night's collapse at Soldier Field in the NFC Wild Card Round a fitting conclusion to a season marked by missed opportunities and gut-wrenching losses torn from the jaws of victory.\n\nEvery NFL season has ebbs and flows. The Packers' dips were punctuated over and over again by collapse, and once injuries turned the once-promising season into a tailspin, the only logical conclusion was one final calamity, and Saturday night at Soldier Field did not disappoint.\n\nIt was a conglomeration of all the season's collapses, packaged nicely into one unforgettable defeat at the hands of the franchise's oldest rival.\n\nIt didn't take long for the 2025 Packers to show their untrustworthy side.\n\nAfter looking like one of the NFL's top teams during the first two weeks, the Packers squandered a 10-0 lead in Cleveland, had a go-ahead field goal blocked and lost to the lowly Browns on a field goal as time expired.\n\nA week later, the Packers led 13-0 early in Dallas and held two different leads in the fourth quarter but ended up incredibly fortunate to escape AT&T Stadium with what ended up being an incredibly important 40-40 tie.\n\nAfter vanquishing Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers in primetime to get to get to 5-1-1, the Packers returned home and slopped through a 16-13 loss to the Panthers that saw Carolina win with a field goal as time expired after the Packers tied the game in the fourth quarter.\n\nThen, after getting to 9-3-1 with a season-correcting four-game win streak, came one of the most torturous five-week stretches of recent Packers football. The tormenting began with an injury-ravaged collapse in Denver that saw the Packers lose Zach Tom (who didn't play again in 2025) and Micah Parsons (who tore his ACL) and lose the game after holding a 23-14 lead in the third quarter over the AFC's No. 1 seed. The Broncos went on a 20-3 run to win it. In many ways, the 2025 season died for the Packers on Sunday, Dec. 14 at Mile High. The corpse of Matt LaFleur's team never won again.\n\nA week after the Denver debacle, the Packers botched an onside kick and gave up a fourth down touchdown pass, blowing a 10-point fourth quarter lead before losing on a game-ending touchdown pass in overtime in the first of two epic Soldier Field collapses.\n\nThe Packers became just the fourth playoff team in NFL history to lose four straight games to end the regular season. This was a ghost ship floating aimlessly into the postseason, but a chance at redemption arrived in the form of a rubber match with the Bears -- providing arguably the best possible matchup for a team that no longer belonged in the heavyweight class.\n\nYet the final kill shot arrived without mercy on Saturday night, when the Packers led 21-3 at halftime and 27-16 in the fourth quarter before losing 31-27 during one of the franchise's worst playoff collapses. A dominant first 30 minutes were no match for the pure chaos and buffoonery of the final 30.\n\nThe Packers played 18 games during the 2025 season and won nine, or exactly half of the games. In five of the failures, the Packers led by nine or more points.\n\nIn an astonishing season that still makes no sense, the Packers lost three games in which they never punted and didn't win in five games they lead by two scores.\n\nSaturday's collapse will be studied for weeks, months. It was a truly incredible blend of stale offense, defeats at the line of scrimmage, kicking catastrophes, defensive rupturing and inexcusable coaching mistakes over a 30-minute span.\n\nThe stunning loss would have been inconceivable had it not been so well rehearsed. The 2025 Packers had been building to this moment all season. And now it is over, another season -- the 15th since winning a Super Bowl -- gone like a fart in the wind.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Packers' collapse in Chicago provides fitting end to 2025 season",

    "fullText": "Ahead of its AMC debut, TNA Wrestling re-signed a number of in-ring talents, including Mustafa Ali and TNA World Tag Team Champions The Hardy Boys. As seen in recent weeks, however, the company wasn't successful in all cases.\n\nAccording to Fightful Select, Killer Kelly is another name that has departed from TNA Wrestling following the expiration of her latest contract. Last month, reports indicated that Kelly and TNA officials were in the midst of discussions regarding a possible extension. Evidently, that result didn't pan out as the outlet notes that Kelly has now \"effectively left the company\" with no creative plans currently in place for her.\n\nOriginally, Kelly's TNA deal was said to end in August 2025. Due to an absence stemming from maternity leave, though, an additional four months were tacked onto it.\n\nKelly, a former Knockouts Tag Team Champion, returned to TNA programming in June 2025, setting her sights on then-Knockouts Champion Masha Slamovich. Kelly went on to unsuccessfully challenge Slamovich in a chain match for the title on \"TNA iMPACT.\" Her last TNA in-ring appearance, taped on December 7, saw her take a loss to Myla Grace on \"TNA Xplosion.\"\n\nAs of this writing, Kelly's potential next moves in wrestling are unknown. Meanwhile, Jake Something wasted little time to secure a new home for himself following the expiration of his respective TNA contract on January 1. Something, now known as Jake Doyle, was announced as the newest member of All Elite Wrestling roster after his introduction from Don Callis on last Wednesday's edition of \"AEW Dynamite.\"\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns may have only won five games in 2025, but they may not be far off, and their future is bright.\n\nAs the NFL wildcard weekend continues, ESPN showed a graphic on the youngest wide receivers in the NFL, and the Browns led the league in one key statistic. What was that statistic?\n\nThey led the NFL in snaps played by a rookie, and they led it by a landslide. According to ESPN, the Browns had 5,971 snaps played by a rookie in 2025. This was the most by over 600 snaps played. The New York Jets were second on the list with 5,327 snaps played by a rookie this past season.\n\nThis makes sense when considering that rookie quarterbacks started most of the season for the Browns, a rookie led them in rushing and receiving, their starting middle linebacker was a rookie, as was one of their starting defensive tackles. The rookies played well this season, and that bodes well for the future of the franchise.\n\n— Mike Kadlick (@mikekadlick) January 11, 2026\n\nJust look at the Patriots. They are in their second season after landing a quarterback in the 2024 NFL Draft. They did not even start him right away and gave him an on-ramp to the field as a rookie. Now, they are AFC East champs and are in contention for a Super Bowl after winning 14 games.\n\nOf course, the key difference between the Browns and the Patriots right now is that the Browns are still hunting for their quarterback of the future. Well, and a head coach.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns led NFL in one crazy stat that bodes well for their future",

    "fullText": "The LA Chargers and New England Patriots matchup is among the more even contests of Wild Card weekend. Both teams have been impressive at times and are led by their quarterbacks, Drake Maye and Justin Herbert. The position could be the biggest differentiating factor when it’s all said and done.\n\nAfter all, Maye is up for the MVP award. Herbert, on the other hand, isn’t up for any awards… except for his second-career Pro Bowl. But he logged another solid season with the Bolts, ranking in the top 10 in passing yards, passing TDs, and completions.\n\nNo offense to Herbert, but Maye will be the focal point on Sunday. He’s been stellar all season and is evolving into the next face of the NFL. That’s why, when Chargers defender Khalil Mack was asked about the Patriots QB, he gave the man his flowers.\n\n“He’s special, man. He has the arm talent, looks pretty fast as well. So, it’s going to be a challenge for us to keep him in the pocket,” Mack told the media via the LA Chargers YouTube.\n\nBut he didn’t stop there. The former Defensive Player of the Year went on to describe the multiple ways Maye can hurt them, and what they need to do to stop it.\n\n“Rushing coverage is going to have to work well. Just understanding we gotta rush four as one up front. Keep him contained in the pocket. Not letting him get out whenever he doesn’t see anybody open,” Mack listed before continuing,\n\n“On the back end, we’re going to have to cover as well, because he’s accurate and able to get the ball in all different types of spots.”\n\nMaye led the NFL this season by completing 72% of his passes. It’s an otherworldly number, with the next closest contender more than two percentage points behind. He’s also thrown only eight INTs and fumbled the ball twice, making him a savant when it comes to taking care of the football.\n\nDespite Maye’s effectiveness, Mack later shared that his defensive coordinator’s message to the defense ahead of the game hadn’t changed.\n\n“Same as it’s always been. Understanding who we want to be, the defense we want to be, and putting it on film. Honestly, not talking about it too much. But just knowing what we want to be, and we understand what we want to be,” Mack shared.\n\nThe Chargers’ defense has been playing better as of late. In fact, they haven’t allowed an opposing team to score more than 21 points since Week 11. They simply need to stick to what’s been working over the past few months, and they could find themselves in a battle in the fourth quarter.\n\nAll in all, we know that Maye and Herbert are the main talking points in this matchup. However, this could be a sneaky, defensive battle. It’s Maye’s first career playoff game, and the Chargers’ defense is hot. Meanwhile, Herbert also tends to struggle in playoff games, and the Patriots’ defense could play a major role as well.\n\nThe sportsbooks are favoring Maye and the Pats right now by 3.5 points, and we aren’t going to disagree. Riding a three-game winning streak and carrying momentum all season long, New England should win this contest. We’ll predict they take it 17-12 in a grinder of a game where the Chargers struggle to score touchdowns. It would be the Patriots’ first playoff win since the 2018 season.\n\nThe post Patriots vs. Chargers: LB Khalil Mack Reveals LA’s Strategy to Stop Drake Maye Ahead of the Wildcard Clash appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Why Red Sox missing out on Alex Bregman might be blessing in disguise originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox were dealt some brutal news on Saturday night, as the Chicago Cubs swooped in and stole free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman.\n\nHe signed a five-year, $175 million deal with the Cubs, ditching the Red Sox for the Cubs. Boston will need to pivot to some other options this winter, and while there are a couple of decent choices, seeing Bregman leave is still a difficult situation to come to terms with.\n\nLosing Bregman to the Cubs is a brutal situation for the Red Sox, but for Keith Law of The Athletic, it might actually not be the worst outcome. Law's opinion points to Bregman signing with the Cubs actually being a blessing in disguise for the Red Sox.\n\n\"The obvious answer for Boston would be to sign Bo Bichette... I'd rather have Bichette than Bregman anyway,\" Law writes, \"and he's at least capable of backing up Trevor Story at short.\"\n\nAfter losing Bregman to the Cubs, the Red Sox need to find an alternative to their infield hole. Fortunately, due to Marcelo Mayer being able to move to either second or third base, the Red Sox have some flexibility.\n\nAnd for Law, signing Bichette, who's younger, and coming off a strong 2025 season with the Toronto Blue Jays, would be the better option anyway.\n\nThe Red Sox have some options to replace Bregman, and Bichette would be a clear answer for Boston this winter.\n\nMore: Red Sox get brutal decision from Alex Bregman amid $175 million Cubs deal\n\nBregman's $175 million deal is far from cheap, even when factoring in the $70 million in deferrals the Cubs put into the contract.\n\nBoston will likely pivot to new options for their infield addition this winter, and while losing Bregman stings, it might not be all that bad.\n\nLaw would prefer Bichette to Bregman anyway, and with the age difference (Bregman is 32 and Bichette is 28), it's not a far-fetched belief from Law.\n\nThe Red Sox might've received a blessing in disguise, seeing Bregman sign with the Cubs. Now, they can go after Bichette, who's a younger and arguably better fit for the Red Sox than Bregman would've been.\n\nThey still need to sign Bichette or another top infield option this winter. But if they can bring Bichette to Boston, then losing Bregman wouldn't be the horrible free-agent outcome it seems like.\n\nRafael Devers trade by Red Sox takes weird twist with Alex Bregman news\n\nPhillies get bad news on Bo Bichette amid unexpected challenge from Alex Bregman Cubs deal\n\nCubs' Alex Bregman contract details involve $175 million, five years\n\nMets' 23-year old rising star hits 4 home runs in 1 game in Venezuelan Winter League\n\nBlue Jays' Bo Bichette free agency impacted by Alex Bregman signing with Cubs\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency",

    "title": "Sean McAdam: By losing Alex Bregman, Red Sox squander the trust they had earned back with fan base",
    "description": "The Red Sox lost more than a free agent Saturday night. They also lost credibility.",
    "fullText": "In failing to outbid the Chicago Cubs and retain Alex Bregman, the Red Sox have succeeded in painting themselves into a corner.\n\nThere’s but one option remaining on the free agent market — Bo Bichette — and he’s going to require more money and a longer deal than Bregman just landed.\n\nIf you’re at all optimistic about the Red Sox winning that bidding war, congratulations — you possess belief in the franchise that few can still muster.\n\nIn the end, the contract the Cubs gave Bregman wasn’t outlandish. It included deferrals that will lower the present-day value, as well as the AAV (average annual value), a key component when it comes to monitoring the CBT.\n\nA year ago, the Red Sox got into a staredown with Bregman and his representatives and won. When Bregman finally agreed to a three-year, $120 million pact last February, camps had opened and time was running short.\n\nThe fit appeared perfect, too. Here was a winning player with known leadership abilities, a stout defender who offered righthanded balance to an increasingly lefty lineup.\n\nThe deal had something for both sides: Bregman landed a $40 million AAV, albeit one that was reduced some by deferrals, while giving him the added attraction of some opt-outs.\n\nThe Red Sox, meanwhile, got something far more for their money. When Bregman signed, the Red Sox regained some long-lost credibility with their fan base. The contract signaled that they were again serious about winning, and when that was followed two months later by a six-year contract extension for Garrett Crochet, fans were convinced that the era of austerity at Fenway was mercifully over.\n\nThe arrival of Bregman and Crochet, coupled with the influx of young talent, signaled that it was OK to trust the organization again. A return to the postseason, however brief, validated the whole approach.\n\nAnd now? Now, the Red Sox are right back to where they were a year ago, their trust strained if not entirely spent, with few pathways back.\n\nIt’s impossible to feel sorry for them. The Sox were casual at best in their pursuit of alternatives earlier this offseason. They barely stirred when it came to Kyle Schwarber, and while many presumed he was always going to return to Philadelphia, the Red Sox, with their resources, could have given him something to think about. They did not.\n\nThey made an offer on Pete Alonso, but reportedly never went beyond a three-year proposal, a laughably underwhelming approach for a 30-year-old free agent in his prime with multiple teams interested.\n\nIf their laissez faire approach to other free agent sluggers signaled a confidence that Bregman would ultimately return to them, they learned otherwise, the hard way, late Saturday night.\n\nAnd it’s not like there are several alternatives for them a month out from the start of spring training. Ketel Marte is officially off the trade market and Bichette has a number of different suitors, including the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nOne could argue that the Phillies have chronically underachieved on the field in recent seasons, failing to get out of the Division Series in each of the last two seasons despite consecutive first-place finishes. Over the last four years, they’ve gone from losing in the World Series to losing in the NLCS to twice losing in the Division Series.\n\nBut when they want or need a player, they usually get him. They made Schwarber a priority and re-signed him. And with new bench coach Don Mattingly, a known mentor to Bichette, they’re now considered the favorites to emerge as winners of these negotiations, too.\n\nIf they miss out on Bichette, the Sox will be forced to make do from within. They could install Marcelo Mayer at third and form a platoon of Romy Gonzalez and David Hamilton for second base, but both solutions are, to put it mildly, imperfect. Mayer, talented as he may be, hasn’t established himself and must prove he can stay on the field for an entire season. Gonzalez and Hamilton profile as role players now being asked to punch way above their weight.\n\nThat doesn’t begin to address the lack of pop, or the yawning leadership void that Bregman’s departure has created.\n\nAt the outset of the offseason, the Red Sox publicly acknowledged they needed additional power to not only compete in the division but to advance deeper in October. They acquired Willson Contreras, but his production merely matches what they got out of Bregman a year ago. Offensively speaking, the Sox are back to ground zero.\n\nThe Red Sox’ unwillingness to get uncomfortable in pursuit of another championship has relegated them to a sort of baseball middle ground — interesting and maybe even competitive, yes, but unable to take the extra step that would vault them to the next level.\n\nWorse, they’ve squandered the good will that they assiduously rebuilt a year ago, when for a brief moment in time, they convinced the fan base that they cared again.\n\nAnd, as usual, they have no one to blame but themselves.\n\nWhat Alex Bregman leaving Boston Red Sox could mean for Marcelo Mayer\n\nSome Things I Think I Think: Kristian Campbell needs a fresh start. Here’s hoping he gets one\n\nAlex Bregman leaves Red Sox after one year, signs $175M deal with Cubs\n\nBoston Red Sox injury updates on Triston Casas, Roman Anthony, Marcelo Mayer\n\nRed Sox trade of outfielder (Jarren Duran?

    "fullText": "Packers' connection to John Harbaugh adds to Matt LaFleur firing rumors originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have a Matt LaFleur decision to make.\n\nDoes the head coach get fired after a playoff loss to the Chicago Bears on Saturday? That blown lead by Green Bay was certainly painful. And, most intriguingly, they've got a connection to John Harbaugh.\n\nNot many would've expected that Harbaugh would be available on the head coach market this offseason.\n\nBut then the Ravens went from Super Bowl favorites to missing the playoffs entirely, and Harbaugh was out of his job after 18 years at the helm in Baltimore.\n\nNow, he's the top candidate available. And if the Packers wanted to move on from LaFleur, they've got a strong link to Harbaugh.\n\nThis is what ESPN's Adam Schefter posted on X on Sunday:\n\n\"Former Packers President Bob Harlan is royalty in Green Bay. His son Bryan is an agent who represents John Harbaugh. John Harbaugh has deep midwestern roots and ties. If the Packers decide they want to change head coaches, Harbaugh would be the most logical replacement.\"\n\nMORE: How Josh Allen became eternal hope for the Bills as the playoffs begin\n\nThat certainly sounds incredibly compelling.\n\nHarbaugh has been linked to pretty much every opening, including the Dolphins, who didn't fire Mike McDaniel until Harbaugh became available.\n\nHe had made the decision reportedly last week not to do any of his interviews until this week ahead. That certainly pointed to a playoff team or two being in the mix for him.\n\nThe Packers would make a lot of sense, if they want to take the big swing to dismiss LaFleur and chase down Harbaugh.\n\nBears' Colston Loveland joins Gronk in NFL tight end history\n\nThe Joe Montana reason the Packers might fire Matt LaFleur\n\nRico Dowdle's free agency takes a twist with Panthers changes\n\nTravis Kelce uses New Heights to share a major retirement update\n\nRomeo Doubs' free agency looms large for Packers",

    "description": "Eagles fans should temper their expectations for an offseason change at offensive coordinator.",
    "fullText": "Who's ever been told that 'Whatever is understood doesn't need to be explained?' It doesn't take long to understand that it isn't always true in every situation. One could argue that it's understood that Nick Sirianni is currently safe in his role as Philadelphia Eagles head coach. Why are we then hearing discussions about how cool it would be for John Harbaugh to come back home and take over at some point during the offseason?\n\nIt seems that those who are back on the 'Fire Nick Sirianni' train need an explanation. Let's resolve any debate quickly here. Nick Sirianni won't be fired. John Harbaugh won't return as this team's head coach. Fortunately, those conversations haven't been entertained or introduced by people who have the power to make that type of move.\n\nIt seems unlikely that A.J. Brown will leave. While we're at it, we might as well address that conversation, too. That brings us to Kevin Patullo. Perhaps you've heard. He has also seen his approval rating plunge in some circles. He remains on trial in the court of public opinion.\n\nHey, we get it! You've been frustrated by the product this Eagles offense has displayed. That has been the case all season. No one is going to tell you that you're wrong for how you feel. This offense has too much talent to be as ineffective as it has been for long stretches of this season.\n\nSome view Saquon Barkley's decline as a concern. Others blame injuries along the offensive line. He's been hit in the backfield much more often this season than he was at any point last year.\n\nEveryone believes Kevin Patullo is part of the problem. As people have done with Nick Sirianni, they've publicly expressed their desire for a change at offensive coordinator.\n\nIt seems that there is one major stumbling block to that happening. Coach Sirianni is fiercely loyal to Coach Patullo. The former has been very complimentary of the latter's performance. NFL Network analyst Mike Garafolo recently spoke with Anthony Gargano, and he thinks a win vs. the San Francisco 49ers would be enough to add job security for Philadelphia's offensive coordinator ahead of the offseason.\n\n“Nick is loyal to Kevin” \n\nMike Garafolo thinks a win vs. the 49ers would be enough for Kevin Patullo to be safe. pic.twitter.com/mknSy48Q6T\n\n— Anthony Gargano (@AnthonyLGargano) January 9, 2026\n\nWith that, we cancel theories of possible Mike McDaniels additions. The Miami Dolphins parted ways with their head coach of the past four NFL seasons, and he immediately became one of the game's most sought-after offensive coordinators.\n\nThough he failed as a head coach, no one questions his acumen as one of the game's top offensive minds. It would be fun to see what he can do with all of the Eagles' talent, but Sirianni's relationship with Patullo dates back to their days with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nNaturally, we can assume conversations are being entertained behind closed doors that we aren't privy to. No one knows what Howie Roseman and Jeffrey Lurie are offering in terms of their opinions, but if most were willing to gamble, they'd probably say it's certainly possible that Kevin Patullo returns as the Eagles' OC, regardless of what transpires in Philadelphia during their playoff run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: A reality check for Eagles fans hoping for an OC shake-up",

    "fullText": "Will Campbell did more than block for Drake Maye during his rookie season.\n\nEven as the No. 4 pick, Campbell wasn’t immune to some playful hazing inside the New England Patriots’ building. Head coach Mike Vrabel tasked the left tackle with an off-field assignment, directing Campbell to address the team with a weekly weather report during Friday meetings.\n\nAs detailed by NBC Sports Boston’s Phil Perry, Campbell would inform his teammates of community and player events, the lunch menu and other news along with a weather forecast. The 22-year-old eventually took a liking to Vrabel’s job.\n\n“He volunteered me,” Campbell said. “I didn’t really have a choice, but I’ve enjoyed doing it.”\n\nCampbell had fun with the role, often turning his address into a comedy routine. Vice president of football operations and strategy John “Stretch” Streicher even wrote jokes for the rookie.\n\n“I mean, I was not looking forward to it at first,” Campbell confessed. “It wasn’t something that I got out of bed on Friday morning looking forward to. But now, as long as there’s some good stuff to read, I don’t mind it.”\n\nHis teammates also enjoyed Campbell’s Friday debriefing, but rookie guard Jared Wilson couldn’t think of any clean material to share with Perry.\n\n“You know, there’s not a lot that I can,” Wilson said after a long pause. “Being totally honest with you. But they’re good. They’re good.”\n\nCampbell’s gig embodies a looser, jovial culture under Vrabel. Tight end Austin Hooper said the coach has created a “work-hard environment” while also allowing room for levity.\n\n“If something funny happens, you can laugh,” Hooper said. “You can smile. It’s OK to have whatever your personality is as long as you’re handling your business and you’re on top of your details. You can be whoever you want to be as long as you’re a good teammate and doing your job.”\n\nBears Join Patriots With Historic Playoff Comeback Vs. Packers",

    "fullText": "Bokang Masunyane has shared his thoughts on reigning ONE Strawweight MMA world champion Joshua Pacio, praising both the Filipino’s character and his standing within the division.\n\nKnown for his speed and relentless pressure, Masunyane has built a reputation as one of the most exciting contenders in ONE Championship.\n\nBut before setting his sights on the title, the South African fighter made clear that his respect for Pacio runs deep — even as he plots his route toward the belt.\n\nMasunyane’s comments highlight the mutual admiration that exists among elite competitors, even when their goals inevitably collide inside the cage.\n\nSpeaking to ONE Championship, Masunyane said: “I like Pacio. He’s got a very good personality, he’s got a good heart, he’s a fan’s favorite in the division.”\n\nThe remark offered a glimpse into the sportsmanship often seen at the highest levels of MMA. While rivals in pursuit of the same prize, Masunyane’s tone reflected genuine appreciation for Pacio’s approach both inside and outside competition.\n\nPacio, who continues to defend his title with composure and skill, has long been viewed as one of the sport’s most respected champions. His balance of humility and confidence has made him a symbol of consistency for the Strawweight division.\n\nMasunyane’s praise reinforces how Pacio’s influence extends beyond his performances — shaping how upcoming contenders carry themselves in pursuit of the same success.\n\nStill, Masunyane made it clear that his admiration will not stop his ambition. “As a fighter, I’d like to fight as much as I can. Whoever wants to fight me on my way to the title.\n\n“They are standing in my way, and my goal is to get that title shot, so I’m going through everyone in this division,” he told ONE Championship.”\n\nThose words underline the determination driving Masunyane’s climb. Despite acknowledging Pacio’s qualities, his focus remains squarely on his own mission, earning the chance to face the champion in the near future.\n\nMasunyane’s steady rise has positioned him among the top contenders at Strawweight. If his performances continue to impress, the path he’s describing may soon lead directly to Pacio himself.\n\nFor now, respect defines their relationship. But in ONE Championship, respect and rivalry often walk the same line, and Masunyane seems ready to cross it when the opportunity comes.",

    "title": "'Stone Cold' Steve Austin Names His Favorite WWE Rivals",
    "description": "WWE Hall of Famer \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin named two performers while discussing his greatest pro wrestling rivals.",
    "fullText": "\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin had a long list of rivals throughout his 13-year career, with The Rock, Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle being among some of the best. According to \"The Rattlesnake,\" however, one wrestler stands above the rest as his greatest in-ring adversary.\n\nSpeaking on \"Insight\" with Chris Van Vliet, Austin named Bret Hart as his best rival inside the squared circle, stating that nobody could match the chemistry he had with \"The Hitman.\" According to Austin, their contrasting personas complimented each other.\n\n\"Bret Hart's the best there is, the best there was, there ever will be,\" Austin said. \"Bret, I love working with that guy. We just had instant chemistry. He was a student of the game and a student of other promotions and he had seen what I was doing in WCW, the Stunning Steve Austin, and he knew his style and my style would work well together and it did. Just a trash talking heel that I was, and he was that steady workaholic, working babyface ... I'm very thankful to that guy because he meant a lot to my career.\"\n\nDespite Hart being his best in-ring nemesis, Austin admitted that the biggest rival of his career was undoubtedly former WWE CEO Vince McMahon.\n\n\"Vince, great chemistry,\" he claimed. \"He was the mastermind. I don't know what he's doing now, but that was a feud that transcended the wrestling business. And even if you weren't a wrestling fan, per se, you were interested in being entertained. And so you would put on to see what this motherf****r from South Texas is terrorizing his boss from New York City.\"\n\nAlthough McMahon was Austin's greatest rival, when it came to taking his iconic Stunner, the former Chairman was arguably the worst at selling the move according to the six-time WWE Champion.\n\n\"Easily Vince is the worst,\" Austin said. \"Vince had so many opportunities and they were always so awful, especially that one at WrestleMania, whichever one it was. It was the one with Kevin Owens. ... It was just terrible, and so, I had to start laughing because I mean, you got to let everybody know that, hey man, this is really bad.\"\n\nAustin admitted that Vince's wife, Linda McMahon, also ranks high on the all-time worst Stunners list. He feels bad that the move didn't go as planned, but Austin credited her for being a second mom to him during his WWE career.\n\nThe WWE star then named which of his opponents were the best at taking the Stunner, explaining that The Rock and Scott Hall are among some of his favorites, but praised Austin Theory and Pat McAfee for the way they sold the move at WrestleMania 38.\n\n\"Good kid. I thought man, the sky was the limit for him. He took a great one. McAfee took a great one ... of course when he tumbled out of the ring, he was still drinking the beer while he's laying on the mat. F*****g classic. What an entertainer.\"\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "It’s one last transfer window hurrah for Don Fabio.",
    "fullText": "I think most Tottenham Hotspur fans expected that current Co-Sporting Director Fabio Paratici was leaving the club imminently. The rumors have been flying for weeks now, with Paratici closely linked with a return to Italy to take the Director of Football position at Fiorentina. The only question was when, and now according to David Ornstein we have our answer — Paratici will leave Spurs for “personal reasons” after the close of the January transfer window.\n\nSo this month is the last hurrah for Don Fabio, who will return to Italy after one final scattergun transfer window in order to spend more time with his crimes. It makes a certain amount of sense — whatever Tottenham’s medium-to-long-term plans for the Sporting Director position (and that includes Johan Lange) it would be a little silly to let them both go now when the current window is so incredibly important. It makes you wonder how much his heart is actually in it, but I suppose the job is the job and he’ll do his job until it’s no longer his job.\n\nOrnstein cites “personal reasons” as the reason for Paratici’s departure despite only getting the Co-Sporting Director position in October, and while I won’t dwell too much on what those reasons actually are, there were rumors in the Italian media that Paratici’s partner was homesick and wanted to return to Italy. On that level, I can’t exactly blame him — all things being equal I would also strongly consider leaving London for a life in Florence, though Paratici will have a heck of a job ahead of him turning around a Fiorentina side that looks destined for Serie B next season.\n\nAnyway, at least we know the plan. Hopefully he and Lange can “Bentancur” up a couple more Kulusevskis before he rides off into Northern Italy next month.",

But for Celtics point guard Derrick White, it was a handful of high-leverage calls that he feels were missed that were a bigger concern than any potential longer-term issue with the officiating the Celtics may be dealing with.\n\nAsked about the refereeing of the game, and whether Boston was feeling frustrated with their whistle in the loss, the University of Colorado - Boulder alum said \"I don’t know if it bothered us.\"\n\n\"I think we shoot the least amount of free throws in the league, so it’s not a surprise, I would say,\" added White.\n\n\"But I think there’s some calls that are bigger than others that sometimes get missed and obviously the one at the end of the half was I was really frustrated about, which cost us two points,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I mean, I don’t know.

Despite making 19 appearances in all competitions, scoring three goals, he has started just five games in the Premier League.\n\nIn a bid to make a last-minute push to make the France squad ahead of the FIFA World Cup, Tel is in search of more game time in the second-half of the season and so he is open to leaving Tottenham.\n\nShould he do so, there is plenty of interest. AS Roma and Villarreal are among the interested parties, as are Paris FC, who are looking to stave off relegation. Hawkins understands, however, that Spurs are looking to retain their centre-forward.",

It was another dominant week for Sabalenka, who continues to build her legacy on tour.\n\nSabalenka went into Brisbane as the top seed and made her way through a competitive draw that included wins over Madison Keys and Karolina Muchova before finishing with another strong showing against Kostyuk.\n\nSabalenka has since posted on social media to mark the occasion, sharing on Instagram: “Thank you Brisbane International for all the love, it feels so good to be back.\n\n“Gummy bears and playing doubles with Paula Badosa made this tournament even better. Australia, we are just getting started.”\n\nIn addition to her singles success, Sabalenka also teamed up with Paula Badosa in doubles play. The two, who share a strong friendship off the court, made an appearance together during the tournament.\n\nThey won their first match of the event but did not compete in their scheduled quarter-final shortly after.\n\nSabalenka’s words are bound to catch the attention of the rest of the WTA Tour, especially given how sharp she looks at this stage of the season.\n\nShe clearly enjoys playing in Australia, and her current form only adds to her reputation as a player who thrives in these conditions.\n\nAs the top seed, she is set to compete in the Australian Open, a hard-court event where she has secured two of her four Grand Slam titles.\n\nHaving also reached the 2025 final, the Belarusian lost to Madison Keys. Meanwhile, Sabalenka has now achieved a remarkable record in Australia, winning 38 of her past 40 matches.\n\nThis kind of consistency makes Sabalenka a strong contender for another title run, and few will be surprised if she lifts the trophy again.",

    "fullText": "The Houston Texans are looking to make history on Monday night when they travel to Pittsburgh to take on the Steelers in the wild-card round.\n\nThe reason it would be history? Houston's never played a wild-card round game outside of NRG Stadium. And a win would mark the first victory away from home in franchise history.\n\nThe Texans’ wild-card round game will air on ESPN at 7 p.m. CT on Monday night. According to BETMGM, the Texans open as a 3.5-point favorite over the Colts, with the over/under set at 41.\n\nSitting at 12-5 following a 38-30 win over the Indianapolis Colts, the Texans are in great shape for a potential third straight wild-card round win. The Texans are also on the league's longest winning streak, rattling off nine straight to close out the campaign.\n\nAs for the Steelers, they're looking to finally win a playoff game for the first time since 2016. Aaron Rodgers hasn't thrown an interception since early November, while the team closed out the regular season winning five of their last six games, including a 28-26 win over the Ravens to clinch a division title on Sunday Night Football.\n\nWho are the experts riding with between the Steelers and Texans? Let's take a look and see which team is expected to win on Monday night at Acrisure Stadium.\n\nMichael Middlehurst-Schwartz: Texans\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: Texans vs. Colts: Experts make picks for Sunday's Week 18 game",

    "description": "Gabriel Martinelli was branded an \"idiot\" a few days ago - but showed great personality to respond with an FA Cup hat-trick, according to Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta.",
    "fullText": "From being branded an \"idiot\" to scoring a hat-trick, Gabriel Martinell's name has been in the headlines over the past few days.\n\nThe Arsenal winger was heavily criticised for trying to push the injured Conor Bradley off the pitch in the closing stages of Arsenal's 0-0 draw with Liverpool on Thursday, something he apologised for on social media.\n\nBut the 24-year-old's first hat-trick for Arsenal - as they came from behind to beat Championship outfit Portsmouth and reach the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday - showed \"personality\", according to his boss.\n\n\"It's part of football and then it's how you take it,\" Mikel Arteta when asked how Martinelli has dealt with being the subject of so much discussion.\n\n\"But he knew inside the reason why he did what he did.\"\n\nArteta also praised Liverpool boss Arne Slot for his considered response to the incident, when he defended the Brazilian.\n\n\"I think Arne Slot spoke brilliantly after the game - speaking of your opponent in the manner that he explained the situation and the fact that Gabi had no intention whatsoever to damage any player,\" added Arteta.\n\n\"That's personality. Come in and talk on the pitch, which is the best part of it.\"\n\nMartinelli has had a mixed season, losing his starting place in the Premier League to Leandro Trossard after a drop in form and confidence.\n\nHe has started just six times for the Gunners, who are six points clear at the top of the table.\n\nHowever, the winger has been a key player this season for Arsenal in Champions League, scoring five goals in as many appearances. And after his hat-trick against Portsmouth, he is now his side's top scorer.\n\n\"That's why to play for a big club, you need a big personality because it can be bad... it can be an action that you miss, it can be something that costs you a game,\" Arteta added\n\n\"And three days later, there is a game. So you need to lift yourself up and make it count.\n\n\"I love it. Gabi, in every context that you throw him in, he plays, he doesn't play. He performs well, not well. Today, he scored three goals.\n\n\"Tomorrow, he's going to train 100 miles an hour, for sure. He's not going to change that. And that's Gabi.\"\n\nMartinelli scores hat-trick as Arsenal beat Portsmouth\n\nArsenal hire ex-Liverpool throw-in coach Gronnemark\n\nMartinelli's hat-trick was the first scored by an Arsenal player in the FA Cup since Theo Walcott did so against Southampton in January 2017.\n\nIt was also his first in 249 games for the Gunners and the first time that he has scored more than two goals in a game for a year.\n\nArteta was not surprised that Martinelli, who is not known for his aerial ability, was able to score twice with his head from corners as \"his timing in the box is really good\".\n\nArsenal are well-known for their threat from set-pieces since the appointment of coach Nicolas Jover. They have scored 17 goals from corners in all competitions this season; the most by any Premier League team.\n\nBut even by the Gunners' impressive standards, scoring three in a game is a rare occurrence - this was the first time they had done so since May 2022 against Everton.\n\nThe game against Portsmouth was the first of four away games in four different competitions for Arsenal - with tests in the Carabao Cup, Premier League and Champions League to come.\n\nThey are hoping to end their wait for a trophy - with their last coming when Arteta led them to the 2020 FA Cup, where they beat Portsmouth on the way to lifting the cup.\n\nArsenal are in a strong position - top of both the Premier League and Champions League tables - while they have won nine of their 10 matches in cup competitions this season, including all five away from home, drawing once.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Python: What's Coming in 2026",
    "description": "Transformative shifts for Python might include the official support for free-threading, the introduction of lazy imports and more.",
    "fullText": "If 2025 was “the year of type checking and language server protocols” for Python, will 2026 be the year of the type server protocol? “Transformative” developments like free threading were said to be coming to Python in 2026, along with performance-improving “lazy” imports for Python modules. We’ll (hopefully) also be seeing improved Python agent frameworks.\n\nBut 2026 could even see a change in change itself — in the ways that Python changes are proposed.\n\nLast month, there was an illuminating seven-person conversation — including three of Python’s core developers, two of whom are also members of Python’s Steering Council. As 2025 came to a close, these prominent guests came together for a special year-in-review episode of the “Talk Python to Me” podcast, discussing what trends they’d seen in 2025 — but also what they see coming in the year ahead for Python and its developer community.\n\nFrom the beginning, the podcast showed that Python is still a broad-based global community. From Vancouver came Brett Cannon, a Python core developer since 2003, and a Microsoft principal software engineer for over 10 years. And what Cannon saw in 2025 was advances in people running Python code using tools.\n\nWhere before you’d install the Python interpreter — and then also any needed dependencies — to then launch everything in a virtual environment, “Now we’ve got tools that will compress all that into a run command!” A growing set of tools like Hatch, BDM and uv “build on each other and … just slowly build up this repertoire of tool approaches.”\n\nThis caught the attention of Python’s core developers. “These tools treat Python as an implementation detail, almost,” Cannon said. The Python interpreter just fades into the background as “a thing that they pull in to make your code run.”\n\nAlso on the call was Barry Warsaw, who has been a Python core developer for more than 30 years. He told Cannon, “I think you’re really onto something.” Warsaw is also on the 2026 Python Steering Council (while currently working on Python at Nvidia), and sees this as an even larger trend — “a renewed focus on the user experience.”\n\nJust installing the binary with the Python interpreter can be complicated for new users, but 2024 saw Python adding a format for metadata to embed in Python scripts to help IDEs, launchers and other external tools. So in the world of 2025, it’s now that much easier to write code that will be run by Python. “You can put uv in the shebang line of your script — and now you don’t have to think about anything. And Hatch can work the same way for developers.”\n\nThis drew some enthusiastic agreement from Associate CS Professor Gregory Kapfhammer. Dialing in from Pittsburgh (where he’s already using uv in his classes at Allegheny College), Kapfhammer said he’s amazed how much uv had simplified lessons for his students. “I don’t have to teach them about Docker containers, and I don’t have to tell them how to install Python with some package manager.”\n\nAnd from Berlin came more agreement from Jodie Burchell, a 10-year data scientist (now a developer advocate at JetBrains, working on PyCharm). Burchell said they’re even discussing whether to use uv at the data science mentoring community Humble Data (where she’s one of the organizers). “It does abstract away all these details. The debate I have is, is it too magic?” And as a developer advocate at JetBrains, “It’s also a debate we have in PyCharm. How much do you magic away the fundamentals versus making people think a little bit?”\n\nThis led to a discussion about possible future developments in Python. Core developer Cannon said that for the troubleshooters — and even just for the curious — “I want the magic to decompose. You should be able to explain the ‘magic’ path via more decomposed steps using the tool all the way down to what the tools actually do behind the scenes.” And it’s not just a hypothetical for him. “I’ve been thinking about this a lot,” Cannon said, because “I’m thinking of trying to get the Python launcher to do a bit more.”\n\nAfter all, uv is still made by a company (named Astral), and “There’s always the risk they might disappear.” And a lot of work has now been put in place to create standards for this kind of packaging, including that metadata addition.\n\n2026 will also bring performance-improving “lazy imports,” which will speed start-up times by deferring until first use the importing of modules. “It’s been accepted, and it’s going to be awesome,” said Core Developer Thomas Wouters. Dialing in from Amsterdam, Wouters has also deployed Python internally at Google, where he worked for 17 years before moving to Meta. He’s been a board member of the Python Software Foundation — even receiving their Distinguished Service Award in 2025 — and is a current member of 2026’s Python steering council.\n\nWouters is even more excited about Python’s progress toward adding parallel processing capabilities. Thinking of how Python’s Global Interpreter Lock notoriously slowed down performance by enforcing single-thread processing, Wouters phrased this development indelicately as “the global interpreter lock is going away! I am stating it as a fact — it’s not actually a fact yet, but that’s because the Steering Council hasn’t realized the fact yet.”\n\nWouters said this because he was on the Steering Council that accepted an alternative — free-threading — as an experimental feature, and now for Python 3.14, “It is officially supported. The performance is great … It’s basically the same speed on MacOS … That’s a combination of the ARM hardware and clang specializing things … And then on recent GCCs on Linux, it’s like a couple percent slower.”\n\n2026 will see a focus on community adoption, said Wouters, “getting third-party packages to update their extension modules for the new APIs” and “supporting free-threading in a good way.” But for Python code, “it turns out there’s very few changes that need to be made for things to work well under free-threading.”\n\nAnd more to the point, “We’ve seen a lot of examples of really promising, very parallel problems that now speed up by 10x or more. And it’s going to be really exciting in the future.”\n\nThe biggest change may have been suggested by Barry Warsaw. As the creator of Python Enhancement Proposals — the procedure for changing the language — Warsaw brings real credibility when he said, “We have to rethink how we evolve Python — and how we propose changes to Python, and how we discuss those changes in the community.”\n\nThe current process is over a quarter of a century old, and while the developer community is “somewhat larger,” Warsaw said there’s been a more exponential growth in “the number of people who are using Python and who have an interest in it.” But more to the point, “One of the things that I’ve heard over and over and over again is that authoring Python Enhancement Proposals is incredibly difficult, and emotionally draining. It’s a time sink, and leading those discussions on discuss.Python.org … can be toxic at times, and very difficult.”\n\nThe end result? “It has become really difficult to evolve the language and the standard library and the interpreter … We need to think about how we can make this easier for people and not lose the voice of the user.”\n\nWhen it comes to the Python community, comments left at discuss.python.org are “the tip of the iceberg,” Warsaw said. “We’ve got millions and millions of users out there in the world who, for example, lazy imports will affect — free threading will affect. And yet they don’t even know that they have a voice.” Warsaw hopes to represent them “in a much more collaborative and positive way.”\n\nSo in 2026, Warsaw said, “I think this is something I’m going to spend some time on, trying to think about — you know, and talk to people about — ways we can make this easier for everyone.”\n\nWarsaw shared an interesting observation on where we are now. “There have been changes that have been made to Python that really should have been a PEP. And they aren’t because … core developers don’t want to go through this gauntlet!\n\n“But that’s also not good because then, you know, we don’t have the right level of consideration.”\n\nKapfhammer shared an important tip, pointing out that “If you can teach your AI agent to use the type checkers and use the LSPs, it will also generate better code for you.” It’s giving the large language model (LLM) one more useful piece of information and context — and the industry is starting to take notice. Kapfhammer said the team behind Meta’s type checker is working directly with Pydantic AI to create interoperability, “So that when you’re building an AI agent using Pydantic AI, you can also then have better guarantees when you’re using Pyrefly as your type checker.”\n\nIn fact, for Kapfhammer, 2025 was “the year of type checking and language server protocols.” He uses the static type checker Mypy and language server protocols like Pyright or PyLance. But 2025 also brought Meta’s Pyrefly type checker/LSP, Astral’s ty and a new type checker/LSP called Zuban. He notes these 2025 tools were all implemented in Rust — and are “significantly faster,” which changes how he uses the tools, and how often. “It’s helped me to take things that might take tens of seconds or hundreds of seconds, and cut them down often to less than a second.”\n\nCannon noted that “It takes more work to write Rust code than it does to write Python code,” and applauded the tool makers for being willing to shoulder that extra effort to deliver “an overall win for the community.”\n\nBut Cannon also seemed to have some high hopes for what we’ll see in 2026. “Pylance is actually working with the Pyrefly team to define a type server protocol [TSP] so that a lot of these type servers can just kind of feed the type information to a higher-level LSP, and let that LSP handle the stuff like symbol renaming and all that stuff.”\n\nThe podcast was hosted by Michael Kennedy, a Portland-based Python enthusiast and educator, who gave the 84-minute conversation — and the year ahead — a perfect summation.\n\n“I still think it’s an incredibly exciting time to be a developer or a data scientist. There’s so much opportunity out there … Every day is slightly more amazing than the previous day … I love it.”",

    "fullText": "HEBER CITY, Utah — An artificial intelligence that writes police reports had some explaining to do earlier this month after it claimed a Heber City officer had shape-shifted into a frog.\n\nHowever, the truth behind that so-called magical transformation is simple.\n\n\"The body cam software and the AI report writing software picked up on the movie that was playing in the background, which happened to be 'The Princess and the Frog,'\" Sgt. Keel told FOX 13 News. “That’s when we learned the importance of correcting these AI-generated reports.”\n\nEarlier this month, the department began testing two pieces of AI software, Draft One and Code Four. Code Four was created by George Cheng and Dylan Nguyen, both 19 years old and MIT dropouts, kicked off earlier this year. The software generates police reports from body camera footage in hopes of reducing paperwork and allowing officers to be out in the field more.\n\nDraft One was the software used to create the Disney-inspired police report.\n\nTo see how Code Four works, FOX 13 News rode along with Keel for a demonstration as the department staged a mock traffic stop.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Rick with the Heber PD. The reason I'm stopping you today is for...\" Keel said during the demonstration.\n\nBack at the police department, the AI generated a report with timestamps from the mock traffic stop. The software works in both English and Spanish and can track tone and sentiment as people are talking.\n\nKeel says one of the major draws is that the software saves them time, as writing reports typically takes 1-2 hours.\n\n\"I'm saving myself about 6-8 hours weekly now,\" Keel said. \"I'm not the most tech-savvy person, so it's very user-friendly.\"\n\nCode Four costs about $30 per officer each month. Keel said the trial run for Code Four wraps up next month, but department officials say they plan to continue using the AI technology; it's just a matter of which system.",

    "description": "Mario Miralles spent decades acquiring the spruce and maple for string instruments worthy of Yo-Yo Ma and Gustavo Dudamel. Then he was forced to evacuate.",
    "fullText": "Angry orange flames crackled in every direction. Mario Miralles was hiking more than two miles into a canyon northeast of Los Angeles, clearing fallen tree limbs off the road to create a possible escape path.\n\nHe desperately needed to reach his cabin in the forest, his place of refuge, where he had crafted world-class violins for decades. When he and his girlfriend, Noël Shimizu, made it to the workshop at last, he felt himself spinning as he scanned the room and wondered: “What can’t I afford to live without?”\n\nShe told him to take his hang-glider harness. He would surely need to decompress, she reasoned, whenever all the chaos ended.\n\nHe scooped up his brother’s Martin guitar. He could not fathom letting it burn.\n\nAnd he seized a violin he had been making for the better part of 10 years. It was almost finished. He owed it to the conductor Gustavo Dudamel.\n\nA year later, the breadth of the Eaton fire’s destruction in Altadena, Calif., is vast: residents killed, thousands of buildings destroyed, a neighborhood forever changed and a deep wound to Miralles’s livelihood.\n\nMiralles, 62, is a renowned luthier who has made a cello for Yo-Yo Ma, violins for decorated musicians, and countless string instruments for principal players and young students alike. His craftsmanship and expertise are prized. “Every maker’s personality is imprinted — like their DNA is part of the instrument,” said the violinist Anne Akiko Meyers.\n\nMaking a world-class string instrument requires world-class wood. And gathering that wood required frequent trips to European vendors over a career of more than 40 years.\n\nLike a wine enthusiast, Miralles had refined his collection. Spruce from the Dolomites in Italy for the tops of the instruments. Maple from countries in and around Bosnia for the backs, sides and necks. Cello wood that was at least 150 years old. He might spend three days at a vendor and end up with five pieces, some of which cost as much as $5,000 each.\n\nHe kept his collection in a rented storage unit before moving it into an insulated shed outside his home in Altadena, a suburb tucked beneath the mountains where he had spent much of his childhood. Sometime in 2024, he allowed himself two thoughts: “I finally have enough wood for the rest of my life” and “I love it all.”\n\nThe house was a place for Miralles to interact with customers and also to protect his raw materials, his artwork, his copious notes and his grandfather’s drafting tools — “all the stuff that I wanted to make sure was safe,” he said. It brought him comfort that there was a fire station just down the street.\n\nMiralles, one of seven children to architects, was a decent cellist as a child, but his interest fizzled as a teenager. After he returned to music, he applied to the Violin Making School of America in Salt Lake City, where he met Peter Beare, the son of an internationally renowned violin expert.\n\nBeare, who helps run the family company, would invite Miralles to London to study Stradivari violins. Even after Miralles won recognition when one of his cellos was entered into a competition, all he wanted to do was go to Europe to learn more.\n\n“The great instruments are better teachers than any living human,” Beare said.\n\nMiralles realized that though he had learned a very Germanic and symmetrical method of instrument making, there was nothing uniform about the great 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century pieces he was inspecting. He became fixated on unearthing century-old transcripts and unraveling complex geometric designs.\n\nHe also observed that some of the most sublime instruments seemed to be made of the same kinds of wood. He became a “nightmare for wood dealers,” he said. He would measure a plank’s flexibility, its weight, its density. He would examine its figure and grain width. He found that by drawing his thumbnail across certain wood, he could almost strum it: hard grain, soft grain, hard, soft. He could listen, and hear how a piece would transmit sound.\n\nBusiness exploded after Miralles made a violin for the principal of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1996. When Ma approached to ask him for an instrument, which these days can cost $50,000 to $80,000, Miralles replied: “You’ll have to wait three-and-a-half years.”\n\nMeyers entrusts Miralles to care for her own extraordinary instrument, crafted by Guarneri del Gesù in 1741, and has played Dudamel’s violin at a concert. “It sings,” she said. “It has this resonance through it that is clearly Mario’s sound.”\n\nThat Miralles saved the instrument during last year’s deadly wildfires in Altadena and the Pacific Palisades gives it extra meaning for Dudamel, who will finalize his transition from the Los Angeles Philharmonic to the New York Philharmonic this year.\n\n“It carries the memory of resilience, strength and hope in the face of destruction,” Dudamel said in a statement. He added, “Every time I play it, I am reminded of how the people of Los Angeles rose with humanity, generosity and grace during a moment of profound loss.”\n\nWhen Shimizu, Miralles’s girlfriend, insisted they evacuate his cabin on Jan. 7, 2025, he could not be bothered. He was buried in his work. Still, they packed up and drove west to Shimizu’s home.\n\nIt was only when Miralles got a text from his ex-wife at 3:27 the next morning that he became concerned. She was being ordered to leave their Altadena house and would flee with nothing but a laptop.\n\nSo that afternoon Miralles decided to see what he could save. High winds had whipped trees and power lines onto the road. As he and Shimizu drove through the smoke, they passed burning houses and could make out the figures of firefighters standing helplessly nearby, without any water to use.\n\nThe roads were closed. So they parked in southern Altadena and began to hike. They would stop at his home, a little cottage made of beautiful redwood, on the way to the cabin. He wanted to see if his home and the precious cache of wood in the shed were OK.\n\nBut even from a distance, Miralles could tell that the house was gone. He walked up to the smoldering rubble anyway. He felt its heat.\n\nThe fire had reduced the shed — and all of the wood within it — to ash.\n\nMiralles put his hands on his knees and leaned forward as if he might suddenly collapse. Instead, he circled what was left of the structures and said, “It’s all gone.”\n\nThey stayed for only five minutes. The sun was setting, the winds could pick up and they needed to get to the cabin. After rescuing Dudamel’s violin and his brother’s guitar from it, he hiked back out, assuming the cabin would be destroyed.\n\nMiraculously, it is still standing, even though many of the buildings nearby are completely gone. But the roads have been impassable for months. And although he is still trying to assess the damage, the cabin is uninhabitable.\n\nHis house in Altadena has not yet been rebuilt.\n\n“Almost every night I wake up with a nightmare about something that I’ve lost,” Miralles said.\n\nSomeone might ask for a grinder and he happily offers his own, only to realize he does not have one anymore. He might seek to start on a new instrument, only for it to dawn that he must redo his meticulous drawings.\n\nA season hang-gliding in Europe helped his recovery. Friends from that community brought him clothes in the days after the fire and helped raise funds so he could get by. Another violin maker invited Miralles to Providence, R.I., so he could finish Dudamel’s instrument without distraction.\n\nThese days, Miralles is mostly doing repair work. The Colburn School in downtown Los Angeles offered him an office, and he has enjoyed helping high school and college-age students when they drop by, with their enthusiastic smiles and sharp ears.\n\n“He’s kind of a Zen master at assessing what’s wrong with an instrument,” said Margaret Batjer, the director of Colburn’s music academy and the concertmaster of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, Miralles plunged his gouges and planes into wood to begin crafting a pair of cellos, his first new instruments since the fire. The carving felt good, said Miralles, who has also found joy in rebuilding his wood collection. Friends donated some of their own, and during his travels he visited some favorite vendors.\n\nIn his adopted office, a few seemingly unremarkable planks rest against the wall, atop a cabinet. He had coveted one in the past but could not afford it then, so the vendors set it aside. Now was the time to finally make the purchase: a piece of maple, cut more than 100 years ago, that could sing for centuries.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're discussing the proposed tax on billionaires that's dividing the tech elite.",
    "fullText": "California's billionaires are at a crossroads.\n\nOne of the biggest business stories kicking off the year is the proposed wealth tax in California. The state's rich and powerful, worth more than $1 billion, would face a one-time 5% tax on their assets if the plan gets approved.\n\nThe proposal, which aims to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit, has prompted plenty of grumbling among the California elite.\n\nAs Business Insider first reported, some have already taken action, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nPage converted his secretive family office out of California in late December and incorporated it in Delaware, according to my colleague Hugh Langley's exclusive reporting. Page also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures. He lists principal office addresses outside of California for those entities.\n\nSeparately, an entity tied to both Brin and Page moved out of California at the end of 2025.\n\nThe timing of these moves is crucial. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. Hence, the rush to move assets before the end of the year.\n\nBrin and Page are two of the richest people on the planet, with a combined net worth north of half a trillion dollars, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a very different tone. He said he's \"perfectly fine\" with the tax and gave no indication he plans to leave Silicon Valley, even if it costs him.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic. LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman called the proposal \"horrendous\" for innovation, warning that poorly designed wealth taxes don't raise reliable revenue — they push money and talent elsewhere.\n\nAlex Spiro, the celebrity lawyer who represents several billionaires, sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom last month warning that the tax would drive capital and innovation out of California.\n\nEarlier this month, White House AI Czar David Sacks predicted Austin would overtake San Francisco as the American tech hub. His social media post ricocheted throughout tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from traditionalists.\n\nWhere do you stand on the proposed billionaire's tax in California?

    "description": "My sons love crafting with duct tape, cardboard, and trash. It keeps their imaginations going during winter when they can't play outside.",
    "fullText": "In the Midwest, we experience all four seasons — sometimes multiple in a single day. My boys, 6 and 8, love spending time outside, but in the winter, when temperatures drop, or there's a storm, they're often stuck indoors away from the cold.\n\nEnter the most genius parenting idea I have ever been gifted. When a friend sent me a Reel about moms collecting \"interesting trash,\" my husband and I knew it would be an immediate hit. In the Reel, letting your kids create with such trash was referred to as \"free-range crafting, and my husband went out to buy two rolls of duct tape so we could try it with our kids — since then, we've never looked back. That first day, they spent hours cutting random pieces of cardboard we had, taping things together, and inventing anything their imagination could think up.\n\nThey've been \"free-range crafting\" for a few months now, and their excitement about it has only grown, along with our supply of boxes and tape. Christmas brought tons of lids, packaging, plastic plates and cups, and more.\n\nAdditionally, my husband brings home broken tractor parts that are safe for them to use. He's a diesel mechanic, and they enjoy finding new use for the metal shapes that would otherwise be trash. I also save yogurt containers, milk jugs — basically anything that can be easily cleaned and won't cause injury.\n\nThey also received cool-touch hot glue guns and their own packs of masking tape. (They had been asking to use tape on the floors, so now they are able to do that.) A bonus is that Grandma got them rolls of colored tape, so they've decorated half their room.\n\nI also added actual craft supplies to their stash that I didn't mind them getting into — the whole goal is they can do as they please with these things — including yarn, watercolors, markers, scissors, and ribbon. (Balloons and kabob sticks, on the other hand, were quickly vetoed.) They usually grab things from their room as well.\n\nTechnically, they are supposed to stay in one room of the house while working on their masterpiece craft project. That rarely happens, however, as their creativity leads them to grab new parts and soon they're spread out into the living room, hallway, and more.\n\nIf they are playing well, I let it happen and just make sure they pick up that evening. It's all kept in a large cardboard box in their crafting space. I don't care if it looks neat, as long as it's contained. They are also only allowed to craft when the weather doesn't cooperate. Any hint of nice weather means they are going outside to play.\n\nMy oldest, who loves soldiers and weapons, has built countless play knives. He builds them and uses them to play army or spies, a common pastime in our house. He has also built vehicles and cut cardboard pieces to use as a barn or shed while playing.\n\nMeanwhile, my youngest opts for robots or spaceships. He turned a broken U-joint from a tractor into his very own robot, named Robesy, who became so important that he came along on the family's 16-hour holiday road trip. Both of my boys enjoy having the ability to create whatever item they need to complete their playtime vision.\n\nEven after getting way too much for Christmas, they continue to play and build. They are using their imagination and remaining creative without begging to watch TV or get on a device. Yes, there are bits of cardboard and tape all over my house, and yes, we are going through record amounts of tape and glue, but it's a fun pastime they enjoy, and we love watching what they create.",

    "description": "Stephen Hutyra was inspired by a Facebook post to build a pub in his backyard. He spent $61,000 and created the space of his dreams.",
    "fullText": "Stephen Hutyra was scrolling Facebook in November 2020 when a post caught his attention.\n\nIt showed a couple in England who'd built a small pub in their backyard. Their design was simple, but inspiring.\n\nThe 42-year-old program analyst, who lives in the small town of West, Texas, immediately started imagining what it'd be like to have his own.\n\n\"We have a saying that everything is bigger and better in Texas,\" he told Business Insider. \"So I wanted our pub to be bigger and better than the one I saw in the picture.\"\n\nHutyra asked his wife if she'd be on board, and as soon as she said yes, he began buying furniture on Facebook Marketplace — despite not having a structure yet.\n\nHe later took out a bank loan, enlisted a contractor, and spent months perfecting his dream space. Now, Hutyra is the proud owner of The Thirsty Goat, a private pub built right in his backyard.\n\nHutyra told Business Insider that he'd joined the Navy right after high school and was first stationed in England. He lived in the seaside town of Newquay, where he'd frequent its various nightlife spots.\n\n\"I fell in love with all the pubs, and walking down the street to hang out with both Navy and local friends I'd made,\" he said. \"I'd really missed that part of my life.\"\n\nSo when he saw a Facebook post about a UK couple building a small pub in their backyard, a lightbulb went off: Hutyra could create his own in his Texas backyard.\n\nFor years, the grassy area had been Hutyra's space to store wood and let the family dogs play.\n\nAs soon as he envisioned a backyard pub, though, he knew the open land was the perfect spot.\n\n\"I almost immediately started making floor plans, buying tables and chairs off Facebook Marketplace, decor off Amazon, and bar items on eBay,\" he said.\n\nHutyra also started to virtually design the future pub. He spent hours on Facebook, Pinterest, and Google, where he found inspiration and added ideas to a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n\"My wife and I were driving back from a vacation in Port Aransas on the Texas coastline, and I said we had to make a pit stop at a bank to sign some loan papers,\" Hutyra said. \"She asked what for, and I said, 'The pub. You gave me your blessing a long time ago.'\"\n\nShe laughed, Hutyra entered the bank, and the couple later left with a $44,320 loan. They also got a permit to build the structure.\n\nA month later, in August 2023, the Hutyras had a contractor on-site who broke ground and began building.\n\nHutyra had never taken on a project of this size, so hiring a contractor was crucial.\n\nHe first paid them $600 to draw actual building construction plans, inspired by the PowerPoint presentation Hutyra had put together.\n\nFrom there, the team helped run vital water and electricity lines, create the pub's concrete base, and craft its shell, framing, and roof. They also added foam insulation.\n\nContractors worked until November 2023, at which point the pub was turned over to Hutyra.\n\nHe got to work with the help of his son and father, who Hutyra described as a master carpenter and overall handyman, to complete the build.\n\nTogether, they installed ceilings, painted walls, stained wood, added shelving, built the pub's bar, and more.\n\n\"I had about three years to plan, so when the time came, I knew where I wanted everything to be,\" Hutyra said. \"I had it planned down to the light switches.\"\n\nWhen you enter the pub, you're greeted by a dark-wood bar with string-light decor and matching stools.\n\nThere are also tables and chairs throughout, televisions above the door, and framed photos around the room.\n\nA chalkboard tells you which drinks are available, and if you visit during the holidays, you'll see glowing Christmas trees.\n\nSimilar to the rest of the bar, the bathroom has dark-wood panelling, framed photo decor, and running water.\n\n\"All the shelving that goes around the top of the pub, I did myself, but the bar was probably the biggest challenge for me,\" Hutyra said. \"I had to make a lot of cuts at different angles, and make sure it was straight and level. It was a lot of work.\"\n\nHutyra has spent 24 years in the Navy and currently serves as a chief petty officer. Naturally, the inspiration behind his pub's name came from his years of service.\n\n\"The goat is kind of like the official mascot for the Navy,\" he said. \"In the earlier days of the service, goats were kept aboard ships to provide fresh meat and milk to the crew. Other livestock didn't fare as well.\"\n\nThe area where the goats were kept was named the Goat Locker, he said, and the phrase has stuck around for more than 200 years. Now, it's the name for the chief's working quarters.\n\nWith that in mind, he named his pub The Thirsty Goat.\n\n\"I've been in the reserves the last 19 years now, and I've traveled the world and seen a lot of different places and things,\" Hutyra said. \"But I've always returned to my hometown. After buying a house here, I've really started to feel that family connection.\"\n\nSo he wanted to feel it in his pub, too. Hutyra has a jar from 1903 that belonged to his great-grandmother, which now sits on his bar as a tip jar. The bar itself also has ties to his ancestors.\n\nAs Hutyra was building his pub, a nearby homestead barn — built and owned by his great-great-great-grandfather around 1880 — was being demolished, so he salvaged some materials.\n\n\"The wood was actually in a remarkable condition,\" Hutyra said. \"I took floorboards from the second-story hayloft, which were under the roof of the barn, so they were out of the rain and weather.\"\n\n\"My father and I brought the wood back to his woodworking shop just across town, a few miles from my childhood home, where he still lives today,\" he added.\n\nTogether, they turned that wood into the top of Hutyra's bar, which is now the focal point of his pub.\n\nHutyra said that he and his wife always dreamed of owning a big house where they could have parties and host friends and family.\n\nNow, their personal pub has become that dream spot.\n\n\"We find ourselves sitting out here in the middle of the week until midnight, or until 2 or 3 a.m. on the weekends with family and friends,\" he said. \"We've thoroughly enjoyed it since finishing back in August, but we're only just starting to see how much we're going to use it.\"",

    "description": "The nearly 14,000 square-foot store offers free coffee and a place to hang out, but I probably won't be back.",
    "fullText": "At 4:45 pm on Wednesdays, I'm used to hearing my editors discuss the evening's stories. This week, I eavesdropped on a conversation about the similarities between a coffee pod and an oxidized avocado.\n\nI was visiting Nespresso's new flagship location in Manhattan's tourist-heavy Flatiron district, a well-lit, open-air space that feels almost like an Apple store. The Nestlé-owned coffee company opened the nearly 14,000 square-foot store in December, billing its now-largest retail space as \"a destination for modern coffee culture\" in a press release.\n\nPart of the store's big draw is the free coffee, and the self-service station features shiny machines and a wide array of pods. An extremely friendly employee approached me asking if I have a Nespresso — I don't — before explaining how the \"bright, citrusy\" Tanzania coffee pod compares to Velluto, which is like \"the house wine of coffee.\" She gave me instructions for using the machine, displaying the patience and helpful rhyming tips befitting a kindergarten teacher as I somehow fumbled with the two buttons.\n\nAfter having my double shot of Tanzania, which actually was quite bright and citrusy, I wandered over to the smelling station, where you can sniff 12 different brews. As I determined my favorite scent, I kept thinking about something that chef and restaurateur Jeremy Fall, the man behind this summer's viral Hamptons smoothie, told me a few months ago: \"The way people look at drinks is that they sort of say a lot about their identity.\"\n\nThe store also tries to make Nespresso part of customers' identity, with its push toward personalization and finding your signature blend. After helping me make coffee, the employee made sure to tell me that if I buy a glass cup, I can get it engraved with any personal message for free.\n\n\"If it's free, it's for me!\" she told me. The store emphasizes its free offerings, including a barista class and complimentary coffee, yet I couldn't shake my awareness that the whole point is to make me buy stuff. The walls are lined with mugs, nanofoamers, barista recipe makers, flavored syrups, Nespresso machines, pod holders, and even bag charms à la Labubu.\n\nYet there is also the genuine possibility of simply hanging out. Two employees let me know that the store's secret, hidden coffee speakeasy opened at 5 pm, tucked behind a painting on the lower level.\n\nI stepped inside around 5:15 pm, and a line had formed by 5:20 pm. The mocktail bar offered three drinks, and I went with \"The Hidden Fizz\" after the bartender said it was the most refreshing. The $15 drink was the only item I paid for during my visit.\n\nDespite the trappings of a speakeasy, the space didn't feel private, especially since multiple employees told me to visit. In the dim lighting and over an unidentifiable jazz song, people took pictures or chatted quietly.\n\nThough I generally avoid fruit-coffee combos, I liked the drink more than expected. I forced my coworkers, Henry and Ana, to meet me at the store and try it, too. Henry agreed that it was OK if a little too sweet, and didn't realize it had any coffee; Ana was \"literally obsessed.\"\n\nThere's also a lounge downstairs, with self-service coffee, couches, a chessboard, and a record player. When I walked in, an employee, dressed in the store's characteristic beige, stood at a counter reading \"How to Taste Coffee.\" Other books dotted the space, many of them focused on nature despite our being underground in New York City: multiple editions of \"Great Escapes,\" a photography collection featuring outdoor athletes, and a selection of works by the chronically outside painter Monet.\n\nMuch like Starbucks, it seems that the Nespresso flagship wants to be a third space, an informal social place beyond home or work. And to an extent, it accomplishes the goal — two guys at the chess table sat discussing H-1B visas, while two women huddled on a couch without even holding coffee cups.\n\nI don't see myself coming back, mainly because I'd prefer to spend my time in a smaller, local New York City café, but partly because of the not-so-subtle push to make me identify with, and identify myself by, the brand. Yet for those who don't mind that and can fight the impulse to buy Nespresso products, the store can serve as a rare spot to get a free coffee and sit on a plush sofa.",

    "title": "The merch wars have come to fast food",
    "description": "Fast food chains are expanding their retail offerings and seeking viral glory with collectable items, like cups, keychains, apparel, and tote bags.",
    "fullText": "Limited-edition cups, tote bags, and cartoonish keychains are the latest weapon in the restaurant industry's battle for consumer attention.\n\nAs restaurant margins remain tight and consumers become more price-sensitive, chains are expanding their retail offerings and increasingly turning to collectible merchandise as a way to signal increased value without resorting to discounting.\n\nThe strategy, experts say, taps into consumers' fear of missing out as well as their sense of identity — especially for younger generations, who see brands as social signals — while driving repeat visits, loyalty sign-ups, and viral buzz. The result is a low-cost, high-impact approach that helps restaurants stay culturally relevant and top of mind even as dining habits shift.\n\nStarbucks' Bearista cups are a recent and widely visible example. Released in limited quantities around the holidays, the cups sparked lines, sellouts, and sky-high resale listings — and, crucially, social-media chatter that had little to do with coffee itself. Ernie Ross, founder of the branding agency Ross Advertising, said the frenzy wasn't accidental.\n\n\"That scarcity of supply, that limited idea that this is only for an exclusive group of a few people, increases the value and worth of any item,\" Ross said. \"Some of the stores received less than 10 of the cups, yet they were promoting that you should come to Starbucks for this.\"\n\nRoss said scarcity reliably shifts consumer behavior, creating urgency and predictable \"queueing\" instincts that brands can harness in moments of pressure.\n\n\"If you tell us that something is scarce in supply, we desire it more,\" he said. It's just human nature, he added — if you see a group lining up for an item, you're going to want to jump in line, too.\n\nThe strategy is accelerating at a fraught moment for restaurants — especially in the middle of the market. Deloitte principal Evert Gruyaert said that restaurants, operating in a value-driven environment, are seeking ways to hold their core consumers' attention.\n\n\"The consumer today is increasingly looking for more value for the price,\" Gruyaert said. \"Now in the US, about 40% of consumers are really what we would call value-seekers.\"\n\nWhile many chains are also bolstering their value menus and slashing combo meal prices, continued discounting is not a viable long-term plan.\n\n\"Heavily discounting your menu is just not sustainable,\" Gruyaert said, noting that restaurants operate on \"very, very thin margins.\"\n\nCollectible merch, he said, offers a workaround.\n\n\"We call these full-margin promotions,\" Gruyaert said. \"You can still charge the full price of your meal, get your full margin on that, but you just get something extra.\"\n\nDunkin's recent mini tote bag promotion followed a similar logic. The chain offered branded totes to loyalty members who purchased a drink, encouraging repeat visits while tying the reward to app usage and data collection. Chick-fil-A has also leaned into collectibles with the launch of branded reusable cups, offering customers a chance at free meals for a year if they snag one of their rare gold designs.\n\n\"Most of this is all to drive additional traffic,\" Gruyaert said. \"It's also driving more frequency — collect them all, and you have a limited amount of time to do that.\"\n\nBeyond traffic, Gruyaert said merchandise is increasingly used to strengthen loyalty ecosystems, adding that exclusive items can replace free food as milestone rewards.\n\nJack in the Box's \"Jibbi\" keychains show how chains are also tapping into internet culture. The vinyl figures, which echo the viral Labubu collectible aesthetic popular among Gen Z, were rolled out as limited-edition items designed to spark social sharing. For branding experts, that cultural resonance is the point.\n\n\"For Gen Z, brands are actually a form of identity and social expression,\" Gruyaert said. \"A restaurant is not just competing on food itself anymore, but also on brand identity.\"\n\nNational Restaurant Association Chief Economist Chad Moutray said consumer demand is already there. He pointed to a recent NRA survey data showing that nearly half of adults are open to buying restaurant-branded apparel.\n\n\"Forty-four percent of adults say they're likely to purchase apparel such as sweatshirts and caps with a restaurant's name and logo,\" Moutray said. Among younger consumers, the numbers are even higher, with 65% of millennials and 55% of Gen Z adults reporting the same appeal.\n\nFor restaurants, Moutray said, merch serves a dual purpose: it's a way for them to extend their brands, while simultaneously operating as free marketing.\n\nThe revenue component of expanded retail offerings matters, too.\n\n\"The math is difficult for restaurants right now,\" Moutray said. \"Costs have risen pretty significantly, and there's a hesitance to pass those on to the consumer.\"\n\nThat makes non-food revenue streams more attractive, allowing chains to extend their brand while also diversifying their revenue.\n\nWhile collectibles aren't new — fast-food toys and promotional giveaways have been staples for decades — experts say the current wave is broader, more intentional, and more culturally attuned. Cross-brand collaborations, like Chipotle's line of college dorm decor with Urban Outfitters, have further amplified the effect.\n\n\"If you have two brands that are tapping into that same consumer segment, that's where the magic can happen,\" Gruyaert said. \"These things are sold out in no time, and they have the potential to go viral.\"\n\nRoss framed the moment as part of a longer shift toward emotional, rather than purely functional, branding.\n\n\"Something only has a value in the meaning attributed to it,\" he said.\n\nHe argued that collectibles work because they create what he calls \"currency of conversation,\" allowing brands to earn attention before talking about menus or pricing.\n\nAnd crucially, all three experts agreed the trend is unlikely to fade once economic conditions improve, with Moutray calling it \"one of those ongoing trends that's going to continue.\"\n\nFor restaurants navigating a squeezed middle, collectible merch has become more than a novelty. It's a way to sell belonging, buzz, and brand loyalty — one tchotchke at a time.",

    "description": "I was used to living on my own in a small town, but my new girlfriend and I decided to move to London together. I worried we'd lose our spark.",
    "fullText": "I met an incredible woman on a random outing to London while I was living life in slow motion, alone in a quiet English seaside town.\n\nI fell in love in a way that surprised me, both in its speed and its certainty. I knew it was her. The relationship unfolded across train rides, weekends, and the growing realization that what I thought was a temporary chapter in my life was quietly becoming its center.\n\nAfter a few months together, a practical question emerged. Our rent contracts were ending. Suddenly, there was an opportunity to do something that felt both thrilling and reckless: move in together and move back to London after years in a small town.\n\nIt felt risky, especially after years of living alone and so soon after meeting. But it also felt like an invitation to fully embrace a new chapter abroad, without half-measures.\n\nMy fear wasn't about commitment in the abstract. It was far more mundane and, in some ways, more unsettling: I didn't know if I actually knew how to live with someone.\n\nI had lived with my parents and sisters in Mexico, and I also had roommates during my student exchange in Spain, but that was a long time ago. Ever since leaving my country to see what life had to offer, I had lived entirely on my own.\n\nLiving alone abroad had sharpened my sense of independence. I had my routines, my rhythms, and my silence. Sharing a space meant renegotiating all of that in a city as intense as London — while also being a foreigner still figuring out where I belonged, and doing it with someone I was still getting to know.\n\nI worried about losing the version of myself I had worked hard to build over the past two years. I worried about friction, mismatched habits, and what happens when two people bring different expectations into the same kitchen, the same mornings, and the same tired evenings.\n\nStaying separate felt equally wrong, though. At some point, I had to give it a real chance.\n\nOnce we made the decision, another fear surfaced, one I hadn't said out loud at first. I worried that moving in together would flatten the magic of the relationship.\n\nDating, especially in the early stages, allows for a certain level of curation. You see each other rested, excited, and intentional. Living together removes that buffer almost immediately. There are no intermissions, no reset between interactions.\n\nI worried the romance would dissolve into logistics. That excitement would be replaced by grocery lists, chores, and bad habits. What if the softness of the early months would harden under the weight of constant proximity?\n\nIt felt like skipping too far ahead in the story. I wondered if we were rushing something that deserved more time to breathe. What if she realized I wasn't what she hoped for? What if our energies didn't align? What if it was simply too much?\n\nBut I learned that the honeymoon phase doesn't end because of shared space. It ends when curiosity stops. Living together, as it turned out, demanded more curiosity, not less.\n\nThe shift was immediate, but not in the way I expected. Living together didn't make things smaller. It made them deeper.\n\nWe learned from each other in unglamorous but essential ways: how we start our mornings, how we decompress after long days, and how we navigate stress without turning it into conflict. The relationship became less performative and more real.\n\nLiving with my girlfriend allowed me to truly know her, not just the version of her that appears on dates. I saw her patience, her habits, her quiet moments, and her resilience. I learned how she shows care when no one is watching.\n\nIn that process, I also learned more about myself. I realized that independence doesn't disappear when you share a life with someone. It evolves. Living together abroad didn't shrink my world; it expanded it.\n\nI've lived in many places and many houses, but this is the first time I can say that, with her, it feels like home.",

    "description": "The new year means new health goals, and for some, that means consuming more protein. I tried 14 high-protein drinks, and some had as much protein as a chicken breast.",
    "fullText": "Cost: $4.99 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nThe taste of the Remedy Organics Cacao Essentials Protein Shake was what I could best describe as healthy.\n\nThe date-sweetened drink is packed with plant-based ingredients, including adaptogens like ashwagandha and maca root powders as well as tapioca prebiotic powder.\n\nBut taste-wise, they weren't as sweet-treat-like as some of the other shakes. It tasted strongly of cacao, but it felt a little chalky, and seemed saltier than it did sweet.\n\nWhile I liked the drink's ingredients, I really disliked the taste. If you're looking for a plant-based, adaptogen-full drink that will also help you reach protein goals, this could be an option for you — but don't go into it expecting a sweet chocolate milk type of drink.\n\nCost: $3.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I first poured the Muscle Milk Zero Sugar shake, I noticed just how dark and thick it was. Tasting it, I found that it was way too sweet for my taste. This, combined with the thick texture, made for a pretty interesting drinking experience — I had to wash down the shake with some water to follow up the sweet taste left in my mouth.\n\nAlthough I couldn't finish drinking the small taste I'd poured myself, it also had the fewest calories and grams of sugar in the ranking, the highest fiber, and I felt like the protein payoff was great, which made the overly sweet taste feel more like a trade-off.\n\nIf you're trying to get half of your daily protein in as few calories as possible while also watching out for sugar content, this drink might be good to have on your radar … but you'll have to remind yourself of the nutrients in every sip.\n\nCost: $4.99 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nCompared to some of the other protein drinks, I found Koia's Cacao Bean protein shake to be very thin and light in color when I first poured it.\n\nIts flavor, as the name would indicate, is very cacao-bean forward. To me, it tasted exactly like cacao nibs, which can lean more nutty and earthy than chocolate-y.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Koia said the Cacao Bean protein shake is \"crafted to highlight cacao's naturally bold, slightly bitter profile rather than masking it with excessive sweetness or artificial flavoring,\" resulting in a flavor that \"may be less sweet than traditional protein shakes.\"\n\nThe almond-based, monk-fruit-sweetened drink, which isn't too sweet and packs in plant-based ingredients like rice, pea, and chickpea protein and a prebiotic blend, wasn't one of my favorites for taste, although it was fairly competitive with the other options in terms of nutrients.\n\nCost: $2.00 for 11 fluid ounces\n\nI found the flavor of the chocolate Sport Shake to be one of the most enjoyable in the ranking, and it reminded me a lot of plain chocolate milk — it was very, very sweet. I also liked that it didn't taste too much like dairy, something that bothered me with other drinks in the lineup.\n\nHowever, the drink's sweet and tasty flavor was overshadowed by its ultra-high added sugar content of 39 grams, or more than 9 teaspoons.\n\nWhile the drink has some fiber in it, coming in with 3 grams, and it was the cheapest of the ranking, I couldn't justify that much sugar. I will probably not reach for this again.\n\nCost: $2.50 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nI was shocked when I learned that Nesquik's classic chocolate milk could be considered a nutritional drink.\n\nAt 14 grams of protein, as advertised on the bottle, the drink has more grams of protein per serving than other drinks labeled as protein drinks.\n\nTasting it was just as nostalgic as expected. Compared to some of the other drinks, however, I noticed it had a stronger dairy taste and was very sweet, with a total of 18 grams of added sugar.\n\nI also noticed that the bottle recommended a portion of half a bottle, probably due to the drink's high sugar content, which would also result in half the protein intake overall.\n\nI probably wouldn't have reached for this in adulthood if not to compare it here, and I probably won't really reach for it again.\n\nCost: $5.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nLike its low-sugar version, the Muscle Milk Pro looked dark and thick. Taste-wise, the drink was sweeter than chocolate-y, and I didn't love the flavor.\n\nAlthough the drink packs an impressive 40 grams of protein in 14 ounces and 220 calories, has the highest ratio of protein to fluid ounces, and also has the highest fiber content in the list, the taste was one of my least favorites, and I had to wash it down with some water after tasting, as it had such a lingering flavor on the tongue.\n\nWhen considering the nutritional aspects of the drink, however, I felt like the taste was a solid trade-off for one of the most protein-efficient drinks in the ranking, having the second-highest amount of grams of protein in a single bottle.\n\nBut if you're strictly going for the ultra-high-protein option, the Fairlife Core Power Elite — which comes later in this ranking — might be a better bet for flavor.\n\nCost: $4.49 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I first poured the OWYN — which stands for Only What You Need — Pro Elite Protein Shake, it looked much thicker than some of the other drinks in the ranking.\n\nIt tasted vastly different from the others, too. The ingredients gave some clues as to why: The main ingredients — water, pea protein, pumpkin protein, and flaxseed oil — were completely different from the other shakes.\n\nThe plant-based, dairy-, soy-, and wheat-free drink, which contains 3 grams of prebiotics, uses monk fruit extract to sweeten its cocoa-heavy flavor, and also has a greens blend that includes spinach, kale, and broccoli.\n\nI figured that the odd flavor I experienced was perhaps due to some of its most health-forward ingredients, like the greens blend.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, OWYN said that the exclusion of artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols in the formula \"sometimes means a more natural, earthy taste profile,\" when compared to their regular shake, which uses a blend of organic cane sugar and monk fruit.\n\nUltimately, I wasn't a fan of the taste and probably wouldn't reach for this drink again, although nutrition-wise, it was a solid ultra-high-protein plant-based option.\n\nCost: $5.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nOne of three protein shakes in Fairlife's line, the Core Power Elite shake was a bit thinner than many of the other drinks I tried.\n\nIt was less sweet than Fairlife's regular chocolate milk, which I didn't mind. However, it had a much stronger dairy taste — I don't love the taste of dairy milk, so this worked against the drink for me.\n\nStill, its insane amount of protein — as much as a whole chicken breast — earned it extra points in my ranking.\n\nThis drink was something I didn't mind drinking, even if I wouldn't usually go for it. Even as a non-gym-bro, I would probably reach for this drink if I were trying to get well over half of my needed protein for the day in a single serving.\n\nCost: $2.50 for 11 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I poured the chocolate Nutrament, I noticed its consistency was among the runniest in the ranking.\n\nThe drink, the second-cheapest drink in the lineup, tasted just like chocolate milk, although it was still a bit too sweet for me.\n\nI also noticed it had a long ingredients list with many unfamiliar terms, but on closer inspection, some seemed to be added vitamins and minerals. The drink also had the second-highest added sugar content at 29 grams.\n\nThe high sugar and comparatively low protein knocked this drink down a few points for me, and although I enjoyed it, I probably wouldn't reach for this.\n\nCost: $3.29 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nThe second in Fairlife's line, its chocolate ultra-filtered milk, was another nostalgic offering.\n\nIt was very sweet, but if I were craving chocolate milk, this is definitely the option I would choose.\n\nWhile it's not marketed as a protein drink, it contains 23 grams in a 14-ounce bottle and has the second-lowest cost per gram of protein.\n\nCost: $18.99 for a six-pack of 8-ounce bottles (or $3.17 for 8 fluid ounces)\n\nWhile some of the drinks in this lineup are aimed at the ultra-protein-efficient crowd and others are more directed at children, the Boost nutritional drink line is marketed toward adults with specific nutritional needs. The Boost Plus product, specifically, is aimed at adults hoping to gain or maintain weight.\n\nTaste-wise, this was one of my favorites. The sweet and rich drink was very chocolatey, and it felt like a nice sweet treat.\n\nWith the product's purpose in mind, the drink's higher calories didn't bother me, and I was pleased to see its nutrition label flooded with vitamins and minerals.\n\nOut of many of the options, this is one I could see myself reaching for solely based on its taste, even though I wish it had a higher protein content.\n\nCost: $3.00 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I poured this drink, I was surprised by how runny it was compared to some of the other options. I really enjoyed the taste, even if it wasn't exactly the same as the nostalgic chocolate-milk flavor of Nesquik's classic option.\n\nIn fact, I actually liked this one more, even before factoring in the added nutritional value. It was adequately sweet, not too dairy-tasting, and it didn't have the aftertaste that had put me off the classic option.\n\nWith 23 grams of protein, this drink could compete with some of its more nutrition-leaning counterparts. At $3 for a bottle, it was also one of the cheapest options with the highest protein content.\n\nI could totally see myself reaching for this.\n\nCost: $4.29 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nCompared to the higher-protein drink on OWYN's line, the regular protein shake wasn't as dark or as thick when I poured it.\n\nWhile the OWYN Pro Elite had a taste I didn't like, the OWYN Dark Chocolate Protein Shake had a simpler flavor that reminded me of chocolate milk.\n\nIt was very tasty and chocolatey, and I liked that it also had 3 grams of fiber.\n\nOverall, this felt like a very solid option that I could see myself reaching for. It was also my favorite plant-based drink.\n\nCost: $4.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nWhile this drink didn't exactly feel like a dessert or chocolate milk since it leaned more chocolatey and cocoa-tasting than sweet — and it did have somewhat of a dairy taste — I still found it very enjoyable and a very nice pick for both taste and protein.\n\nTied with the Muscle Milk Zero Sugar for the lowest calories in the ranking, I found the Fairlife Core Power shake much more enjoyable and even winning by a gram in the protein category.\n\nOverall, this drink had the best balance between flavor and nutrition, and I can see myself reaching for it whenever I need a quick post-workout pick-me-up or just want to get a significant portion of my daily protein on the go.",

    "description": "Nicknamed \"Venice of America,\" Florida's Fort Lauderdale isn't quite a dupe for the Italian city, but there are great things to do if you visit.",
    "fullText": "I've lived in Miami for nearly a decade, and one of my favorite things to do is travel around Florida.\n\nOne of my go-to spots is Fort Lauderdale, a refreshing city right on the Atlantic Ocean located about 30 miles north of Miami.\n\nWith a population of about 200,000 residents, this eastern Florida city is known for its quieter beaches, walkable downtown, and vibrant stores and restaurants.\n\nIt's also famous for having hundreds of miles of canals that curl in and around the city — a feature that's earned it the nickname \"Venice of America.\" Just like in Italy's Venice, these winding waterways are very much a part of daily life in this Florida city.\n\nHowever, if your mind is now swimming with images of Italy's lagoon-encased city filled with gondolas, keep reading before you book your trip to Fort Lauderdale.\n\nIf you plan on visiting Fort Lauderdale and want to indulge in the city's Venetian spirit, I've got suggestions for popular things you can do in the city.\n\nFor one, you'll want to head downtown and make Las Olas your home base. Las Olas Boulevard is a pedestrian-friendly roadway that runs parallel to the New River, which sits a few blocks south.\n\nIt stretches all the way to the beaches, but the part closer to the US-1 highway in the west is where you'll find the most popular stores and restaurants — many of which tout their water views to guests and offer lots of outdoor seating.\n\nHere, you can set out on foot to shop along the tree-lined boulevard, grab brunch at the French-inspired Café Bastille Fort Lauderdale, or visit the Historic Stranahan House Museum by the water.\n\nThough downtown Fort Lauderdale is definitely walkable — especially compared to other parts of South Florida — you don't have to set out on foot if you don't want to.\n\nLike the vaporetto in Venice, the area offers water taxis that you can pay to ride, but I suggest the LauderGO! Water Trolley, which is free.\n\nThe trolley transports visitors along the New River in Downtown Fort Lauderdale, allowing them to travel seamlessly from one popular spot to the next.\n\nIt runs from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., traveling in a loop and stopping at popular locations along the north and south sides of the river, including Riverfront Plaza, Esplanade Park, and Tarpon River.\n\nWhen I visited Venice, one of my favorite things to do was walk along the canals early in the morning or right before dusk. The gentle lapping of the water was calming, and the views were as beautiful as what I'd seen in pictures online.\n\nIn Fort Lauderdale, you can get that same feeling by wandering along the Riverwalk, a passageway that, as the name suggests, follows the curve and flow of the New River.\n\nI enjoy walking here in the morning with a coffee in hand, unhurried, as I take in the beautiful nature of South Florida.\n\nThe city is definitely worth a visit in its own right, but picturing an Italian-style city plopped down along Florida's southeastern coast will only set you up for disappointment — and you'll miss out on all the incredible things Fort Lauderdale has to offer.\n\nAlthough the vibes in these two cities are completely different, both have some beautiful canals that are integral to the local community.\n\nFort Lauderdale is no dupe for Italy, but it's a wonderful pick if you're looking to enjoy some waterside dining and sunshine.",

    "description": "Lin Koh moved with her family from the Bay Area to the South of France to care for her mother-in-law, who has Alzheimer's. It's been a difficult transition.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lin Koh, 55, who relocated from California's Bay Area to France in 2023 with her husband and two children to help care for her mother-in-law, who has Alzheimer's. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in Singapore and moved to the US when I was young. I later settled in the Bay Area, where I met my husband, Adalbert, and had two children. Adalbert always worked in the tech industry, and before we moved to France, I spent time at Facebook and Adobe.\n\nThere are so many things to love about the Bay Area. The weather is beautiful, the food is very international, and the diversity is wonderful. But it's notoriously expensive, especially down the Peninsula and farther south.\n\nWe lived in Santa Clara, which felt more affordable for us, and we built a community we loved. Still, life there could be hard — the cost of living was high, and we were working constantly.\n\nIn 2023, we decided to move to France. We had always known we'd end up there, but what pushed us to do it then was my mother-in-law. My husband's parents live in France, and my mother-in-law has Alzheimer's. We were observing her decline, and we made the call.\n\nOur kids being young was another factor. At the time, they were five and seven, and we thought that if we delayed this any longer, it would get more difficult. I had moved around a lot when I was little, and it got tougher as I got older.\n\nI think a really big part was that we were also ready for a change. Underneath it all, we were looking for a more balanced life, where our kids could truly enjoy themselves, and we wouldn't be on our phones all the time and working.\n\nWhen you're the spouse of a French national, you're entitled to a visa called a \"vie privée et familiale\" visa — basically a private and family life visa. In that sense, the application is fairly straightforward.\n\n​​Before that, you need what France calls the \"livret de famille\" — the Family Book. It's issued when you register your marriage with the French government, and any children are added to it. It's important to have because, when you apply for the visa, they'll ask to see it to prove your family status.\n\nThe vie privée et familiale visa allows me to stay in France initially for one year and also grants me the right to work in France. That's why it's easier as a spouse — you're not subject to the restrictions you might face on a different route, like a visitor visa, where you typically wouldn't be allowed to work.\n\nWe put a lot of our things in storage. We sold a car, did a lot of purging, and had to prepare our family dog for travel. We also put our house up for rent — it's a single-family, four-bedroom home. In total, it took us six weeks to prepare everything. It was a very short timeline, because we had found a home to rent in France almost immediately.\n\nThe hardest part of leaving was saying goodbye to my family and friends — and that still stands.\n\nWe did worry about how the kids would adjust, but they're really adaptable and resilient, and they were young. They were actually excited because we positioned it as, \"Hey, this is going to be an adventure for you.\"\n\nI also think it's beneficial for kids to see their parents doing something for the good of the family. We wanted them to understand, \"Mommy and daddy are doing this because family is the most important thing.\" We really wanted to instill that value in our kids.\n\nWe live in Fuveau, near Aix-en-Provence and Aix-Marseille University. After initially renting a five-bedroom house with a pool in the small village of Saint-Savournin for about €2,200 a month, we purchased a home in Fuveau.\n\nCompared with the Bay Area, everything feels less expensive. But I will say the area we live in has a higher cost of living than a lot of other parts of France, aside from Paris.\n\nFuveau feels very Mediterranean: lots of pink hues — it's easy to see why the Impressionists loved the region. There are many stucco homes with shutters, tile roofs, terracotta, and beautiful landscaping — succulents are everywhere. We're close to the Riviera and the sea, which is just breathtaking.\n\nInitially, the kids attended a private international school, but we decided to withdraw them because they were speaking too much English. We enrolled them in public school, and within six months, both of them were fairly fluent.\n\nKids are just sponges. They now speak French to each other, even, and we sometimes have to remind them to speak English at home so they retain it. But they've adapted really well. I'd say we've been really, really lucky.\n\nSince being in France, my husband has really stepped up. It hasn't fundamentally changed our marriage, but there was initially more dependency on him because my French isn't as good as his. He had to take on a bigger role in navigating day-to-day tasks.\n\nMy husband's parents live with us. It's not easy, because my husband and I don't have as much privacy as we did before, so we really have to stay emotionally connected — expressing how we're feeling and talking things through. In some ways, it has strengthened our marriage; in other ways, it has challenged it and added new stress. But it's also brought a lot of opportunity to grow in a different direction.\n\nWith my in-laws living with us, there was a bit of an adjustment at the beginning, because we weren't used to having so many people in the house. However, once we settled in, it has been fairly smooth. We still have enough space to spread out and do our own thing.\n\nI was able to find a job here a year after we moved, and one of the wonderful things about this house is that I have my own office. My husband also has his own office space, which has been great for him.\n\nI did have to adjust when it came to responsibilities, especially preparing meals for more people. The lifestyle in France is more centered on cooking at home, rather than takeout or DoorDash.\n\nPeople visit the grocery store every other day, and fridges are often smaller. There's more emphasis on fresh food, and the markets here are amazing, which is one of my favorite things about living here. I go almost every Sunday, and the prices are really affordable.\n\nThe main goal of living with my husband's parents is to support my father-in-law, because it's really hard to support a spouse who has Alzheimer's.\n\nMy husband is an entrepreneur who has been in the software industry for many years. To help keep my mother-in-law occupied, he created an app to support her. It's called Argoli, an AI companion for the elderly. It helps occupy my mother-in-law with conversations about family and events when the rest of us aren't available. It's tough to share caregiving duties, so this helps us a lot.\n\nShe has late-stage Alzheimer's, so she needs help with day-to-day things, and she can't be left alone for too long. She shadows my father-in-law quite a bit because she recognizes him as her main caregiver.\n\nWe've also gotten help from an association in France called Petit-fils, which literally translates to \"grandson.\" Caregivers from that association come daily to spend a couple of hours with her, helping her get ready in the morning, grooming, showering, and doing other tasks. The rest of the time, we take turns as needed.\n\nOver time, we've gotten into a groove of things and know what to do and how best to help her. Sometimes she gets lost in the house, so we have to keep an eye on her. However, in the grand scheme of things, based on my experience with caregiver groups on Facebook, I feel that she's pretty manageable.\n\nThe hardest part of this move has been seeing a loved one who was so capable change over time. It's also really tough for me because my kids don't know their grandma the way she was before.\n\nBut the time together has been really good. I see how my son helps out, too — when he notices his grandma needs to drink more water, he'll go get it for her. It's really beautiful to see. It's teaching my kids how to be nurturing, and it really emphasizes the importance of family.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Sunday delivered a warning to Cuba, advising Havana to strike a deal \"before it is too late.\"\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said the island nation would no longer receive oil or money from Venezuela.\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,\" Trump wrote. \"In return, Cuba provided 'Security Services' for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!\"\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!\" he continued. \"I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.\"\n\nTrump turned his attention to Venezuela's oil industry after the US captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in Caracas last week. Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York on weapons and drug charges.\n\nOn Friday, American oil executives met with Trump and senior administration officials to discuss a proposed $100 billion plan to invest in Venezuela's oil operations.\n\nTrump earlier said the government may reimburse oil companies for growing their operations in Venezuela. The Big Oil executives at the meeting, for their part, appeared largely hesitant to reenter the volatile country before major reforms are made.\n\nFor Cuba, losing access to Venezuelan oil would be a big blow to its already uncertain economy. According to the US Energy Information Administration, Cuba imports the majority of its oil from Venezuela — about 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day, per most estimates.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last week on board Air Force One, Trump said Cuba appeared \"ready to fall.\"\n\n\"I don't know if they're going to hold out,\" he said. \"But Cuba now has no income. They got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil.\"\n\nAsked whether the US would take military action in Cuba, Trump said he did not think it would be necessary, adding: \"I think it's just going to fall.\"\n\nIn his post on Truth Social, Trump also positioned the US as Venezuela's protector moving forward, saying that most of the Cuban security personnel stationed in Caracas had been killed in the operation to seize Maduro.\n\nThe Cuban government announced that 32 of its nationals died during the US raid on the capital.",

Generally the standard is quite poor.\n\n\"A focus on throw-ins can save the life of small clubs, as a technique to survive.\n\n\"But at the top of the league, it can help with a more fluent style of play.

After earlier being denied by Gilbert's try-saving tackle, wing Melvyn Rates' try was converted by Hogg, but the former Scotland international missed from the tee after Alexis Bernadet touched down out wide with 11 minutes to play.\n\nBut there was late drama as replacement prop Welsch scored under the posts to level the game, and Hogg slotted the conversion for what would be the winning kick.\n\nConnacht still leave France with two bonus-points and victory on Saturday over US Monatuban, who are without a win in three matches, will confirm a place in the knockout stages.\n\nMontpellier: T Vincent; D Taofifenua; T Darmon, J Piccardo; M Rates; S Hogg, L Coly; B Erdorico, L Akrab, L Japaridze; F Verhaeghe, B Chalureau; M Tauleigne, A Becognee (capt), A Masibaka.\n\nReplacements: R Riccitelli, V Welsch, C Tolofua, M Uhila, L Gleeson, A Bernadet, A Vincent, J Ducros.\n\nConnacht: S Gilbert; S Jennings; H West, C Forde; F Treacy, B Murphy; B Bohan, D Tierney-Martin, S Illo; D Murray, J Murphy; C Prendergast (capt), P Boyle, S Jansen.\n\nReplacements: M Victory, P Dooley, F Barrett, N Murray, S O'Brien, A Lindner, S Walsh, J Devine.",

    "description": "Sergey Brin is joining his Google co-founder, Larry Page, in reducing ties to the state where they built their fortunes.",
    "fullText": "For nearly three decades, Google has been steeped in the lore of Silicon Valley.\n\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford University graduate students, created the search engine in 1998 and built the start-up out of a friend’s garage in Menlo Park, Calif. Over time, Google became a nearly $4 trillion juggernaut, helping to cement the Northern California region as the global epicenter of the internet industry.\n\nNow, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page are cutting some ties with the state where they made their fortunes.\n\nIn the 10 days before Christmas, an entity connected to Mr. Brin, 52, terminated or moved 15 California limited liability companies that oversee some of his business interests and investments out of the state, according to documents seen by The New York Times. Seven of the companies — including those that appear to manage one of Mr. Brin’s superyachts and his interest in a private air terminal at San Jose’s international airport — were converted into Nevada entities.\n\nMr. Brin is joining Mr. Page, 52, in reducing his California presence. More than 45 California limited liability companies associated with Mr. Page filed documents last month to either become inactive or move out of the state, according to state records. A trust with ties to Mr. Page also purchased a $71.9 million mansion in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood this week, according to a deed seen by The Times.\n\nAnother entity jointly managed by Mr. Brin and Mr. Page moved out of California and to Nevada on Christmas Eve, according to a filing seen by The Times.\n\nThe Google founders’ shrinking connections to California underscore the impact of a potential ballot measure that would affect the state’s wealthiest residents. Proposed by a health care union, the measure calls for Californians worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax that would be equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. If the measure gains enough signatures to reach the state ballot in November and wins approval, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of Jan. 1 and they would have five years to pay it.\n\nThe potential wealth tax has already caused some California billionaires to establish more ties outside the state. Last month, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment firm in Miami. David Sacks, the tech investor and White House adviser on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.\n\nBut the actions of Mr. Brin and Mr. Page stand out because of their wealth — their combined net worths total more than $518 billion, as estimated by Forbes — and how closely identified they are with California. While both stepped down from day-to-day management of Google and its parent, Alphabet, in 2019, they remain on the board of the company and Mr. Brin has recently become more active in Google’s A.I. efforts.\n\nMr. Brin and Mr. Page still have connections to California, including homes across the state. It’s unclear how much time they will be spending in the state this year.\n\nA representative for Mr. Brin declined to comment. Google and representatives for Mr. Page did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on Mr. Page’s Miami home purchase and Business Insider reported on some details of the shifting of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin’s companies.\n\nThe ballot initiative, which was proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system, has elicited a broad spectrum of reactions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has called the measure bad policy, arguing that it will lead billionaires to simply move to tax-friendlier states. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has defended the initiative, drawing criticism from tech investors and entrepreneurs who are discussing funding a challenger to his seat.\n\nOthers have said the proposed tax could drive entrepreneurs and investors out of California, which could then stifle innovation. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and a Silicon Valley resident, said the measure was a “horrendous idea” that might force founders and executives to sell shares in companies that they run simply to fulfill the tax obligation.\n\n“Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,” Mr. Hoffman posted on social media on Wednesday. Mr. Hoffman’s spokeswoman said he was not available for comment.\n\nJensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia and one of California’s wealthiest men, was among the few billionaires who publicly said they accepted the wealth tax. “We chose to live in Silicon Valley and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, adding that he was “perfectly fine” with it.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn a statement, Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff at Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, said an exodus of billionaires from California was overblown.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of billionaires have chosen to stay in California past the Jan. 1 deadline,” she said. “Only a very small percentage left before the deadline, despite weeks of Chicken Little talking points claiming a modest tax would trigger a mass departure.”\n\nKirsten Noyes and Georgia Gee contributed research.",

    "description": ": No naming that tune and no album covers",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is celebrating the resurgence of interest in physical media in the only way it knows how… by halting the Windows Media Player metadata service.\n\nReaders of a certain vintage will remember inserting a CD into their PC and watching Windows Media Player populate with track listings and album artwork. No more. Sometime before Christmas, the metadata servers stopped working and on Windows 10 or 11, the result is the same: album not found.\n\nWe tried this out at Vulture Central on some sacrificial Windows devices that had media drives and can confirm that a variety of compact discs were met with stony indifference. Some 90s cheese that was successfully ripped (for personal use, of course) decades ago? No longer recognized. A reissue of something achingly hip? Also not recognized.\n\nWindows Media Player - guess the album - Click to enlarge\n\nWe asked Microsoft if the service had indeed been retired or if there might be a reprieve or workaround, but we were met with equal indifference from the tech giant's PR organ.\n\nA message on a Reddit forum purporting to be a chat with a Microsoft support representative suggested that the servers have indeed been shut down, and that a third-party alternative should be sourced.\n\nAlternatively, customers can manually enter the information, like it's the 1990s all over again.\n\nThe timing is unfortunate. Tired of content vanishing from streaming services or disappearing into algorithmic feeds, consumers are returning to physical media like CDs.\n\nPhysical media drives have yet to completely disappear from Windows devices, but the default service used by Windows Media Player for album information, musicmatch-ssl.xboxlive.com, does not appear to serve up any metadata.\n\nWindows Media Player has a long history with Windows. First released as part of the Multimedia Extensions for Windows 3.0, it evolved over the years, gaining support for streaming, ripping, and burning CDs. It survived Microsoft's Zune experiment and remains in Windows 11 - though now branded \"Legacy\" as Microsoft pushes users toward its modern Media Player app.\n\nMicrosoft does not share its device telemetry, but it clearly concluded too few users still play CDs to justify maintaining the metadata services.\n\nApple's iTunes, on the other hand, recognized every CD we threw at it. ®",

The England forward found himself on the left wing, kicked it ahead and gathered to run in and score before shushing the booing from the stands.\n\nSaints then struggled at the scrum, with prop Danilo Fischetti being sin-binned, and they fell behind when a man down as Rayasi swapped passes with Damian Penaud to score.\n\nNorthampton went down to 13 men when flying winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey was taken out late by Rory Hutchinson and were still a man short when scrum-half Martin Page-Relo sniped through a gap in the stretched defence to score a sparkling third.\n\nPenaud put Woki in to score a bonus point before the break and Rayasi completed a world-class hat-trick early in the second half with a ridiculous run from his own half, weaving and leaving Saints defenders in his wake.\n\nWoki intercepted a pass to run in and score a second, before Tommy Freeman cut the lead with a fine finish after some concerted pressure.\n\nBordeaux again scored with ease though, Woki pocketing the loose ball from the restart to run in for his third before fly-half Matthieu Jalibert sprinted clear to bring up the 50 points on the hour mark.\n\nSaints kept going, as Pollock scored a second fine try from a kick from Hutchinson in the closing stages and Fischetti stretched out to secure a potentially vital bonus point.\n\nNorthampton are through to the last 16 already but may now face another testing trip away from home.\n\nBordeaux: Rayasi; Penaud, Depoortere, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Page-Relo; Poirot, Lamothe (capt), Sadie, Coleman, Cazeaux, Du Preez, Woki, Matiu.\n\nReplacements: Barlot, Perchaud, Tameifuna, Palu, Vergnes-Taillefer, Retiere, Carbery, Janse van Rensburg.\n\nNorthampton: Hendy; Sleightholme, Freeman, Hutchinson, Todaro; Belleau, Mitchell; Fischetti, Wright, Davison, Coles, Van der Mescht, Chick (capt), Pearson, Pollock.\n\nReplacements: Smith, Iyogun, Millar-Mills, Prowse, Munga, Graham, McParland, Thame.\n\nSin-bin: Fischetti (17 mins), Hutchinson (26 mins)",

I mean, not lucky because we worked really hard,\" said Swiatek about Poland's win, following defeats by Germany and the United States in the 2024 and 2025 finals.\n\n\"I want to thank our team because this year I felt like it was such a team effort. I really felt the support. Even though my singles performance wasn't perfect, you really got my spirits up and each of you believed to the end.\"\n\nIt looked as though Poland might lose a third consecutive final when Bencic continued her winning singles record at the United Cup with her ninth victory, beating Swiatek to give Switzerland the lead in their first final.\n\nBut Hurkacz wrestled Poland back into the tie, maintaining his own fine form after returning to competition following seven months out injured, beating 40-year-old Warwinka in his final season on the tour.\n\nThen Kawa and Zielinski proved too strong for Bencic and Paul, showing the form that helped them win a deciding rubber against the American pairing of Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison in the semi-finals, as they claimed a fifth successive win in the tournament to clinch the title for Poland.",

    "title": "6 Lean Proteins That Will Help You Burn Fat Instead Of Storing It",
    "description": "Discover 6 lean proteins that can help burn fat, only on SheFinds.com",
    "fullText": "If you’re looking to lose weight, stabilize blood sugar, and keep hunger at bay, adding the right proteins to your diet can make all the difference. Lean proteins not only help preserve muscle mass but also support metabolism and improve satiety, making it easier to burn fat rather than store it. We asked registered dietitians and health experts to share the best lean proteins that can help you achieve these goals.\n\nQuinoa contains all nine essential amino acids, making it a rare plant-based complete protein. Protein takes more energy to digest (thermic effect of food) and helps preserve lean muscle. Since muscle burns more calories at rest, eating quinoa supports a higher metabolic rate, encouraging your body to burn fat rather than store it.\n\n\"Quinoa contains antioxidant phytochemicals and is high in vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber. A study by Harvard Public School of Health found that eating a bowl of quinoa daily may reduce the chances of early death risk from cancer, heart disease, respiratory ailments, diabetes, and other chronic diseases by 17 percent,\" Dr. Ellen Albertson, PhD, RDN, NBC-HWC highlights.\n\nIncorporating these lean proteins into your meals can help you feel full, maintain energy, and keep blood sugar levels steady—all of which contribute to fat burning instead of storage. Pairing them with fiber-rich vegetables, healthy fats, and whole grains can amplify their benefits, making it easier to reach your health and weight goals in 2026.\n\nTurkey is packed with high-quality, lean protein. Protein requires more energy to digest (thermic effect of food) than carbs or fat, meaning your body burns more calories processing it. Protein also preserves lean muscle mass, which boosts your resting metabolic rate—muscle burns more calories than fat, even at rest.\n\n\"Turkey is a good source of vitamins B6 and B12, which play crucial roles in energy production, metabolism, and nervous system health,\" Elizabeth Keller, nutritionist for Well Choices lists, noting that this can be especially helpful for people over 40 as \"these vitamins become even more important for maintaining vitality and cognitive function\" with age.\n\nLegumes (like lentils, chickpeas, and black beans) are high in fiber and have a low glycemic index. This means they release glucose into your bloodstream slowly, preventing sharp blood sugar spikes. When blood sugar stays stable, insulin levels remain moderate. Since insulin is a hormone that signals the body to store fat, keeping it steady encourages your body to burn fat instead.\n\n\"Lean protein sources like legumes can stabilize blood sugar by slowing down gastric emptying and reducing the overall glycemic impact of a meal,\" Nanavati says. She adds, \"Protein keeps you fuller for longer, potentially minimizing unnecessary snacking and calorie intake, which can influence blood sugar levels.\"\n\nWild-caught fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation—both key for stable blood sugar.\n\n\"We all know that salmon is high in fat, but the omega-3 fatty acids found in it are one of the healthiest fats we can eat. Plus, both fat and protein are key nutrients for weight loss. They keep us satiated for longer, so you don’t end up overeating during the day,\" Eva De Angelis, a registered dietitian, nutritionist, and writer at Healthcanal.com says.\n\nEggs are packed with high-quality protein, which slows the absorption of carbohydrates and helps stabilize blood sugar levels. This can reduce insulin spikes and keep energy steady throughout the day.\n\n\"The best high-protein breakfast for fat loss is eggs,\" nutrition expert Dr. Matt Chalmers tells us. \"Whether your goal is to increase muscle mass, which also increases metabolism, or just burn fat, eggs should be a major part of your diet.\"\n\nGreek yogurt has a lower glycemic index than many other dairy products and sugary snacks, meaning it causes a slower, more gradual rise in blood sugar. This can help prevent sharp spikes and crashes that affect energy and appetite.\n\n\"Greek yogurt has higher protein than regular yogurt, which can improve blood sugar control and reduce appetite. It's essential to choose plain, unsweetened varieties to minimize added sugars affecting blood sugar levels,\" Krutika Nanavati, RDN, tells us.",

It's definitely a great achievement for myself - my first time playing at the Masters and the first time beating Shaun Murphy.\"\n\nFor 43-year-old Murphy, who reached the semi-final of the UK Championship last month, it was a disappointing afternoon with him failing to register a single break of 50.\n\n\"I've been looking forward to today for a year, walking out as champion, but I enjoyed the first 10 minutes,\" said Murphy. \"I didn't play well, certainly the worst performance of my season, maybe the worst in the Masters.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed. None of it was there. I felt everything I touched was not there. I've been working very hard, practising hard, playing a lot of snooker, so I didn't expect to play like that and I'm as shocked as anyone.\n\n\"Wu looked calm, looked at ease and fully deserved his win. He will be a handful for anyone he plays.\"",

    "fullText": "TASIILAQ, GREENLAND — Oil executives looking for the next massive source of petroleum have turned toward the Arctic for decades. Studies by the US government suggest the area above the Arctic Circle could hold as many as 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe oil alone would be enough to sustain the entirety of global demand for nearly three years if all other drilling worldwide were to cease tomorrow.\n\nAt the center of these ambitions is Greenland, where some of the harshest conditions on Earth protect stores that have drawn in prospectors looking for the chance at another discovery the size of Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay.\n\nA company called March GL, which will be renamed Greenland Energy Company after it goes public this year, is hoping to vault itself into the upper echelons of the industry by extracting some of these billions of barrels of oil from a peninsula called Jameson Land sticking off the eastern coast of Greenland, the largest island in the world. The oil could be transformative for the US and European markets likely to receive it, injecting a massive wave of new supply that could help wean Europe from its dependence on Russian petroleum, currently under a steep sanctions regime as its war in Ukraine rages on.\n\nIn late October, Yahoo Finance accompanied March GL CEO and veteran oilman Robert Price, alongside the company’s lead petroleum engineer, to a town called Tasiilaq on Greenland’s eastern coast, where March GL’s contractors were preparing to store a collection of heavy machinery in town for the winter.\n\nPrice had been planning to barge the earthmovers up to Jameson Land, where they would begin constructing a three-mile-long road from the coast to the inland site where March GL will be drilling its first wells. Rough seas off the island’s eastern coast left the tugboat with which the company planned to haul the equipment unable to make the journey; by late autumn, the window of ice-free water to make this trip was closing too quickly to wait for a new one.\n\nInstead, March GL’s team will keep much of its equipment in Tasiilaq until the spring or summer, when the ice will thaw, compressing their timelines — a testament to the tenuous-at-best operating conditions in Greenland.\n\nSince that trip, the complexities of Price’s Greenland ambitions have only increased.\n\nAfter the arrest and extraction of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in early January, President Trump renewed his push to annex the Danish autonomous territory. Trump said during a press briefing on Jan. 4 that “we need Greenland” to protect US national security interests in the Arctic, comments which set off a wave of pushback from the Greenlandic and Danish governments.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will urge Group of Seven nations and others to step up their efforts to reduce reliance on critical minerals from China when he hosts a dozen top finance ​officials on Monday, a senior U.S. official said.\n\nThe meeting, which kicks off with a dinner on Sunday evening, will include ‌finance ministers or cabinet ministers from the G7 advanced economies, the European Union, Australia, India, South Korea and Mexico, said the official who was not authorized to speak ‌publicly.\n\nTogether, the grouping accounts for 60% of global demand for critical minerals.\n\n\"Urgency is the theme of the day. It's a very big undertaking. There's a lot of different angles, a lot of different countries involved and we really just need to move faster,\" the official said.\n\nBessent on Friday told Reuters that he had been pressing for a separate meeting on the issue since a G7 leaders summit in Canada in June, where he ⁠delivered a rare earths presentation to gathered heads ‌of state from the U.S., Britain, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the European Union.\n\nLeaders agreed to an action plan at the summit to secure their supply chains and boost their economies, but Bessent has grown ‍frustrated about the lack of urgency demonstrated by attendees, the official said.\n\nAside from Japan, which took action after China abruptly cut off its critical minerals supplies in 2010, G7 members remain heavily dependent on critical minerals from China, which has threatened to impose strict export controls.\n\nChina dominates the critical minerals supply chain, ​refining between 47% and 87% of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. These minerals are used ‌in defense technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.\n\nThe U.S. is expected to issue a statement after the meeting, but no specific joint action is likely, the official added.\n\n“The United States is in the posture of calling everyone together, showing leadership, sharing what we have in mind going forward,\" said the official. \"We're ready to move with those who feel a similar level of urgency ... and others can join as they come to the realization of how serious this is.\"\n\nThe official gave no details on what ⁠further steps were planned by the Trump administration, which is pushing forward to ​boost domestic production and reduce reliance on China through agreements with Australia, Ukraine and ​other producers.",

    "description": "\"My mate said his 13-year-old daughter was the only one in her 20-plus friend group to get banned from Snapchat. It took them one day to find a workaround.\"",
    "fullText": "The ban took effect on December 10, 2025, with several other countries watching closely as they consider similar moves. Malaysia, in particular, plans to introduce a comparable ban this year, while Denmark, Norway, France, Spain, and New Zealand are all weighing their own restrictions on teen social media use. Officials from Canada, the UK, and Japan have also been in talks with Australian lawmakers about similar legislation.\n\nNone of the methods is foolproof. Facial age scans can misjudge users by several years, shared family devices can complicate account-based checks, and requiring identification raises privacy concerns, particularly for minors and vulnerable users. As a result, the experience of the ban can vary widely depending on the platform, the device, and the verification method used.\n\n•  Who Got Kicked Off — And Who Didn't\n\n•  Who Else Got Caught In The Crossfire\n\nThe ban's enforcement was wildly inconsistent. Some kids lost access immediately, others never noticed a change, and a few got caught in the system by mistake.\n\nFor the kids who did get locked out, workarounds surfaced almost immediately.\n\nMeanwhile, parents who'd been using built-in safety tools found those features had quietly disappeared.\n\nThe ban also swept up people it was never meant to target — including adults and at-risk teens who depended on online communities.\n\nGiven all that, it might seem surprising that many supporters remain optimistic. But they're not looking at what happened in the first month — they're betting on what won't happen in the next five years.\n\nAlso in Parents: \"My 'Pullout Method' Turns Three In November\": 31 Moms Who Were Hilariously Heartwarming Online\n\nAlso in Parents: 43 Vile, Monstrous, Unhinged, Boundary-Crossing In-Laws Who Need To Be Put In Their Place Right Now\n\nAlso in Parents: People Are Confessing The \"Normal\" Things Their Parents Did Without Realizing How Much It Hurt Them, And It's So Sadly Relatable",

    "fullText": "Swedish producer is trying to to accelerate the process of extracting the elements vital for hi-tech products\n\nIt is deep winter with temperatures dropping to -20C. The sun never rises above the horizon, instead bathing Sweden’s most northerly town of Kiruna in a blue crepuscular light, or “civil twilight” as it is known, for two or three hours a day stretching visibility a few metres, notwithstanding heavy snow.\n\nBut 900 metres below the arctic conditions, a team of 20 gather every day, forgoing the brief glimpse of natural light and spearheading the EU’s race to mine its own rare earths. Despite identification of several deposits around the continent, and some rare earth refineries including Solvay in France, there are no operational rare earth mines in Europe.\n\nAcross the globe, the scramble for rare earths has become the source of huge geopolitical tension, with China accused last year by the EU of “weaponising” its near monopoly on raw materials and end products, essential for everything from smartphones, to electric cars, to fridges, music speakers and military jets.\n\nChina’s willingness to slap export bans on rare earths led to the vicious trade war with Donald Trump last year and is partly driving his current bid to take over Greenland, which is rich in these materials, now among the most precious in the world.\n\nEvery day the team at LKAB mine in Kiruna drive 4km (2.5 miles) down an impressive network of tunnels to get closer to what is known as the Per Geijer deposit of magnetite-hematite-phosphate named after the Swedish geologist who identified it more than 100 years ago.\n\nThe team are now operating at two levels – 900m and 1.3km deep underground as they try to connect the existing vast iron ore mine in Kiruna with Per Geijer about 2km away.\n\nUsing remote technology they drill a fan of 84 holes in the rock face; pump them with explosives which are then blasted between 1.15am and 1.45am every night, sometimes disturbing the inhabitants overground, and causing subsidence that has led to the state-owned compamy moving parts of the town and its church.\n\nLess than four hours later the team are back.\n\n“At 5am in the morning, when we have ventilated out the blasting fumes, we start the mucking out,” says 37-year-old Kiruna native Jim Lidström, who leads the tunnelling to what is one of Europe’s largest deposits of rare earths.\n\nOnce cleared, a separate team of men and women, sitting in a modern console centre 1.3k below ground, “scale” the rock, remotely controlling machines that break the detritus into transportable chunks for onward transport to a driverless train.\n\nLidström’s team then set about making the tunnel stable and usable, drilling bolts into the freshly made walls and then spraying it with a layer of concrete or “shotcrete” before the whole process starts all over again.\n\n“We do about five metres a day,” Lidström says.\n\nThe hunt for rare earths is slow.\n\nThe 17 rare earth elements – all found in Kiruna – include neodymium and praseodymium, critical materials for the powerful permanent magnets needed for everything from electric cars to household appliances and military jets.\n\nAlthough geological surveys show large ore bodies across the west – including the Fen complex in Norway, thought to be Europe’s largest deposit – from mine to refined end production could take 10 to 15 years, say experts.\n\n“I think people often miss the point. They say ‘why don’t we just produce rare earths in Europe?’. But you have to have the entire supply chain to do that,” says Nigel Steward, a professor at Imperial College London, a materials scientist and a former executive in the US mining industry.\n\nThe experience in Kiruna shows just how challenging it is to reduce the EU’s dependency on China, which is now the core supplier of rare earth magnets and willing to choke supplies, as it did last year, if politically desirable.\n\nState-owned LKAB is now trying to accelerate the process of mining, extraction, and separation of the crumbs from the ore, to help the EU de-risk as quickly as possible.\n\nJan Moström, the chief executive of LKAB, explains that it could take “years and years” if the company tried to expose the entire length of the Per Geijer deposit for mining purposes.\n\n“But that is not what we are going to do. What we are going to do is to open up incrementally,” he says.\n\nHe refuses to give a timeline because of its sensitivity, instead explaining the complex task ahead in the vast network of tunnels circling the deposit.\n\n“The main focus for us now in the Kiruna system is to find a mine design to deal with the mining of the present reserves down to the main level, at 1,365 metres , then to work out how we go beneath that and develop that resource into reserves, and also how to connect the Per Geijer deposit into the [existing iron ore mining] system. We will start to develop it incrementally, and that is the huge difference [from previous approaches],” he says.\n\nFor Moström, who has spent his career in mines, the last 11 with LKAB, the stranglehold Beijing has built in rare earths was no accident, and something he has been pressing home in Brussels repeatedly.\n\nAs the US and Europe started to regulate against toxic waste in the 1980s, China which had none of the environmental concerns, ploughed on charring the landscape as it went building a chokehold on raw materials now critical for modern life.\n\n“I’ve been talking in Brussels the past two or three years about the huge disadvantages we created in the 1970s and the 1980s when we closed the mining industry and started importing metals from South America, Africa, Australia,” he says.\n\nAsked why it has taken the EU so long to wake up to the dangers of dependency on China’s rare earth supply, he is blunt: “Politicians will never be more courageous than the voters.”\n\n“Nobody saw any future in mining, then the super-cycle started and China started to consume enormous volumes of metals,” he says referring to the boom at the turn of the century when China drove a huge commodities boom on the back of urbanisation.\n\n“I have the perception that the European Commission, the commissioners, really understand the importance of domestic mining and some sort of self-sufficiency,” Moström says.\n\nAs part of the acceleration efforts, LKAB has put €80m (£69m) into a new “demonstration” plant in nearby Luleå to test the process of separation before mining even begins. It has also taken a stake in the Norwegian company REEtec to develop an environmentally friendly way of refining the extract.\n\nContrary to what the name suggests, rare earths – a group of 17 soft metals with unique properties such as strong magnetismor high temperature resistance – are not rare.\n\nSpeckled like crumbs in the earth’s crust, the tag “rare” stuck because of the difficulty accessing them, mining them, and separating them from the ore in which they are found, a process that can take a decade.\n\nLKAB has already been visited by a line of Brussels dignitaries, including industry commissioner Stéphane Séjourné in September, because is represents the EU’s best current hope of weaning itself of a dependency on Chinese supplies that has left Europe vulnerable to increasing geopolitical tensions.\n\nDespite the rhetoric in Brussels, London and Washington over the need to wean industries off China, Beijing will hold the rare earth cards for years to come.\n\n“Right now China controls 85% of the final processing of light rare earths and it control 100% of the heavy rare earths,” says Darren Wilson, the chief executive of LKAB’s industrial minerals division.\n\nAccording to senior European Commission officials in December the EU uses 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets, a year of which 17,000 to 18,000 come from China, creating an unbalanced and high-risk trade relationship.\n\nLast April, in retaliation against Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, China imposed global export restrictions on rare earths, hitting Europe’s car industry. It threatened to impose more restrictions in October, until a 12-month truce was agreed with Trump at in Korea the same month.\n\nAs George Riddell, a senior adviser at Flint Global and a trade expert, says: “China has not just got the capacity to weaponise its trade but shown it has the willingness to do so.”\n\nAll hopes rest on LKAB now being the first to reduce the EU’s reliance on China, with a pre-existing highly developed mining operation employing about 2,000 workers directly and double that indirectly.\n\nMagnetic properties of some metals were discovered by the Greeks 4,000 years ago.\n\nPermanent magnets, found in speakers, headphones, toys, cars and military equipment are typically manufactured from a neodymium-iron-boron alloy.\n\nThe process begins by melting suitable raw materials, placing them into a mould that is then chilled, resulting in a powder. All the particles have then to align in the right direction to create a powerful magnetic force. The powder is sintered in a furnace, bonding the particles together into a mass that is then cut for final use.\n\nPermanent magnets were developed in the research department of the General Motors Company in the US and by the Japanese materials scientist Masato Sagawa in the 1980s.\n\nBut making these powerful magnets generates radioactive byproducts that can contaminate water and soil.\n\nAs the west introduced environmental regulations in the 1980s, US rare earth suppliers “started exporting their product to China because they were willing to process it,” says Imperial College London’s Steward.\n\nGM is now working with Mountain Pass, the only operational rare earth mine in the US, which is thought to be about two years away from producing products for the American market.\n\n“There is no reason why we can’t remake magnets. They were our inventions, in the west. That is the crazy thing,” Steward says.",

    "fullText": "FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) — A Virginia man who had a relationship with a Brazilian au pair is going to trial Monday in what prosecutors say was an elaborate double-murder scheme to frame another man in the stabbing of his wife.\n\nBrendan Banfield is charged with aggravated murder in the February 2023 killings of Christine Banfield and Joseph Ryan at the Banfields' home in northern Virginia. He has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nBanfield and Juliana Peres Magalhães, the family’s au pair, were with the wife and Ryan on the morning the victims were killed in the primary bedroom of the Banfield home, court records say. Authorities have said on that day, Banfield and Magalhães told officials they saw Ryan, a stranger, stabbing the wife after he entered the house. Then they each shot the intruder, Banfield and Magalhães said at the time.\n\nProsecutors have painted a different picture, arguing that Brendan Banfield and Magalhães lured Ryan to the house and staged it to look like he and the au pair shot a predator in defense. Officials have said Banfield and Magalhães had a romantic affair beginning the year before the killings.\n\nBoth the au pair and husband were arrested between 2023 and 2024 and initially handed murder charges in the case. In 2024, Magalhães pleaded guilty to a downgraded manslaughter charge after giving a statement to officials confirming parts of their theory.\n\nIn that statement, Magalhães said she and Brendan Banfield created an account in his wife’s name on a social media platform for people interested in sexual fetishes. There, Ryan connected with the account in Christine Banfield’s name, and the users made plans to meet on the morning of Feb. 24, 2023, for a sexual encounter that would involve a knife, authorities said based on the statement from Magalhães.\n\nProsecutor Eric Clingan said last year that the au pair's statement helped the state solidify its theory ahead of trial.\n\n“With 12 different homicide detectives, there were 24 different theories,” Clingan said. “Now, one theory.”\n\nNot all officials investigating the case have believed Banfield and Magalhães catfished Ryan.\n\nBrendan Miller, a former digital forensic examiner with the Fairfax County Police Department, testified last year that he analyzed dozens of devices and concluded Christine Banfield had connected with Ryan herself through the social networking platform.\n\nAn evidence analysis team at the University of Alabama peer-reviewed and affirmed Miller’s digital forensic findings, according to evidence submitted to the court.\n\nMiller was transferred out of the department’s digital forensics unit in late 2024, though a former Fairfax County commander testified the reassignment was not punitive or disciplinary.\n\nJohn Carroll, Banfield's attorney, argued that Millers' transfer was directly tethered to the case. He also said in court that Fairfax County police reassigned the case’s lead detective after that man had pushed back on the top brass’ catfishing theory.\n\n“It is a theory in search of facts rather than a series of facts supporting a theory,” Carroll said.\n\nBanfield, whose daughter was at the house on the morning of the killings, is also charged with child abuse and felony child cruelty in connection with the case. He will also face those charges during the aggravated murder trial.",

    "description": "U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA/HOUSTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said no more Venezuelan oil or money will go to Cuba and suggested the Communist-run island should strike a deal with Washington, ramping up pressure on the long-time U.S. nemesis and provoking defiant words from the island's leadership.\n\nVenezuela is ​Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but no cargoes have departed from Venezuelan ports to the Caribbean country since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. forces ‌in early January amid a strict U.S. oil blockade on the OPEC country, shipping data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Caracas and Washington are progressing on a $2 billion deal to supply up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. with ‌proceeds to be deposited in U.S. Treasury-supervised accounts, a major test of the emerging relationship between Trump and interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,\" Trump added.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel rejected Trump's threat on social media, suggesting the U.S. had no moral authority to force a deal on Cuba.\n\n\"Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Nobody dictates what ⁠we do,\" Diaz-Canel said on X. \"Cuba does not attack; it has ‌been attacked by the U.S. for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.\"\n\nThe U.S. president did not elaborate on his suggested deal.\n\nBut Trump's push on Cuba represents the latest escalation in his move to bring regional ‍powers in line with the United States and underscores the seriousness of the administration's ambition to dominate the Western Hemisphere.\n\nTrump's top officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have made no secret of their expectation that the recent U.S. intervention in Venezuela could push Cuba over the edge.\n\nU.S. officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks, though the two countries have been at odds since former leader Fidel Castro's ​1959 revolution.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in another post on X on Sunday that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to ‌export it. He also denied that Cuba had received financial or other \"material\" compensation in return for security services provided to any country.\n\nThirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. raid on Venezuela. Cuba said those killed were responsible for \"security and defense\" but did not provide details on the arrangement between the two long-time allies.\n\nCuba relies on imported crude and fuel mainly provided by Venezuela, and Mexico in smaller volumes, purchased on the open market to keep its power generators and vehicles running.\n\nAs its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela's supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider with some 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship ⁠tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA, which covered roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit.\n\nEven before Maduro's ​capture, Cuba had been struggling to keep the lights on. Vast swaths of the island live without electricity for ​much of the day, and even the capital Havana has seen its economy crippled by hours-long rolling blackouts.\n\nShortages of food, fuel and medicine have put Cubans on edge and have prompted a record-breaking exodus, primarily to the United States, in the past five years.\n\nMexico has emerged in recent ‍weeks as a critical alternative oil supplier to ⁠the island, but the supply remains small, according to the shipping data.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week said her country had not increased supply volumes, but given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an \"important supplier\" of crude to Cuba.\n\nU.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political situation, but its assessments offer ⁠no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is \"ready to fall,\" Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.\n\nThe CIA's view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and ‌tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela could make governing ‌more difficult for Diaz-Canel.",

    "description": "Could a turmeric supplement be the missing piece to your wellness puzzle, or is it just another health trend?",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia\n\nTurmeric may help reduce inflammation and joint pain, and it may support heart and gut health.\n\nSafe intake of turmeric supplements is considered up to 8 g, but long-term effects are unknown.\n\nPossible side effects include nausea, diarrhea, liver injury and medication interactions.\n\nIf you’re exploring ways to spice up your wellness routine, chances are turmeric supplements have caught your attention. Praised for their ability to stamp out inflammation, these golden capsules have become popular among those seeking natural ways to support their health. Turmeric supplements are often formulated with enhanced absorption and a higher concentration of potent compounds than what you’d find in the spice you’d typically use in cooking. But do they really live up to their claims?\n\nWe spoke with registered dietitians to break down the benefits, potential risks and what you should know before adding turmeric supplements to your daily regimen.\n\nTurmeric is a golden-yellow spice that comes from the root of the Curcuma longa plant, native to Southeast Asia. With its distinctively warm and earthy flavor, turmeric has been used as a culinary spice and traditional medicine for thousands of years.\n\nIt’s particularly valued for its beneficial compounds. Most notably, turmeric contains active compounds called curcuminoids that have been isolated and studied for their positive effects on the body, says Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RD, a registered dietitian. Within the class of curcuminoids, curcumin is commonly promoted as a beneficial supplement for a myriad of health conditions, as outlined below.\n\nWhile short-term inflammation is a natural and necessary part of the body’s healing process, prolonged inflammation (aka chronic inflammation) can contribute to the onset of chronic conditions. Among natural remedies, turmeric is widely recognized for its ability to combat inflammation. “Its active compound, curcumin, is the driving force behind its anti-inflammatory effects,” says Emily Niswanger, M.S., RDN, a functional registered dietitian. Curcumin supplements have been shown to reduce inflammation by suppressing the pathways that lead to an inflammatory response, Niswanger explains. She adds that curcumin also functions as an antioxidant, helping to clear free radicals from the body that damage healthy cells and tissues.\n\nTurmeric’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have also been shown to alleviate joint pain. “Curcumin can reduce joint pain and stiffness by inhibiting inflammatory pathways, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which are often overactive in arthritis,” says Erin Kenney, M.S., RDN, a registered dietitian. She emphasizes that studies have shown that turmeric supplementation can be as effective as some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in relieving osteoarthritis symptoms without the associated side effects, such as indigestion, constipation, drowsiness and dizziness. However, more high-quality research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and determine the optimal dosage for relieving joint pain.\n\nThe curcumin in this golden spice may even boost your heart health. “Curcumin helps reduce systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and LDL cholesterol oxidation, all of which contribute to heart disease,” says Kenney. She highlights that it also improves endothelial function, which supports healthy blood vessel function and circulation. Some research suggests that turmeric supplements may help lower systolic blood pressure when taken for more than 12 weeks. However, no impact has been observed for diastolic blood pressure, says Niswanger. As a reference, systolic blood pressure is the upper number in your blood pressure measurement, whereas diastolic blood pressure is the lower number. While these findings are encouraging, additional research is needed to fully understand the long-term impact of turmeric supplements on heart health.\n\nThe benefits of turmeric supplements may also extend to the gut. “Due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, curcumin can help reduce inflammation in the gut, potentially benefiting conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),” says Kenney. She explains that curcumin may also promote a balanced gut microbiome by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria and reducing harmful ones. Additionally, she notes that it may support bile production, which is required for fat digestion and overall digestive health.\n\nPendleton says protecting the brain from inflammation and oxidative damage is crucial for maintaining cognitive function, as both are closely linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Curcumin has shown potential in several studies for reducing these harmful processes and improving cognitive outcomes in people with Alzheimer’s disease. However, Pendleton highlights that, while these results are promising, more long-term human studies are needed to fully assess turmeric’s impact on chronic neurological conditions.\n\nWhile curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, is generally safe at doses up to 8 grams, it does come with risks. Kenney notes that some individuals may experience common gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, diarrhea and bloating. Additionally, turmeric supplements may interfere with iron absorption, particularly affecting those with iron-deficiency anemia, explains Pendleton.\n\nRare but serious side effects, such as liver injury, have been reported in case studies involving high-potency curcumin supplements, says Niswanger. Fortunately, symptoms of liver toxicity typically resolve once supplementation is discontinued. Kidney issues, including an increased risk of kidney stones, have also been linked to turmeric supplements.\n\nThe lack of standardized formulations in turmeric supplements raises concerns about quality and safety. Pendleton says that without chemical analysis of every batch, it’s difficult to know the precise composition of the product you’re taking. She adds that contamination with heavy metals, stemming from the soil in which turmeric is grown, is another potential risk due to inadequate safety testing.\n\nWhile some people may benefit from taking turmeric supplements, others may need to avoid them. “Caution is advised for individuals with gallbladder issues, bleeding disorders, kidney stones, or hormone-sensitive conditions,” says Kenney. Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals should avoid high-dose turmeric supplements, as their safety has not been adequately studied in these groups. In addition, people taking certain medications such as blood thinners, antidiabetics, antacids, immunosuppressants and hormone therapies should consult a health care provider before supplementing with turmeric due to potential adverse interactions.\n\nWhen choosing the ideal turmeric supplement, Niswanger recommends sourcing it from a reputable company that performs independent verification. This ensures the supplement is free from high contaminants and contains the ingredients and dosages stated on the label.\n\nFor better absorption and enhanced effectiveness, Kenney suggests choosing a turmeric supplement that contains black pepper extract (piperine)—unless contraindicated. She also recommends taking it with a meal that contains healthy fats to further boost absorption and maximize its benefits.\n\nTurmeric supplements offer a convenient and concentrated way to tap into the potential benefits of curcumin, particularly in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. While research is promising for conditions like joint pain, heart disease, IBS and Alzheimer’s, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness. As with any supplement, it’s important to consult a health care provider to discuss your unique medical history, potential side effects and medication interactions associated with taking turmeric. “Turmeric is much safer and more delicious eaten as a whole spice versus a highly concentrated supplement form,” says Pendleton. However, if you do choose to take a turmeric supplement, it’s important to ensure it fits into a well-balanced dietary regimen.\n\nIs it good to take turmeric every day?\n\nTaking a turmeric supplement is considered safe at doses up to 8 grams. However, more research is needed on its long-term use. Before incorporating new supplements into your daily routine, you should always consult your health care provider to discuss potential medication interactions and side effects.\n\nCan turmeric burn abdominal fat?\n\nLimited research suggests that turmeric’s bioactive compound, curcumin, may indirectly support weight management by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and by improving metabolic health. However, research on this topic is fairly new, with limited studies directly linking turmeric supplements to lower abdominal fat.\n\nWhat organs benefit from turmeric?\n\nResearch suggests that turmeric can benefit several organs, including the heart, joints, gastrointestinal tract and brain. However, more studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.\n\nWhat cannot be mixed with turmeric?\n\nPeople who take medications like blood thinners, antidiabetics, antacids, immunosuppressants and hormone therapies should avoid taking a turmeric supplement. Combining turmeric with these medications can interfere with their effectiveness or cause adverse side effects. Therefore, it’s always best to consult your health care provider and err on the side of caution when taking herbal and conventional medicines.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Sunday it will dissolve its existing government in Gaza once a Palestinian technocratic leadership committee takes over the territory, as mandated under the U.S.-brokered peace plan. But the group gave no specifics on when the change will occur.\n\nHamas and the rival Palestinian Authority, the Palestinians’ internationally recognized representative, have not announced the names of the technocrats, who are not supposed to be politically affiliated, and it remains unclear if they will be cleared by Israel and the U.S.\n\nThe “Board of Peace,” an international body led by Trump, is supposed to oversee the government and other aspects of the ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10, including disarming Hamas and deploying an international security force. The board's members have not been announced.\n\nMeanwhile, the post-ceasefire death toll continued to rise in Gaza, with Israeli gunfire killing three Palestinians, according to Palestinian hospital officials.\n\nThe ceasefire began with a halt in fighting and the release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for thousands of Palestinians held by Israel. The deal is still in its first phase as efforts continue to recover the remains of the final hostage left in Gaza.\n\nAn Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door information, said Hamas was sending a delegation to talks with Egyptian, Qatari and Turkish officials about moving to the second phase.\n\nIn comments posted on his Telegram channel Sunday, Hazem Kassem, a Hamas spokesperson, called for speeding up the establishment of the technocratic committee.\n\nThe Egyptian official said Hamas will meet with other Palestinian factions this week to finalize the committee's formation. The Hamas delegation will be chaired by top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, the official said.\n\nTrump has said the “Board of Peace \" will monitor the committee and handle the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force, additional pullbacks of Israeli troops and Gaza's reconstruction. The U.S. has reported little progress on any of these fronts, though the members of the board are expected to be announced this week.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov has been selected as the board’s director-general. Mladenov is a former Bulgarian defense and foreign minister who served as U.N. envoy to Iraq before being appointed as the U.N. Mideast peace envoy from 2015 to 2020. During that time, he had good working relations with Israel and frequently worked to ease Israel-Hamas tensions.\n\nAlso Sunday, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met in Jerusalem with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. Saar said Israel was committed to enforcing Trump’s plan, while Motegi expressed Japan’s willingness to play an active role in the ceasefire.\n\nAccording to Japan's Foreign Ministry, Motegi visited the Civil-Military Coordination Center, where the ceasefire is being monitored. He was also set to meet Netanyahu and Palestinian officials in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nIn Gaza, two men were shot dead in the southern town of Bani Suhaila, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. Earlier Sunday, a man was killed by Israeli gunfire in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, according to Al-Ahly hospital, which received the body.\n\nIn response to questions about the Tuffah incident, Israel’s military said it had fired at and hit a “terrorist” in northern Gaza who had approached troops. In a later statement, the military said it had killed a “terrorist” in southern Gaza who approached troops.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. Continued Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 400 Palestinians, according to local health officials.\n\nThe Israeli military says any actions since the ceasefire began have been in response to violations of the agreement.\n\nIsraeli police detain top official\n\nIsraeli police said Sunday they were questioning a top official from Netanyahu's office over possible obstruction of an investigation into last year's leak of classified military information to a German tabloid.\n\nIsraeli media identified the official as Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu’s chief of staff, who is expected to start as the next ambassador to the United Kingdom in the coming months.\n\nHe’s the latest official to be caught up in the scandal, in which Netanyahu’s inner circle is accused of leaking confidential information to German tabloid Bild to improve public perception of the prime minister following the killing of six hostages in Gaza in 2024.\n\nIt comes after an explosive interview by Kan News with former Netanyahu spokesperson Eli Feldstein, who described a clandestine meeting with Braverman in an underground parking lot in the middle of the night in connection with the leak. Feldstein, who has been indicted, said Braverman offered to “shut down” the probe into the leaked information.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid immediately called for the suspension of Braverman as ambassador. “It is unacceptable that a person suspected of involvement in obstructing a serious security investigation should be the face of Israel in one of Europe’s most important countries,” Lapid wrote on X.\n\nIn response, Saar defended Braverman’s appointment and said he would not be removed from it until formally charged or tried.\n\nFrankel reported from Jerusalem. Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.\n\nThis version corrects to say the six hostages were killed in 2024.\n\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

    "fullText": "The Apple iPhone is the most popular mobile phone line in the United States and one of the most popular series of devices in the world with an estimated 1.6 billion iPhone users across the globe. Unfortunately, many of those users are now at risk.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Apple has been issuing a warning about a security flaw that data shows would impact around half of those iPhone users, which is around 800 million.\n\nLate last month, Apple began warning users of two critical flaws found in WebKit, which is the browser engine that powers Safari and all browsers on iOS. The flaws left iPhone users vulnerable an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" which would targeting specific individuals.\n\nApple said that the critical flaw could allow hackers to be able to take control of an iPhone or iPad by using malicious websites on the compromised web browsers and trick the device into executing harmful instructions.\n\nThe flaw left users vulnerable to hackers who could potentially take controll of the iPhone or iPad or run code without your permission, possibly obtaining passwords or payment information.\n\nThe good news is that Apple has already created a patch to correct the vulnerability in its latest software update. However, those that have not installed the software update are vulnurable.\n\nForbes estimates that 50% of all eligible iPhone users have yet to upgrade from iOS 18 to iOS 26. Given that there are more than 1.6 billion iPhone users worldwide, this means that around 800 million devices are still vulnerable. StatCounter has an even more pessimistic view, estimating that just 20% of users have upgraded, which would leave more than 1.2 billion iPhone users vulnerable.\n\nAccording to Apple, the devices most at risk include the iPhone 11 and later, the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), and the iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later). Other vulnerable models include the iPad Air (3rd generation and later), the iPad (8th generation and later), and the iPad mini (5th generation and later).\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to protect yourself from these vulnerabilities is upgrade to the latest version of iOS, which is iOS 26.2.\n\nWhile it was expected that Apple would make a security update for users wanting to stick with iOS 18 for a bit longer, that is no longer the case, as iOS 18.7.3 is not available unless you’re running an iPhone that can’t run iOS 26.\n\n“There’s no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully mitigates this risk,” says Keeper Security’s Darren Guccione, via Forbes.\n\nHe went on to explain that upgrading to the latest version of the software is \"the only effective defense. Once patches are public, the exposure window widens for anyone who delays updating.”\n\nThe good news is that installing the update is easy. In fact, for users with automatic updates enabled, the software should be up to date and the patch should already be installed.\n\nIf you do not have automatic updates enabled, you will need to manually download iOS 26.2 or iPadOS 26.2 through their device settings. In this case, users should simply open the \"settings\" app then click \"general\" followed by \"software update.\"",

    "fullText": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of killing a traveling salesman during a robbery is set to become Florida's first execution of 2026 under a death warrant signed Friday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed off on a record 19 executions last year.\n\nRonald Palmer Heath, 64, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Feb. 10 at Florida State Prison. DeSantis oversaw more executions in a single year in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The previous record was set in 2014 with eight executions.\n\nHeath was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a death weapon and multiple forgery charges in 1990.\n\nAccording to court records, Heath and his brother, Kenneth Heath, met traveling salesman Michael Sheridan at a Gainesville bar in May 1989. After hanging out at the bar for some time, the three men agreed to go somewhere else to smoke marijuana.\n\nAt some point, the brothers plotted to rob the other man, investigators said. Ronald Heath drove the group to a remote area, where Kenneth Heath pulled a handgun on Sheridan. The man initially refused to give the brothers anything, and Kenneth Heath shot Sheridan in the chest.\n\nAs Sheridan emptied his pockets, Ronald Heath began kicking the man and stabbing him with a hunting knife, prosecutors said. Kenneth Heath then shot Sheridan twice in the head.\n\nThe brothers dumped Sheridan's body in a wooded area and returned to the Gainesville bar to take items from his rental car. The brothers made multiple purchases with Sheridan's credit cards the next day at a Gainesville mall.\n\nRonald Heath was arrested several weeks later at his Douglas, Georgia, home after investigators connected him to the stolen credit cards. Officers recovered clothing purchased with the stolen cards, as well as Sheridan's watch, according to court records.\n\nKenneth Heath was also charged with Sheridan's murder, but he was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea agreement.\n\nAttorneys for Ronald Heath are expected to file appeals to the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nA total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. The state's final execution of 2025 was the Dec. 18 lethal injection of Frank Athen Walls, who was convicted of fatally shooting a man and his girlfriend during a home invasion robbery.",

See our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway. At a share price of US$499.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is drawing attention as investors reassess its recent share performance, business mix, and current valuation signals, using the latest financial metrics as a fresh reference point.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nAt a share price of US$499.10, Berkshire Hathaway’s short term share price return has been relatively steady, while a 1 year total shareholder return of 12.75% and 5 year total shareholder return of 113.76% point to momentum that has built up over time.\n\nIf Berkshire’s mix of insurance, rail and utilities has you thinking about portfolio balance, it could be a good moment to broaden your watchlist with fast growing stocks with high insider ownership.\n\nWith Berkshire trading at US$499.10, showing a 36% intrinsic discount estimate and sitting only slightly below analyst targets, you have to ask: is there still mispricing here, or is the market already banking on future growth?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is trading on a P/E of 16x at a last close of US$499.10, which points to a valuation that sits below several reference points investors often watch.\n\nThe P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share, so you are essentially seeing how many dollars the market is paying for each dollar of recent earnings. For a diversified group like Berkshire, with insurance, rail and utilities alongside a wide spread of operating businesses, P/E is a quick way to stack its earnings price tag against peers and against an estimated fair level.\n\nOn one side, Berkshire screens as good value versus a peer average P/E of 26.9x and an estimated fair P/E of 18.7x. This suggests the current 16x multiple sits below levels the market could move towards. On the other side, it shows as slightly expensive relative to the broader US diversified financials industry on 15x, which hints that investors are paying a small premium to that industry for Berkshire’s earnings profile despite the recent drop in profit margins from 28.9% to 18.1% and a low 9.7% return on equity.\n\nCompared with the sector, that mix is important. The 16x P/E undercuts peers on 26.9x quite sharply, yet it still edges above the 15x industry average. This frames Berkshire as cheaper than similar companies used in the peer set but somewhat dearer than the wider diversified financials group.\n\nExplore the SWS fair ratio for Berkshire Hathaway\n\nResult: Price-to-Earnings of 16x (UNDERVALUED)\n\nHowever, weaker net income growth, lower profit margins, and a modest 9.7% return on equity could challenge the idea that Berkshire’s current P/E offers clear value.",

    "description": "Despite the filing, the Cincinnati-based chain will remain open.",
    "fullText": "Another popular breakfast restaurant chain has been hit with financial troubles, and is now filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nTaste of Belgium made the move to reorganize its business while remaining in operation despite risking foreclosure proceedings on two of the chain’s locations.\n\nAt one time, the restaurant chain had 11 locations in Ohio and Kentucky, but that number shrank due to shuttering eight of its locations over the course of two years, according to the Journal-News.\n\nAs a result, the chain currently has three locations open for business, which are all in Cincinnati: One location at Rookwood at 3825 Edwards Road, another at the Banks at 16 West Freedom Way, and the last at Findlay Market, 1801 Race Street.\n\nThe chain has even turned to Instagram to inform the public that they’re still operating.\n\n“We’re open,” Taste of Belgium said in an Instagram post. “Taste of Belgium has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection so we can keep moving forward.\n\n“From a guest standpoint, nothing changes. We’re serving breakfast, lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch,” the post added.\n\nThe Cincinnati-based chain was founded in 2007 by Jean-Francios Fletchet. Taste of Belgium expanded throughout the years before the closings kicked off in 2024 and 2025, per the Journal-News report.\n\nThe shuttered locations were Crestview Hills, Kentucky, closed in Sept. 2024; 12071 Mason Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, which also closed in Sept. 2024; Clifton Heights, Ohio, closed May 2024; Liberty Township, Ohio, closed May 2024; 7800 Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, which also closed May 2024; 10267 Penny Lane, Miamisburg, Ohio, closed December 2024; 10 Greene Blvd., Beevercreek, Ohio, closed January 2025 and Over-the-Rhine Location, 1135 Vine St., Cincinnati, closed September 2025.\n\nFrom Fletchet’s point of view, the bankruptcy filing – which was submitted on Jan. 6 on behalf of its Taste of Belgium at the Banks and Taste of Belgium Rookwood locations – is “a proactive step to stabilize the business and ensure long-term sustainability” he said in a statement.\n\n“This is not about closing restaurants. It is about keeping them open,” Flechet shared. “Filing for Chapter 11 gives us the protection we need to adapt, stay in business and continue serving our guests. From a customer standpoint, nothing changes. Our doors are open, and our team is here.”\n\nBut when it comes to why the debtor decided on filing for bankruptcy, it was due to changes in consumer dining habits in addition to Covid-19, rising costs because of inflation, a decline in foot traffic in the downtown area, and inflated commissions charged by third-party delivery services, according to WKRC-TV.",

It was a complete shock to me, my family and fellow coworkers.\"\n\nWINK has not yet released a statement and TV station officials were unavailable for comment Jan. 11.\n\nDevitt must be a bit overwhelmed with the outpouring of love and support.\n\nHis Facebook post announcing he was let go at WINK had more than 24,000 comments and 64,000-plus reactions as of noon Jan. 11.\n\n\"We should all write to Wink….best damn weatherman in the land?\" wrote Darlene Conard.\n\n\"The entire viewing audience is livid and shocked!

    "description": "Kansas City Food Not Bombs said it has been serving a free meal at a parking lot off Independence Avenue for 13 years.",
    "fullText": "Kansas City police arrested two volunteers with Kansas City Food Not Bombs on Sunday for trespassing in a parking lot where the group has long served meals, the group said.\n\nTwo people were charged in Kansas City Municipal Court on Monday with trespassing for alleged violations at the address where the group serves meals, according to court records.\n\nThe group — a volunteer, mutual aid organization that provides free, hot, vegan meals on Sundays in a parking lot in Kansas City’s Lykins neighborhood, near the intersection of Independence Avenue and Monroe Avenue — posted a video of the Jan. 4 arrests on social media Friday. The video shows a group of Kansas City police officers placing two people in handcuffs in a parking lot and shooing other people away from the area.\n\n“I told you that you are on private property, and you’re trespassing,” one uniformed officer says as he secures handcuffs around one person’s wrists.\n\nLater in the video, a voice can be heard addressing people gathered near the arrests: “You’re trespassing. Leave. Or you’re going to be in handcuffs too. Does everybody understand? This is your warning. You can film all you want, you’re welcome to, but you are trespassing, and if you don’t leave right now I’m going to arrest you.”\n\nKansas City Food Not Bombs said in a social media post Wednesday that police forced all of its volunteers to leave the area and dispersed anyone arriving for its meal under threat of further arrests.\n\n“Food is a human right,” the group said. “We have the right to public spaces, and the right to demonstration.”\n\nIn an email to The Star Saturday, Officer Alayna Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City Police Department, said police received “multiple complaints from nearby businesses and residents after asking this organization to leave their private property.” She said police took an initial report about the complaints on Jan. 1.\n\n“The two individuals observed being arrested in the video shared had been previously trespassed and refused to leave, resulting in a response from KCPD,” she wrote.\n\nMichael McConnell, a Kansas City resident and one of the two volunteers charged with trespassing, told The Star in an email Friday that he and the other volunteer were not informed they had been officially trespassed until their arrests. McConnell confirmed that he and the other volunteer were arrested for allegedly trespassing in the parking lot of the strip mall where the free meal is served.\n\nHe said the group has been serving meals at that location for around 13 years, and has never had any negative encounters with Kansas City police previously. In fact, he noted, the police department lists the group and its weekly meal as a community nutrition resource on its website.\n\nMcConnell said some business owners in the area have claimed that those who show up for the meals the group serves have “caused trouble in their businesses, supposedly shoplifting, and messes,” he said. The group has been respectful and regularly cleans up trash in the area, he said.\n\n“We cannot be responsible for every action taken by one of the scores of neighbors that we help at some point after they come by our tables,” he said.\n\nKansas City Food Not Bombs sets up an outdoor food line on the edge of the sidewalk for an hour to an hour and a half and serves 50-100 meals and hundreds of pounds of bread and produce each week, McConnell said. Items served include peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, soup, pasta, salad and coffee, and most of the food comes from grocery stores and restaurants and would otherwise go to waste, he said.\n\nHe said Kansas City Food Not Bombs planned to adapt its serving setup to avoid trespassing charges in the future, and said the group hoped to continue to be good neighbors to people and businesses on Independence Avenue.\n\n“Like all other Food Not Bombs groups,” he said, “we do this as a protest against the wastefulness of war, the choice by the government to not solve poverty, and the environmental destruction caused by our wasteful food systems.”",

Follow all the action from Portsmouth v Arsenal\n\nPompey aren’t faring too well in the second division as they welcome Mikel Arteta’s side to Fratton Park, with the former Premier League stalwarts languishing in 21st, though they are no stranger to a giant-killing in this competition, having beaten Manchester United at Old Trafford on their way to winning the FA Cup in 2008.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know ahead of the match.\n\nThe match is scheduled to take place on Sunday, 11 January at Fratton Park in Portsmouth.

Max Dowman is the only other absentee for the Gunners, with Christian Norgaard, Ebere Eze and Gabriel Jesus among those who could start at Fratton Park.\n\nPortsmouth XI: Schmid; Devlin, Shaughnessy, Poole, Swanson; Dozzell, Le Roux; Segecic, Swift, Bowat; Kirk.\n\nArsenal XI: Kepa; White, Timber, Saliba, Lewis-Skelly; Merino, Norgaard, Nwaneri; Madueke, Jesus, Martinelli.",

Most importantly, Johnson and Nakobe Dean were among the key Eagles on the NovaCare Center practice fields on Friday.

Landon Dickerson (rest), Grant Calcaterra (ankle), Jalen Carter (hip), Dallas Goedert (knee), Johnson (foot), Dean (hamstring), Marcus Epps (concussion), Azeez Ojulari (hamstring), and Jaelan Phillips (ankle) were all full participants on Friday and will all play.\n\nBrett Toth (concussion) has been downgraded to out.\n\n— Jason Dumas (@JDumasReports) January 11, 2026\n\nFrom @NFLGameDay with The Insiders on the #Giants’ coaching search and #Eagles RT Lane Johnson being anything but a slam dunk to play tomorrow against the #49ers.

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s relationship with the FA Cup has always carried a sense of history and obligation. It is a competition that has framed eras, rescued seasons and, on occasion, exposed uncomfortable truths. As Brighton arrive at Old Trafford for this third-round tie, United do so in a state of flux, with the spotlight firmly on team selection, fitness updates and the short-term direction of a club still searching for clarity.\n\nThis preview is based on reporting from the Evening Standard, whose coverage has outlined the key selection calls facing interim boss Darren Fletcher as United attempt to balance recovery, rotation and necessity.\n\n25th May 2025 Old Trafford, Manchester, England Premier League Football, Manchester United, ManU versus Aston Villa Christian Eriksen of Manchester United celebrates with his team mates after scoring from the penalty spot for 2-0 after 87 minutes PUBLICATIONxNOTxINxUK ActionPlus12793881 DavidxBlunsden\n\nFletcher’s brief spell in charge has been defined less by revolution and more by stability. Against Burnley in midweek, United lined up in a 4-2-3-1 shape that prioritised structure over adventure, and there is little expectation of wholesale change for the visit of Brighton.\n\nThe emphasis, instead, is on managing minutes. United are slowly reintegrating players who have either been sidelined or marginalised, and this FA Cup tie represents an opportunity to test readiness without the relentless pressure of league positioning. Old Trafford, on a Sunday afternoon, offers both familiarity and scrutiny.\n\nThe midfield is where the balance feels most delicate. Kobbie Mainoo is pushing for just his second start of the season, having returned from injury with a substitute appearance that hinted at rhythm rather than sharpness. Alongside him, Manuel Ugarte is expected to provide defensive cover, allowing United’s attacking midfielders to operate with greater freedom.\n\nGoalkeeper is one of the more intriguing decisions. Fletcher must choose between Senne Lammens and Altay Bayındir, neither of whom has yet made the position their own. The FA Cup, historically, has been kind to goalkeepers seeking a foothold, but it can also be unforgiving when uncertainty creeps in.\n\nIn defence, familiarity is likely to win out. Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw are expected to operate as full-backs, offering width and progression from deep areas. At centre-back, Lisandro Martinez is set to anchor the line, partnered by Leny Yoro, whose composure has been one of the quieter positives in an uneven campaign.\n\nFurther forward, the creative responsibility will almost certainly fall to Bruno Fernandes. He remains United’s emotional and tactical reference point, a player who can impose order or chaos depending on the moment. Mason Mount, having returned from injury, is pushing for involvement, but his minutes are likely to be managed carefully.\n\nTeenager Shea Lacey is another name attracting attention. The winger could be handed a rare start, emblematic of a club increasingly reliant on youth to inject energy and unpredictability into its play.\n\nUnited’s injury list has begun to shorten, though it remains significant. Matthijs de Ligt is still sidelined and will play no part in this tie, while Harry Maguire has only recently returned to the matchday squad. Fletcher has been clear that Maguire’s involvement, if any, will be cautious, with workload management taking precedence over urgency.\n\nThere is also clarity on who will not feature. Amad Diallo, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui remain unavailable due to Africa Cup of Nations commitments, removing several attacking and defensive options from consideration. Fletcher has confirmed that no late returns are expected, meaning selection continuity from the Burnley draw is likely.\n\nNotably, speculation around the inclusion of a 15-year-old prospect has been firmly shut down. Despite FA Cup regulations allowing younger players to feature, Fletcher has ruled out any such involvement, emphasising development over novelty.\n\nBased on current form, fitness and Fletcher’s recent comments, the predicted Man Utd XI is expected to line up as follows:\n\nLammens; Dalot, Yoro, Martinez, Shaw; Mainoo, Ugarte; Lacey, Fernandes, Cunha; Sesko.\n\nIt is a side that blends recovery with responsibility, youth with experience. Benjamin Sesko, fresh from scoring twice at Burnley, will lead the line with confidence, tasked with translating midweek momentum into knockout impact.\n\nBrighton, meanwhile, arrive as a reminder of modern efficiency and coherence. They are well-drilled, unafraid and capable of exploiting hesitation. For United, this tie is less about silverware in January and more about direction. The FA Cup has a habit of revealing truths, and this fixture will offer another chapter in a season still searching for definition.",

    "fullText": "Over the last few seasons, Real Madrid have reshaped their sporting identity.\n\nWhile the club continue to compete at the highest level and sign established stars when needed, there has been a clear and growing commitment to youth.\n\nThe idea is to build from within, trust young players, and create a sustainable foundation rather than relying only on expensive transfers.\n\nThis approach has not just involved scouting young talent from around the world. It has also brought renewed attention to La Fabrica, Real Madrid’s academy, which has started to play a more visible role in the club’s short and long-term plans.\n\nSome argue that academy players only get opportunities due to injuries or squad shortages rather than pure intent.\n\nHowever, whatever the reason, the outcome has been positive for several young players.\n\nRaul Asencio and Gonzalo Garcia are the clearest examples. Both players stepped up when chances appeared, and Gonzalo’s recent hat-trick against Real Betis has pushed him firmly into the spotlight.\n\nPerformances like that send a message that when trusted, youth players can deliver at the highest level.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three La Fabrica players who look well placed to follow the same path into the first team.\n\nReal Madrid have complete faith in Fran Gonzalez. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nFran Gonzalez is a goalkeeper, and on paper, his path looks almost blocked.\n\nAhead of him stands Thibaut Courtois, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation and a key leader in the dressing room.\n\nBehind Courtois is Andriy Lunin, who has proved his worth. That alone makes breaking through extremely difficult.\n\nYet Gonzalez continues to push. Since his senior team debut against Valencia last year, his development has been clear to see.\n\nHe has grown in confidence, improved his command of the area, and shown strong reflexes in high-pressure moments.\n\nThroughout the season, he has produced performances that closely resemble Courtois in style and composure, something that has not gone unnoticed within the club.\n\nHis reputation goes beyond domestic football. Fran was widely regarded as the best goalkeeper at the U-20 World Cup.\n\nInside Valdebebas, there is growing belief that he has what it takes to become a first-team goalkeeper in the future, even if patience will be required.\n\nJoan Martinez is rated very highly by Xabi Alonso. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nJoan Martinez’s story is one of resilience and progress. Although he has only been with Castilla for a short period, that time has been enough to see his quality and potential.\n\nHis talent was already recognised earlier, and under former manager Carlo Ancelotti, he had positioned himself as a serious option before an unfortunate injury brought everything to a halt.\n\nThat setback could have derailed his momentum, but instead, Joan responded with maturity.\n\nNow fully fit, he has become an undisputed starter under Alvaro Arbeloa at Castilla.\n\nImportantly, Joan is highly rated by Xabi Alonso, who sees him as the top academy option should the first team need a centre-back.\n\nDuring the worst phase of the injury crisis, Joan was even called up, though he did not make his debut.\n\nRather than being frustrated, he accepted the situation calmly, using it as a learning experience and that attitude may prove just as important as his footballing ability.\n\nThiago Pitarch’s moment could be around the corner. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nThiago Pitarch is perhaps the closest to making the final jump, as he is the academy player who has spent the most time working under Xabi Alonso.\n\nHe was the first to be promoted, the first to stay around the squad consistently, and one of the familiar faces within the group heading from 2025 into 2026.\n\nDespite nine call-ups, his official debut remains just out of reach. That missing step is frustrating, but it has not slowed his progress.\n\nHe is strong when carrying the ball out from the back, aggressive in pressing, and brave in decision-making.\n\nIn many ways, he fits into the same category as Gonzalo Garcia did before his breakthrough.\n\nWhen his moment will arrive, there is little doubt that Thiago will be ready to seize it.\n\nAt Real Madrid, patience often pays off, and Pitarch looks like another academy story waiting for its defining chapter.",

    "fullText": "A serious incident has shaken Indonesian amateur football: Player Dwi Pilihanto has been banned for life after a brutal foul in the fourth division and was immediately dismissed by his club KAFI Jogja. This was reported by the Indonesian portal 'detikSport'.\n\nIn the league match against UAD FC in the Yogyakarta region, Dwi jumped with full force into the head of his opponent Amirul during a challenge, who then had to be substituted due to injury.\n\nVideos of the foul are circulating on 'X', but we have deliberately chosen not to show them here.\n\nThe referee initially showed a yellow card—a decision that later had massive consequences. The regional disciplinary committee of the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI DIY) launched an investigation and ultimately imposed a lifetime ban on playing and participating in football activities. The official statement said that Dwi had violated several articles of the disciplinary code.\n\nHis club also responded decisively: KAFI Jogja confirmed the immediate termination of the player's contract and stated that they fully accept the association's decision. At the same time, the club wished the injured Amirul a speedy recovery and emphasized a clear commitment to fair play.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, a similar incident occurred in the fourth Indonesian league, where a player jumped with an outstretched leg into the opponent's chest. That player was also banned for life.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇩🇪 here.\n\n📸 MIGUEL MEDINA - AFP or licensors",

    "title": "There’s a lot on the line for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish as they take on the North Carolina Tar Heels",
    "description": "The Fighting Irish will need to defend their home court against the Tar Heels if they’re going to right their ship.",
    "fullText": "The No. 22 North Carolina Tar Heels (13-4; 2-2 ACC) travel to South Bend this Sunday to take on the Notre Dame Fighting Irish (11-4; 3-2 ACC) in a crucial conference matchup. The game will be broadcast nationally via ESPN, with tip-off scheduled for 1 p.m. ET.\n\nWhile North Carolina has gotten off to a lukewarm start to its ACC schedule, the Tar Heels could easily be 4-0 against their conference rivals instead of 2-2. Both of those losses came in overtime, including their most recent game against the Stanford Cardinal; North Carolina was leading the Cardinal at the half, but subpar shooting percentages on free throws (18-for-30; 60 percent) and 3-pointers (3-for-14; 21.4 percent) allowed Stanford to hang around, force overtime and ultimately upset the Tar Heels on their home court.\n\nGranted, North Carolina’s poor free throw shooting has been an issue all season (62.6 percent as a team), and it could be argued that the Tar Heels’ tendency to leave easy points at the line make them more susceptible to losing close games. Back in December, they dropped another home game to Louisville, making only 7-of-12 free throws (58.3 percent) and failing to score a single point in the extra period.\n\nThe Tar Heels will get a chance to redeem themselves on Sunday against a Notre Dame team that has been uncharacteristically inconsistent this season—at least by the program’s lofty standards. After back-to-back losses to Georgia Tech and Duke, the Irish have already lost as many ACC games as they did all of last season, when they went 16-2. They’ve also completely dropped out of the AP Top 25 poll for the first time since 2021. Wins against lesser competition such as Boston College won’t be enough to sway voters; if the Irish are going to regain their national respect, they’ll have beat one or two of the ACC’s better teams.\n\nSunday’s game, then, is an opportunity for both Notre Dame and North Carolina to get back on track.\n\nIt should go without saying that the Tar Heels will need to be more efficient than they were against Stanford if they’re going to win. On the season, they’ve actually been a strong offensive team; strong, physical forwards like Ciera Toomey and Nyla Harris give North Carolina a formidable paint presence, and while the 3-pointer isn’t a huge part of the Tar Heels’ game, they’re usually able to knock it down at an effective enough clip to keep opponents honest. Their offensive rating of 109.7 points scored per 100 possessions (Her Hoop Stats) may still be inflated from non-conference play, but the Tar Heels can nonetheless score well enough to lean on their physical advantages on defense and on the boards.\n\nThe Irish, meanwhile, don’t want a slow, physical game—they want to get out and run. Led by the boundless energy of guard Hannah Hidalgo, Notre Dame thrives at turning defense into offense. The Irish currently rank No. 5 among Division I teams in steals per game (15.5), with Hidalgo racking up 5.9 of them on her own.\n\nThere’s no denying Hidalgo’s individual brilliance. She’s putting up monumental numbers, averaging 24.7 points and 5.5 assists per game to go with her gaudy defensive statistics. The question for the Irish will be who else steps up; senior forward Cassandre Prosper has taken a huge leap, averaging 17.1 points per game on 55.3 percent shooting, but after that it’s mostly been a by-committee approach, with five Irish averaging between 8 and 11 points.\n\nHaving more depth isn’t a bad thing, of course, and it’s quite possible that the Irish’s best basketball is still in front of them. If they force the Tar Heels out of their halfcourt comfort zone and dictate Sunday’s game with their defense, they’ll have a good chance at defending home court against their ranked opponent.",

    "description": "Chicago joined the 2016 Patriots in overcoming a massive fourth quarter deficit to celebrate a playoff win.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots will not enter the NFL playoffs until Sunday night, but they already played a role on Saturday as well — at least indirectly. As Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson said after his team’s come-from-behind win over the Green Bay Packers, the Patriots served as inspiration.\n\n“The one thing that we had done during training camp was, we had shown the film of the Atlanta and New England game, the Super Bowl from 2016,” Johnson said after the Bears’ 31-27 victory. “We have two players on our roster that were part of both those teams. Grady [Jarrett] was with Atlanta, and Joe Thuney was with New England. It was just great to get perspective from both of those players of how that game went down.”\n\nBack in Super Bowl LI between the Patriots and Falcons, New England fell behind 28-3 in the third quarter before a frantic comeback over the game’s final 20 minutes. The game eventually reached overtime, where Thuney and company went straight down the field to score the winning touchdown in a 34-28 win.\n\nThe Bears’ comeback on Saturday did not go to extra time, but it was similarly dramatic. Chicago was down 21-3 at the half and 27-16 with five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. A pair of touchdown passes from quarterback Caleb Williams, however, helped lead the team to an improbable victory.\n\nAs a consequence, the 2025 Bears are joining the 2016 Patriots as the only ever NFL teams to score 25-plus points from a fourth quarter on to overcome a deficit of more than 15 points in a playoff win.\n\n“I think it’s just a good lesson to be learned that it’s 28-3 in the middle of the third quarter and yet the game still being played, and there’s a lot of time left,” said Johnson. “That was my message to the group. It was just reminding them that this has been done before and rather than saying, ‘Woe is me’ and ‘Oh crap, we’re in a hole’ it’s more, ‘This is a great opportunity for us to turn this thing around into a game that we’ll never forget. And that’s what they did.”",

He said: “We will do everything to have him available on Monday.”\n\nThe game will come too soon for Wataru Endo, who is due to resume training soon, and Jayden Danns but Federico Chiesa is set to feature, as Slot insisted he often selects the Italy international, who is of interest to Juventus.\n\nHe added: “He said he played",

On the other side of the ball, Travis Etienne will churn out yards against a Bills run defense that is near the bottom of the league in every metric.\n\nThis total is too high when you consider that Buffalo has allowed the fewest passing yards per game in the NFL (156.9) while the Jags have allowed a league-low 85.6 ypg on the ground. Expect both teams to try to control this game on the ground, leading to the Under 51.5 cashing.\n\nThe Bills have allowed more rushing touchdowns to running backs than any team in the NFL, giving up 18 this season. Factor in catches, and running backs have scored 21 total against them.\n\nThat’s not the only reason Travis Etienne Jr. is the best bet on the board for the Jaguars, as Buffalo has also surrendered the sixth-fewest passing touchdowns, with just 19 through 17 games.\n\nExpect the Jaguars’ running back to find what many call the “ETN-zone” at least once.\n\nJosh Allen has always performed at a high level in the playoffs, and Sunday marks the start of a hopeful Super Bowl run for the Buffalo Bills. The quarterback didn’t play in the season finale against the New York Jets, but he did cash the Over in passing yards in two of his previous four games.\n\nThe last time Allen took the field, he threw for 262 yards in a 13-12 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. The signal-caller threw for 3,668 yards this season, and while he averaged just 187 yards per contest on the road, there’s reason to believe he’ll ball out on Sunday.\n\nThe Jags’ secondary ranks 21st in the NFL in passing yards allowed. This is not a strength for Jacksonville. After a week off, I’ll take Allen to make his presence felt downfield.\n\nEverBank Stadium, Jacksonville, FL\n\nMonitor gametime conditions with our live NFL weather info and learn how weather impacts NFL betting.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "title": "Cowboys news: Former Dallas 1st-round pick weighs in on who should be next DC",
    "description": "Your Sunday morning Cowboys news.",
    "fullText": "Ex-Cowboy has a daring take of who should be their next defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are on the hunt for a new defensive coordinator after Matt Eberflus was fired less than 48 hours after the season finale loss against the New York Giants. Former Cowboys defensive end Marcus Spears has a solution that fans may like, and it makes sense.\n\nOn ESPN’s NFL Live, Marcus Spears was asked who should be the Cowboys’ next defensive coordinator, and he didn’t hesitate to name former Atlanta Falcons head coach Raheem Morris. Spears pointed to Morris’ history of developing defensive backs, and Morris has already emerged as a popular candidate to help fix one of the NFL’s worst defenses in 2025.\n\n“Coverage is a big thing for Raheem, and if you notice, every place that he’s been, defensive coordinator-wise or head coach, he’s always had a star corner,” Spears said. “That’s just what he believes in.”\n\nMarcus Spears advocates for Raheem Morris to be Cowboys’ next defensive coordinator\n\nMorris has had defensive success everywhere he’s been for more than two decades. He was the defensive quality control coach during the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Super Bowl run back in the 2002 season, where he coached Hall of Fame secondary players like John Lynch, Ronde Barber and Super Bowl 37 MVP, Dexter Jackson.\n\nMorris was also the defensive coordinator for the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams back in the 2021 season. It helped to have a monster like Aaron Donald controlling the line of scrimmage, but it’s no coincidence that Morris has been a part of multiple Super Bowl defenses.\n\nGeorge Pickens gets a just reward.\n\nIn his first season with the Cowboys, wide receiver George Pickens wasn’t just trying to benefit from having a fresh start, but was eyeing a big season in his “contract year” knowing he’d be a free agent in March. Not only did Pickens produce his best season with career-highs in every major category, but now he can add All-Pro to his list of accomplishments, that also saw him make his first Pro Bowl. Pickens is one of three Cowboys to earn second-team All-Pro honors by The Associated Press (AP). The list was announced on Saturday and also included a pair of special teams standouts.\n\nKicker Brandon Aubrey and return specialist KaVontae Turpin were also second-team All-Pros. Pickens was behind first-seamers Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Ja’Marr Chase. Aubrey was on the second-team behind Vikings kicker Will Reichard and Turpin finished behind Buffalo’s Ray Davis.\n\nThis is the second year in a row the Cowboys landed a receiver, kicker and returner on the AP All-Pro teams. Last year, CeeDee Lamb and Turpin were first-teamers and Aubrey made the second-team. For Aubrey, he’s been selected on the All-Pro squad in each of his first three seasons in the NFL. In 2023, he was a first-team selection.\n\nAubrey was 36-of-42 on field goals, with all six misses occurring from 50 yards or more. He did make a 64-yard field goal as time expired in regulation, sending a Week 2 game vs. the Giants to overtime. Aubrey then became the first kicker in NFL history to make field goals to end regulation and overtime, helping Dallas to a 40-37 win.\n\nCould Quinnen’s brother make a good add?\n\nEvery offseason it seems like I see a linebacker’s name pop up that the Cowboys need to get to help the defense. This year it may be Quincy Williams. Could he be the guy the middle of the defense is missing? I’ve seen some reactions, and when you dig into the type of player he is the coverage numbers may make you second guess. And honestly, I get it because it doesn’t look pretty. When you actually dig into how Quincy Williams plays, and how he is used, the conversation changes fast. So let’s talk it through like fans, not scouts trying to sound smart.\n\nThe First Thing You Need to Know: This Dude Lives in the Box\n\nQuincy Williams is not a coverage linebacker, and he never has been. He will not be floating around in space trying to run with slot receivers or carry tight ends down the seams. When you look at the snap data, it’s not even debatable. He spent hundreds of snaps in the box, very few on the edge, only a handful in the slot, and almost none on the outside.\n\nThat tells you exactly how defenses should play him.  He is there to attack downhill. If you judge this man based on coverage stats alone, you’re grading a fish on how well it climbs trees. How Quincy Williams Actually Plays\n\nWhat I like about Quincy Williams is simple: when he sees it, he goes. There’s no dancing, no waiting for someone else to make the play. He triggers fast and shows up with bad intentions. Is he perfect? Absolutely not, but were any of the Cowboys linebackers last season even above average.\n\nHe will miss a tackle here and there because of his aggressive play style, but I’ll take that every day over a linebacker who catches blocks and gets pancaked. What I found even more impressive was he lines up all over the box. He can play weak side, strong side, and take inside looks, but he rarely just sat in the middle calling things out. He’s a flow-and-hunt guy, so the Cowboys would need to let him scrape, chase, and hit. That is where his game makes sense.\n\nThis may be another area where people will get twisted.  Yes, you will see him walked up near the line sometimes, but he’s not an edge rusher.  He is not winning with moves or stacking sacks. Those snaps are about pressure and confusion to make the offense account for him, mess with protection calls, and let the defense work around it. He’s a blitzer, not a technician, and if used incorrectly, it looks ugly.\n\n“My goal in life is to retire as the owner that won the most Super Bowls,” Jones said with complete seriousness. “That’s my goal.” Not just to win another one. Nope. To have the most of any owner in history. It was actually a shocking admission, given the recent state of the franchise. Jones obviously got off to a blistering start toward that achievement, winning three Lombardi Trophies in his first seven years of ownership, which was a literal lifetime ago.\n\nIt’s been 30 years since he added to that total. Only 10 of the players who finished the season with Dallas were even alive when Jones last won the big one. But now, at 83 years old, he wants to get serious about stockpiling? “How many more do I have to go as a single owner?” he asked the room. [New England’s] Bob [Kraft]’s got how many, six? I’ve got work to do.”\n\nTo be fair, Jones does seem, by all outward appearances, to be in fairly good health. But to suggest that he’s going to keep running the organization he’s always run it… and suddenly do something that hasn’t happened since the original Toy Story was still playing in movie theaters… and then do it THREE MORE TIMES in awfully quick succession seems too pie-in-the-sky for even the most wildly delusional Cowboys fan.\n\nQuite frankly, one more trophy would be a staggeringly earth-shaking development for this franchise under its current power structure. The only thing crazier than Jones coming right out and saying he plans to win four more championships before he “retires” is the fact that it was only the third-craziest thing he said during Wednesday’s press conference.",

    "description": "Marco Bezzecchi can challenge Marc Marquez as Aprilia now has a MotoGP bike that can perform at every track, according to Max Biaggi",
    "fullText": "Aprilia ambassador and four-time 250cc world champion Max Biaggi says there is no track on the MotoGP calendar that now “scares” the Noale factory.\n\nAprilia enjoyed a strong end to the 2025 MotoGP season, winning three out of the last four grands prix and ending up runner-up in the manufacturers’ championship for the first time in its history.\n\nWhile the jury is out on whether it can make another step to close the gap to Ducati, with data showing that it still isn’t doing enough to become a consistent challenger, Biaggi is more than satisfied with the progress Aprilia made over the course of 2025.\n\nPointing to the results of not just star performer Marco Bezzecchi but also Trackhouse’s Raul Fernandez, the 54-year-old believes Aprilia has fixed its major weaknesses and turned the RS-GP into an all-rounder.\n\n“Now the bike doesn't have any weak points. On some tracks during last year [2024] and the year before, it was very difficult for us. Now, there is no track that scares us,” Biaggi told TNT Sports.\n\n“If you look at the performance, we can be top-three, top-five all the time. And not only Marco, you also see Fernandez starting to perform very well, and he won a race. I have to say this bike is not only for Marco or for [Jorge] Martin, but for other good riders [as well].”\n\nDuring 2025, Bezzecchi re-established himself as a frontrunner in MotoGP, having endured a difficult final season with VR46 the year prior.\n\nApart from his grand prix victories at Silverstone, Portimao and Valencia, he also won three sprint races in the final part of the season to end the year third in the standings, only behind Marc and Alex Marquez.\n\nWhile Marc Marquez’sinjury-forced early exit from the championship makes it impossible to judge how Bezzecchi would have compared against him at full strength, the Italian did go toe-to-toe with the factory Ducati rider in a thrilling duel at Misano earlier in the year.\n\nBiaggi believes that if anyone can stop Marquez in the final season of the current regulation cycle, it is Bezzecchi.\n\n“It's been a great season from the way he started the first few races to the way he ended up,” he said. “I think it's an incredible increase of performance, and Valencia also proved once again he can be the one who can fight with Marc Marquez.\n\n“If you see Bezzecchi’s performances, he did all these performances by himself. He had no team-mate for one year [because of Martin’s injuries], so he tested himself, he proved the bike can be better race by race, podium by podium, winning multiple races.\n\n“So I think it's a very stable performance and we have no doubt that in 2026 he can be the one who can fight with Marc Marquez.”\n\nBiaggi also dropped a tongue-in-cheek remark about Ducati’s German ownership while lauding Aprilia - a relatively small manufacturer - for punching above its weight in 2025.\n\n“I'll be the ambassador worldwide [for Aprilia in 2026],” he said. “I've been in this role for the last almost 10 years, and it's a big privilege for me being affiliated with this manufacturer, and honestly, the only Italian manufacturer here in this paddock because we know Ducati is German by Audi [ownership].\n\n“At the end of the day, we are the only ones [that are Italian]. We're very proud of that and Gruppo Piaggio did an amazing job and put in a lot of effort. It's not possible if you don't put in a lot of effort.\n\nFabio Quartararo reveals MotoGP moment that felt better than 2021 title\n\nThe MotoGP changes Liberty Media should make, according to Sepang CEO\n\n“So, I think there has been this persistent increase in the budget or something every year to make it happen, and we gained the world champion [Martin] with us.\n\n“Okay, we have a lot of bad luck because he injured himself a couple of times this year [2025] but next year our team, not only the bike but the team, can be very, very strong.”\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jeffrey Bassa spoke with reporters during a recent press conference, reflecting on lessons learned from his rookie season.\n\n\"I'm going to go back and look after this season and review on all the things that I did right and on all the things that I did bad and then where can I grow?\" said Bassa, \"That's going to be looking in the mirror and taking a whole look at myself on where do I need to improve, where am I good right now, what do I need to change in my routine and what not when it comes to being in the season, OTA's (and) having a full offseason. That's going to be on me, finally becoming a pro and then having to do that on my own, so I'm excited for that as well.\"\n\nBassa was selected in the fifth round with the 156th pick in this year's NFL Draft, developing into a versatile signal-caller and occasional secondary option while learning under key veterans. Bassa revealed the most eye-opening experience he had in 2025.\n\n\"I wouldn't say unexpected, but when it comes to surprises, I would have to say the time management (and) being on your own. When it comes to time off the field, I feel like I really did a good job of sorting that out, too. There's time where you can spend time for your wellbeing and on your own, like hanging out with your family or doing whatever you need to do, right?\" said Bassa, \"And then there are also times where you need to take care of your body outside of the facility as well. Where there's days you're off, if you play on a Thursday game you're off for a couple of days. I think it would really have to be the time management piece when it comes to that. Just treating it like I always have and taking that process one day at a time.\"\n\nBassa was named Honorable Mention All-Big Ten Conference with the Oregon Ducks in his last season. He played prominently on special teams as a rookie with the Chiefs, but could see more time on defense next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs LB Jeffrey Bassa reflects on lessons from his rookie season",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe AFC wild card round delivers one of the most exciting quarterback showdowns of the weekend as Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills (12-5, No. 6 seed) travel south to EverBank Stadium to face Trevor Lawrence and the AFC South Champion Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4, No. 3 seed).\n\nThis game pits two of the league's premier signal-callers against each other for the right to advance. While Allen and the Bills bring years of deep playoff experience, they will have to contend with a red-hot Jaguars team that hasn't lost since early November and enters the postseason carrying an impressive eight-game winning streak.\n\nThe wild card tilt carries a fascinating historical footnote as well: the Jaguars are 2-0 all-time against the Bills in the playoffs, securing wins in the 1996 and 2017 Wild Card rounds. However, this is a completely different era, defined by the dynamic, explosive offenses led by superstar quarterbacks. Lawrence, in particular, has elevated his game down the stretch, leading the AFC's hottest team with an MVP-caliber run through the second half of the season, a stretch that saw the Jaguars averaging 34 points per game.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills, despite being the lower seed and playing on the road for the first time in the wild card round since 2019, are looking to finally reach the Super Bowl; with the reigning MVP Josh Allen at the helm.\n\nHere's how to listen to the matchup.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channels 225 (Bills), 226 (Jaguars)\n\nJaguars radio channel: 1010XL / 92.5 FM\n\nThe Bills and Jaguars can be found on nationally on SiriusXM, where listeners can tune into the game from any location.

    "description": "\"As a team, we are battle-tested. We are strong as a unit and it showed over the whole season,\" Broncos CB Pat Surtain said.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos now know what to expect in a playoff atmosphere. This time, they have an edge: home-field advantage and the full force of the Mile High faithful (and thin air!) behind them. And they are ready.\n\nDenver played a lot of close games this season, which could help them come the playoffs, where most of the games come down to just a few plays. Quarterback Bo Nix talked about how this could help them in January.\n\n“I think we’ve been fortunate this year to play in a lot of close games and we’ve won a lot of close games,\" said Nix. \"It hasn’t been the pretty… The ones that you want. The flashy, big-time wins. The ones where you get to go over there and sit, rest a little bit in the fourth [quarter]. It’s part of it. Sometimes you have to go and play the tough ones. It’s better to win some of these tough ones than lose them, obviously, for our position. It has put us in a position to understand what winning football is like. We’ve played a lot of playoff teams in these tough situations.\"\n\nSome of the playoff teams the Broncos have faced this year include the Los Angeles Chargers, Philadelphia Eagles, Houston Texans, Green Bay Packers and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Broncos went 4-2 in those games, with two of those wins and one loss being a one-score game; three games (Denver played two against the Chargers) were more than one score, and the Broncos went 2-1 in those games.\n\n\"A lot of them have felt a little bit what physical, competitive football feels like,\" Nix said. \"A lot of guys fighting for a seed or fighting to get in the tournament in general. I think it’ll help us. It definitely won’t hurt us. It’ll give us the experience and speed up the experience for some of the young guys like myself [to] give us the best chance to hopefully go in here and understand how to win some of these games.”\n\nCornerback Pat Surtain also spoke about the playoff atmospheres Denver has been in this year.\n\n“We had some playoff atmospheres this year where we had some adversity early on in the game and we find a way to bounce back and finish games,\" said Surtain. \"I feel like we are definitely battle-tested in that regard and we always find ways to win. Just in the playoffs, though, we can’t find ourselves shooting ourselves in the foot consistently. We have to find ways to really dominate and find ways to get a faster start. I think that’s what we need to focus on moving forward. As a team, we are battle-tested. We are strong as a unit and it showed over the whole season.”\n\nDenver's battle-readiness will be tested when they face their next opponent at Mile High in the divisional round.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Bo Nix and Broncos are battle-tested going into playoffs",

    "description": "With the 2025 portion of the college women's basketball season over, here's who is shaping up to be one of the teams in the 2026 Final Four.",
    "fullText": "It’s a big year for college women’s basketball in Phoenix, with the Final Four heading to Mortgage Matchup Center on April 3-5, and the potential four teams are taking shape.\n\nWhile there are less than three months before the bracket is set, several leading contenders have emerged. Some schools are blue bloods, while others have steadily become powerhouses.\n\nEach team is led by a cast of stars who will undoubtedly make it an exciting stretch ahead of the Final Four.\n\nThe No. 1 Huskies are a heavy favorite to go undefeated in the regular season, which also makes them a heavy favorite for the Final Four.\n\nThe program’s 15-0 start marks its best opening since the 2017-18 season, when it won its first 36 contests before falling, 91-89 in overtime, to Notre Dame in the national championship game.\n\nSophomore forward Sarah Strong, at the forefront of UConn’s success, has made a compelling case for National Player of the Year. Guard Azzi Fudd has also been playing a big role, furthering the Huskies’ bid for a repeat as champions.\n\nIt’s been another big season for No. 2 Texas as the Longhorns basically drifted through nonconference play.\n\nTexas (17-0) didn’t have an easy schedule, but made quick work of several Top 25 teams, including a 76-65 win over then-No. 3 UCLA. Only South Carolina and Ole Miss have challenged the Longhorns so far, with Texas winning by one possession in both games.\n\nFifth-year point guard Rori Harmon is one of the best in the country and has been the engine for the team. Leading scorer Madison Booker has been having another productive season with at least 20 points in five of her past seven games through Jan. 6.\n\nThe Longhorns have a great shot of getting back to the Final Four for the second consecutive year.\n\nUnder coach Dawn Staley, the Gamecocks are always in consideration for the Final Four.\n\nSince losing in last season’s national title game against UConn, South Carolina has dealt with a great deal of adversity in a short span. The Gamecocks received unfortunate news when forward Chloe Kitts tore her ACL in September, sidelining her for the season.\n\nMore recently, key transfer Ta’Niya Latson injured her ankle in late December and has been day-to-day. The starting guard has averaged 16.9 points this season, and was the scoring leader last season at North Carolina State with 25.2 points per game.\n\nHowever, the Gamecocks have found ways to continue their high-level play. Sophomore forward Joyce Edwards leads the team with 21.0 points. Center Madina Okot has been stellar with 11.5 rebounds per game. South Carolina will soon receive more help in the post with Alicia Tournebize, a 6-foot-7-inch player from France, joining the team midseason and gearing up to play.\n\nOne of the more experienced teams in the NCAA, the Bruins have a great shot of making their second straight Final Four appearance, especially with it potentially being center Lauren Betts’ final season.\n\nBetts, expected to go in the top five of the 2026 WNBA Draft, has surpassed 1,500 career points and has made important defensive plays in the biggest moments for the Bruins.\n\nWhile Betts has been key to UCLA’s success, she’s also been surrounded by depth in senior starters Kiki Rice, Gianna Kneepkens, Charlisse Leger-Walker and Gabriela Jaquez.\n\nUCLA’s starting lineup has combined to play 581 collegiate games, which can play a big factor in winning the Big Ten championship and eventually reaching the Final Four.\n\nThere are a lot of SEC teams that have impressed this season, and the Sooners have shown that they deserve to be considered with the likes of Texas and South Carolina.\n\nThe program has steadily improved under fourth-year head coach Jennie Baranczyk, who took Oklahoma to its first Sweet 16 since 2013 last season. Baranczyk has taken the Sooners to at least the second round of the NCAA Tournament in all four seasons.\n\nOklahoma (14-1) has only gotten better, adding highly touted recruit Aaliyah Chavez to its roster. The guard leads the Sooners and is fourth among freshmen nationally with 18.9 points per game.\n\nThe Sooners rank second in scoring offense at 94.5 points per game, while leading the country in field goal percentage defense (29.8%) and rebounds per game (53.1).\n\nSenior center Raegan Beers has continued to be a force on the boards, ranking 10th nationally with 10.8 rebounds per game. She's also second on the team with 17.4 points.\n\nThe only problem is that Oklahoma will have to play Texas and South Carolina in the regular season, and potentially in the SEC Tournament. One of those teams could hurt the others' chances of gaining a higher seed in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nReach the reporter at jenna.ortiz@arizonarepublic.com, as well as @jennarortiz on X.\n\nCatch the best high school sports coverage in the state.

    "description": "While the Big 12 schedule is imposing, ASU coach Molly Miller aims for a spot in the NCAA Tournament. What are her women’s Final Four predictions?",
    "fullText": "Arizona State women's basketball coach Molly Miller, in her first season leading the Sun Devils, has pushed her team to surprising success. ASU carried a 16-1 record into a matchup Sunday, Jan. 11, at TCU (No. 13 in the AP poll, No. 10 in the USA TODAY Sports coaches poll).\n\nWhile the Big 12 schedule is imposing, Miller aims to contend for a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nWhat are her women’s Final Four predictions?\n\n“A biased nod would be the Sun Devils,\" she said recently, \"but the teams I’ve enjoyed watching, and this is probably predictable, are UConn, South Carolina, UCLA and Texas.”\n\nEntering the weekend, those four made up the top of the two major national rankings (the USA TODAY coaches poll and the Associated Press poll): UConn, Texas, South Carolina and UCLA, in that order.\n\nASU received two votes in the USA TODAY poll, good for a tie for 34th, but none in the AP poll.\n\nThe top four boast deep rosters with a collective greatness. Only two players from the top schools, in fact, crack the top 30 for individual scoring as of Jan. 7: South Carolina's Joyce Edwards (21 points per game) and Texas' Madison Booker (19.1 ppg).\n\nMiller believes it's highly unlikely that the top-ranked Huskies won't be playing April 3 at Mortgage Matchup Center.\n\n“UConn, the consensus from everyone would probably be if they’re not in the Final Four, pigs are flying,\" Miller said. \"They’re champions. And, obviously, South Carolina is consistently seen as a Final Four contender. They’ve got the SEC pedigree.\n\n\"I think UCLA cracks it because the talent runs deep there. I like what they have inside and out. And Texas because they’re kind of outside that blueblood prediction, but I like the way they defend, and I think they’ve got some talent.”\n\nASU finishes its regular season March 1. The Big 12 Conference tourney begins March 4 in Kansas City.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: ASU women's basketball coach Molly Miller isolates top 4 teams",

A win for Ohio State would also make them 4-0 in Big Ten road games for the first time since the 2017-18 team, which won its first five Big Ten road games.\n\nWith Brandon Noel out for the foreseeable future with an unspecified foot injury, Gabe Cupps stepped up for Ohio State against Oregon, scoring nine points on 3-of-4 shooting in 23 minutes. Devin Royal registered his third double-double of the season, scoring 14 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in 36 minutes.\n\nThe Huskies could be without two of their four leading scorers on Sunday night, but their availability won’t be known until closer to game time. Senior guard Desmond Claude is currently away from the team due to a personal matter, and was not at practice on Saturday. Sophomore guard Wesley Yates has missed Washington’s last four games with a wrist injury, and will be a game-time decision on Sunday night. Washington coach Danny Sprinkle has not ruled either player out, but said that if Yates plays, his minutes will be limited.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (13-3, 3-0 SEC) stayed undefeated in the SEC after defeating Oklahoma 83-76 on Saturday night, aided by four Aggies scoring in double figures, led by senior forward Rashuan Agee's 16 points and 12 rebounds for his seventh double-double on the year. In attendance, Texas A&M football head coach Mike Elko hosted several key transfer portal players, who collectively enjoyed one of the weekend's best games.\n\nOn Friday night, it was revealed that the Aggies were set to host Alabama transfer wide receiver Isaiah Horton amid Auburn star receiver Cam Coleman's impending decision, and while Horton was not in attendance for the game, Elko was accompanied by former Aggie recruiting target and Colorado transfer receiver Dre'Lon Miller and Illinois transfer defensive tackle Angelo McCullom.\n\nAnother confirmed visitor, Miami transfer DL Donta Simpson Jr, further proves that Elko and his staff are looking add more beef to the defensive line after landing standout transfer edge rushers Ryan Henderson and Anto Naka, who will look to replace unanimous All-American Cashius Howell. Landing either McCullom or Simpson, or both, would complete the 2026 defensive line room.\n\nCam Coleman's recent visit to Alabama could put the Crimson Tide ahead of the Aggies, Texas, and Texas Tech, but that's yet to be determined after the Alabama native returned home before making his final decision. Landing Isaiah Horton wouldn't just be insurance if Coleman isn't an option, but an elite addition to an already established, yet undersized WR Room.\n\nLastly, Dre'Lon Miller is a familiar face who was underutilized during his time at Colorado, and while he doesn't possess Horton's size, his speed and versatility would make up for KC Concepcion's departure.\n\nUpdate: Some conflicting info on the Horton ID in video.

The team has struggled against the run with opponents averaging 123.7 yards per game on the ground against them this season. Williams is one of their best run defenders, so he fills an immediate weakness and also boosts the pass rush.\n\nYou won't find many defensive tackles capable of getting pressure up the middle like Williams. The combination of him and Christian Barmore will aim to wreak havoc against the Chargers' banged-up offensive line and quarterback Justin Herbert.\n\nSlowing down the Chargers' ground game will be key for the Patriots in keeping Herbert behind the sticks and forcing long third-down conversions. The more pressure they can put on the quarterback and the struggling offensive line, the better.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Is Patriots DT Milton Williams playing today?",

He's been an NFL assistant since 2006, working with multiple teams as the defensive line coach. He's been an NFL coordinator once before, albeit briefly.

    "fullText": "Bradley Barcola is the player in question with the Frenchman consistently linked with an Anfield switch over the last year or so.\n\nLast term, the former Lyon man was one of Luis Enrique's standout players and even though PSG want to keep him, it feels like his future could be away from the Parc de Princes.\n\nOf course, the Reds aren't the only team who have been vying for his transfer but with Manchester City already beating Liverpool to the signing of Antoine Semenyo, Slot and Hughes aren't likely to let another one of their targets slip away.\n\nAnd now, after an update from French outlet RMC Sport, Liverpool's move for Barcola may be closer than ever.\n\nPSG have 'offered a contract' to the Frenchman but his team are yet to respond to their offer.\n\nThe reigning Ligue 1 champions wish to 'know the players position' soon as their next transfer window is likely to be influenced, especially if Barcola chooses to exit.\n\nThe French club are 'preparing for all eventualities' and they already have a shortlist jotted down with Barcola being one of PSG's 'key issues.'\n\nThe report rounds things up by stating Liverpool have been interested in the past with the club having another chance to make their move for the attacker.\n\nOne of the main areas that Liverpool are lacking firepower within their squad is their left-wing.\n\nHughes chose to move Luis Diaz on in the summer and even though Slot wanted to sign a new winger, the higher-ups at the club refused.\n\nIndeed, Gakpo's natural position is on the left-wing but since his form has been miles off the pace this term, others such as Florian Wirtz have had to fill in to try and create chances for Liverpool.\n\nGranted, Barcola is likely to be used on the left, the fact he can play anywhere across the front three is a massive bonus.\n\nUnfortunately, a move is unlikely to take place in the winter transfer window but, if Slot is still the man at the helm by the time summer comes around, he could force the higher-ups to dip into the market for a left-winger.\n\nBarcola's ability has also been laid bare more than once with Enrique even dubbing him a 'superb' player which gives the Reds yet another reason to make their move.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool’s season has acquired an unexpected edge of fragility. Not through form, or confidence, or even the grinding toll of fixtures, but through the sudden absence of one of its most quietly important figures. Conor Bradley is out for the season, sidelined by a serious knee injury that now reshapes both Liverpool’s short-term plans and the broader rhythm of their campaign.\n\nThe confirmation arrived via Liverpool’s official channels, with the club noting that Bradley sustained the injury during the latter stages of the Premier League fixture away at Arsenal. Surgery will follow, then a long rehabilitation at the AXA Training Centre. No return date has been offered. That silence is telling. This is not a setback to be measured in weeks, but in months.\n\nFor a player who had become an emblem of reliability and renewal, the timing feels especially cruel.\n\nBradley’s rise this season has been defined not by noise, but by trust. Trusted by the coaching staff to interpret complex instructions. Trusted by teammates to hold the line. Trusted by supporters to deliver competence without compromise.\n\nHis value has never been about headline moments. Instead, it has been about the small, structural details that hold a side together: when to tuck in, when to overlap, when to slow a game that threatens to become too frantic. In a Liverpool side balancing evolution and expectation, Bradley offered calm continuity.\n\nThat calm has now been removed. With Conor Bradley out for the season, Liverpool lose a right-back who had become tactically fluent in a system that demands constant decision-making. The absence forces adjustment, not just in personnel, but in balance.\n\nLiverpool’s confirmation of the injury, first published on the club’s official website, made no attempt to soften the message. A significant knee injury. Surgery required. Rehabilitation underway. No timeframe given. The clarity of the statement underlines the seriousness of the situation.\n\nThe challenge now lies in redistribution. Minutes must be absorbed. Roles must be redefined. Liverpool are not short of defenders, but Bradley’s particular blend of athleticism and positional discipline is not easily replicated.\n\nThis is where the season sharpens. Losing a first-choice player in January does not simply test depth; it tests adaptability. Systems designed around movement and control must flex. Training ground solutions must translate quickly into matchday coherence.\n\nBradley’s absence also strips Liverpool of a developmental narrative that had been unfolding naturally. His season was not merely about filling a position, but about growth within it. That arc has now been paused, possibly until next autumn.\n\nThere is a sense that the injury arrived at a symbolic moment. The Arsenal match was intense, stretched, unforgiving. It demanded resilience in the final stages, precisely the phase in which Bradley has excelled this season.\n\nInstead, it became the point at which Liverpool’s momentum suffered an unseen fracture. The injury may not have altered that single result decisively, but its implications ripple forward. Seasons are often shaped by moments that barely register at the time. A challenge not quite avoided. A landing fractionally awkward. A substitution made too late.\n\nBradley’s knee injury now sits firmly in that category.\n\nFor Liverpool, the task is immediate and pragmatic. Solutions must be found internally, performances stabilised externally. For Bradley, the focus shifts to recovery, patience, and restoration rather than progression.\n\nKnee injuries are as much psychological as physical. The rehabilitation process demands isolation, repetition, and trust in the body’s ability to return. Liverpool’s medical and performance infrastructure will be central to that journey, just as the player’s own resolve will be tested away from the public eye.\n\nThere is confidence that Bradley will return stronger, wiser, and more complete. But for now, Liverpool must continue without him, carrying the quiet cost of losing a player who had begun to feel indispensable.\n\nAs first reported by Liverpool FC’s official website, the club’s statement offers no drama, no speculation, and no shortcuts. Just the reality of football at its most unforgiving: momentum interrupted, plans revised, and a season subtly reshaped by injury.",

After the Rangers scored their first goal…\n\n…The Boston Bruins put belt to ass for 60 straight minutes. 10-2 Bruins Win!\n\nYour TOI Leader was Charlie McAvoy, who had 21:26 logged last night.\n\nThe Bruins got to see what the New York Rangers are without their vaunted goaltender Igor Sheshterkin, and as it turns out, the New York Rangers suck out loud. The Bruins were allowed gorgeous opportunities to score all night, and with Sheshterkin out, the Rangers defense was effectively bullied all night, forcing a goalie change and a historic night in Boston.\n\nKhusnutdinov and Pavel Zacha had hat tricks tonight; as I’m sure you’ve read this is the first time since 1964 since the Bruins have ever had two players record double hatties on home ice.\n\nIn the middle of all this it can be easy to lose the guys who didn’t get hat tricks, but this was a phenomenal night for Fraser Minten, who got two goals, and Charlie McAvoy, who got his 2nd of the year. Good for both of them!\n\nDavid Pastrnak had the first 6 point game in almost 50 years for the Boston Bruins, joining Ken Hodge and Bobby Orr as the only players in team history to do such a thing. Just another moment on the pile for the legend. What a special player.\n\nI’m sure this game will produce some all-timer whining from JT Miller.\n\nJeremy Swayman, now properly rested and to be clear, was not doing nothing all game, had a pretty good finish; .931 SV% on 29 shots is nothing to sneeze at. Now, let’s make absolutely sure Korpi starts today. Okay?\n\nThe last time the Bruins scored 10 in a game was back in 1988, when they absolutely pasted the Blackhawks in a 10-3 contest. That game featured Cam Neely with a 7 point night, Craig Janney with a 3 assist night, Steve Kasper with two goals, and 5 other Bruins scoring in that contest. Tidy bit of work by the B’s tonight. Tidy bit indeed.\n\nThe Bruins continue things on today against the Pens! That game is at 5pm EST.",

    "fullText": "The Ecuadorian defender was forced off in the 57th minute of Thursday’s goalless Premier League draw with Liverpool, initially appearing to clutch the back of his right leg. From the stands and on television, the concern looked to centre on his hamstring, with Hincapié showing visible discomfort as he left the pitch accompanied by the club’s medical staff. He was replaced by Myles Lewis-Skelly.\n\nHowever, subsequent checks have identified the issue as a minor groin injury rather than a hamstring strain. Speaking to the media, Mikel Arteta sought to play down the severity, saying: “Piero suffered a small injury in the groin. We have to evaluate how it evolves over the next week, but everything indicates that it will be of short duration.”\n\nThe episode underlines a recurring theme in Hincapié’s first season in north London. When he arrived from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer, he was still managing the after-effects of groin surgery carried out in Germany, a fact confirmed at the time by Arteta, who acknowledged the defender was not at full fitness on arrival.\n\nThat same area troubled him again in his first appearance for the club, a late cameo in a 2-0 Champions League win over Athletic Club, effectively ruling him out for much of the early part of the campaign.\n\nIn total, the 23-year-old has now missed 11 games through injury this season, a sharp contrast to his previous record, having barely missed any football across his career prior to joining Arsenal.",

    "fullText": "For weeks, fans have wondered why No. 1–ranked Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Lightweight Arman Tsarukyan was passed over for the interim title fight at UFC 324, which goes down in two weeks in Las Vegas.\n\nWas he still paying for his last-minute withdrawal from UFC 311?\nDid his altercation with a fan come back to haunt him?\nWhat about his recent headbutt of Dan Hooker?\n\nAs it turns out, it was a little bit of everything.\n\nIn a recent interview with streamer Adin Ross, the 29-year-old revealed that UFC officials intentionally left him off the promotion’s first-ever Paramount card because of the baggage surrounding him.\n\n“I was supposed to fight for the title, and then they said, ‘You’re too dangerous to put you on the first card on Paramount because of the headbutt, pull-out, beating up fans,’” Tsarukyan said. “They told me I had to wait. What can I do? I’ll just wait. I know the belt will be mine. I work every day for it. It is what it is.”\n\nJust days earlier, UFC CEO Dana White confirmed that Tsarukyan’s headbutt of Hooker played a major role in the promotion choosing Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett instead.\n\nThere’s no denying Tsarukyan has had a rough year — and largely brought it on himself. His late withdrawal from UFC 311 threw that card into chaos, landing him in MMA purgatory. Then came the Hooker headbutt, which could have derailed the UFC Qatar main event and appears to have been the final straw.\n\nUFC officials also haven’t forgotten Tsarukyan punching a fan during his walkout at UFC 300, nor the altercation with King Green at a UFC host hotel in Dallas back in 2023.\n\nSimply put, Tsarukyan has been a walking headache for the promotion over the last couple of years.\n\nThere’s currently no timetable for his Octagon return, and it appears, according to the UFC head honcho, that he’ll need to fight — and beat — another top contender to earn his way back into the UFC’s good graces.\n\nIn the meantime, Tsarukyan has stayed busy on the mats. He recently competed at Real American Freestyle (RAF), where he dominated former four-time NCAA Division I All-American Lance Palmer, earning a 10-0 technical fall (watch highlights).",

    "fullText": "Zurich-based firm taps into latest robot tech to ‘fibre-spray’ high-end sports shoes worn by the likes of Roger Federer\n\nA robot leg whirs around in a complex ballet as an almost invisible spray of “flying fibre” builds a hi-tech £300 sports shoe at its foot.\n\nThis nearly entirely automated process – like a sci-fi future brought to life – is part of the gameplan from On, the Swiss sports brand that is taking on the sector’s mighty champions Nike and Adidas with a mix of technology and chutzpah.\n\nThe brand is expanding rapidly after teaming up with the former tennis pro Roger Federer to create shoes suitable for the Swiss star’s sport and a mix of fashion-led collaborations including with the luxury brand LOEWE, actor Zendaya and singers FKA twigs and Burna Boy. In China, sales have doubled year-on-year. Growth has been strong in the US and mainland Europe and this month On will open its fourth London store, in Kensington.\n\n“We’re an innovation brand at heart,” says its co-founder, David Allemann, “because we are really going for the long run.”\n\nHe’s speaking from On’s Zurich head office, which has the vibe of a tech firm or luxe gym with light-filled spaces and quirky design features from the spiral staircase and workout room to a hanging fossilised tree.\n\nAllemann says the company’s inspirations are disruptors such as Apple and Dyson. These two brands were on the “mood board” when On was set up as they combine “unique design” with “innovation in terms of user-experience or technology”.\n\nAllemann, a former McKinsey consultant, ditched his job in 2010 as marketing boss of the furniture brand Vitra to start On with a former McKinsey colleague, Caspar Coppetti, and the Swiss Ironman world champion and triathlete Olivier Bernhard.\n\nBernhard’s idea was for a shoe that would protect his body from the impact of long-distance running but also promote speed. The original prototype, developed by Bernhard, an inventive individual as well as a committed sportsman, started out with sections of hose-pipe glued to the bottom of an old pair of trainers.\n\nThe three friends, all keen runners, tried out early versions together and put about £600,000 of their life savings into launching the company. They ordered 1,200 pairs of shoes, which they sold at running meets before convincing some specialist retailers to place orders.\n\nIn 2021, the trio floated the brand on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of $8bn (£5.95bn) , raising almost $750m for the business and netting them about $120m in cash while keeping a large stake in the business. This year they expect to sell 30m pairs. The brand is now worth $16bn.\n\nAfter their innovative design took off, On developed the LightSpray flying fibre technology after a team member met a young student, Johannes Voelchert, at a design fair in 2019. The company decided to fund him for a year to develop his vision, which was inspired by a glue gun used to make Halloween spider-web decorations.\n\n“We said: hey, he’s crazy, but we like that because Olivier was crazy as well,” says Allemann.\n\nVoelchert is now part of a team of hundreds of research and technology experts, from more than 90 countries and numerous industry backgrounds, helping to develop new ideas for On in Zurich with a particular eye on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\n“We call that the explorer spirit,” says Allemann.\n\nThe idea is to foster innovation and creativity so that, even as a bigger company employing 4,000 people around the world, the whole business, from designers to manufacturers, can take risks on ideas without necessarily knowing the final outcome. “We’re still able to set sail without exactly knowing where we’re arriving without calling home the next day,” Allemann says.\n\nAllemann adds that On is now seeing the benefit of “many little sprouts that now are growing up”, from its move into different sports – such as outdoor training and tennis – to its development of apparel and the opening of retail stores.\n\nThe small brand may control just 1% of the $450bn global sportswear market, according to GlobalData, but it is expanding rapidly.\n\nOn plays in the premium market with its shoes starting from about £120, excluding seasonal promotions, up to £495. That compares with Nike, which runs from £60 to £290, and Adidas, from £40 to £450.\n\nDespite high-end purchases coming under pressure from cost of living increases, sales for the brand are on track to increase by just over a third to hit nearly 3bn Swiss Francs (£2.8bn) this year. On says it has grabbed as much as a fifth of the running shoe market in the UK and other European countries.\n\nIt faces some heavyweight competition. On is just one-tenth the size of Nike, which holds about 14% of the global sportswear market, according to industry analysts GlobalData, with Adidas on 9%. However, both have faced difficulties in recent years, creating space for new challenges including On, Hoka and revitalised old brands such as New Balance or Onitsuka Tiger, now owned by ASICS.\n\nThe company also faced a class action lawsuit last year in the US, where customers claimed its shoes make a “noisy and embarrassing squeak”. Its “CloudTec” trainers, designed with holes to feel like “running on clouds” – were criticised on social media over the noise. On said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nOn’s Cloudboom Strike LS laceless shoe, which is made by just nine robots in Zurich and costs £310, has already won the attention of running enthusiasts after the Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri won this year’s New York and last year’s Boston marathon. She also took a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in a pair.\n\nIn Zurich, the robots in their lab-like room are still outnumbered by humans, who monitor their work and complete the final process. Most of the brand’s footwear is made in traditional factories in Asia. But this year On is aiming to open its first robot-led factory to create a more accessible version of the shoe, the upper half of which is made from a single nearly one mile-long filament of thermoplastic polyurethane in just three minutes. Traditionally, a shoe takes several humans hours of work.\n\nThe factory’s location has not yet been decided, but will be close to one of its main retail markets, with the long-term aim of producing on every continent. That would be a dramatic change from today’s industry, which is largely based in Asia, particularly Vietnam and China.\n\nAllemann says local manufacturing is attractive as it has “a huge advantage from a sustainability point of view, because you don’t have to ship shoes around the world, but also from an agility to market point of view – you can produce much faster, according to what people want”.\n\nHe says LightSpray shoes have a 75% lower CO2 footprint than an ordinary sports shoe, which plays to On’s aim to create more sustainable and recyclable kit.\n\nRetail expansion is also a big part of the story. The latest London opening will make the UK capital its biggest retail centre, with plans for as many as seven in future. It is now part of a global portfolio of 60 outlets, with plans for up to 25 more a year despite the rise of online selling.\n\n“We feel there’s still a lot of potential in retail, if done right. City centres are still a very important place for society, and shopping and sports are an important ingredient to that.”\n\nWith those in their late teens, 20s and 30s keen on sport, particularly training and running, Allemann says the shops “are not just stores but also community hubs where running clubs start”.\n\nHe believes On will continue to expand because participating in sport brings people together in a way the online world cannot.\n\n“Running and sports, that’s such an important part of your life that we see consumers are willing to invest in great performance, innovation and better feel, but also in great design and what that tells us about them.”",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Guardian investigation finds AI Overviews provided inaccurate and false information when queried over blood tests\n\nGoogle has removed some of its artificial intelligence health summaries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading information.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information, putting users at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy.\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” served up masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients, the Guardian found.\n\nWhat Google’s AI Overviews said was normal may vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result, and not bother to attend follow-up healthcare meetings.\n\nAfter the investigation, the company has removed AI Overviews for the search terms “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests”.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We do not comment on individual removals within Search. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nVanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity, said: “This is excellent news, and we’re pleased to see the removal of the Google AI Overviews in these instances.\n\n“However, if the question is asked in a different way, a potentially misleading AI Overview may still be given and we remain concerned other AI‑produced health information can be inaccurate and confusing.”\n\nThe Guardian found that typing slight variations of the original queries into Google, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range”, prompted AI Overviews. That was a big worry, Hebditch said.\n\n“A liver function test or LFT is a collection of different blood tests. Understanding the results and what to do next is complex and involves a lot more than comparing a set of numbers.\n\n“But the AI Overviews present a list of tests in bold, making it very easy for readers to miss that these numbers might not even be the right ones for their test.\n\n“In addition, the AI Overviews fail to warn that someone can get normal results for these tests when they have serious liver disease and need further medical care. This false reassurance could be very harmful.”\n\nGoogle, which has a 91% share of the global search engine market, said it was reviewing the new examples provided to it by the Guardian.\n\nHebditch said: “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health.”\n\nSue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, welcomed the removal of the summaries but said she still had concerns.\n\n“This is a good result but it is only the very first step in what is needed to maintain trust in Google’s health-related search results. There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information.”\n\nMillions of adults worldwide already struggle to access trusted health information, Farrington said. “That’s why it is so important that Google signposts people to robust, researched health information and offers of care from trusted health organisations.”\n\nAI Overviews still pop up for other examples the Guardian originally highlighted to Google. They include summaries of information about cancer and mental health that experts described as “completely wrong” and “really dangerous”.\n\nAsked why these AI Overviews had not also been removed, Google said they linked to well-known and reputable sources, and informed people when it was important to seek out expert advice.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Our internal team of clinicians reviewed what’s been shared with us and found that in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.”\n\nVictor Tangermann, a senior editor at the technology website Futurism, said the results of the Guardian’s investigation showed Google had work to do “to ensure that its AI tool isn’t dispensing dangerous health misinformation”.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company constantly measures and reviews the quality of its summaries across many different categories of information, it added.\n\nIn an article for Search Engine Journal, senior writer Matt Southern said: “AI Overviews appear above ranked results. When the topic is health, errors carry more weight.”",

    "fullText": "Conservative leader backs Australian-inspired policy to stop platforms ‘profiting from their anxiety’\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nThe Conservatives are backing a ban on social media for under-16s in an attempt to prevent addictive platforms fuelling anxiety and distraction among teenagers.\n\nKemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said she did not like the word ban but she wanted to see an age limit of 16 in the same way that Australia had introduced restrictions on social media for children.\n\nHer new policy will add to growing pressure on the government to act, with Wes Streeting, the health secretary, having recently suggested he would like to see more action to protect children online.\n\nThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, has said previously he was personally against such a move and Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, has also stated her opposition but the government is closely monitoring the reaction to Australia’s ban and considering its policy options. In Australia, under-16s are now prevented from setting up accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch.\n\nBadenoch told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “What we are seeing is a lot of children spending so many hours a day on platforms that are profiting from their anxiety, from their distraction, and they are actually designed to be addictive.\n\n“So what we want to see is common sense, protection for children and freedom for adults. We want to give parents some understanding that the government understands what they’re going through. So we want to bring in age limits.\n\n“The internet is a wild west, social media in particular. We don’t think children should be on there, and we want the industry to set the direction of travel so that we can start working with them now in order to get the proper solutions in place.”\n\nThe Conservatives said that, if elected, they would ban smartphones in schools and ask social media companies including TikTok and Snapchat to use age verification tools to prevent under-16s from accessing their platforms. The scope of the policy would be kept under review, the party said.\n\nOn Sunday, one of the UK’s biggest teaching unions, NASUWT, called on the government to ban social media for under-16s over concerns about mental health and concentration. It wants legislation to be tightened so big tech firms would face penalties for allowing children to access their platforms.",

    "fullText": "I first began to believe this on a Friday morning this past summer, while working on a small hobby project. A few months back, my friend Ben and I had resolved to create a Times-style crossword puzzle entirely by computer. In 2018, we’d made a Saturday puzzle with the help of software and were surprised by how little we contributed—just applying our taste here and there. Now we would attempt to build a crossword-making program that didn’t require a human touch.\n\nWhen we’ve taken on projects like this in the past, they’ve had both a hardware component and a software component, with Ben’s strengths running toward the former. We once made a neon sign that would glow when the subway was approaching the stop near our apartments. Ben bent the glass and wired up the transformer’s circuit board. I wrote code to process the transit data. Ben has some professional coding experience of his own, but it was brief, shallow, and now about twenty years out of date; the serious coding was left to me. For the new crossword project, though, Ben had introduced a third party. He’d signed up for a ChatGPT Plus subscription and was using GPT-4 as a coding assistant.\n\nSomething strange started happening. Ben and I would talk about a bit of software we wanted for the project. Then, a shockingly short time later, Ben would deliver it himself. At one point, we wanted a command that would print a hundred random lines from a dictionary file. I thought about the problem for a few minutes, and, when thinking failed, tried Googling. I made some false starts using what I could gather, and while I did my thing—programming—Ben told GPT-4 what he wanted and got code that ran perfectly.\n\nFine: commands like those are notoriously fussy, and everybody looks them up anyway. It’s not real programming. A few days later, Ben talked about how it would be nice to have an iPhone app to rate words from the dictionary. But he had no idea what a pain it is to make an iPhone app. I’d tried a few times and never got beyond something that half worked. I found Apple’s programming environment forbidding. You had to learn not just a new language but a new program for editing and running code; you had to learn a zoo of “U.I. components” and all the complicated ways of stitching them together; and, finally, you had to figure out how to package the app. The mountain of new things to learn never seemed worth it. The next morning, I woke up to an app in my in-box that did exactly what Ben had said he wanted. It worked perfectly, and even had a cute design. Ben said that he’d made it in a few hours. GPT-4 had done most of the heavy lifting.",

    "description": "Five conditions determine whether revolutions succeed. For the first time since 1979, Iran meets nearly all of them.",
    "fullText": "Forty-seven years ago, Iran had a revolution that replaced a U.S.-allied monarchy with an anti-American theocracy. Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran may be on the verge of a counterrevolution.\n\nHistory suggests that regimes collapse not from single failures but from a fatal confluence of stressors. One of us, Jack, has written at length about the five specific conditions necessary for a revolution to succeed: a fiscal crisis, divided elites, a diverse oppositional coalition, a convincing narrative of resistance, and a favorable international environment. This winter, for the first time since 1979, Iran checks nearly all five boxes.\n\nIn the past week, protests have engulfed Iranian cities, their momentum growing daily. These began as a response to a fiscal crisis: a national currency in free fall, a state with empty coffers. In American politics, inflation rates of more than 3 percent tend to bring down administrations. Iran’s inflation rates—more than 50 percent across the board, 70 percent for food—are among the world’s highest. Over the past year, Iran’s currency has fallen more than 80 percent relative to the dollar. In 1979, a single U.S. dollar was worth 70 Iranian rials; today, it’s worth 1.47 million rials, a depreciation of more than 99 percent. Iranian currency has become less a medium of exchange than a daily index of national despair. And unlike past economic crises, this collapse has crossed all class lines, affecting bazaar merchants and the well-off as well as the poor.\n\nIran has 92 million inhabitants, perhaps the largest population in the world to have been isolated for decades from the global financial system. In addition to inflation, the country suffers from endemic corruption, mismanagement, and brain drain. Young Iranians contend with high rates of unemployment and underemployment; older generations have found their pension funds to be largely insolvent. Renewed global sanctions and the dwindling price of oil—down 20 percent in the past year—have forced Tehran to sell its oil to China at a backbreaking discount. Power outages and water rationing have become fixtures of daily life.\n\nThe second condition for state breakdown—the alienation of the elite—is also widely evident in Iran. What began in 1979 as a broad ideological coalition has, by 2026, contracted into a one-man party: the party of Ali Khamenei. Mir Hossein Mousavi, a founding father and the former prime minister of the Islamic Republic, is in his 15th year of house arrest. Every living former president has been silenced or sidelined: Mohammad Khatami is under a total media ban, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is marginalized and monitored, Hassan Rouhani was barred from seeking a seat in the 88-member Assembly of Experts (the clerics who choose the next supreme leader).\n\nThe regime has been hollowed out by decades of negative selection—the result of rewarding mediocrity and prizing ideological loyalty over competence. The effect has been to alienate the professionals and technocrats who once provided the state with its administrative backbone. Replaced by sycophants and suffocated by the clergy’s interference in daily life, this class has long since lost faith in the system. It sees its wealth eroded by inflation, and the country ruined by incompetence—a failure now undeniable in the mismanagement of Tehran’s water supply.\n\nMuch like the Soviet Union of the 1980s, the Islamic Republic has mostly lost its convictions. Only a small percentage of its insiders remain true believers; the majority are motivated by wealth and privilege. One Tehran-based political-science professor we spoke with put a finer point on this: “At the beginning of the revolution, the regime was 80 percent ideologues and 20 percent charlatans. Today, it is the reverse.”\n\nBazaar merchants played a pivotal role in the 1979 revolution, serving for years as a core constituency and economic base for the Islamic Republic. But in recent decades, the regime has built the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps into a military-industrial complex from which networks of wealth and power flow. Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman held hostage by the regime for eight years, compared the Iranian state to “a collection of competing mafias—dominated by the IRGC and its alumni—whose highest loyalty is not to nation, religion, or ideology, but to personal enrichment.” This system has not only weakened the regime’s ideological cohesion but also displaced the traditional merchant class, turning the bazaar from a pillar of support into a source of dissent.\n\nStill, one group of elites remains united: the country’s security forces. Their solidity has, until now, prevented the Islamic Republic’s collapse. No senior IRGC commanders have defected as yet or voiced even mild public criticism of Ayatollah Khamenei, despite years of nationwide protests and the targeted Israeli assassination of nearly two dozen senior figures in their ranks. For many of these commanders, losing power would mean losing wealth and potentially their life. They would likely be the last leaders to turn against the regime. But if they did, the regime would not survive.\n\nIran clearly meets the third criterion: The Islamic Republic’s political, economic, and social authoritarianism has created a diverse oppositional coalition in response to perceived injustice. Over the past decade, intermittent mass protests have drawn participants from virtually every socioeconomic class, including ethnic minorities on the periphery of the country, labor movements, women, and bazaaris. These groups have rarely coordinated their efforts or protested in unison. But many of their reasons for outrage are broadly shared.\n\nRead: Change may be coming to Iran\n\nThe Islamic Republic is a theocracy that claims to rule from a moral pedestal. For this reason, examples of its graft and hypocrisy are particularly galvanizing. IRGC commanders oversee the brutal enforcement of the veiling of women—but their daughters and mistresses are spotted overseas without hijab. The country is suffering from a severe water shortage—and many Iranians believe that a “water mafia” linked to the IRGC is diverting resources to their own industrial projects while entire villages are left to die of thirst. The children of thousands of senior officials advertise their lives in Western cities on Instagram and LinkedIn. Protesters in the city of Yasuj recently chanted, “Their children are in Canada! Our children are in prison!”\n\nThe opposition movement has shown that it can mobilize widespread fury, but to succeed, it will need to move beyond mobilization and forge links with disgruntled elites. Some of these technocrats and marginalized insiders feel alienated but are too afraid to act because of what may await them the day after. The opposition needs to offer a credible safe exit for these regime insiders, convincing them that the Islamic Republic is no longer their shield, but their shroud.\n\nRevolutions arise when rulers become weak and isolated; when people believe themselves to be part of a numerous, united, and righteous group that can act to create change; and when political elites begin to attach themselves to the people, abandoning the government rather than defending it. In Iran, thus far, the last ingredient has been missing.\n\nThe fourth condition for state breakdown is a convincing shared narrative that bridges a nation’s socioeconomic, geographic, and ideological divides. In Iran today, the regime’s founding principle of pan-Islamic revolutionary ideology has been supplanted by a fierce, corrective nationalism. The state’s shopworn mantras of “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” are being drowned out by a demand for national self-interest: “Long live Iran.” This is not merely a change in tone, but a total rejection of the regime’s regional adventurism, punctuated by the now-ubiquitous protest chant: “No to Gaza; no to Lebanon; my life only for Iran.”\n\nBeyond a surge in nationalism, Iranians have grown immune to the hollow ideological slogans and performative piety of a self-appointed “moral” state. A population largely born after the 1979 revolution seeks, above all, zendegi-e normal—a “normal life,” liberated from a regime that micromanages people’s attire, intimacy, and private choices. By delegitimizing the Islamic Republic as an occupying force—one that plunders national wealth to subsidize regional proxies—the opposition has effectively subverted the regime’s nationalist rhetoric.\n\nEvery successful revolution requires both inspirational and organizational leadership. Many of the protesters in Iran’s 2026 uprising have rallied behind former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since 1979. Leading an opposition from exile and restoring a deposed monarchy are both daunting, but neither is unprecedented. Vladimir Lenin in Russia, Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran all spent more than 15 years in exile before returning to lead revolutions that toppled the regimes that had banished them. Several countries that once abolished their monarchies—including Spain, Cambodia, and Britain (under Oliver Cromwell)—later restored them as constitutional monarchies.\n\nAs Iranians know well from 1979, ruthless contests tend to define revolutions. Having spent nearly half a century abroad, Pahlavi has not yet organized the on-the-ground muscle needed to prevail in such a contest. He also faces a deeper question: What kind of order do Iran’s monarchists aspire to establish? Pahlavi has consistently said that his goal is to help Iran transition to democracy—and perhaps to serve as a constitutional monarch if chosen by the people. Yet many of his most passionate supporters are vocal about restoring an absolute autocracy. This tension has inhibited his ability to flip disaffected elites against the regime.\n\nYet ironically, among the broader population, this ambiguity could work in his favor. Revolutionary ideologies need not provide a precise future plan to unite and motivate their followers. On the contrary, what often works best are vague or utopian promises of deliverance, combined with an emotionally powerful depiction of the intolerable injustice and inescapable evils of the current regime.\n\nThe final and decisive catalyst for revolution is an international environment that helps sink the regime rather than bolster it. After North Korea, Iran may be the most strategically isolated country in the world. Over the past two years—since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which Ayatollah Khamenei alone among major world leaders openly endorsed—Iran’s regional proxies and global allies have been decimated or deposed.\n\nRead: How Trump could help the people of Iran\n\nFor decades, Tehran projected strength through its so-called Axis of Resistance, a network of nearby proxies and autocratic allies. But following the devastating 12-day war in June, that deterrent has been degraded. With Hezbollah’s and Hamas’s leadership in disarray and Israeli jets maintaining a humiliating, virtually uncontested presence over Iranian airspace, the regime is strategically naked before its people—exposed by an empty treasury and an unprotected sky.\n\nSyria’s Bashar al-Assad and Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro are no longer in power. Vladimir Putin is consumed fighting a war in Ukraine. China—the destination for 90 percent of Iran’s oil exports—has proved to be a predatory partner. Donald Trump dropped 16 bunker-busting bombs atop Iran’s nuclear facilities, largely destroying an enterprise that—between sunk costs, sanctions, and lost oil revenue—had cost the nation more than half a trillion dollars. Moreover, in contrast to past U.S. presidents who were reluctant to enter Iran’s political fray, Trump has warned the Islamic Republic that if it massacres protesters, the United States is “locked and loaded” to respond.\n\nObservers of the current protests ask: What is different this time? The answer is that the breadth of the economic collapse and the disastrous defeat in the 12-day war have shown all Iranians that the regime is no longer capable of providing them with basic economic or military security. Why tolerate a state that enriches itself but cannot fulfill the most elemental state functions?\n\nWhen the five conditions coincide—economic strain, alienation and opposition among the elites, widespread popular anger at injustice, a convincing shared narrative of resistance, and favorable international relations—the normal social mechanisms that restore order in a crisis are unlikely to work. The society’s equilibrium has been profoundly disrupted and can easily tip into escalating popular revolts and open elite resistance, producing a revolution.\n\nThe Islamic Republic is today a zombie regime. Its legitimacy, ideology, economy, and top leaders are dead or dying. What keeps it alive is lethal force. The most important element still missing from a full revolutionary collapse is the repressive forces deciding that they, too, are no longer benefiting from, and hence no longer willing to kill for, the regime. Brutality can delay the regime’s funeral, but it’s unlikely to restore its pulse.",

    "fullText": "Jan 11 (Reuters) - In a nation where opposition to almost half a century of clerical rule has long been fragmented, the son of the last shah of Iran has become a prominent voice spurring on protesters staging the biggest anti-government demonstrations in years.\n\nReza Pahlavi, 65, has sought to speak as a national leader despite living outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nIn messages sent from his home in the United States, he has repeatedly praised Iranians demanding change and, like those who ended his father’s rule, calling for an end to repression.\n\n\"We will completely bring the Islamic Republic and its worn-out, fragile apparatus of repression to its knees,\" he said in one of his most recent messages, in a video posted on X.\n\nHOW MUCH SUPPORT DOES PAHLAVI HAVE IN IRAN?\n\nHow much public support Pahlavi now commands in Iran, where he has not set foot for decades, is difficult to gauge.\n\nSome protesters have voiced support for him in verified videos circulating on social media, with some chants of \"Long live the shah\", suggesting his messages may be galvanising some people.\n\nMany others simply call for sweeping political change, with slogans such as \"Down with the dictator\", a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who under Iran’s system of clerical rule has the final say in all state matters.\n\nOthers shout slogans demanding action to fix an economy hammered by years of international sanctions and pummelled by a 12-day war in June, when Israel and then the U.S. launched airstrikes on Iran.\n\nThe dire economy was the catalyst for the latest protests.\n\n\"Everything Reza Pahlavi learned about ruling a country came from his own father who failed for a reason. We had Pahlavis, now it is time for a democratic country,\" said Azadeh, 27, in a message from northern Iran.\n\nPahlavi has frequently called for change, particularly during bouts of unrest, including mass demonstrations in 2009 over a contested election and nationwide protests in 2022 over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died while in detention for allegedly violating Islamic dress codes.\n\nIn those protests, there were few obvious signs of momentum in support for a man who the exiled royal court in 1980 declared shah after his father’s death from cancer in a Cairo hospital.\n\nPAHLAVI SAYS HE IS READY TO LEAD A TRANSITION\n\nUnlike in the 1979 revolution, there is no single voice driving the opposition.\n\nFive decades ago, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini became the voice of revolutionary fervour, spurring on demonstrators - even those who wanted a secular system to prevail in Iran. Khomeini’s recorded speeches smuggled in on cassette tapes from his exile abroad stoked opposition to Pahlavi’s father.\n\nIn his messages over the past two weeks, which have been blocked as the government has shut down the internet, Pahlavi has told Iranians he is ready to lead a transition.\n\nHe has long said he would let the people decide on who should rule them, but he has been clear that he wants an end to theocratic rule.\n\n\"There is only one way to achieve peace: a secular, democratic Iran. I am here today to submit myself to my compatriots to lead them down this road to peace and a democratic transition,\" he said in a speech posted on X on June 23, shortly before the end of last year’s 12-day war.\n\nBorn in 1960, Pahlavi was declared crown prince in 1967 at his father’s coronation in Tehran. Images show him sitting beside his father’s jewel-encrusted throne in a child’s version of the shah’s uniform, peaked cap on his lap and gold brocades on his small shoulders.\n\nThe monarchy’s lavish style at that time helped fuel discontent when Iranians compared it to their own hardships, with surging inflation and a big wealth divide as the shah’s bid to modernise the oil-powered economy left many people behind.\n\nIranians also sought an end to repression by the shah and his feared security apparatus, SAVAK.\n\nPahlavi left Iran before his father was forced out, heading to the United States to train as a fighter pilot. He later wrote that he offered to serve in the war with Iraq in the 1980s when the young theocratic Iranian state came under attack, but that his offer was turned down.\n\nHe studied political science at university.\n\nFrom exile, Pahlavi, who is married with three children, has garnered support in the diaspora, including Iranians in the U.S., with his criticism of Iran’s rulers and calls for change.\n\nIn 2023, he visited Israel, a close ally of Iran in his father’s day and an implacable foe of the Islamic Republic now, and met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials.\n\nHe supported the Israeli and U.S. strikes in June that mainly hit Iran’s nuclear facilities, but said more action was needed to support Iran’s people. Israel and Western states accuse Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, which Iran denies.\n\nBut he has gained little traction in winning personal support from Western governments abroad - neither in Washington, a close ally of Iran in the shah’s time, nor in European capitals, which have long been critical of the Islamic Republic and its nuclear programme.\n\nAs the latest protests have unfolded, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would support Iranians if security forces fire on them, but also said on Friday he was \"not sure that it would be appropriate\" to meet Pahlavi.",

    "fullText": "Abstract\r\n This thesis develops a Python-based implementation of practical asset allocation methods based on modern portfolio theory and its extensions. The mean-variance framework introduced by Markowitz remains the standard approach for investment decisions, yet publicly available software tools for portfolio optimization are scarce despite extensive academic research on improved methods. \n\nWe address this gap by engineering asset allocation tools in Python using convex optimization to formulate portfolio problems with various investment constraints. We extend the classical framework beyond the first two moments of return distributions by integrating expected shortfall to capture tail risk more effectively. To reduce estimation errors, we implement shrinkage estimators that combine sample covariance matrices with structured estimators and demonstrate improved out-of-sample performance. Each optimization problem is examined through analytical derivations and numerical examples, with code snippets and visualizations provided for reproducibility.\n\nEmpirical studies using Swiss equity market data show that portfolios constructed with our methods achieve competitive returns while exhibiting lower expected shortfall and reduced excess risk relative to benchmark indices in highly correlated market environments. Our results confirm that most portfolio optimization problems can be expressed in convex form and solved efficiently using Python, providing practitioners with a robust framework for real-world asset allocation.",

The dark comedy tells the story of a washed-up revolutionary who springs into action when his daughter’s life is in danger. Co-stars Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, Chase Infiniti and Teyana Taylor were nominated alongside DiCaprio.\n\nComedian Nikki Glaser will return for a second stint as host of the awards show, which starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time (1 a.m. GMT Monday). The festivities will be broadcast live on CBS and will stream on Paramount+. TV shows also will be honored, and a podcast trophy will be handed out for the first time.\n\nGlaser said Hollywood’s A-list does not need to fear her monologue. Past Globes hosts have lobbed biting jokes at many of the stars in attendance.\n\n\"They shouldn’t be worried because I really have made this set so that it doesn’t ruin anyone’s night,\" she said. \"I don’t think I’m going to have to avoid anyone at the after-party.\"\n\n\"One Battle,\" distributed by Warner Bros, will compete in the best movie musical or comedy category against table tennis tale \"Marty Supreme\" starring Chalamet and black comedy \"Bugonia,\" among others.\n\nThe best movie drama race features \"Jay Kelly,\" starring George Clooney as an actor grappling with his legacy and Adam Sandler as his devoted manager. Other nominated film dramas include Guillermo del Toro’s take on \"Frankenstein,\" supernatural horror flick \"Sinners\" and \"Hamnet,\" a story about the family of William Shakespeare.\n\nAmong other acting nominees are Chalamet, Dwayne Johnson for \"The Smashing Machine,\" Michael B. Jordan for \"Sinners,\" Jessie Buckley for \"Hamnet\" and Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo for musical sequel \"Wicked: For Good.\"\n\nThe Globes are among the first of the 2026 Hollywood accolades to be handed out before the film industry’s top honors, the Academy Awards, in March.\n\nGlobes voters do not have a say in the Oscars, but a win at the Globes can help bring attention to potential Academy Awards contenders.\n\nRecipients of the Globes are chosen by more than 300 entertainment journalists, compared with roughly 9,000 voters who select the Oscars. The Globes voting body was expanded in recent years and organizers instituted reforms after criticisms for ethical lapses and a lack of diversity.\n\nGlobes voters highlighted several international films in this year’s nominations. They include Norwegian family drama \"Sentimental Value,\" \"It Was Just an Accident\" from Iranian director Jafar Panahi, and Brazilian drama \"The Secret Agent.\"\n\nIn a new podcast category, the field includes \"Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,\" \"Call Her Daddy,\" \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler\" and \"The Mel Robbins Podcast.\"\n\nHBO’s vacation mystery \"The White Lotus\" leads TV categories in nominations, ahead of Netflix’s limited series \"Adolescence,\" about a 13-year-old accused of murder.",

    "description": "From Davos and the Super Bowl to Burning Man and St. Barts, see the predictable social calendar billionaires follow and how much it all costs.",
    "fullText": "Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed.\n\nThe world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences.\n\n\"Birds of a feather flock together,\" Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider.\n\nEach year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said.\n\n2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars.\n\nHere's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them.\n\nBusiness leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs.\n\nThis year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed \"A Spirit of Dialogue.\" While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nAccess to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public.\n\nApartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog.\n\nNFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on.\n\nThese billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception.\n\n\"The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment,\" Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nHost committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash.\n\nThe most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year.\n\nAs Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires.\n\nOprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee \"The Nickel Boys\" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont.\n\nThis year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful \"Hamnet,\" and James Cameron, director of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\n\nThe Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires.\n\nEach year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters.\n\nThe tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members.\n\nWarren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave.\n\nThe general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system.\n\nEvery year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nDubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters.\n\nWhile the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers.\n\nThe event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission.\n\nWhile billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\"The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup,\" Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nThe soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market.\n\nWhile the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool.\n\nThere will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal.\n\nPrivate jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference.\n\nSince 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett.\n\nThe conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995.\n\nLast year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced.\n\nThe vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing.\n\nBurning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades.\n\nGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019.\n\nLast year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years.\n\nStill, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way.\n\nThis year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project.\n\nThe coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys.\n\nThe 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons.\n\nLast year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million.\n\nIn the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show.\n\nThe Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800.\n\nOctober presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections.\n\nFirst, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there.\n\nShortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit.\n\nLast year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill.\n\nA painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps.\n\nWhile the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs.\n\nFormula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades.\n\nThe racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures.\n\nThe various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names.\n\nLast year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll.\n\nThree-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options.\n\nWhile Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year.\n\nLast year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club.\n\nFor those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"",

    "title": "What it's like working as a private jet flight attendant who makes over $100,000 a year",
    "description": "Private jet flight attendant Kelley Lokensgard earns over $100,000 and travels the world for essentially free. But it is a lot of work and long hours.",
    "fullText": "\"I grocery shop the night before, then arrive two hours before the flight; I load my flower arrangements, prep my boarding appetizers, and touch up the cabin,\" Lokensgard, the chief cabin attendant at Silver Air Private Jets, told Business Insider. \"People don't realize how many fingerprints they leave behind.\"\n\nThat behind-the-scenes work is part of serving wealthy vacationers, business executives, and celebrities who expect flawless service and discretion.\n\nLokensgard, what started in 2021, said the job can be nonstop: she's on duty for up to 21 days a month, sometimes at a moment's notice, and is responsible for catering meals and tailoring each flight to client preferences.\n\nThis is a level of invisible labor that few people outside private aviation ever see; it's not the glitz and glamour that social media often portrays. But Lokensgard — whose background is in music, youth education, and fine dining — said she loves the grind.\n\n\"It's a lot of schlepping and problem-solving and delicate communication with a lot of moving parts and people; you have to be a laborer to want to do this job,\" she said. \"I can't imagine something that better suits my random scope of skills.\"\n\nPrivate flight attendants are a small but growing niche within aviation. Jobs, which are largely non-union, span from small and medium-sized private companies like Silver Air to mega operators like NetJets and VistaJet.\n\nWhile many roles offer full-time benefits, as in Lokensgard's case, others resemble gig work, which can allow for a flexible lifestyle but often comes with less predictability and fewer labor protections than at most US airlines.\n\nThe work often involves long, irregular hours, extended travel, and the demands of high-profile clients. And private flight attendants usually don't have access to the free standby flights that commercial crew typically enjoy — meaning they only fly if a seat is available.\n\nStill, there's a significant payoff. Lokensgard gets to see the world through the destinations of her clients — essentially for free — while earning much more than most of her airline counterparts.\n\nLokensgard, who lives in Los Angeles, earns in the low six figures, though she said some veteran, freelance, and specially skilled VIP cabin attendants can make as much as $350,000 annually. Glassdoor puts the nationwide median annual salary at about $94,000.\n\nTo prepare for her role, Lokensgard completed five days of training and an online course: \"There was so much to learn, it's professionalism, luxury, service, and safety,\" she said. Silver Air also sponsored culinary classes.\n\nHer training is far shorter than the weekslong courses commercial flight attendants must complete, though that's because the Federal Aviation Administration does not regulate corporate cabin attendant positions — its \"flight attendant\" rules apply to airlines and public charters, not private jets.\n\nThis means cabin training varies widely across private operators, though Lokensgard, as chief attendant, said she is incorporating more shadow flying and collaborative learning at her company.\n\nLokensgard spends most of her days on the Gulfstream G550, a giant multimillion-dollar private jet with a bedroom and enough range to travel across oceans and continents. The plane has an owner but is also managed by Silver Air as a rental; Lokensgard serves whoever is on board.\n\nShe said these often long flights mean she is away from home for days at a time and must work early and late hours. A flight from the Los Angeles-area Van Nuys Airport to Tokyo, for example, would take about 11 hours and involve at least two meal services, she said.\n\nLokensgard must organize catering for the passengers, but is regularly asked to cook. She'll meal-prep meats and vegetables the night before and has access to an approved skillet, oven, microwave, and chiller to work with on the plane.\n\n\"Sometimes our clients don't want catering, and I will be told, 'Hey, arrange steak, sushi, chicken tenders, french fries, salads, fruit platter, snacks, and desserts for the flight,'\" she said. \"I'll shop at Erewhon, or I'll ask a local steakhouse to sear a steak that I'll finish off on the plane. Your head just explodes with ideas.\"\n\nErewhon is the US' most expensive grocery store and a hotspot for the LA elite.\n\nBesides food service, Lokensgard said she must also perform safety checks, prepare meals for the pilots, and make the bed, among other duties. She added that there is surprisingly little time to rest, even on ultra-long-haul flights.\n\nOn the ground, Lokensgard is responsible for tasks like dishes, dry cleaning, and arranging catering for the next trip. After international flights, everyone clears customs, and Lokensgard must follow agricultural rules when disposing of food and trash.\n\nRest policies vary by operator. Lokensgard said her crew gets at least a day of rest after long-haul international flights; previously, Silver Air cabin attendants often finished such trips only to almost immediately hop on a commercial flight home. She receives a minimum of 10 hours of rest after shorter flights.\n\nLokensgard added that it sometimes makes more logistical sense for the crew to stay with the plane for a few days in its destination, giving her extra time to explore places ranging from major cities like London, New York City, and Nice to quaint ski towns in Austria.\n\n\"I make the most of it since we're sacrificing time away from our families and communities,\" she said. \"We explore, see museums, and eat amazing food.\" She also dedicates time to cultivating relationships with local chefs in the cities she visits for catering needs.\n\nOnce home, Lokensgard said the first thing she does is wash her clothes and repack her suitcase, adding that she keeps a spare uniform in her car: \"I have my road wardrobe and toiletries and my home ones.\"\n\nThat constant readiness is essential in private aviation.\n\nFor example, on one reserve day — when she's on standby for last-minute flights — Lokensgard was called at 6 a.m. for a flight that had to take off by 8:30 a.m. But the plane was departing from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, at least 30 minutes from the crew's Manhattan hotel.\n\n\"We're ripping back the covers and packing our bags,\" she said. \"We're calling to get the fuel trucks ready; I'm DoorDashing food to the airport and studying the client's eight-page portfolio, but we were in the air by 8:26 a.m. That really built trust with the client.\"",

    "title": "I used to think hobbies were for losers. Then I built my life around one.",
    "description": "The best way to save your career from the white-collar apocalypse: Get a hobby.",
    "fullText": "There's something offensive about the word \"hobby.\" It evokes images of building model train towns in a basement, poorly crocheting a potholder, or, even worse, playing pickleball. Hobbies are for people who instead of pursuing a rewarding career settled for tinkering, toying, and toddling. Or so I thought until I realized that getting a hobby is probably the best thing you could ever do for your one sweet life — especially if you let it take over your life.\n\nI used to feel sad for hobby people. Unlike them, I carried the burden of dreaming of being a capital W Writer. Shortly after arriving to New York City in my early twenties, I unceremoniously dropped off a bag of all my knitting supplies at Goodwill. No time for that. I lived by a routine that would ensure my success: I worked my nine to five in advertising, and then wrote freelance stories in the mornings, evenings, and on weekends. There was even a six month stretch where I had a breaking news reporter gig on top of my day job, working from 6 to midnight.\n\nI burnt out, obviously. The bigger problem was that my end goal continually shape-shifted. First, I just wanted to get paid for writing. Then I needed to write for more well-respected publications. Then I decided to move to Los Angeles to become a TV writer.\n\nAs I scratched up this neverending ladder, something else was in the back of my mind: trail running. During the early days of COVID I had read Chris McDougall's memoir \"Born To Run\" and become fascinated with the stories of people who could run 100 miles, on trails, over mountains. These hardcore runners seemed alive and free, like hyper-athletic hippies who had completely unsubscribed to the traditional career-oriented lifestyle. They showed me it was possible to have goals that were entirely within my control. I realized how much vaster my dreams for my life could be.\n\nI started running after work in Griffith Park, trying to get a bit further up the steep 3-mile trail to the Observatory without walking. At first, I couldn't even get up the road into the park without stopping to catch my breath. Over the course of a few months, my breathing steadied and my calves didn't burn as badly. I studied the greats of the sport, and listened to podcasts with training tips, like how to lean forward as you run uphill. Eventually I could make it all the way to the Observatory — where I'd stop and immediately bend over, catch my breath, look down at the city, and feel a rush of freedom.\n\nI signed up for a 50k trail race (32 miles), the \"entry level\" ultra distance, which to me felt like an impossible feat that made me sick to think about. But as my training intensified, and my weekends started to revolve around getting enough sleep before my long runs, I realized that I felt more engaged with trail running than I had ever felt trying to pitch my pilot to a disinterested literary manager over a Zoom call — because I didn't care what anyone else thought. After workdays dealing with demanding clients and aggressive timelines, running the foothills of Los Angeles felt like playing hooky. I was out of the reach of cell service, spotting rattlesnakes, and peeing behind bushes. I had awoken a more feral, more childlike version of myself, and I was hooked.\n\nThree years later and I've completed trail races ranging from 8 to 100 miles. I use most of my PTO to go on running vacations or attend races. I traded my apartment in Echo Park for a cabin in the foothills of Angeles National Forest. I've abused my toe nails so badly that they've all fallen out and refuse to regrow normally.\n\nI'm far from alone. Lonely, atomized, burnt out America is obsessed with hobbies. \"Grandma hobbies\" are trending. Pickleball is the fastest-growing sport in America. Run clubs are the new dating apps. Chess is in the new nightclub. It's no coincidence this is happening as morale at work is tanking, especially among young people. For the first time in almost 20 years, workers under 35 are more disillusioned with work than those over 35. I got into trail running right as digital media was collapsing; the jobs I had spent my career dreaming of were ceasing to exist, and it felt more fragile than ever to tie my identity and life satisfaction to a job.\n\nMost of us shape our lives around work: We choose a city based on where our industry is, and choose a home with a reasonable commute in mind. In a chaotic job market where workers feel an increasing loss of agency, some of them, myself included, are reclaiming it by shaping their lives around their hobbies instead.\n\nIt's no secret that hobbies are good for us. They reduce stress, help us form social connections, and strengthen our sense of self. For extreme hobbyists, they can shape your entire being.\n\nFor Giaco Furino, a 39-year-old board game enthusiast based in Brooklyn, his hobby literally became work. He's an editor for a tabletop game reviews site, on top of his fulltime job.\n\n\"I wake up at six and I'm taking photos of a board game for my review,\" he tells me. \"After work I'm trying to get people together to play a game or I'm playing games solo to get the feel of them.\"\n\nBut Furino isn't doing it for the money, and doesn't have aspirations to turn this gig into his full-time work. He took the job to codify his passion for board games into his daily life. The job, he says, \"has done exactly what I wanted it to do, which was cram gaming into every non-work moment.\"\n\nAs he sees it, free time is water, and it's up to us to choose the shape of the vessel we put our water in. \"I could make the shape of that vessel sitting on the couch watching TV for three hours,\" he says. \"Or the shape of that vessel could be getting people together to play a board game. And one of those may be a little bit more difficult to do … but it's so much more rewarding.\"\n\nThis is a common feeling among hardcore hobbyists: a sense that if you aren't vigilant, your free time will slip through your fingers, or get snatched back by your employer.\n\nHumans didn't always think of leisure as pure relaxation. Brad Aeon, Ph.D., a consultant who specializes in productivity and time management, tells me that in Ancient Greece \"leisure time\" consisted of activities like public debate, philosophy and astronomy. \"Things that were demanding mentally,\" he adds.\n\nIn 2026, we're almost certainly not at the zenith of our leisure powers. We know scrolling is bad for us and we need to take breaks from work to avoid burnout. But taking a week off and expecting leisure to come naturally sets us up for feeling guilty and twitchy — because we have no clue what to do to enjoy our time away from work, Aeon explains. \"If you spend your entire time working, that means you haven't spent the time to build hobbies and leisure time that feels absorbing.\"\n\nBecause we're so work-obsessed, reshaping your life around a hobby instead can feel counter-cultural. Mary Beth Yale, a 36-year-old sales executive in Los Angeles recalls a few months into learning to surf in Mexico when a more experienced surfer warned her, \"Now that you can surf, you won't be able to live away from the water.\"\n\nAt the time, she didn't really know what he meant. But a few years later his premonition came true: Today Yale lives a half block from the beach in Venice. \"I arranged my life for surfing convenience,\" she tells me.\n\nThis isn't a lifestyle that Yale thought was available to her when she was younger. \"Our mom is an excellent skier, but never centered her life around skiing,\" she says. Yale's mom focused her life around raising a family outside Dallas, and put her own hobbies on the backburner. Three years ago, when Yale decided she wanted to leave Mexico City and move to somewhere she could surf every day, her sister asked her why she needed to surf so often.\n\n\"I was like, 'well, why can't I?' And there wasn't a very good counter argument.\"\n\nNot everyone understands such intense dedication to a hobby over a career, and it frequently draws concern and confusion from friends and family members. Moving to Mexico during the pandemic is what gave Yale a new approach to identity that wasn't built around work. She didn't have to work as much because her lifestyle was cheaper. And in Mexico, \"What do you do for work?\" wasn't the first question people asked — which was disorienting at first. \"I was like, 'I don't know who I am if I'm not a marketing girl,'\" she tells me.\n\nYale is still passionate about her career. But these days she gets up at 5:30 to surf, walk her dog, and see her friends on the beach, all before work. \"It gives me this sense of ownership over my life that — regardless of what my job is or what's going on — I've already enjoyed myself and gotten to do exactly what I feel like I'm supposed to be doing.\"\n\nEvery dedicated hobbyist I spoke to brought up this value of agency. At a time when bosses are ramping up a hardcore work culture, white-collar job security grows more precarious, and Slack messages are sent at all hours of the day, a hobby is a resistance, a reset, and maybe even a way to reenergize your career.\n\nAndy Pearson, 41, is a fellow runner who has completed over a dozen 100-mile races. He's also the VP of creative at Liquid Death, where he produces award-winning creative campaigns for the $1.4-billion water brand, and travels the world speaking at conferences and industry events. In his twenties, he says, he was working for an infamously demanding agency and didn't take a single day off, including weekends, during his first five months on the job. He took up ultrarunning as \"an equally extreme thing to my extreme job,\" he tells me.\n\nThe counterbalance helped Pearson carve back time in his life in a way that perhaps pickup basketball wouldn't. In a strange way, he says, \"they kind of helped cancel each other out.\"\n\nSome people assume hobby obsessives are addicted to self improvement. But hobbies aren't just an activity — they grant us entry into niche worlds, each with their own culture, history, science, and drama. When we take up a hobby, we can return to its world simply by thinking about it. Yale introduces me to the term \"mind surfing\" which she describes as \"the surfing that happens out of the water.\" She's in the midst of planning a dream surf vacation to Indonesia, and has surf podcasts she listens to regularly. \"It almost makes the world 4D,\" she says.\n\nSimilarly, Pearson isn't a hardcore fitness enthusiast for the gains. He sees running as a sandbox to play in. \"It's about curiosity, and about 'what happens if I try this?' Or 'what do I see if I get over the top of this mountain?'\"\n\nThese worlds take time to learn, but that's part of the fun. When we treat leisure as something that should be simple and easy, we shortchange ourselves and what we can get out of it.\n\nMy guidance for finding a worthwhile hobby is to identify an activity with lore, history, and key players to follow. You want to be able to fall down the rabbit hole, whether through books, message boards, podcasts, or Instagram follows — something that a kickball league likely doesn't offer, but flyfishing probably does. Second, you want to be able to measure your progress at whatever hobby you choose. There is so much joy and excitement in being a novice and improving quickly, and then later on so much satisfaction with smaller, subtler growth. Third, my personal preference is to choose a hobby that requires a little gear but not too much. Learning about which yarn and needles you like to knit on, or which trail running shoes make you feel light on your feet is all part of the fun, and spending money on a hobby feels wholesome in a way other retail therapy doesn't.\n\nThough I'm now fully on the hobby train, \"hobby\" still feels diminutive for how seriously I take trail running. But as someone who excels at ruining the things she loves by being overly competitive about them, I like that the word reminds me of the role I want running to play in my life. I don't want running to become my job. Calling it my \"hobby\" helps me safeguard my fun, without discouraging myself from giving it my very best.\n\nMost surprisingly, going all-in on trail running is what helped me embrace and level up my career. Once I was no longer spending all my free time lusting after a specific version of a writing career, I looked around and realized my job as a creative director in the advertising industry is … pretty fun! Inspired by the curiosity and whimsy with which I approached trail running, I started to take the same approach with advertising and video production — treating it as a niche world to explore versus a test to pass. I decided to become a manager, started reading the trades more closely, and took time to seek out creative inspiration and share it with my coworkers. At the same time, running put healthy boundaries on my work and the role it plays in my self-esteem.\n\nIn the last year, I've even returned to my old hobby I once swore off: knitting. I've acquired an ever-expanding bag of knitting supplies, and sometimes I have a hard time pulling myself away from my knitting to go out for a run. I used to be someone who didn't know who they'd be without work. Now I'm amassing so many hobbies that work is simply what I do when I'm not doing my hobbies. My hobbies have taught me that I'm going to be really good at retiring.\n\nCatherine LeClair is a writer, runner and creative director living in California.",

    "description": "New data showed which sectors added more jobs than others in 2025. Healthcare had a lot of job growth, while the federal government lost a lot.",
    "fullText": "Friday's December employment report — the last for 2025 — reinforced the biggest theme in the job market last year: It's a hard time to be looking for work, unless you're looking at a few select corners of the economy.\n\n\"The job market is ending the year with a fizzle rather than a bang,\" Daniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, said.\n\nIn total, the US added just 584,000 jobs in 2025, a big drop from the past few years. Job growth has been unequal across the economy, as growth in just a few sectors masks the weakness undergirding the rest of the economy. For those in healthcare and social assistance, prospects had been rosy: The sectors added more than 700,000 jobs together in 2025. But it's more of a reckoning for those in government, professional and business services, and manufacturing. Those three sectors were among the ones that had fewer jobs than a year ago.\n\nIt's a sign of how uneven the job market has become, and it shows why job searches have become so frustrating for many on the hunt.\n\n\"There wasn't a single month in 2025 where we added as many jobs as we did on average in 2024,\" Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said.\n\nHere are the bright spots and darker areas of the long-frozen job market of 2025.\n\nHealthcare continues to shine amid the general job market dreariness, holding strong throughout the year.\n\nThe healthcare sector accounted for 69% of the growth in 2025, with job growth of over 100,000 in ambulatory healthcare services, over 100,000 in hospitals, and about 84,000 in nursing and residential care facilities, reflecting that healthcare job growth hasn't been concentrated in just one area.\n\nIt's a sector that's likely to continue growing; in an August 2025 report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that healthcare and social assistance would have both the largest job growth and the fastest growth rate out of all sectors. BLS chalked that up to the needs of an aging population and the rise of chronic conditions — all of which require more workers to take care of growing numbers of patients.\n\nLeisure and hospitality also added a good number of roles, although that sector tends to have quite a bit of turnover. Social assistance, however, remains a key jobs engine: After recovering in 2022 from pandemic-related job loss, the sector didn't stop growing. Individual and family services added about 289,000 jobs in 2025.\n\nWhile healthcare workers are still in demand, it might not be an easy job switch; many types of healthcare work require certain skills and years of education.\n\n\"It's not necessarily really easy for people to snap their fingers and switch from working in manufacturing to healthcare, for example,\" Ullrich previously told Business Insider.\n\nThe new report showed federal employment fell by 274,000 this past December from a year prior, which Zhao said meant the largest single-year drop since 1946, just after World War II. It's also comparable to the job loss in 1953, when the Korean War was winding down.\n\nThe federal government workforce weathered a lot of change in 2025: People were offered — and many ended up taking — a deferred resignation package to voluntarily leave their roles. At the same time, agencies like the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration moved to cut jobs, leading some workers to end up in employment limbo as the courts ruled on those layoffs, and others ultimately lost their roles.\n\n\"The president promised to right-size the federal government. What you saw is exactly that — a downsize of the federal government and a increase in private sector jobs,\" Department of Labor Deputy Secretary Keith Sonderling told Business Insider.\n\nMeanwhile, some other white-collar sectors experienced job loss last year. The professional and business services sector lost 97,000 payrolls, with employment in temporary help services falling by 99,200. That loss in temporary help services isn't as large as it had been in the previous few years.\n\nUllrich said white-collar softness could be due to businesses shifting investments to AI as opposed to head count, economic uncertainty, and overhiring a few years ago, leading to less of a need for new employees.\n\nGuy Berger, senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute, said in a LinkedIn post that young people have carried most of the pain of a slow market. \"And not just young people with college degrees — it's also high school grads and people with associate degrees,\" he said.\n\nAaron Terrazas, an independent economist, expects this year to be a little bit easier for job searching, partly because employers won't be dealing with the uncertainty of what a new administration could bring.\n\n\"It's not that uncertainty has cleared up, but people are just having to make decisions because they have to be made,\" Terrazas said. \"We're going to see more investment, more business plans being laid, and ultimately I think that will lead to some degree of more robust job creation.\"\n\nAnother bright spot: Berger told Business Insider said he doesn't think the newly released report indicates a recession is on the horizon and instead lowers the odds for one in the near term.\n\n\"The labor market has cooled a little over the past six months — mostly via weak hiring,\" Berger said.\n\nInstead, the next year might just be slow and steady. \"The job market, in some ways, is like someone recovering from a ski accident — eventually you get better, but you never quite get back fully to where you were before,\" Terrazas said.\n\nAre you a job seeker with a story to share?

    "title": "I quit my job at JPMorgan to run a restaurant group with my dad. It's the best decision I've ever made.",
    "description": "Kassidy Angelo left her finance job to run a restaurant group with her dad, and said it set a strong foundation for her as an entrepreneur.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kassidy Angelo, a 25-year-old managing director at Gioia Hospitality Group in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI never imagined myself entering the restaurant business at the age of 24. I majored in American Studies at Georgetown University with the hope of attending law school.\n\nInstead of pursuing a law career, I decided to apply for finance jobs and eventually landed an internship at JPMorgan in New York. Ultimately, I became an analyst in Miami, but I quit after two years.\n\nMy dad, an attorney by trade and restaurateur for many years, asked me if I'd ever consider partnering with him on a new venture. He already owned successful restaurants, and I thought this was a unique opportunity to learn from him and pursue my own entrepreneurial path. It's the best decision I have ever made.\n\nTogether, my dad and I are attempting to create a new world-class dining experience from the ground up, Daniel's Steakhouse, in Fort Lauderdale. My dad is 62 years old and already owns several other successful restaurants, so he doesn't really need to build this brand for himself.\n\nWorking with him, I can gain hands-on experience alongside someone who has already mastered the art of entrepreneurship. We've always had a close relationship, and I've long admired his work ethic; however, I wasn't sure how it would feel to work side by side, day in and day out.\n\nBefore I left my job at JPMorgan, we had a long conversation about expectations and how we wouldn't only build a strong professional relationship but also maintain the personal closeness we had created throughout my life. He's an amazing dad and has become an incredible business partner.\n\nWorking in finance is always a great opportunity to seize. It helped me become more financially literate and gave me a lot of experience working with all types of people.\n\nUltimately, you're in a client service role. Private finance, especially, is a people business. Every single day, I communicated with clients, assistants, coworkers, and others, and ultimately, I learned to work as part of a team and how to correspond effectively with high-net-worth individuals. But working in finance has a lot of pressures too.\n\nThe analyst role at JPMorgan is intended to be a two-year program. When the opportunity to work with my father came up, I had to make a decision: stay for the full two years and then make the leap, or leave to go through the process of a true restaurant opening.\n\nUltimately, I realized that if I were going to pursue a career in the restaurant industry, learning the ins and outs of an opening would be the best way to truly understand the business. I viewed it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity not only to work with my dad, but to build something from the ground up.\n\nWorking with family has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. One of the biggest pros is the amount of quality time I get to spend with my father. He understands my day-to-day, where my head is at, and where I may be struggling, and he's always in my corner — not just as a resource, but as a true partner.\n\nIn terms of cons, I wouldn't say there's anything inherently negative, but it can sometimes be hard to find the \"off button.\" Family dinners, vacations, and time away often circle back to conversations about how we can improve and grow the business.\n\nI entered the restaurant industry with less experience, but more authority than I had as an analyst, which is the bottom of the totem pole in finance. Having worked with senior management at JPMorgan, I had the confidence to run the restaurant.\n\nI also believe it was important that I worked for someone else before working with my dad. It taught me how to take constructive criticism, recognize my shortcomings, and develop confidence outside of my family's influence. On my first day at the restaurant, I learned how to run the door, be a hostess, serve, and run private events. Now, I'm mentoring a woman who works for us, and I work six days a week on the floor, overseeing everything that goes into running a restaurant.\n\nWhile there may not be the same financial benefits in the short term, and I must work holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, being an entrepreneur allows me to work and live in my home city.\n\nWorking at JPMorgan immediately after graduating gave me an instant sense of accomplishment. On the other hand, joining a family business at its foundation was a bigger risk — but one that has been incredibly fulfilling.\n\nI never like to say never to going back to finance, but I truly believe I've found my calling in the hospitality world, and doing it alongside my dad makes it even more meaningful.\n\nDo you work with a family member and want to share your story?

    "description": "\"No matter how much you increase your income, you have to avoid lifestyle creep — otherwise you're not actually going to make progress.\"",
    "fullText": "When Michela Allocca began working in the corporate world, she was quickly disillusioned.\n\nThe finance major, who graduated in 2017, started her career as a business analyst at John Hancock. Two years later, she transitioned to working at an investment consulting firm.\n\n\"It was my proverbial dream job,\" the 30-year-old told Business Insider. \"I thought that that was going to be the job for me, and once I got into it, I realized, not only do I hate this, but I also hate this industry. I don't see a growth path forward that makes sense for me.\"\n\nContent creation wasn't exactly a great fit on paper for an \"analytical kind of person,\" as Allocca describes herself. \"I went to school for finance. I had finance jobs. I don't have the eye for design.\"\n\nHowever, encouraged by a friend who was building a social media following in the health and fitness space, Allocca began posting about personal finance, a topic her friends were increasingly asking her advice on.\n\n\"I was like, 'OK, she's making money talking about health and fitness online. Why don't I just give this a go and see if I could ultimately turn it into anything?'\" said Allocca, who started her brand on Instagram in 2019. \"For the first year or so, nothing really came of it. I used it as a creative outlet to find satisfaction outside of my job.\"\n\nAllocca's side project, Break Your Budget, gained momentum when she expanded to TikTok, which surged in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShe benefited from timing. In 2020, the discoverability was higher because there were fewer creators on the platform, she said.\n\nPlus, \"there were not a lot of women talking about personal finance online, especially in their mid-twenties, so I didn't have a ton of competition. But I think another layer was the delivery — what I was talking about and how I talked about it.\"\n\nShe focused on creating the kind of content that she personally would want as a woman navigating money in her 20s: easy-to-understand, actionable advice.\n\n\"It was so, so simple and straightforward,\" she said. \"And I do think that really resonated with people.\"\n\nAfter growing from a few hundred followers in 2019 to about 1,000 in 2020, her audience snowballed to more than 200,000 by 2021. That's when brands began reaching out about partnerships.\n\nIn the early days, brands offered about $1,000 for a TikTok video plus a link in bio. If she booked one partnership a week, \"that was essentially matching my corporate income,\" said Allocca, who also launched a budgeting template that she sold through her link in bio.\n\nAs sales and brand deals stacked up, the additional income started to feel substantial.\n\nThe momentum continued through the end of 2021. That year, she said she made about $100,000 from Break Your Budget. It was more than she earned from her day job, and it gave her the confidence to walk away from corporate America. She went full time with Break Your Budget in April 2022. Since then, she's quadrupled her former corporate income.\n\nToday, Allocca's income is split roughly evenly between two main revenue streams: About 50% comes from brand and finance partnerships, which tend to pay more but are less predictable. The other 50% comes from digital products, including her expense tracker and financial independence calculator, which provide recurring monthly income.\n\nMore recently, she's added affiliate income and YouTube AdSense, which made up about 10% of her income last year.\n\nDespite her increased earnings, Allocca said she hasn't changed her lifestyle — and that's been key to growing her wealth: \"No matter how much you increase your income, you have to avoid lifestyle creep — otherwise you're not actually going to make progress.\"\n\nWhile working her corporate job and building Break Your Budget on the side, she didn't use any of her business income to cover day-to-day expenses. Instead, she invested it: \"If I was making, say, $4,000 a month from brand deals and put $1,000 aside for taxes, that other $3,000 was going into my Roth IRA and into a brokerage account. I didn't touch it.\"\n\nAnd when she quit her job in 2022 and her income 4x'ed, she kept her spending largely unchanged, even though she could afford to spend much more.\n\nHer investment strategy is simple: She focuses first on maxing out her retirement accounts, which are invested in target-date funds. She invests additional income in a taxable brokerage account, using broad-market index funds and ETFs.\n\n\"There's nothing funky in my portfolio,\" she said. \"I don't have any crypto, I don't own real estate, and I don't plan to in the near future. I'm just trying to get as much money in the market and diversified as I can.\"\n\nShe also keeps about six months' worth of expenses in a high-yield savings account as an emergency fund, along with a small amount of cash earmarked for a potential real estate purchase if the right opportunity arises. Outside of that, nearly all of her money is invested.\n\nBetween her retirement accounts and brokerage account, she has more than seven figures invested, according to screenshots viewed by Business Insider.\n\nUltimately, she attributes her net worth growth to focusing on earning more.\n\n\"The reason I've been able to hit these big numbers is because I increased my income outside my corporate job,\" she said. \"It's not the sexiest thing — not everyone wants a side hustle or to start a business — but that's the big driver.\"",

    "description": "What if a group chat of fellow laid-off Microsoft workers helped you find your next job? Job seekers are finding solidarity — and new gigs.",
    "fullText": "After being laid off from his AI product manager role last September, one of Aman Goyal's first moves in a tough job market was to buy a book.\n\nWith the 26-year-old's purchase of \"Decode and Conquer,\" author Lewis Lin provided Goyal with access to a private Slack community with more than 20,000 professionals and job seekers.\n\nOver the next six weeks, Goyal conducted about 40 mock interviews through the community with fellow job seekers, some of them current product managers from major tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon. Goyal said the practice helped him prepare for interviews at T-Mobile, where he accepted an offer in November.\n\n\"I think it's a good community for you to practice and also find some good network connections,\" said Goyal, who lives in Seattle. \"The mock interviews helped with my confidence and just building that muscle of answering those questions spontaneously.\"\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken with more than a dozen people who have found ways to turn job searching into a group project. While networking is a time-tested job search strategy, these job seekers have taken it a step further: forming layoff support groups, joining exclusive networking circles, or turning to social media for feedback and encouragement.\n\nThey hoped the added support would help them break through in a market that has grown more challenging in recent years, with employers now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nWhen Sreeja Apparaju began looking for a job in the fall of 2022, she turned to her most trusted network — a close circle of four friends.\n\nAfter the University of California, Berkeley students realized they were applying to many of the same software engineering roles, they decided to join forces: trading job leads and recruiter contacts, swapping interview tips, and offering each other moral support along the way.\n\nApparaju said the collaboration helped her land two interviews — and ultimately, a job offer. In one case, a friend told her about a role at Palantir they'd interviewed for and shared the recruiter's email. Within a week of reaching out, Apparaju received an online assessment that led to an interview with the company. In another instance, a friend's cousin provided a referral for a software engineering role at Snap — the company behind Snapchat — where Apparaju later received and accepted an offer.\n\nHer friends also found success, with one landing a role at Amazon and another joining Salesforce.\n\n\"There can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of people,\" said the 24-year-old, who lives in New York. \"But in my experience, just sharing what you know and helping each other out was a lot easier and faster for all five of us.\"\n\nLooking for work alongside your closest friends is an experience that's arguably unique to a college senior. But outside that bubble, some job seekers are finding new ways to make their searches more collaborative.\n\nAfter 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Henderson was laid off from her user researcher role last May. After learning the news, she messaged colleagues to see who else had been affected and added them to a group chat. Over the following weeks, more than a dozen people shared job leads, helped one another prepare for interviews, vented frustrations, and celebrated successes.\n\n\"The fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful,\" she said. In August, Henderson accepted an offer for a user experience role at Meta — a position she learned about through her network and was referred for.\n\nIn the absence of formal support networks, some job seekers have turned to social platforms for help. That includes career-focused sites like LinkedIn, where many have publicly announced layoffs or added \"open to work\" badges — as well as broader platforms like TikTok.\n\nLast May, Andrew Z. Chen was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. So when Amazon invited him to interview for a software engineering role, he didn't want to waste the opportunity. His plan: hole up in his room to study — and document the process on TikTok to hold himself accountable.\n\nChen said the videos — which racked up as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions. Some viewers were skeptical he could land the role given his limited prep time. But others, including people who'd interviewed at Amazon, offered encouragement and shared advice on the types of technical questions to expect.\n\n\"The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement,\" said Chen, who's in his 20s and lives in New York.\n\nWeeks later, he accepted the role at Amazon.\n\nSupport from others navigating the job market has helped some job seekers stay motivated; however, many are still struggling to secure job offers.\n\nLast July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off from his developer relations role at Intel. He's struggled to find work, but said he's leaned on the support of former Intel colleagues who were laid off around the same time — and has helped some of them land interviews.\n\n\"Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support,\" said Ramkrishna, who is in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. \"It feels like we're all looking out for each other.\"\n\nBeyond those connections, Ramkrishna said he's also leaned on private developer relations Slack channels and Discord servers he was invited to through conferences and past professional relationships. Some include job-specific channels where hiring managers post openings directly, he said.\n\nApparaju said that while securing her role ultimately came down to how she performed in the interviews, the support of her friends helped her stay focused and confident throughout the process.\n\n\"Having people who were cheering for you and also working hard with you was honestly so motivating,\" she said. \"Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was an inspiration to keep pushing to crack that one job offer.\"\n\nApparaju knows she'll never be able to replicate her college experience of job hunting alongside close friends, but she believes her network can still be valuable. She recently mentioned some potential openings at her company to a friend — one example, she said, of how she can keep that spirit of support alive.\n\n\"Given how tough this job market is, everybody and anybody is super happy to help,\" she said.",

    "title": "Why 'Big Short' trader Danny Moses thinks investors need to pay close attention to prediction markets",
    "description": "You can bet on anything from sports to Labubus now, but prediction markets are also a valuable tool for investors, Danny Moses told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "You can bet on pretty much anything these days. From sports to the weather to the price of a Labubu, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi have offered people a new way to gamble.\n\nAccording to Danny Moses, one of the investors from \"The Big Short,\" they've also offered investors a useful tool to help navigate markets.\n\nMoses, who was among the investors betting against the US housing market ahead of the 2008 crash, isn't surprised by the prediction-market boom, and he thinks investors need to be watching these markets closely to stay on top of their game.\n\n\"I think it's great to scan through all the prediction markets out there, certainly economics and business-related, because it actually will get you thinking about things you might have been missing,\" he told Business Insider in an interview before the new year.\n\nMoses isn't too focused on short opportunities these days, despite being famous for his role in Michael Lewis's now-iconic saga of the housing crash. But he thinks that prediction markets can serve to provide valuable info for bullish and bearish investors alike.\n\nHe pointed to the recent example of popular fintech stock SoFi Technologies being listed as having a 38% chance of being added to the benchmark index in 2026, something that could be a likely catalyst for the stock, which is up 93% in the last year.\n\n\"If you're short SoFi and you weren't thinking about the possibility of it being added to the S&P 500, like we just saw happen to Carvana recently, that's something you need to be aware of,\" Moses said.\n\nThat's not the only way prediction markets could help investors make smarter decisions. Moses said he thinks there may be circumstances where they can offer a more appealing risk-reward than investors might get from traditional derivatives. He cited crypto as an example.\n\n\"Will bitcoin trade below $70,000 in the first quarter of 2026?\" he mused. \"Well, if I own bitcoin, and it's a much cheaper way to bet, if it's an eight cent possibility, so call it twelve to one, I might be getting a better market, or I might want to buy that rather than buying a put option on crypto.\"\n\nIn his view, it's early days for prediction markets. Their usefulness will grow as a predictive tool for hedging traditional investments as well as gauging the likelihood of market-moving events. And as they grow, expect more prominent players to participate, he said.\n\n\"I think institutions are going to start using prediction markets more, and as institutions use it, you're going to see a lot more activity,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "What began as weed crumbs mixed into water is becoming a go-to drink of choice for adults who want a different kind of buzz than alcohol offers.\n\nNowadays, a leading THC beverage brand, was founded in March 2023 by Anthony Puterman and CEO Justin Tidwell. Less than three years later, its popularity has exploded, with sales jumping 270% in the first half of 2025 from the same period in 2024, the company said.\n\n\"We went from this is a cool pet project to something where we see a massive consumer demand,\" Tidwell told Business Insider.\n\nNowadays has built up quite the following, which Tidwell says is mostly made up of adult women of varying ages. From Gen Zers drinking less to boomers looking for alcohol alternatives, Tidwell said Nowadays' customer base is mainly 25 to 65 years old. The category's growth is encouraging bars and restaurants to adopt non-alcoholic cocktails to their menus, he said.\n\nThe non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits category grew 22% year over year by August, according to data NIQ, which cited cannabis use as one of the reasons for the uptick in sales. The hemp THC beverage sector, which includes Nowadays, was valued at $93 million in 2025, Jason Zelinski, vice president of convenience in North America at NIQ, said.\n\nHowever, that growth is under threat in 2026 as new federal limitations on certain THC products loom. A bill that is set to go into effect in November would restrict legal hemp products, such as Nowadays, to 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container.\n\nNowadays' drinks range from 2 to 10 milligrams per container.\n\nTidwell said his business and others like his could \"literally go to zero.\" That is, if he can't convince lawmakers to change the bill by November.\n\n\"Half of my job the next year goes from growing the business and focusing on the brand to talking to regulators in Washington, DC,\" Tidwell told Business Insider in a December interview.\n\nHe said he supports regulating THC-infused products to determine where, how, and to whom they should be sold. His industry has less than a year to convince the government to rethink how it regulates products like Nowadays, so they can be sold safely at liquor stores, restaurants, and events.\n\nIn the meantime, Nowadays is continuing to expand its business with new formulas, like limited-edition seasonal flavors such as lemonade and cranberry. It's also trying to introduce itself to more potential customers through events, such as its recent exclusive sponsorship of the Electric Daisy Carnival, or EDC for short.\n\nMeanwhile, drinking hit a record low in 2025, analytics firm Gallup wrote in a report published in August. The share of adults who say they consume alcohol has seen consecutive declines over the years, dropping to 54% in Gallup's survey.\n\nTidwell gave viral TikTok videos that introduced the concept of a THC drink with taste tests and cocktail recipes credit for Nowadays early success, which saw it go from an idea in his kitchen to a booming alcohol alternative that could help get you through dry January.",

    "description": "Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy says that people either overhype the impact of AI, or assume doomsday scenarios.",
    "fullText": "AI often sparks strong reactions, with people predicting either a near-term utopia — or the end of the world as we know it.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told Business Insider that individuals on the hype end of the spectrum tend to jump quickly to promises of unlimited prosperity. The CEO said that the other extreme includes those who believe AI will lead to a doomsday scenario.\n\nRamaswamy said that this sort of thinking is \"very human,\" but that neither of those scenarios is \"all that likely.\"\n\n\"The biggest misconception would be that of thinking about AI as an all or nothing,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nThe real value of AI, he said, is likely to be nuanced and show up in specific use cases. Ramaswamy added that his advice to customers is to \"be very incremental\" with AI adoption.\n\nWhile he's still focused on long-term thinking, he added that he no longer accepts multi-year, fixed roadmaps for plans for the company because the technology is changing so quickly.\n\n\"I want them to tell me which direction they are headed, but very much be in this mode of iterating, because this is a world of rapid change,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nRather than view AI as a tool that will bring sweeping changes overnight, the CEO said it needs to be embraced as a shift in how people work, and one that requires progress \"bit by bit.\" He added that clear frameworks are necessary to determine where AI efforts matter the most.\n\nFor example, a cloud data platform company like Snowflake focuses on building and running software, and Ramaswamy said it needs to \"nail\" how it creates, deploys, sells, and installs that software. That means it needs to deeply integrate AI in software development to stay competitive.\n\nWhile Ramaswamy said he wants his employees to utilize AI tools daily, his end goal is for the company to write software more efficiently than the rest of the industry. That requires adapting business models in specific areas, rather than treating AI as a blanket rewrite of everything, he said.\n\nHe said that when dealing with technology like AI, which \"ostensibly claims to change everything,\" it's essential to have a clear view on where change needs to be implemented and where the impact will be \"existential.\"\n\n\"I worry a lot about making sure that we are state-of-the-art, especially in the critical areas with regards to how we utilize AI,\" Ramaswamy said.",

    "description": "Since December 5, over 400 student-loan borrowers have shared their stories while gearing up for Trump's major repayment overhaul this year.",
    "fullText": "\"I got student-loan forgiveness!\"\n\n\"I'm working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\"\n\nIn one month, over 400 student-loan borrowers shared their experiences of repayment and relief with me in a brief survey.\n\nEach story was unique and touched on a range of themes, which will feed more in-depth stories on respondents' experiences throughout the year.\n\nAs 2026 shapes up to be a year of turmoil for student-loan borrowers due to President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul, I wanted to start by looking broadly at the main concerns on the minds of those who reached out.\n\nSome borrowers told me that they achieved student-loan forgiveness or repaid their loans in full. However, the majority of respondents reported a range of concerns about the future of their balances, including worries about losing a key affordable repayment plan, struggling to get help from their servicers, being in default on their loans, and more.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation includes the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two less generous options. It also eliminates the SAVE plan, which promised affordable monthly payments with a shorter timeline to debt relief. Nearly half of the survey's respondents said they're enrolled in SAVE.\n\nIf you're interested in sharing your student-loan story and having it highlighted in future coverage, fill out the survey here, and I'll be in touch. Here are some of the main themes that student-loan borrowers have shared so far.\n\nOn December 9, the Department of Education announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan, established by former President Joe Biden. A court has not yet approved the settlement. However, upon approval, the department would not enroll any new borrowers in SAVE, deny pending applications, and move all enrolled borrowers to existing repayment plans.\n\nWhile the department intended to eliminate SAVE by 2028, the settlement accelerates the timeline and would push the 7 million enrolled borrowers into new repayment plans with higher payments sooner than anticipated. Some borrowers in the survey described SAVE as a lifeline for them, and they expressed concerns about their ability to afford higher monthly payments on a new plan.\n\n\"I'm bracing for an astronomical bill,\" Brenda McCoy, a 60-year-old borrower on SAVE, told me.\n\nSome survey respondents said that they had their balances wiped out through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nOver 60 respondents said that they're pursuing PSLF, and while they're at different stages, the majority said that they're concerned about the future of the program. Trump's Department of Education finalized a rule to limit eligibility for PSLF following a March executive order that directed the education secretary to redefine what \"public service\" means.\n\nThe new rule, set to go into effect in July, would exclude employers from PSLF who the department determines to have engaged in \"illegal activities\" that do not align with the administration's views.\n\nRespondents who are pursuing PSLF described feeling like a \"pawn\" and being \"held hostage\" due to the program's uncertainty.\n\nThe consequences of default are also weighing on some borrowers' minds. Beginning January 7, the Department of Education said it would start notifying about 1,000 borrowers in default that their wages will be garnished. It follows the resumption of collections on defaulted student loans in May 2025 after a five-year pause.\n\nOver 5 million borrowers are in default, which typically occurs after a federal borrower hasn't made payments in more than 270 days. Some borrowers in default said they're expecting wage garnishment notices, while those who are not yet in default but are concerned about affording payments said they're worried garnishments are in their future.\n\nBorrowers in default described feeling \"depressed\" and \"anxious\" due to their repayment statuses.\n\nParent PLUS loans allow parents to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their kids' education. It's also facing changes in Trump's spending legislation: the department is planning to impose a $65,000 lifetime borrowing limit per dependent student, which would limit parents' ability to help finance their kids' college experiences.\n\nSome Parent PLUS borrowers said they've been struggling with repayment long before Trump's proposed changes. For example, some are struggling to pay back the loans years after their kids graduated while balancing their own debt and expenses.\n\nParent borrowers described paying more than what they borrowed, with some saying taking out the loans was a \"mistake.\"\n\nIn addition to facing the changing federal student-loan landscape, some survey respondents reported balancing both federal and private student loans. Private student loans often have higher interest rates, and they're not eligible for federal relief programs, such as PSLF.\n\nHowever, some borrowers turn to the private lending market for additional financing, and the Department of Education's new proposed caps on borrowing could lead more borrowers to turn to private student loans to help pay for programs that federal aid would no longer cover.",

    "fullText": "A superyacht broker in Miami says the most fascinating part of his job isn't the boats — it's the people he sells them to.\n\nAJ Blackmon, the CEO of Ikonic Yachts, started out in the industry by washing boats for $3 per foot at a yacht club, wondering what the people who could afford those boats did for a living. Now his company helps the wealthy buy, sell, charter, and manage superyachts, focusing on boats that are bigger than 40 meters, or over 130 feet, and can cost millions.\n\n\"It's one of the most fascinating things on the planet to be around such special people and being able to learn from them, having conversations with them, and getting a glimpse into the world that they live,\" he said.\n\nBlackmon said he thinks the wealthy clients he works with are \"one of the most misunderstood segments of society.\" After years in the business, here are three surprising things he's learned about selling boats to the ultrawealthy.\n\nBlackmon said he's noticed a trend between the ultrawealthy, or those who buy their own superyachts, and those who charter them.\n\n\"The people that you see on very large yachts, 50 meters and up, those are the people that show up with sweatpants on, a T-shirt,\" he said. \"They're not fancy. They don't wear jewelry. They're very low key.\"\n\nOne example he gave was of a client who has a full-time private chef and still shows up to his boat with Shake Shack, looking like a normal guy.\n\nBlackmon said it's the people chartering yachts who are more likely to show up with all the flash and fancy jewelry.\n\n\"True wealth is super quiet and reserved,\" he said.\n\nBuying a superyacht is more about time than status for Blackmon's clients.\n\n\"These yachts aren't just this ego purchase,\" he said. \"It's really an effort to claw back time that they sacrificed to achieve whatever they were in pursuit of.\"\n\nHe said his clients say the rest of their life and stress melts away when they're on their boats, and that it's the rare time they feel they can be present in the moment.\n\nThey use it as a way to spend time with friends and family \"that they've put on hold for the last 30 years while they were building a business,\" Blackmon said.\n\nWhen he first decided to focus on yachts that were at least 40 meters, Blackmon said he worried the market could be too small.\n\n\"In reality, there's a lot of people,\" he said. \"That's what was one of the first eye-opening things for me — there is no shortage of people creating wealth every day.\"\n\nThe result is that the deals between buyers and sellers can be very high stakes, he said, adding that he's often working with people who are at the prime of their careers.\n\nThe booming world of superyachts is often associated with big-name billionaires, but Blackmon has found many of his clients are \"normal people\" who \"were on the right side of a few deals\" or \"believed in themselves longer than anyone else.\"",

    "description": "They sit at the top of one of Wall Street's most prestigious banks at a pivotal moment in its history. Inside Padi and Neema Raphael's rise.",
    "fullText": "One recent afternoon at 200 West Street, Goldman Sachs partner Padi Raphael was walking a client toward the elevator at the bank's New York headquarters when the doors opened. Out stepped Goldman's chief data officer.\n\nThe timing couldn't have been better. The client had been asking for the chance to meet him.\n\nIt also meant Padi was coming face-to-face with the coworker she calls her \"best friend\": her brother.\n\nWhat makes the moment at the elevator so unusual isn't just that Padi and Neema Raphael are siblings. It's that both have risen to become partners at Goldman, placing them among roughly 500 people at a firm of roughly 49,000.\n\nThey now steer parts of the firm that are essential to its future.\n\nPadi, 47, is the global cohead of the third-party wealth business at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, having built her career in markets and client-facing roles across Europe and Asia. She's center ring in a hot sector for the firm, working with broker-dealers, private banks, and investment advisors to attract more wealthy clients.\n\nNeema, 44, rose through the tech business and now leads hundreds of engineers who work on the bank's data and AI systems. His role is central to Goldman's push into artificial intelligence, a priority for CEO David Solomon.\n\n\"Our clients have a huge appetite for hearing his insights on all things data-related,\" Padi told Business Insider in a joint interview with her brother. For years, she joked, Neema was known internally as Padi's younger brother. Now, the shorthand has flipped.\n\nThe elevator encounter captured the unusual convergence of two careers that had spent decades running in parallel — for most of their time at Goldman, the siblings worked in different divisions and on different continents. Only recently did they begin showing up to the same office.\n\nThey shared with Business Insider an intimate look at how they navigated their rise.\n\nThe Raphael siblings grew up in Los Angeles, the children of Iranian immigrants who emphasized the importance of education. Their parents collectively hold three master's degrees and a Ph.D.\n\n\"We made education and learning a priority, and encouraged curiosity, reasoning, and discourse,\" their parents, Nora Ghodsian and Bijan Raphael, said via email.\n\nGrowing up, neither imagined a career in financial services. Padi studied neuroscience at UCLA. Neema went on to study computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPadi arrived at Goldman first, almost by accident. A mentor encouraged her to talk to the firm, telling her it would teach her things she had yet to learn. She joined in 1999 as an analyst, after a hiring process she still remembers as grueling.\n\n\"I'd fly in, do 12 interviews, and then fly back home,\" Padi, who was still living on the West Coast at the time, said. The firm did this three times — more than 30 interviews in total — a process she later suspected was a test of endurance.\n\nShe spent her first year in New York in asset management before relocating to London in 2000, where she moved into equity derivatives sales on the trading floor and built a career there.\n\nA few years later, her brother called.\n\nAfter college, Neema was keen to apply his tech training to a real-world business like Goldman. He asked his sister if she could help him get a foot in the door.\n\nPadi couldn't promise more than introductions, but agreed to circulate his résumé. She also offered advice: \"Be yourself and be thoughtful and show them your work,\" Neema recalled her telling him. He got the job, joining the technology division as an analyst in 2003.\n\nFive years later, at the height of the financial crisis, Neema's team helped Goldman assess its exposure quickly because his team had helped digitize key systems. The effort earned an internal award typically reserved for dealmakers — and cemented his focus on the intersection of data and finance.\n\nEarly in his career, his manager asked if he would consider moving to Tokyo. Unsure what the request meant for his prospects at the bank, Neema called his sister. Her reaction was swift and definitive.\n\n\"You have to do that,\" she told him. \"That's a no-brainer.\"\n\nPadi encouraged him, she said, because she believed that \"any adventure, any opportunity to broaden your perspective about the world, about people, about the business\" was worth taking.\n\nWhile the siblings' careers unfolded in very different parts of the firm, they continued comparing notes. Making partner was the next milestone.\n\nPadi was named a partner in 2016. Her career had taken her from the equities trading floor during the Dot-com bust to returning from maternity leave during the recession, to navigating the European financial crisis in London, and to experiencing the coronavirus pandemic in Hong Kong.\n\nFour years later, it was Neema's turn. He became a partner in 2020, which Padi said marked the first year he was under consideration. The role brought a shift: greater visibility inside a firm where data and technology had become increasingly central.\n\nIn 2022, Padi moved back to New York after nearly a decade in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Coming back home to the US was a natural choice for our growing family,\" she said. And it came as Solomon and his deputy, President and COO John Waldron, were combining Goldman's asset and wealth management businesses. The two leaders were \"seeking to reinforce our asset management business' client leadership group with seasoned partners from around the firm,\" she added.\n\nFor a stretch, Padi and her family stayed with Neema and his family. They often headed to the office together.\n\nOutside work, the siblings' closeness is unmistakable. Padi has three children — two teenagers and a kindergartener — while Neema is raising a young family, including a four-year-old and a newborn. Their kids are best friends, they said, and Friday nights are reserved for Shabbat dinners, with both families gathering to mark the end of the week together.\n\nThat dynamic was on display at Goldman's annual winter gathering in Miami for its global partners, where the firm fills a wall with the names of every partner it has ever named. Like everyone else in attendance, the Raphael siblings went in search of theirs. A stylistic break in the display left Neema's name at the end of one section, and Padi's at the beginning of another.\n\nThey tracked both down and snapped selfies in front of each — a quiet marker of two careers that ran in parallel for two decades before converging at the top.",

    "description": "Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting opposition from tech",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting ​opposition from tech companies, according to four sources, as well as industry and government ‌documents seen by Reuters.\n\nManufacturers must test and provide proprietary source code for review by government-designated labs to ‌identify vulnerabilities in phone operating systems that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nIndustry group MAIT, which represents Apple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi, has told the government this is \"not possible\" due to corporate secrecy and global privacy policies.\n\nBACKGROUND PERMISSION RESTRICTIONS:\n\nApps cannot access cameras, microphones or location services in ⁠the background when phones are inactive. ‌Continuous status bar notifications are required when these permissions are active.\n\nManufacturers say this lacks any global precedent and there is no specific test method ‍prescribed.\n\nDevices must periodically display warnings prompting users to review all app permissions, with continuous notifications. Companies say notice should be limited to \"highly critical\" permissions.\n\nDevices must store security audit logs, including ​app installations and login attempts, for 12 months.\n\nMAIT argues consumer phones lack the storage capacity ‌for a year of data.\n\nPhones must periodically scan for malware and identify potentially harmful applications.\n\nManufacturers warn that constant on-device scanning significantly drains the battery and slows hardware performance.\n\nOPTION TO REMOVE PRE-INSTALLED APPS:\n\nAll pre-installed apps bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions, must be deletable.\n\nCompanies argue many apps are critical system components that cannot be ⁠removed.\n\nINFORMING GOVERNMENT OF MAJOR UPDATES:\n\nPhone makers must notify a ​government organisation before releasing any major updates or security ​patches.\n\nManufacturers argue this is \"impractical\" because security fixes must be released quickly to protect users from active exploits, while government delays could leave users vulnerable.\n\nDevices ‍must detect if phones have ⁠been rooted or \"jailbroken\", where users bypass built-in security restrictions, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures.\n\nCompanies say there is no reliable mechanism to detect jailbreaking.\n\nPhones ⁠must permanently block installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security ‌downgrades.\n\nThere is no global standard related to this requirement, manufacturers say.",

    "title": "He Filed a Permit for an Addition to His Home, Then the City Requested Half His Front Yard",
    "description": "A Miami homeowner says the city wouldn’t approve his permit unless he gave up part of his yard. A new lawsuit says he's one of hundreds.",
    "fullText": "Chad Trausch just wanted to build a small addition to his Miami home. With a baby on the way, he and his wife were making space for her parents to move in and help with child care. But when he submitted the plans, the city hit him with a condition he never expected: If he wanted a permit to build in the backyard, he’d first need to grant the public the right to use half his front yard.\n\nThe city requested that Trausch record a deed dedicating a 10-by-50-foot strip of his property for public use at his own expense. Such a condition would have allowed the city to treat the land as its own for sidewalks, street widening, or utilities, without paying him for it.\n\nIt wasn’t a case of eminent domain: There was no compensation, no formal taking. Just a response to a standard permit application.\n\n“They said in no uncertain terms, if you don't give up this land, you don't get your permit,” Trausch tells Realtor.com®.\n\nWhen Trausch refused, his addition stalled, costing him thousands of dollars in added expenses. But the deeper he dug, it became clear that he was far from alone. With legal help from the Institute for Justice, Trausch uncovered a practice that may affect more than 1,000 homeowners across Miami—one that, according to a new lawsuit, pressures residents to grant public right of way to their land through permits without any public use plan or payment.\n\nBehind the city’s request was a claim that it needed the 500-square-foot patch for a future right-of-way expansion.\n\nThe public right of way is the legal right for the public to use a specific strip of land, even if it’s privately owned. It’s the doctrine that makes sidewalks and utilities possible. In Miami, public right of way is established at 25 feet, according to local code. That means, when measured from the center of the street, there should be a 25-foot radius that is reserved for public use, Suranjan Sen, an attorney with the IJ, explains.\n\nCurrently, in the Trausches' neighborhood, that 25-foot radius lines up almost perfectly with where the sidewalk ends and their front yard begins, says Sen. But the building setback line (also called the base building line)—the area of a property where construction is prohibited—extends to 35 feet from the center of the street, creating a 10-foot gap between the edge of the public right-of-way and where building is allowed to begin.\n\nThe city said it needed the land to match future development plans, but Trausch’s team says that doesn’t mean the property should be up for grabs.\n\n“Chad owns it. He can exclude people from it. He can have his fence there, but he's just not allowed to build right up there,” says Sen.\n\nTo complicate matters further, the city had no formal plan for expansion, and didn’t offer the Trausches compensation. Worse, Trausch says, the city wanted him to pay to record the deed transfer himself.\n\n“They're asking us to pay that out of pocket, then hand [it to] them for free. … They said that's just how it's always been done,” he says.\n\nBut Trausch, a Navy veteran, wasn’t having it. Instead, he represented himself in court and fought the city for over a year at enormous personal expense. In that time, inflation and rising construction costs drove up his renovation budget by an estimated $200,000.\n\nEven more damaging, the standoff forced Trausch's wife and newborn to temporarily move out of state for child care support. Trausch stayed behind to manage the house, his job, and the lawsuit.\n\n“It's really hurt our family,” he says.\n\nUnlike a formal eminent domain proceeding, where the government must prove public use and pay compensation, the city of Miami has allegedly developed an “unwritten rule” that sidesteps that process entirely.\n\nIf a homeowner applies for a permit and their building setback or base line extends beyond the public right of way line, the city requests the difference.\n\nSen says in a deposition for the IJ’s suit that the director of Miami Public Works testified that “their policy is an unwritten rule that if you need a land use permit, and if the base building line on your property is beyond the currently established public right of way, then they'll just mechanically demand it as a condition of your permit.”\n\nThat process violates long-established legal doctrine, according to the team at the IJ.\n\n“Cities should be going through eminent domain for these kinds of things,” Sen says. But, he adds, “I'm not sure that they'd even be able to take this land through eminent domain, and the reason is, they don't have any particular plan for it.”\n\nIn a proper taking, the government must justify its need, show how the land will be used, that it's reasonably necessary for the public use, and then pay fair market value for what it takes.\n\nBut no plan has been presented.\n\n“There's no plan for that land at all,” Trausch says.\n\nThe Trausches' case may be far from unique.\n\n“We've heard from architects, contractors, lawyers in Miami that they do this all the time to people in Miami, and it's just it's run as a matter of routine, and so people don't really fight back,” Trausch says.\n\nOne clue to the practice may lie in the city’s own maps.\n\n“If you look at Miami's GIS maps of property lines, you can actually see where it will zigzag,\" says Sen. \"I think one can infer that every time it zigzags like that, that represents that parcel has been forced to give up their front yard.\"\n\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs cite sworn testimony from Miami’s public works director, who stated that the city has subjected hundreds of homeowners to this requirement.\n\nYet so far, there’s been no official move to end the practice.\n\nThe legal team representing the Trausches argue that what’s happening in Miami amounts to an unconstitutional end-run around the rules of eminent domain.\n\n“We also said, if you want to eminent domain this, you can do that, but you have to compensate us,\" Trausch says.\n\nBut, he adds, \"They said, no, this isn't eminent domain. We're not compensating you anything. In fact, you have to self-finance this handover of land to us.”\n\nMost homeowners, Trausch says, don’t fight back because the value of the project they’re trying to complete often outweighs the value of the land the city wants for public right of way.\n\n“The value of me doing my project and building a home for my family will be way more, in most cases, than the land,\" he says. \"So they count on most people just giving up.”\n\nWhen the Institute for Justice entered the case, the city quickly backed off its demand—at least for the Trausches. “As soon as IJ filed their notice of appearance in court, two weeks later, the city said, OK, we're gonna waive that condition.”\n\nTo Trausch, the timing sent a message. “It's kind of insulting, right? Because it means they were just happy to fight me and stonewall me. But as soon as some real lawyers showed up, they tried to make it go away.”\n\nEven then, Trausch says the city made clear that the waiver was temporary. “They said they reserve the right to ask for this land and demand it again.”\n\nThat means that any new permit—for a new roof, future addition, or other necessary upgrade for a historic house built in the 1930s—could trigger a taking. That’s why he and the IJ are pressing forward with their case. They want the court to declare the practice illegal and block the city from using it in the future. They’re also seeking damages for the costs of the delay, now estimated at several hundred thousand dollars.\n\nBeyond the legal questions, Trausch says the case raises a deeper issue about fairness and trust. “We like living in Miami, we believe in the community, we want to put down roots here, and, we expect them to follow the same rules they expect us to follow.”\n\nThat's why it's about more than just a 500-square-foot strip of land, his attorneys argue.\n\n“People don’t realize how important land use law is to our daily lives,\" Sen says. At the heart of the case, he argues, is a basic constitutional promise. “People have a right to use their property, and people have a right not to have their property taken from them without just compensation.”",

    "description": "Some in the Trump administration are reportedly concerned with the speed at which officials claimed \"domestic terrorism\" in the aftermath of Renee Good's death.",
    "fullText": "Some in the Trump administration are reportedly concerned with the speed at which officials claimed “domestic terrorism” in the aftermath of the ICE-involved shooting death of Minnesota mom Renee Good.\n\nGood was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who captured the incident on his own phone as he let off three rounds after Good refused to exit her van.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem immediately accused Good of “domestic terrorism” for trying to “ram them with her vehicle.”\n\nVice President J.D. Vance and President Donald Trump all repeated Noem’s talking points, with Vance accusing the media of lying about the incident.\n\nPolitico reported Friday that “even supporters of the president” are afraid the aggressive approach “risks undermining public confidence in the ongoing investigation.”\n\nOne person close to the administration told Politico, “Do I think it’s domestic terrorism? Yeah, I do. But it might not have been wise to say that at the outset, how [Noem] said it.”\n\nAnother administration official concerned about the incident widening the political divide told Politico, “I don’t know how we recover from this.”\n\nThey continued, “This is highly problematic and not a good look and not something our government should be remotely engaged in.”\n\nVideos of the shooting incident have been circulating on social media, and some pundits have called them a “Rorschach test” for conservatives and liberals.\n\nOn Friday, Vance posted a new video angle that he claimed vindicated the officer for firing in self-defense, but liberals noted Good’s demeanor and words to the agent — “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you” — before she appears to turn the steering wheel away from the agent in an apparent attempt to leave the scene.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin commented on the video Vance posted, telling Politico, “If you weaponize a vehicle, a deadly weapon to kill or cause bodily harm to a federal law enforcement officer, that is an act of domestic terrorism and will be prosecuted as such.”\n\nPresident Trump said Friday that he supported the FBI’s unusual move to block state officials from investigating the incident because Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) is “a stupid person.”\n\nThe post ‘I Don’t Know How We Recover From This’: Trump Officials Reportedly Worried About Quick Claims of ‘Domestic Terrorism’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The family of a woman who was incorrectly declared dead is getting a $3.25 million settlement\n\nTimesha Beauchamp, who had cerebral palsy, died in October 2020, two months after she was inaccurately pronounced dead\n\nThe 20-year-old woman's family was engaged in a years-long legal battle after her death\n\nThe family of a woman who was incorrectly declared dead is getting a multi-million dollar payout.\n\nTimesha Beauchamp, who had cerebral palsy, was declared dead via phone by an emergency room doctor at her Southfield, Mich., home in August 2020. She was 20.\n\nWhen Beauchamp later arrived at a funeral home, a worker, who was prepared to embalm the woman's body, found she was still breathing with her eyes open.\n\nBeauchamp was transferred to a hospital, but she died two months later in October due to what her family's attorney, Geoffrey Fieger of Fieger Law, said was \"massive brain damage\" sustained from being denied oxygen for too long when she was wrongly said to be deceased.\n\nNow, Beauchamp’s family is getting a $3.25 million settlement, Fieger Law confirmed. \"After years of hard-fought litigation, we were able to achieve justice for Timesha and her family,\" the law firm said in a statement to PEOPLE.\n\n\"Like many of the families and people that we represent, this is a bittersweet moment for the family. They are able to close this chapter in their lives, but nothing will ever bring Timesha back,\" Fieger Law continued.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOfficials in Southfield, Mich., reacted to the settlement in a statement obtained by PEOPLE.\n\n\"We recognize that no resolution can undo the profound tragedy that occurred on August 23, 2020, or ease the pain experienced by Ms. Beauchamp’s family,\" they said. “This case involved extraordinarily difficult circumstances that arose in the complex world of a global pandemic.\"\n\n\"The City respects the judicial process and believes that the complexity of these issues and the emotional impact on all parties made resolution through settlement appropriate at this time. The City remains committed to providing the highest quality of emergency medical services to our community and hopes this settlement allows all parties to move forward,\" officials continued.\n\nBack in 2020, a spokesperson for the Oakland County Medical Examiner’s Office told PEOPLE that Beauchamp's death declaration was based on real-time medical data, including heartbeat and breathing, that was provided by responding authorities and EMS personnel.\n\nIn a previous statement to PEOPLE, a spokesperson for the Southfield Fire Department said responding authorities \"followed all appropriate city, county and state protocols and procedures in this case.\"\n\nBeauchamp's family eventually sued the Southfield EMS Paramedics for $50 million for declaring her dead when she was \"very much alive,\" attorney Fieger said in a previous statement.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nLast year, on the five-year anniversasry of Beauchamp's death, her mother, Erica Lattimore, said she had no plans to stop pursuing justice for her child.\n\n\"I'm not giving up,\" Lattimore said, per WDIV-TV. \"I will go through the long haul, however long it takes. She lived 20 years. If it takes 20 more years for this to get heard in court and God gives me the breath, I'm there.\"",

    "description": "Here's everything Matt LaFleur had to say following the Packers' stunning loss to the Bears in the NFC Wild Card Round.",
    "fullText": "Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur answered questions from the media for around 12 minutes following his team's stunning collapse during Saturday's NFC Wild Card Round loss to the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field.\n\nThe Packers led 21-3 at halftime and 27-16 late in the fourth quarter and still found a way to lose.\n\nLaFleur's team lost five straight games to end the 2025 season. And he'll now head into the offseason with a contract negotiation and a big organization decision ahead.\n\nA few tidbits from LaFleur's post-game press conference:\n\n-- On the loss: \"This one is going to hurt for a really, really long time. When you're in complete control of a football game and script gets flipped in the second half...it was a lot of self-inflicted things. Give credit to them, we knew they were a team that could come back and fight, they proved it all season long. We had opportunities to put them away and didn't get it done.\"\n\n-- On what went wrong: \"A lot of bad things happened. A pivotal part was, offensively, we come out in the second half and could not get anything going...it was too many opportunities when you have the ball and not scoring.\" LaFleur said the Bears started bringing pressure in the second half and the Packers reacted poorly up front.\n\n-- On Caleb Williams: \"He's a great player. You can't give him that many opportunities...you have to find a way to put him away.\"\n\n-- On his future, does he expect to be back? \"With all due respect to your question, now is not the time for that. I'm just hurting for these guys. I can only think about what just happened. There will be time for that.\"\n\n-- On Jordan Love: \"I thought he played his ass off...we didn't do enough around him. I can't say enough great things about Jordan Love.\"\n\n-- On Brandon McManus: \"One of those kicks was a long kick at the end of the half, conditions were windy. But the difference was they made theirs and we did not.\"\n\n-- On delay of game after a timeout: \"That's a great question. That's inexcusable.\"\n\n-- Did he change how he called plays in the second half:\" No. They started bringing more pressure. So we went to more of our dropback protections...there were multiple occasions where it should have been picked up but wasn't.\"\n\n-- How to flip the script: \"We have to do a better job of keeping our composure....when you get in big games, when you don't execute simple fundamentals, it comes back to bite you. And that's exactly what happened.\"\n\n-- On what it means to be the Packers coach: \"It means everything to me. This is the greatest organization in the world, in my opinion. It's very humbling. And I'm disappointed for everybody that's associated with the Green Bay Packers. I'm disappointed for our locker room, our fans, our leadership, all our employees, everybody involved with the Packers.\"\n\n-- On the late timeouts: \"We wanted to get a good play that could pick up a chunk. We had an injury that burned some time. The timeout that really hurt us was when we make a substitution error and we have too many defensive players on the field. That stuff cannot happen.\"\n\n-- On the last play: \"I did not see what happened in the pocket. We were trying to get everybody in the end zone. He was going to spit it out to Rome to get 5-7 yards and get a little closer. When he dropped the ball, then it becomes the last play of the game. It's just chaos.\"\n\n-- On getting over the hump as an organization: \"It's going to take a lot of work because we're not where we want to be. I know we fought through a lot of adversity this year but unfortunately, we did not do enough to overcome that adversity. That's all of us, collectively. We have to do more, we have to be better. It's never an excuse. I know we lost some key players but you have to find a way to overcome that. I think we have a lot of talent on our team, it's just disappointing.:\n\nLIVE: Head Coach Matt LaFleur speaks to the media🎙️\n https://t.co/43qvL0A3Dt\n\n— Green Bay Packers (@packers) January 11, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: What Matt LaFleur had to say after Packers' stunning playoff collapse in Chicago",

    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears continue to prove that they like to hibernate, but they do not die. After having six comeback wins in the regular season, they capped off yet another one in their postseason matchup against the Green Bay Packers, winning 31-27 in a stunning comeback victory to advance to the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThings looked bleak early, as the Bears fell behind 21-3 in the first half after Jordan Love threw three touchdown passes. The Bears offense sputtered too many times and failed to convert on multiple fourth downs as faith in the defense was at an all-time low. Things looked bleak, but the team didn't lose hope.\n\nQuarterback Caleb Williams and the defense rallied in the second half to turn the momentum, scoring 28 points to storm back and retake the lead. Key passes to Colston Loveland, DJ Moore, and Rome Odunze kept drives alive as the Bears took control of the game from the Packers. After Williams found Moore for the go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, the Packers were unable to mount one more scoring drive.\n\nIt was the craziest comeback victory in a season full of them, and the NFL world took notice.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIn his first playoff game, Caleb Williams showed why he's the Chicago Bears franchise quarterback. Williams led the Bears to a 31-27 comeback win over the Green Bay Packers, helping score 25 points in the fourth quarter along the way.\n\nAt first, it seemed like Williams' night was going to end in disappointment, as the Packers had full control of the contest. However, Williams turned it around in the fourth quarter, willing the Bears offense to an explosion of points.\n\nThe playoff win is not only Williams' first, it's also the Bears first in over 15 years. Williams becomes just the third Bears quarterback since 2000 to win a playoff game, joining Jay Cutler and Rex Grossman.\n\nAfter the game, Williams immediately celebrated by wearing the cheese-grater hat that Chicago popularized after their last win against Green Bay. He even grated cheese on the Prime Video set.\n\nCaleb Williams, DJ Moore, and Colston Loveland showed up on the postgame show wearing cheese grater hats\n\nwhile Caleb even started grating cheese after winning against the Packers pic.twitter.com/zlDxeB283I\n\n— Ahmed/The Ears/IG: BigBizTheGod 🇸🇴 (@big_business_) January 11, 2026\n\nFor the season, this marked the Bears' seventh come-from-behind win, the most in NFL history. Here's a breakdown of how Williams' shined on Saturday night.\n\nMORE: Matthew Golden scores first career TD in playoffs\n\nWilliams night began on a sour note, as he threw two interceptions before his first touchdown, but he came alive in the fourth quarter. Williams led the Packers to a fourth-quarter comeback, leading Chicago's offense to 25 points in the final 15 minutes.\n\nThe majority of Williams' highlights came in the fourth quarter as part of the huge comeback. Williams' best play on the night was perhaps a 4th-and-8 conversion on a play that the Bears needed to have.\n\nThe Bears had to have this first down.\n\nAnd they got it and more!\n\nGBvsCHI on Prime Video\nAlso streaming on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/zFAk3egnmE\n\nFrom that point on, Williams scored two touchdowns, one to get within three points and another to take the lead in the final minutes of the game.

    "title": "Jaylen Brown unloads on officials after receiving 0 free throws in loss to Spurs: 'Give me the fine'",
    "description": "The Celtics star didn't hold back on the refs after a frustrating game against the Spurs.",
    "fullText": "Jaylen Brown can expect a firmly worded letter from the NBA in his inbox over the next few days. He made very clear he is OK with that on Saturday.\n\nIn a battle between two teams near the top of their conference standings, Brown's Boston Celtics lost 100-95 to the San Antonio Spurs. Boston finished the game with a season-low four free throws, while the Spurs received 20 attempts.\n\nBrown had a productive but inefficient game with 27 points on 11-of-28 shooting (and zero free-throw attempts), plus 8 rebounds, 7 assists and 5 turnovers. After the game, he blasted the officiating crew of Curtis Blair, Nick Buchert and Jason Goldenberg while speaking to reporters:\n\n“I'll accept the fine at this point. I thought it was some bulls*** tonight. I think they're a good defensive team, but they ain't that damn good. I hope somebody can just pull up the clips, because it's the same s*** every time we play a good team. It's, like, they refuse to make a call, then they call touch fouls on the other end, and that's just extremely frustrating, bro.\n\n\"We play hard. We are outplaying our expectations, we compete hard on the defensive end and they reward the other team with touch fouls and we go down there and guys are allowed to get away with — somebody please pull it up. Every time we play a good team the inconsistency is crazy. I'll take the f***ing fine. Curtis, all them dudes, was terrible tonight. I don't care, they can fine me whatever they want.\"\n\nWhile we can't break down every call and non-call Brown has in mind, the data indicates he might have a point. As a team, the Celtics had received 4.4 fewer free-throw attempts than their opponent per game entering Saturday, the lowest mark in the NBA, while the Spurs are the second-highest at 4.7 more than their opponent per game (the Los Angeles Lakers are first at 4.8 more).\n\nWhat's more, if we are to take \"a good team\" to mean a team that has won at least 60% of its games this season, that free-throw margin becomes an incredible 10.7 fewer per game when including the Spurs game. In a Nov. 1 loss to the Houston Rockets, Houston received 28 more free-throw attempts than Boston.\n\nThis all comes with a disclaimer: equal free-throw attempts does not mean good officiating. Different styles of play on offense and defense lead to different foul rates. An offense that focuses on driving the ball is going to receive more free throws than one that attempts more 3-pointers. The Celtics could fall in the latter category, as they have the second-most 3-point attempts per game in the league.\n\nStill, the team at the bottom of pile in what is essentially a ref decision is never going to be happy, and Brown insisted that the allowed physicality was hurting his team:\n\n\"I'm irate at how they officiated the game today. If we can't get to the free throw line, and teams are allowed to be physical and bump us off our spots, it's hard to win games like that. We shot four free throws tonight and lost the game by four.\n\n\"Not to say that's the whole game, the whole story. We've got to be better in spots, I've got to be better in spots, but goddamn. I'm driving to the basket, I'm physical, I don't flop, I don't shy away from contact. I go up strong, I'm athletic, and nothing. I had zero free throws tonight. The inconsistency is f***ing crazy. Give me the fine.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time this season he's complained about the officiating.\n\nThe loss knocks the Celtics' record down to 24-14, placing them in a tie with the New York Knicks for the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. However they are officiated, they've still been one of the NBA's biggest surprises in a Jayson Tatum-less season.\n\nIn Tatum's absence, Brown is averaging a career-high 29.5 points per game and will almost certainly be suiting up at the NBA All-Star Game next month if healthy.",

    "fullText": "I’m pretty much non-verbal after watching the Green Bay Packers choke away a second straight game to the Chicago Bears (and they tried to do it three times). Here’s a quick rundown of the team’s snap counts. If I have something to say about it, it’s noted. No full breakdowns this week.\n\nThe offensive line was Rasheed Walker, Aaron Banks, Sean Rhyan, Anthony Belton and Jordan Morgan from left to right. Backup center Jacob Monk was injured on field goal protection, and starter Rhyan was injured in the fourth quarter, costing the Packers a 10-second runoff. Lecitus Smith played center for the last three plays of offense. Darian Kinnard’s two snaps came at tight end, one of which he caught his first pass of the season and fumbled.\n\nNick Niemann did not officially get a snap, but was the player in coverage who was scored on for the two-point conversion in the fourth quarter. The Bears played heavy personnel on that play, with extra offensive linemen and tight ends on the play. The Packers matched it with their goal-line defense, with extra linebackers, which put Niemann on the field following Edgerin Cooper’s injury. In normal defensive situations, Cooper was replaced by Isaiah McDuffie, the team’s usual third linebacker in 4-3 looks, who was backfilled by Ty’Ron Hopper.\n\nThe Packers finally used Keisean Nixon as their returner in this game, showing the world that their preferred returners, when the game is on the line, are Nixon and running back Josh Jacobs. This team is not trying in the return game in the regular season.\n\nAlso, Trevon Diggs only played one snap the entire game, defense or special teams.\n\nEvan Williams missed one snap and was replaced by Kitan Oladapo on the play.",

    "fullText": "Bowling Green, Ky. – The UTEP women’s basketball team fell 68–59 at Western Kentucky on Saturday afternoon at E. A. Diddle Arena. The Miners move to 9–6 overall and 1–3 in Conference USA play.\n\nUTEP battled throughout the night, showing resilience and keeping the game close at times, but Western Kentucky’s scoring runs proved decisive. Ivane Tensaie led the Miners with 16 points, while Ndack Mbengue added 9 points and a team-high 11 rebounds. Portia Adams contributed 7 points and 3 assists, and Delma Zita added 7 points and 2 steals.\n\n“I thought we played harder in today’s game,” head coach Keitha Adams said. “Lack of scoring in the first quarter is hurting us. We played them tougher in the second, third, and fourth quarters, but we have to find 40 minutes and get off to better starts.”\n\nWestern Kentucky set the tone early with a 13–1 run in the first six minutes, though UTEP responded late in the quarter. Tensaie and Tatiana Collazo each hit a 3-pointer, and Zita added a tip-in to narrow the gap. The Miners trailed 19–12 heading into the second quarter.\n\nUTEP came out aggressive in the second, forcing turnovers and generating transition opportunities. Brooklyn Terry and Adams fueled the offense, keeping the Miners within striking distance. Western Kentucky countered with timely 3-pointers and strong finishes inside, taking a 32–24 lead into halftime.\n\nThe Miners opened the third quarter with energy, as Samayoa-Mathis and Tensaie scored consecutive baskets to pull within one. Tensaie’s 3-pointer tied the game at 41 midway through the period. Despite the Miners’ push, Western Kentucky closed the quarter on a 9–0 run to take a 50–41 advantage into the fourth.\n\nUTEP fought to cut into the lead in the final quarter, with Tensaie and Adams hitting key buckets and Zita adding a layup to pull within single digits at 62–53. Western Kentucky maintained control, using fast-break points and timely 3-pointers to secure the 68–59 victory.\n\nThe Orange and Blue finished the game shooting 34.5 percent from the field, 32.0 percent from three, and 73.3 percent at the line, while adding 39 rebounds and forcing 12 turnovers.\n\nWKU was led by Salma Khedr with 18 points, while Trinity Rowe added 13 points. Caleigh-Rose West finished with 11 points and six rebounds.\n\nUTEP returns home for a two-game Conference USA homestand against Missouri State (Jan. 15) and FIU (Jan. 17).",

Martin. \"Players and coaches alike. So this one meant something to us.”\n\nIt isn't clear exactly what Johnson is referencing as far as the noise at the start of the week is concerned, but we do know the two teams shared a confrontation at midfield prior to kickoff, although no fights occurred.\n\nThe Bears' win over the Packers was nothing short of incredible.\n\nChicago looked dead in the first half and trailed 21-3, which was the largest halftime deficit for a home playoff game in Bears franchise history.\n\nThe Bears also trailed 21-6 in the fourth quarter, making this the largest fourth-quarter deficit the Bears have overcome in a playoff game since 1933, when Chicago trailed the New York Giants by five points before winning the game.\n\nWe really shouldn't be all that surprised the Bears managed to claw their way back and win, as the team has been doing it all season long.\n\nNow, the Bears will wait to see who their opponent for the divisional round will be as the rest of Wild Card Weekend plays out.\n\nWhy LaFleur, Johnson shared unfriendly handshake after Packers-Bears\n\nT.J.

Notching seven 3-pointers, the first ten minutes ended with NM State trailing 28-9.\n\nAnna Csenyi knocked down the lone Aggie triple of the first half in the second quarter, posting five points in the opening 20 minutes of play. Outscored 21-10 in the stanza, NM State headed to halftime trailing by a score of 49-19.\n\nImani Warren tallied her first points of the contest to open the Aggie scoring in the second half, her seventh 3-pointer of the season. Morane Dossou collected a steal and finished at the rim on the next possession, giving the Aggies their best scoring stretch to that point in the contest. Emma Christiano and DeAvion Wilson each collected their first points in the frame, though the Aggies trailed 71-32 heading into the fourth.\n\nLucía Yenes and Senoj Jones paced the Aggies in fourth-quarter scoring, with the forwards each posting 11 points on Saturday afternoon. A trio of 3-pointers in the final frame helped NM State outscore the Blue Raiders 19-17, but ultimately the Crimson & White fell by a final score of 88-51.\n\nLucía Yenes finished with 11 points, her 12th game in double figures this season. The Madrid, Spain, native added nine rebounds, a trio of steals and one block.\n\nFreshman Senoj Jones posted a new personal best with 11 points, chipping in five boards, one block and one steal in just 16 minutes.\n\nAnna Csenyi finished with seven points, notching a triple in the second quarter against MTSU, continuing her run of at least one triple in six straight games, and nine of the past 10 contests.\n\nPosting five made 3-pointers on the afternoon, the Aggies tallied four or more makes from long range for the fifth time in the last seven games and the seventh time overall since Dec. 1.\n\nGoing 10-for-13 from the free-throw line as a team, this marked the second straight contest above 75% from the charity stripe.\n\nNM State tied a season-best with six blocks, with Imani Warren leading the way with two.\n\nThe Aggies recorded a season low in assists, dishing out just four helpers on 18 made field goals.\n\nFor the first time since Dec. 16, NM State failed to tally at least 10 steals (9). \n\nQUOTABLES\n\nEmma Christiano, on the team’s performance in Murfreesboro:“We pride ourselves on team defense to keep us in close games. Against experienced and disciplined teams like MTSU, it’s crucial that we find a rhythm on offense. We simply have to make shots if we want to compete at a high level. This game was a huge opportunity to learn and grow. I’m proud of the effort behind today’s game and that’s why this team is special, that is what we will always fall back on. I have full faith in my teammates and the coaching staff, this is just another step in our journey.”\n\nSenoj Jones, on the result in Tennessee: “Today’s game was definitely a test for us. There were plenty of lessons to be learned from and to better ourselves for the next game. This team isn’t a quit team, and I’m proud of us for staying in the fight. I’m thankful for amazing teammates who picked my head up on missed shots and opportunities.”        \n\nHead Coach Jody Adams, on Saturday’s contest: “I was impressed by their freshman, a very talented group that have the ability to play at the power four level. MTSU continues to propel itself forward with buy-in and commitment to this new era of NIL.”\n\nNM State returns next week for a pair of home contests, playing host to FIU on Thursday, Jan. 15, and conference newcomer Missouri State on Saturday, Jan. 17. Thursday’s meeting is scheduled to tip off at 6 p.m. MT from the Pan American Center, streaming live on ESPN+ with live stats available at nmstatesports.com/stats.",

    "description": "What a night in Chicago: the Bears won their first playoff game in 15 years and the Cubs made their biggest free-agent splash in a decade.",
    "fullText": "Simply, it was the greatest sports evening in Chicago since 2016.\n\nWhile the Chicago Bears were making arguably the greatest comeback in franchise history against the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night in the playoffs, the Chicago Cubs were making their biggest free-agent splash in a decade with a five-year, $175 million agreement with infielder Alex Bregman.\n\n“Big night for Chicago,’’ Scott Boras, Bregman’s agent, said in a text to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nSo, while the Bears were coming back from a 21-3 halftime deficit to win 31-27, Boras and the Cubs were actually in the middle of negotiations?\n\n“Bears game?’’ Boras texted USA TODAY Sports. “I was packing the green in for Breggy with the Cubs.’’\n\nThe Cubs, who tried to sign Bregman a year ago to a four-year, $115 million deal, got their man and stole him away from the Boston Red Sox with the richest salary in Cubs’ history.\n\nAnd after listening to critics all winter, saying that they haven’t made enough moves or spent enough money to make themselves World Series contenders − or at least better than the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central − they shelled out the big cash after acquiring Miami Marlins starter Edward Cabrera just three days ago.\n\nJust like that, the Cubs have got folks in Chicago believing it could be 2016 all over again, the year they won their first World Series since 1908.\n\nCertainly, Bregman, 31, is a huge winner. He opted out of the $80 million owed to him the next two years by the Boston Red Sox, and spun it into a franchise-record $35-million-a-year deal with a full no-trade clause and no opt-outs. The only Cubs’ contracts bigger in total value is Jason Heyward’s eight-year, $184 million contract and shortstop Dansby Swanson’s seven-year, $177 million contract.\n\nBregman, who turns 32 in March, will now earn $215 million over six years.\n\nJust like that, the Cubs could be a giant in the NL. They now have a wealth of depth in their infield in which they could either slide Matt Shaw to second base and trade Nico Hoerner or make Shaw a super utility player and keep Hoerner for one more year before he hits free agency.\n\nNo matter, the Cubs feel as if they’re set, and love Bregman’s leadership skills, as he has been in the playoffs every full year of his 10-year career.\n\nThis is why the Red Sox badly wanted to bring him back and were runner-up in the negotiations. The Arizona Diamondbacks also had interest in Bregman, but once they decided to retain All-Star second baseman Ketel Marte, they dropped out of the Bregman sweepstakes, leaving the Cubs and Red Sox as the two finalists.\n\nBregman, who hit .273 with an .821 OPS with 18 homers and 28 doubles last season, is the biggest free agent to sign this winter. Considering he’s two years older than Cody Bellinger, it perhaps illustrates why Bellinger has not accepted the Yankees’ five-year offer in excess of $150 million.\n\nBregman’s signing now leaves the Red Sox badly needing Bo Bichette, who also is being courted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays. Bichette has a zoom call meeting Monday with the Phillies.\n\nThe Cubs couldn’t care less what happens next. They believe they’re set now. They’re convinced they can win their first NL Central title in a full season since 2017.\n\nAnd, hey, with the Cubs’ convention scheduled this upcoming weekend, they not only plan to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of their World Series, but believe it could be a prelude to an October to remember in 2026.\n\nWhat a night in Chicago, with the Bears winning at Solider Fielder and the Cubs celebrating in their offices at Wrigley Field.\n\nWho would have imagined a brutally cold, blustery evening in Chicago could feel so beautiful?\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Alex Bregman signing with Cubs and Bears win make great Chicago night",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nUrban Meyer is fully sold on the Indiana Hoosiers, as they attempt to complete one of the greatest turnaround stories in college football history, let alone sports history period.\n\nThe Hoosiers put their stamp on a national title berth with a 56-22 Peach Bowl win Friday night, but former Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer sees a gradual step the Hoosiers can take if they were to beat the Hurricanes: an undeniable seat at the table of elite college football teams.\n\nMore: Transfer portal QB tracker 2026: Latest news on DJ Lagway, Dylan Raiola and others on the move\n\n“I’ve been saying it for two years, as well-coached as I’ve seen in my lifetime,” Meyer said on \"The Triple Option Podcast\". “Again, I’ve said this several times. I think it’s really important to re-emphasize. When you watch a team, and I always come in on Sunday and get ready to watch a team or get ready to play, some things stand out. I don’t watch, necessarily, the — hey, that’s a great touchdown pass. I wanna see how well coached they are, how tough they are.\"\n\nMeyer said throwing the metrics out is key when looking at Indiana, because skill for skill is the right approach.\n\nMore: Indiana vs. Miami National Championship tickets: How to buy, prices, seats and start time for 2026 CFP game\n\n\"They run the ball, but also the perimeter blocking out there. You never see what happened, like the pick six, where a guy misses a block or something happens. So, perimeter blocking. How about the running back steps up and hits a linebacker or safety coming from a 10-yard running start and the running back hits him right in the jaw,” Meyer said. “And Mendoza completes a pass. The route efficiency. There’s no wasted movement when the receivers run their routes. Those aren’t all five-star receivers; those aren’t first-rounders. Those are guys that are really, really good players that play great.\"\n\nThey will have a chance to showcase themselves once more against a Hurricanes team on a mission to continue shocking college football as they upset Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl before ending Ole Miss' season in the Fiesta Bowl to get to the title game themselves. They knocked off Texas A&M in the opening round in College Station.\n\nThe game is set for Monday, Jan. 19, in Miami Gardens, Fla., providing a fitting conclusion to an otherwise chaotic season.",

    "description": "Sunderland got back to winning ways with a 0-3 penalty shootout success, as Malc Dugdale reports",
    "fullText": "When the team was announced, I was surprised at its strength and the lack of rotation after the tired showing against Brentford, but once again, Régis Le Bris got it bang on and but for a dubious penalty, we would’ve won comfortably and the rested lads would’ve enjoyed even more of a recharge of their batteries.\n\nAs it was, we had to go to extra time and then a shootout to secure our place in today’s draw, but you have to admire the commitment of the gaffer.\n\nI would’ve been more than happy to put out a weaker side and indeed to go out if we had to, so we can truly focus on the Premier League, but Le Bris wants more and it’s standards like that which make him an even better coach than any of us expected when he was appointed.\n\nThe decisions he made could well have backfired but he committed to the decision and was once again proved right.\n\nPutting Luke O’Nien at centre back after so little football this season, for example, was a brave call.\n\nHe was up against a big strong striker in Beto and with himself and Nordi Mukiele playing as our central defensive duo for the first time, it could well have been something the opponents could exploit, but O’Nien did really well and I was really chuffed for the club skipper.\n\nWe couldn’t do as much with Mukiele’s long throws until Dan Ballard came onto the park, but the pair did really well and although it remains to be seen if he can play consistently at Premier League level, based on that showing, he did enough for me to continue to be a utility man on the pitch or on the bench, even with our international lads back.\n\nIn other areas of the pitch, the wisdom and bravery of Le Bris led to varied levels of success.\n\nRomaine Mundle got his first start for some time and while his go-forward effort was good, his end product was often either a loss of the ball or a shot which was easily blocked.\n\nFair play to the lad; as he stung the gloves of Jordan Pickford a couple of times and if you don’t shoot, you don’t score. This is maybe more indicative of Mundle needing more of a chance to get match fit and the accuracy will come, but whether he gets that chance remains to be seen, given most of the AFCON travellers will be back in the fold very soon — and many are already.\n\nIt could well be that the return of Bertrand Traoré and company could impact Simon Adingra more than Mundle, as for me he contributed less than Mundle by some distance — despite his recent goal and the chances he’s been given ahead of others after not being selected for his national side at AFCON.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if the matchday squad we use for Crystal Palace sees Adingra pushed down to the bench, and in some ways, the decision by his national side not to pick him may have been justified if they had more productive options to consider.\n\nUp front, Eliezer Mayenda took his chance pretty well too, although it was a shame that between himself, Brian Brobbey and Wilson Isidor, we didn’t manage to get a second goal to prevent the game going to penalties…but then we wouldn’t have had another showcase of just how good Robin Roefs is!\n\nWhen the penalty was awarded in normal time, he went the right way but was fairly beaten by a decent spot kick, although I’m not sure if the penalty would’ve been awarded if VAR was in operation.\n\nThe show he put on in the shootout though was the stuff of dreams, and will be a great base for him for any future shootouts we may need to progress in this competition.\n\nI discussed this with my father-in-law shortly after the game and even as a football fan in his mid eighties, he couldn’t recall a shootout when a goalkeeper has saved all three of the opponent’s penalties — with a 3-0 success the result.\n\nFor me, Roefs could be the best in the world at what he does. He has such talent at such a young age, and I say that without hesitation.\n\nWhat a goalkeeping performance, especially as he hardly had a save to make for 120 minutes before that, and if he becomes our record sale in the coming couple of years, I wouldn’t be surprised at all.\n\nMy final words are reserved for our little general: Enzo Le Fée.\n\nDespite his penalty going terribly wrong against Brentford — a real turning point in the game with the momentum going our way — he stepped up and took his spot kick with absolute accuracy and clinical skill, so well done for banishing the demons, Enzo.\n\nWe now move on to Crystal Palace — themselves out of the cup thanks to Macclesfield Town. That shows us all how these games can go, and I take back what I wrote before the third round started.\n\nLet’s give this competition a good run. You never know: we’ve quite enjoyed a trip to Wembley of late!",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBen Johnson has become one of the best in the business at postgame speeches to his team, so we couldn't wait to see what he had in store after the Chicago Bears' incredible comeback win over the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night.\n\nA playoff win in and of itself is enough for a great postgame locker room speech, but there was a little extra juice following the contest on Saturday night, as the Bears pulled off a miraculous comeback to advance to the divisional round.\n\nNot only did the Bears trail 21-3 at halftime after a dominant showing by Green Bay over the first two quarters, but they were also losing 21-6 going into the fourth quarter before scoring 25 points in the final frame to pull out a 31-27 victory.\n\nNow, what you came for: Johnson's locker room speech.\n\nVictory vibes are real high in the @ChicagoBears locker room 🔥 pic.twitter.com/lou2wAB4qY\n\n— NFL on Prime Video (@NFLonPrime) January 11, 2026\n\nOur only disappointment is Johnson didn't rip his shirt off and flex like he did after the Week 13 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, but the speech was still electric.\n\nJohnson has done an incredible job in his first season with the Bears and should be among the leading candidates for Coach of the Year.\n\nNot only did Chicago go 11-6 to win the NFC North and secure the No. 2 seed, but the Bears also saw a much-improved season from quarterback Caleb Williams, which was the most important box to check going into the season.\n\nWith the Bears already having far exceeded expectations this season, the playoff win is just the icing on the cake.\n\nChicago will be playing with house money from here on out, although you know fans don't see it that way.\n\nInstead, Bears fans want more, and we don't blame them for it.\n\nBen Johnson explains how Packers gave Bears extra motivation\n\nWhy LaFleur, Johnson shared unfriendly handshake after Packers-Bears\n\nT.J.

    "fullText": "BYU’s 12th consecutive win may have been its sweetest to date.\n\nThe Cougars defeated rival Utah 89-84 Saturday night in Salt Lake City, earning their first victory at the Huntsman Center since 2021.\n\nKevin Young’s squad is now 15-1 on the season and 3-0 in Big 12 play.\n\nthat’s a dub up north pic.twitter.com/y33fw7hnZL\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 11, 2026\n\nThe Cougars made life difficult for themselves. Seemingly every BYU-Utah matchup at the Huntsman Center ends up being rather chaotic, but the Cougars were definitely to blame for some of the drama Saturday.\n\nBYU allowed the Runnin’ Utes to open the night on a 7-0 run, then let a 12-point second half lead to dwindle down to just a single point in less than seven minutes.\n\nThe Cougars shot just 6 of 26 from 3-point range, missed 10 free throws — including six in the second half — and gave up the most points of the season to an opponent not named UConn.\n\nWhile free throws were a struggle throughout the night, Richie Saunders knocked down two crucial ones in the final seconds to ice the victory.\n\nIt may have been ugly for BYU at times, but a win is a win, especially against a heated rival and in a venue that has too often been a haunted house for the Cougars in their history.\n\nThe “Brig 3″ was exceptional once again. Of BYU’s 89 points against Utah, 67 came from the superstar trio of Saunders, AJ Dybantsa and Rob Wright III.\n\nThe Salt Lake County native Saunders scored a team-high 24 points on 9 of 16 shooting, notching a double-double by grabbing 14 rebounds — eight coming on the offensive glass.\n\nRICHIE SAUNDERS vs Utah\n\n24 PTS | 14 REB | 3 AST | 1 STL pic.twitter.com/95Q5XTDAYQ\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 11, 2026\n\nDybantsa posted yet another 20-point outing — his ninth in a row — with six rebounds and four assists in what will be his last time playing in Salt Lake City until he suits up for or against the Utah Jazz a year from now.\n\nBYU'S AJ DYBANTSA WITH HIS 9TH-STRAIGHT GAME OF 20+ PTS 🔥 \n\nThe most in a row for a Big 12 freshman since Trae Young at Oklahoma 🤯 pic.twitter.com/lITOzAD6Jt\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 11, 2026\n\nWright added 23 points with six assists, scoring 15 points in the first half to keep the Cougars’ offense afloat early and scoring another six points in the final minutes of crunch time when some of his teammates had gone cold.\n\nROBERT WRIGHT III vs Utah\n\n23 PTS | 6 AST pic.twitter.com/xxJhzefln8\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 11, 2026\n\nAdditionally, Keba Keita scored 11 points with seven boards against his former team, adding a thunderous spiked block for good measure, and fifth starter Kennard Davis Jr. ended with eight points and two made 3-pointers.\n\nThat's a BAAAAAD man \n\n📺ESPN pic.twitter.com/xhWy9rDXIn\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 11, 2026\n\nBYU made history on the Hill. Prior to Saturday, not only had the Cougars failed to win at the Huntsman Center since 2021, but they’d only managed two total wins there since Jimmer Fredette graduated.\n\nFor as frustrating as Saturday’s action may have been at times for Cougar Nation, no one should complain about a road victory against Utah. They don’t grow on trees.\n\nThe win also marks BYU’s 12th in a row and secures the first-ever 3-0 Big 12 start for the Cougars as well.\n\nBYU shot 50% from the field against Utah and dished out 16 team assists. The Cougars, who led for more than 31 minutes of play, also won the battle down low with 46 paint points and a 41-33 rebounding margin.",

    "description": "Apple Wallet taking up 4GB on your iPhone? Here’s why it happens, what causes the storage spike, and how you can fix it safely.",
    "fullText": "We use the Wallet app without thinking too much about it. It holds our cards, tickets, and passes, and it usually stays out of the way. You check Settings > General > iPhone Storage and see something that makes no sense: Wallet shows nearly 4GB in Documents and Data. You delete your passes, remove cards, even delete and reinstall the app, but the number stays the same.\n\nIf you feel stuck, you are not alone. People have reported Wallet storage that looks wildly out of proportion to what the app does.\n\nWallet does more than store a few cards. It also holds local files tied to passes and payment features. That storage can add up, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nIn short, you did the right first steps. If Wallet still shows 4GB after a reinstall, you need to force iOS to rebuild whatever Wallet keeps locally.\n\nWork through these in order. You will usually get results before the last step.\n\n1) Restart your iPhone\nA restart sounds basic, but it can flush stuck indexing and temporary caches. After you restart, re-check iPhone Storage to see if Wallet drops.\n\n2) Update iOS, then check storage again\nIf you run an older build, update first. Storage bugs often ride along in iOS releases and Apple fixes them quietly. After the update finishes, give your phone a few minutes on Wi-Fi and power, then check Wallet storage again.\n\n3) Remove Wallet content the “full” way\nEven if you already deleted passes, do a clean sweep:\n\nThen restart again and re-check storage.\n\n4) Sign out of iCloud and sign back in\nThis step often forces iOS apps that sync data to rebuild local databases.\n\nThen check Wallet storage again.\n\n5) Back up, then reset as the “break glass” fix\nIf Wallet still sits at multiple gigabytes, treat it like a system-level storage bug. You see similar behavior in other Apple apps when their Documents and Data gets stuck, and the most reliable fix becomes a full reset after backup.\n\nThis takes longer, but it gives iOS a clean slate. In many “storage won’t clear” cases, it is the only step that truly resets the hidden cache.\n\nA big Wallet number does not automatically mean someone hacked you. People who never use Wallet still see some Wallet storage, and Apple Support forum threads show that small amounts can appear even when you do nothing with the app.\n\nThe issue here is scale. Gigabytes usually mean a stuck cache, a database that never compacts, or a system bug that keeps re-growing the same files.",

By targeting core digital infrastructure, our investments scale across many sectors and benefit a broad range of users. Improving the security, stability, and reusability of open software components directly enhances the productivity, competitive edge, and capacity for innovation of startups and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe open source ecosystem, while incredibly successful, is also increasingly fragile. Many more people are using the software than contributing to it. It is time to invest in digital commons, volunteer communities and the open source ecosystem to build the digital world we want to see. We are working to strengthen the self-determined use of digital technologies and systems by individuals, industry, and governments.\n\nTo prepare an application, we ask that you review and consider all information regarding the selection criteria and the subsequent process. Applications are accepted exclusively through our application platform.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide prior advice on whether a project generally falls under our objectives. If you would like to apply for support for a project, please first check thoroughly whether all the criteria listed below apply.\n\nSubmission through our application system: submissions must be completed through the online application portal. No supplemental materials should be sent via email or any other form of communication at this time.\n\nCompleteness: applications must be completed in German or English. The questions must be answered to a degree that allows us to assess and evaluate the applications.\n\nProposed activities: the activities listed in the application must be related to developing or maintaining open digital base technologies. Development is our primary focus, although security audits, conference attendance, and other community-based events can be included in the application should they be necessary.\n\nEstimated costs: The cost of the work described in the application must exceed €50,000 (current minimum).\n\nPublic financing: Projects are not eligible to receive financing or work commissions from the Sovereign Tech Fund if other public entities are already making or have made grants or investments for the same proposed activities.\n\nFOSS: all code and documentation to be supported must be licensed such that it may be freely reusable, changeable, and redistributable. OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre licenses are acceptable for code. Creative-Commons-like licenses for documentation may not include non-commercial or “no derivative” clauses.\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund invests in open digital base technologies that are vital to the development of other software or enable digital networking. We invest in projects that benefit and strengthen the open source ecosystem. Examples include libraries for programming languages, package managers, open implementations of communication protocols, administration tools for developers, digital encryption technologies, and more. We do not finance the development of prototypes. Our currently funded projects show the range and type of technologies that characterize open digital base technologies.\n\nWe are currently not looking for user-facing applications, such as messaging apps or file storage services. If this changes, we will announce it here.\n\nThese are the criteria we use to review all projects that fulfill the basic requirements:\n\nA technology is prevalent when it is widely used for or within other technologies.\n\nA technology is relevant if it is significant for one or more important societal sectors, e.g., education, health care, energy sector, industry.\n\nA technology is vulnerable if important work – to keep the quality of the project or to enhance it – is not (sufficiently) funded by other actors or cannot be completed for other structural reasons.\n\nThere are benefits for society or critical sectors of society (e.g., education, health care, energy, industry) by funding the technology.\n\nWe evaluate the work that is planned in the proposed project. For example, we examine the feasibility and overall impact of the activities described in the proposal.\n\nThe applicants, their organization, or community demonstrate that they have the necessary knowledge, insight, and technological skills to do the proposed work. They are either a recognized part of the community around the technology, or they have the endorsement of that community or the maintainer.\n\nLastly, the evaluation is guided by our strategy and mission. That is, from start to finish, we look at how the project fits into the Sovereign Tech Agency’s mission and contributes to the goal of sustainably strengthening the open source ecosystem in the public interest.\n\nCreate an account to submit an application. Please note that you will only receive a submission confirmation from us if you agreed to receive emails or SMS from us when you registered. If you change this in the settings after your registration, it will only affect future messages from us, such as acceptances or rejections.\n\nDownload a preview of the application form (PDF)\n\nAfter you submit an application, your submission goes through a multistep review and selection process. First, we check if the submission meets the basic requirements listed above. Those that do, are reviewed by the Sovereign Tech Fund using the criteria. You will hear from us whether your application passes those two stages.\n\nUpon positive review, a member of the program team gets in touch with the person or persons who submitted the application to scope the proposal in more detail. During this scoping phase, we work with you to clarify open questions, refine the scope of work, and create a project description, based on the application and conversations between you and the program manager.\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Agency then consults with a pool of external experts and practitioners and includes their perspectives to arrive at the final selection.\n\nThe last step includes a legal compliance review, the creation of additional supporting documentation, and the creation of a contract.\n\nFor technical problems, contact [email protected]\n\nWhen you submit an application, we’ll confirm that we have received it. Then, you can expect to hear back from us within 10 weeks. We’ll inform you whether the proposal has passed the review, and whether we’re continuing with you to the scoping phase. For some projects, the response time will be shorter, depending on the overall amount of applications to be reviewed.\n\nThe overall time between submitting an application and a potential start date of the contract is approximately 6 months.",

    "description": "Little known today, Fitz-James O’Brien deserves serious attention for developing some of science fiction’s most familiar tropes—among them microcosmic worlds, invisible monsters, time slips, and robots.",
    "fullText": "Back in the early 1930s Gilbert Seldes—a literary critic and early champion of popular culture—was asked to contribute an introduction to a volume of stories by Fitz-James O’Brien, now often regarded as the most original American writer of supernatural fiction between Edgar Allan Poe and Ambrose Bierce. At first Seldes declined, confessing that he’d never read anything by the man. But when the publisher jogged his memory, Seldes remembered that in some anthology or another he had in fact come across “The Diamond Lens,” O’Brien’s 1858 account of an obsessive microscopist who discovers an Eden-like world in a drop of water—and falls in love with the beautiful woman who lives in it.\n\nSeldes finally did introduce The Diamond Lens and Other Stories, published in 1932 as a limited edition with subtly sinister illustrations by Ferdinand Huszti Horvath. The book featured seven of O’Brien’s tales of the weird and grotesque, most notably “The Wondersmith,” which centers on a satanic toymaker whose miniature figures can be animated to kill the young children who play with them. According to Anthony Boucher, who reprinted the story in the December 1950 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, “almost the whole body of writing on robots is here in matrix.” That matrix, however, is one of melodramatic grisliness and horror in the style of the French Théâtre du Grand-Guignol. In one blood-drenched chapter, the inventor of these devil dolls tests their ferocity by setting them loose to massacre the caged birds in a pet store.\n\nO’Brien’s even better-known “What Was It?: A Mystery” describes a life-or-death struggle against an invisible and murderous humanoid entity. So popular was the story that the O’Brien scholar Jessica Amanda Salmonson found it represented in “over thirty anthologies between 1896 and 1964.”\n\nNevertheless, the Celtic Poe, as the Irish-born O’Brien has been called, is probably as little known today as he was in Seldes’s time. Yet he deserves serious attention, if only for establishing or promulgating some of science fiction’s most familiar tropes: microcosmic worlds, invisible monsters, time slips, robots. In one of his stories a fabricator of artificial eyes creates a portable surveillance camera in the form of an egg-size eyeball that transmits images to its creator. In another, O’Brien sets down the precise engineering specs for the construction of a gyroscope-like personal flying machine.\n\nWhile even his best stories tend to be structurally ramshackle and go on just a little too long, they always display O’Brien’s remarkably protean imagination. For example, “The Dragon-Fang Possessed by the Conjurer Piou-Lu” is a comic fantasy set in an ancient China that never was, one in which a tailor can be referred to as an “inventive closer of symmetrical seams.” Utterly surreal, the novella-length “From Hand to Mouth” takes place in the Hotel de Coup d’Oeil and features disembodied hands and ears, a talking bird, a heroine whose legs have been stolen, a mirror that acts as a clone generator, and an ancient guardian who, like Dante’s Bertran de Born, carries his head under his arm. The hotel’s owner is Count Goloptious, a kind of psychic vampire who slowly drains the residents of their creative vitality. For the most part this gothic comedy resembles a mix of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.\n\nIn fact, a considerable number of O’Brien’s stories should be viewed as absurdist fantasies. In “The Wonderful Adventures of Mr. Papplewick” the middle-aged protagonist finds himself accidentally transformed into a human magnet, just misses becoming a star exhibit in P.T. Barnum’s museum of grotesques, and ends up on an expedition to the North Pole, where he encounters a talking walrus. An amusing playlet, “The Gory Gnome,” neatly sends up the vogue for sentimental, romantic melodrama. Set in the Harz Mountains, it features a star-crossed couple described as the “despairing Lover” and the “Distressed Heroine.” In the opening scene of this five-page theatrical extravaganza—an active volcano plays an important role—Anna Matilda, the Distressed Heroine, enters “hurriedly, with disheveled hair, eating a sandwich,” which she quickly finishes before announcing to the audience that she’s been living on nothing but wild berries. Another story, “The Comet and I,” depicts an anthropomorphized comet taken on a tour of New York, not excluding the saloons. It’s the kind of jeu d’esprit long associated with Donald Barthelme.\n\nThe full panoply of Fitz-James O’Brien’s macabre fiction—horror stories, satires, weird tales, contes cruels—has now been assembled by the independent scholar John P. Irish in an exceptionally handsome three-volume edition comprising An Arabian Night-mare and Others (1848–1854), The Diamond Lens and Others (1855–1858), and What Was It? and Others (1858–1864). Irish’s introductory essay, which is spread out over the three volumes, provides a useful overview of O’Brien’s life and extended commentary on his major works, but also makes claims for the writer’s importance and influence that seem overzealous. No matter. Though endnotes explaining period slang and obscure allusions would have been helpful, this is the most complete edition of O’Brien’s supernatural writing now available, superseding that compiled by Salmonson in 1988.\n\nBoth Irish and Salmonson use the original magazine appearances of the stories for their copy text instead of relying on the sometimes slightly edited versions printed in William Winter’s pioneering 1881 volume, The Poems and Stories of Fitz-James O’Brien. However, we now know that Salmonson inadvertently made two misattributions: “Seeing the World” is actually an English version of a work by Vladimir Fedorovich Odoevsky, and “A Dead Secret” was written by George Augustus Sala. This confusion arose because much of O’Brien’s copious writing for periodicals appeared anonymously, as was then the common practice.\n\nMoreover, O’Brien was one of those prolific professional writers who could turn their hand to anything. Sensitive to the era’s penchant for tear-jerking sentimentality, he could produce “Duke Humphrey’s Dinner,” an O. Henry–like tale about a starving young couple who pretend to dine on imaginary delicacies and are rescued from death at almost the last moment. Alas, the two orphaned waifs and the organ grinder’s monkey in another of his tear-jerkers aren’t so lucky: all three freeze to death—on Christmas Eve.\n\nAs a magazine poet, O’Brien could turn out Keatsian lyrics, tragic ballads, or political satire. (A handful of the poems with an eerie or fantastic cast are included in Irish’s edition.) As a journalist, he produced reams of opinion essays—it’s been estimated that half of his three hundred or so known pieces of writing are devoted to political or economic matters—but he could also dash off lighthearted casuals, some under the rubric the Man About Town. His book and theater reviews blend insight with humor, always a winning combination. Though one of Herman Melville’s earliest admirers, he nonetheless suggested that the author of Typee and Mardi would be wise to adopt the familiar but elegant prose style of Joseph Addison rather than the baroque grandeur of Sir Thomas Browne. (Happily, Melville didn’t take this advice.) In judging a revival of his own popular comedy A Gentleman from Ireland, O’Brien spared neither the production nor his youthful self:\n\nThe dialogue is sometimes smart, but never witty, while occasionally it rises into the realm of fustian. The ending of the first act is weak and nonsensical. There is no characterization in it from beginning to end, and everybody talks like everybody else.\n\nThat’s scathingly (if half facetiously) dismissive, yet this transplanted Irishman’s savage indignation could sometimes match that of his countryman Jonathan Swift, particularly in the best of the early stories, “The King of Nodland and His Dwarf.” In Nodland, to sleep as many hours as possible is the whole aim and purpose of life. Given the resulting universal torpor, the Nodlanders maintain their somnolent lifestyle by enslaving members of the pastoral Cock-Crow people from a neighboring country. Meanwhile, Nodland’s government constantly replenishes its treasury—the money largely spent on frivolous luxuries for the king—by levying increasingly arcane taxes. Lord Incubus, the prime minister, reasons that “the more necessary a thing is…the more it ought to be taxed. Superfluities can be dispensed with, but if you want to be sure of a man’s money, tax something that he cannot possibly do without.”\n\nThis policy soon leads to a graduated impost on the number of hours a citizen spends asleep. Only the first four are tax-free. Unsurprisingly, a firebrand named Ivned soon calls for revolution, though he actually just craves total power for himself. “He possessed a certain species of vulgar, brazen eloquence, that was very effective with a particular class,” O’Brien writes.\n\nHis effrontery was dauntless, and his conscience, from systematic stretching, had become so large that it was capable of embracing any set of opinions from which the most profit was to be derived. He blustered largely about an article he called “patriotism,” but which in reality meant self-interest; he was, in short, one of those bold, bad men who was sufficiently elevated above his own low class to be regarded by them as a leader, but who was too far beneath any other to be looked on in the light of any thing but an unpleasant pest.\n\nAnything but an unpleasant pest himself, the easygoing O’Brien appears to have charmed every echelon of New York society. He was, however, cagey about his past. We now know—largely from the excellent 1944 biography by Francis Wolle—that he was born in Cork, either in 1826 or 1828, to a well-off Irish family. He later dissipated his inheritance during a two-year London spree, almost certainly resided in France for a time (he spoke excellent French), and immigrated to the United States in late 1851, possibly to escape the consequences of an affair with a married woman.\n\nIn New York, where he lived throughout the 1850s, O’Brien quickly joined the loose sodality of flaneurs and freelance writers who called themselves Bohemians. By his own definition, true Bohemians rejected bourgeois society to “cultivate literature and debts, and, heedless of the necessities, fondly pursue the luxuries.” In his later years, Thomas Bailey Aldrich—by then one of the country’s most popular poets—would recall “how hurt I was on an occasion when O’Brien borrowed $35.00 off me, to pay a pressing bill, and, instead of paying the bill, gave a little dinner at Delmonico’s to which he did not invite me!” This was typical.\n\nO’Brien consistently dressed as a well-to-do gentleman, was often broke, seldom had any long-fixed abode, frequently drank evenings away at Pfaff’s beer cellar (which Walt Whitman also frequented), regularly got into fistfights (in one he had his nose badly broken), enjoyed practical jokes, and could never maintain the self-discipline needed to hold down a steady job. Better to live by one’s wits as a hack, despite the pittance paid to contributors by even the best magazines, Harper’s Monthly and The Atlantic. As a result, O’Brien needed to write quickly and steadily. In a novel by William North, a character transparently modeled after him is called Fitzgammon O’Bouncer: “A professional critic, he wrote brilliantly but falsely. His imagination dominated his judgment, and worst crime of all, he was superficial—worse yet, consciously superficial.”\n\nThat’s an exquisite put-down, but it’s rivaled by O’Brien’s own self-mocking humor. In a piece titled “Walk Up, Ladies!” he offers himself as the grand prize in a lottery sponsored by an (imaginary) association of eligible bachelors. He naturally catalogs the rare qualities he brings to this signal honor:\n\nI am…of medium height, while in my figure, symmetry and strength are harmoniously mingled. My nose and forehead form the Phidian line. My hands and feet are small and aristocratically shaped, and my eyes by turns melt with the soft emotions of the heart, or flash with the nobler passions of the hero. My hair is chestnut, and flows in long ringlets over my neck, somewhat like the hair of the Apollo Belvidere…. Words fail me in endeavoring to describe my whiskers and mustache. I have been informed by the most excellent female judges that even in their dreams they never imagined any thing more lovely. My accomplishments are varied.\n\nAfter the Civil War broke out in 1861, O’Brien could add “courage” to the list of his virtues. Proudly American and a staunch Unionist, he immediately enlisted and all too soon was shot during a kind of impromptu duel with a Confederate officer. After much suffering, Fitz-James O’Brien died in 1862 at the age of thirty-five.\n\nWhile O’Brien’s prose usually reflects the easy efficiency of the born journalist, one still pauses over his flair for striking phrases and bizarrely surreal imagery. A shark is likened to “the thin blade of a sharp knife, cutting through the water with a slow, even, deadly motion.” Perfect. But to describe a winter storm, he writes, “The large flakes fell sleepily through the dim blue air, like soft white birds that had been stricken with cold in the upper skies, and were sinking benumbed to earth.” (Hmm, cloudy with a chance of chickens?) I particularly love the title he originally proposed for a collection of his stories, “Flotsam and Jetsam—Things Lost by Shipwreck, or Thrown Overboard to Save the Vessel.”\n\nAs it happens, there was no collection of O’Brien’s work until 1881—nearly twenty years after his death—when his friend William Winter brought out The Poems and Stories of Fitz-James O’Brien. Following a section of reminiscences from now forgotten literati of the time, it reprinted over a hundred pages of O’Brien’s poetry and thirteen stories. In general, Winter emphasized the darker, more disturbing fiction.\n\nIn Studies in Classic American Literature, D.H. Lawrence counseled readers to “look through the surface of American art, and see the inner diabolism of the symbolic meaning.” In O’Brien’s case, the diabolism is often right on the surface. In one harrowing conte cruel, a loving wife and mother gradually becomes strangely moody, then one night tries to murder her husband as he sleeps. Why? he asks. “‘I was weary of you,’ she answered, in a cold even voice—a voice so level that it seemed to be spoken on ruled lines, ‘that is my reason.’”\n\nIn “The Lost Room” a man residing in a labyrinthine apartment building discovers that his room may exist in two (or more) dimensions. When he opens its door one evening he surprises guests dressed in eighteenth-century finery trading quips at an elegant dinner party. When he insists that these interlopers leave his room, one of them smugly asks the epistemological question, “How know you that it is your room?” The narrator has already heard rumors that some of the building’s inhabitants are cannibals or demons. Could these be they? Or might they be insidious enchanters? All his own belongings have vanished, but in their stead he glimpses expensive, more sophisticated versions of the originals:\n\nWherever my eyes turned they missed familiar objects, yet encountered strange representatives. Still in all the substitutes there seemed to me a reminiscence of what they replaced…. There lingered around them the atmosphere of what they once had been.\n\nAt the end of the story, the room disappears entirely, leaving only a blank wall.\n\nAgain and again, O’Brien likes to embed his reader inside a protagonist’s disordered mind, as in “The Hasheesh Eater,” or reveal the existential vertigo that results when the universe no longer makes sense, as in “Mother of Pearl.” In “Uncle and Nephew” the eponymous characters flip-flop between which of them is sane, which insane. Even O’Brien’s most gothicky tales eschew the then-typical gothic setting: instead of gloomy castles or the decaying House of Usher, he sets the action in cheap rooming houses in contemporary New York. You could actually visit the sites of the events he chronicles. We are told that the building in “What Was It?” is located on 26th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues; a note informs readers that they can soon see a plaster cast of the invisible monster’s head at a local museum.\n\nSuch localization, leisurely set forth, lulls the reader with its comforting familiarity—and only then does O’Brien introduce the ominous thing, the unsettling anomaly. To use Freud’s terminology, the heimlich (homey) suddenly grows unheimlich (uncanny). In some instances, the horrific or bizarre events turn out to have been only nightmares, drug-induced visions, or monomaniacal frenzies. This sort of bathetic letdown mars—some would say ruins—several otherwise terrifying shockers. As a writer, O’Brien regularly has trouble with plotting and especially with closure, which explains why so many of his works end abruptly or exist only as fragments.\n\nOne reason “The Diamond Lens” remains particularly admired lies in its being susceptible to varying interpretations. Consider no more than its first half. In the story’s opening pages the narrator, Linley, recounts his childhood obsession with microscopy, which began with the gift of a simple microscope from a distant cousin. As he recalls,\n\nI comprehended then for the first time the “Arabian Nights’ Entertainments.” The dull veil of ordinary existence that hung across the world seemed suddenly to roll away, and to lay bare a land of enchantments.\n\nTo satisfy the wishes of his family, he agrees to enroll in medical school, but never sets foot in a classroom or laboratory. Instead he expends all his resources in acquiring every possible instrument or accessory needed for advanced microscopic research.\n\nAlready in this set-up, O’Brien hints at two ways to understand what follows: we can believe the narrator utterly, or we can conclude that monomania has left him “enchanted,” that is, delusional. Most readers take the story as “real,” despite the implication of a statement such as this:\n\nIt was I who resolved the singular problem of rotation in the cells and hairs of plants into ciliary attraction, in spite of the assertions of Mr. Wenham and others, that my explanation was the result of an optical illusion.\n\nOf his later research Linley admits that\n\nlike all active microscopists, I gave my imagination full play. Indeed, it is a common complaint against many such, that they supply the defects of their instruments with the creations of their brains.\n\nAt this point, O’Brien presents Jules Simon, an urbane fellow tenant of Linley’s building who regularly persuades him to buy unneeded and overpriced knickknacks. The source of these supposed treasures is kept deliberately vague. As Linley says, “I came at length to the conclusion that this peddling was but a mask to cover some greater object.” What might that object be? One evening Simon mentions, with unusual enthusiasm, the séances of the spiritualist Madame Vulpes. She can reveal “the most astonishing things in the world.”\n\nAlmost immediately, Linley wonders whether she can help reveal astonishing things in the microscopic world. At their meeting, Madame Vulpes summons the spirit of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who tells his fellow microscopist that fame will be his if he creates a super-lens out of a 140-carat diamond. Totally disheartened, Linley realizes that such huge diamonds exist only in “the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs.”\n\nAfter returning home, Linley visits Simon, who is closely examining something that he quickly hides away. The normally self-possessed sophisticate behaves oddly, appearing nervous and jittery for no apparent reason. To “probe the mystery to the bottom,” Linley gets Simon drunk, then tricks him by saying he already knows his secret, so why hide it any longer? Reluctantly, or so it would seem, Simon shows him a large and lustrous diamond: “I could just gather from his drunken statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence was affected) that he had been superintending a gang of slaves engaged in diamond-washing in Brazil” and one day absconded with the stone and fled to New York. If this is true, why is Simon’s incoherence “affected”? Needless to say, the diamond, which he calls “The Eye of Morning,” weighs exactly 140 carats. “Here was an amazing coincidence. The hand of Destiny seemed in it.”\n\nI’ll stop there, except to add that Linley does create his diamond lens from the Eye of Morning, and it reveals a fresh, paradisical world in a droplet of water, one inhabited by a lovely human female. Unknowingly, Animula, as he calls her, becomes the adored object of his almost mystical ecstasies: “My whole life was absorbed in contemplation as rapt as that of any of the Romish saints.” Growing ever more hopelessly in thrall to his microscopic beloved, Linley berates himself that what he feels “is at best but a fantasy. Your imagination has bestowed on Animula charms which in reality she does not possess.” As a test, he visits a theater to see a celebrated dancer, said to be the most beautiful woman in the world. He finds her almost repulsive compared with the sylphlike perfection of his Animula. While there’s much more to the story, you can probably guess what will eventually happen.\n\nAt the story’s very end, Linley—like some character out of Poe—confesses that “They say now that I am mad; but they are mistaken.” Are they? O’Brien leaves this an open question. Perhaps Linley did see into another world, but enough clues have been planted to suggest that he might have been imagining everything. I suspect that O’Brien intended this ambiguity. As with Henry James’s “The Turn of the Screw,” we ask ourselves: What is real? Everything or nothing? How much is the product of an unstable imagination?\n\n“The Diamond Lens” might even incorporate an additional turn of the screw: Could Linley have been the dupe in a scam cooked up by Madame Vulpes and Jules Simon? It does seem that he has been subtly manipulated, first to consult the spiritualist, then to learn—so fortuitously—of a diamond weighing precisely 140 carats in the unlikely possession of his fellow tenant. Simon and Vulpes probably counted on Linley to pay whatever it took to acquire the gem, which was doubtless a fake of some sort. Alas, the con artists misjudged the ends to which the fanatical microscopist would go to further his research.\n\nH.L. Mencken once noted that Fitz-James O’Brien was the only significant artist to die in the Civil War. His best works really are significant, too, despite their shaky plotting and occasional smudges of mid-nineteenth-century melodrama. This “fabulous fantast,” as Sam Moskowitz called him in Explorers of the Infinite (1963), remains a crucial figure in American literature’s dominant fictional mode, which isn’t the novel but rather the romance. O’Brien’s stories can’t match the concentrated visionary power of Poe, the Calvinist moral intensity of Hawthorne, or the grim ironies of Bierce, but the best of them do come close. Yes, he is just a minor writer. But aren’t minor writers sometimes the ones we love the most?\n\nMichael Dirda is a Pulitzer Prize–winning critic for The Washington Post and the author of several collections of essays, including Classics for Pleasure and Browsings: A Year of Reading, Collecting, and Living with Books.

To this end, we focus on strengthening smaller models to perform well on agentic data science tasks as they currently struggle to compete with the large models.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a pipeline to first generate high-quality training data, then fine-tune an existing small model, and finally evaluate whether the model's performance improves on relevant benchmarks.\n\nLet’s begin with the last step: selecting a strong benchmark for evaluating models on data science tasks.\n\nIn order to understand if we are making progress towards better data science agents we need a benchmark to measure such capabilities. Last year, in partnership with Adyen, we introduced the DABStep benchmark: a way to evaluate data science agents on realistic tasks. The setup is simple: provide the LLM with datasets and ask it to answer non-trivial data questions.\n\nThis benchmark remains challenging for today’s LLMs — e.g. the best out-of-the-box model is Claude 4 Sonnet which reaches not even 20% accuracy on the hard tasks.\nYou can explore the live leaderboard here.\n\nNow that we identified a good benchmark we can try to climb it! We set out to build a dataset for fine-tuning such that even a small data agent model could perform well on DABStep.\n\nOur first choice was Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507: extremely small (fast to iterate with, easy to run), yet strong enough to act in agentic scenarios.\n\nNot great — but a promising starting point, since it left a lot of room for improvement. Let's see how we can improve it!\n\nA core aspect of agents that sets it apart from a pure chat model is the scaffolding built around the model to steer its behaviour. The evaluation script in DABStep for example uses smolagents to execute code. Smolagents comes with predefined behaviors, prompting structures, and expected formats.\n\nWe also studied the Qwen-Agent codebase, where the authors tailoring scaffolding to the model. This makes sense: Claude Code, for example, works shockingly well with Claude Sonnet because their scaffolding is aligned.\n\nSo, we restructured our scaffolding:\n\n👉 Check it out here: utils.py.\n\nResults: accuracy jumped from 44.4% → 59.7% (easy split). 🚀\n\nWith simplified scaffolding in place, we focused on fine-tuning Qwen3-4B for data science agentic tasks.\n\nThe recipe to improve a model on a certain task or behaviour is to train it on data that reflects the tasks as closely as possible. A natural starting point is to look at real Jupyter Notebooks and find notebooks that align closely with the task that we plan to tackle, namely data analysis.\n\nKaggle notebooks offer a wealth of high quality data analysis notebooks and are made available by Kaggle:\n\nNow that we have good results with a base model it's time to build a dataset that will help us improve it even further. We designed a multi-stage pipeline using Datatrove to clean and prepare Kaggle notebooks at scale.\n\nWe started with ~2TB of Kaggle notebooks and reduced it to ~250GB reusing our work from the BigCode project. As part of the StarCoder2 training data processing the notebooks (without output cells) were already deduplicated.\nMost Kaggle notebooks are small variations or near-identical copies, so this step was essential.\nKey insight: ~90% of raw notebooks are duplicates, which would have skewed training if left unfiltered.\n\nMost Kaggle notebooks reference external datasets via Kaggle metadata. To make sure the code inside notebooks could actually run, we built a pipeline that automatically fetched these linked datasets. This step was crucial, since many notebooks would otherwise be incomplete or non-executable.\n\nUsing the kagglehub package, we downloaded thousands of datasets — about 5TB in total. To keep things manageable and relevant:\n\nWe scored notebooks based on educational quality using Qwen3-32B. We saw that using the whole notebook was not optimal, as many contained trivial or broken code. Our educational scoring approach is detailed in edu_scoring.py.\n\nTL;DR: We assigned each notebook a score from 1–5 based on clarity, completeness, and educational value, and kept only those above a chosen threshold. This filtering removed about 70% of the notebooks.\n\nThis is similar to the insight from the BeyondWeb paper, which showed that using high-quality data is better for synthetic data generation — a step we relied on for QA (Question-Answer) generation.\nThis helped the model learn from “high quality” notebooks instead of noisy ones.\n\nWe excluded notebooks about training LLMs or unrelated to data analysis.\nWe also removed notebooks that didn’t actually use datasets through an automated LLM-based filtering process using Qwen3-32B. The implementation of filtering can be found in extract_packages_and_files.py.\n\nTL;DR: We prompted Qwen3-32B to identify and remove notebooks that either (1) had nothing to do with data analysis, or (2) didn’t actually use datasets. This step removed about 20% of the notebooks.\n\nThis ensured we trained only on relevant data science tasks.\n\nUsing the cleaned notebooks, we generated question–answer pairs using Qwen3-32B. The questions and answer are grounded in the real notebook traces so the QA pairs are based on real code execution results.\nPrompt design: we asked the LLM to produce natural questions that could realistically be asked of the dataset, then validated whether the notebook provided a correct answer.\n\nChallenge: We had to try many prompts to get higher-difficulty questions because LLMs tended to generate trivial ones like \"what is the size of the dataset\".\nInsight: We broke this into two steps because LLMs tended to hallucinate answers:\n\nThe complete prompting strategy and implementation is available in generate_qa.py.\n\nFinally we want to generate clean code execution traces since even the original notebooks after processing are often open ended and verbose with lots of irrelevant parts. However, we want our Jupyter Agent to get to the result efficiently. To generate cleaner notebook traces for training we generated traces synthetically based on the original notebooks.\nWe have prompted Qwen-3-Coder-480B model to generate a jupyter notebook code to answer the question from the previously generated synthetic QA pair. \nTraces captured step-by-step code execution, including intermediate outputs, which are crucial for agent training.\n\nWe used E2B for our agent to solve the synthetic QA pairs, which required fetching Kaggle datasets so the code could actually run via E2B.\n\nChallenge 1: Many datasets were unavailable.\nTrick: Since LLMs are strong at code and have a decent world model, we prompted them to act as a code interpreter when the dataset was missing.\n\nChallenge 2: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B model does not support thinking mode - how can we extract code commentary? By default it often outputs just a brief comment followed by several steps of code execution. However, we'd like some reasoning or comments between every cell. \nTrick: When switching from Qwen3-32B to Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B we noticed that often output message content was empty. This turns out to be a previously known quirk of Qwen3-Coder models in which when using tool calling the model would not return an empty assistant response. We enforce some text commentary through tooling by passing 'comment' as a required field in the code execution tool call. This way when non-reasoning model is used for code cell generation it will by default output some description of its actions from 1st POV, emulating the thinking traces structure.\n\nNote: the generated final answer in the notebook may vary from the answer specified in the QA pair. This is caused by the fact that the agent model could use data preprocessing methods and steps different from the original Kaggle notebook and the synthetic question would not usually specify them. This discrepancy is normal and lays the foundation for a new exciting research direction of how language models tend to treat data analysis and whether they do it differently from humans. For full transparency we keep both LLM-generated final answer and original answer from the real Kaggle notebook as a signal of model's performance. We encourage the community to try different dataset mixes to see how they can push performance even further.\n\nWe truncated overly long outputs and filtered out trivial traces to prevent content length issues and keep only high-quality traces.\nWe kept non-trivial, multi-turn traces aligned with DABStep-style tasks.\nThe resulting Jupyter Agent Dataset became the foundation for SFT on Qwen3-4B models with 51k synthetic notebooks and almost 0.2B tokens.\n\nWith this dataset in hand, the natural next step is to see whether it actually helps our model become a stronger data science agent. Let’s move on to the training pipeline and evaluate the impact!\n\nWith the curated dataset ready, we turned to the key question: does this data actually help the model get better at solving data analysis tasks?\nTo find out, we set up a simple fine-tuning pipeline and ran experiments to measure the impact of training on our synthetic notebooks.\n\nSome training steps turned out to be particularly interesting and gave us useful insights:\n\nOur complete training implementation, including hyperparameter configurations and template adaptations, is available in our finetuning directory in our repo.\n\nFirst, we generated our final dataset using Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B which contains high quality code and short reasoning-like traces. Afterwards, we started our training and we have experimented with various configurations like PEFT/adapters vs. full-parameter tuning, learning rate, number of epochs, adding noise and others. We found out, that full-parameter fine-tuning allows the model to learn and replicate the Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B behavior response quality better with shorter supporting commentary fitting more to the data analysis task without unnecessary long reasoning.\n\nWe have done a small ablation study on the impact of no. training epochs:\n\nWe observe that it is beneficial to have a bit more epochs than usual for SFT with lower learning rate and higher neftune noise (7). Finally, we compare our trained models with implemented scaffolding to define the pure impact of our training dataset. In summary, we can see up to 36%/22% boost on DABStep easy score compared with base/scaffolded model:\n\nWe can also see, that the hard score can increase too even though our dataset is focused on easier questions:\n\nFrom figures above one can notice a noticeable impact of both new scaffolding and tuning on our synthetic notebooks. This makes Qwen-4B (with our pipeline + scaffolding) a state-of-the-art small-model agent on DABStep.\n\nIn practice, the model can now solve a wide range of realistic Kaggle-style data analysis tasks with consistent execution.\nIt’s not yet strong enough for the hardest queries, but we’ve shown that even small models can become powerful agents when paired with the right data and scaffolding.\n\nThese results demonstrate that even small models can become powerful data science agents with the right training approach. Ready to try it yourself? We've made everything openly available so you can experiment with our fine-tuned models and dataset.\n\nWe openly release best-performing checkpoints of tuned Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 together with the training dataset, which you can try out and experiment with:\n\nYou can load Jupyter Agent Dataset in just a couple of lines using the following code:\n\nYou can also use sourced Kaggle datasets directly with E2B code execution using the following code:\n\nYou use tuned Jupyter Agent Qwen-based models following the Qwen documentation code:\n\nFor Thinking model you can decode both thinking response and content using the next code:\n\nMaybe this will lead to… Jupyter-Agent 3. 😉\n\nWe hope that our findings will inspire others to continue progress in developing more powerful notebook coding agents and we're excited to see what the community builds next.

The ministry sent a letter to X (formerly Twitter), the social media website owned by Elon Musk, pointing out failures in moderating AI-generated content on its platform. The ministry highlighted concerns that the Grok and other services of xAI have been used to generate and distribute obscene or non-consensual images, particularly targeting the dignity and privacy of women. Through the letter, the government has also sought a report on the actions taken by the company, and the immediate removal of illegal materials.ALSO READ | AI tool to 'undress women': Grok under fire for generating non-consensual sexualised images; Musk pokes funNow, X has submitted a reply to the ministry, however, the officials described it as ‘not adequate’, saying the response by the social media platform lacked specific actions taken and preventive steps implemented.Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had written to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, urging the government to urgently step in over what she described as a disturbing rise in the misuse of AI tools to sexualise women on social media, particularly on X.In her letter, Priyanka Chaturvedi called for strict “guardrails” on AI chatbots such as Grok, saying social media platforms must be made “a safe space for women”. She also underlined the need for better education of men from an early age to prevent such behaviour.“Have sought urgent attention and intervention of the IT Minister to take the issue of increasing incidents of AI apps being prompted to sexualise and undress women by unauthorised use of their images on social media,” Chaturvedi said in a post on X.In the letter shared publicly, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader flagged what she called an emerging trend on X, where men operating fake accounts allegedly upload photos of women and use AI prompts to minimise their clothing or sexualise them.“It is not just limited to sharing photos through fake accounts but are also targeting women who post their own photos,” she wrote.Calling the practice an “unacceptable and gross misuse of an AI function,” Chaturvedi also criticised Grok for “enabling this behaviour by adhering to such requests”.She described such acts as a “breach of women's right to privacy” and termed them “criminal”, adding that similar instances were “going absolutely unchecked” across other platforms as well.ALSO READ | Elon Musk's Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users after Deepfakes go viral across the world",

    "fullText": "Elizabeth Lopatto, writing at The Verge, “Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai Are Cowards”:\n\nSince X’s users started using Grok to undress women and\nchildren using deepfake images, I have been waiting for\nwhat I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s\nand Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet\ntells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim\nCook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of\nElon Musk.\n\nLopatto’s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google — and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies — are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It’s Trump, as president, they fear. Not Musk. And they are correct to fear Trump.\n\nYear one of Trump 2.0 has crystallized what had become — after decades of deliberate restraint after World War II, and even more so after the end of the Cold War — overlooked. The Presidency of the United States bestows upon its officeholder enormous, unparalleled, power. No one was afraid of Trump after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. The man was convicted of 34 felonies in a cold New York City courtroom in May 2024, a mere 19 months ago. Trump expected and asked for riots outside the courtroom. He got nothing but pathetic support from a handful of kooks. A year earlier, he lost a humiliating sexual assault civil lawsuit to E. Jean Carroll. Trump, just a year and a half ago, was a buffoon getting his mug shot taken. Today he’s arguing that his power is unchecked by anything other than his own sense of morality.\n\nNo other president has ever abused (or, if you support him, wielded) the powers of the office like Trump has. The power and influence of Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEOs of two of the top five companies in the world, isn’t merely superseded by Trump’s power and influence as president. Their power and influence are dwarfed by Trump’s. Any credible argument about how they should act must acknowledge that profound imbalance.\n\nI never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever\nagain. The next time Tim Cook says “privacy is a human\nright,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face.\nI mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has\ncreated an undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good,\nthe mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How do you plan\nto defend getting rid of the ICEBlock app while allowing X\nto generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and\nGoogle even identify their values beyond their commitment to\n“shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?\n\nThe profound power imbalance here is frustrating. But also terrifying. It’s folly to think these CEOs should steer their companies into direct confrontation with Trump. It would do no ultimate good for Apple or Google to burn themselves to the ground in protest. These men aren’t beholden to shareholders, per se. They’re doing their duty to institutions they’ve devoted their lives to. Companies that are worth preserving and protecting. Perhaps not in your estimation, but certainly from theirs.\n\nBut abject obsequiousness — which more and more seems the path Cook and Pichai are choosing — is no more justifiable a response than corporate suicide. The situation is not binary: acquiescence or war. There is a broad middle ground, founded on principle.\n\nDisney’s response to the Jimmy Kimmel controversy a few months ago shows the way. Defend the company’s principles while simultaneously defending the company from Trump’s demented wrath. You can take the position of “Fuck you, make me” without ever saying those words. Objection is not confrontation. Do the right thing and enforce the App Store and Play Store guidelines, and remove X and Grok from the stores. Make Musk object. Make the Trump administration object. Make them defend the indefensible — in public. Make clear why the apps were removed from the app stores and force Musk — and Trump, if he chooses — to argue that those things are A-OK by them. In court.\n\nThe judicious path for Apple and Google (and every other U.S. company) may well be to obey the law, even when the law is being actively corrupted. But the correct path is not to obey in advance. Stand behind the law while the law still exists on your side. Disney resisted Trump’s preposterous demand that they fire Jimmy Kimmel without lasting controversy, simply by standing firm in their conviction. Apple and Google could certainly do the same regarding apps that are being used to generate CSAM and deepfake harassment, regardless if the apps are part of the private fiefdom of Trump’s ally Elon Musk. It’s wise for Cook and Pichai to pick their battles. This one, I think, is worth picking. This is a moment when the App Store and Play Store can stand firmly on the side of longstanding and correct societal norms.",

The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,\" Yao said at an AI ‍conference in Beijing.\n\nChina has completed a working prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine potentially capable of producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips that rival the West's, Reuters reported last month. However, the machine has not yet produced working chips and may not do ​so until 2030, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nYao and other Chinese industry ‌leaders at the Beijing conference on Saturday also acknowledged that the U.S. maintains an advantage in computing power due to its hefty investments in infrastructure.\n\n\"The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours.

In the Go-Go years, typically 65 to 75, healthy young retirees spend big on scratching life-long dreams off their bucket list — and tend to make big purchases that could lead to regrets.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nJ.P. Morgan’s Retirement by the Numbers report found that average retiree spending gradually declines by over 30% between the ages of 60 and 85, as they enter and exit the Go-Go and Slow-Go years (1).\n\nAccording to AARP, some of the top spending regrets retirees are likely to have include expensive trips, upsizing to their dream house, purchasing fancy cars, boats or RVs and some impulse online shopping.\n\nWhile it’s important to manage your retirement savings well, you shouldn’t be afraid to spend money on the retirement of your dreams if you plan accordingly. Here are three ways to prepare your finances for retirement while ensuring you can still enjoy the newfound freedom it brings.\n\nThe U.S. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the annual inflation rate increased by 2.7% in November 2025 (2). With the economy still on shaky ground, your 401(k) or IRA — and your retirement itself — could be at risk.\n\nA Gold IRA can offer a great way to protect and grow your nest egg, so you have the extra cash available for a dream purchase in those early retirement years. Unlike the U.S. dollar, which has lost 87% of its purchasing power since 1971, gold’s value has increased over the last few years.\n\nIn fact, investors have been flocking to safe-haven assets like gold over the past year to protect their portfolios amid a volatile economic backdrop. Gold prices surged by nearly 70% over this period, outpacing the S&P 500 index’s 17.6% return (3).",

    "description": "The U.S. is considering buying Greenland to secure its strategic interests in the Arctic, as Russia and China invest heavily in the region, and a negotiated transfer with compensation for Denmark would be the most effective way to secure the territory without resorting to force.",
    "fullText": "The White House is speaking loudly about Greenland. But volume should not be mistaken for madness. This isn’t a sudden lapse into imperial fantasy — it is power politics, plain and unsentimental, dressed in modern language but driven by old truths.\n\nGeography still governs fate. Distance can still protect or imperils nations. Ice still melts, routes still open, and rivals still move. Greenland sits at the center of it all — a vast slab of territory that dominates the map not by population, but by consequence.\n\nSet aside the outrage and the pearl-clutching, and the case becomes clear. Seen through a realist lens — the kind John Mearsheimer describes — power is never polite. Nations do not glide through history on good will. They compete, maneuver, and block rivals wherever they can.\n\nAmerica didn’t invent this contest, but it has played it for a century, shaping trade routes, locking down strategic chokepoints, and denying rivals room to expand. Exiting now would not end the game — it would simply forfeit the advantage.\n\nGreenland matters because the Arctic matters. Melting ice has turned what was once a frozen buffer into a contested corridor. Shipping lanes are emerging. Subsea cables snake across the ocean floor. Missile paths shorten. Surveillance gaps narrow. Russia knows this. China knows this. Both are investing heavily in Arctic presence, infrastructure and influence. The U.S. can either treat Greenland as a distant curiosity or as what it actually is: a forward position in a region that will define future power balances.\n\nThis is why the talk of acquiring it refuses to die. Under Trump, it has resurfaced less from recklessness than from bluntness. He says aloud what others preferred to bury in briefings. Previous administrations whispered the same concerns behind closed doors, then settled for half-measures and cosmetic compromises. Trump simply said the quiet part out loud, with his usual lack of decorum and surplus of disruption. Allies recoiled. But in cold political terms, offense is secondary to advantage.\n\nThe preferred path is obvious and needs no justification. Buying Greenland is better than bullying it. A negotiated transfer, with guarantees for Greenlanders and compensation for Denmark, would be cleaner, cheaper, and far less destabilizing than any military move. War in the Arctic would be absurd, expensive and counterproductive. Even floating the idea of force is less about intent than leverage. It is a reminder that the U.S. takes the matter seriously, not a rehearsal for invasion.\n\nCritics insist Greenland’s future is not Washington’s to decide. Formally, they are right. Strategically, however, that statement is comforting nonsense. In a world of rising rivalry, no great power allows vital terrain to drift into adversarial hands out of courtesy. Sovereignty is sacred until security is threatened; then it becomes negotiable. This isn’t cynicism, but the hard ledger of history.\n\nThe U.S. bought Louisiana not out of generosity, but to deny France control of the Mississippi. It backed Panama’s break from Colombia to secure a canal it deemed vital. It purchased Alaska to keep Russia away from its doorstep. Britain took Gibraltar for the same reason: Position beats principle when survival is involved. States talk reverently about borders, right up until borders threaten them. When security tightens, ideals are revised.\n\nThe European backlash, while predictable, is also revealing. Europe benefits enormously from American security guarantees, but recoils whenever Washington acts like a power rather than a charity. There is something faintly comic about NATO allies warning the U.S. against taking its own defense too seriously. The alliance rests, after all, on the assumption that America has never been a feelings-first power. Greenland reveals whether it still remembers that.\n\nEuropean nations insist Greenland is not for sale, while quietly relying on American troops, money and missiles to keep the peace that permits such comfortable posturing. It is a bit like lecturing the fire brigade on property rights while borrowing their hoses. Principles are easier to defend when someone else pays the insurance.\n\nThe deeper issue is not Trump’s rhetoric but America’s reluctance to admit what it is. The U.S. remains a global power in a competitive world. It cannot afford strategic blind spots disguised as virtue. Greenland is not a vanity project or a colonial hangover — it is a strategic anchor, a surveillance platform, a logistical hub, and a denial asset, all wrapped up into one. To lose influence there would not cause immediate collapse, but it would mark a significant retreat, the kind rivals notice long before voters do.\n\nThat is why this moment feels different. The language is sharper. The signals are stronger. Force remains the last resort, and rightly so. It is expensive, corrosive and unpredictable. Buying Greenland would cost money and pride, but far less than conflict. Realism doesn’t require hostility. The United States has often secured vital positions without resorting to force.\n\nIt gained long-term access to Iceland during World War II because the island mattered more than diplomatic niceties. It maintained strategic basing in Okinawa through negotiation, despite local resistance, because geography demanded it. It built Diego Garcia into a major military hub through negotiation and agreement rather than force. In each case, American security was strengthened without open conflict.\n\nGreenland deserves the same treatment now. Serious talks that reflect its importance. Offer fair payment to Denmark, respect local self-rule, and protect U.S. interests without turning the Arctic into an unnecessary flashpoint. Trump has his sights set on Greenland because the map leaves little room for alternatives.\n\nJohn Mac Ghlionn is a writer and researcher who explores culture, society and the impact of technology on daily life.",

They would not, however, sell us the floor sample and either ship it immediately from that store or let us pick it up.\n\nInstead, they wanted us to pay for the item, which they would ship from a central warehouse. We balked at that, because in my 30 years of covering retail, I've seen way too many people not get items they paid for after a bankruptcy filing.\n\nThat has been happening with American Signature Furniture/Value City Furniture customers, I reported Jan. 9. Customers have been reporting that they have not received the merchandise they have paid for, nor have they received refunds.\n\nNow, the chain has shared in a press release and on its website that all stores are closing.\n\nWhen Value City Furniture's parent company, American Signature Furniture, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November, it intended to reorganize, according to documents filed on PacerMonitor.\n\n“In order to maximize value, the company has commenced a sale process pursuant to Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the hope of a competitive auction within approximately 45 days to elicit higher value for the benefit of all stakeholders. ASI expects to enter into a stalking horse asset purchase agreement with ASI Purchaser LLC under which, subject to court approval, ASI Purchaser LLC will acquire substantially all of the company’s assets and assume certain related liabilities,” it shared in a press release.\n\nThat process has culminated in the decision to close all locations after going-out-of-business sales. That news greeted visitors to the chain's website on Jan. 10.\n\n\"Closing Sales Now Underway at All American Signature Furniture and Value City Furniture Locations,\" the company shared.\n\nIt shared some color as to what happened during the bankruptcy process.\n\n\"In November 2025, American Signature Inc. began a court-supervised process to facilitate a sale. As a result of this process, American Signature Inc. is winding down operations and closing all remaining American Signature Furniture and Value City Furniture locations. Closing sales will continue while inventory lasts,\" it added.\n\n\"Since the end of the COVID boom, the combination of high interest rates and inflation have worked concurrently to stifle the housing market and limit consumers’ disposable income levels. Then, those issues were further compounded this year by rising costs on imports due to round after round of tariffs,\" Furniture Today reported.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump laid into Republican Senator Susan Collins in an expletive-laden phone call after she voted against one of his top priorities.\n\nThe president reportedly made a “profanity-laced” call to the vulnerable Republican senator on Thursday, sources told The Hill. Collins was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act from committee to the floor, which passed in a 52-47 vote earlier in the day.\n\n“He was very mad about the vote,” the source told The Hill. “Very mad. Very hot.”\n\nThe resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela following the U.S. capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. This throws a wrench in Trump’s plans to seize Venezuela’s oil.\n\nThe source told The Hill that the president “basically read her the riot act,” in a phone call that came “out of the blue.” Collins’ office confirmed to The Hill that the call took place, but did not include any additional details on what the president said. The Daily Beast reached out to the senator’s representatives and the White House for comment.\n\nIn addition to Collins, Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young also voted to advance the war powers resolution. The move made Trump irate. He posted at length about the five conservative lawmakers on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump wrote. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nCollins is up for reelection this year and faces a tight race as Democratic challengers gain in popularity. Her seat will be important for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate after the midterms. However, Trump has been a thorn in his party’s side, openly expressing his desire to see Collins out. This latest call appears to reaffirm his animosity toward the senator.\n\n“The president obviously is unhappy with the vote,” Collins told reporters following Trump’s ire. “I guess this means that he would prefer to have Gov. Mills or somebody else with whom he’s not had a great relationship. I don’t know, I’m just not going to comment.”\n\nThe president has faced pressure and criticism following the operation in Venezuela that ended in Maduro’s capture. While Maduro sits in custody awaiting trial, Trump has announced plans for the U.S. to “run” Venezuela and sell millions of barrels of its oil.\n\nTrump met with major oil executives from companies like Chevron and Exxon on Friday to discuss Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. However, the president, 79, quickly veered off-topic, pausing the meeting to wax poetic about the White House ballroom currently under construction.",

The spacecraft system’s four-mile journey from the assembly building to Launch Pad 39B will take up to 12 hours. NASA is targeting a date no earlier than January 17, with the exact day depending on the weather and on the possible need for additional time to address technical issues.Artemis 2 is the first crewed mission to the moon since the Apollo program’s final flight in 1972. The 10-day mission will have four astronauts on board who’ll be testing if Orion’s critical life support systems can sustain human passengers on future longer duration missions. They will first orbit the Earth twice before making their way 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon. If the SLS and Orion system is rolled out as planned, NASA intends to conduct a wet dress rehearsal at the end of January.

    "fullText": "T-Mobile, one of the top phone carriers in the U.S., is shifting its strategy as it battles increased customer losses and tougher competition from its growing list of rivals.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, T-Mobile's postpaid phone churn rate (the number of customers who cancel their phone service) reached 0.89%, which is 3 basis points higher than the churn it reported for the same quarter last year, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nThe concerning loss of loyal customers comes after T-Mobile implemented price increases and phone plan changes throughout the year, which sparked backlash. It also comes during a time when the company’s top competitors, Verizon and AT&T, have both been launching free perks and phone deals to attract customers.\n\nCable companies, such as Spectrum and Xfinity, have also been luring customers away from traditional phone carriers by offering discounted phone plans when bundled with TV and internet.\n\nAs the wireless market becomes increasingly competitive, more consumers are exploring various options for more affordable phone plans outside their current provider, especially as they grapple with rising monthly bills, according to a recent survey from Oxio.\n\nApproximately 90% of consumers would consider alternatives to traditional carriers.\n\nAdditionally, 85% consider cost to be a primary factor in selecting a mobile provider.\n\nAdditionally, 46% of consumers rank a lower-priced plan as their main reason for switching providers, while 33% prioritize better network coverage.\n\n“The research shows that many consumers are looking for greater plan clarity and value – they want services that match what they actually use,” said Oxio CcxEO Nicolas Girard in a statement. “We’re seeing a strong interest in personalization, transparency, and more control over mobile services.”\n\nAmid this growing trend, T-Mobile has introduced a new phone plan that it claims is its “most value-packed plan ever,” according to a recent press release.\n\nT-Mobile’s new “Better Value” phone plan starts at $140 a month for three lines with autopay, meaning each line is $46 for families, plus taxes and fees.\n\nThe plan also includes a five-year price-lock guarantee on talk, text and data. It also features unlimited premium data on T-Mobile’s 5G network and unlimited hotspot data, which includes 250GB of high-speed hotspot data every month (600 kbps after).\n\nCustomers will also have unlimited data abroad, specifically 30GB of high-speed data per month (256 kbps after) in over 215 countries and destinations. Satellite connectivity is also included with unlimited text and data via satellite-optimized apps.\n\nSome perks attached to the plan include free Netflix and Hulu subscriptions, and Apple TV for $3 per month. It also offers home internet backup for an additional $10 per month with autopay (plus taxes and fees), and two-year device upgrades.\n\nT-Mobile stated that its Better Value plan will save families over $1,000 compared to similar plans from AT&T and Verizon, thanks to these “built-in benefits.” It also stated that existing T-Mobile customers looking to upgrade from their Essentials family plan with three or more lines can save over $50 a month on benefits by switching to its Better Value plan.\n\n“Families are looking for ways to save and get more value from the services they rely on every day, especially wireless,” said Mike Katz, T-Mobile chief business and product officer, in the press release. “While AT&T and Verizon keep asking people to pay more for less, we’re doing the opposite.”\n\nCurrently, depending on the plan tier, Verizon charges customers about $100 to $175 per month for three lines on its unlimited plans (with autopay activated and before taxes and fees). They also come with a three-year price-lock guarantee.\n\nAT&T charges families roughly $138 to $183 per month, depending on the plan tier, for three lines on its unlimited plans. These prices are also before taxes and fees, and with the monthly autopay discount activated.\n\nThe move from T-Mobile follows its launch of a new initiative last month called “15 Minutes to Better,” which ensures that consumers can switch phone carriers in 15 minutes or less.\n\nThe switching process is completed through either T-Mobile’s T-Life app or website, where consumers can sign in to their current plan from a rival phone carrier using the company’s “Easy Switch” tool, which will match them with a competitive T-Mobile offer.\n\nT-Mobile has been stepping up its game to compete with Verizon and AT&T, as they are all nearly neck-and-neck in terms of market share in the wireless telecommunications industry.\n\nT-Mobile announces free offer for Verizon and AT&T customers\n\n​​Verizon CEO sounds alarm on why customers are leaving in droves\n\nSpectrum raises red flag on cause of fleeing customer problem\n\nCurrently, T-Mobile owns 20.8% market share in the industry, while Verizon owns 23.8% and AT&T owns 19.4%, according to data from market research company IBISWorld, which was shared with TheStreet.\n\nT-Mobile has also been facing the growing threat of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs). These wireless providers lease network capacity, offering more competitive pricing to consumers, compared to traditional phone carriers, and they have higher satisfaction rates, according to a recent survey from J.D. Power.\n\nT-Mobile has a consumer satisfaction score of 636 (on a 1,000-point scale)for its postpaid plans, surpassing Verizon and AT&T, which have scores of 583 and 573, respectively.\n\nHowever, MVNOs have an average satisfaction score of 641.\n\nSpecifically, Consumer Cellular has a score of 726, while Google Fi Wireless has a score of 671.\n\n“The findings show that value is the most important driver of the overall experience, followed closely by service quality,” said Carl Lepper, senior director of technology, media and telecom at J.D. Power, in a press release.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Rams entered Saturday evening’s joust with the Panthers as heavy favorites. Among the biggest reasons why was star hurler Matthew Stafford. Los Angeles’ veteran signal-caller authored an MVP-caliber campaign, amassing a league-leading total in passing touchdowns and passing yards.\n\nAgainst Carolina, Stafford appeared destined to recreate his regular-season success. He successfully tossed arrows all across the Bank of America Stadium plains in the first two quarter, conjuring spells against the Panthers' weary defense.\n\nStafford's performance faded as the match wore on, felled by an inspired Carolina rearguard and an apparent hand injury. Nevertheless, his first-half showing was enough to see him climb up the Rams’ record books.\n\nWith that, here’s a look at Stafford’s performance vs. Carolina by the numbers.\n\nMORE: Why Rico Dowdle split reps with Chuba Hubbard vs. Rams\n\nHalftime score: Rams 17, Panthers 14\n\nStafford put forth an impressive display in the first half, collecting yardage in bunches. He connected with Puka Nacua for one score and set the BYU alum up for another, although the play was eventually ruled a run play.\n\nStafford's efficiency was noteworthy. He found his target on eight of his first nine throws, producing a passer rating that would rank as one of the best in postseason history.\n\nAll that amounted to an efficient and effective first half showing for Stafford, who reiterated his MVP credentials with another glistening display — this time, under the playoff lights.\n\nMORE: Meet Matthew Stafford’s wife, Kelly, along with his four daughters\n\nStafford's first-half outburst surged him to the top of Los Angeles' postseason record books. He became the Rams' all-time leading playoff passer against the Panthers, eclipsing a host of icons — including Kurt Warner — to take the title of best postseason hurler in franchise history.\n\nMORE: Puka Nacua stats performance vs. Panthers\n\nHere's a look at where he stands on the Rams' all-time list:\n\nWhile Stafford enjoyed another sterling day under the lights, the numbers he accrue throughout the postseason will not count towards his MVP candidacy. Votes for the famous award have already been filed, meaning that Stafford cannot actually improve his chances at landing the prize.\n\nSN's expert predictions for NFL playoffs, Super Bowl 60\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nStafford is a Super Bowl champion, having hoisted the hardware in 2022 after leading Los Angeles to a 23-20 win over the Bengals in Super Bowl 56.\n\nStafford wasn't quite faultless in his showing. He tossed two interceptions on the day, seeing his patented efficiency slow amid Cincinnati's harrowing pass rush.\n\nStill, his final line was reflective of one of his generation's best gunslingers: 26-of-40 passing for 283 yards, three touchdowns and two picks.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMatthew Stafford enjoyed a sizzling start during the Rams’ joust with the Panthers in Saturday’s wild-card game. Los Angeles’ wily veteran completed eight of his first nine passes, setting up Puka Nacua with a touchdown as the Rams opened a 14-point advantage over their heavily favored opposition.\n\nBut as the game wore on and Carolina built its way back into the contest, things changed for Stafford. Plays that once appeared routine for the 37-year-old proved far more challenging. Incompletions piled up for the MVP frontrunner, leaving many uncertain about what had changed.\n\nFox’s broadcast crew suggested Stafford’s struggles weren’t organic, but rather the result of an injury to his throwing hand. While the malady might not fully explain some of Stafford’s uncharacteristic mistakes, it could provide some context for his foibles.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Stafford’s status following his alleged hand injury.\n\nThings were humming for Stafford in the first half. The Super Bowl champion laced passes all about the Bank of America Stadium pitch, finding his target with increasing regularity.\n\nBut partway through the second quarter, Stafford was momentarily cut down by injury. As he attempted a throw, he hit his hand on the crown of an onrushing Carolina defender.\n\nMatthew Stafford appeared to have hurt his hand in the first half ⬇️\n\n📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/QQo0FHNW0N\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 10, 2026\n\nStafford gripped his hand and grimaced as he rose off the turf, flexing his hand tightly. His efficiency faded as the game wore on, with incompletions — and an interception — spilling into his previously faultless display.\n\nThere was a marked difference in Stafford's showing before and after his apparent injury. Stafford started the day flawless — 8-of-8 for 107 yards and one touchdown. After clattering his hand against the Panthers rusher, he went 16-of-34 with 197 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Noted for his patented efficiency, Stafford's throws lost their luster slightly as the game continued. He found his form when it counted, though, finding Cody Parkinson with a delicate toss in the corner of the end zone to deliver a four-point win to Los Angeles.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Indiana Hoosiers are on the doorstep of college football history, carrying an unbeaten season into the national championship game with a chance to accomplish something no modern team ever has.\n\nAt 15-0, Indiana is already one of just five teams in the modern era to reach that mark. A win against the Miami Hurricanes would make the Hoosiers the first major college football program to finish 16-0 since Yale Bulldogs accomplished the feat in 1894 — an era of leather helmets and no forward pass.\n\nWhat makes Indiana’s run even more remarkable is how it was built. The Hoosiers entered the season without a single five-star recruit, leaning instead on development and precision under second-year coach Curt Cignetti. Once one of the most consistent rebuild jobs in the Big Ten, Indiana is now one win from the most dominant single season in program history.\n\nMore: Fernando Mendoza's family ties to Mario Cristobal run deep with Miami homecoming\n\nIndiana announced itself on the sport’s biggest stage with a 56-22 dismantling of the Oregon Ducks in the Peach Bowl.

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Hayes Fawcett, the Texas Longhorns have landed a commitment from linebacker Rasheem Biles out of the NCAA transfer portal. Biles spent the last two seasons with the Pitt Panthers, turning into an All-ACC player. Steve Sarkisian and new defensive coordinator Will Muschamp now take over his talents, hoping it translates in the SEC.\n\nLinebacker has been a position of importance for Texas in the transfer portal this offseason. There has been plenty of turnover there, both due to the 2026 NFL Draft and guys leaving for other schools. Somebody with the ability to bring an immediate impact was needed in Austin, and Biles is the guy.\n\nBiles played in 10 games last season for Pitt, starting in nine of them. A total of 101 tackles, 17 tackles for a loss, and 4.5 interceptions proved to be good enough for second-team All-ACC honors. You can add in two interceptions (both of which were returned for touchdowns), six passes defended, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. Basically, Biles was all over the field this past year.\n\nIf those stats were not enough, the On3 Industry Transfer Portal rankings believe one of the very best is heading to Texas. Biles is a four-star prospect and the No. 16 overall player to enter this cycle. Nobody is ranked higher when it comes to the linebacker position, either.\n\nPlenty of other schools were interested in Biles’ commitment during the transfer process. The likes of Colorado, Miami, Michigan, and Ohio State were a part of the discussion at one point. Instead, Texas found a way to get this one over the finish line.\n\nThe Longhorns are coming off a disappointing season, going 9-3 and missing the College Football Playoff. Sarkisian is working to retool the roster so the same fate is not shared at the conclusion of the 2026 season. Plenty of work remains but snagging somebody like Biles is a massive step in the right direction.\n\nTexas will open the ’26 campaign on Sept. 5 vs. Texas State, where you can assume it will be debut day for Biles. One week later will grab all the attention, though, as Ohio State comes to Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium for the first time since 2006.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Rico Dowdle was the team’s leading rusher, with 1,076 yards and six rushing touchdowns, plus contributed 297 receiving yards and a touchdown through the air, and he’s hitting free agency. Christian Rozeboom, the Panthers’ tackles leader who also had two sacks, three pass break-ups, a pick and a forced fumble, will also become a free agent when the new league year ends.

Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe are grateful to the International Tax Policy Forum for financial support of this project.

    "description": "Why the doomsayers are wrong: npm, PyPI, and NuGet downloads are exploding",
    "fullText": "Earlier this week, Adam Wathan, the creator of Tailwind CSS, dropped a bombshell about how AI has impacted his company and its employees:\n\nthe reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. And every second I spend trying to do fun free things for the community like this is a second I’m not spending trying to turn the business around and make sure the people who are still here are getting their paychecks every month.\n\nThe reaction was swift and predictable. Hot takes flooded in declaring the death of open source, the end of OSS sustainability, and the AI apocalypse that would render libraries and frameworks obsolete. Geoffrey Huntley captured the prevailing narrative perfectly1:\n\n“AI can generate code, bypassing the need to deal with open-source woes… I’ve found myself using less open source these days… This shift challenges the role of open-source ecosystems.”\n\nI had a tweet about the Tailwind situation go viral and there were dozens of quote tweets and comments echoing the very same. “AI eats open source” is easy to find in abundance online.\n\nHere’s the problem: everyone is getting this perfectly backwards.\n\nAI isn’t killing open source. It’s amplifying it to unprecedented levels. The Tailwind situation isn’t about declining OSS adoption - it’s about a business model that was working great in a world where learning curves were high and documentation was the bottleneck. That world is gone, and the revenue model built on top of it is collapsing. But the underlying Tailwind library? It’s thriving.\n\nLet me show you why the doomsayers are wrong, backed by actual data from our own experience with Akka.NET and broader ecosystem trends that tell a very different story.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a two-part series. This post covers why AI is accelerating open source adoption, not killing it. Part 2 examines which business models thrive and which collapse in the AI era - and what Tailwind’s situation teaches us about adapting. \n\nI’ve been maintaining Akka.NET, a complex distributed systems framework, for over a decade. If AI was going to kill any open source project, it should have be ours. Actor model? Message-passing? Concurrency? Distributed systems? This is exactly the kind of “complex stuff” that AI should supposedly generate on the fly, right?\n\nWe’re not an outlier. Let me show you three very different frameworks - all thriving:\n\nTailwind CSS - The framework at the center of this controversy:\n\nTailwind more than doubled its downloads in 2025. The framework that supposedly proves AI is killing open source had its best year ever - by a massive margin.\n\nNServiceBus - Enterprise messaging framework (15+ years old, commercial licensing):\n\nNServiceBus is exactly the kind of enterprise infrastructure Geoffrey Huntley expects AI to replace. And it’s growing at 35%+ annually - the same rate as before AI coding tools existed. And it’s been commercially licensed for years - surely someone who wanted this type of functionality would just fire up Claude Code to eliminate it, right?\n\nAccording to Sonatype’s State of the Software Supply Chain 20242 report:\n\nIf AI was replacing open source libraries, why are package downloads exploding at unprecedented rates? Why are dependency counts climbing? Why is every major package registry showing record growth?\n\nThe answer is simple: AI is discovering and adopting open source libraries faster than humans ever could.\n\nHere’s what the AI doomsayers fundamentally misunderstand about how Large Language Models work: they’re trained to find the shortest path to a working solution.\n\nWhen you ask Claude or GPT-5 to build a distributed system, what do you think is the shorter path?\n\nOption A: Generate thousands of lines of custom actor model implementation, cluster management, network protocols, failure detectors, and state replication logic - all from scratch, all needing testing, all potentially buggy.\n\nOption B: dotnet add package Akka and configure the proven, tested, battle-hardened framework that’s in the training data with millions of examples.\n\nThe LLM isn’t stupid. It’s going to pick Option B every single time, unless you explicitly tell it not to - and even then it might fight you3.\n\nThis is why the “AI will generate everything custom” narrative falls apart on contact with reality. Yes, AI can generate custom components. But developers don’t want custom CSS frameworks - they want to ship. They want the thing that makes them money shipped yesterday. Using established libraries is how you get there expeditiously.\n\nHere’s where it gets really interesting. Established open source projects have a massive, compounding advantage in the AI era: years of training data.\n\nThink about what’s in those training sets:\n\nEvery time someone asks “how do I build a distributed system in .NET?” the training data screams “AKKA.NET” across thousands of documents. The LLM doesn’t need to think creatively. It’s pattern matching against an enormous corpus of successful implementations.\nThis creates a virtuous cycle:\n\nPopular projects have more training data → LLMs recommend them more → More people use them → More training data gets created → The cycle continues.\n\nThe rich get richer, and in this case, that’s actually a good thing for software quality.\n\nNow compare that to generating a custom solution. The LLM has… what? Generic distributed systems theory? Sure. But where are the battle-tested examples? Where are the debugging sessions? Where are the “here’s what went wrong in production and how we fixed it” stories?\n\nThey don’t exist. Because you’re asking the AI to invent something new.\n\nRemember when adopting a new library meant:\n\nFor a human developer, that’s a full day or two of investment before you’re productive. The mental math was always: “Is learning this library worth the time investment vs. building something custom that I already understand?”\n\nAI just arbitraged that entire calculation out of existence.\n\nWhen I ask Claude to “implement an Akka.NET cluster with cluster sharding and split-brain resolution,” it doesn’t need to read the docs. It doesn’t need the tutorial. It usually outputs working code with proper configuration in seconds. The learning curve is effectively zero.\n\nThis fundamentally changes the adoption math. The barrier to using any established library is now “can the AI generate correct code for it?” If yes, adoption becomes frictionless.\n\nGuess which libraries have the most examples for AI to learn from? The established ones. The popular ones. The ones with network effects and community momentum.\n\nAI can generate impressive things from scratch. People have used agentic loops to build entire programming languages, compilers, and complex systems - all generated by AI with minimal human intervention. These are genuine technical achievements that prove AI can build sophisticated software.\n\nBut here’s the question nobody’s asking: would you run your production systems on them?\n\nThe answer depends entirely on blast radius - what happens when things go wrong4.\n\nThe libraries that AI can safely replace are the ones with low blast radius. If your AI-generated UI component looks a little funny or renders slightly different than expected, nobody dies. You fix it and move on. The cost of failure is measured in minutes of debugging.\n\nBut if your AI-generated embedded operating system core dumps constantly? Someone might actually die. If your AI-generated authentication library has a subtle flaw? You get breached. If your AI-generated distributed consensus algorithm has an edge case bug? You lose data across your entire cluster.\n\nProduction systems don’t run on “technically works” - they run on battle-hardened, community-tested, security-audited infrastructure that’s been proven across thousands of deployments over years. That’s React. Linux. PostgreSQL. Akka.NET. NServiceBus. The boring, reliable stuff that’s growing 35-126% annually.\n\nThere’s another dimension here: institutionalized experience.\n\nA venerable codebase like Akka.NET doesn’t just contain code - it contains decades of accumulated wisdom across millions of deployments and tens of thousands of applications. All running on different hardware, serving different use cases, developed by different people. Every bug fix is a production war story. Every edge case handler is a lesson learned the hard way. Every configuration option exists because someone, somewhere, needed it in production.\n\nLLMs can synthesize code. They can pattern-match against training data. But they are no substitute for thousands of person-years of lived experience encoded into a codebase. That wisdom doesn’t exist in the training data - it exists in the accumulated decisions of maintainers who’ve seen every way a distributed system can fail.\n\nWhen you dotnet add package Akka, you’re not just getting code. You’re getting the institutional memory of a decade of production deployments. AI can’t generate that. It can only recommend the libraries that already have it.\n\nThe libraries actually at risk from AI generation are the ones with low blast radius - simple utilities, UI components, basic tooling where failure is cheap and recoverable. The critical infrastructure where failure is catastrophic? That’s not going anywhere. It’s accelerating.\n\n“Sure,” I hear you saying, “AI won’t replace frameworks, but what about all the smaller libraries? What about utilities and helpers?”\n\nFair question. Let’s think through the actual use cases.\n\nDeveloper needs a date formatting function. AI can generate it. But… so could a library. And the library version is tested. And documented. And handles edge cases. And gets security updates.\n\nWhat’s actually happening in practice? AI is finding and using existing utility libraries faster than humans would have. date-fns, lodash, NodaTime - these libraries aren’t declining, they’re exploding in adoption.5\n\nScenario 2: Custom Business Logic\n\nDeveloper needs a specific component for their application. AI generates it custom. Perfect! This is exactly what should be custom. This was never the domain of reusable open source anyway.\n\nScenario 3: Complex, Critical Systems\n\nDeveloper needs authentication, database access, distributed coordination, payment processing. AI could generate custom implementations. But would you ship them to production? Would you stake your business on AI-generated cryptography? On custom distributed consensus?\n\nOf course not. You use Postgres, Entity Framework, Akka.NET, OpenSSL - the proven solutions with years of production hardening.\n\nHere’s what the Tailwind situation actually tells us: AI is devastating businesses that sell what LLMs can generate.\n\nThe numbers tell the whole story:\n\nThe most successful year in the framework’s history coincided with the business collapse. This isn’t a contradiction - it’s the clearest illustration of what AI actually disrupts.\n\nTailwind’s commercial business is Tailwind Plus - premium UI components, templates, and blocks. The free documentation served as the primary sales funnel: developers would visit the docs to learn Tailwind, discover the premium components, and purchase them.\n\nAI broke this model in two devastating ways.\n\nFirst: The sales funnel dried up.\n\nRemember learning curve arbitrage? When developers use AI to generate Tailwind code, they don’t need to visit the documentation. Adam noted that docs traffic is down about 40% from early 2023 - despite Tailwind being more popular than ever. Fewer eyeballs on the docs means fewer people discovering the premium products exist.\n\nSecond: The product itself became AI-generatable.\n\nAI undercut Tailwind’s business model. Selling those components was about eliminating friction for users - buy a pre-made pricing table instead of building one yourself. But AI found an even cheaper way to eliminate that friction: generate the component on demand, for free.\n\nWhen a developer asks an AI for a “responsive pricing table with Tailwind,” the LLM isn’t going to say “log into your Tailwind Plus account and download the pricing component.” It’s going to generate one from scratch. That’s the shortest path.\n\nUI components and templates are exactly the kind of low-blast-radius output that AI handles well. If the generated component looks slightly different than a premium template, nobody cares. You tweak it and move on.\n\nTailwind’s business model put them directly in competition with their own framework’s AI-assisted usage. The better AI gets at generating Tailwind code, the less reason anyone has to buy pre-built components.\n\nThe framework thrives. The component business struggles. Same company, opposite trajectories - because one benefits from AI adoption and the other is displaced by it.\n\nAI isn’t killing open source. It’s creating the golden age of open source consumption.\n\nMore developers can adopt more libraries faster than ever before. The friction that kept people building custom solutions has evaporated. The learning curves that protected mediocre alternatives have disappeared.\n\nWhat we’re seeing is consolidation around quality, acceleration of adoption, and the destruction of business models that were built on selling what AI can now generate.\n\nTailwind CSS isn’t dying. Tailwind Plus might be dying - time will tell to see how they pivot. But the CSS framework itself is more popular than ever. The component products built on top of it? Those are being outcompeted by the LLMs recommending the framework.\n\nIf you’re an open source maintainer, this is your moment. If you’ve built something genuinely valuable - critical infrastructure with high blast radius, strong community, clear use cases - you’re about to see adoption curves that would have taken a decade compress into a few years.\n\nThe future of open source isn’t bleak. It’s brighter than it’s ever been. But the businesses built on top of them? That’s a different story - and it’s what we’ll dig into in Part 2.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a two-part series. Part 2 examines which open source business models thrive and which collapse in the AI era. The same AI wave that disrupted Tailwind’s business certainly didn’t hurt ours - our support subscriptions grew 19% in 2025, and AI-driven adoption likely contributed. Part 2 examines what makes some OSS business models resilient while others struggle. \n\nWhat’s your experience been? Are you seeing AI tools increase or decrease your open source usage? Hit me up on Twitter/X - I’m curious to hear how this is playing out across different ecosystems.\n\nGeoff wrote this all the way back in June 2025, well before this Tailwind situation.

    "description": "Sakana AI Agent Wins AtCoder Heuristic Contest (First AI to Place 1st)",
    "fullText": "Sakana AI’s “ALE-Agent” achieved a historic milestone by securing 1st place in the AtCoder Heuristic Contest 058, outperforming 804 human participants. To contextualize the difficulty of these optimization challenges, an OpenAI agent previously secured 2nd place in the AHC world tournament last August. This victory marks the first known instance of an AI agent winning a major optimization programming contest in real-time. The result demonstrates that by utilizing inference-time scaling with multiple frontier models, AI agents can now match or exceed the performance of top human experts in complex tasks requiring extended reasoning.\n\nDuring the 4-hour contest, our agent autonomously discovered a novel algorithm that outperformed the problem setters’ intended solution. While the problem setters’ anticipated a standard approach combining constructive heuristics and simulated annealing (SA), our ALE-Agent independently derived a “virtual power” heuristic and a sophisticated SA strategy with diverse neighborhood search operations, allowing it to escape local optima more effectively than human competitors.\n\nOperating at a total cost of approximately $1,300, the agent engaged in parallel code generation and iterative analysis, proving that AI is now capable of the original scientific discovery and trial-and-error required for high-level problem solving.\n\nFor the detailed information, including the logs and analysis output by ALE-Agent during the contest, see: https://sakanaai.github.io/fishylene-ahc058/ and our earlier NeurIPS’25 paper.\n\nThe AtCoder Heuristic Contest (AHC) is a series of programming competitions focused on optimization problems related to real-world industrial challenges, such as logistics optimization and factory production scheduling. These contests are characterized by approximately 1,000 programmers including experts active in various industrial sectors. Participants tackle a single, complex coding challenge, with contest durations ranging from four hours to two weeks.\n\nAHC has garnered significant global attention. In August 2025, a world championship featuring top-tier players was held, where an AI agent from OpenAI participated and won 2nd place. Sakana AI has also co-developed ALE-Bench, a benchmark platform based on AHC, in collaboration with AtCoder Inc. Furthermore, under special permission, our AI agent called ALE-Agent has been continuously participating in AHCs in real-time.\n\nAHC058, held on December 14, 2025, was conducted over a 4-hour competition window. The problem involved a setting where participants could produce machines with hierarchical relationships, such as multiple types of “apple-producing machines” and “machines that build those machines.” The objective was to construct an efficient production planning algorithm by determining which types and hierarchies of machines to upgrade and in what specific order.\n\nWhile the setting may seem humorous at first glance, these hierarchical production dependencies mirror real-world supply chains, food webs, and manufacturing processes, making it a scientifically interesting problem setup. For further details on the problem, please refer to the contest’s problem statement.\n\nALE-Agent began making submissions two hours after the contest started and immediately leapt to 1st place in the provisional standings.\n\nIn the middle of the contest, ALE-Agent was in a fierce dead heat with yosupo, the eventual 2nd-place finisher. ALE-Agent regained 1st place approximately two and a half hours into the contest and maintained the lead until the end to secure the victory.\n\nIn AHC058, the solution expected by the problem author was an approach that used algorithms like Greedy methods or Beam Search to determine a global strategic plan, followed by Simulated Annealing (SA) to refine the plan’s finer details.\n\nALE-Agent’s answer followed the same basic flow as a human: “construction by Greedy → refinement by SA.” However, it was a quintessential “AI-style” solution that maximized the AI’s strengths: numerous implementations and exhaustive trial and error. Analysis of the final program revealed the following characteristics:\n\nAnalyzing the process through which ALE-Agent generated its response revealed that it implemented the solution while deepening its understanding of the problem’s characteristics. (Logs can be viewed on this page).\n\nThe latest version of ALE-Agent is equipped with a mechanism to repeat trial and error by generating multiple programs simultaneously, summarizing those results to generate insights, and utilizing them for subsequent code generation. Looking at the insights generated by ALE-Agent, we can see it examining the problem based on experience; it mentioned the compound interest effect in connection with investment knowledge, devised high-speed algorithms using mathematics from an early stage, and discussed the nature of the search space, noting that initial strategies cause significant differences.\n\nWe received comments regarding ALE-Agent’s performance and approach from two experts familiar with the optimization field and AHC.\n\nFrom Hiroomi Nochide (AtCoder handle: itigo):\n\nActually, before the contest started, I thought this problem would be difficult for LLMs. This is because solving this problem with a Greedy method requires experimental insight that LLMs typically struggle with, and I thought a high score would be impossible without this human-centric consideration. However, when the results came out, I was stunned to see fishylene win.\n\nChecking the logs, it tried a vast number of patterns with promising directions and discovered a clever simulated annealing method that was not anticipated at the time the problem was created. I am impressed, thinking, ‘How did it find such a method?’ (In the logs, the parts requiring the experimental insight I initially expected did not appear, and given that humans still excelled in the Greedy portion, I believe human accuracy in consideration is still superior. However,) the overwhelming number of trial-and-error steps combined with LLM reasoning is an advantage humans do not have. While I feel fishylene is a formidable rival, I believe this technology will be a tremendous weapon for humanity.\n\n(Note: fishylene is ALE-Agent’s AtCoder account name)\n\nHiroomi Nochide authored the problem for AHC058. He is one of the world’s top players (24th in AHC world rankings) and a professional in this field at ALGO ARTIS CORPORATION.\n\nFrom Yoichi Iwata (AtCoder handle: wata):\n\nThis problem required optimizing investment plans for multiple series of production machines, where the high-level choice of which series to select as ‘final investment targets’ and ‘intermediate investment targets’ was essentially the core issue. With simple local improvement methods that only slightly change the investment target at each turn, it is difficult to switch this global strategy midway, often leading to poor local optima.\n\nThe expected solution from the author’s side was a two-stage approach: first explore a wide range of global investment plan candidates using a lightweight solver, and then spend time optimizing the promising ones. In contrast, the solutions from ALE-Agent and the runner-up, yosupo, were based on local search but introduced ‘Large Neighborhoods’ that change a huge portion of the investment plan at once to escape local optima. In particular, ALE-Agent utilized a diversified Greedy method to reconstruct large parts of the plan, which seems to have led to its performance advantage.\n\nHistorically, ALE-Agent has tended to choose solutions within the author’s expected range, yet its high implementation and optimization power allowed it to reach the top ranks among many participants using similar methods, especially in short-duration contests. This time, it was very impressive to see it go one step further and reach a solution that exceeded the author’s expectations.\n\nYoichi Iwata oversees AHC at AtCoder. He has an outstanding track record in this field, including winning the 2010 TopCoder Open. His scores in pre-contest test plays sometimes exceed the top participant scores, and he ensures the high quality of AHC problems.\n\nALE-Agent is an agent that performs algorithm discovery by utilizing multiple LLMs to create solutions in parallel, selecting the best ones, and reasoning further based on the results of trial and error. As such, it requires a high volume of LLM calls. The resources utilized during the 4-hour contest were as follows:\n\nThis result is significant as it demonstrates that even for multi-hour tasks, by scaling inference costs and running a properly designed AI agent, AI can reach or surpass the performance of top human experts.\n\nIdentifying which specific elements of ALE-Agent’s design contributed most to this dramatic result remains an important research task for the future. Our current analysis suggests that in addition to scaling LLM calls and injecting domain knowledge, a “self-learning mechanism,” which extracts insights from trial-and-error trajectory and reflects them in the next improvement cycle, played an important role.\n\nAs highlighted in evaluation reports such as those from METR (Model Evaluation and Threat Research), the latest AI models are beginning to show high proficiency in tasks requiring several hours of human effort. Our result follows this trend but is unique in showing that an AI agent with appropriate mechanisms and inference scaling can rival top human experts.\n\nHowever, at this point, AI does not always rival or surpass top humans. The table below shows ALE-Agent’s past performance. While ALE-Agent has often ranked highly in previous AHCs, AHC058 marks its first victory. Additionally, its calculated virtual rating is 2592, which corresponds to 66th place among active users.\n\nAVisualization of ALE-Agent’s past AHC performance and Rating. The graph shows the contribution of performance values from each contest to the overall rating. https://atcoder-graphs.vercel.app/#contributorGraph\n\nLooking ahead, we aim to increase stability to ensure consistently high performance across similar tasks and to evolve our agents to rival top experts in longer-term tasks lasting several days or more. To achieve this, we will focus on balancing efficient human-like thinking with trial and error (moving away from purely heavy LLM call reliance) and acquiring more advanced autonomous management capabilities.\n\nIn real-world problem-solving, the process where humans interpret, generalize, and refine the unexpected discoveries presented by AI is highly effective. As noted in our report on the ICFP Programming Contest 2025, Sakana AI positions AI not as a replacement for humans, but as a partner that expands human exploration capabilities. Measuring achievements by AI alone, as we did here, is vital for understanding the current strengths and weaknesses of AI as a partner, and we believe this result represents a significant milestone in that journey.\n\nFinally, we would like to express our deep gratitude to AtCoder Inc. for their continuous cooperation and to ALGO ARTIS CORPORATION for hosting this contest.\n\nSakana AI will continue to explore new possibilities for intelligence and the practical application of AI agents in the real world.\n\nSakana AI is looking for experienced software engineers to lead the productization of platforms that solve complex real-world problems and accelerate AI-driven discovery, including projects like ALE-Agent. We are also looking for interns interested in the further development and industrial application of AI agents. Join our team and help us turn cutting-edge AI agent technology into practical value.\n\nDetails and Application: https://sakana.ai/careers/",

    "fullText": "In most healthcare organizations, AI adoption didn't begin with a strategy document or a formal approval process.\n\nIt began organically with individuals hearing about how AI could help them do their jobs better, easier. Who doesn't want that? So, they start using AI tools to summarize notes, draft communications, interpret documents, or explore ideas faster. Often with good intentions. Often without visibility.\n\nWhether an organization has formally approved AI usage or not, the reality is the same: AI is already in the workflow.\n\nThe real question is no longer if employees are using AI.\n\nIt's whether that usage is intentional, governed, and defensible.\n\nMany organizations respond to AI risk in one of two ways:\n\nNeither approach reflects how work actually gets done.\n\nWhen tools are banned outright, usage tends to move underground.\n\nWhen policies exist without enforcement or structure, teams are left guessing where the boundaries really are.\n\nIn both cases, leadership loses visibility causing compliance risk to go up.\n\nThe most common AI risk in healthcare isn't malicious behavior or reckless intent.\n\nIt's the absence of a clear boundary between sensitive work and external AI systems.\n\nIn regulated environments, invisible usage is often riskier than visible, governed usage.\n\nA compliance gateway is not about surveillance.\n\nIt's not about monitoring individuals or second-guessing intent.\n\nA compliance gateway is an organizational control layer that sits between employees and AI systems, making AI usage:\n\nInstead of relying solely on policy documents or trust, organizations provide a clear, approved path for AI usage that aligns with regulatory obligations.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths about AI governance is that it slows teams down.\n\nThey spend less time guessing, self-censoring, or avoiding AI altogether.\n\nGovernance, when done well, becomes an enabler.\n\nHealthcare compliance is rarely about eliminating risk entirely.\n\nIt's about managing risk intentionally.\n\nOrganizations that struggle most with AI compliance are often not the ones using AI aggressively. They're the ones who can't see how it's being used at all.\n\nVisibility enables informed decision making, targeted controls, and credible explanations when questions arise.\n\nWithout visibility, even well-meaning organizations are forced to rely on hope.\n\nAs AI becomes embedded in everyday healthcare workflows, governance will increasingly shift:\n\nThe organizations that adapt successfully won't be the ones that stopped AI usage.\n\nThey'll be the ones that made it explicit, governed, and defensible.\n\nEmployees are already bringing AI into healthcare work because the incentives are real and the productivity gains are tangible.\n\nThe choice facing organizations isn't whether to allow AI.\n\nIt's whether AI usage will happen outside of governance or within it.\n\nGuardian Health is being built as a governed AI workbench for healthcare teams: designed to sit between employees and AI systems, making data handling decisions explicit, auditable, and defensible. Our focus is less on controlling behavior, and more on providing clear, compliant pathways for real-world AI usage.",

    "description": "The company's CEO said the ordeal has “been a difficult chapter.”",
    "fullText": "A well-known coffee brand has filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAs it turns out, its Compass Coffee.\n\nThe 25-unit chain based in the DMW market filed on Tuesday, and it’s all because of a lasting, “massive” impact leftover from the pandemic.\n\nWith a plan in place, the company intends to sell itself to “a strategic buyer with a substantial, global presence in the retail coffee business.”\n\nPlanning to file an asset purchase agreement, it will designate the buyer as the stalking horse bidder, which means the buyer sets the baseline that other bidders must beat, according to QSR.\n\nCompass will refuse the leases of 10 locations that aren’t producing profit, including its former headquarters and roastery, which is part of the bankruptcy.\n\nThe entirety of brand’s locations are based in Washington, D.C., Southern Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nCurrently, the company owes $11.7 million and has found itself sued by a number of landlords and venders over past due rent or other payments.\n\nComing to the aid of Compass is one of its investors – National Investment Group – which has committed to providing up to $450,000 in debtor-in-possession financing to help Compass fund bankruptcy restructuring costs and power through the sales process.\n\nBut the funds can’t be finalized until a judge signs off on it.\n\nAccording to what CEO and cofounder Michael Haft admitted in a LinkedIn post, the entire ordeal has “been a difficult chapter.”\n\n“The decisions we’re making reflect the reality of this moment in Washington and are about ensuring Compass can continue serving the city with the same real good coffee and sense of community that have defined us from the beginning.”\n\nIn court documents, Haft noted that the brand witnessed the “loss of considerable revenue” amid the pandemic as it was forced to downsize its workforce.\n\nCompass attempted to offset the loss of income by developing an in-house roastery and distribution business.\n\nBut things haven’t returned back to how it was before the pandemic due to fewer government employees and an increase of remote work in the area.\n\nThough some locations have stayed profitable, others are either “minimally profitable” or unprofitable. In order to slash costs, Compass came out of its coffee distribution business to focus on the main business of café’s.\n\n“Downtown was busy, people gathered in offices and cafés every day, and Compass grew alongside the city,” Haft said in his LinkedIn post.\n\n“That rhythm has changed in lasting ways since 2020. Foot traffic downtown has not returned, work patterns are different, and the economics of running urban cafés look very different than they did even a few years ago. Like many local restaurants and cafés, we reached a moment where we had to confront that reality honestly,” the post stated.",

    "title": "Despite getting flak for being woke and lazy, an exec at $62 billion giant Colgate says Gen Z workers are actually ‘pushing us to get better’",
    "description": "Sally Massey, the chief human resources officer at the $62 billion giant Colgate-Palmolive, is hitting back that young staffers aren’t the career sloths some typecast them to be.",
    "fullText": "Stereotypes stick, and some bosses have already made up their minds on Gen Z workers. Oscar-winning star Jodie Foster slammed the young staffers she encountered on the set of True Detective as “really annoying, especially in the workplace,” while fellow actress Whoopi Goldberg claimed that Gen Zers “only want to work four hours” yet expect to live in comfort.\n\nBut the chief human resources officer at $62 billion giant Colgate-Palmolive is hitting back that young staffers aren’t the career sloths some typecast them to be. Sally Massey credits Gen Z as being ambitious, and incredibly tech savvy—critical skills that the consumer products company behind Colgate toothpaste and Irish Spring soap is looking for in talent.\n\n“[Gen Z] have grown up with technology. They’ve grown up in a very different way than some of the other generations in the organization,” the CHRO tells Fortune.\n\n“They bring with them new ideas, new perspectives, curiosity,” Massey adds. “They’re pushing us to get better and to do things differently—I think it’s great.”\n\nMassey admits that Gen Z are bringing their own distinct “perspectives and expectations” to the workplace. And with 34,000 Colgate employees spread out among four generations, bridging the divide between age groups is especially daunting. So to ensure that everyone is working in harmony, the exec is revamping the usual chain of command; Colgate’s top leaders are hearing out entry-level staffers, stimulating the flow of ideas between ranks and generations to generate the best possible outcome.\n\n“We’re not siloed by generation or tenure, the senior leaders at Colgate want to hear ideas and thoughts from the more junior employees,” Massey says. “It’s how we get better, because as you get more senior, you can get further away. So it’s important for all of us to stay close, connected, and to learn from each other—regardless of the role.”\n\nMassey’s not alone. Not all employers have given up on hiring Gen Zers—despite headlines that suggest otherwise. In fact, many are still scoping out young talent with standout AI skills.\n\nEmily Glassberg Sands, Stripe’s head of data and AI, revealed she’s all-in on hiring recent graduates at the $91.5 billion financial services company. Just like Massey, she singled out Gen Z’s tech adaptability as one of the in-demand skills she’s looking for in Stripe employees.\n\n“I’m actually hiring more new grads—now, they’re largely new grad PhDs—but more new grads than ever before,” Glassberg Sands said on the Forward Future podcast last year. “Because they have the cutting edge skills, and they come in with fresh ideas, and they know how to think, and they know how to use the latest tools.”\n\nEven when young employees drive their bosses up the wall, CEOs are still embracing Gen Z as movers and shakers. Matt Huang, the cofounder of the $12 billion crypto investment firm Paradigm, is all too familiar with the temperament of young workers. The company’s first hire, then-19-year-old college dropout Charlie Noyes, once showed up five hours late to his first 10 a.m. meeting. The business has also embraced Gen Z-coded, unorthodox ways of choosing its top executives; Paradigm’s chief technology officer, Georgios Konstantopoulos, was discovered on a Discord server while he was still a teenager.\n\nHiring these innovative—albeit, sometimes finicky—Gen Zers may sound like a gamble for traditional workplaces. The Paradigm CEO admitted that the young staffers can come with drawbacks, but the value they generate is worth any havoc they wreak in the office.\n\n“They create an absurd amount of chaos sometimes and you want to pull your hair out,” Huang told Colossus Review last year. “But then you see what they can do and it’s like, holy crap. Nobody else in the world could do that.”\n\nEven the seasoned business experts teaching legions of Gen Z students are cutting in on criticism. Suzy Welch, a best-selling author and professor of management practice at New York University, hit back against those who brand the young generation lazy by reminiscing on her career journey. The baby boomer professor recalled having hope that she could one day be more successful than her parents—but for Gen Zers, that dream of prosperity is out of reach. Welch encouraged bosses to empathize with their unique job and economic vulnerabilities.\n\n“Gen Z [has] no reason to believe that they’re ever going to have economic security,” Welch said on a podcast last year. “I don’t know about you, but I’m old enough that when I was in college, I thought ‘For sure, I’m going to have more money than my parents.’ And that ‘If I work very very hard I’m going to buy a house someday,’ and this was the assumption.”\n\n“A lot of Gen Z [are] just saying ‘I’m not even sure we’re going to be alive in 20 years because of global warming,’” Welch continued. “And ‘The world is probably going to end anyway because of the stupidity of decisions your generations made.’”\n\nMillionaire podcaster and former CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins also came to Gen Z’s defense. In response to stereotypes that young people are anxious, addicted to social media, and lazy, she posed one question: “Have you stopped to consider what it’s like to be a twentysomething today?” Chances are if critics try and envision stepping into their shoes, they’ll be met with the harsh reality that Gen Zers are under immense stress and pressure that didn’t exist just five years ago.\n\n“The world is in chaos—and most twentysomethings had parents that lived in a very predictable, stable economy,” Robbins said in a TikTok video posted last year. “They went to a corporate job, they reported to the office, they had a network of friends at work. That’s not the typical 20-year-old experience.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "CNN’s Michael Smerconish couldn’t believe his eyes when reading a fan tweet live on air Saturday.\n\n“From [Rhode Island],” Smerconish began reading. “You are making it way too complicated. The rule should be, if you run from the police — What? Are you s***ting me?”\n\nHe continued, “If you run from the police, you’ll be shot. That should be the standard? Surely — Put that camera on me!”\n\nSmerconish repeated the tweet again.\n\n“Surely, you jest. Surely you — ‘If you run from the police, you’ll be shot,'” he said. “That’s the world in which you want to live?”\n\nSmerconish continued, “By the way, I’m a shoplifter. I’m a — I don’t know — a car thief, I’m a pickpocket artist, and the police happen upon the scene, and I run. And you want me shot without regard for any standard as to serious bodily harm or death being in play? No, that’s…there is a country for you and it’s behind an iron curtain. It’s probably a place where they would chop off your hand as well. That is nutty.”\n\nVice President JD Vance claimed on Thursday that the federal agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis mother Renee Good, was protected by “absolutely immunity.”\n\n“You have a federal law enforcement official engaging in federal law enforcement action — that’s a federal issue,” Vance said. “He is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job.”\n\nFederal agents do not, in fact, have absolute immunity. They have what’s called “Supremacy Clause immunity” that protects them from state criminal prosecution when they’re carrying out their official duties, provided their actions are “necessary and proper.”\n\nIt would be up to a court to determine whether ICE agent Jonathan Good’s actions met this standard when he shot Good multiple as she moved her vehicle after being instructed to exit.  Good’s last words to the agent were, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you.”\n\nA male voice can be heard on the scene calling her a “f**king bitch after shots were fired,” according to footage released to the public.\n\nThe Trump administration claimed that Good engaged in an act of “domestic terrorism” and hit Ross with her van.\n\nThe post ‘Are You Sh**ting Me?’ Smerconish Stunned By Viewer Saying ‘If You Run From The Police’ You’ll Be Shot first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nBurmese pythons achieved the near-total disappearance of 3 native species in the Florida Everglades.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons in the area.\n\n2005 field data counterintuitively confirm that a Burmese python can consume an entire American alligator.\n\nPythons utilize nest-raiding to win the battle before crocodiles ever reach the showdown.\n\nWho do you think would win a fight between a python and a crocodile in Florida?\n\nGenerally, we would look to real-life examples for clues, but surprisingly, there isn’t very much of that. While there are a few examples of pythons getting into it with alligators in Florida, they don’t seem to have many significant interactions with crocodiles.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we can’t wager a pretty good guess on our own, though. We can actually take a look at pythons and crocodiles in Florida and see who would emerge victorious in an encounter between them.\n\nThe Burmese python is not a native species in Florida. However, they are often found around the Everglades in South Florida. Native to Southeast Asia, Burmese pythons were first brought to the United States as exotic pets. Some pet owners ended up releasing the snakes into the wild, and the problem began.\n\nThe Burmese python is now considered to be a nuisance to the Everglades ecosystem, and for good reason. These pythons compete with native animals for food. They have also caused severe declines in many native species, including bobcats, opossums, and raccoons.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons.\n\nIn fact, they’ve even been known to eat alligators in some cases. In 2005, in the Florida Everglades, the body of a Burmese python was found with an American alligator in its stomach!\n\nThe American crocodile, or Crocodylus acutus, generally populate South Florida. This is the northern end of the crocodile’s range in most cases. They can be found in coves, ponds, and creeks in mangrove swamps, and they typically inhabit saltwater or brackish areas.\n\nFloridians will often see crocodiles basking in the sun. Because they’re ectothermic animals, they rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures.\n\nThey are the largest reptiles on earth and are said to be able to produce tears. They can’t chew their food, and to improve digestion, they have been known to swallow rocks. Crocodiles also have special hearts. Their hearts have four chambers just like humans do!\n\nShy and reclusive, they’re generally not a danger to people. If they’re approached by a person while basking in the sun, they’ll usually just quickly escape into the water.\n\nAmerican crocodiles typically eat small mammals, frogs, fish, turtles, and birds. Humans are the main threats to crocodiles because of habitat destruction and illegal hunting.\n\nCrocodile nests are also in danger due to predators, such as birds, crabs, and raccoons. In some cases, pythons will even eat alligator and crocodile eggs.\n\nPythons live in tropical areas of Asia and Africa. They can thrive in either wet or dry environments; however, they are freshwater and fully marine. They like it where it is hot and wet so their bodies can stay warm. They are usually found in rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, swamps, and shrubs.\n\nThese types of environments are home to many different creatures, such as the crocodile. That’s why these creatures are natural enemies because they share the same waters and wetlands.\n\nIf a Ball Python are able to survive adulthood, they can live about 10 to 15 years in the wild. However, the expected lifespan for a ball python living in captivity is around 30 years. Some, however, have been recorded to live over 50 years old when cared for properly.\n\nWhen predicting who would win in a battle between a python and a crocodile, we need to consider all of the factors. Knowledge of the physical features of both of these animals is very helpful in this process.\n\nPythons are often longer than crocodiles, reaching up to 26 feet long, while crocodiles usually aren’t more than 20 feet long. However, crocodiles do have the size advantage, as they tend to be much heavier. While a python is typically no more than about 200 pounds, a crocodile can be up to 2,000 pounds.\n\nCrocodiles have the size advantage over pythons.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles have the ability to stay submerged under water for stretches of time. However, crocodiles are much faster, being able to run up to about 25 miles per hour in some cases. Pythons only slither at about one mile per hour. Even if crocodiles can only run for short distances, they can easily catch up to a python in most cases.\n\nCrocodiles have the speed advantage over pythons.\n\nPythons do have the ability to use heat sensors and chemical receptors to stalk their prey. However, they typically have poor eyesight. Crocodiles have better eyesight and are able to see in the dark. They have strong senses of hearing and smell, as well as the ability to sense even subtle changes in pressure.\n\nCrocodiles have keener senses than pythons.\n\nPythons and crocodiles are both relatively large animals, although crocodiles are significantly larger. Pythons can camouflage themselves fairly effectively. Pythons and crocodiles both have the ability to submerge themselves underwater.\n\nIn terms of physical defenses, it’s a tie between pythons and crocodiles.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles are known for surprise attacks. Pythons have sharp teeth and the ability to constrict their prey with their bodies. Their bite is painful, but they’re not venomous, and it is not a strong enough bite to be fatal in most cases. Crocodiles, on the other hand, have the strongest bite ever seen in a living animal.\n\nGiven the vital stats of both competitors in this fight, we’d have to say that in an encounter between a python and a crocodile in Florida, the crocodile would probably be the winner.\n\nOf course, pythons are not completely powerless. If they’re able to get past a crocodile mother and eat crocodile eggs, they can prevent crocodiles from even getting to the fight in the first place.\n\nPythons can clearly hold their own, which is why they are so successful as an invasive species in Florida. But given the size and strength of the crocodile, it would likely be no contest between the two. Perhaps at some point, we’ll see evidence of crocodiles helping to control this invasive species.\n\nThe simple answer here is yes. The python lives in an aquatic type habitat and while swimming it is vulnerable to attack. This means that if a python is in the water, it is within perfect striking conditions for crocodiles. While younger snakes can be captured and eaten more easily by a crocodile of any size. The older python the larger it gets, so depending on the age of the snake the crocodile may not attack.\n\nThe post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "description": "The NFL Playoffs begin with six Wild Card games. We'll show you how to live stream every match-up online.",
    "fullText": "The NFL playoffs have arrived, and 12 teams will duke it out in Wild Card games for a shot at the Divisional round. We've gathered everything you need to know about where to watch NFL Wild Card games, including live streaming options.\n\nThe Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks earned first-round byes, but the other 12 teams to make it to the postseason will battle it out in one of six Wild Card games. The NFC will see Los Angeles Rams vs. Carolina Panthers, Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears, and San Francisco 49ers vs. Philadelphia Eagles showdowns. The AFC will feature Buffalo Bills vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Chargers vs. New England Patriots, and Houston Texans vs. Pittsburgh Steelers games.\n\nThe most notable omission in this year's postseason lineup is the Kansas City Chiefs, who haven't missed the playoffs in several years and made it all the way to the Super Bowl for five out of the six past seasons. The Chiefs faced a tricky couple of months and ultimately lost their star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, to a season-ending knee injury in mid-December.\n\nWhether the Eagles, the reigning champions, can go all the way again this year or whether there will be two fresh teams at Super Bowl LX remains to be seen. Keep reading to learn some of the best ways to tune into the Wild Card round, including global streaming options.\n\nThe NFL Wild Card games are spread across several networks and streaming services in the US, including Prime Video, CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN. Each network has its own streaming counterpart, which we'll dig into below, but if you're looking to watch every game (other than the streaming exclusive Prime Video match-up) in one place, then a live TV streaming service will be able to help you out.\n\nThe best live TV streaming service we've tested that carries CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN, in addition to other networks, is DirecTV. These channels are available in any of the streamer's Signature packages, but you can also find them in the DirecTV MySports genre pack. MySports carries around 20 popular sports channels and unlocks access to ESPN Unlimited. Local channels in genre packs sometimes vary by region, so it's a good idea to see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. MySports subscriptions cost $70 a month, while Signature plans start at $90 a month. DirecTV offers a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nDirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network.\n\nAs we mentioned above, the Packers vs. Bears game will be exclusive to Prime Video.

    "fullText": "California has a lot of billionaires, more than any other state and more than most countries. So a proposed wealth tax on its billionaires could be a windfall, if they stick around.\n\nUnder the Billionaire Tax Act, California residents worth over $1 billion would face a one-time tax totaling 5% of their assets.\n\nIf the tax plan receives enough signatures, it will appear on the ballot in November and, if passed, would apply retroactively to billionaires living in the state as of January 1. The tax would be due in 2027, with the option to spread the payment out over five years, with interest.\n\nThe idea has drawn sharp reactions from lawmakers and business leaders.\n\nGoogle cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved entities tied to them out of the state last month just ahead of the deadline, Business Insider first reported.\n\nNvidia CEO and billionaire Jensen Huang said he was \"perfectly fine\" with the tax. Palmer Luckey, the billionaire founder of defense tech startup Anduril, said it would force companies to \"immediately pivot into profit obsession over mission or long-term sustainability.\"\n\nCritics of the tax have warned it will encourage ultrawealthy residents to flee the state and hurt California's economy.\n\nAs of January 1, there were 214 billionaires in California, according to Forbes data compiled by Americans for Tax Fairness, a group that advocates for higher taxes.\n\nBelow is the full list of billionaires in California.

    "description": "I sent my husband and kids to visit family and spent the holidays alone, discovering how restorative intentional solitude can be.",
    "fullText": "When people asked me what I was doing for the holidays, I responded almost too giddily, \"I'm spending it alone.\" Their eyes narrowed, \"What?\"\n\nI told them I was sending my husband and the kids to his family in Massachusetts, and I'd stay back in Pennsylvania. All. By. Myself. I wouldn't have to answer to anyone or for anything. Not requests for snacks or one more backrub. I wouldn't have to sit rigid, wondering if one of my three kids was creeping out of a bed that wasn't theirs. Or defend my parenting style while my oldest yelled about how life wasn't fair and we must all really hate him, and why should he have to listen to anyone anyway.\n\nAfter a beat, every single mom (and a few dads) told me: \"I'm jealous. I want to do that. How did you swing that?\"\n\nThe decision to be alone during the holidays came slowly at first and then all at once. I'd hit a breaking point that most parents, especially moms, are all too familiar with. But the moment I toyed with the idea of staying back — in a quiet, clean, empty house — that was it. It was all I could think about.\n\nI broached the topic, gently, with my husband, who couldn't have been more supportive and emphatic. \"You should take a few days away!\" But I didn't want to be away. I wanted to be home alone. That was the key.\n\nAs the days ticked closer to The Big Departure, people asked me when Jeff and the kids were leaving. \"Wednesday, but I can't ask when, specifically,\" I'd laugh.\n\nI explained to the kids that I needed some alone time; I needed to take a break. They, who are 8, 5, and 3, were relatively unfazed. My middle, big-feeling daughter made me promise to call her every two minutes. I wanted them to know that it was OK for Mom (or Dad) to step away and be alone. It didn't mean I loved them any less. Something, something about distance making the heart grow fonder.\n\nMental health experts agree. Solitude can be a crucial form of self-care (unless it makes you truly uncomfortable to be totally alone). \"When you seek out intentional solitude, and the demands on your attention and focus melt away, it allows you to have a level of awareness that can support healing and growth,\" Emily Moriarty, M.Ed., a licensed professional counselor and director of clinical services at Reset Outdoors, told Business Insider.\n\nFinally, they were off. And I didn't know what to do with myself. Everything was weirdly quiet. Clean. Empty. I loved it. I had a couple of low-key plans over the next few days, but my goal was to savor the silence and the lack of a schedule.\n\nWhen 5 p.m. rolled around on the first night, I started making dinner while listening to music. I danced a little. I ate while reading a book. No one argued with me that they didn't like what was served. Cleanup was easy. I put my dishes away. I didn't need to sweep — I don't spill things on the floor.\n\nI turned my phone off; I didn't need an alarm. No one needed to reach me, and if they did, they could wait. Dad was more than capable. I slept in. I drank coffee on the couch in front of the fire in my pajamas. I forced myself to allow things to move slowly — something I have a hard time doing with or without kids.\n\n\"Solitude doesn't include sitting alone in an office working,\" Moriarty said. \"It has to be non-work, non-caregiving time.\"\n\nWhen it was time for the Big Holiday Meal, I thought I'd feel a little lonely. But I didn't, and that, I realized, was because this was my choice. I knew my family was enjoying themselves with relatives they don't often see and having a little vacation. And I knew that they'd all be home before I knew it.\n\nI'm sure that has more to do with the stark contrast of raising three kids, co-running a household, and having a (fairly successful) career, and four days of abrupt, near-total solitude. If I didn't have kids at all, I'm sure I wouldn't be bored at 7 p.m.\n\nPeople have since asked me if this will be my new holiday tradition. I did like it, maybe a bit too much, but it feels wrong to indefinitely celebrate the holidays without my kith and kin. Four days weren't enough to assuage Mom Guilt, apparently.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s southern Volgograd region, officials said Saturday, after Russia launched a powerful hypersonic missile along with drones and other weapons that disrupted Kyiv's power supply and heating.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties, Volgograd Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said Saturday it had struck the Zhutovskaya oil depot overnight. In a statement on Telegram, it said the depot is supplying fuel to Russian forces, adding that damage was being assessed.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nSaturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nStéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Friday's attacks “have resulted in significant civilian casualties and deprived millions of Ukrainians of essential services, including electricity, heating and water at a time of acute humanitarian need.”\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said heat supply would be fully restored in Kyiv by the end of Saturday.\n\nShe said areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River would gradually lift emergency blackouts and return to scheduled outages. But resuming power supply on the left bank, where Russian attacks were concentrated, is more complicated due to significant damage to the power grid, she added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down.\n\nSeparately, the Russian Defense Ministry said 59 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight over Russia and occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's military said that besides the oil depot in Volgograd, it had struck a drone storage facility belonging to a unit of Russia’s 19th Motor Rifle Division in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, as well as a drone command and control point near the eastern city of Pokrovsk.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "The commander summarized a recent, intense period of operations in an area where the proximity of Palestinian villages to Israeli communities complicates the challenges faced by the IDF.\n\nThe commander of the IDF’s Battalion 101 in the Paratroopers Brigade revealed the complexity involved in West Bank operations during an interview with Walla published on Friday.\n\nThe commander, referred to as Lt.-Col. R. summarized a recent, intense period of operations in an area where the proximity of Palestinian villages to Israeli communities is completely different from that faced by soldiers in Gaza or Lebanon.\n\nWhen asked what the greatest challenge for him in the sector was, he replied that “in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon, the sector boundaries are clear.”\n\n“You know what your vital assets are, you know what you need to defend, you know where the enemy is, and you know where you are,” he continued. “In the West Bank, how do you protect so many communities across such a large area?”\n\nHe added that as a battalion commander, he was responsible for a large sector of territory spanning 20 kilometers by 20 kilometers. “The nearest company commander from the battalion headquarters is 40 minutes away,” he said. “In Gaza, if your subordinate encounters terrorists, you’re with him within a minute. I was in many situations, and in the West Bank, it’s different. You have to protect many vital assets.”\n\nAccording to Lt.-Col. R., “it’s a challenge no less complex than attacking deep inside Lebanon.”\n\n“So how do you protect so many vital assets across such a large area? You need every force with you to conduct itself at the level of a battalion commander in the field. You have no other option - you must trust it. Think about the fact that even for a company commander, it can take 15 minutes to reach an incident in his sector.”\n\nOver the past two months, the battalion carried out four operations, during which two terrorists were killed, and 26 suspects involved in terrorist activity were arrested.\n\nIn addition, the battalion recently conducted an operation in which 40 wanted individuals were arrested overnight.\n\nIn another operation in the village of Kafr Aqab, Lt. Col. R. recounted that “an entire battalion walked four kilometers through the village. That demonstrated governance. It sent the message.”\n\nLt. Col. R. described another incident in which a terrorist attempted to carry out an attack in the settlement of Ateret. “The fighters were right near the entrance to the community. A patrol that rushed there within three minutes encountered the terrorist and killed him. Another terrorist tried to move up toward the farm - and he too was killed.”\n\nWhen asked how the West Bank sector looks now compared to past situations, and whether it is more or less volatile, Lt. Col. R. said that it is “not the West Bank [he] knew from the past.”\n\nElaborating on the changing atmosphere, he said that “entering the refugee camps of Balata, Askar, and Jenin today is not the same as it used to be. In the past, we would enter with large forces, and today, a force under the command of a squad leader or a platoon commander carries out arrests in the casbah of Nablus,” asserting that “today, the IDF has freedom of action.”",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMost lottery winners make a beeline for luxury real estate, buying up seven-bedroom mansions with koi ponds, glass walls, and garages that look like car museums. But one lucky Virginian with $155.6 million in their pocket decided to celebrate differently—with a lawn mower. Not just any lawn mower, either. A zero-turn riding mower. Call it humble. Call it hilarious. Either way, it's a far cry from the Hollywood Hills.\n\nThe anonymous winner of Virginia's largest-ever jackpot—a $348 million Mega Millions haul—walked into the state lottery office, cashed out with the lump sum, and made one wish known: they planned to mow their lawn in style. That's not exactly the plotline My Lottery Dream Home was built around. In fact, the entire HGTV show banks on winners going house-hunting for multimillion-dollar properties—mountaintop estates in Colorado, beachfront retreats in Florida, or swanky Texas compounds. Not pushin' a mower down the driveway.\n\nFor context, Edwin Castro, who won a record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot in California in 2022, spent a chunk of his cash on three mansions: a $25.5 million glass-box home in Hollywood Hills, a $4 million Zen-inspired retreat in Altadena, and a $47 million Bel Air estate complete with koi pond, naturally. That was all before he started stockpiling vintage Porsches. He may never touch a weed-whacker again.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' just opened a $0.85/share round — 10,000+ investors are already in.\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nBut this Virginia winner? They're bucking the cliché. And ironically, that low-key decision might be a smarter financial move than buying a $40 million mega-mansion with upkeep costs that chew through millions annually. Real estate is still a top-tier wealth-building tool—but owning it and living in it are two very different games.\n\nBut here's the twist: skipping the mansion might actually be the more financially sound move.\n\nHomeownership remains one of the most powerful ways to build wealth. According to the Federal Reserve's latest data, the median homeowner has 43 times more net worth than the median renter. That wealth gap isn't just about property value—it's also about stability, appreciation, and the ability to leverage equity.\n\nUnfortunately, homeownership has become a high-barrier dream for many. Mortgage rates are high, starter homes are scarce, and even modest properties come with hefty down payments, bidding wars, and monthly payments that rival luxury rents.",

About 40 minutes after that check, friends of the Tepes found them dead in their home.\n\nPolice have focused the investigation on the window of time between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on Dec. 30, which is when they believe the couple was killed. On Jan. 5, detectives released video from a security camera showing a person walking in an alley near the Tepes' home during that time frame, calling the person a \"person of interest.\"\n\nThe couple's fifth wedding anniversary would have been on Jan. 30.\n\n\"They were extraordinary people whose lives were filled with love, joy, and deep connection to others,\" the Tepe family told USA TODAY in a statement on Jan. 2.\n\nContributing: Melina Khan, Amanda Lee Myers\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Illinois man arrested for murder of ex-wife, Ohio dentist",

    "fullText": "\"The stories have been written in the stars, it seems. Literally.\"\n\nWhile scathing of the effort of many of his own players, even Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche acknowledged something is stirring at Wrexham as they knocked his Premier League side out of the FA Cup.\n\nIn front of co-owner Ryan Reynolds, the Red Dragons' class of 2025-26 etched themselves into cup folklore by taking a top-flight scalp at the Stok Cae Ras on penalties - and with drama befitting their modern-day Hollywood association.\n\nTwice they were two goals clear against last year's semi-finalists before being dragged, exhausted, into extra time, where they produced a dramatic climax.\n\nFor a club with FA Cup upsets stitched into their fabric, this win was up there with the most climactic - and the hero of the iconic win over Arsenal in 1992, Mickey Thomas, watched on.\n\nBefore the match manager Phil Parkinson said he had wished to take on a Premier League team since the club's journey up from the fifth tier began five years ago.\n\n\"We highlighted to the lads some of the great moments in this club's history in the FA Cup and could we make our own bit of history tonight. We've certainly done that,\" Parkinson said.\n\nThey did, and then some - beating top-flight opposition for the first time since 1999 to progress into round four.\n\nBut Wrexham are getting used to writing their own scripts.\n\n\"It's not just about the money, the fame and the people involved who have been amazing in the whole story, but to keep that edge and keep pushing as they're doing is tremendous,\" Dyche said.\n\nAnd, with a nod to Wrexham's position just outside the Championship play-offs, having been a non-league side as recently as 2023, he added: \"They might well add to the story.\"",

Ryan Elias found his target at the lineout and Macleod touched down from the maul.\n\nBut Pau once again silenced the sparse crowd with Tuipulotu crashing over and leaving his former side a mountain to climb.\n\nScarlets recovered from the disappointment of having a Henry Thomas try disallowed with another powerful maul, and there was no stopping Macleod once he got a sniff of a second.\n\nPau flanker Reece Hewat was shown a yellow card in the build-up, and with their tails up, Tom Rogers was quickest to pounce on a loose ball and chipped ahead for Hughes to win the foot race to the line.\n\nStill a man up after the break, Kemsley Mathias' outrageous step looked to have set up a try, but a TMO intervention showed the loose-head had been held up.\n\nScarlets kept coming and a powerful run by Plumtree broke the defensive line, and while he also looked to have been held up, the in-form flanker managed to wriggle free to ground the ball as Scarlets took the lead for the first time since the eighth minute.\n\nWith the crowd now behind them, Pau's discipline started to crumble and Hawkins finished off after the driving maul had done most of the damage.\n\nNathan Decron headed to the sin bin for an infringement, but Scarlets failed to take advantage as Pau demonstrated why they are currently the second best team in the Top 14.\n\nThey brought on their replacement forwards who made an instant impact, with prop Seneca taking advantage of some mis-communication in the defence to bust through.\n\nA careless Sam Lousi penalry gifted Pau a five metre lineout, with Attissogbe finding a gap to give his side the lead once more.\n\nFletcher Anderson looked to have come up with what could have been a winning try after Eddie James' pressure had won back possession, but the Scarlets number eight was stripped of the ball moments before grounding.\n\nLengthy replays added to the late drama, but Scarlets fans were left booing the final decision and it was Pau who finished with a flourish with well-taken tries from Attissogbe and Tokolahi.\n\nScarlets: Murray; Rogers, Roberts, James, Mee; Hawkins, Hughes; Mathias, Elias, Thomas, Lousi, Ball, Plumtree, Macleod (capt), Anderson.\n\nReplacements: Van der Merwe, Hepburn, O'Connor, Price, Davis, Blacker, Leggatt-Jones, Nicholas.\n\nPau: Attissogbe; Arfeuil, Decron, Valentino, Butlin; Desperes, Daubagna (capt); Etchebehere, Delhommel,Arrieta, Jolmes, Capelli, Zegueur, Hewat, Tuipulotu.\n\nReplacements: Rey, Seneca, Tokolahi, Liufau, Iosefo, Pelesasa, Robson, Mondinat.\n\nAssistants: Ian Kenny (Sco), Finlay Brown (Sco)\n\nSin bin: Hewat (34), Decron (50)",

With the line-out ball secured, Ene spun it wide to fellow wing O'Flaherty who ran in unopposed.\n\nJust as Sale looked like they were well on top, Sharks flanker Tshituka scored an excellent try, picking the ball from the base of a ruck and beating Ford all ends up before racing away to the line.\n\nBut the hosts hit back immediately through O'Flaherty who secured the try bonus point on 61 minutes, with the five points ensuring Sale's qualification and leaving the Sharks reliant on other results to stay in the Champions Cup.\n\nSale face a tough game at Toulouse next Saturday (17:30 GMT) which is likely to determine whether they have a home or away tie in the last 16, while the Sharks finish the pool stage with a home fixture against bottom side Clermont earlier on the same day (13:00).\n\nSale: Carpenter; Ene, Du Preez, Ma'asi-White, O'Flaherty; Ford, Warr; Rodd, Jibulu, Harper, Bamber, Van Rhyn (capt), Vermeulen, Dugdale, T Curry.\n\nReplacements: Caine, McIntyre, John, Burrow, Andrews, Hanson, Louw, Wehr.\n\nSharks: Kunene; Penxe, Venter, Julius, Malan; Masuku, Braude; Mazibuko, Swart, Koch, Rahl, Van Heerden, Mavesere, Tshituka, Hatton (capt).\n\nReplacements: Bester, Ganyane, Mdanda, Tshituka, Romao, Everson, Smith, Potgieter.\n\nAssistant referees: Adam Jones (Wal) and Ben Connor (Wal)",

    "fullText": "Having signed off at Bournemouth in fairytale fashion, Antoine Semenyo started life at Manchester City in a similarly dreamy manner just four days later by stealing the show in a record-equalling win for the club.\n\nThe forward completed a transfer from the Cherries on Friday and, although it was Exeter City in front of him for his debut, the 26-year-old duly impressed in a 10-1 FA Cup third-round mauling of the League One side.\n\nSemenyo showed early signs of why City decided to spend £65m to bring him to Etihad Stadium.\n\nHe became a fans' favourite during his three years on the south coast and a goal and assist on his first start will go a long way to ensuring supporters at his new club take to him in the same way.\n\nThe Ghanaian was named man of the match in a contest where City racked up double figures for the first time under Pep Guardiola.\n\nIt was City's biggest victory since a 10-1 Second Division thrashing of Huddersfield in 1987, and biggest in the FA Cup since a 12-0 qualifying round win over Liverpool Stanley while playing as Ardwick in 1890-91.\n\nIt was also the biggest FA Cup win from a top-flight side since Tottenham Hotspur beat Crewe 13-2 in a fourth-round replay in 1960.\n\nWith boss Guardiola serving a one-game touchline ban for receiving three yellow cards, assistant Pep Lijnders stood in for duties during the game and post-match.\n\n\"I think a lot of good performances today,\" said Lijnders. \"A lot of good individual performances. I think when the team plays like that it becomes easier for the individual, but Antoine is settling well.\n\n\"He is a humble guy and we have followed him for a long time, but he brings something to the frontline - what we really want and what we need.\n\n\"He can attack quick, he wants to chase, he is a guy who doesn't stop. I think you see today that he can adapt quite quickly to our style. It's nice to have him with us.\"",

    "fullText": "No matter who is appointed Manchester United caretaker manager until the end of the season, Darren Fletcher has emerged as one of the big winners from a week of turmoil at Old Trafford.\n\nFletcher stepped up from his day-to-day role as United's under-18s coach to replace Ruben Amorim for the games against Burnley and Brighton.\n\nThe former United and Scotland midfielder is adamant he has looked no further than that and is relaxed about what comes next.\n\nHowever, Fletcher has made a hugely positive impression on United's powerbrokers.\n\nIt maybe should not be a surprise because that is exactly what happened when he came back to the club in October 2020, and then joined Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first-team coaching set-up in January 2021.\n\n\"I was surprised I got offered the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand, so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all.\n\n\"But I know that I can do it and I'm comfortable doing it.\n\n\"I know the environment, and I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years I've been here.\n\n\"I've had great experiences as a player, took my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now.\"\n\nFletcher has done a variety of jobs since his return to Old Trafford. He initially coached the under-16s before Solskjaer called on him, believing his \"winning mentality, commitment and hard work\" would be valuable in the culture he was trying to create.\n\nOnly two months later he was appointed United's first technical director, underlining the impact he was making.\n\nA senior United figure at the time said that limited period proved to be a \"good advert\" for Fletcher, as officials gained a greater understanding of his \"intelligence\".\n\nThey saw first-hand what they felt were key elements - a hunger, tremendous work ethic and thirst for knowledge.\n\nThese were elements of the elusive DNA United had been searching for - and still are in the wake of Amorim's exit.",

    "fullText": "New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior says he did \"nothing tactical, nothing technical\" before his first match against Charlton - a sign of the likely direction of travel under his leadership.\n\nThat is not to say the 41-year-old lacks innovation or the ability to nullify opponents, but his similarities to predecessor Enzo Maresca mean he does not need to reinvent the wheel.\n\nWhen asked by BBC Sport why he had not made any noticeable tactical changes before Chelsea's 5-1 victory in the FA Cup third round, Rosenior said: \"This is a team that won the Club World Cup. That was five months ago. This is a team that won the Conference League last year. We're a good team.\n\n\"We are a good team. They've been well coached. I've made no secret of that.\"\n\nRosenior was appointed to build on Maresca's work, knowing the way Chelsea play, having been part of their multi-club model at French club Strasbourg.\n\nHowever, that is not to say there have been no changes. Chelsea have struggled to retain leads this season, dropping 15 points from winning positions in the Premier League, winning just one of their past nine league matches.\n\n\"No, I think the biggest thing I challenged the players on was our reactions to setbacks, our intensity. I was very happy with the togetherness and the spirit of the group today,\" Rosenior added.\n\n\"I was very happy with the intensity that they ran at – winning duels, winning headers, all of the basics. And that's where you get your joy from.\"\n\nSources involved in Rosenior's first sessions say intensity was a key theme, one of the principles he hammered home in his first media conference, and something that has, at times, been a failing for Chelsea during long spells of ponderous possession.\n\nThey have also been vulnerable at set-pieces and again conceded when Miles Leaburn made it 2-1 in the second half at The Valley, before running out comfortable winners.\n\n\"We need to improve in that aspect as well – long throws, wide free-kicks, corners going into our box. They are the basics that I talk about in football,\" Rosenior explained.\n\nIt appears the system and style of play is low on Rosenior's to-do list, with so many matches to come, and such little time to prepare.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur's belated show of spirit may keep the wolf from head coach Thomas Frank's door a little longer, but a damaging FA Cup defeat reaffirms the lingering belief his time in charge is only heading one way.\n\nIf there is scant consolation for Frank after Spurs slumped to a 2-1 third-round loss at home to Aston Villa, it is that the mood at the end was nowhere near as ugly as it threatened to be at half-time.\n\nDig beneath that and - barring a trip to Fantasyland in which Spurs win the Champions League - the rest of this season is now a quest for respectability, and for Frank, survival.\n\nSpurs supporters sent their team off at the interval with deafening jeers ringing in their ears after they were brushed aside by a vastly superior Villa, who established a fully deserved 2-0 advantage.\n\nSuch was the lack of hope that thousands of seats inside the vast Tottenham Hotspur Stadium remained empty for even longer than usual at the start of the second half, fans resigned to Spurs' fate after a dismal first 45 minutes in which they conceded goals to Emiliano Buendia and Morgan Rogers.\n\nIt was deeply uncomfortable for Frank, who not only felt the full fury of the Spurs fans he is failing to convince, but also the taunts of thousands of travelling Villa supporters revelling in his misery.\n\nAs well as the time-honoured \"You're getting sacked in the morning\", he heard chants of \"Thomas Frank is an Arsenal fan\" after he was inadvertently pictured drinking from a Gunners-branded coffee cup before the Premier League defeat at Bournemouth.\n\nHelped by complacency from Villa, who came out for the second half looking like their work was done, Spurs at least competed and poured forward, with Wilson Odobert's 54th-minute goal offering a lifeline.\n\nThe stadium threw its support behind their team, who finally posed a threat, although too often it was frenzied rather than composed when opportunities arose.",

Our game is always to move the ball and that suits my game down to a tee. The boys are flourishing, there's a long way we can go and it's a very promising sign going forward.\n\n\"I don't score many tries so I'll take it when they come, it's nice to get tries but it's a solid win and big five points for us.\"\n\nLeicester travel to South Africa to play Stormers next Saturday (15:15 GMT), while Bayonne host Leinster at the same time.\n\nItoje starts as Saracens face Toulouse -Sunday's Champions Cup team news\n\nLeicester: Steward; Radwan, Wand, Bailey, Hamer-Webb; Searle, Van Poortvliet; Smith, Clare, Heyes, Henderson, Chessum (capt), Thompson, Reffell, Cracknell.\n\nReplacements: Blamire, Haffar, Hurd, Moro, Ilione, Whiteley, Woodward, Pearson.\n\nBayonne: Spring; Lapegue, Martocq, Tuilagi, Hannoun; Boyle-Tiatia, Tilloles; Calles, Martin, Cotet, Iturria (capt), Garcia Iandolino, Leota, Marchesin, Ariceta.\n\nReplacements: Bosch, Tumania, Tagi, Johnson, Traversier, Jantjies, Thompson, Rasal.\n\nAssistant referees: Ru Campbell (Sco) and Jonny MacKenzie (Sco)",
