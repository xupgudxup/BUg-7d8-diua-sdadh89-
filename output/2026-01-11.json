Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Rams entered Saturday evening’s joust with the Panthers as heavy favorites. Among the biggest reasons why was star hurler Matthew Stafford. Los Angeles’ veteran signal-caller authored an MVP-caliber campaign, amassing a league-leading total in passing touchdowns and passing yards.\n\nAgainst Carolina, Stafford appeared destined to recreate his regular-season success. He successfully tossed arrows all across the Bank of America Stadium plains in the first two quarter, conjuring spells against the Panthers' weary defense.\n\nStafford's performance faded as the match wore on, felled by an inspired Carolina rearguard and an apparent hand injury. Nevertheless, his first-half showing was enough to see him climb up the Rams’ record books.\n\nWith that, here’s a look at Stafford’s performance vs. Carolina by the numbers.\n\nMORE: Why Rico Dowdle split reps with Chuba Hubbard vs. Rams\n\nHalftime score: Rams 17, Panthers 14\n\nStafford put forth an impressive display in the first half, collecting yardage in bunches. He connected with Puka Nacua for one score and set the BYU alum up for another, although the play was eventually ruled a run play.\n\nStafford's efficiency was noteworthy. He found his target on eight of his first nine throws, producing a passer rating that would rank as one of the best in postseason history.\n\nAll that amounted to an efficient and effective first half showing for Stafford, who reiterated his MVP credentials with another glistening display — this time, under the playoff lights.\n\nMORE: Meet Matthew Stafford’s wife, Kelly, along with his four daughters\n\nStafford's first-half outburst surged him to the top of Los Angeles' postseason record books. He became the Rams' all-time leading playoff passer against the Panthers, eclipsing a host of icons — including Kurt Warner — to take the title of best postseason hurler in franchise history.\n\nMORE: Puka Nacua stats performance vs. Panthers\n\nHere's a look at where he stands on the Rams' all-time list:\n\nWhile Stafford enjoyed another sterling day under the lights, the numbers he accrue throughout the postseason will not count towards his MVP candidacy. Votes for the famous award have already been filed, meaning that Stafford cannot actually improve his chances at landing the prize.\n\nSN's expert predictions for NFL playoffs, Super Bowl 60\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nStafford is a Super Bowl champion, having hoisted the hardware in 2022 after leading Los Angeles to a 23-20 win over the Bengals in Super Bowl 56.\n\nStafford wasn't quite faultless in his showing. He tossed two interceptions on the day, seeing his patented efficiency slow amid Cincinnati's harrowing pass rush.\n\nStill, his final line was reflective of one of his generation's best gunslingers: 26-of-40 passing for 283 yards, three touchdowns and two picks.",

    "fullText": "Is Matthew Stafford injured? Rams QB's performance dips after taking hit to hand vs. Panthers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMatthew Stafford enjoyed a sizzling start during the Rams’ joust with the Panthers in Saturday’s wild-card game. Los Angeles’ wily veteran completed eight of his first nine passes, setting up Puka Nacua with a touchdown as the Rams opened a 14-point advantage over their heavily favored opposition.\n\nBut as the game wore on and Carolina built its way back into the contest, things changed for Stafford. Plays that once appeared routine for the 37-year-old proved far more challenging. Incompletions piled up for the MVP frontrunner, leaving many uncertain about what had changed.\n\nFox’s broadcast crew suggested Stafford’s struggles weren’t organic, but rather the result of an injury to his throwing hand. While the malady might not fully explain some of Stafford’s uncharacteristic mistakes, it could provide some context for his foibles.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Stafford’s status following his alleged hand injury.\n\nThings were humming for Stafford in the first half. The Super Bowl champion laced passes all about the Bank of America Stadium pitch, finding his target with increasing regularity.\n\nBut partway through the second quarter, Stafford was momentarily cut down by injury. As he attempted a throw, he hit his hand on the crown of an onrushing Carolina defender.\n\nMatthew Stafford appeared to have hurt his hand in the first half ⬇️\n\n📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/QQo0FHNW0N\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 10, 2026\n\nStafford gripped his hand and grimaced as he rose off the turf, flexing his hand tightly. His efficiency faded as the game wore on, with incompletions — and an interception — spilling into his previously faultless display.\n\nThere was a marked difference in Stafford's showing before and after his apparent injury. Stafford started the day flawless — 8-of-8 for 107 yards and one touchdown. After clattering his hand against the Panthers rusher, he went 16-of-34 with 197 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Noted for his patented efficiency, Stafford's throws lost their luster slightly as the game continued. He found his form when it counted, though, finding Cody Parkinson with a delicate toss in the corner of the end zone to deliver a four-point win to Los Angeles.",

An official team announcement confirms he is still dealing with a calf contusion.\n\nConsidering Morant’s name is back in the trade rumor mill, many see the sudden wave as absences as something deeper than a contusion.

The Grizzlies ultimately ruled out Morant each time, but they didn’t waste any time ruling him out for the January 9 battle against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nGrizzlies head coach Tuomas Iisalo told reporters on Friday night that Morant is not experiencing a setback at this time.\n\nWhile the Grizzlies are reportedly fielding calls for a potential Morant trade, they haven’t ruled out keeping him on board and building around him.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Indiana Hoosiers are on the doorstep of college football history, carrying an unbeaten season into the national championship game with a chance to accomplish something no modern team ever has.\n\nAt 15-0, Indiana is already one of just five teams in the modern era to reach that mark. A win against the Miami Hurricanes would make the Hoosiers the first major college football program to finish 16-0 since Yale Bulldogs accomplished the feat in 1894 — an era of leather helmets and no forward pass.\n\nWhat makes Indiana’s run even more remarkable is how it was built. The Hoosiers entered the season without a single five-star recruit, leaning instead on development and precision under second-year coach Curt Cignetti. Once one of the most consistent rebuild jobs in the Big Ten, Indiana is now one win from the most dominant single season in program history.\n\nMore: Fernando Mendoza's family ties to Mario Cristobal run deep with Miami homecoming\n\nIndiana announced itself on the sport’s biggest stage with a 56-22 dismantling of the Oregon Ducks in the Peach Bowl.

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Hayes Fawcett, the Texas Longhorns have landed a commitment from linebacker Rasheem Biles out of the NCAA transfer portal. Biles spent the last two seasons with the Pitt Panthers, turning into an All-ACC player. Steve Sarkisian and new defensive coordinator Will Muschamp now take over his talents, hoping it translates in the SEC.\n\nLinebacker has been a position of importance for Texas in the transfer portal this offseason. There has been plenty of turnover there, both due to the 2026 NFL Draft and guys leaving for other schools. Somebody with the ability to bring an immediate impact was needed in Austin, and Biles is the guy.\n\nBiles played in 10 games last season for Pitt, starting in nine of them. A total of 101 tackles, 17 tackles for a loss, and 4.5 interceptions proved to be good enough for second-team All-ACC honors. You can add in two interceptions (both of which were returned for touchdowns), six passes defended, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. Basically, Biles was all over the field this past year.\n\nIf those stats were not enough, the On3 Industry Transfer Portal rankings believe one of the very best is heading to Texas. Biles is a four-star prospect and the No. 16 overall player to enter this cycle. Nobody is ranked higher when it comes to the linebacker position, either.\n\nPlenty of other schools were interested in Biles’ commitment during the transfer process. The likes of Colorado, Miami, Michigan, and Ohio State were a part of the discussion at one point. Instead, Texas found a way to get this one over the finish line.\n\nThe Longhorns are coming off a disappointing season, going 9-3 and missing the College Football Playoff. Sarkisian is working to retool the roster so the same fate is not shared at the conclusion of the 2026 season. Plenty of work remains but snagging somebody like Biles is a massive step in the right direction.\n\nTexas will open the ’26 campaign on Sept. 5 vs. Texas State, where you can assume it will be debut day for Biles. One week later will grab all the attention, though, as Ohio State comes to Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium for the first time since 2006.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

Carolina’s draft position is now locked into place at No. 19. The rest of the teams that lose this weekend will fill in slots 20-24.\n\nCarolina ranked near the bottom of the NFL in 2026 in sacks with 30, and edge rusher is absolutely a top need heading into free agency and the draft. Rico Dowdle was the team’s leading rusher, with 1,076 yards and six rushing touchdowns, plus contributed 297 receiving yards and a touchdown through the air, and he’s hitting free agency. Christian Rozeboom, the Panthers’ tackles leader who also had two sacks, three pass break-ups, a pick and a forced fumble, will also become a free agent when the new league year ends. The Panthers are projected to have about $39 million in cap space to work with this offseason based on the 51-man projection, but obviously when they can shore up these key positions through the draft, it makes long-term team building for success easier.\n\nHere’s the updated draft order after the Panthers’ Wild Card exit.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (via Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (via Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (via Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (via Jacksonville Jaguars)",

Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe are grateful to the International Tax Policy Forum for financial support of this project.

    "description": "Why the doomsayers are wrong: npm, PyPI, and NuGet downloads are exploding",
    "fullText": "Earlier this week, Adam Wathan, the creator of Tailwind CSS, dropped a bombshell about how AI has impacted his company and its employees:\n\nthe reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. And every second I spend trying to do fun free things for the community like this is a second I’m not spending trying to turn the business around and make sure the people who are still here are getting their paychecks every month.\n\nThe reaction was swift and predictable. Hot takes flooded in declaring the death of open source, the end of OSS sustainability, and the AI apocalypse that would render libraries and frameworks obsolete. Geoffrey Huntley captured the prevailing narrative perfectly1:\n\n“AI can generate code, bypassing the need to deal with open-source woes… I’ve found myself using less open source these days… This shift challenges the role of open-source ecosystems.”\n\nI had a tweet about the Tailwind situation go viral and there were dozens of quote tweets and comments echoing the very same. “AI eats open source” is easy to find in abundance online.\n\nHere’s the problem: everyone is getting this perfectly backwards.\n\nAI isn’t killing open source. It’s amplifying it to unprecedented levels. The Tailwind situation isn’t about declining OSS adoption - it’s about a business model that was working great in a world where learning curves were high and documentation was the bottleneck. That world is gone, and the revenue model built on top of it is collapsing. But the underlying Tailwind library? It’s thriving.\n\nLet me show you why the doomsayers are wrong, backed by actual data from our own experience with Akka.NET and broader ecosystem trends that tell a very different story.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a two-part series. This post covers why AI is accelerating open source adoption, not killing it. Part 2 examines which business models thrive and which collapse in the AI era - and what Tailwind’s situation teaches us about adapting. \n\nI’ve been maintaining Akka.NET, a complex distributed systems framework, for over a decade. If AI was going to kill any open source project, it should have be ours. Actor model? Message-passing? Concurrency? Distributed systems? This is exactly the kind of “complex stuff” that AI should supposedly generate on the fly, right?\n\nWe’re not an outlier. Let me show you three very different frameworks - all thriving:\n\nTailwind CSS - The framework at the center of this controversy:\n\nTailwind more than doubled its downloads in 2025. The framework that supposedly proves AI is killing open source had its best year ever - by a massive margin.\n\nNServiceBus - Enterprise messaging framework (15+ years old, commercial licensing):\n\nNServiceBus is exactly the kind of enterprise infrastructure Geoffrey Huntley expects AI to replace. And it’s growing at 35%+ annually - the same rate as before AI coding tools existed. And it’s been commercially licensed for years - surely someone who wanted this type of functionality would just fire up Claude Code to eliminate it, right?\n\nAccording to Sonatype’s State of the Software Supply Chain 20242 report:\n\nIf AI was replacing open source libraries, why are package downloads exploding at unprecedented rates? Why are dependency counts climbing? Why is every major package registry showing record growth?\n\nThe answer is simple: AI is discovering and adopting open source libraries faster than humans ever could.\n\nHere’s what the AI doomsayers fundamentally misunderstand about how Large Language Models work: they’re trained to find the shortest path to a working solution.\n\nWhen you ask Claude or GPT-5 to build a distributed system, what do you think is the shorter path?\n\nOption A: Generate thousands of lines of custom actor model implementation, cluster management, network protocols, failure detectors, and state replication logic - all from scratch, all needing testing, all potentially buggy.\n\nOption B: dotnet add package Akka and configure the proven, tested, battle-hardened framework that’s in the training data with millions of examples.\n\nThe LLM isn’t stupid. It’s going to pick Option B every single time, unless you explicitly tell it not to - and even then it might fight you3.\n\nThis is why the “AI will generate everything custom” narrative falls apart on contact with reality. Yes, AI can generate custom components. But developers don’t want custom CSS frameworks - they want to ship. They want the thing that makes them money shipped yesterday. Using established libraries is how you get there expeditiously.\n\nHere’s where it gets really interesting. Established open source projects have a massive, compounding advantage in the AI era: years of training data.\n\nThink about what’s in those training sets:\n\nEvery time someone asks “how do I build a distributed system in .NET?” the training data screams “AKKA.NET” across thousands of documents. The LLM doesn’t need to think creatively. It’s pattern matching against an enormous corpus of successful implementations.\nThis creates a virtuous cycle:\n\nPopular projects have more training data → LLMs recommend them more → More people use them → More training data gets created → The cycle continues.\n\nThe rich get richer, and in this case, that’s actually a good thing for software quality.\n\nNow compare that to generating a custom solution. The LLM has… what? Generic distributed systems theory? Sure. But where are the battle-tested examples? Where are the debugging sessions? Where are the “here’s what went wrong in production and how we fixed it” stories?\n\nThey don’t exist. Because you’re asking the AI to invent something new.\n\nRemember when adopting a new library meant:\n\nFor a human developer, that’s a full day or two of investment before you’re productive. The mental math was always: “Is learning this library worth the time investment vs. building something custom that I already understand?”\n\nAI just arbitraged that entire calculation out of existence.\n\nWhen I ask Claude to “implement an Akka.NET cluster with cluster sharding and split-brain resolution,” it doesn’t need to read the docs. It doesn’t need the tutorial. It usually outputs working code with proper configuration in seconds. The learning curve is effectively zero.\n\nThis fundamentally changes the adoption math. The barrier to using any established library is now “can the AI generate correct code for it?” If yes, adoption becomes frictionless.\n\nGuess which libraries have the most examples for AI to learn from? The established ones. The popular ones. The ones with network effects and community momentum.\n\nAI can generate impressive things from scratch. People have used agentic loops to build entire programming languages, compilers, and complex systems - all generated by AI with minimal human intervention. These are genuine technical achievements that prove AI can build sophisticated software.\n\nBut here’s the question nobody’s asking: would you run your production systems on them?\n\nThe answer depends entirely on blast radius - what happens when things go wrong4.\n\nThe libraries that AI can safely replace are the ones with low blast radius. If your AI-generated UI component looks a little funny or renders slightly different than expected, nobody dies. You fix it and move on. The cost of failure is measured in minutes of debugging.\n\nBut if your AI-generated embedded operating system core dumps constantly? Someone might actually die. If your AI-generated authentication library has a subtle flaw? You get breached. If your AI-generated distributed consensus algorithm has an edge case bug? You lose data across your entire cluster.\n\nProduction systems don’t run on “technically works” - they run on battle-hardened, community-tested, security-audited infrastructure that’s been proven across thousands of deployments over years. That’s React. Linux. PostgreSQL. Akka.NET. NServiceBus. The boring, reliable stuff that’s growing 35-126% annually.\n\nThere’s another dimension here: institutionalized experience.\n\nA venerable codebase like Akka.NET doesn’t just contain code - it contains decades of accumulated wisdom across millions of deployments and tens of thousands of applications. All running on different hardware, serving different use cases, developed by different people. Every bug fix is a production war story. Every edge case handler is a lesson learned the hard way. Every configuration option exists because someone, somewhere, needed it in production.\n\nLLMs can synthesize code. They can pattern-match against training data. But they are no substitute for thousands of person-years of lived experience encoded into a codebase. That wisdom doesn’t exist in the training data - it exists in the accumulated decisions of maintainers who’ve seen every way a distributed system can fail.\n\nWhen you dotnet add package Akka, you’re not just getting code. You’re getting the institutional memory of a decade of production deployments. AI can’t generate that. It can only recommend the libraries that already have it.\n\nThe libraries actually at risk from AI generation are the ones with low blast radius - simple utilities, UI components, basic tooling where failure is cheap and recoverable. The critical infrastructure where failure is catastrophic? That’s not going anywhere. It’s accelerating.\n\n“Sure,” I hear you saying, “AI won’t replace frameworks, but what about all the smaller libraries? What about utilities and helpers?”\n\nFair question. Let’s think through the actual use cases.\n\nDeveloper needs a date formatting function. AI can generate it. But… so could a library. And the library version is tested. And documented. And handles edge cases. And gets security updates.\n\nWhat’s actually happening in practice? AI is finding and using existing utility libraries faster than humans would have. date-fns, lodash, NodaTime - these libraries aren’t declining, they’re exploding in adoption.5\n\nScenario 2: Custom Business Logic\n\nDeveloper needs a specific component for their application. AI generates it custom. Perfect! This is exactly what should be custom. This was never the domain of reusable open source anyway.\n\nScenario 3: Complex, Critical Systems\n\nDeveloper needs authentication, database access, distributed coordination, payment processing. AI could generate custom implementations. But would you ship them to production? Would you stake your business on AI-generated cryptography? On custom distributed consensus?\n\nOf course not. You use Postgres, Entity Framework, Akka.NET, OpenSSL - the proven solutions with years of production hardening.\n\nHere’s what the Tailwind situation actually tells us: AI is devastating businesses that sell what LLMs can generate.\n\nThe numbers tell the whole story:\n\nThe most successful year in the framework’s history coincided with the business collapse. This isn’t a contradiction - it’s the clearest illustration of what AI actually disrupts.\n\nTailwind’s commercial business is Tailwind Plus - premium UI components, templates, and blocks. The free documentation served as the primary sales funnel: developers would visit the docs to learn Tailwind, discover the premium components, and purchase them.\n\nAI broke this model in two devastating ways.\n\nFirst: The sales funnel dried up.\n\nRemember learning curve arbitrage? When developers use AI to generate Tailwind code, they don’t need to visit the documentation. Adam noted that docs traffic is down about 40% from early 2023 - despite Tailwind being more popular than ever. Fewer eyeballs on the docs means fewer people discovering the premium products exist.\n\nSecond: The product itself became AI-generatable.\n\nAI undercut Tailwind’s business model. Selling those components was about eliminating friction for users - buy a pre-made pricing table instead of building one yourself. But AI found an even cheaper way to eliminate that friction: generate the component on demand, for free.\n\nWhen a developer asks an AI for a “responsive pricing table with Tailwind,” the LLM isn’t going to say “log into your Tailwind Plus account and download the pricing component.” It’s going to generate one from scratch. That’s the shortest path.\n\nUI components and templates are exactly the kind of low-blast-radius output that AI handles well. If the generated component looks slightly different than a premium template, nobody cares. You tweak it and move on.\n\nTailwind’s business model put them directly in competition with their own framework’s AI-assisted usage. The better AI gets at generating Tailwind code, the less reason anyone has to buy pre-built components.\n\nThe framework thrives. The component business struggles. Same company, opposite trajectories - because one benefits from AI adoption and the other is displaced by it.\n\nAI isn’t killing open source. It’s creating the golden age of open source consumption.\n\nMore developers can adopt more libraries faster than ever before. The friction that kept people building custom solutions has evaporated. The learning curves that protected mediocre alternatives have disappeared.\n\nWhat we’re seeing is consolidation around quality, acceleration of adoption, and the destruction of business models that were built on selling what AI can now generate.\n\nTailwind CSS isn’t dying. Tailwind Plus might be dying - time will tell to see how they pivot. But the CSS framework itself is more popular than ever. The component products built on top of it? Those are being outcompeted by the LLMs recommending the framework.\n\nIf you’re an open source maintainer, this is your moment. If you’ve built something genuinely valuable - critical infrastructure with high blast radius, strong community, clear use cases - you’re about to see adoption curves that would have taken a decade compress into a few years.\n\nThe future of open source isn’t bleak. It’s brighter than it’s ever been. But the businesses built on top of them? That’s a different story - and it’s what we’ll dig into in Part 2.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a two-part series. Part 2 examines which open source business models thrive and which collapse in the AI era. The same AI wave that disrupted Tailwind’s business certainly didn’t hurt ours - our support subscriptions grew 19% in 2025, and AI-driven adoption likely contributed. Part 2 examines what makes some OSS business models resilient while others struggle. \n\nWhat’s your experience been? Are you seeing AI tools increase or decrease your open source usage? Hit me up on Twitter/X - I’m curious to hear how this is playing out across different ecosystems.\n\nGeoff wrote this all the way back in June 2025, well before this Tailwind situation.

    "description": "Sakana AI Agent Wins AtCoder Heuristic Contest (First AI to Place 1st)",
    "fullText": "Sakana AI’s “ALE-Agent” achieved a historic milestone by securing 1st place in the AtCoder Heuristic Contest 058, outperforming 804 human participants. To contextualize the difficulty of these optimization challenges, an OpenAI agent previously secured 2nd place in the AHC world tournament last August. This victory marks the first known instance of an AI agent winning a major optimization programming contest in real-time. The result demonstrates that by utilizing inference-time scaling with multiple frontier models, AI agents can now match or exceed the performance of top human experts in complex tasks requiring extended reasoning.\n\nDuring the 4-hour contest, our agent autonomously discovered a novel algorithm that outperformed the problem setters’ intended solution. While the problem setters’ anticipated a standard approach combining constructive heuristics and simulated annealing (SA), our ALE-Agent independently derived a “virtual power” heuristic and a sophisticated SA strategy with diverse neighborhood search operations, allowing it to escape local optima more effectively than human competitors.\n\nOperating at a total cost of approximately $1,300, the agent engaged in parallel code generation and iterative analysis, proving that AI is now capable of the original scientific discovery and trial-and-error required for high-level problem solving.\n\nFor the detailed information, including the logs and analysis output by ALE-Agent during the contest, see: https://sakanaai.github.io/fishylene-ahc058/ and our earlier NeurIPS’25 paper.\n\nThe AtCoder Heuristic Contest (AHC) is a series of programming competitions focused on optimization problems related to real-world industrial challenges, such as logistics optimization and factory production scheduling. These contests are characterized by approximately 1,000 programmers including experts active in various industrial sectors. Participants tackle a single, complex coding challenge, with contest durations ranging from four hours to two weeks.\n\nAHC has garnered significant global attention. In August 2025, a world championship featuring top-tier players was held, where an AI agent from OpenAI participated and won 2nd place. Sakana AI has also co-developed ALE-Bench, a benchmark platform based on AHC, in collaboration with AtCoder Inc. Furthermore, under special permission, our AI agent called ALE-Agent has been continuously participating in AHCs in real-time.\n\nAHC058, held on December 14, 2025, was conducted over a 4-hour competition window. The problem involved a setting where participants could produce machines with hierarchical relationships, such as multiple types of “apple-producing machines” and “machines that build those machines.” The objective was to construct an efficient production planning algorithm by determining which types and hierarchies of machines to upgrade and in what specific order.\n\nWhile the setting may seem humorous at first glance, these hierarchical production dependencies mirror real-world supply chains, food webs, and manufacturing processes, making it a scientifically interesting problem setup. For further details on the problem, please refer to the contest’s problem statement.\n\nALE-Agent began making submissions two hours after the contest started and immediately leapt to 1st place in the provisional standings.\n\nIn the middle of the contest, ALE-Agent was in a fierce dead heat with yosupo, the eventual 2nd-place finisher. ALE-Agent regained 1st place approximately two and a half hours into the contest and maintained the lead until the end to secure the victory.\n\nIn AHC058, the solution expected by the problem author was an approach that used algorithms like Greedy methods or Beam Search to determine a global strategic plan, followed by Simulated Annealing (SA) to refine the plan’s finer details.\n\nALE-Agent’s answer followed the same basic flow as a human: “construction by Greedy → refinement by SA.” However, it was a quintessential “AI-style” solution that maximized the AI’s strengths: numerous implementations and exhaustive trial and error. Analysis of the final program revealed the following characteristics:\n\nAnalyzing the process through which ALE-Agent generated its response revealed that it implemented the solution while deepening its understanding of the problem’s characteristics. (Logs can be viewed on this page).\n\nThe latest version of ALE-Agent is equipped with a mechanism to repeat trial and error by generating multiple programs simultaneously, summarizing those results to generate insights, and utilizing them for subsequent code generation. Looking at the insights generated by ALE-Agent, we can see it examining the problem based on experience; it mentioned the compound interest effect in connection with investment knowledge, devised high-speed algorithms using mathematics from an early stage, and discussed the nature of the search space, noting that initial strategies cause significant differences.\n\nWe received comments regarding ALE-Agent’s performance and approach from two experts familiar with the optimization field and AHC.\n\nFrom Hiroomi Nochide (AtCoder handle: itigo):\n\nActually, before the contest started, I thought this problem would be difficult for LLMs. This is because solving this problem with a Greedy method requires experimental insight that LLMs typically struggle with, and I thought a high score would be impossible without this human-centric consideration. However, when the results came out, I was stunned to see fishylene win.\n\nChecking the logs, it tried a vast number of patterns with promising directions and discovered a clever simulated annealing method that was not anticipated at the time the problem was created. I am impressed, thinking, ‘How did it find such a method?’ (In the logs, the parts requiring the experimental insight I initially expected did not appear, and given that humans still excelled in the Greedy portion, I believe human accuracy in consideration is still superior. However,) the overwhelming number of trial-and-error steps combined with LLM reasoning is an advantage humans do not have. While I feel fishylene is a formidable rival, I believe this technology will be a tremendous weapon for humanity.\n\n(Note: fishylene is ALE-Agent’s AtCoder account name)\n\nHiroomi Nochide authored the problem for AHC058. He is one of the world’s top players (24th in AHC world rankings) and a professional in this field at ALGO ARTIS CORPORATION.\n\nFrom Yoichi Iwata (AtCoder handle: wata):\n\nThis problem required optimizing investment plans for multiple series of production machines, where the high-level choice of which series to select as ‘final investment targets’ and ‘intermediate investment targets’ was essentially the core issue. With simple local improvement methods that only slightly change the investment target at each turn, it is difficult to switch this global strategy midway, often leading to poor local optima.\n\nThe expected solution from the author’s side was a two-stage approach: first explore a wide range of global investment plan candidates using a lightweight solver, and then spend time optimizing the promising ones. In contrast, the solutions from ALE-Agent and the runner-up, yosupo, were based on local search but introduced ‘Large Neighborhoods’ that change a huge portion of the investment plan at once to escape local optima. In particular, ALE-Agent utilized a diversified Greedy method to reconstruct large parts of the plan, which seems to have led to its performance advantage.\n\nHistorically, ALE-Agent has tended to choose solutions within the author’s expected range, yet its high implementation and optimization power allowed it to reach the top ranks among many participants using similar methods, especially in short-duration contests. This time, it was very impressive to see it go one step further and reach a solution that exceeded the author’s expectations.\n\nYoichi Iwata oversees AHC at AtCoder. He has an outstanding track record in this field, including winning the 2010 TopCoder Open. His scores in pre-contest test plays sometimes exceed the top participant scores, and he ensures the high quality of AHC problems.\n\nALE-Agent is an agent that performs algorithm discovery by utilizing multiple LLMs to create solutions in parallel, selecting the best ones, and reasoning further based on the results of trial and error. As such, it requires a high volume of LLM calls. The resources utilized during the 4-hour contest were as follows:\n\nThis result is significant as it demonstrates that even for multi-hour tasks, by scaling inference costs and running a properly designed AI agent, AI can reach or surpass the performance of top human experts.\n\nIdentifying which specific elements of ALE-Agent’s design contributed most to this dramatic result remains an important research task for the future. Our current analysis suggests that in addition to scaling LLM calls and injecting domain knowledge, a “self-learning mechanism,” which extracts insights from trial-and-error trajectory and reflects them in the next improvement cycle, played an important role.\n\nAs highlighted in evaluation reports such as those from METR (Model Evaluation and Threat Research), the latest AI models are beginning to show high proficiency in tasks requiring several hours of human effort. Our result follows this trend but is unique in showing that an AI agent with appropriate mechanisms and inference scaling can rival top human experts.\n\nHowever, at this point, AI does not always rival or surpass top humans. The table below shows ALE-Agent’s past performance. While ALE-Agent has often ranked highly in previous AHCs, AHC058 marks its first victory. Additionally, its calculated virtual rating is 2592, which corresponds to 66th place among active users.\n\nAVisualization of ALE-Agent’s past AHC performance and Rating. The graph shows the contribution of performance values from each contest to the overall rating. https://atcoder-graphs.vercel.app/#contributorGraph\n\nLooking ahead, we aim to increase stability to ensure consistently high performance across similar tasks and to evolve our agents to rival top experts in longer-term tasks lasting several days or more. To achieve this, we will focus on balancing efficient human-like thinking with trial and error (moving away from purely heavy LLM call reliance) and acquiring more advanced autonomous management capabilities.\n\nIn real-world problem-solving, the process where humans interpret, generalize, and refine the unexpected discoveries presented by AI is highly effective. As noted in our report on the ICFP Programming Contest 2025, Sakana AI positions AI not as a replacement for humans, but as a partner that expands human exploration capabilities. Measuring achievements by AI alone, as we did here, is vital for understanding the current strengths and weaknesses of AI as a partner, and we believe this result represents a significant milestone in that journey.\n\nFinally, we would like to express our deep gratitude to AtCoder Inc. for their continuous cooperation and to ALGO ARTIS CORPORATION for hosting this contest.\n\nSakana AI will continue to explore new possibilities for intelligence and the practical application of AI agents in the real world.\n\nSakana AI is looking for experienced software engineers to lead the productization of platforms that solve complex real-world problems and accelerate AI-driven discovery, including projects like ALE-Agent. We are also looking for interns interested in the further development and industrial application of AI agents. Join our team and help us turn cutting-edge AI agent technology into practical value.\n\nDetails and Application: https://sakana.ai/careers/",

    "fullText": "In most healthcare organizations, AI adoption didn't begin with a strategy document or a formal approval process.\n\nIt began organically with individuals hearing about how AI could help them do their jobs better, easier. Who doesn't want that? So, they start using AI tools to summarize notes, draft communications, interpret documents, or explore ideas faster. Often with good intentions. Often without visibility.\n\nWhether an organization has formally approved AI usage or not, the reality is the same: AI is already in the workflow.\n\nThe real question is no longer if employees are using AI.\n\nIt's whether that usage is intentional, governed, and defensible.\n\nMany organizations respond to AI risk in one of two ways:\n\nNeither approach reflects how work actually gets done.\n\nWhen tools are banned outright, usage tends to move underground.\n\nWhen policies exist without enforcement or structure, teams are left guessing where the boundaries really are.\n\nIn both cases, leadership loses visibility causing compliance risk to go up.\n\nThe most common AI risk in healthcare isn't malicious behavior or reckless intent.\n\nIt's the absence of a clear boundary between sensitive work and external AI systems.\n\nIn regulated environments, invisible usage is often riskier than visible, governed usage.\n\nA compliance gateway is not about surveillance.\n\nIt's not about monitoring individuals or second-guessing intent.\n\nA compliance gateway is an organizational control layer that sits between employees and AI systems, making AI usage:\n\nInstead of relying solely on policy documents or trust, organizations provide a clear, approved path for AI usage that aligns with regulatory obligations.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths about AI governance is that it slows teams down.\n\nThey spend less time guessing, self-censoring, or avoiding AI altogether.\n\nGovernance, when done well, becomes an enabler.\n\nHealthcare compliance is rarely about eliminating risk entirely.\n\nIt's about managing risk intentionally.\n\nOrganizations that struggle most with AI compliance are often not the ones using AI aggressively. They're the ones who can't see how it's being used at all.\n\nVisibility enables informed decision making, targeted controls, and credible explanations when questions arise.\n\nWithout visibility, even well-meaning organizations are forced to rely on hope.\n\nAs AI becomes embedded in everyday healthcare workflows, governance will increasingly shift:\n\nThe organizations that adapt successfully won't be the ones that stopped AI usage.\n\nThey'll be the ones that made it explicit, governed, and defensible.\n\nEmployees are already bringing AI into healthcare work because the incentives are real and the productivity gains are tangible.\n\nThe choice facing organizations isn't whether to allow AI.\n\nIt's whether AI usage will happen outside of governance or within it.\n\nGuardian Health is being built as a governed AI workbench for healthcare teams: designed to sit between employees and AI systems, making data handling decisions explicit, auditable, and defensible. Our focus is less on controlling behavior, and more on providing clear, compliant pathways for real-world AI usage.",

    "description": "The company's CEO said the ordeal has “been a difficult chapter.”",
    "fullText": "A well-known coffee brand has filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAs it turns out, its Compass Coffee.\n\nThe 25-unit chain based in the DMW market filed on Tuesday, and it’s all because of a lasting, “massive” impact leftover from the pandemic.\n\nWith a plan in place, the company intends to sell itself to “a strategic buyer with a substantial, global presence in the retail coffee business.”\n\nPlanning to file an asset purchase agreement, it will designate the buyer as the stalking horse bidder, which means the buyer sets the baseline that other bidders must beat, according to QSR.\n\nCompass will refuse the leases of 10 locations that aren’t producing profit, including its former headquarters and roastery, which is part of the bankruptcy.\n\nThe entirety of brand’s locations are based in Washington, D.C., Southern Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nCurrently, the company owes $11.7 million and has found itself sued by a number of landlords and venders over past due rent or other payments.\n\nComing to the aid of Compass is one of its investors – National Investment Group – which has committed to providing up to $450,000 in debtor-in-possession financing to help Compass fund bankruptcy restructuring costs and power through the sales process.\n\nBut the funds can’t be finalized until a judge signs off on it.\n\nAccording to what CEO and cofounder Michael Haft admitted in a LinkedIn post, the entire ordeal has “been a difficult chapter.”\n\n“The decisions we’re making reflect the reality of this moment in Washington and are about ensuring Compass can continue serving the city with the same real good coffee and sense of community that have defined us from the beginning.”\n\nIn court documents, Haft noted that the brand witnessed the “loss of considerable revenue” amid the pandemic as it was forced to downsize its workforce.\n\nCompass attempted to offset the loss of income by developing an in-house roastery and distribution business.\n\nBut things haven’t returned back to how it was before the pandemic due to fewer government employees and an increase of remote work in the area.\n\nThough some locations have stayed profitable, others are either “minimally profitable” or unprofitable. In order to slash costs, Compass came out of its coffee distribution business to focus on the main business of café’s.\n\n“Downtown was busy, people gathered in offices and cafés every day, and Compass grew alongside the city,” Haft said in his LinkedIn post.\n\n“That rhythm has changed in lasting ways since 2020. Foot traffic downtown has not returned, work patterns are different, and the economics of running urban cafés look very different than they did even a few years ago. Like many local restaurants and cafés, we reached a moment where we had to confront that reality honestly,” the post stated.",

    "title": "Despite getting flak for being woke and lazy, an exec at $62 billion giant Colgate says Gen Z workers are actually ‘pushing us to get better’",
    "description": "Sally Massey, the chief human resources officer at the $62 billion giant Colgate-Palmolive, is hitting back that young staffers aren’t the career sloths some typecast them to be.",
    "fullText": "Stereotypes stick, and some bosses have already made up their minds on Gen Z workers. Oscar-winning star Jodie Foster slammed the young staffers she encountered on the set of True Detective as “really annoying, especially in the workplace,” while fellow actress Whoopi Goldberg claimed that Gen Zers “only want to work four hours” yet expect to live in comfort.\n\nBut the chief human resources officer at $62 billion giant Colgate-Palmolive is hitting back that young staffers aren’t the career sloths some typecast them to be. Sally Massey credits Gen Z as being ambitious, and incredibly tech savvy—critical skills that the consumer products company behind Colgate toothpaste and Irish Spring soap is looking for in talent.\n\n“[Gen Z] have grown up with technology. They’ve grown up in a very different way than some of the other generations in the organization,” the CHRO tells Fortune.\n\n“They bring with them new ideas, new perspectives, curiosity,” Massey adds. “They’re pushing us to get better and to do things differently—I think it’s great.”\n\nMassey admits that Gen Z are bringing their own distinct “perspectives and expectations” to the workplace. And with 34,000 Colgate employees spread out among four generations, bridging the divide between age groups is especially daunting. So to ensure that everyone is working in harmony, the exec is revamping the usual chain of command; Colgate’s top leaders are hearing out entry-level staffers, stimulating the flow of ideas between ranks and generations to generate the best possible outcome.\n\n“We’re not siloed by generation or tenure, the senior leaders at Colgate want to hear ideas and thoughts from the more junior employees,” Massey says. “It’s how we get better, because as you get more senior, you can get further away. So it’s important for all of us to stay close, connected, and to learn from each other—regardless of the role.”\n\nMassey’s not alone. Not all employers have given up on hiring Gen Zers—despite headlines that suggest otherwise. In fact, many are still scoping out young talent with standout AI skills.\n\nEmily Glassberg Sands, Stripe’s head of data and AI, revealed she’s all-in on hiring recent graduates at the $91.5 billion financial services company. Just like Massey, she singled out Gen Z’s tech adaptability as one of the in-demand skills she’s looking for in Stripe employees.\n\n“I’m actually hiring more new grads—now, they’re largely new grad PhDs—but more new grads than ever before,” Glassberg Sands said on the Forward Future podcast last year. “Because they have the cutting edge skills, and they come in with fresh ideas, and they know how to think, and they know how to use the latest tools.”\n\nEven when young employees drive their bosses up the wall, CEOs are still embracing Gen Z as movers and shakers. Matt Huang, the cofounder of the $12 billion crypto investment firm Paradigm, is all too familiar with the temperament of young workers. The company’s first hire, then-19-year-old college dropout Charlie Noyes, once showed up five hours late to his first 10 a.m. meeting. The business has also embraced Gen Z-coded, unorthodox ways of choosing its top executives; Paradigm’s chief technology officer, Georgios Konstantopoulos, was discovered on a Discord server while he was still a teenager.\n\nHiring these innovative—albeit, sometimes finicky—Gen Zers may sound like a gamble for traditional workplaces. The Paradigm CEO admitted that the young staffers can come with drawbacks, but the value they generate is worth any havoc they wreak in the office.\n\n“They create an absurd amount of chaos sometimes and you want to pull your hair out,” Huang told Colossus Review last year. “But then you see what they can do and it’s like, holy crap. Nobody else in the world could do that.”\n\nEven the seasoned business experts teaching legions of Gen Z students are cutting in on criticism. Suzy Welch, a best-selling author and professor of management practice at New York University, hit back against those who brand the young generation lazy by reminiscing on her career journey. The baby boomer professor recalled having hope that she could one day be more successful than her parents—but for Gen Zers, that dream of prosperity is out of reach. Welch encouraged bosses to empathize with their unique job and economic vulnerabilities.\n\n“Gen Z [has] no reason to believe that they’re ever going to have economic security,” Welch said on a podcast last year. “I don’t know about you, but I’m old enough that when I was in college, I thought ‘For sure, I’m going to have more money than my parents.’ And that ‘If I work very very hard I’m going to buy a house someday,’ and this was the assumption.”\n\n“A lot of Gen Z [are] just saying ‘I’m not even sure we’re going to be alive in 20 years because of global warming,’” Welch continued. “And ‘The world is probably going to end anyway because of the stupidity of decisions your generations made.’”\n\nMillionaire podcaster and former CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins also came to Gen Z’s defense. In response to stereotypes that young people are anxious, addicted to social media, and lazy, she posed one question: “Have you stopped to consider what it’s like to be a twentysomething today?” Chances are if critics try and envision stepping into their shoes, they’ll be met with the harsh reality that Gen Zers are under immense stress and pressure that didn’t exist just five years ago.\n\n“The world is in chaos—and most twentysomethings had parents that lived in a very predictable, stable economy,” Robbins said in a TikTok video posted last year. “They went to a corporate job, they reported to the office, they had a network of friends at work. That’s not the typical 20-year-old experience.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "CNN’s Michael Smerconish couldn’t believe his eyes when reading a fan tweet live on air Saturday.\n\n“From [Rhode Island],” Smerconish began reading. “You are making it way too complicated. The rule should be, if you run from the police — What? Are you s***ting me?”\n\nHe continued, “If you run from the police, you’ll be shot. That should be the standard? Surely — Put that camera on me!”\n\nSmerconish repeated the tweet again.\n\n“Surely, you jest. Surely you — ‘If you run from the police, you’ll be shot,'” he said. “That’s the world in which you want to live?”\n\nSmerconish continued, “By the way, I’m a shoplifter. I’m a — I don’t know — a car thief, I’m a pickpocket artist, and the police happen upon the scene, and I run. And you want me shot without regard for any standard as to serious bodily harm or death being in play? No, that’s…there is a country for you and it’s behind an iron curtain. It’s probably a place where they would chop off your hand as well. That is nutty.”\n\nVice President JD Vance claimed on Thursday that the federal agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis mother Renee Good, was protected by “absolutely immunity.”\n\n“You have a federal law enforcement official engaging in federal law enforcement action — that’s a federal issue,” Vance said. “He is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job.”\n\nFederal agents do not, in fact, have absolute immunity. They have what’s called “Supremacy Clause immunity” that protects them from state criminal prosecution when they’re carrying out their official duties, provided their actions are “necessary and proper.”\n\nIt would be up to a court to determine whether ICE agent Jonathan Good’s actions met this standard when he shot Good multiple as she moved her vehicle after being instructed to exit.  Good’s last words to the agent were, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you.”\n\nA male voice can be heard on the scene calling her a “f**king bitch after shots were fired,” according to footage released to the public.\n\nThe Trump administration claimed that Good engaged in an act of “domestic terrorism” and hit Ross with her van.\n\nThe post ‘Are You Sh**ting Me?’ Smerconish Stunned By Viewer Saying ‘If You Run From The Police’ You’ll Be Shot first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nBurmese pythons achieved the near-total disappearance of 3 native species in the Florida Everglades.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons in the area.\n\n2005 field data counterintuitively confirm that a Burmese python can consume an entire American alligator.\n\nPythons utilize nest-raiding to win the battle before crocodiles ever reach the showdown.\n\nWho do you think would win a fight between a python and a crocodile in Florida?\n\nGenerally, we would look to real-life examples for clues, but surprisingly, there isn’t very much of that. While there are a few examples of pythons getting into it with alligators in Florida, they don’t seem to have many significant interactions with crocodiles.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we can’t wager a pretty good guess on our own, though. We can actually take a look at pythons and crocodiles in Florida and see who would emerge victorious in an encounter between them.\n\nThe Burmese python is not a native species in Florida. However, they are often found around the Everglades in South Florida. Native to Southeast Asia, Burmese pythons were first brought to the United States as exotic pets. Some pet owners ended up releasing the snakes into the wild, and the problem began.\n\nThe Burmese python is now considered to be a nuisance to the Everglades ecosystem, and for good reason. These pythons compete with native animals for food. They have also caused severe declines in many native species, including bobcats, opossums, and raccoons.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons.\n\nIn fact, they’ve even been known to eat alligators in some cases. In 2005, in the Florida Everglades, the body of a Burmese python was found with an American alligator in its stomach!\n\nThe American crocodile, or Crocodylus acutus, generally populate South Florida. This is the northern end of the crocodile’s range in most cases. They can be found in coves, ponds, and creeks in mangrove swamps, and they typically inhabit saltwater or brackish areas.\n\nFloridians will often see crocodiles basking in the sun. Because they’re ectothermic animals, they rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures.\n\nThey are the largest reptiles on earth and are said to be able to produce tears. They can’t chew their food, and to improve digestion, they have been known to swallow rocks. Crocodiles also have special hearts. Their hearts have four chambers just like humans do!\n\nShy and reclusive, they’re generally not a danger to people. If they’re approached by a person while basking in the sun, they’ll usually just quickly escape into the water.\n\nAmerican crocodiles typically eat small mammals, frogs, fish, turtles, and birds. Humans are the main threats to crocodiles because of habitat destruction and illegal hunting.\n\nCrocodile nests are also in danger due to predators, such as birds, crabs, and raccoons. In some cases, pythons will even eat alligator and crocodile eggs.\n\nPythons live in tropical areas of Asia and Africa. They can thrive in either wet or dry environments; however, they are freshwater and fully marine. They like it where it is hot and wet so their bodies can stay warm. They are usually found in rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, swamps, and shrubs.\n\nThese types of environments are home to many different creatures, such as the crocodile. That’s why these creatures are natural enemies because they share the same waters and wetlands.\n\nIf a Ball Python are able to survive adulthood, they can live about 10 to 15 years in the wild. However, the expected lifespan for a ball python living in captivity is around 30 years. Some, however, have been recorded to live over 50 years old when cared for properly.\n\nWhen predicting who would win in a battle between a python and a crocodile, we need to consider all of the factors. Knowledge of the physical features of both of these animals is very helpful in this process.\n\nPythons are often longer than crocodiles, reaching up to 26 feet long, while crocodiles usually aren’t more than 20 feet long. However, crocodiles do have the size advantage, as they tend to be much heavier. While a python is typically no more than about 200 pounds, a crocodile can be up to 2,000 pounds.\n\nCrocodiles have the size advantage over pythons.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles have the ability to stay submerged under water for stretches of time. However, crocodiles are much faster, being able to run up to about 25 miles per hour in some cases. Pythons only slither at about one mile per hour. Even if crocodiles can only run for short distances, they can easily catch up to a python in most cases.\n\nCrocodiles have the speed advantage over pythons.\n\nPythons do have the ability to use heat sensors and chemical receptors to stalk their prey. However, they typically have poor eyesight. Crocodiles have better eyesight and are able to see in the dark. They have strong senses of hearing and smell, as well as the ability to sense even subtle changes in pressure.\n\nCrocodiles have keener senses than pythons.\n\nPythons and crocodiles are both relatively large animals, although crocodiles are significantly larger. Pythons can camouflage themselves fairly effectively. Pythons and crocodiles both have the ability to submerge themselves underwater.\n\nIn terms of physical defenses, it’s a tie between pythons and crocodiles.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles are known for surprise attacks. Pythons have sharp teeth and the ability to constrict their prey with their bodies. Their bite is painful, but they’re not venomous, and it is not a strong enough bite to be fatal in most cases. Crocodiles, on the other hand, have the strongest bite ever seen in a living animal.\n\nGiven the vital stats of both competitors in this fight, we’d have to say that in an encounter between a python and a crocodile in Florida, the crocodile would probably be the winner.\n\nOf course, pythons are not completely powerless. If they’re able to get past a crocodile mother and eat crocodile eggs, they can prevent crocodiles from even getting to the fight in the first place.\n\nPythons can clearly hold their own, which is why they are so successful as an invasive species in Florida. But given the size and strength of the crocodile, it would likely be no contest between the two. Perhaps at some point, we’ll see evidence of crocodiles helping to control this invasive species.\n\nThe simple answer here is yes. The python lives in an aquatic type habitat and while swimming it is vulnerable to attack. This means that if a python is in the water, it is within perfect striking conditions for crocodiles. While younger snakes can be captured and eaten more easily by a crocodile of any size. The older python the larger it gets, so depending on the age of the snake the crocodile may not attack.\n\nThe post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "description": "The NFL Playoffs begin with six Wild Card games. We'll show you how to live stream every match-up online.",
    "fullText": "The NFL playoffs have arrived, and 12 teams will duke it out in Wild Card games for a shot at the Divisional round. We've gathered everything you need to know about where to watch NFL Wild Card games, including live streaming options.\n\nThe Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks earned first-round byes, but the other 12 teams to make it to the postseason will battle it out in one of six Wild Card games. The NFC will see Los Angeles Rams vs. Carolina Panthers, Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears, and San Francisco 49ers vs. Philadelphia Eagles showdowns. The AFC will feature Buffalo Bills vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Chargers vs. New England Patriots, and Houston Texans vs. Pittsburgh Steelers games.\n\nThe most notable omission in this year's postseason lineup is the Kansas City Chiefs, who haven't missed the playoffs in several years and made it all the way to the Super Bowl for five out of the six past seasons. The Chiefs faced a tricky couple of months and ultimately lost their star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, to a season-ending knee injury in mid-December.\n\nWhether the Eagles, the reigning champions, can go all the way again this year or whether there will be two fresh teams at Super Bowl LX remains to be seen. Keep reading to learn some of the best ways to tune into the Wild Card round, including global streaming options.\n\nThe NFL Wild Card games are spread across several networks and streaming services in the US, including Prime Video, CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN. Each network has its own streaming counterpart, which we'll dig into below, but if you're looking to watch every game (other than the streaming exclusive Prime Video match-up) in one place, then a live TV streaming service will be able to help you out.\n\nThe best live TV streaming service we've tested that carries CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN, in addition to other networks, is DirecTV. These channels are available in any of the streamer's Signature packages, but you can also find them in the DirecTV MySports genre pack. MySports carries around 20 popular sports channels and unlocks access to ESPN Unlimited. Local channels in genre packs sometimes vary by region, so it's a good idea to see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. MySports subscriptions cost $70 a month, while Signature plans start at $90 a month. DirecTV offers a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nDirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network.\n\nAs we mentioned above, the Packers vs. Bears game will be exclusive to Prime Video. Subscriptions start at $9 a month, but you also get Prime Video access with all Amazon Prime subscriptions, which cost $15 a month. New users can get a 30-day free trial.\n\nAmazon Prime Video is a capable, competitive streaming service that's more than just a Prime membership perk. You can also \n\nThe Bills vs. Jaguars game will be broadcast on CBS. Paramount Plus is CBS's streaming counterpart. The Premium tier ($13 a month) is typically needed to unlock CBS live streaming, but NFL games are also available with the Essential plans ($8 a month). New users can get a seven-day free trial.\n\nParamount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime.\n\nThe Chargers vs. Patriots game will air on NBC. Cord-cutters can live stream the game through Peacock. While you typically need Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month) to unlock NBC live streaming, you're able to watch NFL games with the Peacock Premium ($11 a month) tier.\n\nPeacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n\nThe Texans vs. Steelers game will air on both ESPN and ABC. ESPN's direct streaming counterpart is ESPN Unlimited, which costs $30 a month. While the cheaper ESPN Select tier unlocks some action, you'll need to opt for the Unlimited plan to watch this game.\n\nESPN Unlimited has everything from ESPN Plus, in addition to all that the ESPN linear networks have to offer.\n\nThe Rams vs. Panthers and 49ers vs. Eagles games will air on FOX. FOX's direct streaming counterpart is FOX One, which starts at $20 a month and comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nAll games will also be available through NFL Plus, where subscriptions start at $7 a month (or $15 a month for Premium). However, games are only available on mobile devices, like cell phones and tablets, so we recommend one of the above streaming services if you'd like to watch the games on a TV. There's also an opportunity to bundle NFL Plus Premium with ESPN Unlimited for $40 a month, a reduced rate compared to subscribing to each service separately.\n\nNFL fans in the UK and other regions can watch every game through DAZN's NFL Game Pass. Subscriptions prices vary by region and plan, but the streaming service will host the entirety of the NFL postseason, including the Super Bowl.\n\nDAZN is the home of NFL Game Pass International, the only service offering live and on-demand access to all NFL games in supported countries outside the United States and China.\n\nFootball fans don't need to worry about missing out on any of the action just because they're traveling away from home. Viewers can keep up with their usual websites and apps from anywhere with the help of a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs are easy-to-use tech tools that enable people to change their devices' virtual locations. This way, their usual services work from anywhere the same way they would back home. They're also strong ways to improve online security.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start, NordVPN is one of the best apps on the market. It's fast, user-friendly, and offers some solid security features. You can learn \n\nNordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs.\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

    "description": "I sent my husband and kids to visit family and spent the holidays alone, discovering how restorative intentional solitude can be.",
    "fullText": "When people asked me what I was doing for the holidays, I responded almost too giddily, \"I'm spending it alone.\" Their eyes narrowed, \"What?\"\n\nI told them I was sending my husband and the kids to his family in Massachusetts, and I'd stay back in Pennsylvania. All. By. Myself. I wouldn't have to answer to anyone or for anything. Not requests for snacks or one more backrub. I wouldn't have to sit rigid, wondering if one of my three kids was creeping out of a bed that wasn't theirs. Or defend my parenting style while my oldest yelled about how life wasn't fair and we must all really hate him, and why should he have to listen to anyone anyway.\n\nAfter a beat, every single mom (and a few dads) told me: \"I'm jealous. I want to do that. How did you swing that?\"\n\nThe decision to be alone during the holidays came slowly at first and then all at once. I'd hit a breaking point that most parents, especially moms, are all too familiar with. But the moment I toyed with the idea of staying back — in a quiet, clean, empty house — that was it. It was all I could think about.\n\nI broached the topic, gently, with my husband, who couldn't have been more supportive and emphatic. \"You should take a few days away!\" But I didn't want to be away. I wanted to be home alone. That was the key.\n\nAs the days ticked closer to The Big Departure, people asked me when Jeff and the kids were leaving. \"Wednesday, but I can't ask when, specifically,\" I'd laugh.\n\nI explained to the kids that I needed some alone time; I needed to take a break. They, who are 8, 5, and 3, were relatively unfazed. My middle, big-feeling daughter made me promise to call her every two minutes. I wanted them to know that it was OK for Mom (or Dad) to step away and be alone. It didn't mean I loved them any less. Something, something about distance making the heart grow fonder.\n\nMental health experts agree. Solitude can be a crucial form of self-care (unless it makes you truly uncomfortable to be totally alone). \"When you seek out intentional solitude, and the demands on your attention and focus melt away, it allows you to have a level of awareness that can support healing and growth,\" Emily Moriarty, M.Ed., a licensed professional counselor and director of clinical services at Reset Outdoors, told Business Insider.\n\nFinally, they were off. And I didn't know what to do with myself. Everything was weirdly quiet. Clean. Empty. I loved it. I had a couple of low-key plans over the next few days, but my goal was to savor the silence and the lack of a schedule.\n\nWhen 5 p.m. rolled around on the first night, I started making dinner while listening to music. I danced a little. I ate while reading a book. No one argued with me that they didn't like what was served. Cleanup was easy. I put my dishes away. I didn't need to sweep — I don't spill things on the floor.\n\nI turned my phone off; I didn't need an alarm. No one needed to reach me, and if they did, they could wait. Dad was more than capable. I slept in. I drank coffee on the couch in front of the fire in my pajamas. I forced myself to allow things to move slowly — something I have a hard time doing with or without kids.\n\n\"Solitude doesn't include sitting alone in an office working,\" Moriarty said. \"It has to be non-work, non-caregiving time.\"\n\nWhen it was time for the Big Holiday Meal, I thought I'd feel a little lonely. But I didn't, and that, I realized, was because this was my choice. I knew my family was enjoying themselves with relatives they don't often see and having a little vacation. And I knew that they'd all be home before I knew it.\n\nI'm sure that has more to do with the stark contrast of raising three kids, co-running a household, and having a (fairly successful) career, and four days of abrupt, near-total solitude. If I didn't have kids at all, I'm sure I wouldn't be bored at 7 p.m.\n\nPeople have since asked me if this will be my new holiday tradition. I did like it, maybe a bit too much, but it feels wrong to indefinitely celebrate the holidays without my kith and kin. Four days weren't enough to assuage Mom Guilt, apparently.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s southern Volgograd region, officials said Saturday, after Russia launched a powerful hypersonic missile along with drones and other weapons that disrupted Kyiv's power supply and heating.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties, Volgograd Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said Saturday it had struck the Zhutovskaya oil depot overnight. In a statement on Telegram, it said the depot is supplying fuel to Russian forces, adding that damage was being assessed.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nSaturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nStéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Friday's attacks “have resulted in significant civilian casualties and deprived millions of Ukrainians of essential services, including electricity, heating and water at a time of acute humanitarian need.”\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said heat supply would be fully restored in Kyiv by the end of Saturday.\n\nShe said areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River would gradually lift emergency blackouts and return to scheduled outages. But resuming power supply on the left bank, where Russian attacks were concentrated, is more complicated due to significant damage to the power grid, she added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down.\n\nSeparately, the Russian Defense Ministry said 59 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight over Russia and occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's military said that besides the oil depot in Volgograd, it had struck a drone storage facility belonging to a unit of Russia’s 19th Motor Rifle Division in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, as well as a drone command and control point near the eastern city of Pokrovsk.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "The commander summarized a recent, intense period of operations in an area where the proximity of Palestinian villages to Israeli communities complicates the challenges faced by the IDF.\n\nThe commander of the IDF’s Battalion 101 in the Paratroopers Brigade revealed the complexity involved in West Bank operations during an interview with Walla published on Friday.\n\nThe commander, referred to as Lt.-Col. R. summarized a recent, intense period of operations in an area where the proximity of Palestinian villages to Israeli communities is completely different from that faced by soldiers in Gaza or Lebanon.\n\nWhen asked what the greatest challenge for him in the sector was, he replied that “in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon, the sector boundaries are clear.”\n\n“You know what your vital assets are, you know what you need to defend, you know where the enemy is, and you know where you are,” he continued. “In the West Bank, how do you protect so many communities across such a large area?”\n\nHe added that as a battalion commander, he was responsible for a large sector of territory spanning 20 kilometers by 20 kilometers. “The nearest company commander from the battalion headquarters is 40 minutes away,” he said. “In Gaza, if your subordinate encounters terrorists, you’re with him within a minute. I was in many situations, and in the West Bank, it’s different. You have to protect many vital assets.”\n\nAccording to Lt.-Col. R., “it’s a challenge no less complex than attacking deep inside Lebanon.”\n\n“So how do you protect so many vital assets across such a large area? You need every force with you to conduct itself at the level of a battalion commander in the field. You have no other option - you must trust it. Think about the fact that even for a company commander, it can take 15 minutes to reach an incident in his sector.”\n\nOver the past two months, the battalion carried out four operations, during which two terrorists were killed, and 26 suspects involved in terrorist activity were arrested.\n\nIn addition, the battalion recently conducted an operation in which 40 wanted individuals were arrested overnight.\n\nIn another operation in the village of Kafr Aqab, Lt. Col. R. recounted that “an entire battalion walked four kilometers through the village. That demonstrated governance. It sent the message.”\n\nLt. Col. R. described another incident in which a terrorist attempted to carry out an attack in the settlement of Ateret. “The fighters were right near the entrance to the community. A patrol that rushed there within three minutes encountered the terrorist and killed him. Another terrorist tried to move up toward the farm - and he too was killed.”\n\nWhen asked how the West Bank sector looks now compared to past situations, and whether it is more or less volatile, Lt. Col. R. said that it is “not the West Bank [he] knew from the past.”\n\nElaborating on the changing atmosphere, he said that “entering the refugee camps of Balata, Askar, and Jenin today is not the same as it used to be. In the past, we would enter with large forces, and today, a force under the command of a squad leader or a platoon commander carries out arrests in the casbah of Nablus,” asserting that “today, the IDF has freedom of action.”",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMost lottery winners make a beeline for luxury real estate, buying up seven-bedroom mansions with koi ponds, glass walls, and garages that look like car museums. But one lucky Virginian with $155.6 million in their pocket decided to celebrate differently—with a lawn mower. Not just any lawn mower, either. A zero-turn riding mower. Call it humble. Call it hilarious. Either way, it's a far cry from the Hollywood Hills.\n\nThe anonymous winner of Virginia's largest-ever jackpot—a $348 million Mega Millions haul—walked into the state lottery office, cashed out with the lump sum, and made one wish known: they planned to mow their lawn in style. That's not exactly the plotline My Lottery Dream Home was built around. In fact, the entire HGTV show banks on winners going house-hunting for multimillion-dollar properties—mountaintop estates in Colorado, beachfront retreats in Florida, or swanky Texas compounds. Not pushin' a mower down the driveway.\n\nFor context, Edwin Castro, who won a record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot in California in 2022, spent a chunk of his cash on three mansions: a $25.5 million glass-box home in Hollywood Hills, a $4 million Zen-inspired retreat in Altadena, and a $47 million Bel Air estate complete with koi pond, naturally. That was all before he started stockpiling vintage Porsches. He may never touch a weed-whacker again.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' just opened a $0.85/share round — 10,000+ investors are already in.\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nBut this Virginia winner? They're bucking the cliché. And ironically, that low-key decision might be a smarter financial move than buying a $40 million mega-mansion with upkeep costs that chew through millions annually. Real estate is still a top-tier wealth-building tool—but owning it and living in it are two very different games.\n\nBut here's the twist: skipping the mansion might actually be the more financially sound move.\n\nHomeownership remains one of the most powerful ways to build wealth. According to the Federal Reserve's latest data, the median homeowner has 43 times more net worth than the median renter. That wealth gap isn't just about property value—it's also about stability, appreciation, and the ability to leverage equity.\n\nUnfortunately, homeownership has become a high-barrier dream for many. Mortgage rates are high, starter homes are scarce, and even modest properties come with hefty down payments, bidding wars, and monthly payments that rival luxury rents.",

McKee was booked into jail in Winnebago County in Illinois, shortly before noon local time. He will remain there until authorities extradite him back to Franklin County.\n\nIt's unclear if McKee has an attorney who can comment on his behalf.\n\nMonique Tepe, 39, and Spencer Tepe, 37, died on Dec. 30 after being found shot inside their home on the neighborhood in Weinland Park. The couple's two young children, both under the age of 5, were found physically unhurt inside the home.\n\nMore: Dentist's wife did not make tearful 911 call months before couple was found dead, police say\n\nColumbus homicide detectives identified McKee through neighborhood video surveillance, police alleged in court documents. They tracked the suspect \"to a vehicle which arrived just prior to the homicides and left shortly after.\" They found the vehicle in Rockford, Illinois, and found evidence that McKee had the vehicle before and after the killings.\n\nColumbus police have not publicly identified a potential motive in the couple's deaths.\n\nAround 9 a.m. on Dec. 30, coworkers of Spencer's from the dentistry office where he worked in Athens called Columbus police after Spencer did not show up for work and no one could reach Spencer or Monique by phone.\n\nAn officer went to do a well-being check but went to a home on Summit Street instead of the Tepe home, according to body camera footage released by Columbus police. About 40 minutes after that check, friends of the Tepes found them dead in their home.\n\nPolice have focused the investigation on the window of time between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on Dec. 30, which is when they believe the couple was killed. On Jan. 5, detectives released video from a security camera showing a person walking in an alley near the Tepes' home during that time frame, calling the person a \"person of interest.\"\n\nThe couple's fifth wedding anniversary would have been on Jan. 30.\n\n\"They were extraordinary people whose lives were filled with love, joy, and deep connection to others,\" the Tepe family told USA TODAY in a statement on Jan. 2.\n\nContributing: Melina Khan, Amanda Lee Myers\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Illinois man arrested for murder of ex-wife, Ohio dentist",

We've certainly done that,\" Parkinson said.\n\nThey did, and then some - beating top-flight opposition for the first time since 1999 to progress into round four.\n\nBut Wrexham are getting used to writing their own scripts.\n\n\"It's not just about the money, the fame and the people involved who have been amazing in the whole story, but to keep that edge and keep pushing as they're doing is tremendous,\" Dyche said.\n\nAnd, with a nod to Wrexham's position just outside the Championship play-offs, having been a non-league side as recently as 2023, he added: \"They might well add to the story.\"",

Ryan Elias found his target at the lineout and Macleod touched down from the maul.\n\nBut Pau once again silenced the sparse crowd with Tuipulotu crashing over and leaving his former side a mountain to climb.\n\nScarlets recovered from the disappointment of having a Henry Thomas try disallowed with another powerful maul, and there was no stopping Macleod once he got a sniff of a second.\n\nPau flanker Reece Hewat was shown a yellow card in the build-up, and with their tails up, Tom Rogers was quickest to pounce on a loose ball and chipped ahead for Hughes to win the foot race to the line.\n\nStill a man up after the break, Kemsley Mathias' outrageous step looked to have set up a try, but a TMO intervention showed the loose-head had been held up.\n\nScarlets kept coming and a powerful run by Plumtree broke the defensive line, and while he also looked to have been held up, the in-form flanker managed to wriggle free to ground the ball as Scarlets took the lead for the first time since the eighth minute.\n\nWith the crowd now behind them, Pau's discipline started to crumble and Hawkins finished off after the driving maul had done most of the damage.\n\nNathan Decron headed to the sin bin for an infringement, but Scarlets failed to take advantage as Pau demonstrated why they are currently the second best team in the Top 14.\n\nThey brought on their replacement forwards who made an instant impact, with prop Seneca taking advantage of some mis-communication in the defence to bust through.\n\nA careless Sam Lousi penalry gifted Pau a five metre lineout, with Attissogbe finding a gap to give his side the lead once more.\n\nFletcher Anderson looked to have come up with what could have been a winning try after Eddie James' pressure had won back possession, but the Scarlets number eight was stripped of the ball moments before grounding.\n\nLengthy replays added to the late drama, but Scarlets fans were left booing the final decision and it was Pau who finished with a flourish with well-taken tries from Attissogbe and Tokolahi.\n\nScarlets: Murray; Rogers, Roberts, James, Mee; Hawkins, Hughes; Mathias, Elias, Thomas, Lousi, Ball, Plumtree, Macleod (capt), Anderson.\n\nReplacements: Van der Merwe, Hepburn, O'Connor, Price, Davis, Blacker, Leggatt-Jones, Nicholas.\n\nPau: Attissogbe; Arfeuil, Decron, Valentino, Butlin; Desperes, Daubagna (capt); Etchebehere, Delhommel,Arrieta, Jolmes, Capelli, Zegueur, Hewat, Tuipulotu.\n\nReplacements: Rey, Seneca, Tokolahi, Liufau, Iosefo, Pelesasa, Robson, Mondinat.\n\nAssistants: Ian Kenny (Sco), Finlay Brown (Sco)\n\nSin bin: Hewat (34), Decron (50)",

    "fullText": "Tries: Ma'asi-White, Rodd, O'Flaherty 2 Cons: Ford 3\n\nTries: Tshituka Cons: Masuku Pens: Masuku\n\nA much-improved second-half performance helped Sale beat South African side the Sharks and confirmed their passage to the Investec Champions Cup last 16.\n\nSiya Masuku's penalty put the visitors ahead before Sale centre Rekeiti Ma'asi-White scored the only try of an error-strewn opening period to give the hosts a slender half-time advantage.\n\nEngland prop Bevan Rodd burrowed over on 49 minutes and Tom O'Flaherty crossed soon after to put Sale 19-3 up, before Sharks flanker Manu Tshituka scored a wonderful individual try to reduce the arrears.\n\nBut Sale hit back immediately and O'Flaherty's second score shortly after the hour mark secured the bonus point - and Alex Sanderson's men stood firm from that point on to ensure their opponents left with nothing.\n\nSaturday's Champions Cup live text and radio coverage\n\nBristol beat Bulls in astonishing 16-try contest\n\nAfter falling behind to Masuku's penalty Sale responded quickly and their building pressure told when Ma'asi-White collected a short pass before crossing the whitewash.\n\nSharks, without the majority of their South Africa internationals including captain Siya Kolisi, were enjoying plenty of possession and providing an attacking threat, but after several phases of probing the Sale defence around the 20-minute mark they opted to kick in behind and lost possession.\n\nSale debutant Obi Ene looked sharp on the wing but his side were struggling to build momentum with handling errors allowing the Sharks to counter regularly and on one such foray forward blind-side flanker Tino Mavesere came close to scoring but dropped the ball in contact five metres short of the tryline.\n\nThe hosts escaped again shortly before the break when full-back Hakeem Kunene broke clear only for Sale winger O'Flaherty to come back with a vital covering tackle.\n\nSharks fly-half Masuku tried his luck with a penalty from his own half early in the second period, and although it had the length he sent the kick wide of the posts.\n\nIt took Sale until the 49th minute to get their second try as a catch and drive from a five-metre line-out allowed Rodd to score.\n\nGeorge Ford's superb kick to the corner then set up Sale's third soon after. With the line-out ball secured, Ene spun it wide to fellow wing O'Flaherty who ran in unopposed.\n\nJust as Sale looked like they were well on top, Sharks flanker Tshituka scored an excellent try, picking the ball from the base of a ruck and beating Ford all ends up before racing away to the line.\n\nBut the hosts hit back immediately through O'Flaherty who secured the try bonus point on 61 minutes, with the five points ensuring Sale's qualification and leaving the Sharks reliant on other results to stay in the Champions Cup.\n\nSale face a tough game at Toulouse next Saturday (17:30 GMT) which is likely to determine whether they have a home or away tie in the last 16, while the Sharks finish the pool stage with a home fixture against bottom side Clermont earlier on the same day (13:00).\n\nSale: Carpenter; Ene, Du Preez, Ma'asi-White, O'Flaherty; Ford, Warr; Rodd, Jibulu, Harper, Bamber, Van Rhyn (capt), Vermeulen, Dugdale, T Curry.\n\nReplacements: Caine, McIntyre, John, Burrow, Andrews, Hanson, Louw, Wehr.\n\nSharks: Kunene; Penxe, Venter, Julius, Malan; Masuku, Braude; Mazibuko, Swart, Koch, Rahl, Van Heerden, Mavesere, Tshituka, Hatton (capt).\n\nReplacements: Bester, Ganyane, Mdanda, Tshituka, Romao, Everson, Smith, Potgieter.\n\nAssistant referees: Adam Jones (Wal) and Ben Connor (Wal)",

I think when the team plays like that it becomes easier for the individual, but Antoine is settling well.\n\n\"He is a humble guy and we have followed him for a long time, but he brings something to the frontline - what we really want and what we need.\n\n\"He can attack quick, he wants to chase, he is a guy who doesn't stop. I think you see today that he can adapt quite quickly to our style. It's nice to have him with us.\"",

    "fullText": "No matter who is appointed Manchester United caretaker manager until the end of the season, Darren Fletcher has emerged as one of the big winners from a week of turmoil at Old Trafford.\n\nFletcher stepped up from his day-to-day role as United's under-18s coach to replace Ruben Amorim for the games against Burnley and Brighton.\n\nThe former United and Scotland midfielder is adamant he has looked no further than that and is relaxed about what comes next.\n\nHowever, Fletcher has made a hugely positive impression on United's powerbrokers.\n\nIt maybe should not be a surprise because that is exactly what happened when he came back to the club in October 2020, and then joined Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first-team coaching set-up in January 2021.\n\n\"I was surprised I got offered the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand, so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all.\n\n\"But I know that I can do it and I'm comfortable doing it.\n\n\"I know the environment, and I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years I've been here.\n\n\"I've had great experiences as a player, took my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now.\"\n\nFletcher has done a variety of jobs since his return to Old Trafford. He initially coached the under-16s before Solskjaer called on him, believing his \"winning mentality, commitment and hard work\" would be valuable in the culture he was trying to create.\n\nOnly two months later he was appointed United's first technical director, underlining the impact he was making.\n\nA senior United figure at the time said that limited period proved to be a \"good advert\" for Fletcher, as officials gained a greater understanding of his \"intelligence\".\n\nThey saw first-hand what they felt were key elements - a hunger, tremendous work ethic and thirst for knowledge.\n\nThese were elements of the elusive DNA United had been searching for - and still are in the wake of Amorim's exit.",

    "description": "Liam Rosenior does not see a need for drastic change at Chelsea - and that was part of the reason he was brought in.",
    "fullText": "New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior says he did \"nothing tactical, nothing technical\" before his first match against Charlton - a sign of the likely direction of travel under his leadership.\n\nThat is not to say the 41-year-old lacks innovation or the ability to nullify opponents, but his similarities to predecessor Enzo Maresca mean he does not need to reinvent the wheel.\n\nWhen asked by BBC Sport why he had not made any noticeable tactical changes before Chelsea's 5-1 victory in the FA Cup third round, Rosenior said: \"This is a team that won the Club World Cup. That was five months ago. This is a team that won the Conference League last year. We're a good team.\n\n\"We are a good team. They've been well coached. I've made no secret of that.\"\n\nRosenior was appointed to build on Maresca's work, knowing the way Chelsea play, having been part of their multi-club model at French club Strasbourg.\n\nHowever, that is not to say there have been no changes. Chelsea have struggled to retain leads this season, dropping 15 points from winning positions in the Premier League, winning just one of their past nine league matches.\n\n\"No, I think the biggest thing I challenged the players on was our reactions to setbacks, our intensity. I was very happy with the togetherness and the spirit of the group today,\" Rosenior added.\n\n\"I was very happy with the intensity that they ran at – winning duels, winning headers, all of the basics. And that's where you get your joy from.\"\n\nSources involved in Rosenior's first sessions say intensity was a key theme, one of the principles he hammered home in his first media conference, and something that has, at times, been a failing for Chelsea during long spells of ponderous possession.\n\nThey have also been vulnerable at set-pieces and again conceded when Miles Leaburn made it 2-1 in the second half at The Valley, before running out comfortable winners.\n\n\"We need to improve in that aspect as well – long throws, wide free-kicks, corners going into our box. They are the basics that I talk about in football,\" Rosenior explained.\n\nIt appears the system and style of play is low on Rosenior's to-do list, with so many matches to come, and such little time to prepare.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur's belated show of spirit may keep the wolf from head coach Thomas Frank's door a little longer, but a damaging FA Cup defeat reaffirms the lingering belief his time in charge is only heading one way.\n\nIf there is scant consolation for Frank after Spurs slumped to a 2-1 third-round loss at home to Aston Villa, it is that the mood at the end was nowhere near as ugly as it threatened to be at half-time.\n\nDig beneath that and - barring a trip to Fantasyland in which Spurs win the Champions League - the rest of this season is now a quest for respectability, and for Frank, survival.\n\nSpurs supporters sent their team off at the interval with deafening jeers ringing in their ears after they were brushed aside by a vastly superior Villa, who established a fully deserved 2-0 advantage.\n\nSuch was the lack of hope that thousands of seats inside the vast Tottenham Hotspur Stadium remained empty for even longer than usual at the start of the second half, fans resigned to Spurs' fate after a dismal first 45 minutes in which they conceded goals to Emiliano Buendia and Morgan Rogers.\n\nIt was deeply uncomfortable for Frank, who not only felt the full fury of the Spurs fans he is failing to convince, but also the taunts of thousands of travelling Villa supporters revelling in his misery.\n\nAs well as the time-honoured \"You're getting sacked in the morning\", he heard chants of \"Thomas Frank is an Arsenal fan\" after he was inadvertently pictured drinking from a Gunners-branded coffee cup before the Premier League defeat at Bournemouth.\n\nHelped by complacency from Villa, who came out for the second half looking like their work was done, Spurs at least competed and poured forward, with Wilson Odobert's 54th-minute goal offering a lifeline.\n\nThe stadium threw its support behind their team, who finally posed a threat, although too often it was frenzied rather than composed when opportunities arose.",
