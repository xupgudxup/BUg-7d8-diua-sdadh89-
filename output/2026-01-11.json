    "description": "Here's everything Matt LaFleur had to say following the Packers' stunning loss to the Bears in the NFC Wild Card Round.",
    "fullText": "Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur answered questions from the media for around 12 minutes following his team's stunning collapse during Saturday's NFC Wild Card Round loss to the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field.\n\nThe Packers led 21-3 at halftime and 27-16 late in the fourth quarter and still found a way to lose.\n\nLaFleur's team lost five straight games to end the 2025 season. And he'll now head into the offseason with a contract negotiation and a big organization decision ahead.\n\nA few tidbits from LaFleur's post-game press conference:\n\n-- On the loss: \"This one is going to hurt for a really, really long time. When you're in complete control of a football game and script gets flipped in the second half...it was a lot of self-inflicted things. Give credit to them, we knew they were a team that could come back and fight, they proved it all season long. We had opportunities to put them away and didn't get it done.\"\n\n-- On what went wrong: \"A lot of bad things happened. A pivotal part was, offensively, we come out in the second half and could not get anything going...it was too many opportunities when you have the ball and not scoring.\" LaFleur said the Bears started bringing pressure in the second half and the Packers reacted poorly up front.\n\n-- On Caleb Williams: \"He's a great player. You can't give him that many opportunities...you have to find a way to put him away.\"\n\n-- On his future, does he expect to be back? \"With all due respect to your question, now is not the time for that. I'm just hurting for these guys. I can only think about what just happened. There will be time for that.\"\n\n-- On Jordan Love: \"I thought he played his ass off...we didn't do enough around him. I can't say enough great things about Jordan Love.\"\n\n-- On Brandon McManus: \"One of those kicks was a long kick at the end of the half, conditions were windy. But the difference was they made theirs and we did not.\"\n\n-- On delay of game after a timeout: \"That's a great question. That's inexcusable.\"\n\n-- Did he change how he called plays in the second half:\" No. They started bringing more pressure. So we went to more of our dropback protections...there were multiple occasions where it should have been picked up but wasn't.\"\n\n-- How to flip the script: \"We have to do a better job of keeping our composure....when you get in big games, when you don't execute simple fundamentals, it comes back to bite you. And that's exactly what happened.\"\n\n-- On what it means to be the Packers coach: \"It means everything to me. This is the greatest organization in the world, in my opinion. It's very humbling. And I'm disappointed for everybody that's associated with the Green Bay Packers. I'm disappointed for our locker room, our fans, our leadership, all our employees, everybody involved with the Packers.\"\n\n-- On the late timeouts: \"We wanted to get a good play that could pick up a chunk. We had an injury that burned some time. The timeout that really hurt us was when we make a substitution error and we have too many defensive players on the field. That stuff cannot happen.\"\n\n-- On the last play: \"I did not see what happened in the pocket. We were trying to get everybody in the end zone. He was going to spit it out to Rome to get 5-7 yards and get a little closer. When he dropped the ball, then it becomes the last play of the game. It's just chaos.\"\n\n-- On getting over the hump as an organization: \"It's going to take a lot of work because we're not where we want to be. I know we fought through a lot of adversity this year but unfortunately, we did not do enough to overcome that adversity. That's all of us, collectively. We have to do more, we have to be better. It's never an excuse. I know we lost some key players but you have to find a way to overcome that. I think we have a lot of talent on our team, it's just disappointing.:\n\nLIVE: Head Coach Matt LaFleur speaks to the media🎙️\n https://t.co/43qvL0A3Dt\n\n— Green Bay Packers (@packers) January 11, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: What Matt LaFleur had to say after Packers' stunning playoff collapse in Chicago",

    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears continue to prove that they like to hibernate, but they do not die. After having six comeback wins in the regular season, they capped off yet another one in their postseason matchup against the Green Bay Packers, winning 31-27 in a stunning comeback victory to advance to the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThings looked bleak early, as the Bears fell behind 21-3 in the first half after Jordan Love threw three touchdown passes. The Bears offense sputtered too many times and failed to convert on multiple fourth downs as faith in the defense was at an all-time low. Things looked bleak, but the team didn't lose hope.\n\nQuarterback Caleb Williams and the defense rallied in the second half to turn the momentum, scoring 28 points to storm back and retake the lead. Key passes to Colston Loveland, DJ Moore, and Rome Odunze kept drives alive as the Bears took control of the game from the Packers. After Williams found Moore for the go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, the Packers were unable to mount one more scoring drive.\n\nIt was the craziest comeback victory in a season full of them, and the NFL world took notice. Here is how social media reacted to the victory.\n\nTHE BOOGEYMAN IS DEAD \n\nTHE CURSE IS BROKEN \n\nBEN JOHNSON AND CALEB WILLIAMS JUST ENDED GREEN BAY’S SEASON IN YEAR ONE pic.twitter.com/7sjrEmk97D\n\n— Barstool Chicago (@barstoolchicago) January 11, 2026\n\n— Freezing Cold Takes (@OldTakesExposed) January 11, 2026\n\n— C.J.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIn his first playoff game, Caleb Williams showed why he's the Chicago Bears franchise quarterback. Williams led the Bears to a 31-27 comeback win over the Green Bay Packers, helping score 25 points in the fourth quarter along the way.\n\nAt first, it seemed like Williams' night was going to end in disappointment, as the Packers had full control of the contest. However, Williams turned it around in the fourth quarter, willing the Bears offense to an explosion of points.\n\nThe playoff win is not only Williams' first, it's also the Bears first in over 15 years. Williams becomes just the third Bears quarterback since 2000 to win a playoff game, joining Jay Cutler and Rex Grossman.\n\nAfter the game, Williams immediately celebrated by wearing the cheese-grater hat that Chicago popularized after their last win against Green Bay. He even grated cheese on the Prime Video set.\n\nCaleb Williams, DJ Moore, and Colston Loveland showed up on the postgame show wearing cheese grater hats\n\nwhile Caleb even started grating cheese after winning against the Packers pic.twitter.com/zlDxeB283I\n\n— Ahmed/The Ears/IG: BigBizTheGod 🇸🇴 (@big_business_) January 11, 2026\n\nFor the season, this marked the Bears' seventh come-from-behind win, the most in NFL history. Here's a breakdown of how Williams' shined on Saturday night.\n\nMORE: Matthew Golden scores first career TD in playoffs\n\nWilliams night began on a sour note, as he threw two interceptions before his first touchdown, but he came alive in the fourth quarter. Williams led the Packers to a fourth-quarter comeback, leading Chicago's offense to 25 points in the final 15 minutes.\n\nThe majority of Williams' highlights came in the fourth quarter as part of the huge comeback. Williams' best play on the night was perhaps a 4th-and-8 conversion on a play that the Bears needed to have.\n\nThe Bears had to have this first down.\n\nAnd they got it and more!\n\nGBvsCHI on Prime Video\nAlso streaming on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/zFAk3egnmE\n\nFrom that point on, Williams scored two touchdowns, one to get within three points and another to take the lead in the final minutes of the game.

    "title": "Jaylen Brown unloads on officials after receiving 0 free throws in loss to Spurs: 'Give me the fine'",
    "description": "The Celtics star didn't hold back on the refs after a frustrating game against the Spurs.",
    "fullText": "Jaylen Brown can expect a firmly worded letter from the NBA in his inbox over the next few days. He made very clear he is OK with that on Saturday.\n\nIn a battle between two teams near the top of their conference standings, Brown's Boston Celtics lost 100-95 to the San Antonio Spurs. Boston finished the game with a season-low four free throws, while the Spurs received 20 attempts.\n\nBrown had a productive but inefficient game with 27 points on 11-of-28 shooting (and zero free-throw attempts), plus 8 rebounds, 7 assists and 5 turnovers. After the game, he blasted the officiating crew of Curtis Blair, Nick Buchert and Jason Goldenberg while speaking to reporters:\n\n“I'll accept the fine at this point. I thought it was some bulls*** tonight. I think they're a good defensive team, but they ain't that damn good. I hope somebody can just pull up the clips, because it's the same s*** every time we play a good team. It's, like, they refuse to make a call, then they call touch fouls on the other end, and that's just extremely frustrating, bro.\n\n\"We play hard. We are outplaying our expectations, we compete hard on the defensive end and they reward the other team with touch fouls and we go down there and guys are allowed to get away with — somebody please pull it up. Every time we play a good team the inconsistency is crazy. I'll take the f***ing fine. Curtis, all them dudes, was terrible tonight. I don't care, they can fine me whatever they want.\"\n\nWhile we can't break down every call and non-call Brown has in mind, the data indicates he might have a point. As a team, the Celtics had received 4.4 fewer free-throw attempts than their opponent per game entering Saturday, the lowest mark in the NBA, while the Spurs are the second-highest at 4.7 more than their opponent per game (the Los Angeles Lakers are first at 4.8 more).\n\nWhat's more, if we are to take \"a good team\" to mean a team that has won at least 60% of its games this season, that free-throw margin becomes an incredible 10.7 fewer per game when including the Spurs game. In a Nov. 1 loss to the Houston Rockets, Houston received 28 more free-throw attempts than Boston.\n\nThis all comes with a disclaimer: equal free-throw attempts does not mean good officiating. Different styles of play on offense and defense lead to different foul rates. An offense that focuses on driving the ball is going to receive more free throws than one that attempts more 3-pointers. The Celtics could fall in the latter category, as they have the second-most 3-point attempts per game in the league.\n\nStill, the team at the bottom of pile in what is essentially a ref decision is never going to be happy, and Brown insisted that the allowed physicality was hurting his team:\n\n\"I'm irate at how they officiated the game today. If we can't get to the free throw line, and teams are allowed to be physical and bump us off our spots, it's hard to win games like that. We shot four free throws tonight and lost the game by four.\n\n\"Not to say that's the whole game, the whole story. We've got to be better in spots, I've got to be better in spots, but goddamn. I'm driving to the basket, I'm physical, I don't flop, I don't shy away from contact. I go up strong, I'm athletic, and nothing. I had zero free throws tonight. The inconsistency is f***ing crazy. Give me the fine.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time this season he's complained about the officiating.\n\nThe loss knocks the Celtics' record down to 24-14, placing them in a tie with the New York Knicks for the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. However they are officiated, they've still been one of the NBA's biggest surprises in a Jayson Tatum-less season.\n\nIn Tatum's absence, Brown is averaging a career-high 29.5 points per game and will almost certainly be suiting up at the NBA All-Star Game next month if healthy.",

    "fullText": "I’m pretty much non-verbal after watching the Green Bay Packers choke away a second straight game to the Chicago Bears (and they tried to do it three times). Here’s a quick rundown of the team’s snap counts. If I have something to say about it, it’s noted. No full breakdowns this week.\n\nThe offensive line was Rasheed Walker, Aaron Banks, Sean Rhyan, Anthony Belton and Jordan Morgan from left to right. Backup center Jacob Monk was injured on field goal protection, and starter Rhyan was injured in the fourth quarter, costing the Packers a 10-second runoff. Lecitus Smith played center for the last three plays of offense. Darian Kinnard’s two snaps came at tight end, one of which he caught his first pass of the season and fumbled.\n\nNick Niemann did not officially get a snap, but was the player in coverage who was scored on for the two-point conversion in the fourth quarter. The Bears played heavy personnel on that play, with extra offensive linemen and tight ends on the play. The Packers matched it with their goal-line defense, with extra linebackers, which put Niemann on the field following Edgerin Cooper’s injury. In normal defensive situations, Cooper was replaced by Isaiah McDuffie, the team’s usual third linebacker in 4-3 looks, who was backfilled by Ty’Ron Hopper.\n\nThe Packers finally used Keisean Nixon as their returner in this game, showing the world that their preferred returners, when the game is on the line, are Nixon and running back Josh Jacobs. This team is not trying in the return game in the regular season.\n\nAlso, Trevon Diggs only played one snap the entire game, defense or special teams.\n\nEvan Williams missed one snap and was replaced by Kitan Oladapo on the play.",

    "fullText": "Bowling Green, Ky. – The UTEP women’s basketball team fell 68–59 at Western Kentucky on Saturday afternoon at E. A. Diddle Arena. The Miners move to 9–6 overall and 1–3 in Conference USA play.\n\nUTEP battled throughout the night, showing resilience and keeping the game close at times, but Western Kentucky’s scoring runs proved decisive. Ivane Tensaie led the Miners with 16 points, while Ndack Mbengue added 9 points and a team-high 11 rebounds. Portia Adams contributed 7 points and 3 assists, and Delma Zita added 7 points and 2 steals.\n\n“I thought we played harder in today’s game,” head coach Keitha Adams said. “Lack of scoring in the first quarter is hurting us. We played them tougher in the second, third, and fourth quarters, but we have to find 40 minutes and get off to better starts.”\n\nWestern Kentucky set the tone early with a 13–1 run in the first six minutes, though UTEP responded late in the quarter. Tensaie and Tatiana Collazo each hit a 3-pointer, and Zita added a tip-in to narrow the gap. The Miners trailed 19–12 heading into the second quarter.\n\nUTEP came out aggressive in the second, forcing turnovers and generating transition opportunities. Brooklyn Terry and Adams fueled the offense, keeping the Miners within striking distance. Western Kentucky countered with timely 3-pointers and strong finishes inside, taking a 32–24 lead into halftime.\n\nThe Miners opened the third quarter with energy, as Samayoa-Mathis and Tensaie scored consecutive baskets to pull within one. Tensaie’s 3-pointer tied the game at 41 midway through the period. Despite the Miners’ push, Western Kentucky closed the quarter on a 9–0 run to take a 50–41 advantage into the fourth.\n\nUTEP fought to cut into the lead in the final quarter, with Tensaie and Adams hitting key buckets and Zita adding a layup to pull within single digits at 62–53. Western Kentucky maintained control, using fast-break points and timely 3-pointers to secure the 68–59 victory.\n\nThe Orange and Blue finished the game shooting 34.5 percent from the field, 32.0 percent from three, and 73.3 percent at the line, while adding 39 rebounds and forcing 12 turnovers.\n\nWKU was led by Salma Khedr with 18 points, while Trinity Rowe added 13 points. Caleigh-Rose West finished with 11 points and six rebounds.\n\nUTEP returns home for a two-game Conference USA homestand against Missouri State (Jan. 15) and FIU (Jan. 17).",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bears' playoff victory over the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night meant a little bit extra for the Bears.\n\nAnd that's not just us saying that, as head coach Ben Johnson said as much following his team's miraculous comeback win over Green Bay.\n\nAfter the game, Johnson revealed that the noise coming from the Packers before the contest gave the Bears a little extra fire to come away with a win.\n\n“There was probably a little bit more noise coming out of their building up north at the start of the week — which we heard loud and clear,\" Johnson said, according to ESPN's Kimberley A. Martin. \"Players and coaches alike. So this one meant something to us.”\n\nIt isn't clear exactly what Johnson is referencing as far as the noise at the start of the week is concerned, but we do know the two teams shared a confrontation at midfield prior to kickoff, although no fights occurred.\n\nThe Bears' win over the Packers was nothing short of incredible.\n\nChicago looked dead in the first half and trailed 21-3, which was the largest halftime deficit for a home playoff game in Bears franchise history.\n\nThe Bears also trailed 21-6 in the fourth quarter, making this the largest fourth-quarter deficit the Bears have overcome in a playoff game since 1933, when Chicago trailed the New York Giants by five points before winning the game.\n\nWe really shouldn't be all that surprised the Bears managed to claw their way back and win, as the team has been doing it all season long.\n\nNow, the Bears will wait to see who their opponent for the divisional round will be as the rest of Wild Card Weekend plays out.\n\nWhy LaFleur, Johnson shared unfriendly handshake after Packers-Bears\n\nT.J.

    "description": "Utah had several star efforts and showed incredible fight against the favored Cougars, though BYU wrapped it up late.",
    "fullText": "There was a packed house inside the Huntsman Center on Saturday night — a rarity these days, outside of when BYU comes to town.\n\nThat was the case again, as the No. 9 Cougars made the trek to Salt Lake City for the first of two rivalry games over the next two weeks — the two teams will play in Provo on Jan. 24.\n\nThe Runnin’ Utes, for their part, gave their fans plenty to cheer about against BYU.\n\nUtah played the Cougars even in the first half, fell behind by as many as 13 in the second and then rallied to within a possession, even down one, late in the game before BYU sealed the win in the final minute.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the game from the Utes’ perspective.\n\nIn the Utes’ first two Big 12 contests, they found themselves down 14-2 to No. 1 Arizona and 11-1 to Colorado.\n\nBefore all the fans had a chance to settle into their seats at the Huntsman Center Saturday, though, it was Utah who found itself with a nice early lead.\n\nTerrence Brown hit a couple buckets and a free throw, while James Okonkwo added a dunk, and the Utes were up 7-0 less than a minute and a half in.\n\nBYU recovered from that early spurt and took its first lead at 10-9, but it set the tone as the teams battled back and forth all night.\n\nWhat resulted was a highly entertaining matchup in which each team took its share of punches and delivered counterpunches.\n\nThough BYU used a 12-2 run early in the second half to go up as many as 13, Utah struck back and was within a possession multiple times down the stretch.\n\nThe Utes are still in search of playing a complete game, but rest assured, they made the Cougars play all 40 minutes Saturday night.\n\nCan Utah carry this kind of energy into games when non-rivals come to the Huntsman Center later this year?\n\nThe Cougars are well-known for their star trio of players: AJ Dybantsa, Rob Wright III and Richie Saunders.\n\nAnd understandably, those three led BYU to the win.\n\nBrown, even though he had a costly late turnover when the Utes had a chance to tie with under 10 seconds to play, elevated to the moment against the rivals.\n\nHe finished with a team-high 25 points and added five rebounds and three assists.\n\nDon McHenry added 21 points, two rebounds and two assists, and time and again, the dynamic guards came up with big shots.\n\nOkonkwo, too, brought energy inside for Utah, finishing with 13 rebounds, four points and two assists.\n\nThe Huntsman Center atmosphere has been a far cry from its former electric self, when Alex Jensen was a player at the U.\n\nEven in these lean crowd years, Utah fans have turned out for the BYU game, and that was the case late Saturday night.\n\nThe Utes fed off the crowd Saturday, from the first half when the two teams battled back and forth, to late in the game, when hope was still alive that Utah could pull the upset.\n\n(Don’t pay attention to the fact the MUSS held its sign up backwards at the start of the contest and at halftime — that was a bit embarrassing).\n\nBackwards flag😭😭😭 to be fair to them, it’s the first game they’ve been to all season pic.twitter.com/mWQCxmQF9i\n\n— The ROC (@byuROC) January 11, 2026\n\nPlaying in front of an electrified crowd was a reward for a group of Utah players who finally got to see what a full arena looks like.\n\nOnly Keanu Dawes was around and played when these teams faced each other in the Huntsman last year (Ibi Traore and Jerry Huang were there last year, too, but they never played).\n\nFor guys such as Brown, McHenry, Okonkwo and all the other newcomers, they got to experience the buzz here at least once this season.",

    "fullText": "MURFREESBORO, Tenn. – A midday affair from the Murphy Center saw NM State (6-10, 2-2 CUSA) match up with the Blue Raiders of Middle Tennessee (9-7, 4-0 CUSA). Offensive woes plagued the Aggies as they fell to the reigning regular-season conference champions, 88-51.\n\nThe home side scored first, though Lucía Yenes picked off a Blue Raider pass and finished in the lane for an easy basket, knotting the game at 2-2. However, an extended offensive drought saw the Aggies face a deficit of 16-3 with 4:19 in the opening stanza. Yenes would tally six first-quarter points, giving her 500 career points with the Crimson & White – the most among the 2025-26 roster. Notching seven 3-pointers, the first ten minutes ended with NM State trailing 28-9.\n\nAnna Csenyi knocked down the lone Aggie triple of the first half in the second quarter, posting five points in the opening 20 minutes of play. Outscored 21-10 in the stanza, NM State headed to halftime trailing by a score of 49-19.\n\nImani Warren tallied her first points of the contest to open the Aggie scoring in the second half, her seventh 3-pointer of the season. Morane Dossou collected a steal and finished at the rim on the next possession, giving the Aggies their best scoring stretch to that point in the contest. Emma Christiano and DeAvion Wilson each collected their first points in the frame, though the Aggies trailed 71-32 heading into the fourth.\n\nLucía Yenes and Senoj Jones paced the Aggies in fourth-quarter scoring, with the forwards each posting 11 points on Saturday afternoon. A trio of 3-pointers in the final frame helped NM State outscore the Blue Raiders 19-17, but ultimately the Crimson & White fell by a final score of 88-51.\n\nLucía Yenes finished with 11 points, her 12th game in double figures this season. The Madrid, Spain, native added nine rebounds, a trio of steals and one block.\n\nFreshman Senoj Jones posted a new personal best with 11 points, chipping in five boards, one block and one steal in just 16 minutes.\n\nAnna Csenyi finished with seven points, notching a triple in the second quarter against MTSU, continuing her run of at least one triple in six straight games, and nine of the past 10 contests.\n\nPosting five made 3-pointers on the afternoon, the Aggies tallied four or more makes from long range for the fifth time in the last seven games and the seventh time overall since Dec. 1.\n\nGoing 10-for-13 from the free-throw line as a team, this marked the second straight contest above 75% from the charity stripe.\n\nNM State tied a season-best with six blocks, with Imani Warren leading the way with two.\n\nThe Aggies recorded a season low in assists, dishing out just four helpers on 18 made field goals.\n\nFor the first time since Dec. 16, NM State failed to tally at least 10 steals (9). \n\nQUOTABLES\n\nEmma Christiano, on the team’s performance in Murfreesboro:“We pride ourselves on team defense to keep us in close games. Against experienced and disciplined teams like MTSU, it’s crucial that we find a rhythm on offense. We simply have to make shots if we want to compete at a high level. This game was a huge opportunity to learn and grow. I’m proud of the effort behind today’s game and that’s why this team is special, that is what we will always fall back on. I have full faith in my teammates and the coaching staff, this is just another step in our journey.”\n\nSenoj Jones, on the result in Tennessee: “Today’s game was definitely a test for us. There were plenty of lessons to be learned from and to better ourselves for the next game. This team isn’t a quit team, and I’m proud of us for staying in the fight. I’m thankful for amazing teammates who picked my head up on missed shots and opportunities.”        \n\nHead Coach Jody Adams, on Saturday’s contest: “I was impressed by their freshman, a very talented group that have the ability to play at the power four level. MTSU continues to propel itself forward with buy-in and commitment to this new era of NIL.”\n\nNM State returns next week for a pair of home contests, playing host to FIU on Thursday, Jan. 15, and conference newcomer Missouri State on Saturday, Jan. 17. Thursday’s meeting is scheduled to tip off at 6 p.m. MT from the Pan American Center, streaming live on ESPN+ with live stats available at nmstatesports.com/stats.",

    "description": "What a night in Chicago: the Bears won their first playoff game in 15 years and the Cubs made their biggest free-agent splash in a decade.",
    "fullText": "Simply, it was the greatest sports evening in Chicago since 2016.\n\nWhile the Chicago Bears were making arguably the greatest comeback in franchise history against the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night in the playoffs, the Chicago Cubs were making their biggest free-agent splash in a decade with a five-year, $175 million agreement with infielder Alex Bregman.\n\n“Big night for Chicago,’’ Scott Boras, Bregman’s agent, said in a text to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nSo, while the Bears were coming back from a 21-3 halftime deficit to win 31-27, Boras and the Cubs were actually in the middle of negotiations?\n\n“Bears game?’’ Boras texted USA TODAY Sports. “I was packing the green in for Breggy with the Cubs.’’\n\nThe Cubs, who tried to sign Bregman a year ago to a four-year, $115 million deal, got their man and stole him away from the Boston Red Sox with the richest salary in Cubs’ history.\n\nAnd after listening to critics all winter, saying that they haven’t made enough moves or spent enough money to make themselves World Series contenders − or at least better than the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central − they shelled out the big cash after acquiring Miami Marlins starter Edward Cabrera just three days ago.\n\nJust like that, the Cubs have got folks in Chicago believing it could be 2016 all over again, the year they won their first World Series since 1908.\n\nCertainly, Bregman, 31, is a huge winner. He opted out of the $80 million owed to him the next two years by the Boston Red Sox, and spun it into a franchise-record $35-million-a-year deal with a full no-trade clause and no opt-outs. The only Cubs’ contracts bigger in total value is Jason Heyward’s eight-year, $184 million contract and shortstop Dansby Swanson’s seven-year, $177 million contract.\n\nBregman, who turns 32 in March, will now earn $215 million over six years.\n\nJust like that, the Cubs could be a giant in the NL. They now have a wealth of depth in their infield in which they could either slide Matt Shaw to second base and trade Nico Hoerner or make Shaw a super utility player and keep Hoerner for one more year before he hits free agency.\n\nNo matter, the Cubs feel as if they’re set, and love Bregman’s leadership skills, as he has been in the playoffs every full year of his 10-year career.\n\nThis is why the Red Sox badly wanted to bring him back and were runner-up in the negotiations. The Arizona Diamondbacks also had interest in Bregman, but once they decided to retain All-Star second baseman Ketel Marte, they dropped out of the Bregman sweepstakes, leaving the Cubs and Red Sox as the two finalists.\n\nBregman, who hit .273 with an .821 OPS with 18 homers and 28 doubles last season, is the biggest free agent to sign this winter. Considering he’s two years older than Cody Bellinger, it perhaps illustrates why Bellinger has not accepted the Yankees’ five-year offer in excess of $150 million.\n\nBregman’s signing now leaves the Red Sox badly needing Bo Bichette, who also is being courted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays. Bichette has a zoom call meeting Monday with the Phillies.\n\nThe Cubs couldn’t care less what happens next. They believe they’re set now. They’re convinced they can win their first NL Central title in a full season since 2017.\n\nAnd, hey, with the Cubs’ convention scheduled this upcoming weekend, they not only plan to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of their World Series, but believe it could be a prelude to an October to remember in 2026.\n\nWhat a night in Chicago, with the Bears winning at Solider Fielder and the Cubs celebrating in their offices at Wrigley Field.\n\nWho would have imagined a brutally cold, blustery evening in Chicago could feel so beautiful?\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Alex Bregman signing with Cubs and Bears win make great Chicago night",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nUrban Meyer is fully sold on the Indiana Hoosiers, as they attempt to complete one of the greatest turnaround stories in college football history, let alone sports history period.\n\nThe Hoosiers put their stamp on a national title berth with a 56-22 Peach Bowl win Friday night, but former Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer sees a gradual step the Hoosiers can take if they were to beat the Hurricanes: an undeniable seat at the table of elite college football teams.\n\nMore: Transfer portal QB tracker 2026: Latest news on DJ Lagway, Dylan Raiola and others on the move\n\n“I’ve been saying it for two years, as well-coached as I’ve seen in my lifetime,” Meyer said on \"The Triple Option Podcast\". “Again, I’ve said this several times. I think it’s really important to re-emphasize. When you watch a team, and I always come in on Sunday and get ready to watch a team or get ready to play, some things stand out. I don’t watch, necessarily, the — hey, that’s a great touchdown pass. I wanna see how well coached they are, how tough they are.\"\n\nMeyer said throwing the metrics out is key when looking at Indiana, because skill for skill is the right approach.\n\nMore: Indiana vs. Miami National Championship tickets: How to buy, prices, seats and start time for 2026 CFP game\n\n\"They run the ball, but also the perimeter blocking out there. You never see what happened, like the pick six, where a guy misses a block or something happens. So, perimeter blocking. How about the running back steps up and hits a linebacker or safety coming from a 10-yard running start and the running back hits him right in the jaw,” Meyer said. “And Mendoza completes a pass. The route efficiency. There’s no wasted movement when the receivers run their routes. Those aren’t all five-star receivers; those aren’t first-rounders. Those are guys that are really, really good players that play great.\"\n\nThey will have a chance to showcase themselves once more against a Hurricanes team on a mission to continue shocking college football as they upset Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl before ending Ole Miss' season in the Fiesta Bowl to get to the title game themselves. They knocked off Texas A&M in the opening round in College Station.\n\nThe game is set for Monday, Jan. 19, in Miami Gardens, Fla., providing a fitting conclusion to an otherwise chaotic season.",

    "description": "Sunderland got back to winning ways with a 0-3 penalty shootout success, as Malc Dugdale reports",
    "fullText": "When the team was announced, I was surprised at its strength and the lack of rotation after the tired showing against Brentford, but once again, Régis Le Bris got it bang on and but for a dubious penalty, we would’ve won comfortably and the rested lads would’ve enjoyed even more of a recharge of their batteries.\n\nAs it was, we had to go to extra time and then a shootout to secure our place in today’s draw, but you have to admire the commitment of the gaffer.\n\nI would’ve been more than happy to put out a weaker side and indeed to go out if we had to, so we can truly focus on the Premier League, but Le Bris wants more and it’s standards like that which make him an even better coach than any of us expected when he was appointed.\n\nThe decisions he made could well have backfired but he committed to the decision and was once again proved right.\n\nPutting Luke O’Nien at centre back after so little football this season, for example, was a brave call.\n\nHe was up against a big strong striker in Beto and with himself and Nordi Mukiele playing as our central defensive duo for the first time, it could well have been something the opponents could exploit, but O’Nien did really well and I was really chuffed for the club skipper.\n\nWe couldn’t do as much with Mukiele’s long throws until Dan Ballard came onto the park, but the pair did really well and although it remains to be seen if he can play consistently at Premier League level, based on that showing, he did enough for me to continue to be a utility man on the pitch or on the bench, even with our international lads back.\n\nIn other areas of the pitch, the wisdom and bravery of Le Bris led to varied levels of success.\n\nRomaine Mundle got his first start for some time and while his go-forward effort was good, his end product was often either a loss of the ball or a shot which was easily blocked.\n\nFair play to the lad; as he stung the gloves of Jordan Pickford a couple of times and if you don’t shoot, you don’t score. This is maybe more indicative of Mundle needing more of a chance to get match fit and the accuracy will come, but whether he gets that chance remains to be seen, given most of the AFCON travellers will be back in the fold very soon — and many are already.\n\nIt could well be that the return of Bertrand Traoré and company could impact Simon Adingra more than Mundle, as for me he contributed less than Mundle by some distance — despite his recent goal and the chances he’s been given ahead of others after not being selected for his national side at AFCON.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if the matchday squad we use for Crystal Palace sees Adingra pushed down to the bench, and in some ways, the decision by his national side not to pick him may have been justified if they had more productive options to consider.\n\nUp front, Eliezer Mayenda took his chance pretty well too, although it was a shame that between himself, Brian Brobbey and Wilson Isidor, we didn’t manage to get a second goal to prevent the game going to penalties…but then we wouldn’t have had another showcase of just how good Robin Roefs is!\n\nWhen the penalty was awarded in normal time, he went the right way but was fairly beaten by a decent spot kick, although I’m not sure if the penalty would’ve been awarded if VAR was in operation.\n\nThe show he put on in the shootout though was the stuff of dreams, and will be a great base for him for any future shootouts we may need to progress in this competition.\n\nI discussed this with my father-in-law shortly after the game and even as a football fan in his mid eighties, he couldn’t recall a shootout when a goalkeeper has saved all three of the opponent’s penalties — with a 3-0 success the result.\n\nFor me, Roefs could be the best in the world at what he does. He has such talent at such a young age, and I say that without hesitation.\n\nWhat a goalkeeping performance, especially as he hardly had a save to make for 120 minutes before that, and if he becomes our record sale in the coming couple of years, I wouldn’t be surprised at all.\n\nMy final words are reserved for our little general: Enzo Le Fée.\n\nDespite his penalty going terribly wrong against Brentford — a real turning point in the game with the momentum going our way — he stepped up and took his spot kick with absolute accuracy and clinical skill, so well done for banishing the demons, Enzo.\n\nWe now move on to Crystal Palace — themselves out of the cup thanks to Macclesfield Town. That shows us all how these games can go, and I take back what I wrote before the third round started.\n\nLet’s give this competition a good run. You never know: we’ve quite enjoyed a trip to Wembley of late!",

Seemingly every BYU-Utah matchup at the Huntsman Center ends up being rather chaotic, but the Cougars were definitely to blame for some of the drama Saturday.\n\nBYU allowed the Runnin’ Utes to open the night on a 7-0 run, then let a 12-point second half lead to dwindle down to just a single point in less than seven minutes.\n\nThe Cougars shot just 6 of 26 from 3-point range, missed 10 free throws — including six in the second half — and gave up the most points of the season to an opponent not named UConn.\n\nWhile free throws were a struggle throughout the night, Richie Saunders knocked down two crucial ones in the final seconds to ice the victory.\n\nIt may have been ugly for BYU at times, but a win is a win, especially against a heated rival and in a venue that has too often been a haunted house for the Cougars in their history.\n\nThe “Brig 3″ was exceptional once again. Of BYU’s 89 points against Utah, 67 came from the superstar trio of Saunders, AJ Dybantsa and Rob Wright III.\n\nThe Salt Lake County native Saunders scored a team-high 24 points on 9 of 16 shooting, notching a double-double by grabbing 14 rebounds — eight coming on the offensive glass.\n\nRICHIE SAUNDERS vs Utah\n\n24 PTS | 14 REB | 3 AST | 1 STL pic.twitter.com/95Q5XTDAYQ\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 11, 2026\n\nDybantsa posted yet another 20-point outing — his ninth in a row — with six rebounds and four assists in what will be his last time playing in Salt Lake City until he suits up for or against the Utah Jazz a year from now.\n\nBYU'S AJ DYBANTSA WITH HIS 9TH-STRAIGHT GAME OF 20+ PTS 🔥 \n\nThe most in a row for a Big 12 freshman since Trae Young at Oklahoma 🤯 pic.twitter.com/lITOzAD6Jt\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 11, 2026\n\nWright added 23 points with six assists, scoring 15 points in the first half to keep the Cougars’ offense afloat early and scoring another six points in the final minutes of crunch time when some of his teammates had gone cold.\n\nROBERT WRIGHT III vs Utah\n\n23 PTS | 6 AST pic.twitter.com/xxJhzefln8\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 11, 2026\n\nAdditionally, Keba Keita scored 11 points with seven boards against his former team, adding a thunderous spiked block for good measure, and fifth starter Kennard Davis Jr. ended with eight points and two made 3-pointers.\n\nThat's a BAAAAAD man \n\n📺ESPN pic.twitter.com/xhWy9rDXIn\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 11, 2026\n\nBYU made history on the Hill. Prior to Saturday, not only had the Cougars failed to win at the Huntsman Center since 2021, but they’d only managed two total wins there since Jimmer Fredette graduated.\n\nFor as frustrating as Saturday’s action may have been at times for Cougar Nation, no one should complain about a road victory against Utah. They don’t grow on trees.\n\nThe win also marks BYU’s 12th in a row and secures the first-ever 3-0 Big 12 start for the Cougars as well.\n\nBYU shot 50% from the field against Utah and dished out 16 team assists. The Cougars, who led for more than 31 minutes of play, also won the battle down low with 46 paint points and a 41-33 rebounding margin.",

    "description": "Apple Wallet taking up 4GB on your iPhone? Here’s why it happens, what causes the storage spike, and how you can fix it safely.",
    "fullText": "We use the Wallet app without thinking too much about it. It holds our cards, tickets, and passes, and it usually stays out of the way. You check Settings > General > iPhone Storage and see something that makes no sense: Wallet shows nearly 4GB in Documents and Data. You delete your passes, remove cards, even delete and reinstall the app, but the number stays the same.\n\nIf you feel stuck, you are not alone. People have reported Wallet storage that looks wildly out of proportion to what the app does.\n\nWallet does more than store a few cards. It also holds local files tied to passes and payment features. That storage can add up, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nIn short, you did the right first steps. If Wallet still shows 4GB after a reinstall, you need to force iOS to rebuild whatever Wallet keeps locally.\n\nWork through these in order. You will usually get results before the last step.\n\n1) Restart your iPhone\nA restart sounds basic, but it can flush stuck indexing and temporary caches. After you restart, re-check iPhone Storage to see if Wallet drops.\n\n2) Update iOS, then check storage again\nIf you run an older build, update first. Storage bugs often ride along in iOS releases and Apple fixes them quietly. After the update finishes, give your phone a few minutes on Wi-Fi and power, then check Wallet storage again.\n\n3) Remove Wallet content the “full” way\nEven if you already deleted passes, do a clean sweep:\n\nThen restart again and re-check storage.\n\n4) Sign out of iCloud and sign back in\nThis step often forces iOS apps that sync data to rebuild local databases.\n\nThen check Wallet storage again.\n\n5) Back up, then reset as the “break glass” fix\nIf Wallet still sits at multiple gigabytes, treat it like a system-level storage bug. You see similar behavior in other Apple apps when their Documents and Data gets stuck, and the most reliable fix becomes a full reset after backup.\n\nThis takes longer, but it gives iOS a clean slate. In many “storage won’t clear” cases, it is the only step that truly resets the hidden cache.\n\nA big Wallet number does not automatically mean someone hacked you. People who never use Wallet still see some Wallet storage, and Apple Support forum threads show that small amounts can appear even when you do nothing with the app.\n\nThe issue here is scale. Gigabytes usually mean a stuck cache, a database that never compacts, or a system bug that keeps re-growing the same files.",

By targeting core digital infrastructure, our investments scale across many sectors and benefit a broad range of users. Improving the security, stability, and reusability of open software components directly enhances the productivity, competitive edge, and capacity for innovation of startups and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe open source ecosystem, while incredibly successful, is also increasingly fragile. Many more people are using the software than contributing to it. It is time to invest in digital commons, volunteer communities and the open source ecosystem to build the digital world we want to see. We are working to strengthen the self-determined use of digital technologies and systems by individuals, industry, and governments.\n\nTo prepare an application, we ask that you review and consider all information regarding the selection criteria and the subsequent process. Applications are accepted exclusively through our application platform.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide prior advice on whether a project generally falls under our objectives. If you would like to apply for support for a project, please first check thoroughly whether all the criteria listed below apply.\n\nSubmission through our application system: submissions must be completed through the online application portal. No supplemental materials should be sent via email or any other form of communication at this time.\n\nCompleteness: applications must be completed in German or English. The questions must be answered to a degree that allows us to assess and evaluate the applications.\n\nProposed activities: the activities listed in the application must be related to developing or maintaining open digital base technologies. Development is our primary focus, although security audits, conference attendance, and other community-based events can be included in the application should they be necessary.\n\nEstimated costs: The cost of the work described in the application must exceed €50,000 (current minimum).\n\nPublic financing: Projects are not eligible to receive financing or work commissions from the Sovereign Tech Fund if other public entities are already making or have made grants or investments for the same proposed activities.\n\nFOSS: all code and documentation to be supported must be licensed such that it may be freely reusable, changeable, and redistributable. OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre licenses are acceptable for code. Creative-Commons-like licenses for documentation may not include non-commercial or “no derivative” clauses.\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund invests in open digital base technologies that are vital to the development of other software or enable digital networking. We invest in projects that benefit and strengthen the open source ecosystem. Examples include libraries for programming languages, package managers, open implementations of communication protocols, administration tools for developers, digital encryption technologies, and more. We do not finance the development of prototypes. Our currently funded projects show the range and type of technologies that characterize open digital base technologies.\n\nWe are currently not looking for user-facing applications, such as messaging apps or file storage services. If this changes, we will announce it here.\n\nThese are the criteria we use to review all projects that fulfill the basic requirements:\n\nA technology is prevalent when it is widely used for or within other technologies.\n\nA technology is relevant if it is significant for one or more important societal sectors, e.g., education, health care, energy sector, industry.\n\nA technology is vulnerable if important work – to keep the quality of the project or to enhance it – is not (sufficiently) funded by other actors or cannot be completed for other structural reasons.\n\nThere are benefits for society or critical sectors of society (e.g., education, health care, energy, industry) by funding the technology.\n\nWe evaluate the work that is planned in the proposed project. For example, we examine the feasibility and overall impact of the activities described in the proposal.\n\nThe applicants, their organization, or community demonstrate that they have the necessary knowledge, insight, and technological skills to do the proposed work. They are either a recognized part of the community around the technology, or they have the endorsement of that community or the maintainer.\n\nLastly, the evaluation is guided by our strategy and mission. That is, from start to finish, we look at how the project fits into the Sovereign Tech Agency’s mission and contributes to the goal of sustainably strengthening the open source ecosystem in the public interest.\n\nCreate an account to submit an application. Please note that you will only receive a submission confirmation from us if you agreed to receive emails or SMS from us when you registered.

First, we check if the submission meets the basic requirements listed above. Those that do, are reviewed by the Sovereign Tech Fund using the criteria. You will hear from us whether your application passes those two stages.\n\nUpon positive review, a member of the program team gets in touch with the person or persons who submitted the application to scope the proposal in more detail. During this scoping phase, we work with you to clarify open questions, refine the scope of work, and create a project description, based on the application and conversations between you and the program manager.\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Agency then consults with a pool of external experts and practitioners and includes their perspectives to arrive at the final selection.\n\nThe last step includes a legal compliance review, the creation of additional supporting documentation, and the creation of a contract.\n\nFor technical problems, contact [email protected]\n\nWhen you submit an application, we’ll confirm that we have received it. Then, you can expect to hear back from us within 10 weeks. We’ll inform you whether the proposal has passed the review, and whether we’re continuing with you to the scoping phase. For some projects, the response time will be shorter, depending on the overall amount of applications to be reviewed.\n\nThe overall time between submitting an application and a potential start date of the contract is approximately 6 months.",

    "title": "Panoply of the Weird",
    "description": "Little known today, Fitz-James O’Brien deserves serious attention for developing some of science fiction’s most familiar tropes—among them microcosmic worlds, invisible monsters, time slips, and robots.",
    "fullText": "Back in the early 1930s Gilbert Seldes—a literary critic and early champion of popular culture—was asked to contribute an introduction to a volume of stories by Fitz-James O’Brien, now often regarded as the most original American writer of supernatural fiction between Edgar Allan Poe and Ambrose Bierce. At first Seldes declined, confessing that he’d never read anything by the man. But when the publisher jogged his memory, Seldes remembered that in some anthology or another he had in fact come across “The Diamond Lens,” O’Brien’s 1858 account of an obsessive microscopist who discovers an Eden-like world in a drop of water—and falls in love with the beautiful woman who lives in it.\n\nSeldes finally did introduce The Diamond Lens and Other Stories, published in 1932 as a limited edition with subtly sinister illustrations by Ferdinand Huszti Horvath. The book featured seven of O’Brien’s tales of the weird and grotesque, most notably “The Wondersmith,” which centers on a satanic toymaker whose miniature figures can be animated to kill the young children who play with them. According to Anthony Boucher, who reprinted the story in the December 1950 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, “almost the whole body of writing on robots is here in matrix.” That matrix, however, is one of melodramatic grisliness and horror in the style of the French Théâtre du Grand-Guignol. In one blood-drenched chapter, the inventor of these devil dolls tests their ferocity by setting them loose to massacre the caged birds in a pet store.\n\nO’Brien’s even better-known “What Was It?: A Mystery” describes a life-or-death struggle against an invisible and murderous humanoid entity. So popular was the story that the O’Brien scholar Jessica Amanda Salmonson found it represented in “over thirty anthologies between 1896 and 1964.”\n\nNevertheless, the Celtic Poe, as the Irish-born O’Brien has been called, is probably as little known today as he was in Seldes’s time. Yet he deserves serious attention, if only for establishing or promulgating some of science fiction’s most familiar tropes: microcosmic worlds, invisible monsters, time slips, robots. In one of his stories a fabricator of artificial eyes creates a portable surveillance camera in the form of an egg-size eyeball that transmits images to its creator. In another, O’Brien sets down the precise engineering specs for the construction of a gyroscope-like personal flying machine.\n\nWhile even his best stories tend to be structurally ramshackle and go on just a little too long, they always display O’Brien’s remarkably protean imagination. For example, “The Dragon-Fang Possessed by the Conjurer Piou-Lu” is a comic fantasy set in an ancient China that never was, one in which a tailor can be referred to as an “inventive closer of symmetrical seams.” Utterly surreal, the novella-length “From Hand to Mouth” takes place in the Hotel de Coup d’Oeil and features disembodied hands and ears, a talking bird, a heroine whose legs have been stolen, a mirror that acts as a clone generator, and an ancient guardian who, like Dante’s Bertran de Born, carries his head under his arm. The hotel’s owner is Count Goloptious, a kind of psychic vampire who slowly drains the residents of their creative vitality. For the most part this gothic comedy resembles a mix of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.\n\nIn fact, a considerable number of O’Brien’s stories should be viewed as absurdist fantasies. In “The Wonderful Adventures of Mr. Papplewick” the middle-aged protagonist finds himself accidentally transformed into a human magnet, just misses becoming a star exhibit in P.T. Barnum’s museum of grotesques, and ends up on an expedition to the North Pole, where he encounters a talking walrus. An amusing playlet, “The Gory Gnome,” neatly sends up the vogue for sentimental, romantic melodrama. Set in the Harz Mountains, it features a star-crossed couple described as the “despairing Lover” and the “Distressed Heroine.” In the opening scene of this five-page theatrical extravaganza—an active volcano plays an important role—Anna Matilda, the Distressed Heroine, enters “hurriedly, with disheveled hair, eating a sandwich,” which she quickly finishes before announcing to the audience that she’s been living on nothing but wild berries. Another story, “The Comet and I,” depicts an anthropomorphized comet taken on a tour of New York, not excluding the saloons. It’s the kind of jeu d’esprit long associated with Donald Barthelme.\n\nThe full panoply of Fitz-James O’Brien’s macabre fiction—horror stories, satires, weird tales, contes cruels—has now been assembled by the independent scholar John P. Irish in an exceptionally handsome three-volume edition comprising An Arabian Night-mare and Others (1848–1854), The Diamond Lens and Others (1855–1858), and What Was It? and Others (1858–1864). Irish’s introductory essay, which is spread out over the three volumes, provides a useful overview of O’Brien’s life and extended commentary on his major works, but also makes claims for the writer’s importance and influence that seem overzealous. No matter. Though endnotes explaining period slang and obscure allusions would have been helpful, this is the most complete edition of O’Brien’s supernatural writing now available, superseding that compiled by Salmonson in 1988.\n\nBoth Irish and Salmonson use the original magazine appearances of the stories for their copy text instead of relying on the sometimes slightly edited versions printed in William Winter’s pioneering 1881 volume, The Poems and Stories of Fitz-James O’Brien. However, we now know that Salmonson inadvertently made two misattributions: “Seeing the World” is actually an English version of a work by Vladimir Fedorovich Odoevsky, and “A Dead Secret” was written by George Augustus Sala. This confusion arose because much of O’Brien’s copious writing for periodicals appeared anonymously, as was then the common practice.\n\nMoreover, O’Brien was one of those prolific professional writers who could turn their hand to anything. Sensitive to the era’s penchant for tear-jerking sentimentality, he could produce “Duke Humphrey’s Dinner,” an O. Henry–like tale about a starving young couple who pretend to dine on imaginary delicacies and are rescued from death at almost the last moment. Alas, the two orphaned waifs and the organ grinder’s monkey in another of his tear-jerkers aren’t so lucky: all three freeze to death—on Christmas Eve.\n\nAs a magazine poet, O’Brien could turn out Keatsian lyrics, tragic ballads, or political satire. (A handful of the poems with an eerie or fantastic cast are included in Irish’s edition.) As a journalist, he produced reams of opinion essays—it’s been estimated that half of his three hundred or so known pieces of writing are devoted to political or economic matters—but he could also dash off lighthearted casuals, some under the rubric the Man About Town. His book and theater reviews blend insight with humor, always a winning combination. Though one of Herman Melville’s earliest admirers, he nonetheless suggested that the author of Typee and Mardi would be wise to adopt the familiar but elegant prose style of Joseph Addison rather than the baroque grandeur of Sir Thomas Browne. (Happily, Melville didn’t take this advice.) In judging a revival of his own popular comedy A Gentleman from Ireland, O’Brien spared neither the production nor his youthful self:\n\nThe dialogue is sometimes smart, but never witty, while occasionally it rises into the realm of fustian. The ending of the first act is weak and nonsensical. There is no characterization in it from beginning to end, and everybody talks like everybody else.\n\nThat’s scathingly (if half facetiously) dismissive, yet this transplanted Irishman’s savage indignation could sometimes match that of his countryman Jonathan Swift, particularly in the best of the early stories, “The King of Nodland and His Dwarf.” In Nodland, to sleep as many hours as possible is the whole aim and purpose of life. Given the resulting universal torpor, the Nodlanders maintain their somnolent lifestyle by enslaving members of the pastoral Cock-Crow people from a neighboring country. Meanwhile, Nodland’s government constantly replenishes its treasury—the money largely spent on frivolous luxuries for the king—by levying increasingly arcane taxes. Lord Incubus, the prime minister, reasons that “the more necessary a thing is…the more it ought to be taxed. Superfluities can be dispensed with, but if you want to be sure of a man’s money, tax something that he cannot possibly do without.”\n\nThis policy soon leads to a graduated impost on the number of hours a citizen spends asleep. Only the first four are tax-free. Unsurprisingly, a firebrand named Ivned soon calls for revolution, though he actually just craves total power for himself. “He possessed a certain species of vulgar, brazen eloquence, that was very effective with a particular class,” O’Brien writes.\n\nHis effrontery was dauntless, and his conscience, from systematic stretching, had become so large that it was capable of embracing any set of opinions from which the most profit was to be derived. He blustered largely about an article he called “patriotism,” but which in reality meant self-interest; he was, in short, one of those bold, bad men who was sufficiently elevated above his own low class to be regarded by them as a leader, but who was too far beneath any other to be looked on in the light of any thing but an unpleasant pest.\n\nAnything but an unpleasant pest himself, the easygoing O’Brien appears to have charmed every echelon of New York society. He was, however, cagey about his past. We now know—largely from the excellent 1944 biography by Francis Wolle—that he was born in Cork, either in 1826 or 1828, to a well-off Irish family. He later dissipated his inheritance during a two-year London spree, almost certainly resided in France for a time (he spoke excellent French), and immigrated to the United States in late 1851, possibly to escape the consequences of an affair with a married woman.\n\nIn New York, where he lived throughout the 1850s, O’Brien quickly joined the loose sodality of flaneurs and freelance writers who called themselves Bohemians. By his own definition, true Bohemians rejected bourgeois society to “cultivate literature and debts, and, heedless of the necessities, fondly pursue the luxuries.” In his later years, Thomas Bailey Aldrich—by then one of the country’s most popular poets—would recall “how hurt I was on an occasion when O’Brien borrowed $35.00 off me, to pay a pressing bill, and, instead of paying the bill, gave a little dinner at Delmonico’s to which he did not invite me!” This was typical.\n\nO’Brien consistently dressed as a well-to-do gentleman, was often broke, seldom had any long-fixed abode, frequently drank evenings away at Pfaff’s beer cellar (which Walt Whitman also frequented), regularly got into fistfights (in one he had his nose badly broken), enjoyed practical jokes, and could never maintain the self-discipline needed to hold down a steady job. Better to live by one’s wits as a hack, despite the pittance paid to contributors by even the best magazines, Harper’s Monthly and The Atlantic. As a result, O’Brien needed to write quickly and steadily. In a novel by William North, a character transparently modeled after him is called Fitzgammon O’Bouncer: “A professional critic, he wrote brilliantly but falsely. His imagination dominated his judgment, and worst crime of all, he was superficial—worse yet, consciously superficial.”\n\nThat’s an exquisite put-down, but it’s rivaled by O’Brien’s own self-mocking humor. In a piece titled “Walk Up, Ladies!” he offers himself as the grand prize in a lottery sponsored by an (imaginary) association of eligible bachelors. He naturally catalogs the rare qualities he brings to this signal honor:\n\nI am…of medium height, while in my figure, symmetry and strength are harmoniously mingled. My nose and forehead form the Phidian line. My hands and feet are small and aristocratically shaped, and my eyes by turns melt with the soft emotions of the heart, or flash with the nobler passions of the hero. My hair is chestnut, and flows in long ringlets over my neck, somewhat like the hair of the Apollo Belvidere…. Words fail me in endeavoring to describe my whiskers and mustache. I have been informed by the most excellent female judges that even in their dreams they never imagined any thing more lovely. My accomplishments are varied.\n\nAfter the Civil War broke out in 1861, O’Brien could add “courage” to the list of his virtues. Proudly American and a staunch Unionist, he immediately enlisted and all too soon was shot during a kind of impromptu duel with a Confederate officer. After much suffering, Fitz-James O’Brien died in 1862 at the age of thirty-five.\n\nWhile O’Brien’s prose usually reflects the easy efficiency of the born journalist, one still pauses over his flair for striking phrases and bizarrely surreal imagery. A shark is likened to “the thin blade of a sharp knife, cutting through the water with a slow, even, deadly motion.” Perfect. But to describe a winter storm, he writes, “The large flakes fell sleepily through the dim blue air, like soft white birds that had been stricken with cold in the upper skies, and were sinking benumbed to earth.” (Hmm, cloudy with a chance of chickens?) I particularly love the title he originally proposed for a collection of his stories, “Flotsam and Jetsam—Things Lost by Shipwreck, or Thrown Overboard to Save the Vessel.”\n\nAs it happens, there was no collection of O’Brien’s work until 1881—nearly twenty years after his death—when his friend William Winter brought out The Poems and Stories of Fitz-James O’Brien. Following a section of reminiscences from now forgotten literati of the time, it reprinted over a hundred pages of O’Brien’s poetry and thirteen stories. In general, Winter emphasized the darker, more disturbing fiction.\n\nIn Studies in Classic American Literature, D.H. Lawrence counseled readers to “look through the surface of American art, and see the inner diabolism of the symbolic meaning.” In O’Brien’s case, the diabolism is often right on the surface. In one harrowing conte cruel, a loving wife and mother gradually becomes strangely moody, then one night tries to murder her husband as he sleeps. Why? he asks. “‘I was weary of you,’ she answered, in a cold even voice—a voice so level that it seemed to be spoken on ruled lines, ‘that is my reason.’”\n\nIn “The Lost Room” a man residing in a labyrinthine apartment building discovers that his room may exist in two (or more) dimensions. When he opens its door one evening he surprises guests dressed in eighteenth-century finery trading quips at an elegant dinner party. When he insists that these interlopers leave his room, one of them smugly asks the epistemological question, “How know you that it is your room?” The narrator has already heard rumors that some of the building’s inhabitants are cannibals or demons. Could these be they? Or might they be insidious enchanters? All his own belongings have vanished, but in their stead he glimpses expensive, more sophisticated versions of the originals:\n\nWherever my eyes turned they missed familiar objects, yet encountered strange representatives. Still in all the substitutes there seemed to me a reminiscence of what they replaced…. There lingered around them the atmosphere of what they once had been.\n\nAt the end of the story, the room disappears entirely, leaving only a blank wall.\n\nAgain and again, O’Brien likes to embed his reader inside a protagonist’s disordered mind, as in “The Hasheesh Eater,” or reveal the existential vertigo that results when the universe no longer makes sense, as in “Mother of Pearl.” In “Uncle and Nephew” the eponymous characters flip-flop between which of them is sane, which insane. Even O’Brien’s most gothicky tales eschew the then-typical gothic setting: instead of gloomy castles or the decaying House of Usher, he sets the action in cheap rooming houses in contemporary New York. You could actually visit the sites of the events he chronicles. We are told that the building in “What Was It?” is located on 26th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues; a note informs readers that they can soon see a plaster cast of the invisible monster’s head at a local museum.\n\nSuch localization, leisurely set forth, lulls the reader with its comforting familiarity—and only then does O’Brien introduce the ominous thing, the unsettling anomaly. To use Freud’s terminology, the heimlich (homey) suddenly grows unheimlich (uncanny). In some instances, the horrific or bizarre events turn out to have been only nightmares, drug-induced visions, or monomaniacal frenzies. This sort of bathetic letdown mars—some would say ruins—several otherwise terrifying shockers. As a writer, O’Brien regularly has trouble with plotting and especially with closure, which explains why so many of his works end abruptly or exist only as fragments.\n\nOne reason “The Diamond Lens” remains particularly admired lies in its being susceptible to varying interpretations. Consider no more than its first half. In the story’s opening pages the narrator, Linley, recounts his childhood obsession with microscopy, which began with the gift of a simple microscope from a distant cousin. As he recalls,\n\nI comprehended then for the first time the “Arabian Nights’ Entertainments.” The dull veil of ordinary existence that hung across the world seemed suddenly to roll away, and to lay bare a land of enchantments.\n\nTo satisfy the wishes of his family, he agrees to enroll in medical school, but never sets foot in a classroom or laboratory. Instead he expends all his resources in acquiring every possible instrument or accessory needed for advanced microscopic research.\n\nAlready in this set-up, O’Brien hints at two ways to understand what follows: we can believe the narrator utterly, or we can conclude that monomania has left him “enchanted,” that is, delusional. Most readers take the story as “real,” despite the implication of a statement such as this:\n\nIt was I who resolved the singular problem of rotation in the cells and hairs of plants into ciliary attraction, in spite of the assertions of Mr. Wenham and others, that my explanation was the result of an optical illusion.\n\nOf his later research Linley admits that\n\nlike all active microscopists, I gave my imagination full play. Indeed, it is a common complaint against many such, that they supply the defects of their instruments with the creations of their brains.\n\nAt this point, O’Brien presents Jules Simon, an urbane fellow tenant of Linley’s building who regularly persuades him to buy unneeded and overpriced knickknacks. The source of these supposed treasures is kept deliberately vague. As Linley says, “I came at length to the conclusion that this peddling was but a mask to cover some greater object.” What might that object be? One evening Simon mentions, with unusual enthusiasm, the séances of the spiritualist Madame Vulpes. She can reveal “the most astonishing things in the world.”\n\nAlmost immediately, Linley wonders whether she can help reveal astonishing things in the microscopic world. At their meeting, Madame Vulpes summons the spirit of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who tells his fellow microscopist that fame will be his if he creates a super-lens out of a 140-carat diamond. Totally disheartened, Linley realizes that such huge diamonds exist only in “the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs.”\n\nAfter returning home, Linley visits Simon, who is closely examining something that he quickly hides away. The normally self-possessed sophisticate behaves oddly, appearing nervous and jittery for no apparent reason. To “probe the mystery to the bottom,” Linley gets Simon drunk, then tricks him by saying he already knows his secret, so why hide it any longer? Reluctantly, or so it would seem, Simon shows him a large and lustrous diamond: “I could just gather from his drunken statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence was affected) that he had been superintending a gang of slaves engaged in diamond-washing in Brazil” and one day absconded with the stone and fled to New York. If this is true, why is Simon’s incoherence “affected”? Needless to say, the diamond, which he calls “The Eye of Morning,” weighs exactly 140 carats. “Here was an amazing coincidence. The hand of Destiny seemed in it.”\n\nI’ll stop there, except to add that Linley does create his diamond lens from the Eye of Morning, and it reveals a fresh, paradisical world in a droplet of water, one inhabited by a lovely human female. Unknowingly, Animula, as he calls her, becomes the adored object of his almost mystical ecstasies: “My whole life was absorbed in contemplation as rapt as that of any of the Romish saints.” Growing ever more hopelessly in thrall to his microscopic beloved, Linley berates himself that what he feels “is at best but a fantasy. Your imagination has bestowed on Animula charms which in reality she does not possess.” As a test, he visits a theater to see a celebrated dancer, said to be the most beautiful woman in the world. He finds her almost repulsive compared with the sylphlike perfection of his Animula. While there’s much more to the story, you can probably guess what will eventually happen.\n\nAt the story’s very end, Linley—like some character out of Poe—confesses that “They say now that I am mad; but they are mistaken.” Are they? O’Brien leaves this an open question. Perhaps Linley did see into another world, but enough clues have been planted to suggest that he might have been imagining everything. I suspect that O’Brien intended this ambiguity. As with Henry James’s “The Turn of the Screw,” we ask ourselves: What is real? Everything or nothing? How much is the product of an unstable imagination?\n\n“The Diamond Lens” might even incorporate an additional turn of the screw: Could Linley have been the dupe in a scam cooked up by Madame Vulpes and Jules Simon? It does seem that he has been subtly manipulated, first to consult the spiritualist, then to learn—so fortuitously—of a diamond weighing precisely 140 carats in the unlikely possession of his fellow tenant. Simon and Vulpes probably counted on Linley to pay whatever it took to acquire the gem, which was doubtless a fake of some sort. Alas, the con artists misjudged the ends to which the fanatical microscopist would go to further his research.\n\nH.L. Mencken once noted that Fitz-James O’Brien was the only significant artist to die in the Civil War. His best works really are significant, too, despite their shaky plotting and occasional smudges of mid-nineteenth-century melodrama. This “fabulous fantast,” as Sam Moskowitz called him in Explorers of the Infinite (1963), remains a crucial figure in American literature’s dominant fictional mode, which isn’t the novel but rather the romance. O’Brien’s stories can’t match the concentrated visionary power of Poe, the Calvinist moral intensity of Hawthorne, or the grim ironies of Bierce, but the best of them do come close. Yes, he is just a minor writer. But aren’t minor writers sometimes the ones we love the most?\n\nMichael Dirda is a Pulitzer Prize–winning critic for The Washington Post and the author of several collections of essays, including Classics for Pleasure and Browsings: A Year of Reading, Collecting, and Living with Books.

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. ― Sun Tzu, the Art of War\n\nI think I’m somewhere between 2) and 3) in Sun Tzu’s taxonomy.\n\nIntermittently, for years, the Ghost blog you’re reading has been barraged by attacks. There are the usual script-kiddies and vulnerability scanners looking for SQL dumps and /wp-admin (hah!). But these haven’t been a problem.\n\nThe problem has been the spam signups, which never confirm, yet hurt our email sending reputation.\n\nSomebody is “subscribing” these addresses. Since they never confirm, they never get the newsletter. But they still get the confirm your subscription email!\n\nAnd they never signed up for it, so they don’t know who these “Autodidacts” are, and a tiny percentage marks it as spam.\n\nOne time, I didn’t catch it in time, got two or three spam complaints from ~800 “subscribes”, and Postmark (our SMTP provider for transactional mail) paused all sending. Fortunately, Postmark support was understanding. But it was a huge headache.\n\nIt also hurts our sending reputation, since transactional mail comes from the same address as our newsletter. Not good!\n\nThese are the hypotheses I’ve come up with so far:\n\nIf you have a theory about the spammer’s aims, please let me know in the comments. Mitigation tips also welcome.\n\nFirst, I put the site behind Cloudflare, even though I didn’t want to. Then I moved to an Nginx reverse proxy.\n\nI blocked the bad user agents. This lasted for a while.\n\nI took a shot at setting up fail2ban, but it’s a bit tricky because of the weird stack the site runs (Unofficial Ghost Alpine Docker image, but not actually running in Docker, running in Firecracker VMs on Fly.io, behind an Nginx reverse proxy).\n\nGhost added an integrity token requirement to the endpoint, but that didn’t fix it. They also added domain-level signup blocking, but since there’s no consistent email domain, it doesn’t help in this case. And there's already a honeypot hidden form in the portal, but they aren't going through the portal as far as I can tell.\n\nCurrently, I have moved the endpoint, since I suspect the attack is a generic Ghost blog drive-by scan-and-spam campaign. Some of the bad requests had InboxReads as the referrer, which makes me think the spammer might be scraping blog directories to compile their list of targets.\n\nIf the bots find the moved endpoint, I’ll have to add a captcha, which Ghost has considered adding, or put the site behind Anubis.\n\nI feel like the king of a very small city with a very large army surrounding it.",

    "title": "Jupyter Agents: training LLMs to reason with notebooks",
    "description": "We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.",
    "fullText": "A natural way to display multi-step code execution together with reasoning is within a Jupyter Notebook, which consists of code and markdown cells. So we built Jupyter Agent to act as an agent that can execute code directly inside a Jupyter notebook and use this environment to solve data analysis and data science tasks. Think of it like Cursor, but living natively inside your data science workflow.\nWe built a demo of this vision with Qwen-3 Coder, currently one of the strongest coding models. This is a follow-up to our earlier work on jupyter-agent (v1).\n\nWhile large models are starting to show useful behavior, the key question is how we can continue improving them. To this end, we focus on strengthening smaller models to perform well on agentic data science tasks as they currently struggle to compete with the large models.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a pipeline to first generate high-quality training data, then fine-tune an existing small model, and finally evaluate whether the model's performance improves on relevant benchmarks.\n\nLet’s begin with the last step: selecting a strong benchmark for evaluating models on data science tasks.\n\nIn order to understand if we are making progress towards better data science agents we need a benchmark to measure such capabilities. Last year, in partnership with Adyen, we introduced the DABStep benchmark: a way to evaluate data science agents on realistic tasks. The setup is simple: provide the LLM with datasets and ask it to answer non-trivial data questions.\n\nThis benchmark remains challenging for today’s LLMs — e.g. the best out-of-the-box model is Claude 4 Sonnet which reaches not even 20% accuracy on the hard tasks.\nYou can explore the live leaderboard here.\n\nNow that we identified a good benchmark we can try to climb it! We set out to build a dataset for fine-tuning such that even a small data agent model could perform well on DABStep.\n\nOur first choice was Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507: extremely small (fast to iterate with, easy to run), yet strong enough to act in agentic scenarios.\n\nNot great — but a promising starting point, since it left a lot of room for improvement. Let's see how we can improve it!\n\nA core aspect of agents that sets it apart from a pure chat model is the scaffolding built around the model to steer its behaviour. The evaluation script in DABStep for example uses smolagents to execute code. Smolagents comes with predefined behaviors, prompting structures, and expected formats.\n\nWe also studied the Qwen-Agent codebase, where the authors tailoring scaffolding to the model. This makes sense: Claude Code, for example, works shockingly well with Claude Sonnet because their scaffolding is aligned.\n\nSo, we restructured our scaffolding:\n\n👉 Check it out here: utils.py.\n\nResults: accuracy jumped from 44.4% → 59.7% (easy split). 🚀\n\nWith simplified scaffolding in place, we focused on fine-tuning Qwen3-4B for data science agentic tasks.\n\nThe recipe to improve a model on a certain task or behaviour is to train it on data that reflects the tasks as closely as possible. A natural starting point is to look at real Jupyter Notebooks and find notebooks that align closely with the task that we plan to tackle, namely data analysis.\n\nKaggle notebooks offer a wealth of high quality data analysis notebooks and are made available by Kaggle:\n\nNow that we have good results with a base model it's time to build a dataset that will help us improve it even further. We designed a multi-stage pipeline using Datatrove to clean and prepare Kaggle notebooks at scale.\n\nWe started with ~2TB of Kaggle notebooks and reduced it to ~250GB reusing our work from the BigCode project. As part of the StarCoder2 training data processing the notebooks (without output cells) were already deduplicated.\nMost Kaggle notebooks are small variations or near-identical copies, so this step was essential.\nKey insight: ~90% of raw notebooks are duplicates, which would have skewed training if left unfiltered.\n\nMost Kaggle notebooks reference external datasets via Kaggle metadata. To make sure the code inside notebooks could actually run, we built a pipeline that automatically fetched these linked datasets. This step was crucial, since many notebooks would otherwise be incomplete or non-executable.\n\nUsing the kagglehub package, we downloaded thousands of datasets — about 5TB in total. To keep things manageable and relevant:\n\nWe scored notebooks based on educational quality using Qwen3-32B. We saw that using the whole notebook was not optimal, as many contained trivial or broken code. Our educational scoring approach is detailed in edu_scoring.py.\n\nTL;DR: We assigned each notebook a score from 1–5 based on clarity, completeness, and educational value, and kept only those above a chosen threshold. This filtering removed about 70% of the notebooks.\n\nThis is similar to the insight from the BeyondWeb paper, which showed that using high-quality data is better for synthetic data generation — a step we relied on for QA (Question-Answer) generation.\nThis helped the model learn from “high quality” notebooks instead of noisy ones.\n\nWe excluded notebooks about training LLMs or unrelated to data analysis.\nWe also removed notebooks that didn’t actually use datasets through an automated LLM-based filtering process using Qwen3-32B. The implementation of filtering can be found in extract_packages_and_files.py.\n\nTL;DR: We prompted Qwen3-32B to identify and remove notebooks that either (1) had nothing to do with data analysis, or (2) didn’t actually use datasets. This step removed about 20% of the notebooks.\n\nThis ensured we trained only on relevant data science tasks.\n\nUsing the cleaned notebooks, we generated question–answer pairs using Qwen3-32B. The questions and answer are grounded in the real notebook traces so the QA pairs are based on real code execution results.\nPrompt design: we asked the LLM to produce natural questions that could realistically be asked of the dataset, then validated whether the notebook provided a correct answer.\n\nChallenge: We had to try many prompts to get higher-difficulty questions because LLMs tended to generate trivial ones like \"what is the size of the dataset\".\nInsight: We broke this into two steps because LLMs tended to hallucinate answers:\n\nThe complete prompting strategy and implementation is available in generate_qa.py.\n\nFinally we want to generate clean code execution traces since even the original notebooks after processing are often open ended and verbose with lots of irrelevant parts. However, we want our Jupyter Agent to get to the result efficiently. To generate cleaner notebook traces for training we generated traces synthetically based on the original notebooks.\nWe have prompted Qwen-3-Coder-480B model to generate a jupyter notebook code to answer the question from the previously generated synthetic QA pair. \nTraces captured step-by-step code execution, including intermediate outputs, which are crucial for agent training.\n\nWe used E2B for our agent to solve the synthetic QA pairs, which required fetching Kaggle datasets so the code could actually run via E2B.\n\nChallenge 1: Many datasets were unavailable.\nTrick: Since LLMs are strong at code and have a decent world model, we prompted them to act as a code interpreter when the dataset was missing.\n\nChallenge 2: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B model does not support thinking mode - how can we extract code commentary? By default it often outputs just a brief comment followed by several steps of code execution. However, we'd like some reasoning or comments between every cell. \nTrick: When switching from Qwen3-32B to Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B we noticed that often output message content was empty. This turns out to be a previously known quirk of Qwen3-Coder models in which when using tool calling the model would not return an empty assistant response. We enforce some text commentary through tooling by passing 'comment' as a required field in the code execution tool call. This way when non-reasoning model is used for code cell generation it will by default output some description of its actions from 1st POV, emulating the thinking traces structure.\n\nNote: the generated final answer in the notebook may vary from the answer specified in the QA pair. This is caused by the fact that the agent model could use data preprocessing methods and steps different from the original Kaggle notebook and the synthetic question would not usually specify them. This discrepancy is normal and lays the foundation for a new exciting research direction of how language models tend to treat data analysis and whether they do it differently from humans. For full transparency we keep both LLM-generated final answer and original answer from the real Kaggle notebook as a signal of model's performance. We encourage the community to try different dataset mixes to see how they can push performance even further.\n\nWe truncated overly long outputs and filtered out trivial traces to prevent content length issues and keep only high-quality traces.\nWe kept non-trivial, multi-turn traces aligned with DABStep-style tasks.\nThe resulting Jupyter Agent Dataset became the foundation for SFT on Qwen3-4B models with 51k synthetic notebooks and almost 0.2B tokens.\n\nWith this dataset in hand, the natural next step is to see whether it actually helps our model become a stronger data science agent. Let’s move on to the training pipeline and evaluate the impact!\n\nWith the curated dataset ready, we turned to the key question: does this data actually help the model get better at solving data analysis tasks?\nTo find out, we set up a simple fine-tuning pipeline and ran experiments to measure the impact of training on our synthetic notebooks.\n\nSome training steps turned out to be particularly interesting and gave us useful insights:\n\nOur complete training implementation, including hyperparameter configurations and template adaptations, is available in our finetuning directory in our repo.\n\nFirst, we generated our final dataset using Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B which contains high quality code and short reasoning-like traces. Afterwards, we started our training and we have experimented with various configurations like PEFT/adapters vs. full-parameter tuning, learning rate, number of epochs, adding noise and others. We found out, that full-parameter fine-tuning allows the model to learn and replicate the Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B behavior response quality better with shorter supporting commentary fitting more to the data analysis task without unnecessary long reasoning.\n\nWe have done a small ablation study on the impact of no. training epochs:\n\nWe observe that it is beneficial to have a bit more epochs than usual for SFT with lower learning rate and higher neftune noise (7). Finally, we compare our trained models with implemented scaffolding to define the pure impact of our training dataset. In summary, we can see up to 36%/22% boost on DABStep easy score compared with base/scaffolded model:\n\nWe can also see, that the hard score can increase too even though our dataset is focused on easier questions:\n\nFrom figures above one can notice a noticeable impact of both new scaffolding and tuning on our synthetic notebooks. This makes Qwen-4B (with our pipeline + scaffolding) a state-of-the-art small-model agent on DABStep.\n\nIn practice, the model can now solve a wide range of realistic Kaggle-style data analysis tasks with consistent execution.\nIt’s not yet strong enough for the hardest queries, but we’ve shown that even small models can become powerful agents when paired with the right data and scaffolding.\n\nThese results demonstrate that even small models can become powerful data science agents with the right training approach. Ready to try it yourself? We've made everything openly available so you can experiment with our fine-tuned models and dataset.\n\nWe openly release best-performing checkpoints of tuned Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 together with the training dataset, which you can try out and experiment with:\n\nYou can load Jupyter Agent Dataset in just a couple of lines using the following code:\n\nYou can also use sourced Kaggle datasets directly with E2B code execution using the following code:\n\nYou use tuned Jupyter Agent Qwen-based models following the Qwen documentation code:\n\nFor Thinking model you can decode both thinking response and content using the next code:\n\nMaybe this will lead to… Jupyter-Agent 3. 😉\n\nWe hope that our findings will inspire others to continue progress in developing more powerful notebook coding agents and we're excited to see what the community builds next.

Through the letter, the government has also sought a report on the actions taken by the company, and the immediate removal of illegal materials.ALSO READ | AI tool to 'undress women': Grok under fire for generating non-consensual sexualised images; Musk pokes funNow, X has submitted a reply to the ministry, however, the officials described it as ‘not adequate’, saying the response by the social media platform lacked specific actions taken and preventive steps implemented.Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had written to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, urging the government to urgently step in over what she described as a disturbing rise in the misuse of AI tools to sexualise women on social media, particularly on X.In her letter, Priyanka Chaturvedi called for strict “guardrails” on AI chatbots such as Grok, saying social media platforms must be made “a safe space for women”. She also underlined the need for better education of men from an early age to prevent such behaviour.“Have sought urgent attention and intervention of the IT Minister to take the issue of increasing incidents of AI apps being prompted to sexualise and undress women by unauthorised use of their images on social media,” Chaturvedi said in a post on X.In the letter shared publicly, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader flagged what she called an emerging trend on X, where men operating fake accounts allegedly upload photos of women and use AI prompts to minimise their clothing or sexualise them.“It is not just limited to sharing photos through fake accounts but are also targeting women who post their own photos,” she wrote.Calling the practice an “unacceptable and gross misuse of an AI function,” Chaturvedi also criticised Grok for “enabling this behaviour by adhering to such requests”.She described such acts as a “breach of women's right to privacy” and termed them “criminal”, adding that similar instances were “going absolutely unchecked” across other platforms as well.ALSO READ | Elon Musk's Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users after Deepfakes go viral across the world",

    "fullText": "Elizabeth Lopatto, writing at The Verge, “Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai Are Cowards”:\n\nSince X’s users started using Grok to undress women and\nchildren using deepfake images, I have been waiting for\nwhat I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s\nand Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet\ntells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim\nCook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of\nElon Musk.\n\nLopatto’s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google — and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies — are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It’s Trump, as president, they fear. Not Musk. And they are correct to fear Trump.\n\nYear one of Trump 2.0 has crystallized what had become — after decades of deliberate restraint after World War II, and even more so after the end of the Cold War — overlooked. The Presidency of the United States bestows upon its officeholder enormous, unparalleled, power. No one was afraid of Trump after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. The man was convicted of 34 felonies in a cold New York City courtroom in May 2024, a mere 19 months ago. Trump expected and asked for riots outside the courtroom. He got nothing but pathetic support from a handful of kooks. A year earlier, he lost a humiliating sexual assault civil lawsuit to E. Jean Carroll. Trump, just a year and a half ago, was a buffoon getting his mug shot taken. Today he’s arguing that his power is unchecked by anything other than his own sense of morality.\n\nNo other president has ever abused (or, if you support him, wielded) the powers of the office like Trump has. The power and influence of Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEOs of two of the top five companies in the world, isn’t merely superseded by Trump’s power and influence as president. Their power and influence are dwarfed by Trump’s. Any credible argument about how they should act must acknowledge that profound imbalance.\n\nI never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever\nagain. The next time Tim Cook says “privacy is a human\nright,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face.\nI mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has\ncreated an undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good,\nthe mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How do you plan\nto defend getting rid of the ICEBlock app while allowing X\nto generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and\nGoogle even identify their values beyond their commitment to\n“shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?\n\nThe profound power imbalance here is frustrating. But also terrifying. It’s folly to think these CEOs should steer their companies into direct confrontation with Trump. It would do no ultimate good for Apple or Google to burn themselves to the ground in protest. These men aren’t beholden to shareholders, per se. They’re doing their duty to institutions they’ve devoted their lives to. Companies that are worth preserving and protecting. Perhaps not in your estimation, but certainly from theirs.\n\nBut abject obsequiousness — which more and more seems the path Cook and Pichai are choosing — is no more justifiable a response than corporate suicide. The situation is not binary: acquiescence or war. There is a broad middle ground, founded on principle.\n\nDisney’s response to the Jimmy Kimmel controversy a few months ago shows the way. Defend the company’s principles while simultaneously defending the company from Trump’s demented wrath. You can take the position of “Fuck you, make me” without ever saying those words. Objection is not confrontation. Do the right thing and enforce the App Store and Play Store guidelines, and remove X and Grok from the stores. Make Musk object. Make the Trump administration object. Make them defend the indefensible — in public. Make clear why the apps were removed from the app stores and force Musk — and Trump, if he chooses — to argue that those things are A-OK by them. In court.\n\nThe judicious path for Apple and Google (and every other U.S. company) may well be to obey the law, even when the law is being actively corrupted. But the correct path is not to obey in advance. Stand behind the law while the law still exists on your side. Disney resisted Trump’s preposterous demand that they fire Jimmy Kimmel without lasting controversy, simply by standing firm in their conviction. Apple and Google could certainly do the same regarding apps that are being used to generate CSAM and deepfake harassment, regardless if the apps are part of the private fiefdom of Trump’s ally Elon Musk. It’s wise for Cook and Pichai to pick their battles. This one, I think, is worth picking. This is a moment when the App Store and Play Store can stand firmly on the side of longstanding and correct societal norms.",

The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,\" Yao said at an AI ‍conference in Beijing.\n\nChina has completed a working prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine potentially capable of producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips that rival the West's, Reuters reported last month. However, the machine has not yet produced working chips and may not do ​so until 2030, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nYao and other Chinese industry ‌leaders at the Beijing conference on Saturday also acknowledged that the U.S. maintains an advantage in computing power due to its hefty investments in infrastructure.\n\n\"The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours. But I see that whether it's OpenAI or other platforms, they're investing heavily in next-generation research,\" said Lin Junyang, technical lead for Alibaba's flagship Qwen large language model.\n\n\"We, on the other hand, are relatively strapped for ⁠cash; delivery alone likely consumes the majority of our computer infrastructure,\" ​Lin said during a panel discussion at the AGI-Next Frontier Summit ​held by the Beijing Key Laboratory of Foundational Models at Tsinghua University.\n\nLin said China's limited resources have spurred its researchers to be innovative, particularly through algorithm-hardware co-design, which enables AI ‍firms to run large models ⁠on smaller, inexpensive hardware.",

According to the CPCB, those readings surpassed the severe AQI levels.\n\nPoor AQI can be caused by a few factors, including elevated levels of pollutants such as particulate matter from human activities and ground-level ozone. Vehicle pollution, industrial processes, and the agriculture industry can directly cause massive spikes in poor air quality.\n\nNatural events like wildfires and dust storms can also play a big role in affecting air quality. These factors can even be exacerbated by warm and stagnant air, which can trap pollutants close to the ground, triggering extreme events such as the one seen in Delhi.\n\nAs AQI levels increase, potentially serious health risks can increase as well. This can cause vulnerable portions of the population to fall victim to respiratory health issues and even cardiovascular concerns. However, once AQI levels exceed severe levels, these increased health risks can impact the entire population.\n\n\"This looks dystopian as hell,\" said one user in the comments section.\n\nDo you think your city has good air quality?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Currently in [the] south of India and the AQI here is 16,\" another added. \"The scale on the app I use maxes out at 500, it's crazy what's happening in Delhi!\"\n\n\"This is what happens when you have a 200 AQI city due to pollution and then weather makes it 4x worse,\" suggested a third.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The U.S. is considering buying Greenland to secure its strategic interests in the Arctic, as Russia and China invest heavily in the region, and a negotiated transfer with compensation for Denmark would be the most effective way to secure the territory without resorting to force.",
    "fullText": "The White House is speaking loudly about Greenland. But volume should not be mistaken for madness. This isn’t a sudden lapse into imperial fantasy — it is power politics, plain and unsentimental, dressed in modern language but driven by old truths.\n\nGeography still governs fate. Distance can still protect or imperils nations. Ice still melts, routes still open, and rivals still move. Greenland sits at the center of it all — a vast slab of territory that dominates the map not by population, but by consequence.\n\nSet aside the outrage and the pearl-clutching, and the case becomes clear. Seen through a realist lens — the kind John Mearsheimer describes — power is never polite. Nations do not glide through history on good will. They compete, maneuver, and block rivals wherever they can.\n\nAmerica didn’t invent this contest, but it has played it for a century, shaping trade routes, locking down strategic chokepoints, and denying rivals room to expand. Exiting now would not end the game — it would simply forfeit the advantage.\n\nGreenland matters because the Arctic matters. Melting ice has turned what was once a frozen buffer into a contested corridor. Shipping lanes are emerging. Subsea cables snake across the ocean floor. Missile paths shorten. Surveillance gaps narrow. Russia knows this. China knows this. Both are investing heavily in Arctic presence, infrastructure and influence. The U.S. can either treat Greenland as a distant curiosity or as what it actually is: a forward position in a region that will define future power balances.\n\nThis is why the talk of acquiring it refuses to die. Under Trump, it has resurfaced less from recklessness than from bluntness. He says aloud what others preferred to bury in briefings. Previous administrations whispered the same concerns behind closed doors, then settled for half-measures and cosmetic compromises. Trump simply said the quiet part out loud, with his usual lack of decorum and surplus of disruption. Allies recoiled. But in cold political terms, offense is secondary to advantage.\n\nThe preferred path is obvious and needs no justification. Buying Greenland is better than bullying it. A negotiated transfer, with guarantees for Greenlanders and compensation for Denmark, would be cleaner, cheaper, and far less destabilizing than any military move. War in the Arctic would be absurd, expensive and counterproductive. Even floating the idea of force is less about intent than leverage. It is a reminder that the U.S. takes the matter seriously, not a rehearsal for invasion.\n\nCritics insist Greenland’s future is not Washington’s to decide. Formally, they are right. Strategically, however, that statement is comforting nonsense. In a world of rising rivalry, no great power allows vital terrain to drift into adversarial hands out of courtesy. Sovereignty is sacred until security is threatened; then it becomes negotiable. This isn’t cynicism, but the hard ledger of history.\n\nThe U.S. bought Louisiana not out of generosity, but to deny France control of the Mississippi. It backed Panama’s break from Colombia to secure a canal it deemed vital. It purchased Alaska to keep Russia away from its doorstep. Britain took Gibraltar for the same reason: Position beats principle when survival is involved. States talk reverently about borders, right up until borders threaten them. When security tightens, ideals are revised.\n\nThe European backlash, while predictable, is also revealing. Europe benefits enormously from American security guarantees, but recoils whenever Washington acts like a power rather than a charity. There is something faintly comic about NATO allies warning the U.S. against taking its own defense too seriously. The alliance rests, after all, on the assumption that America has never been a feelings-first power. Greenland reveals whether it still remembers that.\n\nEuropean nations insist Greenland is not for sale, while quietly relying on American troops, money and missiles to keep the peace that permits such comfortable posturing. It is a bit like lecturing the fire brigade on property rights while borrowing their hoses. Principles are easier to defend when someone else pays the insurance.\n\nThe deeper issue is not Trump’s rhetoric but America’s reluctance to admit what it is. The U.S. remains a global power in a competitive world. It cannot afford strategic blind spots disguised as virtue. Greenland is not a vanity project or a colonial hangover — it is a strategic anchor, a surveillance platform, a logistical hub, and a denial asset, all wrapped up into one. To lose influence there would not cause immediate collapse, but it would mark a significant retreat, the kind rivals notice long before voters do.\n\nThat is why this moment feels different. The language is sharper. The signals are stronger. Force remains the last resort, and rightly so. It is expensive, corrosive and unpredictable. Buying Greenland would cost money and pride, but far less than conflict. Realism doesn’t require hostility. The United States has often secured vital positions without resorting to force.\n\nIt gained long-term access to Iceland during World War II because the island mattered more than diplomatic niceties. It maintained strategic basing in Okinawa through negotiation, despite local resistance, because geography demanded it. It built Diego Garcia into a major military hub through negotiation and agreement rather than force. In each case, American security was strengthened without open conflict.\n\nGreenland deserves the same treatment now. Serious talks that reflect its importance. Offer fair payment to Denmark, respect local self-rule, and protect U.S. interests without turning the Arctic into an unnecessary flashpoint. Trump has his sights set on Greenland because the map leaves little room for alternatives.\n\nJohn Mac Ghlionn is a writer and researcher who explores culture, society and the impact of technology on daily life.",

Customers have been reporting that they have not received the merchandise they have paid for, nor have they received refunds.\n\nNow, the chain has shared in a press release and on its website that all stores are closing.\n\nWhen Value City Furniture's parent company, American Signature Furniture, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November, it intended to reorganize, according to documents filed on PacerMonitor.\n\n“In order to maximize value, the company has commenced a sale process pursuant to Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the hope of a competitive auction within approximately 45 days to elicit higher value for the benefit of all stakeholders. ASI expects to enter into a stalking horse asset purchase agreement with ASI Purchaser LLC under which, subject to court approval, ASI Purchaser LLC will acquire substantially all of the company’s assets and assume certain related liabilities,” it shared in a press release.\n\nThat process has culminated in the decision to close all locations after going-out-of-business sales. That news greeted visitors to the chain's website on Jan. 10.\n\n\"Closing Sales Now Underway at All American Signature Furniture and Value City Furniture Locations,\" the company shared.\n\nIt shared some color as to what happened during the bankruptcy process.\n\n\"In November 2025, American Signature Inc. began a court-supervised process to facilitate a sale. As a result of this process, American Signature Inc. is winding down operations and closing all remaining American Signature Furniture and Value City Furniture locations. Closing sales will continue while inventory lasts,\" it added.\n\n\"Since the end of the COVID boom, the combination of high interest rates and inflation have worked concurrently to stifle the housing market and limit consumers’ disposable income levels. Then, those issues were further compounded this year by rising costs on imports due to round after round of tariffs,\" Furniture Today reported.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump laid into Republican Senator Susan Collins in an expletive-laden phone call after she voted against one of his top priorities.\n\nThe president reportedly made a “profanity-laced” call to the vulnerable Republican senator on Thursday, sources told The Hill. Collins was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act from committee to the floor, which passed in a 52-47 vote earlier in the day.\n\n“He was very mad about the vote,” the source told The Hill. “Very mad. Very hot.”\n\nThe resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela following the U.S. capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. This throws a wrench in Trump’s plans to seize Venezuela’s oil.\n\nThe source told The Hill that the president “basically read her the riot act,” in a phone call that came “out of the blue.” Collins’ office confirmed to The Hill that the call took place, but did not include any additional details on what the president said. The Daily Beast reached out to the senator’s representatives and the White House for comment.\n\nIn addition to Collins, Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young also voted to advance the war powers resolution. The move made Trump irate. He posted at length about the five conservative lawmakers on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump wrote. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nCollins is up for reelection this year and faces a tight race as Democratic challengers gain in popularity. Her seat will be important for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate after the midterms. However, Trump has been a thorn in his party’s side, openly expressing his desire to see Collins out. This latest call appears to reaffirm his animosity toward the senator.\n\n“The president obviously is unhappy with the vote,” Collins told reporters following Trump’s ire. “I guess this means that he would prefer to have Gov. Mills or somebody else with whom he’s not had a great relationship. I don’t know, I’m just not going to comment.”\n\nThe president has faced pressure and criticism following the operation in Venezuela that ended in Maduro’s capture. While Maduro sits in custody awaiting trial, Trump has announced plans for the U.S. to “run” Venezuela and sell millions of barrels of its oil.\n\nTrump met with major oil executives from companies like Chevron and Exxon on Friday to discuss Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. However, the president, 79, quickly veered off-topic, pausing the meeting to wax poetic about the White House ballroom currently under construction.",

Now, the agency says it could launch as early as February, with the first flight opportunity being on February 6. NASA is currently making the final preparations for the mission and will soon roll out the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft to their launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The spacecraft system’s four-mile journey from the assembly building to Launch Pad 39B will take up to 12 hours. NASA is targeting a date no earlier than January 17, with the exact day depending on the weather and on the possible need for additional time to address technical issues.Artemis 2 is the first crewed mission to the moon since the Apollo program’s final flight in 1972. The 10-day mission will have four astronauts on board who’ll be testing if Orion’s critical life support systems can sustain human passengers on future longer duration missions. They will first orbit the Earth twice before making their way 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon. If the SLS and Orion system is rolled out as planned, NASA intends to conduct a wet dress rehearsal at the end of January. The agency will load cryogenic propellants into the rocket and will do a full launch countdown during the rehearsal to prepare for the real event.",

    "fullText": "T-Mobile, one of the top phone carriers in the U.S., is shifting its strategy as it battles increased customer losses and tougher competition from its growing list of rivals.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, T-Mobile's postpaid phone churn rate (the number of customers who cancel their phone service) reached 0.89%, which is 3 basis points higher than the churn it reported for the same quarter last year, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nThe concerning loss of loyal customers comes after T-Mobile implemented price increases and phone plan changes throughout the year, which sparked backlash. It also comes during a time when the company’s top competitors, Verizon and AT&T, have both been launching free perks and phone deals to attract customers.\n\nCable companies, such as Spectrum and Xfinity, have also been luring customers away from traditional phone carriers by offering discounted phone plans when bundled with TV and internet.\n\nAs the wireless market becomes increasingly competitive, more consumers are exploring various options for more affordable phone plans outside their current provider, especially as they grapple with rising monthly bills, according to a recent survey from Oxio.\n\nApproximately 90% of consumers would consider alternatives to traditional carriers.\n\nAdditionally, 85% consider cost to be a primary factor in selecting a mobile provider.\n\nAdditionally, 46% of consumers rank a lower-priced plan as their main reason for switching providers, while 33% prioritize better network coverage.\n\n“The research shows that many consumers are looking for greater plan clarity and value – they want services that match what they actually use,” said Oxio CcxEO Nicolas Girard in a statement. “We’re seeing a strong interest in personalization, transparency, and more control over mobile services.”\n\nAmid this growing trend, T-Mobile has introduced a new phone plan that it claims is its “most value-packed plan ever,” according to a recent press release.\n\nT-Mobile’s new “Better Value” phone plan starts at $140 a month for three lines with autopay, meaning each line is $46 for families, plus taxes and fees.\n\nThe plan also includes a five-year price-lock guarantee on talk, text and data. It also features unlimited premium data on T-Mobile’s 5G network and unlimited hotspot data, which includes 250GB of high-speed hotspot data every month (600 kbps after).\n\nCustomers will also have unlimited data abroad, specifically 30GB of high-speed data per month (256 kbps after) in over 215 countries and destinations. Satellite connectivity is also included with unlimited text and data via satellite-optimized apps.\n\nSome perks attached to the plan include free Netflix and Hulu subscriptions, and Apple TV for $3 per month. It also offers home internet backup for an additional $10 per month with autopay (plus taxes and fees), and two-year device upgrades.\n\nT-Mobile stated that its Better Value plan will save families over $1,000 compared to similar plans from AT&T and Verizon, thanks to these “built-in benefits.” It also stated that existing T-Mobile customers looking to upgrade from their Essentials family plan with three or more lines can save over $50 a month on benefits by switching to its Better Value plan.\n\n“Families are looking for ways to save and get more value from the services they rely on every day, especially wireless,” said Mike Katz, T-Mobile chief business and product officer, in the press release. “While AT&T and Verizon keep asking people to pay more for less, we’re doing the opposite.”\n\nCurrently, depending on the plan tier, Verizon charges customers about $100 to $175 per month for three lines on its unlimited plans (with autopay activated and before taxes and fees). They also come with a three-year price-lock guarantee.\n\nAT&T charges families roughly $138 to $183 per month, depending on the plan tier, for three lines on its unlimited plans. These prices are also before taxes and fees, and with the monthly autopay discount activated.\n\nThe move from T-Mobile follows its launch of a new initiative last month called “15 Minutes to Better,” which ensures that consumers can switch phone carriers in 15 minutes or less.\n\nThe switching process is completed through either T-Mobile’s T-Life app or website, where consumers can sign in to their current plan from a rival phone carrier using the company’s “Easy Switch” tool, which will match them with a competitive T-Mobile offer.\n\nT-Mobile has been stepping up its game to compete with Verizon and AT&T, as they are all nearly neck-and-neck in terms of market share in the wireless telecommunications industry.\n\nT-Mobile announces free offer for Verizon and AT&T customers\n\n​​Verizon CEO sounds alarm on why customers are leaving in droves\n\nSpectrum raises red flag on cause of fleeing customer problem\n\nCurrently, T-Mobile owns 20.8% market share in the industry, while Verizon owns 23.8% and AT&T owns 19.4%, according to data from market research company IBISWorld, which was shared with TheStreet.\n\nT-Mobile has also been facing the growing threat of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs). These wireless providers lease network capacity, offering more competitive pricing to consumers, compared to traditional phone carriers, and they have higher satisfaction rates, according to a recent survey from J.D. Power.\n\nT-Mobile has a consumer satisfaction score of 636 (on a 1,000-point scale)for its postpaid plans, surpassing Verizon and AT&T, which have scores of 583 and 573, respectively.\n\nHowever, MVNOs have an average satisfaction score of 641.\n\nSpecifically, Consumer Cellular has a score of 726, while Google Fi Wireless has a score of 671.\n\n“The findings show that value is the most important driver of the overall experience, followed closely by service quality,” said Carl Lepper, senior director of technology, media and telecom at J.D. Power, in a press release.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Rams entered Saturday evening’s joust with the Panthers as heavy favorites. Among the biggest reasons why was star hurler Matthew Stafford. Los Angeles’ veteran signal-caller authored an MVP-caliber campaign, amassing a league-leading total in passing touchdowns and passing yards.\n\nAgainst Carolina, Stafford appeared destined to recreate his regular-season success. He successfully tossed arrows all across the Bank of America Stadium plains in the first two quarter, conjuring spells against the Panthers' weary defense.\n\nStafford's performance faded as the match wore on, felled by an inspired Carolina rearguard and an apparent hand injury. Nevertheless, his first-half showing was enough to see him climb up the Rams’ record books.\n\nWith that, here’s a look at Stafford’s performance vs. Carolina by the numbers.\n\nMORE: Why Rico Dowdle split reps with Chuba Hubbard vs. Rams\n\nHalftime score: Rams 17, Panthers 14\n\nStafford put forth an impressive display in the first half, collecting yardage in bunches. He connected with Puka Nacua for one score and set the BYU alum up for another, although the play was eventually ruled a run play.\n\nStafford's efficiency was noteworthy. He found his target on eight of his first nine throws, producing a passer rating that would rank as one of the best in postseason history.\n\nAll that amounted to an efficient and effective first half showing for Stafford, who reiterated his MVP credentials with another glistening display — this time, under the playoff lights.\n\nMORE: Meet Matthew Stafford’s wife, Kelly, along with his four daughters\n\nStafford's first-half outburst surged him to the top of Los Angeles' postseason record books. He became the Rams' all-time leading playoff passer against the Panthers, eclipsing a host of icons — including Kurt Warner — to take the title of best postseason hurler in franchise history.\n\nMORE: Puka Nacua stats performance vs. Panthers\n\nHere's a look at where he stands on the Rams' all-time list:\n\nWhile Stafford enjoyed another sterling day under the lights, the numbers he accrue throughout the postseason will not count towards his MVP candidacy. Votes for the famous award have already been filed, meaning that Stafford cannot actually improve his chances at landing the prize.\n\nSN's expert predictions for NFL playoffs, Super Bowl 60\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nStafford is a Super Bowl champion, having hoisted the hardware in 2022 after leading Los Angeles to a 23-20 win over the Bengals in Super Bowl 56.\n\nStafford wasn't quite faultless in his showing. He tossed two interceptions on the day, seeing his patented efficiency slow amid Cincinnati's harrowing pass rush.\n\nStill, his final line was reflective of one of his generation's best gunslingers: 26-of-40 passing for 283 yards, three touchdowns and two picks.",

    "fullText": "Is Matthew Stafford injured? Rams QB's performance dips after taking hit to hand vs. Panthers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMatthew Stafford enjoyed a sizzling start during the Rams’ joust with the Panthers in Saturday’s wild-card game. Los Angeles’ wily veteran completed eight of his first nine passes, setting up Puka Nacua with a touchdown as the Rams opened a 14-point advantage over their heavily favored opposition.\n\nBut as the game wore on and Carolina built its way back into the contest, things changed for Stafford. Plays that once appeared routine for the 37-year-old proved far more challenging. Incompletions piled up for the MVP frontrunner, leaving many uncertain about what had changed.\n\nFox’s broadcast crew suggested Stafford’s struggles weren’t organic, but rather the result of an injury to his throwing hand. While the malady might not fully explain some of Stafford’s uncharacteristic mistakes, it could provide some context for his foibles.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Stafford’s status following his alleged hand injury.\n\nThings were humming for Stafford in the first half. The Super Bowl champion laced passes all about the Bank of America Stadium pitch, finding his target with increasing regularity.\n\nBut partway through the second quarter, Stafford was momentarily cut down by injury. As he attempted a throw, he hit his hand on the crown of an onrushing Carolina defender.\n\nMatthew Stafford appeared to have hurt his hand in the first half ⬇️\n\n📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/QQo0FHNW0N\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 10, 2026\n\nStafford gripped his hand and grimaced as he rose off the turf, flexing his hand tightly. His efficiency faded as the game wore on, with incompletions — and an interception — spilling into his previously faultless display.\n\nThere was a marked difference in Stafford's showing before and after his apparent injury. Stafford started the day flawless — 8-of-8 for 107 yards and one touchdown. After clattering his hand against the Panthers rusher, he went 16-of-34 with 197 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Noted for his patented efficiency, Stafford's throws lost their luster slightly as the game continued. He found his form when it counted, though, finding Cody Parkinson with a delicate toss in the corner of the end zone to deliver a four-point win to Los Angeles.",

A win against the Miami Hurricanes would make the Hoosiers the first major college football program to finish 16-0 since Yale Bulldogs accomplished the feat in 1894 — an era of leather helmets and no forward pass.\n\nWhat makes Indiana’s run even more remarkable is how it was built.

Once one of the most consistent rebuild jobs in the Big Ten, Indiana is now one win from the most dominant single season in program history.\n\nMore: Fernando Mendoza's family ties to Mario Cristobal run deep with Miami homecoming\n\nIndiana announced itself on the sport’s biggest stage with a 56-22 dismantling of the Oregon Ducks in the Peach Bowl.

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Hayes Fawcett, the Texas Longhorns have landed a commitment from linebacker Rasheem Biles out of the NCAA transfer portal. Biles spent the last two seasons with the Pitt Panthers, turning into an All-ACC player. Steve Sarkisian and new defensive coordinator Will Muschamp now take over his talents, hoping it translates in the SEC.\n\nLinebacker has been a position of importance for Texas in the transfer portal this offseason. There has been plenty of turnover there, both due to the 2026 NFL Draft and guys leaving for other schools. Somebody with the ability to bring an immediate impact was needed in Austin, and Biles is the guy.\n\nBiles played in 10 games last season for Pitt, starting in nine of them. A total of 101 tackles, 17 tackles for a loss, and 4.5 interceptions proved to be good enough for second-team All-ACC honors. You can add in two interceptions (both of which were returned for touchdowns), six passes defended, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. Basically, Biles was all over the field this past year.\n\nIf those stats were not enough, the On3 Industry Transfer Portal rankings believe one of the very best is heading to Texas. Biles is a four-star prospect and the No. 16 overall player to enter this cycle. Nobody is ranked higher when it comes to the linebacker position, either.\n\nPlenty of other schools were interested in Biles’ commitment during the transfer process. The likes of Colorado, Miami, Michigan, and Ohio State were a part of the discussion at one point. Instead, Texas found a way to get this one over the finish line.\n\nThe Longhorns are coming off a disappointing season, going 9-3 and missing the College Football Playoff. Sarkisian is working to retool the roster so the same fate is not shared at the conclusion of the 2026 season. Plenty of work remains but snagging somebody like Biles is a massive step in the right direction.\n\nTexas will open the ’26 campaign on Sept. 5 vs. Texas State, where you can assume it will be debut day for Biles. One week later will grab all the attention, though, as Ohio State comes to Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium for the first time since 2006.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

Carolina’s draft position is now locked into place at No. 19. The rest of the teams that lose this weekend will fill in slots 20-24.\n\nCarolina ranked near the bottom of the NFL in 2026 in sacks with 30, and edge rusher is absolutely a top need heading into free agency and the draft. Rico Dowdle was the team’s leading rusher, with 1,076 yards and six rushing touchdowns, plus contributed 297 receiving yards and a touchdown through the air, and he’s hitting free agency. Christian Rozeboom, the Panthers’ tackles leader who also had two sacks, three pass break-ups, a pick and a forced fumble, will also become a free agent when the new league year ends. The Panthers are projected to have about $39 million in cap space to work with this offseason based on the 51-man projection, but obviously when they can shore up these key positions through the draft, it makes long-term team building for success easier.\n\nHere’s the updated draft order after the Panthers’ Wild Card exit.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (via Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (via Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (via Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (via Jacksonville Jaguars)",

Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe are grateful to the International Tax Policy Forum for financial support of this project.

    "description": "Why the doomsayers are wrong: npm, PyPI, and NuGet downloads are exploding",
    "fullText": "Earlier this week, Adam Wathan, the creator of Tailwind CSS, dropped a bombshell about how AI has impacted his company and its employees:\n\nthe reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. And every second I spend trying to do fun free things for the community like this is a second I’m not spending trying to turn the business around and make sure the people who are still here are getting their paychecks every month.\n\nThe reaction was swift and predictable. Hot takes flooded in declaring the death of open source, the end of OSS sustainability, and the AI apocalypse that would render libraries and frameworks obsolete. Geoffrey Huntley captured the prevailing narrative perfectly1:\n\n“AI can generate code, bypassing the need to deal with open-source woes… I’ve found myself using less open source these days… This shift challenges the role of open-source ecosystems.”\n\nI had a tweet about the Tailwind situation go viral and there were dozens of quote tweets and comments echoing the very same. “AI eats open source” is easy to find in abundance online.\n\nHere’s the problem: everyone is getting this perfectly backwards.\n\nAI isn’t killing open source. It’s amplifying it to unprecedented levels. The Tailwind situation isn’t about declining OSS adoption - it’s about a business model that was working great in a world where learning curves were high and documentation was the bottleneck. That world is gone, and the revenue model built on top of it is collapsing. But the underlying Tailwind library? It’s thriving.\n\nLet me show you why the doomsayers are wrong, backed by actual data from our own experience with Akka.NET and broader ecosystem trends that tell a very different story.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a two-part series. This post covers why AI is accelerating open source adoption, not killing it. Part 2 examines which business models thrive and which collapse in the AI era - and what Tailwind’s situation teaches us about adapting. \n\nI’ve been maintaining Akka.NET, a complex distributed systems framework, for over a decade. If AI was going to kill any open source project, it should have be ours. Actor model? Message-passing? Concurrency? Distributed systems? This is exactly the kind of “complex stuff” that AI should supposedly generate on the fly, right?\n\nWe’re not an outlier. Let me show you three very different frameworks - all thriving:\n\nTailwind CSS - The framework at the center of this controversy:\n\nTailwind more than doubled its downloads in 2025. The framework that supposedly proves AI is killing open source had its best year ever - by a massive margin.\n\nNServiceBus - Enterprise messaging framework (15+ years old, commercial licensing):\n\nNServiceBus is exactly the kind of enterprise infrastructure Geoffrey Huntley expects AI to replace. And it’s growing at 35%+ annually - the same rate as before AI coding tools existed. And it’s been commercially licensed for years - surely someone who wanted this type of functionality would just fire up Claude Code to eliminate it, right?\n\nAccording to Sonatype’s State of the Software Supply Chain 20242 report:\n\nIf AI was replacing open source libraries, why are package downloads exploding at unprecedented rates? Why are dependency counts climbing? Why is every major package registry showing record growth?\n\nThe answer is simple: AI is discovering and adopting open source libraries faster than humans ever could.\n\nHere’s what the AI doomsayers fundamentally misunderstand about how Large Language Models work: they’re trained to find the shortest path to a working solution.\n\nWhen you ask Claude or GPT-5 to build a distributed system, what do you think is the shorter path?\n\nOption A: Generate thousands of lines of custom actor model implementation, cluster management, network protocols, failure detectors, and state replication logic - all from scratch, all needing testing, all potentially buggy.\n\nOption B: dotnet add package Akka and configure the proven, tested, battle-hardened framework that’s in the training data with millions of examples.\n\nThe LLM isn’t stupid. It’s going to pick Option B every single time, unless you explicitly tell it not to - and even then it might fight you3.\n\nThis is why the “AI will generate everything custom” narrative falls apart on contact with reality. Yes, AI can generate custom components. But developers don’t want custom CSS frameworks - they want to ship. They want the thing that makes them money shipped yesterday. Using established libraries is how you get there expeditiously.\n\nHere’s where it gets really interesting. Established open source projects have a massive, compounding advantage in the AI era: years of training data.\n\nThink about what’s in those training sets:\n\nEvery time someone asks “how do I build a distributed system in .NET?” the training data screams “AKKA.NET” across thousands of documents. The LLM doesn’t need to think creatively. It’s pattern matching against an enormous corpus of successful implementations.\nThis creates a virtuous cycle:\n\nPopular projects have more training data → LLMs recommend them more → More people use them → More training data gets created → The cycle continues.\n\nThe rich get richer, and in this case, that’s actually a good thing for software quality.\n\nNow compare that to generating a custom solution. The LLM has… what? Generic distributed systems theory? Sure. But where are the battle-tested examples? Where are the debugging sessions? Where are the “here’s what went wrong in production and how we fixed it” stories?\n\nThey don’t exist. Because you’re asking the AI to invent something new.\n\nRemember when adopting a new library meant:\n\nFor a human developer, that’s a full day or two of investment before you’re productive. The mental math was always: “Is learning this library worth the time investment vs. building something custom that I already understand?”\n\nAI just arbitraged that entire calculation out of existence.\n\nWhen I ask Claude to “implement an Akka.NET cluster with cluster sharding and split-brain resolution,” it doesn’t need to read the docs. It doesn’t need the tutorial. It usually outputs working code with proper configuration in seconds. The learning curve is effectively zero.\n\nThis fundamentally changes the adoption math. The barrier to using any established library is now “can the AI generate correct code for it?” If yes, adoption becomes frictionless.\n\nGuess which libraries have the most examples for AI to learn from? The established ones. The popular ones. The ones with network effects and community momentum.\n\nAI can generate impressive things from scratch. People have used agentic loops to build entire programming languages, compilers, and complex systems - all generated by AI with minimal human intervention. These are genuine technical achievements that prove AI can build sophisticated software.\n\nBut here’s the question nobody’s asking: would you run your production systems on them?\n\nThe answer depends entirely on blast radius - what happens when things go wrong4.\n\nThe libraries that AI can safely replace are the ones with low blast radius. If your AI-generated UI component looks a little funny or renders slightly different than expected, nobody dies. You fix it and move on. The cost of failure is measured in minutes of debugging.\n\nBut if your AI-generated embedded operating system core dumps constantly? Someone might actually die. If your AI-generated authentication library has a subtle flaw? You get breached. If your AI-generated distributed consensus algorithm has an edge case bug? You lose data across your entire cluster.\n\nProduction systems don’t run on “technically works” - they run on battle-hardened, community-tested, security-audited infrastructure that’s been proven across thousands of deployments over years. That’s React. Linux. PostgreSQL. Akka.NET. NServiceBus. The boring, reliable stuff that’s growing 35-126% annually.\n\nThere’s another dimension here: institutionalized experience.\n\nA venerable codebase like Akka.NET doesn’t just contain code - it contains decades of accumulated wisdom across millions of deployments and tens of thousands of applications. All running on different hardware, serving different use cases, developed by different people. Every bug fix is a production war story. Every edge case handler is a lesson learned the hard way. Every configuration option exists because someone, somewhere, needed it in production.\n\nLLMs can synthesize code. They can pattern-match against training data. But they are no substitute for thousands of person-years of lived experience encoded into a codebase. That wisdom doesn’t exist in the training data - it exists in the accumulated decisions of maintainers who’ve seen every way a distributed system can fail.\n\nWhen you dotnet add package Akka, you’re not just getting code. You’re getting the institutional memory of a decade of production deployments. AI can’t generate that. It can only recommend the libraries that already have it.\n\nThe libraries actually at risk from AI generation are the ones with low blast radius - simple utilities, UI components, basic tooling where failure is cheap and recoverable. The critical infrastructure where failure is catastrophic? That’s not going anywhere. It’s accelerating.\n\n“Sure,” I hear you saying, “AI won’t replace frameworks, but what about all the smaller libraries? What about utilities and helpers?”\n\nFair question. Let’s think through the actual use cases.\n\nDeveloper needs a date formatting function. AI can generate it. But… so could a library. And the library version is tested. And documented. And handles edge cases. And gets security updates.\n\nWhat’s actually happening in practice? AI is finding and using existing utility libraries faster than humans would have. date-fns, lodash, NodaTime - these libraries aren’t declining, they’re exploding in adoption.5\n\nScenario 2: Custom Business Logic\n\nDeveloper needs a specific component for their application. AI generates it custom. Perfect! This is exactly what should be custom. This was never the domain of reusable open source anyway.\n\nScenario 3: Complex, Critical Systems\n\nDeveloper needs authentication, database access, distributed coordination, payment processing. AI could generate custom implementations. But would you ship them to production? Would you stake your business on AI-generated cryptography? On custom distributed consensus?\n\nOf course not. You use Postgres, Entity Framework, Akka.NET, OpenSSL - the proven solutions with years of production hardening.\n\nHere’s what the Tailwind situation actually tells us: AI is devastating businesses that sell what LLMs can generate.\n\nThe numbers tell the whole story:\n\nThe most successful year in the framework’s history coincided with the business collapse. This isn’t a contradiction - it’s the clearest illustration of what AI actually disrupts.\n\nTailwind’s commercial business is Tailwind Plus - premium UI components, templates, and blocks. The free documentation served as the primary sales funnel: developers would visit the docs to learn Tailwind, discover the premium components, and purchase them.\n\nAI broke this model in two devastating ways.\n\nFirst: The sales funnel dried up.\n\nRemember learning curve arbitrage? When developers use AI to generate Tailwind code, they don’t need to visit the documentation. Adam noted that docs traffic is down about 40% from early 2023 - despite Tailwind being more popular than ever. Fewer eyeballs on the docs means fewer people discovering the premium products exist.\n\nSecond: The product itself became AI-generatable.\n\nAI undercut Tailwind’s business model. Selling those components was about eliminating friction for users - buy a pre-made pricing table instead of building one yourself. But AI found an even cheaper way to eliminate that friction: generate the component on demand, for free.\n\nWhen a developer asks an AI for a “responsive pricing table with Tailwind,” the LLM isn’t going to say “log into your Tailwind Plus account and download the pricing component.” It’s going to generate one from scratch. That’s the shortest path.\n\nUI components and templates are exactly the kind of low-blast-radius output that AI handles well. If the generated component looks slightly different than a premium template, nobody cares. You tweak it and move on.\n\nTailwind’s business model put them directly in competition with their own framework’s AI-assisted usage. The better AI gets at generating Tailwind code, the less reason anyone has to buy pre-built components.\n\nThe framework thrives. The component business struggles. Same company, opposite trajectories - because one benefits from AI adoption and the other is displaced by it.\n\nAI isn’t killing open source. It’s creating the golden age of open source consumption.\n\nMore developers can adopt more libraries faster than ever before. The friction that kept people building custom solutions has evaporated. The learning curves that protected mediocre alternatives have disappeared.\n\nWhat we’re seeing is consolidation around quality, acceleration of adoption, and the destruction of business models that were built on selling what AI can now generate.\n\nTailwind CSS isn’t dying. Tailwind Plus might be dying - time will tell to see how they pivot. But the CSS framework itself is more popular than ever. The component products built on top of it? Those are being outcompeted by the LLMs recommending the framework.\n\nIf you’re an open source maintainer, this is your moment. If you’ve built something genuinely valuable - critical infrastructure with high blast radius, strong community, clear use cases - you’re about to see adoption curves that would have taken a decade compress into a few years.\n\nThe future of open source isn’t bleak. It’s brighter than it’s ever been. But the businesses built on top of them? That’s a different story - and it’s what we’ll dig into in Part 2.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a two-part series. Part 2 examines which open source business models thrive and which collapse in the AI era. The same AI wave that disrupted Tailwind’s business certainly didn’t hurt ours - our support subscriptions grew 19% in 2025, and AI-driven adoption likely contributed. Part 2 examines what makes some OSS business models resilient while others struggle. \n\nWhat’s your experience been? Are you seeing AI tools increase or decrease your open source usage? Hit me up on Twitter/X - I’m curious to hear how this is playing out across different ecosystems.\n\nGeoff wrote this all the way back in June 2025, well before this Tailwind situation. Ahead of his time. ↩\n\nA 2025 report would be preferable, but alas there isn’t one yet. ↩\n\nReward hacking is a property of frontier models you’ll encounter in all sorts of interesting ways.

    "description": "Sakana AI Agent Wins AtCoder Heuristic Contest (First AI to Place 1st)",
    "fullText": "Sakana AI’s “ALE-Agent” achieved a historic milestone by securing 1st place in the AtCoder Heuristic Contest 058, outperforming 804 human participants. To contextualize the difficulty of these optimization challenges, an OpenAI agent previously secured 2nd place in the AHC world tournament last August. This victory marks the first known instance of an AI agent winning a major optimization programming contest in real-time. The result demonstrates that by utilizing inference-time scaling with multiple frontier models, AI agents can now match or exceed the performance of top human experts in complex tasks requiring extended reasoning.\n\nDuring the 4-hour contest, our agent autonomously discovered a novel algorithm that outperformed the problem setters’ intended solution. While the problem setters’ anticipated a standard approach combining constructive heuristics and simulated annealing (SA), our ALE-Agent independently derived a “virtual power” heuristic and a sophisticated SA strategy with diverse neighborhood search operations, allowing it to escape local optima more effectively than human competitors.\n\nOperating at a total cost of approximately $1,300, the agent engaged in parallel code generation and iterative analysis, proving that AI is now capable of the original scientific discovery and trial-and-error required for high-level problem solving.\n\nFor the detailed information, including the logs and analysis output by ALE-Agent during the contest, see: https://sakanaai.github.io/fishylene-ahc058/ and our earlier NeurIPS’25 paper.\n\nThe AtCoder Heuristic Contest (AHC) is a series of programming competitions focused on optimization problems related to real-world industrial challenges, such as logistics optimization and factory production scheduling. These contests are characterized by approximately 1,000 programmers including experts active in various industrial sectors. Participants tackle a single, complex coding challenge, with contest durations ranging from four hours to two weeks.\n\nAHC has garnered significant global attention. In August 2025, a world championship featuring top-tier players was held, where an AI agent from OpenAI participated and won 2nd place. Sakana AI has also co-developed ALE-Bench, a benchmark platform based on AHC, in collaboration with AtCoder Inc. Furthermore, under special permission, our AI agent called ALE-Agent has been continuously participating in AHCs in real-time.\n\nAHC058, held on December 14, 2025, was conducted over a 4-hour competition window. The problem involved a setting where participants could produce machines with hierarchical relationships, such as multiple types of “apple-producing machines” and “machines that build those machines.” The objective was to construct an efficient production planning algorithm by determining which types and hierarchies of machines to upgrade and in what specific order.\n\nWhile the setting may seem humorous at first glance, these hierarchical production dependencies mirror real-world supply chains, food webs, and manufacturing processes, making it a scientifically interesting problem setup. For further details on the problem, please refer to the contest’s problem statement.\n\nALE-Agent began making submissions two hours after the contest started and immediately leapt to 1st place in the provisional standings.\n\nIn the middle of the contest, ALE-Agent was in a fierce dead heat with yosupo, the eventual 2nd-place finisher. ALE-Agent regained 1st place approximately two and a half hours into the contest and maintained the lead until the end to secure the victory.\n\nIn AHC058, the solution expected by the problem author was an approach that used algorithms like Greedy methods or Beam Search to determine a global strategic plan, followed by Simulated Annealing (SA) to refine the plan’s finer details.\n\nALE-Agent’s answer followed the same basic flow as a human: “construction by Greedy → refinement by SA.” However, it was a quintessential “AI-style” solution that maximized the AI’s strengths: numerous implementations and exhaustive trial and error. Analysis of the final program revealed the following characteristics:\n\nAnalyzing the process through which ALE-Agent generated its response revealed that it implemented the solution while deepening its understanding of the problem’s characteristics. (Logs can be viewed on this page).\n\nThe latest version of ALE-Agent is equipped with a mechanism to repeat trial and error by generating multiple programs simultaneously, summarizing those results to generate insights, and utilizing them for subsequent code generation. Looking at the insights generated by ALE-Agent, we can see it examining the problem based on experience; it mentioned the compound interest effect in connection with investment knowledge, devised high-speed algorithms using mathematics from an early stage, and discussed the nature of the search space, noting that initial strategies cause significant differences.\n\nWe received comments regarding ALE-Agent’s performance and approach from two experts familiar with the optimization field and AHC.\n\nFrom Hiroomi Nochide (AtCoder handle: itigo):\n\nActually, before the contest started, I thought this problem would be difficult for LLMs. This is because solving this problem with a Greedy method requires experimental insight that LLMs typically struggle with, and I thought a high score would be impossible without this human-centric consideration. However, when the results came out, I was stunned to see fishylene win.\n\nChecking the logs, it tried a vast number of patterns with promising directions and discovered a clever simulated annealing method that was not anticipated at the time the problem was created. I am impressed, thinking, ‘How did it find such a method?’ (In the logs, the parts requiring the experimental insight I initially expected did not appear, and given that humans still excelled in the Greedy portion, I believe human accuracy in consideration is still superior. However,) the overwhelming number of trial-and-error steps combined with LLM reasoning is an advantage humans do not have. While I feel fishylene is a formidable rival, I believe this technology will be a tremendous weapon for humanity.\n\n(Note: fishylene is ALE-Agent’s AtCoder account name)\n\nHiroomi Nochide authored the problem for AHC058. He is one of the world’s top players (24th in AHC world rankings) and a professional in this field at ALGO ARTIS CORPORATION.\n\nFrom Yoichi Iwata (AtCoder handle: wata):\n\nThis problem required optimizing investment plans for multiple series of production machines, where the high-level choice of which series to select as ‘final investment targets’ and ‘intermediate investment targets’ was essentially the core issue. With simple local improvement methods that only slightly change the investment target at each turn, it is difficult to switch this global strategy midway, often leading to poor local optima.\n\nThe expected solution from the author’s side was a two-stage approach: first explore a wide range of global investment plan candidates using a lightweight solver, and then spend time optimizing the promising ones. In contrast, the solutions from ALE-Agent and the runner-up, yosupo, were based on local search but introduced ‘Large Neighborhoods’ that change a huge portion of the investment plan at once to escape local optima. In particular, ALE-Agent utilized a diversified Greedy method to reconstruct large parts of the plan, which seems to have led to its performance advantage.\n\nHistorically, ALE-Agent has tended to choose solutions within the author’s expected range, yet its high implementation and optimization power allowed it to reach the top ranks among many participants using similar methods, especially in short-duration contests. This time, it was very impressive to see it go one step further and reach a solution that exceeded the author’s expectations.\n\nYoichi Iwata oversees AHC at AtCoder. He has an outstanding track record in this field, including winning the 2010 TopCoder Open. His scores in pre-contest test plays sometimes exceed the top participant scores, and he ensures the high quality of AHC problems.\n\nALE-Agent is an agent that performs algorithm discovery by utilizing multiple LLMs to create solutions in parallel, selecting the best ones, and reasoning further based on the results of trial and error. As such, it requires a high volume of LLM calls. The resources utilized during the 4-hour contest were as follows:\n\nThis result is significant as it demonstrates that even for multi-hour tasks, by scaling inference costs and running a properly designed AI agent, AI can reach or surpass the performance of top human experts.\n\nIdentifying which specific elements of ALE-Agent’s design contributed most to this dramatic result remains an important research task for the future. Our current analysis suggests that in addition to scaling LLM calls and injecting domain knowledge, a “self-learning mechanism,” which extracts insights from trial-and-error trajectory and reflects them in the next improvement cycle, played an important role.\n\nAs highlighted in evaluation reports such as those from METR (Model Evaluation and Threat Research), the latest AI models are beginning to show high proficiency in tasks requiring several hours of human effort. Our result follows this trend but is unique in showing that an AI agent with appropriate mechanisms and inference scaling can rival top human experts.\n\nHowever, at this point, AI does not always rival or surpass top humans. The table below shows ALE-Agent’s past performance. While ALE-Agent has often ranked highly in previous AHCs, AHC058 marks its first victory. Additionally, its calculated virtual rating is 2592, which corresponds to 66th place among active users.\n\nAVisualization of ALE-Agent’s past AHC performance and Rating. The graph shows the contribution of performance values from each contest to the overall rating. https://atcoder-graphs.vercel.app/#contributorGraph\n\nLooking ahead, we aim to increase stability to ensure consistently high performance across similar tasks and to evolve our agents to rival top experts in longer-term tasks lasting several days or more. To achieve this, we will focus on balancing efficient human-like thinking with trial and error (moving away from purely heavy LLM call reliance) and acquiring more advanced autonomous management capabilities.\n\nIn real-world problem-solving, the process where humans interpret, generalize, and refine the unexpected discoveries presented by AI is highly effective. As noted in our report on the ICFP Programming Contest 2025, Sakana AI positions AI not as a replacement for humans, but as a partner that expands human exploration capabilities. Measuring achievements by AI alone, as we did here, is vital for understanding the current strengths and weaknesses of AI as a partner, and we believe this result represents a significant milestone in that journey.\n\nFinally, we would like to express our deep gratitude to AtCoder Inc. for their continuous cooperation and to ALGO ARTIS CORPORATION for hosting this contest.\n\nSakana AI will continue to explore new possibilities for intelligence and the practical application of AI agents in the real world.\n\nSakana AI is looking for experienced software engineers to lead the productization of platforms that solve complex real-world problems and accelerate AI-driven discovery, including projects like ALE-Agent. We are also looking for interns interested in the further development and industrial application of AI agents. Join our team and help us turn cutting-edge AI agent technology into practical value.\n\nDetails and Application: https://sakana.ai/careers/",

    "fullText": "In most healthcare organizations, AI adoption didn't begin with a strategy document or a formal approval process.\n\nIt began organically with individuals hearing about how AI could help them do their jobs better, easier. Who doesn't want that? So, they start using AI tools to summarize notes, draft communications, interpret documents, or explore ideas faster. Often with good intentions. Often without visibility.\n\nWhether an organization has formally approved AI usage or not, the reality is the same: AI is already in the workflow.\n\nThe real question is no longer if employees are using AI.\n\nIt's whether that usage is intentional, governed, and defensible.\n\nMany organizations respond to AI risk in one of two ways:\n\nNeither approach reflects how work actually gets done.\n\nWhen tools are banned outright, usage tends to move underground.\n\nWhen policies exist without enforcement or structure, teams are left guessing where the boundaries really are.\n\nIn both cases, leadership loses visibility causing compliance risk to go up.\n\nThe most common AI risk in healthcare isn't malicious behavior or reckless intent.\n\nIt's the absence of a clear boundary between sensitive work and external AI systems.\n\nIn regulated environments, invisible usage is often riskier than visible, governed usage.\n\nA compliance gateway is not about surveillance.\n\nIt's not about monitoring individuals or second-guessing intent.\n\nA compliance gateway is an organizational control layer that sits between employees and AI systems, making AI usage:\n\nInstead of relying solely on policy documents or trust, organizations provide a clear, approved path for AI usage that aligns with regulatory obligations.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths about AI governance is that it slows teams down.\n\nThey spend less time guessing, self-censoring, or avoiding AI altogether.\n\nGovernance, when done well, becomes an enabler.\n\nHealthcare compliance is rarely about eliminating risk entirely.\n\nIt's about managing risk intentionally.\n\nOrganizations that struggle most with AI compliance are often not the ones using AI aggressively. They're the ones who can't see how it's being used at all.\n\nVisibility enables informed decision making, targeted controls, and credible explanations when questions arise.\n\nWithout visibility, even well-meaning organizations are forced to rely on hope.\n\nAs AI becomes embedded in everyday healthcare workflows, governance will increasingly shift:\n\nThe organizations that adapt successfully won't be the ones that stopped AI usage.\n\nThey'll be the ones that made it explicit, governed, and defensible.\n\nEmployees are already bringing AI into healthcare work because the incentives are real and the productivity gains are tangible.\n\nThe choice facing organizations isn't whether to allow AI.\n\nIt's whether AI usage will happen outside of governance or within it.\n\nGuardian Health is being built as a governed AI workbench for healthcare teams: designed to sit between employees and AI systems, making data handling decisions explicit, auditable, and defensible. Our focus is less on controlling behavior, and more on providing clear, compliant pathways for real-world AI usage.",

    "description": "The company's CEO said the ordeal has “been a difficult chapter.”",
    "fullText": "A well-known coffee brand has filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAs it turns out, its Compass Coffee.\n\nThe 25-unit chain based in the DMW market filed on Tuesday, and it’s all because of a lasting, “massive” impact leftover from the pandemic.\n\nWith a plan in place, the company intends to sell itself to “a strategic buyer with a substantial, global presence in the retail coffee business.”\n\nPlanning to file an asset purchase agreement, it will designate the buyer as the stalking horse bidder, which means the buyer sets the baseline that other bidders must beat, according to QSR.\n\nCompass will refuse the leases of 10 locations that aren’t producing profit, including its former headquarters and roastery, which is part of the bankruptcy.\n\nThe entirety of brand’s locations are based in Washington, D.C., Southern Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nCurrently, the company owes $11.7 million and has found itself sued by a number of landlords and venders over past due rent or other payments.\n\nComing to the aid of Compass is one of its investors – National Investment Group – which has committed to providing up to $450,000 in debtor-in-possession financing to help Compass fund bankruptcy restructuring costs and power through the sales process.\n\nBut the funds can’t be finalized until a judge signs off on it.\n\nAccording to what CEO and cofounder Michael Haft admitted in a LinkedIn post, the entire ordeal has “been a difficult chapter.”\n\n“The decisions we’re making reflect the reality of this moment in Washington and are about ensuring Compass can continue serving the city with the same real good coffee and sense of community that have defined us from the beginning.”\n\nIn court documents, Haft noted that the brand witnessed the “loss of considerable revenue” amid the pandemic as it was forced to downsize its workforce.\n\nCompass attempted to offset the loss of income by developing an in-house roastery and distribution business.\n\nBut things haven’t returned back to how it was before the pandemic due to fewer government employees and an increase of remote work in the area.\n\nThough some locations have stayed profitable, others are either “minimally profitable” or unprofitable. In order to slash costs, Compass came out of its coffee distribution business to focus on the main business of café’s.\n\n“Downtown was busy, people gathered in offices and cafés every day, and Compass grew alongside the city,” Haft said in his LinkedIn post.\n\n“That rhythm has changed in lasting ways since 2020. Foot traffic downtown has not returned, work patterns are different, and the economics of running urban cafés look very different than they did even a few years ago. Like many local restaurants and cafés, we reached a moment where we had to confront that reality honestly,” the post stated.",

    "title": "Despite getting flak for being woke and lazy, an exec at $62 billion giant Colgate says Gen Z workers are actually ‘pushing us to get better’",
    "description": "Sally Massey, the chief human resources officer at the $62 billion giant Colgate-Palmolive, is hitting back that young staffers aren’t the career sloths some typecast them to be.",
    "fullText": "Stereotypes stick, and some bosses have already made up their minds on Gen Z workers. Oscar-winning star Jodie Foster slammed the young staffers she encountered on the set of True Detective as “really annoying, especially in the workplace,” while fellow actress Whoopi Goldberg claimed that Gen Zers “only want to work four hours” yet expect to live in comfort.\n\nBut the chief human resources officer at $62 billion giant Colgate-Palmolive is hitting back that young staffers aren’t the career sloths some typecast them to be. Sally Massey credits Gen Z as being ambitious, and incredibly tech savvy—critical skills that the consumer products company behind Colgate toothpaste and Irish Spring soap is looking for in talent.\n\n“[Gen Z] have grown up with technology. They’ve grown up in a very different way than some of the other generations in the organization,” the CHRO tells Fortune.\n\n“They bring with them new ideas, new perspectives, curiosity,” Massey adds. “They’re pushing us to get better and to do things differently—I think it’s great.”\n\nMassey admits that Gen Z are bringing their own distinct “perspectives and expectations” to the workplace. And with 34,000 Colgate employees spread out among four generations, bridging the divide between age groups is especially daunting. So to ensure that everyone is working in harmony, the exec is revamping the usual chain of command; Colgate’s top leaders are hearing out entry-level staffers, stimulating the flow of ideas between ranks and generations to generate the best possible outcome.\n\n“We’re not siloed by generation or tenure, the senior leaders at Colgate want to hear ideas and thoughts from the more junior employees,” Massey says. “It’s how we get better, because as you get more senior, you can get further away. So it’s important for all of us to stay close, connected, and to learn from each other—regardless of the role.”\n\nMassey’s not alone. Not all employers have given up on hiring Gen Zers—despite headlines that suggest otherwise. In fact, many are still scoping out young talent with standout AI skills.\n\nEmily Glassberg Sands, Stripe’s head of data and AI, revealed she’s all-in on hiring recent graduates at the $91.5 billion financial services company. Just like Massey, she singled out Gen Z’s tech adaptability as one of the in-demand skills she’s looking for in Stripe employees.\n\n“I’m actually hiring more new grads—now, they’re largely new grad PhDs—but more new grads than ever before,” Glassberg Sands said on the Forward Future podcast last year. “Because they have the cutting edge skills, and they come in with fresh ideas, and they know how to think, and they know how to use the latest tools.”\n\nEven when young employees drive their bosses up the wall, CEOs are still embracing Gen Z as movers and shakers. Matt Huang, the cofounder of the $12 billion crypto investment firm Paradigm, is all too familiar with the temperament of young workers. The company’s first hire, then-19-year-old college dropout Charlie Noyes, once showed up five hours late to his first 10 a.m. meeting. The business has also embraced Gen Z-coded, unorthodox ways of choosing its top executives; Paradigm’s chief technology officer, Georgios Konstantopoulos, was discovered on a Discord server while he was still a teenager.\n\nHiring these innovative—albeit, sometimes finicky—Gen Zers may sound like a gamble for traditional workplaces. The Paradigm CEO admitted that the young staffers can come with drawbacks, but the value they generate is worth any havoc they wreak in the office.\n\n“They create an absurd amount of chaos sometimes and you want to pull your hair out,” Huang told Colossus Review last year. “But then you see what they can do and it’s like, holy crap. Nobody else in the world could do that.”\n\nEven the seasoned business experts teaching legions of Gen Z students are cutting in on criticism. Suzy Welch, a best-selling author and professor of management practice at New York University, hit back against those who brand the young generation lazy by reminiscing on her career journey. The baby boomer professor recalled having hope that she could one day be more successful than her parents—but for Gen Zers, that dream of prosperity is out of reach. Welch encouraged bosses to empathize with their unique job and economic vulnerabilities.\n\n“Gen Z [has] no reason to believe that they’re ever going to have economic security,” Welch said on a podcast last year. “I don’t know about you, but I’m old enough that when I was in college, I thought ‘For sure, I’m going to have more money than my parents.’ And that ‘If I work very very hard I’m going to buy a house someday,’ and this was the assumption.”\n\n“A lot of Gen Z [are] just saying ‘I’m not even sure we’re going to be alive in 20 years because of global warming,’” Welch continued. “And ‘The world is probably going to end anyway because of the stupidity of decisions your generations made.’”\n\nMillionaire podcaster and former CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins also came to Gen Z’s defense. In response to stereotypes that young people are anxious, addicted to social media, and lazy, she posed one question: “Have you stopped to consider what it’s like to be a twentysomething today?” Chances are if critics try and envision stepping into their shoes, they’ll be met with the harsh reality that Gen Zers are under immense stress and pressure that didn’t exist just five years ago.\n\n“The world is in chaos—and most twentysomethings had parents that lived in a very predictable, stable economy,” Robbins said in a TikTok video posted last year. “They went to a corporate job, they reported to the office, they had a network of friends at work. That’s not the typical 20-year-old experience.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "CNN’s Michael Smerconish couldn’t believe his eyes when reading a fan tweet live on air Saturday.\n\n“From [Rhode Island],” Smerconish began reading. “You are making it way too complicated. The rule should be, if you run from the police — What? Are you s***ting me?”\n\nHe continued, “If you run from the police, you’ll be shot. That should be the standard? Surely — Put that camera on me!”\n\nSmerconish repeated the tweet again.\n\n“Surely, you jest. Surely you — ‘If you run from the police, you’ll be shot,'” he said. “That’s the world in which you want to live?”\n\nSmerconish continued, “By the way, I’m a shoplifter. I’m a — I don’t know — a car thief, I’m a pickpocket artist, and the police happen upon the scene, and I run. And you want me shot without regard for any standard as to serious bodily harm or death being in play? No, that’s…there is a country for you and it’s behind an iron curtain. It’s probably a place where they would chop off your hand as well. That is nutty.”\n\nVice President JD Vance claimed on Thursday that the federal agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis mother Renee Good, was protected by “absolutely immunity.”\n\n“You have a federal law enforcement official engaging in federal law enforcement action — that’s a federal issue,” Vance said. “He is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job.”\n\nFederal agents do not, in fact, have absolute immunity. They have what’s called “Supremacy Clause immunity” that protects them from state criminal prosecution when they’re carrying out their official duties, provided their actions are “necessary and proper.”\n\nIt would be up to a court to determine whether ICE agent Jonathan Good’s actions met this standard when he shot Good multiple as she moved her vehicle after being instructed to exit.  Good’s last words to the agent were, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you.”\n\nA male voice can be heard on the scene calling her a “f**king bitch after shots were fired,” according to footage released to the public.\n\nThe Trump administration claimed that Good engaged in an act of “domestic terrorism” and hit Ross with her van.\n\nThe post ‘Are You Sh**ting Me?’ Smerconish Stunned By Viewer Saying ‘If You Run From The Police’ You’ll Be Shot first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nBurmese pythons achieved the near-total disappearance of 3 native species in the Florida Everglades.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons in the area.\n\n2005 field data counterintuitively confirm that a Burmese python can consume an entire American alligator.\n\nPythons utilize nest-raiding to win the battle before crocodiles ever reach the showdown.\n\nWho do you think would win a fight between a python and a crocodile in Florida?\n\nGenerally, we would look to real-life examples for clues, but surprisingly, there isn’t very much of that. While there are a few examples of pythons getting into it with alligators in Florida, they don’t seem to have many significant interactions with crocodiles.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we can’t wager a pretty good guess on our own, though. We can actually take a look at pythons and crocodiles in Florida and see who would emerge victorious in an encounter between them.\n\nThe Burmese python is not a native species in Florida. However, they are often found around the Everglades in South Florida. Native to Southeast Asia, Burmese pythons were first brought to the United States as exotic pets. Some pet owners ended up releasing the snakes into the wild, and the problem began.\n\nThe Burmese python is now considered to be a nuisance to the Everglades ecosystem, and for good reason. These pythons compete with native animals for food. They have also caused severe declines in many native species, including bobcats, opossums, and raccoons.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons.\n\nIn fact, they’ve even been known to eat alligators in some cases. In 2005, in the Florida Everglades, the body of a Burmese python was found with an American alligator in its stomach!\n\nThe American crocodile, or Crocodylus acutus, generally populate South Florida. This is the northern end of the crocodile’s range in most cases. They can be found in coves, ponds, and creeks in mangrove swamps, and they typically inhabit saltwater or brackish areas.\n\nFloridians will often see crocodiles basking in the sun. Because they’re ectothermic animals, they rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures.\n\nThey are the largest reptiles on earth and are said to be able to produce tears. They can’t chew their food, and to improve digestion, they have been known to swallow rocks. Crocodiles also have special hearts. Their hearts have four chambers just like humans do!\n\nShy and reclusive, they’re generally not a danger to people. If they’re approached by a person while basking in the sun, they’ll usually just quickly escape into the water.\n\nAmerican crocodiles typically eat small mammals, frogs, fish, turtles, and birds. Humans are the main threats to crocodiles because of habitat destruction and illegal hunting.\n\nCrocodile nests are also in danger due to predators, such as birds, crabs, and raccoons. In some cases, pythons will even eat alligator and crocodile eggs.\n\nPythons live in tropical areas of Asia and Africa. They can thrive in either wet or dry environments; however, they are freshwater and fully marine. They like it where it is hot and wet so their bodies can stay warm. They are usually found in rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, swamps, and shrubs.\n\nThese types of environments are home to many different creatures, such as the crocodile. That’s why these creatures are natural enemies because they share the same waters and wetlands.\n\nIf a Ball Python are able to survive adulthood, they can live about 10 to 15 years in the wild. However, the expected lifespan for a ball python living in captivity is around 30 years. Some, however, have been recorded to live over 50 years old when cared for properly.\n\nWhen predicting who would win in a battle between a python and a crocodile, we need to consider all of the factors. Knowledge of the physical features of both of these animals is very helpful in this process.\n\nPythons are often longer than crocodiles, reaching up to 26 feet long, while crocodiles usually aren’t more than 20 feet long. However, crocodiles do have the size advantage, as they tend to be much heavier. While a python is typically no more than about 200 pounds, a crocodile can be up to 2,000 pounds.\n\nCrocodiles have the size advantage over pythons.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles have the ability to stay submerged under water for stretches of time. However, crocodiles are much faster, being able to run up to about 25 miles per hour in some cases. Pythons only slither at about one mile per hour. Even if crocodiles can only run for short distances, they can easily catch up to a python in most cases.\n\nCrocodiles have the speed advantage over pythons.\n\nPythons do have the ability to use heat sensors and chemical receptors to stalk their prey. However, they typically have poor eyesight. Crocodiles have better eyesight and are able to see in the dark. They have strong senses of hearing and smell, as well as the ability to sense even subtle changes in pressure.\n\nCrocodiles have keener senses than pythons.\n\nPythons and crocodiles are both relatively large animals, although crocodiles are significantly larger. Pythons can camouflage themselves fairly effectively. Pythons and crocodiles both have the ability to submerge themselves underwater.\n\nIn terms of physical defenses, it’s a tie between pythons and crocodiles.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles are known for surprise attacks. Pythons have sharp teeth and the ability to constrict their prey with their bodies. Their bite is painful, but they’re not venomous, and it is not a strong enough bite to be fatal in most cases. Crocodiles, on the other hand, have the strongest bite ever seen in a living animal.\n\nGiven the vital stats of both competitors in this fight, we’d have to say that in an encounter between a python and a crocodile in Florida, the crocodile would probably be the winner.\n\nOf course, pythons are not completely powerless. If they’re able to get past a crocodile mother and eat crocodile eggs, they can prevent crocodiles from even getting to the fight in the first place.\n\nPythons can clearly hold their own, which is why they are so successful as an invasive species in Florida. But given the size and strength of the crocodile, it would likely be no contest between the two. Perhaps at some point, we’ll see evidence of crocodiles helping to control this invasive species.\n\nThe simple answer here is yes. The python lives in an aquatic type habitat and while swimming it is vulnerable to attack. This means that if a python is in the water, it is within perfect striking conditions for crocodiles. While younger snakes can be captured and eaten more easily by a crocodile of any size. The older python the larger it gets, so depending on the age of the snake the crocodile may not attack.\n\nThe post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "description": "The NFL Playoffs begin with six Wild Card games. We'll show you how to live stream every match-up online.",
    "fullText": "The NFL playoffs have arrived, and 12 teams will duke it out in Wild Card games for a shot at the Divisional round. We've gathered everything you need to know about where to watch NFL Wild Card games, including live streaming options.\n\nThe Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks earned first-round byes, but the other 12 teams to make it to the postseason will battle it out in one of six Wild Card games. The NFC will see Los Angeles Rams vs. Carolina Panthers, Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears, and San Francisco 49ers vs. Philadelphia Eagles showdowns. The AFC will feature Buffalo Bills vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Chargers vs. New England Patriots, and Houston Texans vs. Pittsburgh Steelers games.\n\nThe most notable omission in this year's postseason lineup is the Kansas City Chiefs, who haven't missed the playoffs in several years and made it all the way to the Super Bowl for five out of the six past seasons. The Chiefs faced a tricky couple of months and ultimately lost their star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, to a season-ending knee injury in mid-December.\n\nWhether the Eagles, the reigning champions, can go all the way again this year or whether there will be two fresh teams at Super Bowl LX remains to be seen. Keep reading to learn some of the best ways to tune into the Wild Card round, including global streaming options.\n\nThe NFL Wild Card games are spread across several networks and streaming services in the US, including Prime Video, CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN. Each network has its own streaming counterpart, which we'll dig into below, but if you're looking to watch every game (other than the streaming exclusive Prime Video match-up) in one place, then a live TV streaming service will be able to help you out.\n\nThe best live TV streaming service we've tested that carries CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN, in addition to other networks, is DirecTV. These channels are available in any of the streamer's Signature packages, but you can also find them in the DirecTV MySports genre pack. MySports carries around 20 popular sports channels and unlocks access to ESPN Unlimited. Local channels in genre packs sometimes vary by region, so it's a good idea to see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. MySports subscriptions cost $70 a month, while Signature plans start at $90 a month. DirecTV offers a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nDirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network.\n\nAs we mentioned above, the Packers vs. Bears game will be exclusive to Prime Video. Subscriptions start at $9 a month, but you also get Prime Video access with all Amazon Prime subscriptions, which cost $15 a month. New users can get a 30-day free trial.\n\nAmazon Prime Video is a capable, competitive streaming service that's more than just a Prime membership perk. You can also \n\nThe Bills vs. Jaguars game will be broadcast on CBS. Paramount Plus is CBS's streaming counterpart. The Premium tier ($13 a month) is typically needed to unlock CBS live streaming, but NFL games are also available with the Essential plans ($8 a month). New users can get a seven-day free trial.\n\nParamount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime.\n\nThe Chargers vs. Patriots game will air on NBC. Cord-cutters can live stream the game through Peacock. While you typically need Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month) to unlock NBC live streaming, you're able to watch NFL games with the Peacock Premium ($11 a month) tier.\n\nPeacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n\nThe Texans vs. Steelers game will air on both ESPN and ABC. ESPN's direct streaming counterpart is ESPN Unlimited, which costs $30 a month. While the cheaper ESPN Select tier unlocks some action, you'll need to opt for the Unlimited plan to watch this game.\n\nESPN Unlimited has everything from ESPN Plus, in addition to all that the ESPN linear networks have to offer.\n\nThe Rams vs. Panthers and 49ers vs. Eagles games will air on FOX. FOX's direct streaming counterpart is FOX One, which starts at $20 a month and comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nAll games will also be available through NFL Plus, where subscriptions start at $7 a month (or $15 a month for Premium). However, games are only available on mobile devices, like cell phones and tablets, so we recommend one of the above streaming services if you'd like to watch the games on a TV. There's also an opportunity to bundle NFL Plus Premium with ESPN Unlimited for $40 a month, a reduced rate compared to subscribing to each service separately.\n\nNFL fans in the UK and other regions can watch every game through DAZN's NFL Game Pass. Subscriptions prices vary by region and plan, but the streaming service will host the entirety of the NFL postseason, including the Super Bowl.\n\nDAZN is the home of NFL Game Pass International, the only service offering live and on-demand access to all NFL games in supported countries outside the United States and China.\n\nFootball fans don't need to worry about missing out on any of the action just because they're traveling away from home. Viewers can keep up with their usual websites and apps from anywhere with the help of a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs are easy-to-use tech tools that enable people to change their devices' virtual locations. This way, their usual services work from anywhere the same way they would back home. They're also strong ways to improve online security.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start, NordVPN is one of the best apps on the market. It's fast, user-friendly, and offers some solid security features. You can learn \n\nNordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs.\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

    "description": "I sent my husband and kids to visit family and spent the holidays alone, discovering how restorative intentional solitude can be.",
    "fullText": "When people asked me what I was doing for the holidays, I responded almost too giddily, \"I'm spending it alone.\" Their eyes narrowed, \"What?\"\n\nI told them I was sending my husband and the kids to his family in Massachusetts, and I'd stay back in Pennsylvania. All. By. Myself. I wouldn't have to answer to anyone or for anything. Not requests for snacks or one more backrub. I wouldn't have to sit rigid, wondering if one of my three kids was creeping out of a bed that wasn't theirs. Or defend my parenting style while my oldest yelled about how life wasn't fair and we must all really hate him, and why should he have to listen to anyone anyway.\n\nAfter a beat, every single mom (and a few dads) told me: \"I'm jealous. I want to do that. How did you swing that?\"\n\nThe decision to be alone during the holidays came slowly at first and then all at once. I'd hit a breaking point that most parents, especially moms, are all too familiar with. But the moment I toyed with the idea of staying back — in a quiet, clean, empty house — that was it. It was all I could think about.\n\nI broached the topic, gently, with my husband, who couldn't have been more supportive and emphatic. \"You should take a few days away!\" But I didn't want to be away. I wanted to be home alone. That was the key.\n\nAs the days ticked closer to The Big Departure, people asked me when Jeff and the kids were leaving. \"Wednesday, but I can't ask when, specifically,\" I'd laugh.\n\nI explained to the kids that I needed some alone time; I needed to take a break. They, who are 8, 5, and 3, were relatively unfazed. My middle, big-feeling daughter made me promise to call her every two minutes. I wanted them to know that it was OK for Mom (or Dad) to step away and be alone. It didn't mean I loved them any less. Something, something about distance making the heart grow fonder.\n\nMental health experts agree. Solitude can be a crucial form of self-care (unless it makes you truly uncomfortable to be totally alone). \"When you seek out intentional solitude, and the demands on your attention and focus melt away, it allows you to have a level of awareness that can support healing and growth,\" Emily Moriarty, M.Ed., a licensed professional counselor and director of clinical services at Reset Outdoors, told Business Insider.\n\nFinally, they were off. And I didn't know what to do with myself. Everything was weirdly quiet. Clean. Empty. I loved it. I had a couple of low-key plans over the next few days, but my goal was to savor the silence and the lack of a schedule.\n\nWhen 5 p.m. rolled around on the first night, I started making dinner while listening to music. I danced a little. I ate while reading a book. No one argued with me that they didn't like what was served. Cleanup was easy. I put my dishes away. I didn't need to sweep — I don't spill things on the floor.\n\nI turned my phone off; I didn't need an alarm. No one needed to reach me, and if they did, they could wait. Dad was more than capable. I slept in. I drank coffee on the couch in front of the fire in my pajamas. I forced myself to allow things to move slowly — something I have a hard time doing with or without kids.\n\n\"Solitude doesn't include sitting alone in an office working,\" Moriarty said. \"It has to be non-work, non-caregiving time.\"\n\nWhen it was time for the Big Holiday Meal, I thought I'd feel a little lonely. But I didn't, and that, I realized, was because this was my choice. I knew my family was enjoying themselves with relatives they don't often see and having a little vacation. And I knew that they'd all be home before I knew it.\n\nI'm sure that has more to do with the stark contrast of raising three kids, co-running a household, and having a (fairly successful) career, and four days of abrupt, near-total solitude. If I didn't have kids at all, I'm sure I wouldn't be bored at 7 p.m.\n\nPeople have since asked me if this will be my new holiday tradition. I did like it, maybe a bit too much, but it feels wrong to indefinitely celebrate the holidays without my kith and kin. Four days weren't enough to assuage Mom Guilt, apparently.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s southern Volgograd region, officials said Saturday, after Russia launched a powerful hypersonic missile along with drones and other weapons that disrupted Kyiv's power supply and heating.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties, Volgograd Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said Saturday it had struck the Zhutovskaya oil depot overnight. In a statement on Telegram, it said the depot is supplying fuel to Russian forces, adding that damage was being assessed.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nSaturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nStéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Friday's attacks “have resulted in significant civilian casualties and deprived millions of Ukrainians of essential services, including electricity, heating and water at a time of acute humanitarian need.”\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said heat supply would be fully restored in Kyiv by the end of Saturday.\n\nShe said areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River would gradually lift emergency blackouts and return to scheduled outages. But resuming power supply on the left bank, where Russian attacks were concentrated, is more complicated due to significant damage to the power grid, she added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down.\n\nSeparately, the Russian Defense Ministry said 59 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight over Russia and occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's military said that besides the oil depot in Volgograd, it had struck a drone storage facility belonging to a unit of Russia’s 19th Motor Rifle Division in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, as well as a drone command and control point near the eastern city of Pokrovsk.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "The commander summarized a recent, intense period of operations in an area where the proximity of Palestinian villages to Israeli communities complicates the challenges faced by the IDF.\n\nThe commander of the IDF’s Battalion 101 in the Paratroopers Brigade revealed the complexity involved in West Bank operations during an interview with Walla published on Friday.\n\nThe commander, referred to as Lt.-Col. R. summarized a recent, intense period of operations in an area where the proximity of Palestinian villages to Israeli communities is completely different from that faced by soldiers in Gaza or Lebanon.\n\nWhen asked what the greatest challenge for him in the sector was, he replied that “in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon, the sector boundaries are clear.”\n\n“You know what your vital assets are, you know what you need to defend, you know where the enemy is, and you know where you are,” he continued. “In the West Bank, how do you protect so many communities across such a large area?”\n\nHe added that as a battalion commander, he was responsible for a large sector of territory spanning 20 kilometers by 20 kilometers. “The nearest company commander from the battalion headquarters is 40 minutes away,” he said. “In Gaza, if your subordinate encounters terrorists, you’re with him within a minute. I was in many situations, and in the West Bank, it’s different. You have to protect many vital assets.”\n\nAccording to Lt.-Col. R., “it’s a challenge no less complex than attacking deep inside Lebanon.”\n\n“So how do you protect so many vital assets across such a large area? You need every force with you to conduct itself at the level of a battalion commander in the field. You have no other option - you must trust it. Think about the fact that even for a company commander, it can take 15 minutes to reach an incident in his sector.”\n\nOver the past two months, the battalion carried out four operations, during which two terrorists were killed, and 26 suspects involved in terrorist activity were arrested.\n\nIn addition, the battalion recently conducted an operation in which 40 wanted individuals were arrested overnight.\n\nIn another operation in the village of Kafr Aqab, Lt. Col. R. recounted that “an entire battalion walked four kilometers through the village. That demonstrated governance. It sent the message.”\n\nLt. Col. R. described another incident in which a terrorist attempted to carry out an attack in the settlement of Ateret. “The fighters were right near the entrance to the community. A patrol that rushed there within three minutes encountered the terrorist and killed him. Another terrorist tried to move up toward the farm - and he too was killed.”\n\nWhen asked how the West Bank sector looks now compared to past situations, and whether it is more or less volatile, Lt. Col. R. said that it is “not the West Bank [he] knew from the past.”\n\nElaborating on the changing atmosphere, he said that “entering the refugee camps of Balata, Askar, and Jenin today is not the same as it used to be. In the past, we would enter with large forces, and today, a force under the command of a squad leader or a platoon commander carries out arrests in the casbah of Nablus,” asserting that “today, the IDF has freedom of action.”",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMost lottery winners make a beeline for luxury real estate, buying up seven-bedroom mansions with koi ponds, glass walls, and garages that look like car museums. But one lucky Virginian with $155.6 million in their pocket decided to celebrate differently—with a lawn mower. Not just any lawn mower, either. A zero-turn riding mower. Call it humble. Call it hilarious. Either way, it's a far cry from the Hollywood Hills.\n\nThe anonymous winner of Virginia's largest-ever jackpot—a $348 million Mega Millions haul—walked into the state lottery office, cashed out with the lump sum, and made one wish known: they planned to mow their lawn in style. That's not exactly the plotline My Lottery Dream Home was built around. In fact, the entire HGTV show banks on winners going house-hunting for multimillion-dollar properties—mountaintop estates in Colorado, beachfront retreats in Florida, or swanky Texas compounds. Not pushin' a mower down the driveway.\n\nFor context, Edwin Castro, who won a record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot in California in 2022, spent a chunk of his cash on three mansions: a $25.5 million glass-box home in Hollywood Hills, a $4 million Zen-inspired retreat in Altadena, and a $47 million Bel Air estate complete with koi pond, naturally. That was all before he started stockpiling vintage Porsches. He may never touch a weed-whacker again.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' just opened a $0.85/share round — 10,000+ investors are already in.\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nBut this Virginia winner? They're bucking the cliché. And ironically, that low-key decision might be a smarter financial move than buying a $40 million mega-mansion with upkeep costs that chew through millions annually. Real estate is still a top-tier wealth-building tool—but owning it and living in it are two very different games.\n\nBut here's the twist: skipping the mansion might actually be the more financially sound move.\n\nHomeownership remains one of the most powerful ways to build wealth. According to the Federal Reserve's latest data, the median homeowner has 43 times more net worth than the median renter. That wealth gap isn't just about property value—it's also about stability, appreciation, and the ability to leverage equity.\n\nUnfortunately, homeownership has become a high-barrier dream for many. Mortgage rates are high, starter homes are scarce, and even modest properties come with hefty down payments, bidding wars, and monthly payments that rival luxury rents.",

McKee was booked into jail in Winnebago County in Illinois, shortly before noon local time. He will remain there until authorities extradite him back to Franklin County.\n\nIt's unclear if McKee has an attorney who can comment on his behalf.\n\nMonique Tepe, 39, and Spencer Tepe, 37, died on Dec. 30 after being found shot inside their home on the neighborhood in Weinland Park. The couple's two young children, both under the age of 5, were found physically unhurt inside the home.\n\nMore: Dentist's wife did not make tearful 911 call months before couple was found dead, police say\n\nColumbus homicide detectives identified McKee through neighborhood video surveillance, police alleged in court documents. They tracked the suspect \"to a vehicle which arrived just prior to the homicides and left shortly after.\" They found the vehicle in Rockford, Illinois, and found evidence that McKee had the vehicle before and after the killings.\n\nColumbus police have not publicly identified a potential motive in the couple's deaths.\n\nAround 9 a.m. on Dec. 30, coworkers of Spencer's from the dentistry office where he worked in Athens called Columbus police after Spencer did not show up for work and no one could reach Spencer or Monique by phone.\n\nAn officer went to do a well-being check but went to a home on Summit Street instead of the Tepe home, according to body camera footage released by Columbus police. About 40 minutes after that check, friends of the Tepes found them dead in their home.\n\nPolice have focused the investigation on the window of time between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on Dec. 30, which is when they believe the couple was killed. On Jan. 5, detectives released video from a security camera showing a person walking in an alley near the Tepes' home during that time frame, calling the person a \"person of interest.\"\n\nThe couple's fifth wedding anniversary would have been on Jan. 30.\n\n\"They were extraordinary people whose lives were filled with love, joy, and deep connection to others,\" the Tepe family told USA TODAY in a statement on Jan. 2.\n\nContributing: Melina Khan, Amanda Lee Myers\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Illinois man arrested for murder of ex-wife, Ohio dentist",

We've certainly done that,\" Parkinson said.\n\nThey did, and then some - beating top-flight opposition for the first time since 1999 to progress into round four.\n\nBut Wrexham are getting used to writing their own scripts.\n\n\"It's not just about the money, the fame and the people involved who have been amazing in the whole story, but to keep that edge and keep pushing as they're doing is tremendous,\" Dyche said.\n\nAnd, with a nod to Wrexham's position just outside the Championship play-offs, having been a non-league side as recently as 2023, he added: \"They might well add to the story.\"",

Ryan Elias found his target at the lineout and Macleod touched down from the maul.\n\nBut Pau once again silenced the sparse crowd with Tuipulotu crashing over and leaving his former side a mountain to climb.\n\nScarlets recovered from the disappointment of having a Henry Thomas try disallowed with another powerful maul, and there was no stopping Macleod once he got a sniff of a second.\n\nPau flanker Reece Hewat was shown a yellow card in the build-up, and with their tails up, Tom Rogers was quickest to pounce on a loose ball and chipped ahead for Hughes to win the foot race to the line.\n\nStill a man up after the break, Kemsley Mathias' outrageous step looked to have set up a try, but a TMO intervention showed the loose-head had been held up.\n\nScarlets kept coming and a powerful run by Plumtree broke the defensive line, and while he also looked to have been held up, the in-form flanker managed to wriggle free to ground the ball as Scarlets took the lead for the first time since the eighth minute.\n\nWith the crowd now behind them, Pau's discipline started to crumble and Hawkins finished off after the driving maul had done most of the damage.\n\nNathan Decron headed to the sin bin for an infringement, but Scarlets failed to take advantage as Pau demonstrated why they are currently the second best team in the Top 14.\n\nThey brought on their replacement forwards who made an instant impact, with prop Seneca taking advantage of some mis-communication in the defence to bust through.\n\nA careless Sam Lousi penalry gifted Pau a five metre lineout, with Attissogbe finding a gap to give his side the lead once more.\n\nFletcher Anderson looked to have come up with what could have been a winning try after Eddie James' pressure had won back possession, but the Scarlets number eight was stripped of the ball moments before grounding.\n\nLengthy replays added to the late drama, but Scarlets fans were left booing the final decision and it was Pau who finished with a flourish with well-taken tries from Attissogbe and Tokolahi.\n\nScarlets: Murray; Rogers, Roberts, James, Mee; Hawkins, Hughes; Mathias, Elias, Thomas, Lousi, Ball, Plumtree, Macleod (capt), Anderson.\n\nReplacements: Van der Merwe, Hepburn, O'Connor, Price, Davis, Blacker, Leggatt-Jones, Nicholas.\n\nPau: Attissogbe; Arfeuil, Decron, Valentino, Butlin; Desperes, Daubagna (capt); Etchebehere, Delhommel,Arrieta, Jolmes, Capelli, Zegueur, Hewat, Tuipulotu.\n\nReplacements: Rey, Seneca, Tokolahi, Liufau, Iosefo, Pelesasa, Robson, Mondinat.\n\nAssistants: Ian Kenny (Sco), Finlay Brown (Sco)\n\nSin bin: Hewat (34), Decron (50)",

With the line-out ball secured, Ene spun it wide to fellow wing O'Flaherty who ran in unopposed.\n\nJust as Sale looked like they were well on top, Sharks flanker Tshituka scored an excellent try, picking the ball from the base of a ruck and beating Ford all ends up before racing away to the line.\n\nBut the hosts hit back immediately through O'Flaherty who secured the try bonus point on 61 minutes, with the five points ensuring Sale's qualification and leaving the Sharks reliant on other results to stay in the Champions Cup.\n\nSale face a tough game at Toulouse next Saturday (17:30 GMT) which is likely to determine whether they have a home or away tie in the last 16, while the Sharks finish the pool stage with a home fixture against bottom side Clermont earlier on the same day (13:00).\n\nSale: Carpenter; Ene, Du Preez, Ma'asi-White, O'Flaherty; Ford, Warr; Rodd, Jibulu, Harper, Bamber, Van Rhyn (capt), Vermeulen, Dugdale, T Curry.\n\nReplacements: Caine, McIntyre, John, Burrow, Andrews, Hanson, Louw, Wehr.\n\nSharks: Kunene; Penxe, Venter, Julius, Malan; Masuku, Braude; Mazibuko, Swart, Koch, Rahl, Van Heerden, Mavesere, Tshituka, Hatton (capt).\n\nReplacements: Bester, Ganyane, Mdanda, Tshituka, Romao, Everson, Smith, Potgieter.\n\nAssistant referees: Adam Jones (Wal) and Ben Connor (Wal)",

I think when the team plays like that it becomes easier for the individual, but Antoine is settling well.\n\n\"He is a humble guy and we have followed him for a long time, but he brings something to the frontline - what we really want and what we need.\n\n\"He can attack quick, he wants to chase, he is a guy who doesn't stop. I think you see today that he can adapt quite quickly to our style. It's nice to have him with us.\"",

    "fullText": "No matter who is appointed Manchester United caretaker manager until the end of the season, Darren Fletcher has emerged as one of the big winners from a week of turmoil at Old Trafford.\n\nFletcher stepped up from his day-to-day role as United's under-18s coach to replace Ruben Amorim for the games against Burnley and Brighton.\n\nThe former United and Scotland midfielder is adamant he has looked no further than that and is relaxed about what comes next.\n\nHowever, Fletcher has made a hugely positive impression on United's powerbrokers.\n\nIt maybe should not be a surprise because that is exactly what happened when he came back to the club in October 2020, and then joined Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first-team coaching set-up in January 2021.\n\n\"I was surprised I got offered the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand, so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all.\n\n\"But I know that I can do it and I'm comfortable doing it.\n\n\"I know the environment, and I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years I've been here.\n\n\"I've had great experiences as a player, took my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now.\"\n\nFletcher has done a variety of jobs since his return to Old Trafford. He initially coached the under-16s before Solskjaer called on him, believing his \"winning mentality, commitment and hard work\" would be valuable in the culture he was trying to create.\n\nOnly two months later he was appointed United's first technical director, underlining the impact he was making.\n\nA senior United figure at the time said that limited period proved to be a \"good advert\" for Fletcher, as officials gained a greater understanding of his \"intelligence\".\n\nThey saw first-hand what they felt were key elements - a hunger, tremendous work ethic and thirst for knowledge.\n\nThese were elements of the elusive DNA United had been searching for - and still are in the wake of Amorim's exit.",

    "description": "Liam Rosenior does not see a need for drastic change at Chelsea - and that was part of the reason he was brought in.",
    "fullText": "New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior says he did \"nothing tactical, nothing technical\" before his first match against Charlton - a sign of the likely direction of travel under his leadership.\n\nThat is not to say the 41-year-old lacks innovation or the ability to nullify opponents, but his similarities to predecessor Enzo Maresca mean he does not need to reinvent the wheel.\n\nWhen asked by BBC Sport why he had not made any noticeable tactical changes before Chelsea's 5-1 victory in the FA Cup third round, Rosenior said: \"This is a team that won the Club World Cup. That was five months ago. This is a team that won the Conference League last year. We're a good team.\n\n\"We are a good team. They've been well coached. I've made no secret of that.\"\n\nRosenior was appointed to build on Maresca's work, knowing the way Chelsea play, having been part of their multi-club model at French club Strasbourg.\n\nHowever, that is not to say there have been no changes. Chelsea have struggled to retain leads this season, dropping 15 points from winning positions in the Premier League, winning just one of their past nine league matches.\n\n\"No, I think the biggest thing I challenged the players on was our reactions to setbacks, our intensity. I was very happy with the togetherness and the spirit of the group today,\" Rosenior added.\n\n\"I was very happy with the intensity that they ran at – winning duels, winning headers, all of the basics. And that's where you get your joy from.\"\n\nSources involved in Rosenior's first sessions say intensity was a key theme, one of the principles he hammered home in his first media conference, and something that has, at times, been a failing for Chelsea during long spells of ponderous possession.\n\nThey have also been vulnerable at set-pieces and again conceded when Miles Leaburn made it 2-1 in the second half at The Valley, before running out comfortable winners.\n\n\"We need to improve in that aspect as well – long throws, wide free-kicks, corners going into our box. They are the basics that I talk about in football,\" Rosenior explained.\n\nIt appears the system and style of play is low on Rosenior's to-do list, with so many matches to come, and such little time to prepare.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur's belated show of spirit may keep the wolf from head coach Thomas Frank's door a little longer, but a damaging FA Cup defeat reaffirms the lingering belief his time in charge is only heading one way.\n\nIf there is scant consolation for Frank after Spurs slumped to a 2-1 third-round loss at home to Aston Villa, it is that the mood at the end was nowhere near as ugly as it threatened to be at half-time.\n\nDig beneath that and - barring a trip to Fantasyland in which Spurs win the Champions League - the rest of this season is now a quest for respectability, and for Frank, survival.\n\nSpurs supporters sent their team off at the interval with deafening jeers ringing in their ears after they were brushed aside by a vastly superior Villa, who established a fully deserved 2-0 advantage.\n\nSuch was the lack of hope that thousands of seats inside the vast Tottenham Hotspur Stadium remained empty for even longer than usual at the start of the second half, fans resigned to Spurs' fate after a dismal first 45 minutes in which they conceded goals to Emiliano Buendia and Morgan Rogers.\n\nIt was deeply uncomfortable for Frank, who not only felt the full fury of the Spurs fans he is failing to convince, but also the taunts of thousands of travelling Villa supporters revelling in his misery.\n\nAs well as the time-honoured \"You're getting sacked in the morning\", he heard chants of \"Thomas Frank is an Arsenal fan\" after he was inadvertently pictured drinking from a Gunners-branded coffee cup before the Premier League defeat at Bournemouth.\n\nHelped by complacency from Villa, who came out for the second half looking like their work was done, Spurs at least competed and poured forward, with Wilson Odobert's 54th-minute goal offering a lifeline.\n\nThe stadium threw its support behind their team, who finally posed a threat, although too often it was frenzied rather than composed when opportunities arose.",
