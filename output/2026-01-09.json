    "description": "Exclusive interview: Dubois is aiming to add to her WBC title, fresh off a victory on the Paul vs Joshua undercard",
    "fullText": "Caroline Dubois is dialling up the pressure on Terri Harper in a bid to collect another world title.\n\nDubois took the next step in her career in December, signing with Jake Paul’s company Most Valuable Promotions (MVP) before fighting on the undercard of the YouTuber-turned-boxer’s loss to Anthony Joshua.\n\nAlso holding belts in the division are WBA champion Stephanie Han, IBF title-holder Elif Nur Turhan, and WBO champ Harper. And it’s Harper who is occupying the attention of her fellow Briton, Dubois.\n\n“I’ve been calling out Terri for a while now, and she would know that’s the fight I want,” Dubois, 24, told The Independent. “We’re both British fighters, we both represent the same things, we both have a belt, we’re both on the same platform and promotion, so it makes so much sense for us to fight next.\n\n“I’ve been calling for it for a while, you know? She just has to see that and make it happen. At the end of the day, I can’t drag anyone into the ring, I can’t force them to do anything. They have to agree to it, and that’s the amazing thing about boxing.\n\n“I imagine that from my side, I will be going 100 per cent for the Terri Harper fight. It’s just on her side to agree and accept.”\n\nDubois became WBC champion in December 2024, when Katie Taylor vacated the regular title. She has since retained the belt against Jessica Camara, against whom she drew, and Bo Mi Re Shin and Panatta – both of whom she outpointed.\n\nStill, the young Briton is highly touted and has not had the chance to test herself against the kind of names that fans and pundits desire. But Dubois is trying to find a balance of applying pressure and maintaining patience.\n\n“I believe what is for you is for you, and what isn’t for you is always gonna pass you by,” she said. “So, don’t rush it. I’m only 24, so there’s literally no rush. I know there are big fights on the horizon and I’m on the cusp now.\n\n“I can’t step back and continue fighting people that people don’t know. I have to step up and fight big names, I have to unify the division. I imagine that the big fights are coming, and when I say that, I mean next – names that people are really excited for. I genuinely feel that way.\n\n“I think there’s gonna be some really huge fights for women’s boxing, for boxing, and my name will be involved in that mix. So, I don’t feel any frustration or anything, I know it’s coming.”\n\nDubois’s win in December not only marked her debut under the MVP banner but also her US debut, as she took to the ring in Miami, Florida. Furthermore, the fight marked her debut on Netflix, which reportedly drew over 30m viewers for Paul’s sixth-round defeat by Joshua.\n\n“It was amazing to fight on that card,” Dubois said. “It was really cool, very surreal. [But] I’d say that, because I didn’t really know a lot of the fighters on the card, I was very good at focusing on my own fight, so it never overawed me or made me feel overwhelmed.\n\n“When I got out there, I kept expecting the weigh-in, the press conference, all of that stuff [to give me] an ‘oh, my God’ moment. But once I got there, it just became another day. I was relaxed.\n\n“I guess it comes from the fact that I fought on Sky Sports. I guess we underestimate how big a platform that is. I’ve fought on really big platforms, and that helped prep me for fighting on Netflix.”\n\nDubois’s deal with MVP, which follows her exit from Boxxer, could mean more US outings and fewer on home soil, but she said: “Potentially. I hope not. I hope I still have the opportunities to fight at home.\n\n“But I know MVP are not only trying to be an American promotion, they’re trying to branch out like the other massive promotions – Matchroom, Queensberry. I’m certain that they’ll do that; they’ve signed so many British fighters, it makes sense to do a show in England.”",

    "fullText": "Adekoya is a very tall (193cm) centre-back. The aspect of his game that stands-out immediately is his composure on the ball and his speed.\n\nIn possession he has excellent technical ability for a centre-back. He is a good carrier of the ball. Comfortable at carrying and passing the ball with both feet. In the 28 games available on Wyscout he attempted 27 dribbles for Burnley’s academy sides over the last two seasons and completed 24 of his attempts. This came out to an average of 1 dribble per 90 minutes and a completion rate of over 88%.\n\nBecause of his ability to use both feet comfortably, he can play as a right-sided and left-sided centre-back. He’s got long legs and is quite slim but muscular with a strong core, and as we mentioned above he’s quick so he deals well with physical challenges.\n\nTo illustrate, he won 74% of his 5.3 defensive duels per 90 and 78% of his 4.45 aerial duels per 90 for Burnley at youth level.\n\nThe only question mark is about his distribution of the ball. Burnley tend to play quite a direct style of football and do not keep a lot of possession, so he goes long often. He’s effective at doing this and has a nice range, but the sample size of him playing neater/line-breaking passes on the ground is a lot smaller. It’ll be interesting to see how this develops at Liverpool.",

    "fullText": "Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris has revealed that Wilson Isidor has trained with the squad ahead of their FA Cup tie against Everton.\n\nIsidor has been sidelined since featuring as a substitute in the Black Cats’ stalemate with Manchester City on New Year’s Day, but his involvement in first-team training has raised hopes of a possible return this weekend.\n\n“He is getting better,” Le Bris said.\n\n“He trained this morning with the squad and we’ll see if he is available or not.\n\n“Yes [he is touch-and-go], but we don’t want to take any unnecessary risks so we will see.”\n\nIn a demanding run that includes four games in nine days, Le Bris acknowledged that the cup tie could provide an opportunity to rotate his squad and give minutes to players who have featured less frequently.\n\n“New game, new energy,” he said. “We want to go strong, because we respect this competition.\n\n“At the same time, we will have to manage the load of a few players. At the minute, we don’t have the full picture, because the schedule is so busy so every hour is useful to understand exactly the situation.\n\n“We won’t take unnecessary risks, but we will select the best team possible, so we will see.”\n\nHowever, Le Bris admits that fatigue is a problem that has caused them trouble, having lost 3-0 to Brentford in the week, marking their first loss in over a month.\n\n“Regarding the game against Brentford, they were strong, first of all,” he said.\n\n“It was a tough challenge. They are in good form. I think until the penalty miss, it was still possible to manage the game. After that, the momentum swung and it was totally different. It could’ve been heavier at the end.\n\n“When you don’t take those moments, especially away from home, against a strong side, the league is relentless. We know that,” he continued.\n\n“So, fatigue, maybe, but it’s not an excuse. This was the case for Brentford as well. We are learning. It’s a tough league and it is still really important to experience those situations to grow.”",

It was the finish Miami worked toward all season, even when the path rarely felt smooth.\n\n“It was never easy. It was never perfect,” Beck said. “There were a lot of ups and downs.

    "fullText": "Why did Mario Cristobal leave Oregon? Revisiting 2021 decision that led to Dan Lanning hire originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMario Cristobal's fourth season at Miami saw him lead the Hurricanes to their first-ever College Football Playoff, an accomplishment that ignited a fan base desperate for a return to national relevance.\n\nCristobal, who played at Miami from 1989–1992, was previously the head coach at Oregon for five seasons before accepting the head coaching job in Coral Gables.\n\nIn his 15 years as a head coach, his tenure in Eugene marked his first and only coaching stop outside of South Florida.\n\nLet’s take a look back at Cristobal’s departure from Oregon, as well as his coaching career in Eugene.\n\nMORE: Why Miami doesn't have its own football stadium\n\nMario Cristobal was hired by Oregon before the 2018 season. He was previously on Ducks head coach Willie Taggart’s staff in 2017 and was named the interim head coach after Taggart left for Florida State. Just three days later, the school removed the interim tag and made him Oregon’s permanent head coach.\n\nPrior to joining Taggart’s staff, Cristobal was an assistant at Alabama from 2013-16 under Nick Saban. He was Florida International’s head coach from 2007-12, following nearly a decade as a collegiate assistant.\n\nCristobal was Oregon’s head coach from 2018-21. He enjoyed a successful run with the Ducks, with his best season coming in 2019. That year, Oregon finished 12-2, capped by a Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin. Following a 10-2 regular season in 2021, Cristobal surprisingly left to accept the head coaching job at Miami, which had just fired Manny Diaz.\n\nWhile the news shocked the Oregon fan base, Cristobal told ESPN’s Paul Finebaum he couldn’t turn down the opportunity to return to his alma mater.\n\n“Honestly, Paul, it was the most difficult decision I’ve ever had to make,” Cristobal said in Jan. 2022 via On3Sports. “It was grueling, it was very suddenly put on our family. It was difficult, but at the same time, a tremendous blessing. The x-factor being, more than it just being home, this is actually where I played. I wore this helmet, I wore this uniform. I have blood in this one, you know.\n\n\"We’ve got to feel good about the fact that when we arrived at Oregon, Oregon was 4-8,” Cristobal added.\n\n“And upon leaving, you’re looking at a team that has gone to 3-straight conference titles, won two of them. Won a Rose Bowl, 3-straight top ten picks. They are sitting on the most talent they have ever had there, so, it’s been left in a great place. They treated us great there. We are super grateful and thankful, but all focus is on Miami. We know what Miami is and why Miami does it right, so we are excited.”\n\nCristobal's playing and coaching career began at Miami. Cristobal was born in Miami, Fla., and played high school football at Christopher Columbus High School there. From 1989-1992, Cristobal played offensive line for the Canes under Hall of Fame coach Dennis Erickson. He was part of two national title teams in 1989 and 1991, and was named a First-Team All-Big East tackle during his 1992 season.\n\nMORE:Looking back at Oregon coach Dan Lanning’s little-discussed playing career\n\nCristobal finished with a 35-13 overall record at Oregon. He is currently the school’s seventh-winningest head coach, behind his successor Dan Lanning, Chip Kelly and Mike Bellotti.\n\nCristobal’s 2018 Ducks finished 9-4 during his first season — a year capped by a Redbox Bowl victory over Michigan State. He improved on that in 2019, leading Oregon to a Big Ten championship and Rose Bowl victory.\n\nDuring the shortened COVID-19 season in 2020, Oregon finished 4-3 while winning another Big Ten title. In 2021, the Ducks reached a third consecutive Big Ten title game but fell 38-10 to Utah to finish 10-2. Cristobal left for the Miami job a few days later.\n\nMORE: Looking back at the Alabama staff that produced Dan Lanning and a number of other big-name coaches\n\nCristobal earned a reputation as a strong recruiter throughout his career. While at Alabama in 2015, he was named the top recruiter in the country by 247Sports.\n\nHis reputation only grew in Oregon, where he successfully recruited three Top-10 NFL draft picks in Kayvon Thibodeaux (2022), Penei Sewell (2021) and Justin Herbert (2020). His 2019 class, which included Thibodeaux, finished ranked No. 7 in the country, and his 2021 class ranked sixth in the country per 247Sports.\n\nCristobal started his coaching career at his alma mater as a graduate assistant from 1998-2020. From there, he spent three seasons at Rutgers from 2001-2003, coaching both the offensive tackles and tight ends before moving to the offensive line in 2003.\n\nHe then returned to his alma mater, joining Larry Coker's staff at Miami from 2004-2006 as his tight ends coach. He was then hired as Florida International's head coach from 2007-2012, helping lead the Panthers to two straight bowl appearances in 2010 and 2011. His last season, FIU finished 3-9 in 2012, and was fired in Dec. 2022.\n\nHe was actually briefly hired by Miami in Jan. 2013 before joining Nick Saban's staff at Alabama, where he was named assistant head coach, offensive lines coach and recruiting coordinator six weeks later. He helped the Tide win the national title in 2015.\n\nFollowing his 35-13 record over his five seasons at Oregon, he landed back at his alma mater at Miami. Over four seasons, he has compiled a 34-18 record, with a first-ever CFP bid in 2025. Oregon, meanwhile, hired Dan Lanning to replace him. Lanning has gone 48-7 over four seasons, including back-to-back CFP berths. He is 96-78 overall as a head coach.\n\nMORE: What to know about Dan Lanning's wife's cancer diagnosis",

    "title": "Arsenal seemed to lose the summer signing battle - but could win the war",
    "description": "Liverpool spent big on flashy signings in the summer but cannot compete with the strength and depth of Arsenal’s bench",
    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta first turned to Myles Lewis-Skelly. Then he went to a double bill of Gabriels, with both Jesus and Martinelli. Next came Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze.\n\nThere were five substitutions before Liverpool’s first. Even that was enforced. Injury time proved a sadly accurate term as Conor Bradley was stretchered off and Joe Gomez came on.\n\nArsenal 0-0 Liverpool finished 5-1 in one respect: changes. “I think there are other things to talk about where both teams are at the moment than talking about the bench,” countered Arne Slot. The league table shows a 14-point gap and Slot cited a 20-goal difference in their respective set-piece balances, to borrow his term.\n\nBut champions and their probable successors have pursued different policies in their attempts to win the title. Liverpool were famously the biggest spenders, but Arsenal had the largest net spend. Slot got the flashiest signings. Arteta did not. Indeed, the last pair he brought on, Madueke and Eze, were summer arrivals but do not seem to figure in his first-choice side.\n\nHe filled out his squad, filled in every gap. It was the Polyfilla approach to winning the title, ensuring there were no cracks left in the group.\n\nThere was a case, reduced by their autumnal struggles and stumbles, to say that Liverpool had the strongest starting 11. It remains utterly uncontroversial to say that Arsenal have the best squad. No one else has quality in such depth. Arsenal, Slot had said the day before the stalemate at the Emirates, were a team with no obvious weaknesses. “The complete package,” he called them. Liverpool remain an incomplete package.\n\n“We showed that in the big games we are able to compete with any other team,” Slot argued; but Arsenal have competed with every team. Liverpool had their £450m refit but ended with a smaller squad than Arsenal and with at least three players, in Federico Chiesa, Rio Ngumoha and Wataru Endo, who Slot is reluctant to start in the Premier League.\n\nSlot fielded no striker at Arsenal, with Chiesa left unused. He has been down to two centre-backs for parts of the campaign, with Giovanni Leoni’s campaign curtailed and Gomez unfit at times. There have been times when he was without a specialist right-back. Recently, he had no out-and-out winger, Chiesa and Ngumoha apart. Liverpool did not follow Arteta’s model of two players for every position; sometimes they have not even had one.\n\nThey have been left with an overworked core. Apart from the Carabao Cup, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate have started every game this season. Apart from a one-game ban, Dominik Szoboszlai has only missed seven minutes. It has been just as well; even with them, Liverpool have felt short of players.\n\nMeanwhile, the sense that Arteta is prepared for every eventuality is underlined by the versatility of his players. None of Slot’s full-backs is particularly equipped to stand in as a centre-back. Three of Arteta’s, in Riccardo Calafiori, Jurrien Timber and Ben White, have spent part of their careers there. He has a midfielder, in Mikel Merino, who has flourished as a stand-in striker. The Spaniard scored home and away against Liverpool last season. He did not even make it off the bench on Thursday.\n\nThose options can justify Arteta’s policy of splitting his budget more ways, of signing four players each for £50m rather than bringing in two £100m men; one of Liverpool’s, in Alexander Isak, is injured and has been ineffective anyway.\n\nIt is no secret Arteta admired the Swede. He instead bought the cheaper, and distinctly limited Viktor Gyokeres. The theory was that he would be the final piece in the jigsaw; instead of winning the league because of the Swede, they may do so in spite of him. There are reasons to wonder if Gyokeres will soon be Arsenal’s fourth-choice centre-forward, even if, on form this season, Isak should be Liverpool’s second option, behind Hugo Ekitike, when each is fit.\n\nIn trying to build a title-winning side, Liverpool may have aimed for the highest ceiling, but Arsenal had the platform of the highest floor. Liverpool’s vision of a glorious attacking force, with Florian Wirtz as the creator in chief and Isak the scorer extraordinaire, may one day be realised; but even if so, it will not bring them Premier League glory this season.\n\nArsenal may have a more prosaic brand, a style that – with apologies to artists such as Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka – is based on efficiency. It has not brought much of a reward in two games against Liverpool; over 21 in a campaign, however, it has given them a six-point lead, and 14 ahead of Liverpool.\n\nAnd over a season, Arteta’s decision to prioritise strength in depth is justified by other markers. They top the second-half table, with most goals. They have 10 goal involvements from substitutes. They are alone among England’s Champions League representatives in going unbeaten in the Premier League games immediately after a European midweek.\n\nLiverpool could hold them over 90 minutes. Yet a glimpse at the benches, a sight of Freddie Woodman, Calvin Ramsay, Trey Nyoni and Ngumoha and the nine pedigree players Arteta had in reserve told a tale of where the title could be decided.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City turn to the FA Cup this weekend hoping the competition can provide a release from a frustrating run that has slowed their Premier League momentum.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side host League One opposition Exeter City knowing that domestic cup success may take on added importance given recent league results.\n\nCity arrive in the third round without a win in three matches, having been held to consecutive draws that have stalled their pursuit of high-flying Arsenal at the top of the table.\n\nThose dropped points have not damaged their position irreparably, but they have narrowed the margin for error in a title race that is beginning to stretch.\n\nThe FA Cup therefore offers both an opportunity and a warning, with progress expected but complacency punished ruthlessly in this competition.\n\nCity have been here before, using early-round ties to restore rhythm and confidence when league form has wavered.\n\nGuardiola will expect a sharp response after a sequence of performances that have promised control without delivering the decisive edge.\n\nInjuries and missed chances have played their part, but the feeling persists that City need a result to reset their season.\n\nThis fixture provides the clearest possible platform to do so, even if the opposition arrive with nothing to lose.\n\nExeter City travel to the Etihad as clear underdogs, backed by a sold-out away end and the familiar belief that the FA Cup can rewrite logic.\n\nThe League One side have lifted themselves away from immediate danger in recent weeks and arrive in improved spirits.\n\nTheir journey to this stage has been built on discipline and efficiency, qualities that will be tested relentlessly against elite opposition.\n\nExeter will know that surviving the opening phase would already represent progress, both on the pitch and in belief.\n\nGuardiola’s teams have traditionally treated the FA Cup seriously, reaching the latter stages with remarkable consistency.\n\nHowever, recent finals have ended in disappointment, sharpening the desire to go deeper this time around.\n\nWith other competitions demanding attention later in the month, City will want a professional performance that avoids drama.\n\nRotation is likely, but the expectation of control will remain non-negotiable.\n\nThe gap in resources and quality is vast, yet history offers enough reminders to prevent any sense of entitlement.\n\nEarly goals would settle nerves and allow City to impose structure and tempo.\n\nFailure to do so would invite anxiety and give Exeter a foothold they will gladly exploit.\n\nFor the visitors, the occasion alone is a reward, but the ambition will extend beyond participation.\n\nFor City, this is about restoring authority.\n\nIf they are to keep their season on track, it starts with treating this tie as more than a formality.",

First, let’s look at the current AFC playoff bracket.\n\nWild-Card Games\n(5) Houston Texans at (4) Pittsburgh Steelers\n(6) Buffalo Bills at (3) Jacksonville Jaguars\n(7) Los Angeles Chargers at (2) New England Patriots\n\nThe Jaguars, Texans and Steelers are New England’s only potential opponents in the divisional round.\n\nThe top-seeded Broncos, who won’t play this weekend, will host the lowest remaining seed in the next round. So, if the Patriots beat the seventh-seeded Chargers and the sixth-seeded Bills beat the third-seeded Jaguars, Buffalo will head to Denver for a divisional-round matchup. New England then would host the winner of the Texans-Steelers matchup.\n\nHowever, if the Jaguars beat the Bills, Jacksonville will visit New England in the divisional round, leaving the Broncos with either the Steelers or Texans.\n\nThe good news for the Patriots is that they wouldn’t have to deal with the Bills until the AFC Championship Game. And, if the goal is to avoid traveling to Denver for the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots should feel relatively confident that the Bills could upset the Broncos in the second round if they make it that far.\n\nHowever, the Jaguars and Texans are both dangerous, well-rounded opponents with strong defenses and capable offenses. The Steelers are considered the weak link in the AFC playoff field, but they beat the Patriots earlier this season and still have Aaron Rodgers at quarterback. Regardless, these are the playoffs, and nothing will be easy.\n\nThe Patriots and Chargers are scheduled to kick off from Gillette Stadium at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nMic’d-Up Mike Vrabel Trolls Stefon Diggs, Tells Patriots Star To ‘Shut The (Bleep) Up’",

So I'll support him to do that.\"\n\nDespite reports of negotiations with Celtic, Davies said: \"We've had no discussions at the moment about anything other than Kyogo giving his best and doing his best for Birmingham City.\n\n\"Personally, I think he's going to stay here and potentially battle through whatever comes in front of him.\"\n\nKyogo, who scored 85 goals in 165 appearances for Celtic, started the 3-0 defeat by Watford but was back to coming off the bench for the 3-2 defeat of leaders Coventry City at the weekend.\n\n\"Kyogo cannot be doing any \n\n\"Again though, like a lot of things, we'll obviously see as things progress through January where everyone is and make sure everyone is on the same page.\n\n\"But, certainly at this moment in time, Kyogo is an important player in the squad and will continue to be so.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Arsenal 0-0 Liverpool: Gabriel Martinelli’s moment of madness overshadowed another abject display from Gyokeres, whose form is becoming a problem for Arteta",
    "fullText": "Arsenal wanted a statement, but there won’t be much more said about this 0-0 draw with Liverpool at all – outside the controversy surrounding Gabriel Martinelli’s shameful moment. It was perhaps surprising that Arne Slot’s players didn’t respond with even greater fury after he pushed a clearly injured Conor Bradley off the pitch.\n\nIt was otherwise very much like the game in August, except without a moment of magic to settle it, or pretty much any creativity at all.\n\nAn otherwise great Christmas for Arsenal still ends up feeling, well, like a rainy midweek evening in January. The entire occasion involved a certain restlessness, but the home crowd can at least remind themselves that they are in a better position than they were a month ago, and a commanding six points clear.\n\nIt was just that Mikel Arteta’s side were too willing to cede control, in a game that will at least offer Slot some solace.\n\nThis was a third successive draw, but one that wasn’t like the others.\n\nIf Arsenal are to end up winning the title, they will have done so without actually beating last season’s champions in the league. Liverpool have claimed four points against them, out of two matches where the best you can say is that both showed each other an awful lot of respect. That’s despite constant murmurs that they don’t really like each other too much.\n\nPerhaps that was seen in Martinelli’s stunning intervention, but there’s absolutely no excuse for that. That could be one moment from this match that provokes further discussion – and a lot of controversy – but Slot did take the temperature out of it by almost speaking on the Brazilian’s behalf. The Liverpool manager said that time-wasting is a general problem in football and it should be understood that frustrated players might feel that every incident is such in the heat of the moment – even if this obviously wasn't.\n\n“You cannot expect Martinelli to think so clear in the 94th minute,” Slot said.\n\nLiverpool did enough to remind the world of their quality without actually showing it, while Arsenal weren’t allowed to play their game. Liverpool had most of the possession in the second half.\n\nUltimately, though, very little actually happened in a match from which everyone expected so much.\n\nAnd, for want of an actual discussion, it’s impossible not to say that more was by now expected of Viktor Gyokeres. It is a talking point.\n\nArsenal may still be in firm control of their destiny, but one of the lingering doubts is over the forward line, and what Arteta actually ends up deciding to do there.\n\nHow long will he keep faith with Gyokeres?\n\nThe recovering Gabriel Jesus is already a ball of energy any time he comes on, something that stands out all the more when it’s put in immediate contrast with the Swede’s relative sluggishness. Kai Havertz is, meanwhile, expected back on Sunday.\n\nThere’s even an argument that midfielder Mikel Merino is a more useful option right now.\n\nIt’s hard not to think that Gyokeres will soon be on the bench, which is probably better for Arsenal than five yards behind a ball that flashes across the box.\n\nThis isn’t to immediately dismiss the player. He’s clearly still adapting to the leap that the Premier League represents, and isn’t quite up to speed.\n\nIt is very much speed that is the issue, though.\n\nThere were three big moments in the first half, where you would have expected a striker of his profile to do everything to get there.\n\nOne was a Jurrien Timber head back. One was a Saka cut back. Another was a flashed Leandro Trossard ball across the box.\n\nYet, for each, Gyokeres ended up around five yards behind play.\n\nHe ended up going off on 64 minutes after making a mere eight touches.\n\nA bit more force for even one of those chances, and it could have been nine and a goal.\n\nFor Gyokeres’ part, he did offer one fine moment with a smart reverse pass for Timber. Arsenal didn’t even have another shot until the 90th minute, either, but that wasn’t completely down to the attacking options.\n\nArteta was evidently willing his team to be much more contained.\n\nThat was despite Liverpool not having much in attack themselves, which is much more explainable.\n\nThree of their attacking stars are out, and they ended up playing a forward up front who has occasionally filled in at left wing-back.\n\nLiverpool did begin to get control of the game in the second half, but couldn’t do much with it.\n\nThey didn’t have the individual creativity or the collective integration.\n\nFlorian Wirtz was often left looking frustrated near the area as another Liverpool attack went nowhere, and certainly not towards him.\n\nThis is maybe the greater concern for Slot. His team aren’t really building. They’re now too dependent on individual inspiration.\n\nThe difference in what Liverpool were and are could be seen in one set piece, albeit not from Arsenal. Back in August, Dominik Szoboszlai struck a 30-yard free-kick that flew into the top corner. Here, it flew into the crowd.\n\nWayward, indulged and not looking like anything it was expected to be: a bit like the team right now.\n\nHe did get closer with one that was nearer to the goal. Like so much in this match, though, it did not ultimately end with a shot on target.\n\nArsenal couldn’t even do that with one of their late set pieces, with the final whistle going just after Gabriel headed down and wide.",

Shoot, Josh Allen is the kind of human being who makes you believe.\n\nAnd maybe that's because the Buffalo Bills' superstar quarterback, the reigning MVP of the National Football League, has spent a whole lifetime making people believe.\n\nIt's a crucial trait for any QB, especially one about to try and lead the Bills on a road-centric journey toward the Super Bowl.\n\nBut because of who Allen is, and where he's come from, and what he's done, there isn't a single member of Bills Mafia who doubts for a second what number 17 is capable of.\n\nMORE: Steelers' DK Metcalf, back from suspension, is a monster in the playoffs\n\nThis is a guy who had no Division I scholarship offers out of Firebaugh High School in California.\n\nSo he headed to Reedley Community College, to make believers.\n\nIt wasn't easy work. Allen had to send hundreds of emails to Division I colleges to get interest beyond the JuCo level.\n\nWyoming gave him a shot, only after their preferred recruit, Eric Dungey, flipped to Syracuse.\n\nSo there Allen went to Laramie, to make more believers.\n\nEven there, with some of the most impressive highlights you'll ever see, it wasn't easy work.\n\nNFL teams really saw this and were like “yup, that’s the 3rd best QB in this draft”\n\npic.twitter.com/Q94NUgSUIt\n\n— Polymarket Football (@PolymarketBlitz) January 1, 2026\n\nDoubters pointed to Allen's interceptions and his completion percentage as bad signs.\n\nAllen ended up being the third quarterback off the board, behind Baker Mayfield (1) and Sam Darnold (3) but ahead of Rosen (10) and Lamar Jackson (32).\n\nAnd so then it was off to Western New York, to make believers one more time.\n\nThe thing about the Allen experience, of course, is that at each stop, you can be darn sure he has made those believers.\n\nThe people in the room with Allen? They buy in. They know who he is, and what he can do. In Firebaugh, believers. At Reedley CC, believers. At Wyoming, believers.\n\nIt's the outsiders that can take some convincing.\n\nOnce in Buffalo, though, he again evangelized. One hurdle, one pinpoint pass, one smile at a time, Allen showed Bills Mafia who he is, and once you see who Allen is, it's impossible not to believe in him.\n\nHe's got almost all the wins to show for it, too. And he probably deserved one or two of those playoff victories over the Chiefs, too, for his incredible heroics that somehow weren't enough.\n\nBut now, if you needed even one more reason to believe: The Chiefs aren't in the dance this time. Neither are the Ravens and Lamar Jackson, or the Bengals and Joe Burrow.\n\nMORE: A missed field goal changed everything for Mike Tomlin and John Harbaugh\n\nSure, the Bills had a choppy regular season that resulted in the 6-seed in the AFC and the end of their AFC East Division title streak.\n\nBut there isn't another team in the bracket that has Josh Allen.\n\nAfter the Bills' crazy come-from-behind win to start this season, 41-40 over the Ravens after trailing by 15 late in the fourth quarter, Allen implored those listening, \"Have a little faith.\"\n\nThere's a whole region of believers, ready to follow him to the top of the mountaintop.\n\nA priest played a part in the Steelers' miraculous win over the Ravens\n\nHarrison Smith nearly played QB before his retirement decision\n\nWe now know Lamar Jackson's role in John Harbaugh's firing\n\nFalcons would've gone to the playoffs if not for the New York Jets\n\nThe Colts ran a fake punt on first down\n\nTravis Kelce uses New Heights to share a major retirement update",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOregon has been a college football powerhouse for much of the 21st century, but the Ducks' history is much different than recent success indicates.\n\nUntil the calendar flipped to 2000, Oregon struggled to find national relevance. The Ducks didn't win more than nine games in a season until 2000, and but in this era, anything less than 10 wins would be seen as a major disappointment.\n\nWhat Oregon is hoping comes next is national championships, and the school believes it has the structure in place to compete for a title every year.\n\nHere's a look at Oregon football's best seasons and whether the program has won a national championship.\n\nMORE:Where Dante Moore lands in 2026 NFL mock draft\n\nOregon has never won a national championship. The Ducks do have an \"unclaimed\" national championship from 2024 because two NCAA selectors chose them as champions despite a College Football Playoff quarterfinal loss to Ohio State, but they don't recognize the title.\n\nIn reality, the closest Oregon has come to a national championship was 2010 and 2014. The Ducks reached the BCS title game under coach Chip Kelly in 2010, but they lost narrowly to Cam Newton and Auburn on the big stage.\n\nFour years later, Oregon entered the inaugural College Football Playoff as the No. 2 seed and played for a national championship after defeating reigning champion Florida State in the Rose Bowl. Despite entering as moderate favorites over No. 4 Ohio State, the Ducks suffered a 42-20 loss and missed their chance to finish Marcus Mariota's Heisman-winning season with the program's first national championship.\n\nOregon has reached the College Football Playoff three times. The Ducks made the first-ever playoff in 2014 but couldn't crack the final nine editions of the four-team bracket. Once the playoff expanded in 2024, Oregon entered as the No. 1 seed but was defeated by No. 8 Ohio State in the quarterfinal.\n\nIn 2025, the Ducks entered as the No. 5 seed and won their first two games of the tournament over James Madison and Texas Tech.\n\nMORE:Inside Alabama's loaded 2015 coaching staff featuring Dan Lanning\n\nHere are the 10 best seasons in Oregon history, by winning percentage:",

The Tigers filed at $19 million.\n\nThat's the widest gap in the history of MLB's arbitration process.\n\nMORE: Guardians take a step forward with Steven Kwan\n\nThe arbitration process determines the salaries for players in their fourth, fifth and sixth years of service time with a team in the major leagues.\n\nIf a team and player don't agree to a contract ahead of time, they go into arbitration, where the player and team each submit a value, kind of like a bid.\n\nThey each then go into a room and pitch their case, and at the end, an arbitrator picks which side has won, and that's the player's salary for the season ahead.\n\nSkubal will eventually be looking at the largest contract ever given to a pitcher.\n\nRight now, he's just trying to get fair compensation for his last season before free agency.\n\nThere's no way Skubal can appreciate the difference in opinion being this wide. The back-to-back AL Cy Young winner is as valuable as any pitcher in the sport not named Paul Skenes.\n\nIt's not clear whether this will lead to a change in the Skubal trade rumors or timeline.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor years, the Indiana Hoosiers were an afterthought in college football, known much more for their prowess in college basketball.\n\nThen, the program hired Curt Cignetti at head coach, turbocharging a dormant team to the level of the sport's biggest powers. Cignetti helped produce one of the biggest turnarounds in college football history, taking a team that was considered an afterthought to national championship contenders.\n\nBefore Cignetti and the NIL world helped get Indiana to the top of the college football world, the Hoosiers had their issues simply breaking through in the Big Ten. Here's a breakdown of Indiana's history in their quest to win a national championship.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal\n\nIndiana has been playing football since 1899, but the Hoosiers have never won a national championship in the sport. In fact, Indiana has only won the Big Ten three times in its history, most recently during the 2025 season.\n\nTherefore, Indiana's resurgence under Curt Cignetti is pretty remarkable considering Indiana's history. The Hoosiers only have two double-digit win seasons, both coming under Cignetti in 2024 and 2025, and the program only has four seasons with at least nine wins.\n\nIndiana has never won a national championship, and the Hoosiers have never really been close to winning one either. Previously, the best finishes for Indiana were a loss in the 1967 Rose Bowl and a loss in the first round of the 2024 College Football Playoff.\n\nIf the Hoosiers win the National Championship in 2026, it will be the first time since 1996 that the national champion is a first-time victory. That year, Florida won its first title under Steve Spurrier.\n\nThe Hoosiers have made the College Football Playoff twice in their history, and they came in back-to-back seasons. First, Indiana made it's CFP debut in 2024 as an at-large team, then the Hoosiers returned to the Playoff in 2025 as the Big Ten champion and the top seed in the entire tournament.\n\nThe 2024 Indiana team was Cignetti's first in Bloomington, and featured many players who were also on the 2025 team. Kurtis Rourke led the Hoosiers as the quarterback, producing over 3,000 passing yards, 29 touchdowns and just five interceptions before graduating at the end of the year.\n\nHere's a look at the best seasons in Indiana history by winning percentage.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana has always been known as a basketball school. Whether it's legendary coach Bob Knight, or the historic greats such as Larry Bird and Isiah Thomas. Basketball is what instantly comes to mind when people think of Indiana sports.\n\nHowever, the Curt Cignetti era is here for their football program. The man himself said it best, \"It's pretty simple, I win. Google me.\"\n\nWith Indiana football off to this successful start with Cignetti, there are plenty of eyeballs on the university.\n\nFans are familiar with the bulldog, wolverine, and buckeye. But what is a Hoosier?\n\nThe Sporting News explains the origin of the nickname and how long Indiana has used it.\n\nMORE: Curt Cignetti's best quotes at Indiana\n\nWhile the exact origin has been debated for decades, the best explanation is that \"Hoosier\" refers to a native or resident of the U.S. state of Indiana.\n\nIt is one of the oldest state nicknames, dating back to the 1800s. One of the more popular uses derives from a poet named John Finley. Finley was from Richmond and wrote a poem called \"The Hoosier's Nest.\"\n\nIn this poem, the term \"Hoosher\" is used to describe the qualities of the pioneers of Indiana. These qualities include friendliness, hard work, and self-reliance.\n\nIn 1848, Berlett's Dictionary of Americanisms defined the word \"Hoosier\" as \"a nickname given at the west, to natives of Indiana.\"\n\nThen, 169 years later, in 2017, the U.S. Government Publishing Office updated its style manual (a guide for language usage and publishing), which officially recognized residents of the state of Indiana as Hoosiers.\n\nMORE: How Hoosiers went from most losses in college football history to No. 1\n\nIndiana Athletics first adopted this nickname during the 1923 football season. This team called themselves the \"Scrapping Hoosiers,\" which was meant to highlight their aggressive play style.\n\nSince that season, Indiana has used the term \"Hoosiers\" for all of its sports programs.\n\nIndiana's mascot is Hoosier the Bison. In 2025, the mascot was brought back after a nearly 60-year absence from the university.\n\nThe bison is meant to connect the university to the state mammal. It also makes a direct link to the state's heritage and a strong connection to conservation.\n\nThe mascot was used from 1965 to 1969, then was cut from the university for several decades. After a push from the athletic department, Hoosier the Bison was brought back. The new mascot returned in August 2025.\n\nMORE: Curt Cignetti's complete coaching timeline, from D2 school to Indiana",

The 27-year-old has made just five appearances since joining in the summer, scoring once, and has not featured since October 23rd.\n\nFrustrated by his lack of playing time, Romain Faivre is keen to leave Saudi Arabia this month and relaunch his career back in France. The former Stade Brestois player remains a well-regarded attacking midfielder, capable of operating across the frontline, particularly on the right wing.\n\nTalks have already begun with Bournemouth, with negotiations centred on how much of Faivre’s salary would be covered by any prospective Ligue 1 suitor. Le Havre AC, currently 13th with 18 points after 17 matches, are hoping that sporting director Mathieu Bodmer can leverage the club’s relative stability to convince the player.\n\nThey face competition from AJ Auxerre, who sit 17th on 12 points, and bottom side FC Metz, also on 12 points.

    "fullText": "Niccolò Pisilli has played 330 minutes this season, including nearly 94 as a starter against Lecce.\n\nRoma are in dire straits, and after providing the assist for Artem Dovbyk against the Salento side, he’s looking to confirm his midfield role against Sassuolo.\n\nHe’ll start for the first time in front of his home fans, and in a time of need for Roma, the youth product, born and raised in a suburb of the capital with the Giallorossi colors at heart, certainly isn’t holding back.\n\nAgainst the Neroverdi, he’ll have another chance to convince Gian Piero Gasperini not to let him go.\n\n“He’s found little space at Roma thanks to the performances of Cristante, Koné, and El Aynaoui. I have a high regard for Pisilli. Perhaps, as with all young players, it would be better to play more. If someone can do that at Roma, that’s fine, but right now there’s no room,” Gasperini said of Pisilli on the eve of the match against Genoa.\n\nThe situation now, however, is different: the Moroccan is out, Manu Koné’s performances are declining because he has no replacements, and even Cristante, who will be suspended against Sassuolo, has had little or no rest this season.\n\nSeveral teams are ready to embrace Pisilli, most notably Daniele De Rossi’s Genoa, who would like to bring him back after his coaching stint at Roma, but in one of his latest outings, Gasperini himself has locked him down: “There are few alternatives, and his departure in January is unlikely.”\n\nAfter his performance against Lecce, Pisilli stated: “I haven’t played much, but I’ve grown by playing against top-level players.” These words reveal a certain maturity despite his young age.\n\nMore than ever, his destiny is in his hands, or rather, in his feet, and it’s not out of the question that, even with the return of El Aynaoui, Gasp might decide not to let go of the U21 international.\n\nDiscussions about a possible transfer have certainly been postponed until the end of January, and around Trigoria, his talent is not up for discussion: only a loan deal is possible.",

    "fullText": "Are Dante Moore and Dakorien Moore related? Explaining Oregon's QB-WR connection with same last name originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile watching an Oregon football game, viewers may have heard \"Dante Moore completes a pass to Dakorien Moore.\"\n\nThe two have connected on a pass 32 times this season, along with three touchdowns. It's natural to question whether the two are related, given that they share the same last name.\n\nAre the Ducks' QB and WR actually related?\n\nThe Sporting News covers all the details about Oregon's QB-WR duo sharing the same last name.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal\n\nDante and Dakorien Moore are not related in any way. However, it's reasonable to be confused not just because the two share the same last name, but also because they constantly joke that they are indeed family.\n\nTheir strong connection and evident chemistry on the field, along with their playful banter, totally suggest the two being related.\n\nOn top of this, Dante was a massive influence in getting Dakorien to commit to Oregon. All of these elements together quickly catch fans' attention, making it obvious they share the same last name, which can lead to confusion.\n\nYes, Dante Moore has an older brother and a sister. Moore was raised by a single father and credits his siblings for helping raise him as well.\n\nMoore claims his mentality comes from his dad, which sets him apart from his competitors. Oregon's offensive coordinator Will Stein agrees with this testimony and thinks the Ducks' offense reflects Moore's spirit.",

    "description": "Quantum computing has long promised transformative advances in data analysis, yet practical quantum machine learning has remained elusive due to fundamental obstacles such as a steep quantum cost for the loading of classical data and poor trainability of many quantum machine learning algorithms designed for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor.",

    "description": "Key learnings from building Baselime",
    "fullText": "I started Baselime, an observability startup, in October 2021. 2.5 years later we joined Cloudflare. I was a first-time solo founder and I made more mistakes than I could count.\n\nIn this post, I’m reflecting on my time leading Baselime. I believe it will resonate with technical founders currently building or considering building similar companies. It focuses on early-stage, pre- Product Market Fit (PMF) developer tooling or infrastructure startups. I’ll refrain from typical advice such as “build a strong team”, or “build something people want”, smarter people already wrote about this extensively.\n\nYour one and only mission as an early-stage founder is to find Product Market Fit as quickly as possible. Nothing else matters.\n\nIt’s extremely easy to focus on software architecture, clean code, tests, scalability, refactoring, etc.\n\nI can hear you thinking that your startup is different and you need scalability from day 1. You’re wrong. Your solution will evolve. Obviously, it’s easier to evolve if the foundations are solid, but that’s assuming the solid foundations you’re building are for the right thing. Your early thesis about the world is most likely incorrect and you’ll have to adjust.\n\nI spent too much time building the foundations for “Observability as Code”. Imagine the best parts of CloudFormation and Terraform for observability: a CLI and a state management backend. Developers write multiple YAML files (with variables, interpolation, templates, etc.), the CLI combines them into a giant JSON file, uploads it to the backend which decides which resources (alerts, queries, dashboards, etc.) to create, edit or delete and the order of those operations.\n\nDespite all the hours spent building, refining and improving this, nobody cared. I was more concerned about building an elegant solution than actually finding PMF. Don’t do this.\n\nInstead, iterate fast, measure the result of your experiments, and if something doesn’t work, throw it away and move on quickly. When you find what works, you’ll refactor and improve.\n\nIt’s common startup wisdom that your solution should be better, faster, cheaper than the competition. Whilst there’s truth in this statement, in 2024 this is not enough anymore. Incumbents in the developer tools space iterate fast, and there are 5 new startups going after your market every quarter.\n\nInstead, look for technological shifts and focus your efforts where you’re a monopoly, rather than competing.\n\nI started Baselime with a focus on observability for AWS Lambda. There was a consensus among our early users that Baselime was better, faster and cheaper than the competition. But this wasn’t enough to stand out in a crowded space.\n\nUntil I noticed a massive segment where we could be a monopoly: the new developer platforms such as Cloudflare, Vercel, Fly.io, Koyeb, Render, etc.\n\nWithin 1 week, we built a Vercel integration and instantly doubled our weekly active users. Likewise for our Cloudflare integration.\n\nIf something is not growing fast, drop it quickly and work on something else. There are no points for stubbornness, you’re in a race against running out of money before PMF.\n\nIn April 2023, I spoke with the Cloudflare team about observability on the Workers platform, but we built our Cloudflare integration only 6 months later. It actually took only 1 week to build it.\n\nWhy wait 6 months to build something so obvious? 6 months is an eternity for an early-stage startup.\n\nDuring this time, I pretended to “focus on a single problem” to justify being stubborn on becoming the best observability platform for AWS Lambda. I ignored all market signals, both from developers and market research, telling me to shift my focus to an adjacent problem. Don’t do this.\n\nWe’re developers, we want to automate everything. But sometimes you’ve got to roll up your sleeves and do the tedious, unsexy but necessary work to grow.\n\nWe built sales automation and lead generation pipelines, but nothing worked. Our user growth was flat. Until I decided to ignore all the best practices and do what works for me, something I’ll actually enjoy: personally message every developer with a slight interest in cloud computing I could find on Twitter. It was unglamorous, tedious, and monotonous, but it had to be done. This directly translated to signups, sales and referrals.\n\nI should have done this months earlier.\n\nIf you build it, they won’t come. You must create hype around your product. Technical founders tend to view hype as a bad thing, used to sell snake oil.\n\nWhen in fact, hype is a cheat code to get in the public awareness. Get developers to know your solution exists, its benefits and its limitations. It doesn’t matter if they don’t Eventually (hopefully in the near future) they, or someone they know, will need to solve your problem and your solution should be the first they consider. Hype will get you there faster.\n\nyou thought we were done?\n\ndistributed tracing for @CloudflareDev with multi-cloud support \n\n- automatic correlation between logs and traces\n- support for workers, kv, durable objects, queues\n- all powered by the @baselimehq query engine\n\nand this design 😍✨\n\nmy dms are open if… pic.twitter.com/KcLZSr4DQP\n\nI love building software. It’s my main hobby. But building Baselime meant I didn’t have a hobby anymore. I didn’t have space to do this thing I love without the pressure of solving a problem for developers.\n\nI kept shipping every day, but there are days I actually despised building software, I didn’t want to build software but I had to.\n\nGet a side project, where you can explore and build whatever random useless thing you want. Your overall happiness levels will thank you - building a startup is hard enough, don’t go through it without hobbies :)\n\nIf you thought starting a company is hard, try selling one.\n\nBaselime was a pretty simple business when we joined Cloudflare. Just a few employees and our main assets were our IP. However, it still took quite a bit of work, from the negotiations phase to all the accounting and legal work involved.\n\nThe most difficult part was how nerve wracking it all was. I was a solo-founder and until Baselime, the most complex contracts I ever signed were tenancy agreements.\n\nAfter 2 years of building and selling, Baselime was part of my identity. The reality of joining a larger organisation was challenging. Thankfully a few trusted advisors truly supported me throughout the process. Joining Cloudflare was the best decision to achieve our vision: enabling every developer to resolve issues before they become problems.\n\nThe Baselime journey taught me much more than these highlights. I’m always keen to connect with dev tool founders and aspiring founders. Hit me up, my dms are open :)",

    "fullText": "A significant chunk of Chinese copper demand has all but evaporated after the metal’s stunning surge to record levels.\n\nCopper on the London Metal Exchange burst through $13,000 a ton for the first time this week, extending its rally to nearly 50% over the past year. A cocktail of bullish factors could drive prices even higher over the short term. While real-world buyers typically take time to adjust to such sharp increases, what’s notable in this case is the extent to which industrial users in the biggest market are scaling back purchases.\n\nNYC Fights Sale of Bankrupt Rentals After Mamdani Blasts Living Conditions\n\nNew Design Plans Revealed for White House Ballroom\n\nWe Still Don’t Know if Robotaxis Are Safer Than Human Drivers\n\nNew LA Home Designs, Reimagined By Fire\n\nSlowing the Spread of Urban Fires Starts Right Outside the Home\n\n“It is surprising how much price rejection is taking place. The Chinese are just not buying copper, it’s true,” Kostas Bintas, head of metals at trading giant Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., said in an interview. “But it’s finite — at some point you need to buy.”\n\nSluggish physical demand contrasts with the speculative frenzy lifting futures markets, where deep-pocketed funds are responding to tighter global supply, favorable interest rates and an impulse to hedge geopolitical turmoil by stockpiling commodities. The copper contract in Shanghai, which accounts for import costs, topped 100,000 yuan a ton ($14,300) for the first time at the end of December.\n\nChinese industry, though, accounts for half of global copper demand. The fabricators that shape the metal — into wires, sheets and pipes for power cables, circuit boards and plumbing systems — are struggling to pass on their higher costs to factories. As inventories build, the smelters that refine copper in the first instance are trying to export their surplus.\n\nRecord copper prices “had a significant impact in December,” said Hai Jianxun, a sales executive at Henan Yuxing Copper Co. in central China, which makes pipes for items like air-conditioners. “The overall market was very quiet — much quieter than in previous years.”\n\nA Mysteel Global survey covering most suppliers showed that about 60% of the firms making copper rod for electricity transmission, a category that accounts for around half of China’s copper goods, cut or shut production over the month because of mounting costs.\n\nFees to process refined copper into rod fell to zero this week, Mysteel said, the lowest-ever level for the time of the year.\n\nThe subdued activity isn’t an anomaly. Even during the autumn, when demand typically peaks, operating rates across fabricators were at multiyear lows for the season. Ultimately, the market is paying the price of the economy’s lackluster recovery from the pandemic and structurally weaker growth.",

The company is advancing projects involving germanium and gallium, metals used in semiconductors, defense systems, and advanced electronics.\n\nÓlafsson told Bloomberg he understands Trump's interest in Greenland, but added that people on the ground \"don't like the rhetoric or the language.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said the heightened attention has opened opportunities for investment in a region where infrastructure and logistics remain major challenges.\n\n\"It's really important that the Nordics and the US work together with Greenland. In the end, Greenland makes the decision. We are a Greenland-focused company and work in its interests, but these interests need to align for things to work,\" he told Bloomberg.",

    "title": "The military is running out of teenagers to recruit — and old-school methods to reach them are failing",
    "description": "The military faces a new recruiting crisis as America's teen population shrinks and outreach methods fail. The Pentagon is rethinking its playbook.",
    "fullText": "Military recruiting is on the upswing, but many recruiters say it's never been harder to get young people interested in service.\n\nPhone lists of numbers that once rang a family landline now dead-end at parents' cellphones. School access can vary from one street to the next. And while a direct message might be the fastest way to reach an overly online 17-year-old, finding the right social media handle can feel like chasing ghosts. The hunt has become so grueling that the time it takes to meet quotas of up to two recruits a month is pushing some recruiters into burnout territory.\n\nThese are some of the frustrations Business Insider heard while speaking to nearly four dozen Marine recruiters, leaders, and other officials for a four-part series on recruiter welfare.\n\nThe hunt for solutions is on, and legislation and use of artificial intelligence could be on the horizon.\n\nThe Pentagon is facing steep declines in young Americans' propensity and fitness to serve and public confidence in the military, long one of the government's most-trusted institutions, according to public polling.\n\nBoosting young Americans' interest in service, and reaching them in the first place, will require more than traditional military recruiting efforts, those involved agree. Political momentum for broader measures is already building.\n\nProject 2025, the conservative policy blueprint, outlines a major expansion of recruiting in schools: increased access for recruiters, more Junior ROTC programs, and a requirement that federally funded schools administer the military entrance exam. An effort to provide recruiters with improved access to high schools was included in the national defense spending bill signed into law in December.\n\nThe office of the defense secretary, which did not respond to a request for comment, recently established a new Recruitment Task Force. The Corps' Recruiting Command, which is part of the task force, is seeking legislative changes to help \"improve the student data collected in support of recruiting,\" a Marine spokesman told Business Insider.\n\nExperts are pressing for urgent solutions as population shifts reduce pools of young people eligible for the military.\n\n\"The coming declining birth rate challenge is so pronounced, even if the services were doing everything right to get to our current requirements, the math is just going to change,\" said Kate Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security and author of a recent report on recruiting.\n\nOver the next 16 years, the total number of children turning 18 is expected to fall by 700,000, representing a 13% drop, according to Kuzminski's research.\n\n\"Recruiters' jobs are going to be made a lot more difficult by this generational decline,\" Kuzminski said. Soon, they'll be forced to contend with capturing a larger percentage of American youth than ever before to meet the same end-strength requirements.\n\nAs recruiting pools narrow, the Army and Navy have found a way to turn otherwise unqualified young people into fit recruits, with new pre-boot camp preparatory courses to help applicants raise test scores or lose weight to meet military fitness standards.\n\nThe approach has helped dramatically boost enlistments. But the effort has drawn scrutiny over whether those services are accepting too many low-scoring applicants.\n\n\"The things that have worked up until now are not going to work in the future,\" Kuzminski said of recruiting.\n\nFor now, Marines still find new recruits by canvassing malls, attending community events, visiting schools, messaging social media accounts, and making dozens of phone calls that often reach a parent who isn't thrilled about the idea of their child joining the military.\n\nHigh schools that receive federal funding are legally required to allow recruiters access to grounds for pitches to classrooms or career fairs. But several recruiters said access isn't uniformly offered, and can hinge on the relationships recruiters foster with educators.\n\nA Marine recruiting official said geography can play a role and that some areas in the Northeast are known for more regularly keeping out recruiters.\n\nMore than half a dozen recruiters said conservative or rural areas aren't necessarily more welcoming, either. In their view, new enlistees are rarely motivated by politics; they're drawn by purpose, belonging, and the promise of financial stability.\n\nEven in places where \"support the troops\" is a common refrain, recruiters said, many parents resist the idea of their children joining the military.\n\nAnother factor: With fewer Americans personally connected to the armed forces, interest in enlisting has waned. A dwindling veteran population means fewer role models to inspire the next generation, and after two decades of the Global War on Terror, some veterans discourage their own children from serving.\n\nRecruiters say this reflects a growing divide between the military and civilian America — and a misunderstanding of what daily military life can entail — not just heroic Navy SEALs, or Top Gun pilots, but also equipment maintenance, human resources management, and mundane planning for those holding senior ranks.\n\nThe result of this divide, recruiters said, isn't just apathy. Three recruiters told Business Insider they've had guns pulled on them when visiting homes. One, who remains on active duty, recalled being called a \"baby killer\" and a \"slave\" to the government by an irate parent.\n\nAs phone lists falter and school access remains inconsistent — problems compounded by falling US birth rates and shrinking pools of potential recruits — recruiters are trying to meet teens where they already are: online. Social media has become a routine part of the job; artificial intelligence, meanwhile, is only beginning to surface as a potential tool.\n\nMany recruiters already use social media to connect with young people, though with varying results. Earlier this year, the Army tried partnering with influencers already in uniform to pique interest in enlistment, an effort that was halted after running into legal hurdles.\n\nWhen it comes to contacting prospective recruits through social media, some recruiters say it can feel inappropriate, acutely aware of past misconduct cases and wary of how easily online interactions can blur boundaries.\n\nAt the same time, the military's ties with Big Tech are deepening and opening new doors. A handful of leaders from Silicon Valley, including executives from Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI, were commissioned into the US Army Reserve earlier this year. It's part of a larger Army transformation effort to prepare the service for future conflicts, which some defense experts have said will require help from Silicon Valley.\n\nIn building the manpower for the future fight, leaning on emerging technology and, particularly, artificial intelligence could help recruiters identify and contact young people who may be predisposed to service, such as athletes, gamers, or those interested in science, technology, engineering, and math fields, said retired Marine Col. Bill Gray, who led recruiting efforts across the Southeast from 2018 to 2021.\n\nRecruiting has long been one of the military's toughest jobs, and when it tanks, Gray said, the answer has long been to expect recruiters to work harder, an idea that he said feels out of date with emerging technologies.\n\nOne fix, he said, could be giving recruiters access to contact information that's publicly available but not easily accessible. He recalled once watching recruiters flip through physical copies of high school yearbooks to zero in on star athletes and other standout students, a time-suck.\n\n\"It's mind-boggling to me that we are even having this conversation because of the time that could be saved,\" he said. \"You could be processing at machine speed instead of one-human speed.\"\n\nWithout a draft, increased face time with prospective recruits would be critical if the nation were to enter a large-scale war, said one senior Marine official familiar with recruiting demands who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile AI tools have the potential to make connecting with recruits easier, the official said that effort could run up against federal laws restricting the military's ability to collect or analyze data about US citizens.\n\n\"We are recruiting children,\" the official said. \"It's good that it's hard for our recruiters to find children who want to join. It should not be easy.\"\n\n\"There's a reluctance to go down some of these paths,\" Gray, the retired colonel, said. \"People say, 'Well, we're making mission, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Some recruiters say the system is breaking them — putting them under stress and threatening to derail their military careers.\n\n\"You could make life so much easier for those guys and gals,\" Gray said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The House passed a bipartisan package of three spending bills on Thursday that would fund parts of the federal government through September, demonstrating the eagerness of lawmakers to avoid another government shutdown near the end of the month.\n\nCongress has so far passed only three of the 12 annual spending bills that fund federal agencies for the current fiscal year. Failure to pass the remainder before a Jan. 30th deadline risks another shutdown just weeks after the record-setting, 43-day shutdown that occurred late last year.\n\nLeaders from both parties endorsed the latest measure, signaling that passage is likely in the Senate as well, belatedly getting Congress halfway home in completing their work on this year's spending bills. The White House also has endorsed the measure, calling it a “fiscally responsible bill.”\n\nThe package covers such agencies as the Interior Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Departments of Commerce and Justice. It passed by an overwhelming vote of 397-28, an unusual display of unity when it comes to government spending.\n\nThe price tag of the bills, which Republicans put at roughly $175 billion, comes in below current levels, generating savings for taxpayers, GOP lawmakers said. Democrats countered that they were able to negotiate spending levels far above what the Trump administration had requested and removed scores of policy riders that they say would have weakened gun safety regulations, expanded oil and gas leasing on federal lands and took aim at LGBTQ and racial equity policies.\n\nImportantly, Democrats said, the measure also includes legally binding spending requirements that restrain the White House's ability to withhold or delay funds for programs Trump opposes. Trump's first year in office was met with scores of lawsuits from states, cities and nonprofits who accused the administration of undertaking unlawful power grabs.\n\n“This legislation is a forceful rejection of draconian cuts to public services proposed by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe Senate would also have to pass the measure before President Donald Trump could sign it into law. But the bill has bipartisan backing in that chamber, too.\n\n“Republicans are strongest when we stay focused, Democrats are more effective when they negotiate in good faith, and the country is better off when Republicans and Democrats work together,” Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in urging colleagues to vote for the bill.\n\nFunding work is well behind schedule\n\nIn recent years, Congress has generally lumped all the spending bills into one or two measures, often voted on before lawmakers left Washington for the holidays. Lawmakers say such a process makes it easier to include provisions that couldn't pass muster on their own.\n\nJohnson has called for returning to a time when Congress takes up the 12 spending bills separately, though he's finding it easier said than done. The fiscal year began Oct. 1 and Congress is still debating full-year funding for most federal agencies.\n\nDemocrats listed various priorities they were able to maintain or increase funding for, despite the administration's opposition. For example, a program to make homes more energy efficient for low-income Americans got a $3 million boost, instead of being eliminated as proposed by Trump. The EPA, a frequent Trump target, gets $8.8 billion. That's more than double what Trump sought.\n\nRepublicans had voiced concerns about some earmarks in the bill, now called community funding projects. To ease those concerns, a nearly $1.5 million earmark obtained by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was removed from the bill. It would have funded a Somali-led organization's efforts to provide job training and peer support services for those struggling with addiction.\n\nRepublicans have been intensely focused on allegations of fraud by day care centers run by Somali residents. Those allegations are still being investigated. Omar has urged people not to blame an entire community for the actions of a relative few.",

    "fullText": "Some of Cursor's most important AI features didn't come from a formal road map. One was built over Thanksgiving, says its engineering head.\n\nJason Ginsberg said in an episode of the \"LangChain\" podcast published Thursday that a bottom-up approach has shaped several of Cursor's core capabilities.\n\nGinsberg said he built a debugging feature over the Thanksgiving holiday simply because he wanted it and to \"help people on the team.\" The AI-coding company has since launched its \"Debug Mode.\"\n\n\"If there's internal adoption, that's kind of our metric for this is ready to ship,\" he said.\n\nThe same pattern applies to Cursor's agent, now one of its defining features. Ginsberg said it was originally prototyped by a single engineer, as others on the team were skeptical.\n\n\"He prototyped it super quickly, and everyone's like, 'Oh wow, this works,'\" Ginsberg said.\n\nCursor still maintains short-term roadmaps, but many of its biggest features emerge organically, Ginsberg said.\n\nHe also said there isn't much formal process at Cursor. Instead of debating product changes in documents or alignment meetings, engineers resolve disagreements through code.\n\nCursor is among the most prominent AI companies being built by a tiny team.\n\nGinsberg said on the podcast that Cursor had about 20 people at the start of 2025.\n\n\"That was because the process to hiring people was very slow and the bar was extremely, extremely high,\" he said.\n\nThat talent-dense structure allows Cursor to operate with minimal organizational process and move quickly, he added.\n\nThe preference for small, elite teams has become increasingly influential across the AI industry, including at Big Tech firms traditionally known for scale.\n\nMeta's superintelligence AI unit, for example, is led by a small group of top researchers. The AI unit comprises a tiny fraction of the company's headcount of over 70,000 employees.\n\n\"I've just gotten a little bit more convinced around the ability for small, talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research,\" Mark Zuckerberg said on Meta's earnings call in July.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said last year that \"we're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon.\"\n\nBusiness Insider in May compiled a list of the highest-valued AI startups around the world with teams of 50 employees or fewer, according to PitchBook data.",

    "fullText": "If there's one question celebrities over 50 never stop getting asked, it's how they stay healthy.\n\nEven interviews meant to promote a new movie, book, or company launch often veer into questions about health and diet.\n\nAfter a while, the answers start to sound familiar.\n\nFrom regular exercise to the morning routines they refuse to skip, the same six habits keep coming up.\n\nAt 100, Dick Van Dyke still hits the gym three days a week. He credits regular exercise with helping him live a long life, and while most people his age aren't exactly itching to work out, he said he can still \"move pretty well.\"\n\nHe is one of several celebrities who say age is no excuse for not being active.

Both Martha Stewart, 84, and Jane Fonda, 88, say they've been doing the same exercises for years.\n\n\"I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,\" Fonda said.\n\nMatt Damon, 55, said cutting gluten helped him slim down to 167 pounds for his latest film, a number he hadn't seen since high school.\n\nHe's not the only one who's made small but intentional changes to his diet. Alex Rodriguez, 50, has dramatically reduced how often he eats meat, and Al Roker, 71, said he's done the same.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they deprive themselves of the foods they enjoy.\n\n\"Moderation rather than deprivation is better in the long run,\" Roker said. \"If you deprive yourself of stuff that you like, eventually you're going to snap and go crazy.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston, 56, takes a similar approach, sticking to an 80/20 rule that leaves room for the foods she actually enjoys, such as a cheeseburger and fries.\n\nEven Demi Moore, 63, who sticks to a meat-free, nutrient-dense diet, can't give up her one guilty pleasure.\n\n\"I mean, I'm not perfect. I still do drink Red Bull. I do love it. But not many. One,\" Moore said.\n\nGetting older isn't something many of them seem preoccupied with. If anything, it's given them more confidence.\n\nFor Jodi Foster, turning 60 marked a turning point after she spent her 50s feeling like she couldn't compete with her younger self.\n\n\"Everything changed. I was like, 'Yeah, I don't care. I'm no longer tortured by any of this. I don't know why I seemed to care so much,'\" Foster said.\n\nSimilarly, Elizabeth Banks, 51, said she approaches aging with a positive mindset. She's happy to let age happen, rather than try to fight it. That goes for Linda Hamilton, 69, as well.\n\n\"I do not spend a moment trying to look younger on any level, ever. I have just completely surrendered to the fact that this is the face that I've earned,\" Hamilton said.\n\nFor both Nicole Kidman, 58, and Melinda French Gates, 61, aging has come with freedom from other people's opinions and a deeper respect for the experiences they've accumulated along the way.\n\n\"Like if I'm not your cup of tea, that's OK,\" French Gates said.\n\nAt this stage in life, many agree that time must be spent intentionally.\n\nKate Winslet said hitting 50 made her reevaluate her definition of success.\n\n\"Success, actually, for me more these days is more about pulling it off, being a decent person. You know, being able to take care of people, having time for friends, also learning how to be OK with not being busy all the time,\" Winslet said.\n\nShe's not the only celebrity who's said that milestone birthdays sparked similar periods of reflection.\n\nBoth Jane Fonda, 88, and Michelle Obama, 61, said that turning 60 was a pivotal moment that made them consider how they wanted to spend the rest of their lives.\n\n\"If I'm lucky, I live to 90 and that's 30 good summers,\" Obama said.\n\nFor Mary Steenburgen, 72, aging has also made her more selective about who she chooses to spend time with.\n\n\"With not wasting time on people that aren't in my life for the right reason, for being honest with myself about life,\" Steenburgen said.\n\nSlowing down also doesn't seem to be top of mind for many of them.\n\nKris Jenner, 70, has been clear she's not thinking about retirement just yet — and neither are Vera Wang, 76, nor June Squibb, 96.\n\n\"I think maybe a little bit like Warren Buffett or Queen Elizabeth II, I'm just going to keep prodding on because I feel as though I'm able to do my best work more and more,\" Wang said.\n\nSimilarly, working keeps Morgan Freeman active and helps ward off the effects of aging.\n\n\"There is a saying about old age — 'Keep moving' — and what Clint Eastwood, 95, says: 'Don't let the old man in,'\" Freeman, 88, said.\n\nWith Bill Nye, 70, staying busy extends well beyond work.\n\n\"I do crossword puzzles,\" Nye said. \"And as an engineer, I'm always designing and making little things.\"\n\nFor many, their mornings tend to be built around a few habits they don't skip.\n\nCindy Crawford, 59, said she eases into her mornings with a Bible podcast, dry brushing, and body oil — all before she even thinks about checking her phone.\n\n\"I probably heard it on a podcast, but it was like 'Think about it. What is the first input you want?'\" Crawford said.\n\nCate Blanchett, 56, said she loves a good icy plunge in the morning to \"jolt\" herself awake.\n\n\"I get up and get in. Five minutes, and it just brings everything back down. Because you have to connect with where you are,\" Blanchett said.\n\nMartha Stewart said she wakes up with the sun — literally, since she doesn't have curtains — and she never skips her morning green juice.\n\n\"If you have my green juice every day, you would just feel great all the time,\" Stewart said.",

    "description": "Ukrainian cities have set up hundreds of \"invincibility points\" in preparation for a rare mass blackout event like this week's.",
    "fullText": "A new wave of Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure has put two of its biggest regions to the test, as local cities rolled out plans for dealing with their worst blackouts in years.\n\nTheir prepared \"blackout mode\" response provides some insight into how urban centers might steel themselves for energy crises in wartime, especially during cold months. Ukraine's winter can turn brutal in January and February, when temperatures typically drop to 18°F.\n\nMass blackouts can also disrupt water and sewage systems, hospitals, public transportation, and road control, including traffic lights.\n\nBoth Ukrainian troops and civilians have long learned to cope with frequent energy shortages in the winter, maintaining backup generators, battery-powered lamps, and stockpiles of coal or gas.\n\nBut Moscow's latest attacks on Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk, two eastern Ukrainian regions, plunged both areas into almost total darkness this week.\n\nRegional leaders have described it as their biggest energy crisis since 2022, when Ukrainians first faced wartime power outages. Borys Filatov, the mayor of Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk's largest city, said the situation there was one of the most severe in the country and had risen to the level of a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"This is the first total blackout in the entire region in recent years,\" Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAs national authorities reported that over 1 million people had lost heat and water, local officials rushed to restore power and open access to facilities prearranged for the blackouts.\n\nOne of their prepared responses was to deploy \"invincibility points,\" or earmarked emergency shelters equipped with heat, communication, and basic necessities.\n\nSome local governments publish a map with available locations for civilians. The city of Dnipro, for example, maintains a list of mostly schools, municipality buildings, and metro stations designated as safe spots.\n\nCivilians are meant to visit these shelters to \"warm up, charge your gadgets, and wait out the power outage,\" per the municipal government.\n\nA video published by Oleksy Kuleba, Ukraine's vice prime minister for reconstruction and the minister for community and territorial development, showed one point in Dnipropetrovsk that appears to be located in a small convenience store.\n\nKuleba said the region's energy sector had been hit with a \"massive blow,\" and that over 5,000 people visited 500 such locations in the city of Dnipro within 24 hours after the power outages began.\n\nKuleba added that neighboring regions in Ukraine had donated 45 generators to Dnipropetrovsk, where some of its trains had switched to burning onboard fuel for power.\n\nZaporizhzhia's governor, Fedorov, also said on Thursday that the region had 400 established invincibility points, with 200 ready for visitors within two hours.\n\n\"Residents could warm up, call their relatives, drink hot tea, and, if necessary, stay overnight,\" he said.\n\nFilatov, Dnipro's mayor, said on Thursday that the city had set up 130 water dispensers, which his staff marked on Google Maps, and that disrupted public transport would be temporarily replaced by buses.\n\nHospitals were already equipped with alternative power sources and necessities, while parts of the city, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, were supported by backup power, he added.\n\n\"The city's sewage system is also powered,\" Filatov said.\n\nNotably, Filatov said that while authorities had extended local school holidays to January 11, kindergartens would operate on four-hour shifts \"because it's clear that parents are also in a difficult situation.\"\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Fedorov said the region had been left \"completely without electricity\" on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We immediately went into 'blackout' mode and started working according to a clear plan,\" he said.\n\nZaporizhzhia's hospitals similarly switched to backup power within minutes, and the region's traffic lights \"worked autonomously,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have since said that power has been partially returned to both regions, with Kuleba reporting on late Thursday evening that water and heating in Dnipropetrovsk had been restored to over 1.7 million people and 270,000 people, respectively.\n\nEnergy supplier DTEK said that around 700,000 families in the Dnipropetrovsk region once again had access to electricity, though it added that Russian bombing was continuing.\n\n\"An exhausting day for energy workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region,\" the company said.\n\nFedorov warned repeatedly on Thursday evening of incoming drone and guided missile strikes over Zaporizhzhia. He later said that Russia had carried out over 728 strikes, including drone attacks, artillery shelling, and multiple-launch rocket system strikes across Ukraine that day.\n\nBoth Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk are close to the southern and eastern front lines in Ukraine.\n\nKyiv has often accused Russia of specifically targeting energy infrastructure during the winter to exhaust and punish Ukrainian civilians, which is a war crime but is often difficult to prove.\n\nThe Kremlin has often responded that its strikes were intended for legitimate military targets, though the years have shown that critical facilities are regularly damaged or destroyed by the attacks.\n\n\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.",

    "description": "Love it or hate it, Lego's Smart Brick has elicited strong reactions from its adult fanbase as they process the analog toymaker's embrace of tech.",
    "fullText": "Small speakers hum as two \"Star Wars\"-themed Lego lightsabers clash. Lights beam from the top of a Lego-built airplane. A roaring engine sound kicks in as multiple vehicles race across the floor.\n\nIt's all part of a high-tech — and polarizing — update from Lego called Smart Play that the toymaker unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this week in Las Vegas.\n\nLego says its new line of chip-based bricks is \"one of the most significant evolutions\" since the launch of figurines in 1978.\n\nAt the center of the system is what Lego calls a Smart Brick. It's the same size as the classic two-by-four Lego piece — a design that has remained largely unchanged since the company began producing plastic bricks in the early 1930s — but it contains sensors, lights, and a tiny speaker.\n\nThe move pushes the famously analog toy deeper into the world of embedded technology. Among adult fans of Lego — known as AFOLs — the reaction has been mixed.\n\nOnline, some longtime builders and parents have voiced concern about what they see as the growing \"tech-ification\" of toys traditionally more reliant on one's imagination.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, Lego purists, toy enthusiasts, and industry watchers said they're intrigued by the technology — but some worry the added electronics will push Lego's prices even higher.\n\n\"I've loved the creativity involved without Smart Bricks,\" Jake Doll, 33, a Lego enthusiast who posts to AFOL communities on TikTok, told Business Insider. \"I think they'll put more investment in tech as it can increase the overall purchase price.\"\n\nThe bricks can sense what's happening around them, including light detection, player movement, and proximity to other figurines. When multiple Smart Bricks are used together, they communicate wirelessly with one another, allowing Lego sets to react in coordinated ways.\n\nLego says the system doesn't rely on AI or a constant internet connection. The bricks charge wirelessly, don't require disposable batteries, and play pre-programmed sounds directly from built-in speakers.\n\nThe company plans to debut the technology in three \"Star Wars\"-themed sets: a $70 Darth Vader set with 473 pieces, a $100 Luke's Red Five X-Wing set with 584 pieces, and a $160 Darth Vader's Throne Room Duel & A-Wing set with 962 pieces. They will hit store shelves on March 1.\n\n\"This isn't changing direction from what the Lego brand has always been,\" Tom Donaldson, the head of Legos's Creative Play Lab, told Business Insider in a statement. \"It's an expansion — we're staying true to our brand while innovating to meet how kids play today. The Lego brick our fans know and love isn't going anywhere; we're just making our play even more magical.\"\n\nBob Friedland, 50, a toy expert and former Toys R Us executive, told Business Insider he isn't planning to buy the Lego Smart Play sets when they launch.\n\nRight now, he owns 115 sets, according to his Lego app. That includes collections themed around \"Hocus Pocus,\" \"Stranger Things,\" and van Gogh's Starry Night. In a phone interview, Friedland said he's more interested in a $28, fully analog Lego DeLorean DMC replica from \"Back to the Future.\"\n\nHe said that Lego — which launched a 9,000-piece Star Wars-themed build for $999 in September — risks alienating already inflation-strained customers with increasingly expensive sets.\n\n\"These bricks will definitely bump up against the already-existing feeling that Lego is too expensive,\" he said.\n\nSmart Play isn't Lego's first attempt to blend bricks with technology.\n\nIn 1998, the company launched Lego Mindstorms, a line of programmable robotics kits that allowed builders to create machines that responded to sensors and computer code. More recently, Lego introduced the Lego Super Mario line in 2020, which featured interactive figures that triggered sound effects when placed on certain blocks.\n\nFriedland said that much of the online concern around toy \"tech-ification\" is attributable to other companies focusing on launching AI in teddy bears and dolls.\n\nMattel, for example, has partnered with OpenAI to put AI tech in some Barbie dolls. Child development researchers have warned that AI-enabled plushies aren't meeting basic safety standards. Online chatbots have appeared on children's iPads.\n\nBut other parents said they aren't sure their Lego-loving kids are even going to be interested in the company's new tech.\n\n\"As an adult fan, my joy stems from the building process and sharing that experience with my kids,\" Reid Exley, 43, a father of two and Lego enthusiast with more than 50 sets, said. \"My kids would likely enjoy the novelty of the sounds and interactivity. However, I suspect that novelty would quickly wear off and Lego play would remain largely unchanged.\"\n\nSome fans see Lego's launch of the Smart Play system less as a distraction — and more as an intriguing puzzle with potential.\n\n\"Are dolls that cry less creative than dolls that don't? Not really,\" Friedland said. \"I can already see myself trying to figure out Easter eggs that are unlocked by placing the Smart Brick in the right place or tapping it in the right sequence while it's next to the right colored brick.\"\n\nHe also told Business Insider that the current state of childhood play needs some new tech disruption. The Lego set, in his mind, could fit that bill.\n\n\"Parents who are wary of tech will likely look at this as a better alternative than a phone or iPad,\" he said. \"I think this is a much better solution than the AI toys out there.\"",

    "description": "What happens when you show up to work with a new nose, face, or body? That's a dilemma more workers are facing.",
    "fullText": "It's nice when a coworker compliments your new haircut. But what about your new face, nose, or body?\n\nWhen Jennifer Vaughan, 55, returned to work as a substitute teacher after her facelift, nobody said anything outright. Vaughan worried, \"God, is it not enough of a difference that somebody isn't asking?\"\n\nHowever, there were signs her coworkers were just being polite. One teacher did a double take and stammered their way through asking if something had changed. She told a few other teachers, and said, \"They were like, 'Okay, I thought something was up, but I wasn't totally sure.'\"\n\nNearly 1.6 million Americans opted for cosmetic surgery in 2024, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons; this follows a pandemic-era boom, during which procedures increased by 19% from 2019 to 2022.\n\nWith the return-to-office era in full swing, we're seeing our coworkers in person more often. Those with a new face, body, or waistline can't hide behind a camera-off virtual meeting. It's a tricky line to toe; yes, your appearance has changed — hopefully in a way you enjoy — but is it worth drawing attention to? How will coworkers respond, and should they?\n\nBigger picture, however, workers might keep finding it's worth it to go under the knife. Being hot at work is, empirically, a good way to get ahead; research has shown that good-looking workers see a real wage boost from an attractiveness premium.\n\nIn some cases, it could also be bonding. One worker I spoke with said that she learned about her Botox injector from a coworker; another said that she kept a nose job a strict secret, even after feeling pressure from managers to fess up.\n\nVaughan said that after the initial awkwardness, she has been an open book about her facelift. She also documented it on social media. Some of her coworkers have openly shared about getting liposuction or facial procedures, too.\n\nFor Kelsey Sowder, an Indianapolis-based 33-year-old in public relations, talking about her cosmetic procedures — from Botox to microneedling to the more intensive laser treatment she recently underwent — is part of her workplace experience. She works in a predominantly female office and openly discusses getting Botox with her coworkers.\n\n\"We're like, 'Look at my forehead. It looks amazing,'\" Sowder said. She and her coworkers will chat about what they might want to get done next. Sowder even found her first Botox injector from a coworker's recommendation.\n\n\"Luckily, I work at a place where there is no shame in discussing those things,\" she said. \"It's more of a camaraderie, and I feel very comfortable explaining what I do transparently and having that be well received, or people are respectful about it, and they're like, 'You know what? OK, maybe that's not for me, but that's for you.'\"\n\nFor some coworkers, it's a bonding experience. Procedures like Botox and filler, which don't usually require a full surgical experience, are immensely popular, with injectable procedures growing 4% year-over-year in 2024 to nearly 10 million patients, per ASPS; it's become, to some degree, destigmatized. The stereotype of an older celebrity with a Botox-frozen face has been supplanted by young influencers and professionals — and has even expanded to include more men. When speaking to coworkers about this story, several readily told me they'd had Botox and were under the impression that everyone was doing it.\n\nIt was a very different story when Mia McCormack, 33, got a rhinoplasty — colloquially known as a nose job — and chin implant over a decade ago. At the time, the Kentucky-based McCormack was working in retail and chose not to tell any of her coworkers that she was undergoing the procedure.\n\nShe said that her manager criticized her decision to keep the surgery to herself, believing that she should be open about why she took time off. When she came back two weeks later, a regular customer and a coworker immediately clocked the change, and her male coworkers assumed she had had her wisdom teeth removed because her cheeks were puffy.\n\nNow that time has passed, McCormack is happy to be open about the surgery. If she did it again today, she's not sure whether she'd share — she said she'd still err more on the side of privacy. But she does sense the changing tides.\n\n\"I think the stigma, it's definitely changed. I feel like so many people are getting stuff done more,\" McCormack said.\n\nAnother factor is the changing shape of work: A lot of offices are back in person and, in an otherwise dreary jobs market, healthcare services have been a rare bright spot. That means more Americans working in fields that are exposed to, and may even provide, some of these services.\n\nDr. Soheila Rostami, an oculofacial plastic surgeon in Virginia, said that while engineers, \"IT, and politicians don't talk about it,\" those in the medical field are very open with each other about getting work done; influencers and entertainers are also forthcoming.\n\nOne of those health professionals is Jennifer Belen, a 52-year-old medical spa consultant. She shared her facelift experience with her peers, coworkers, and close friends — and documented it on social media.\n\n\"I healed incredibly well. My bruising was mild,\" Belen said. \"I was back at work on day 11. I was in a field that I could explain to people like, 'Oh, I had a facelift.'\"\n\nIf she were in a different job, she said, she might have taken more time off or disclosed less. But her coworkers are eagle-eyed and understanding. She also felt she could be authentic with patients: She could explain what they could do without surgical intervention, and then use herself as an example of what surgery can achieve.\n\n\"I've had a couple friends that have gone for consults since I had my surgery, and I have so many people reach out on TikTok,\" Belen said.\n\nOf course, plastic surgery is still far from the norm and financially out of reach for many. Even the ever-popular Botox can run around $500 per session.\n\nThere's also a tricky line to toe between using plastic surgery as a means to express agency versus using it to conform to societal standards, which could also open the door for professional advancement.\n\n\"It is a challenge because people who do completely elective procedures often are doing so because they are in groups that are most likely to be discriminated against or left behind in the workplace,\" author and sociologist Kjerst Gruys said, referring to women, people of color, older folks, and those who are not thin.\n\nGruys said that she wants people to feel like they're making a willful choice to undergo expensive or risky beauty enhancements rather than \"because they're concerned that they won't have the opportunities that they deserve if they don't look a certain way.\"\n\nMcCormack, who underwent a rhinoplasty and chin implant while working in retail, said she noticed her sales increased after the tweaks, especially from male customers.\n\nFor Belen, the medical spa consultant, undergoing plastic surgery helped her align her self-perception with what she saw in the mirror. She has received questions on social media from the surgery-curious — some of whom see it as something that can give them a competitive edge at work.\n\n\"I've had a couple people say they just feel like they're in a young world and they're older and they don't want to be seen as aging out of their career,\" Belen said.\n\nFor Michael Conigliaro, 55, the change has felt positive. At first, he was nervous — he had grown his hair out to distract from his neck lift, deep plane facelift, cheek implants, upper and lower blepharoplasty, buccal fat removal, Erbium laser, and fat transfer.\n\nStill, he documented his journey online. Southern California-based Conigliaro has worked in and around beauty and aesthetics for most of his career; he's currently a patient coordinator for a well-known orthodontist.\n\nHowever, he still felt some nerves about returning to work. It was more psychological: Did he look substantially different? Had he made the right call?\n\nBut ultimately, he feels that the surgery has opened doors for him at work. He's strengthened bonds with patients who have also undergone surgery, and has felt a tangible confidence boost.\n\n\"When you take this step, it's not selfish,\" Conigliaro said. \"Do it because you show up better, you show up more confident, you're in work — depending on the type of field that you're in — more confident in what you're doing because you feel good.\"",

    "fullText": "I am the oldest daughter of three siblings. I'm three years older than my brother and 12 years older than my sister. We have a great, tight-knit family, and my parents have always showered us with love.\n\nHowever, my issue is that my parents have changed their parenting style, and my younger sister is having a very different experience from the one I had, even though my dad still works the same job as he did 12 years ago, and my mom still stays home.\n\nI had to work and take out loans to attend college and cover my lifestyle needs after graduating from high school. However, I found out over the holidays that my sister, who graduates this spring, will attend college entirely on my parents' dime. She has never had to work a job because they worry it will distract her from her grades.\n\nI barely concealed my anger when I found out, but the more I think about it, the angrier I get. I don't want to start anything with my parents, and I do like where I am in life, but my late teens and early 20s were really difficult for me, and I am still repaying student loans. I know if I don't confront them about this now, I'm likely to blow up on them about it eventually. How do I talk to them about this?\n\nOn a crisp April day in 2004, my mom picked me up from my homeschool co-op with a surprise in the back seat: a tiny baby girl, 15 years my junior. In the early days, I helped my mom care for my little sister, but within a few years, I transitioned to being more like a frequent houseguest after leaving for college. I wanted to bond with my sister during my visits home, but I often found myself distracted by my parents' brand-new parenting style, in which screen limits ceased to exist and the \"Oh come on, you aren't sick!\" of my childhood was replaced with \"I don't think she feels good\" every time my sister misbehaved.\n\nComedian Nate Bergatze has a great bit on this phenomenon, describing his much younger sister apparently being \"raised by her best friends\" rather than by the tightly structured, rule-heavy parents who defined his own upbringing.\n\nAs I was writing this column, I texted my mother to ask her about the disparity. She explained, \"As a young parent, you think your kids aren't bothered or harmed by various external hardships. But as you get older, you see the impact, and so you become more protective of your younger child's emotional health, and that might look like too much grace.\"\n\nMy mom's explanation seems to tally with your experience. Your struggles in your late teens and early 20s are likely the very reason your parents have tried to ease your sister's entrée to adulthood. This may translate into something that looks like favoritism, but it actually reflects the time and energy they've spent reviewing your upbringing and what they wish they'd done differently for you.\n\nThere's also a good chance your parents' financial situation has improved in the last 12 years, saving steadily despite having the same jobs they've always had. Parenting philosophies tend to align with a family's financial means. For instance, if I have money to spend on the new Nike sneakers that all the cool kids at school are wearing, I'll build a whole case in my mind around my kid's self-esteem to justify buying them. However, if I don't have the money to do so, I suddenly have no interest in raising materialistic conformists. Perhaps your parents valued self-sufficiency when you were coming of age, due to their financial constraints at the time, but now value stability and provision, given they can afford it.\n\nUnderstanding an explanation, however, doesn't mean the changes your parents have made for your sister don't hurt you, or that you need to spare your parents' feelings about their impact on you. As you alluded to, talking about these things is the best way to keep ourselves from falling out over them.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean you need to have a huge, emotional conversation about it, however. Instead, the dialogue should take the form that best suits your goals. If you want your parents' financial support to pay off your remaining college debt, I suggest approaching the conversation seriously. Schedule the discussion in advance, and during the meeting, focus on your financial need and only mention your sister's situation as the reason you felt you could ask. Don't accuse your parents of favoritism or dwell on your hurt feelings.\n\nYou could say something like, \"You mentioned paying for my sister's tuition the other day, and I'm so glad you're able to do that. I remember how stressful it was for me to work and take out loans during college. I understand that our family's financial situation was different back then, and I don't blame you for it. However, now that you're in a more stable position, I was wondering if you could help cover some of my education costs as well, since I still have a lot of college debt.\" This way, the comparison speaks for itself without putting your parents on the defensive.\n\nHowever, if you've accepted the way things are, but would like to address the hurt you feel, I wouldn't schedule a whole conversation for it. I would simply start talking about it as it comes up — even joking about it, Nate Bargatze-style. For instance, when I texted my mom to get a quote about parenting her youngest very differently than her older children, I didn't offer a qualifier or soften my reasoning for why she might be an expert on the topic. She knows I feel this way because when my sister dyed her hair blue at 15, I reminded everyone that when I came home from college at 19 with a cartilage piercing, Mom made me take it out.\n\nYour family will likely recognize the real sense of injustice behind your jokes and comments. Sure, it may annoy them, and it will absolutely annoy your sister, but there's nothing wrong with gently telling your truth. Your parents have changed their parenting style without apology; this is your honest response.\n\nI only gave my mom 10 minutes to respond with a quote because I was on a deadline, after all. She didn't argue the past; she explained it. Because we all know how it was. We make allowances for one another's humanity — my entitled demands for quotes, her evolving her parenting style, which I couldn't reap the benefits of. To me, that's the real proof of loving families like mine and yours; we can handle the truth because we know what we share is bigger than all of it. We keep these loving relationships strong by not holding resentment or anger inside, but instead addressing those feelings as honestly and constructively as we can.\n\nLooking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships?

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it's \"naive\" to think the US will shift away from China.\n\n\"The idea of decoupling for whatever reason, philosophical reasons or national security reasons, it's not based on any common sense,\" Huang said during an episode of the \"No Priors\" podcast posted on Thursday.\n\nHuang, whose company is eagerly awaiting the ability to sell advanced chips in China again, praised President Donald Trump's approach to navigating the relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\n\"I am optimistic that our relationship with China will improve, that President Trump and the administration has a really, really grounded and common-sense attitude and philosophy around how to think about China, that they're an adversary, but they're also a partner in many ways, and that the idea of decoupling is naive.\"\n\nNvidia may soon be returning to the lucrative Chinese market, which Huang once estimated could be worth $50 billion a year.\n\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that China planned to approve some sales of Nvidia's H200 chips \"as soon as this quarter.\" In December, Trump lifted a Biden-era policy that effectively banned Nvidia from selling its older H200 in China, provided the US government gets a 25% cut on future sales. Huang has repeatedly said that the US will not slow down China's AI advancements by curtailing the sales of advanced chips.\n\nHuang said on Tuesday that he was not expecting a formal announcement from Beijing approving the sales of H200 chips. China previously imposed its restrictions on such sales.\n\n\"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said during a news conference on the sidelines of CES in Las Vegas. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"\n\nAs for the broader US-China relationship, Huang said that both nations ought to continue to invest in their own independence. Trump has deployed a combination of tariffs and incentives to encourage US-based companies to bring their manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\"When you depend too much on someone, the relationship becomes too emotional, as you know,\" Huang said. \"And so it's good to have some independence or there as much independence as either would like, but to recognize that there's a lot of coupling, a lot of dependence between the two countries. And I think there needs to be a nuanced strategy, a nuanced attitude about how to manage this relationship in a productive way for all of the people of two countries and for all of the people around the world.\"\n\nThe world needs both sides to figure it out, Huang said.\n\n\"Everybody depends on a productive, constructive relationship of the two most important nations and the single most important relationship for the next century,\" he said. \"And so we have to find that answer.\"",

    "description": "Nancy Green joined Levi Strauss & Co. to lead the Beyond Yoga brand in 2022. She works out often and is a member at Erewhon for the salads.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nancy Green, the CEO of Beyond Yoga, who's based in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent my entire career in retail, starting in college, where I worked on the shop floor. I spent nearly three decades with Gap Inc., across two stints, raising four kids while building global brands. One of the highlights was scaling Athleta from a $250 million business to a billion-dollar powerhouse.\n\nIn 2022, I joined Levi Strauss & Co. to lead the Beyond Yoga brand. This brand feels like a perfect fit for me — it sits right at the intersection of wellness, joy, and community.\n\nI do a lot of workouts. I love yoga classes, Pilates, lifting weights, and hiking — all in Beyond Yoga wear, of course.\n\nHere's what a typical day looks like for me.\n\nI wake up around 6 am, whether I'm at home in the Bay Area or Los Angeles, to go into the office. The first thing I need is coffee. My husband makes a beautiful latte when he's around, but I'm perfectly happy to make one myself.\n\nI quickly scan emails and the news to see if there's anything urgent. Then I carve out time for movement. I'm not wedded to one routine — I enjoy mixing it up.\n\nIn the Bay Area, I'll lace up my sneakers and hike right out my back door into the hills, surrounded by nature. In LA, I'll either go for a power walk outside or head to the gym in my apartment building. I alternate between strength training and cardio during the week, and I reserve Pilates or yoga for the weekends.\n\nI aim for 35-45 minutes of exercise per day. That time isn't just about fitness — it's when I set my intentions. The way you walk into the office matters. My role is to read the moment and set the right tone.\n\nI shower, get dressed, and usually have a high-protein breakfast of Greek yogurt with organic berries.\n\nTuesdays are early flight days. I'm up at 4:45 am to head to the airport and fly to LA, where I stay for three to four days. I keep an apartment there so I can drop my bags and get straight to work.\n\nWhat drains me is unnecessary negative energy. I don't expect everyone to be positive all the time, but constant negativity that isn't productive can be exhausting. That's why I protect my energy and focus on bringing an upbeat, optimistic tone into the office.\n\nMost days, I arrive at the Beyond Yoga office by 9 a.m. That first stretch of the morning is usually about setting the agenda.\n\nTuesdays start with a business update meeting: What did we learn last week? What's trending? What needs adjusting? It gives everyone clarity and momentum.\n\nWe design and manufacture all our own products, so the quality of our fabrics is of the utmost importance. They need to be beautiful, durable, and versatile — pants that look just as good on the trails of Marin County as they do on the streets of New York.\n\nI'm a creature of habit with food. Breakfast is always protein-forward, and lunch is nearly always a salad.\n\nIn LA, there's nothing right near the office, so I either order delivery or I stop by Erewhon. True confession — I'm an Erewhon member. I don't buy everything there, but I really love their salads.\n\nMy assistant does her best to keep 45 minutes protected, although sometimes business intrudes and someone needs to run something by me while I'm eating.\n\nAfternoons can be intense. We run on a quarterly \"concept to customer\" cycle, and the milestone meetings that anchor it can last multiple days. We'll review samples for next year's line, align on design direction, and make critical investment decisions.\n\nOn other afternoons, I'll be in creative reviews, reviewing brand campaigns, or engaging in strategy conversations about real estate and store growth. There's always a decision that needs to be made quickly, or a trend that requires a response.\n\nThings come at me constantly. Sometimes it's a genuine crisis, and other times it's something personal, such as when a child is ill. You must lead through all of it and shift your focus when necessary.\n\nThere will always be curveballs, but as a leader, you can't let them derail you. Staying calm and steady matters. I need to be able to react, pivot, and refocus, but I can't be effective if every unexpected moment throws me off.\n\nI often pop into a store on my way home because we're trying something that I want to see for myself. Fridays are sacred, and I spend them in our stores.\n\nI grew up in retail on the shop floor, and I love being where the energy is — seeing how product shows up, hearing directly from customers, and connecting with store teams. It's the best way to keep the feedback loop alive.\n\nI try to finish by 6-7 p.m. at the latest. That habit stems from raising my kids, when family dinners were a non-negotiable part of our routine. Even though they're grown, I still anchor myself to that rhythm.\n\nEvenings are about balance — sometimes it's a business dinner, other nights I'll cook with my husband. I might pour a glass of wine, catch up on the news I missed during the day, or relax with a good series on Netflix or Apple TV. I just finished \"Ripple.\"\n\nI'm not rigid, but I prioritize sleep: if I'm up at 6 a.m., I need to be asleep by 10 p.m. so I can get a full eight hours.\n\nLeading a brand through growth takes stamina, so I prioritize wellness and surround myself with great people. You have to do what you love and love what you do — I feel lucky that after decades in this industry, I still do.",

    "fullText": "Point72's chief strategy officer is no longer at the $41.5 billion hedge fund.\n\nJames Malick, who joined Steve Cohen's firm in 2023, departed the asset manager this week, two people familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Malick did not respond to requests for comment, while Point72 declined to comment.\n\nMalick joined from Izzy Englander's Millennium, which also recently lost an executive focused on strategy, Alexander Campbell, Business Insider previously reported. Like Campbell, Malick came to the hedge-fund world after a stint at Boston Consulting Group.\n\nA person close to the firm said Malick was a member of the firm's senior leadership team, responsible for reviewing new business opportunities and leading strategic initiatives.\n\nMalick states on his LinkedIn profile that he was also an advisor for the MLB's New York Mets, the baseball team owned by Cohen. He will no longer be consulting for the team, the person said.\n\nPoint72 has expanded into new areas in recent years. The firm launched a private credit business as well as a fund dedicated to investing in the artificial intelligence trend, known as Turion. This year, the manager launched an additional equities vertical, Valist, to improve access to corporate C-suites. And, as Business Insider previously reported, Cohen told his firm's backers that commodities may be the next area of expansion for the firm.\n\nCorporate strategy roles are still not common in the $5 trillion hedge fund industry, but as firms, especially the expansive multistrategy managers that have come to dominate the space, have become increasingly institutional and have tapped talent from consultancies and banks to fill their management ranks and non-investing roles.\n\nFor example, Point72, which states on its website that it has more than 3,000 employees globally, recruited its chief operating officer, Gavin O'Connor, from Goldman Sachs, where he worked for over two decades.",

    "fullText": "Trump's pledge to upend Wall Street's 15-year push into the market for single-family American homes raised alarms across the real estate investment industry — and skepticism.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about it,\" said Todd Henderson, the head of real estate for the Americas at DWS, an investment firm that has purchased single-family rental homes.\n\nWhile details of Trump's proposal are unknown, Henderson expects that it will eventually exclude institutional buyers who have purchased newly built homes, which have become the focus of much of the single-family rental (SFR) industry.\n\n\"The fear is that large investors are buying single-family homes and that it's taking out of the sales pool and driving up the cost of housing — that's what is driving this discussion,\" Henderson said. \"We're building this stuff and adding it to supply.\"\n\nIn a message on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that he was \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSome analysts, however, suggested that that view was out of step with the institutional SFR industry's contemporary business model, which has shifted away from the inefficient — and politically sensitive practice — of competing against everyday homebuyers to scoop up properties one by one.\n\nInvitation Homes, a public company that is one of the largest owners of SFR homes, \"has almost exclusively moved to acquiring homes from homebuilders rather than on the MLS,\" according to a research note from RBC.\n\n\"AMH's external growth comes from development rather than acquisitions,\" Barclays wrote in a report, referring to American Homes 4 Rent, another large SFR owner.\n\nTrump's announcement caused shares of Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent to fall by about 7% and 9% respectively, according to KBW.\n\nOther major investors, including Blackstone, also saw an impact on share prices. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, a non-trade REIT managed by the firm, holds about $11 billion worth of SFR investments totaling about 9% of its portfolio.\n\nJade Rahmani, an analyst at KBW, wrote that the market reaction \"seems excessive and could present a buying opportunity\" in a Wednesday report on the potential ban.\n\nDetails were scant about how Trump's prohibition on Wall Street homebuying would work.\n\nTrump said that he would be \"calling on Congress to codify it\" and that he would \"discuss this topic\" during \"my speech in Davos in two weeks.\"\n\nTrump has walked back policies, such as his tariffs, due to disruptions to the economy and investor concerns.\n\nThe likely need for congressional approval could insert more complexity — and uncertainty — over the process of formalizing an SFR ban.\n\nA Mizuho report said that Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno had proposed a bill to codify Trump's SFR ban, but that it \"doesn't believe\" it will progress \"anytime soon.\"\n\nHenderson said he believes that any rules imposed on the SFR industry would exempt both builders and buyers of new SFR homes and would allow major investors to sell existing portfolios freely. Such caveats would leave the SFR industry basically unchanged.\n\n\"I think it will increase the value of the purpose-built SFR homes and make that strategy even more valuable,\" Henderson said.\n\nThe SFR industry has pointed out that its investors own a comparatively small share of the roughly 80 million single-family homes in the country.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors who own 10 residential units or more held about 3.4% of all single-family homes, and that larger investors with at least 1,000 units controlled just 0.73% of the inventory.\n\n\"Professional single-family housing providers represent a small segment of the overall housing market, and the single-family rental industry remains focused on supporting renters while also supporting pathways to homeownership,\" said a spokeswoman for National Rental Home Council, an industry group that represents SFR owners.",

    "fullText": "Saving for retirement has been a cornerstone of personal finance for well over a century. It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Musk's blue-sky vision of an abundant future may seem like wishful thinking — or even dangerous advice if it leads people to stop saving, but the world doesn't change as he expects, leaving them short in retirement.",

    "description": "All it took was a pledge for $1.5 trillion in military spending to spark a reversal in the sector.",
    "fullText": "The \"TACO trade,\" short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was one of the great market memes of 2025. Whenever the market would throw a tantrum about a Trump policy — usually related to tariffs — the president would reverse course to stem the bleeding.\n\nA similar story has played out this week within US defense stocks, with a few unique twists. Here's the minute-by-minute recap from Wednesday afternoon:\n\nIt was that last statement, 2 hours and 9 minutes after Trump's first post about defense companies, that sparked a rally in those exact same defense stocks on Thursday. The optimism of a huge spending increase had offset the initial sting of industry criticism.\n\nIt wasn't a precise TACO trade situation. It was closer to something I'd like to coin as the TUNA trade: Trump Usually Negates Announcements. The president didn't outright reverse a prior statement. He countered a bearish opinion with something bullish that counterbalanced it. There's a big difference!\n\nThe volatile episode leaves questions unanswered about the future of the industry. The knee-jerk reaction from investors was to buy/sell first, then ask questions later. What does the longer term look like?\n\nWall Street analysts generally support the idea that the additional military spending will offset any new capital restrictions.\n\n\"The changes are significant but not necessarily draconian,\" said JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman. A \"potential budget increase would support sustained growth, taking some sting out of the executive order.\"\n\nKen Herbert, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says large-cap defense companies will feel the squeeze more than their defense-tech counterparts, which he sees outperforming.\n\n\"Defense primes will look to de-risk major program investments by securing long-term purchase agreements, where possible,\" he added.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu called Trump's comments an \"overreach\" and said that they catalyzed something that was already bound to happen.\n\n\"The industry has been clear that it is ready to invest on clearer demand signals,\" she said.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, $1.5 trillion in 2027 sounds quite appealing. If all goes according to plan — and that's a big \"if\" — more stock gains could be in store for defense companies.",

    "description": "One small artifact opened up a world of discovery of a Neolithic civilization with a remarkably advanced social structure.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA stone seal found at the archaeological site of Tadım Fortress in Türkiye reveals how Neolithic people lived 7,500 years ago.\n\nThe seal is thought to possibly have identifying information to mark someone’s property, but alternatively, it could have also been used in agricultural trade.\n\nWhatever it was used for, this artifact is evidence of a civilization whose social structure was much more advanced than previously expected.\n\nWhile monolithic structures that have survived thousands of years may generate the most headlines, it is sometimes the smallest artifacts that can be portals into a civilization that was making social advances long before the Sphinx or the Parthenon towered over the ancient world.\n\nTadım Fortress has been revealing such relics of a surprisingly advanced Neolithic civilization in the Elazim region of eastern Türkiye. A 7,500-year-old stone seal recently unearthed at the site predates the kingdom of Urartu, which is already known for having had complex and organized social structures, but the seal reflects that they had already begun to take shape millennia before the rise of Urartu. Excavations that led to the discovery of the seal and other objects were overseen by the Elazig Museum and the Provincial Directorate of Culture and Tourism, with support from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Elazig Governorship.\n\n“The findings show that the region was not only inhabited since the earliest times, but also developed sophisticated social, economic, and cultural practices that influenced later civilizations,” governor Numan Hatipoğlu told Türkiye Today.\n\nWhat exactly the seal was used for remains unknown, but archaeologists think it might have been a marker of property or ownership. It may have also signified personal identity. This is a rare example of relatively advanced social organization in such an early culture. Investigations as to what it reveals about Neolithic administration, daily life and social activity are ongoing. Archaeological studies in Elazig are part of the preservation efforts of the Turkish Ministry’s Heritage for the Future Project. It is the only stone seal found so far, but another seal locally known as ‘cec damga muhru’ was found to have been used in the trading of grain, reinforcing evidence of a structured society and economy.\n\nThis is not the first groundbreaking find at Tadım Fortress. While it is one of the oldest, buried beneath vessels and other objects left behind by the Byzantine, Roman, Seljuk and Ottoman empires, other artifacts and structures revealed how people lived slightly after the period when the seal was made. A temple that was also recently discovered at the site is now some of the oldest evidence of ritual architecture in the region. Dating to the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, around 6,000 years ago, it features a stone altar with a ritual blood channel. Cut marks on the altar, along with animal and human remains, suggest blood sacrifice to appease deities. The temple shows that many aspects of life back then were closely tied to religion and ritual.\n\nNear the temple are the remnants of both ceremonial and everyday items, including tools and seal stamps that were likely used for agricultural trade, much like the one found along with the stone seal. There were also idol figurines on four podiums supposedly used for devotional offerings. Possibly the most striking is a hearth meant to keep a holy flame burning. Unique double-headed hearths carved with images of animals had previously been found at Tadım, with a jug beside them that is thought to have once held sacrificial blood or wine. Fire was sacred to many ancient cultures, such as the ancient Greeks and Romans, who associated it with Hestia (also Vesta), goddess of home and hearth.\n\nFindings including the stone seal are now undergoing analysis and preservation at the Elazig Archaeology and Ethnography Museum. Excavations in Tadım are ongoing, and the deeper archaeologists dig, the further back in time they will travel, with objects that have not seen the light of the sun in thousands and thousands of years potentially surfacing as a result.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "The higher spending on AI chips is going to be a tailwind for TSMC stock in 2026.\n\nIts earnings are likely to grow at a faster pace than Wall Street's expectations this year.\n\nTSMC's attractive valuation and strong earnings potential suggest that it could soar nicely.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nThe S&P 500 has been in a bull market for more than three years now, entering this territory in October 2022, and the good news is that the index is expected to sustain its rally in 2026 as well.\n\nAfter recording three consecutive years of double-digit gains, a feat that the index has achieved five times since it came into existence in 1957, Wall Street is looking forward to another year of robust growth in the S&P 500. Deutsche Bank, for instance, expects the S&P 500 to hit 8,000 points by the end of 2026, suggesting potential gains of 15% from current levels.\n\nAdditionally, financial services firm Carson Group's chief market strategist Ryan Detrick points out that once a bull market is three years old, it tends to stretch up to eight years on average, citing data going back to 1950. All this indicates that 2026 could turn out to be another good year for the stock market, and artificial intelligence (AI) is set to play a key role in driving more gains this year.\n\nJPMorgan points out that strong capital spending and earnings growth fueled by AI are going to be a catalyst for stocks in 2026. That's why now is a good time to take a closer look at a key company that's playing a central role in driving AI adoption -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) -- before the stock market heads higher in the new year.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, manufacturing chips for all the leading chip designers and consumer electronics companies. That explains why it has been growing at a healthy pace in the past couple of years. TSMC's share of the foundry market stood at an incredible 72% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Counterpoint Research. Its fabrication plants that produce advanced chips for customers, such as Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Apple, Sony, Advanced Micro Devices, and others, are reportedly running at full capacity.\n\nThis isn't surprising as the cutting-edge nature of TSMC's advanced manufacturing nodes means that chip designers are able to pack in more transistors into a smaller area on chips fabricated by the Taiwan-based giant. As a result, TSMC-made chips are both powerful and power-efficient, making them ideal for various applications, including data centers, smartphones, and personal computers (PCs).Deloitte estimates that $250 billion to $300 billion could be spent on AI data center chips alone this year, up from an estimated $150 billion last year.",

    "fullText": "Two years. That's the ambitious timeline Boston Dynamics set for its Atlas humanoid robots to start working on Hyundai's factory floor.\n\nThe company's CEO, Robert Playter, told Business Insider at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that Atlas will need to hit several milestones within that timeframe to get there, including an ability to learn fast.\n\n\"We need to be able to bring a new task to bear in a day or two,\" Playter said. \"And that's because, I think in a factory, there's literally hundreds of tasks and the tasks evolve.\"\n\nAtlas is a six-foot, 200-pound, bipedal robot with a face inspired by Disney's Pixar lamp.\n\nHyundai, which has a controlling majority stake in Boston Dynamics, revealed on Monday its plans to deploy Atlas at its sprawling factory in Ellabell, Georgia, by 2028.\n\nThe big pitch behind Atlas is that the robot will be able to learn industrial tasks quickly and adapt to the existing floor plan of a factory by leveraging artificial intelligence.\n\n\"If you're going to have a robot that's actually useful in the factory, it's got to do a hundred different tasks, not just one or two,\" he said.\n\nBoston Dynamics announced on Monday a partnership with Google DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research lab.\n\nPlayter is hinging on AI's advancement within the next two years to unlock Atlas' ability to learn quickly, reason, and, in the near future, interact with its human coworkers.\n\n\"It's really AI that's going to enable that,\" he said. \"We also have to make that unprecedented reliability, 99.9% reliable. The AI is not quite there yet, but it's very promising.\"\n\nThe CEO said Atlas will start with simpler tasks at Hyundai's automotive plant, such as parts sequencing or organizing car parts in the right order before they're sent to the assembly line.\n\n\"That's really a logistics task,\" he said. \"And then we're going to evolve as the product and as the capabilities get more sophisticated. We're going to eventually start entering assembly tasks.\"",

Higher earners can prop up spending in the short run, shielding cracks by lower earners who might not have the same spending or earning power, but eventually those cracks may win out, pushing the economy into a downturn.\n\n\"Most of the consumption does happen by people who have more means,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a December press conference. \"I think the top third accounts for way more than a third of the consumption, for example. So, it's a good question how sustainable that is.\"\n\nJed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said on X that the reasons behind the low hiring aren't necessarily due to artificial intelligence or the Trump administration's policies.\n\n\"Hiring has been very low since 2024, and has flattened out,\" Kolko said. \"If it were AI, the hiring slowdown would have accelerated in 2025, rather than plunging earlier.

That's the lowest rate ever recorded since the New York Fed began tracking the measure.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the chief economist of New Century Advisors, thinks the low-hire, low-fire state isn't sustainable. She told Business Insider in December that she thinks the job market will go in one of two ways.\n\nOne way: \"We really slow down in terms of hiring, and we hit a place where the bottom falls out.

Economists have also said businesses did a lot of hiring in the pandemic recovery period, so they might not have needed to add a lot more employees since then.\n\n\"At some point, if you want to grow as a company, you're going to have to bring in more workers,\" Sahm said.\n\nThe November report showed that unemployment reached 4.6%, the highest rate since September 2021. Unemployment has been at or above 4% since May 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the US added 64,000 jobs, largely due to the healthcare sector, which added 46,300 jobs.

Afterward, the xAI CEO said he followed his own advice by uploading the results of a medical test to his company's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,\" Musk said during a wide-ranging interview with Diamandis on \"Moonshots\" posted on Tuesday. \"None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.\"\n\nIt's unclear why Musk underwent an MRI. His discussion with Diamandis, the founder of the XPrize and a Harvard-educated doctor, underscores the ongoing discussion about longevity that surrounds much of the discussion of AI's future development.\n\nAcross Silicon Valley, tech billionaires like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Peter Thiel are funding millions in research to combat aging and extend humanity's lifespan. In 2024, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote that AI could double life expectancy by 2030.\n\nLast week, Musk encouraged people to try uploading their results to Grok. He said that a Norwegian man posted on Reddit that Grok saved his life after the chatbot encouraged him to return to the hospital to get a CT scan, which confirmed that doctors had missed that his appendix was close to rupturing.\n\n\"Try it!\" Musk wrote on X, quote-tweeting remarks from a February 2025 appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nAt the time, Musk told Rogan that AI would be \"very good\" at helping with medical diagnoses.\n\nMusk said true immortality or close to it would be \"one of the worst curses you could possibly give anyone.\" That being said, the billionaire thinks it should be possible to crack the secret to staving off aging.\n\n\"I've long thought that longevity or semi-mortality is an extremely solvable problem,\" Musk said. \"I don't think it's a particularly hard problem. I mean, when you consider the fact that your body is extremely synchronized in its age, the clock must be incredibly obvious.\"\n\nDiamandis pitched Musk on working with Fountain Life, a longevity company that Diamandis cofounded with Tony Robbins and William Kapp. Depending on the membership tier, Fountain Life offers access to \"AI-guided diagnostics\" that test for biomarkers. The first goal of this branch of medicine, Kapp told TechCrunch last year, is \"don't die of anything stupid.\"\n\n\"We do a 200 gigabyte upload of you, everything knowable about you, full genome, all imaging, everything,\" Diamandis said, adding he did not want Musk \"to pull a Steve Jobs.\"\n\nApple's visionary leader died in 2011 of pancreatic cancer.

    "title": "4 Googlers share how they reinvented their careers and pivoted to AI",
    "description": "Each of these four Google employees took different paths to pivot into AI, but all of them spent roughly a year preparing for the transition.",
    "fullText": "Pivoting to an AI job may be trendy, but that doesn't mean it's an easy feat.\n\nAs AI-related jobs continue to pop up, and companies invest heavily in upskilling, more workers are looking to add \"AI\" to their job titles.\n\nTo see how it can be done, Business Insider spoke with four Google employees who transitioned to AI teams. While each followed a different path, all of them spent roughly a year building the necessary skills to land new roles — and for some, the transition took several years.\n\nFrom participating in employee hackathons to becoming AI content creators, the four employees share how they made the shift:\n\nEmrick Donadei said he didn't feel qualified to pivot to an AI team until he participated in Google's seven-day employee hackathon in 2024. The 32-year-old engineer said he didn't create a revolutionary product, but it gave him hands-on experience with tools, and something tangible he could use to start conversations with teams across the company. \n\nRoughly 10 months after his first hackathon, he said he landed his new role.\n\nWhile the hackathon kick-started his transition, his work didn't stop there. The Googler continued to experiment with tools outside the hackathon, he said. He also created a podcast about AI developments and watched Andrej Karpathy's YouTube videos to get up to speed with machine learning concepts and anything related to LLMs.\n\nAfter finding a new role, Donadei said that he participated in another hackathon in 2025, which opened up even more opportunities. He had the opportunity to transition into AI research, began working part-time on open-source committees and with AI research teams, and published a public technical disclosure with Google as a follow-up to his work.\n\nMaitri Mangal, 27, worked as a traditional software engineer before transitioning to an AI team. During the roughly year-long period she took to prepare for the pivot, Mangal dedicated roughly two hours daily toward up-skilling, and still spends hours learning weekly, she said.\n\nShe said that creating social media content was a way for her to reinforce the material that she learned through Google's internal training and other online courses.\n\n\"That really, for me, changed everything,\" Mangal said about content creation.\n\nShe said seeing that her content helped other people motivated her to continue learning about the technology and making videos. Even though she already changed jobs, she said she still spends about an hour daily learning new information, whether that's in the form of internal trainings for her job, or watching YouTube courses to prepare for content.\n\nRahul Kasanagottu, 32, spent two and a half years transitioning to an AI role at the tech giant. He said his paternity leave gave him a head start on reading about AI.\n\nIn addition to reading 11 books on the topic, Kasanagottu also took a Deep Learning Specialization course taught by Andrew Ng, and watched 3Blue1Brown videos on YouTube.\n\nSimilar to Donadei, Kasanagottu said solo projects were a key part of his career transition. He said it was difficult to convince hiring managers he could do the job without having demos and hands-on projects to show. While the books he read typically didn't come with assignments, the courses had a lot of hands-on exercises, Kasanagottu said.\n\nMilica Cvetkovic took a different path than the other three Googlers who made internal pivots to AI teams. She landed a role in AI consulting at the tech giant about three years ago, after completing graduate school and conducting research in machine learning.\n\nAfter she received her Master's in statistics, she worked as a machine-learning engineer at a Madison-based startup and simultaneously taught machine-learning boot camps and college-level courses.\n\n\"Having a skill to talk in a nontechnical way is probably the most valuable skill that I bring,\" Cvetkovic said.\n\nHer move to an AI team at Google was less of a deliberate pivot and more the result of the right opportunity aligning with her background and interests. She said that she realized she didn't want to code anymore, and that's when she came across a consulting role at Google.\n\nCvetkovic said she can't name one single experience that led to her getting the job. Rather, she compared her career journey to training for a marathon. A marathon, she said, is the \"celebration of all the work that you've done.\"\n\n\"That's literally what my application was. It was just very good fit,\" Cvetkovic said.\n\nDid you transition to an AI role? We want to hear from you.

    "description": "I asked ChatGPT to break it down for me, given the state of crypto. It made clear that its answer is \"a structured way to think about the opportunity and risk.\"",
    "fullText": "Cryptocurrency is either touted as the next big thing to make you rich or the riskiest investment ever. Yet despite its volatility and constant controversy, many investors continue to find ways to profit in the crypto space.\n\nIf someone realistically wanted to get rich via cryptocurrency in 2026, which one is most likely to make that possible, and how? I asked ChatGPT to break it down for me, given the current state of crypto. It made clear that its answer does not constitute financial advice, but rather “a structured way to think about the opportunity and risk.”\n\nChatGPT took a realistic look at what “getting rich” actually means in the crypto space. It was clear that it doesn’t mean “guaranteed 100% returns by New Year,” as the crypto market is extremely volatile, risky and speculative.\n\nRealistic goals might look like a 5% to 10% return on your core position — the main portion of your crypto portfolio held in more established assets like bitcoin or ethereum that you plan to keep long term. You might also see a larger potential return on a smaller “moonshot” allocation — a high-risk, high-reward investment in a newer or less proven coin that could spike in value but could just as easily wipe out, too.\n\nAnalysts place wide predictions even on the giants. For example, bitcoin (BTC) is forecasted to be valued between $100,000 and $200,000 in 2026.\n\nFind Out: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You\n\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n\nBased on current expert commentary and fundamentals, ChatGPT said there are two categories of coins with the best shot at making you rich across two strategies.\n\nUnsurprisingly, bitcoin (BTC), the most well-known coin, remains the leading choice. Many forecasts assume it will stay dominant. However, ethereum (ETH), the runner-up, is seen as more utility-based, and some analysts believe it may outperform BTC in certain phases.\n\nIn either case, these coins are less about “getting rich quick” and more about a reasonable chance of strong returns at moderate risk, the AI said.\n\nSome investors are turning to altcoins — smaller cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin and ethereum — that could see bigger short-term gains. Coins like XRP and Solana are getting attention for their performance potential, though they come with higher risk, ChatGPT noted. Even newer projects, especially those combining AI and blockchain, promise sky-high returns, but most are highly speculative. Forecasts of 500% profits make headlines, but in reality, very few ever deliver.",

    "description": "When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words.  After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words. But no small part of that oil belongs to China under contracts it struck with Caracas years ago, setting the stage for a delicate diplomatic dance in the next few weeks.\n\nSome experts expect Trump to work with China in an effort to stabilize trade relations. After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.\n\n“The administration appears focused on avoiding unnecessary escalation or new irritants with Beijing while keeping leverage firmly on Washington’s terms,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nHe added that he doubted Trump would risk turning Venezuela into a “flashpoint that complicates trade dynamics or Trump’s personal engagement with Xi.”\n\nChina is owed at least $10 billion from Venezuela, according to various estimates, a debt that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had paid down by shipping oil to China. It is possible that the interim Venezuelan government complying with Washington’s demands could question the legality of those loans-for-oil deals and cease payments.\n\nTwo major Chinese state-owned enterprises — China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec — are entitled to 4.4 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela, the highest for any foreign country, according to a research note by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nU.S. companies also have claims for tens of billions of dollars from when Caracas nationalized the oil industry, and it’s not clear how these IOUs will be honored and in what order.\n\nThe U.S. seized two sanctioned oil tankers this week as part of a plan to assert control over Venezuelan oil shipments. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will handle the sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” depositing proceeds into U.S.-controlled accounts that will ultimately “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThe administration said this week that the U.S. would kickstart those sales with 30 million to 50 million barrels taken from the South American country’s crude storage facilities. Asked for more detail, a Trump administration official not authorized to comment publicly and speaking on condition of anonymity said U.S. policy was to wind down “adversarial outside influence” in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe U.S. using such leverage over a crucial natural resource comes after Beijing flexed its muscles last year by choking off critical supplies of rare-earth magnets and weaponizing its purchase of American soybeans in the trade war with Washington. When Trump met Xi in South Korea in October, the two men agreed to a one-year truce, backing off from sky-high tariffs and export controls on each other.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, Venezuela was the fourth-largest recipient of Beijing's official credit, having received $106 billion worth of loans from China’s official-sector creditors, according to AidData, a research lab at Virginia's College of William & Mary that tracks Beijing's overseas lending activities. But how much of the total that Caracas has paid off and what is still owed is unclear, said AidData executive director Brad Parks, because Caracas stopped reporting debt details several years ago.\n\nWhile some estimates put the outstanding debt at $10 billion, Parks said the figure could be much higher because U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil might have delayed loan repayments. The loans from China, under an unusual arrangement, were set up to be paid down with proceeds from oil exports.\n\nIn China, the capture of Maduro evoked memories of another leader who had struck deals with Chinese companies and then suddenly lost power: Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nAfter the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, Chinese businesses had to leave behind billions in investments. Cui Shoujun, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Chinese news and commentary site guancha.cn that the transition government in Caracas could deem agreements under Maduro unlawful and the debt to China illegal.\n\nAs in Libya, Beijing’s stakes in Venezuela have gone beyond oil. Chinese firms have invested in telecommunications, railways and ports in Venezuela, all now at risk, according to a report by the global financial firm Jefferies.\n\nStill, the firm noted that Beijing will likely manage any disruption because Venezuelan oil counted for only a small percentage of China's oil imports and because Beijing has diversified its energy supplies and pivoted to electrification.\n\nHours before he was captured by U.S. forces, Maduro hosted a high-level Chinese diplomat at the presidential palace and praised the countries' ties that had prospered from the days of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, and given Beijing a strong foothold in America's backyard.\n\nVenezuela is the only Latin American country that has a high-level strategic partnership with China, on par with close friends like Pakistan, and the ouster of Maduro is expected to curtail China's influence in the Western Hemisphere — in line with one of the goals spelled out in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\nBeijing's response to the capture of Maduro\n\nSoon after Maduro was captured, Beijing said it was “deeply shocked” by the blatant use of U.S. force against a sovereign state and action against its president and said it “strongly” condemned the U.S. actions. It called for the immediate release of Maduro and his wife.\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said Thursday that no nation has the right to interfere with economic and trade cooperation between China and Venezuela, which he said is between two sovereign states and protected by international and domestic laws.\n\n“No matter how the political situation in Venezuela evolves, China’s willingness to deepen bilateral economic and trade cooperation will not change,” He said.\n\nSingleton said Beijing does not wield the clout in the Western Hemisphere as touted.\n\n“Beijing can protest diplomatically,” he said, “but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure.”",

    "description": "Rob Reiner's son Nick Reiner's lawyer’s sudden decision to quit is being speculated to be due to financial reasons.",
    "fullText": "Nick Reiner's lawyer's sudden decision to quit is being speculated to be due to financial reasons.\n\nAlan Jackson was representing the accused up until his January 7 arraignment, during which he announced his decision to withdraw from the case. A public defender was subsequently assigned to Nick, and the hearing was rescheduled for February.\n\nNow, insiders have also claimed that Nick Reiner's family has completely cut him off financially and emotionally as they are \"devastated\" and \"cannot support him anymore.\"\n\nThe start of the new year brought the long-anticipated arraignment of Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old accused of killing his celebrity parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Reiner.\n\nHowever, on January 7, when the arraignment took place, his attorney, Alan Jackson, suddenly announced to the court that he was withdrawing from the case.\n\nSources have now shared with British journalist, Rob Shuter's #Shuterscoop, that the alleged killer's family has cut him off.\n\n\"The family has completely cut Nick off,\" a close source said. \"They are devastated. But they realized they cannot support him anymore—not financially, not emotionally, not morally.\"\n\nAnother source stated that Nick behaved badly with his legal team, which may have caused issues with Jackson.\n\n\"Even with the best legal team, a client has to cooperate. Nick's behavior over the past weeks—erratic, threatening, unpredictable—left no other choice. The family can't bankroll chaos,\" the source claimed.\n\n\"They loved him once,\" the insider continued, \"but what he did, what he became… it was monstrous. They can't protect him anymore, and they can't keep funding his destruction.\"\n\nWhile Jackson did not disclose his reasons for quitting, experts suggest that his decision was likely tied to the financial demands of the case.\n\nThe attorney is believed to be among the most sought-after defense attorneys and likely commanded at least a seven-figure retainer.\n\nThis expense, along with future legal costs, may have been too steep for the accused to sustain.\n\n\"Nick Reiner doesn't have the money, if he did, he wouldn't be living in his parents' guesthouse. And under the California Slayer Statute, you kill your parents — you're disinherited,\" said former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani, per the New York Post.\n\nAfter Jackson stepped away from the case, the court appointed public defender Kimberly Greene to represent the accused.\n\nThe arraignment has since been pushed to February, meaning Nick's plea remains unknown for now.\n\nThere has also been no indication that Nick's family plans to retain another private attorney.\n\nAccording to Seth Zuckerman, a defense lawyer who once represented actor Jonathan Majors in a domestic violence case, this is further proof that Jackson's exit may have been financially motivated.\n\n\"If they had the financial resources, they would go hire another private attorney,\" Zuckerman said of Nick's family.\n\nCriminal defense attorney Mark Bederow also shared similar sentiments as Rahmani and Zuckerman over Jackson's withdrawal.\n\n\"A representation like this could cost an extraordinary sum of money,\" Bederow said. \"Probably the money is not there.\n\n\"I don't know who is controlling the family assets, but I would imagine that whatever hope there had been from the client or the family, that it's just not there, and the defense costs so much,\" he added.\n\nSince Reiner's arrest in connection with the deaths of his parents, rumors that he could face the death penalty have circulated widely.\n\nThe speculation intensified after District Attorney Nathan Hochman addressed the case during a press conference in December.\n\nAt the time, Hochman stated that the murder counts Nick faces carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty.\n\nHowever, Rahmani and Bederow feel it is unlikely that Hochman will pursue the death penalty if Nick is found guilty.\n\n\"I don't think it will be a death penalty case. We haven't had an execution in California in almost 20 years,\" Rahmani said.\n\n\"There is no way this is going to end up being a death penalty case,\" Bederow also stated. \"I don't think the Reiner family would want that.\"\n\nIn line with Bederow's suggestion, the Reiner family has seemingly voiced their displeasure over the possibility of the death penalty.\n\nA source close to the family recently shared that they feel \"Nick is seriously ill,\" and ending his life will in no way bring back his late parents.\n\n\"They believe killing him won't bring Rob and Michele back — and it won't fix what went wrong,\" the insider told Rob Shuter's #ShuterScoop last month.\n\nAs the case proceeds, the family will also fight back against any recommendations for the death penalty and would prefer that Nick be offered mental help if he is eventually found guilty.\n\n\"Justice, to them, means treatment, accountability, and making sure this never happens again,\" a different source said, seemingly referencing the recent discovery of Nick's schizophrenia. \"Another death isn't justice.\"",

The college student was found dead at the bottom of an apartment complex. The Austin Police Department suggested that Aguilera took her own life, though the cheerleader's mother strongly disagreed.\n\nStephanie Rodriguez, the mother of the deceased cheerleader, ripped Austin Police for their investigation.\n\n“Please don’t believe this lazy investigator and Investigation!” Stephanie Rodriguezwrote on Facebook.\n\nNow, the parents of the cheerleader have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Austin Blacks Rugby Club and the University of Texas’ Latin Economics and Business Association. The seven-figure lawsuit accuses the two school organizations of allegedly serving their daughter alcohol before her death.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Aguilera was served her first drink around 6 p.m. She was allegedly continued to be served drinks for several hours, before stumbling away. Aguilera ended up at an apartment where she was supposed to spend the night. Ultimately, she fell to her death around midnight.\n\n“We believe even more today this was not a suicide as has been suggested by police. This was either an accident or something much more sinister,” Tony Buzbee, lead attorney with the Buzbee Law Firm, who is representing Aguilera’s parents, said at a press conference.\n\nHe added: “If the police department will not do its job, then we will do it for them.\"\n\nThe police said that they found a deleted suicide note on Aguilera's phone. However, attorneys representing Aguilera's family say that it was just a drafted essay.\n\nAn official cause of death has yet to be released. An investigation into the death remains to be underway.",

    "fullText": "Lewis Crocker is unlikely to put his IBF welterweight title on the line at Windsor Park after he was ordered to make a mandatory defence of his belt against Liam Paro.\n\nThe Belfast fighter had been set for a voluntary defence at Windsor, with opponents such as Devin Haney, Conah Walker and Jack Catterall all considered, before the governing body's decision to make Paro the mandatory challenger.\n\nIt will be Crocker's first defence of the title he claimed after a split-decision win over Paddy Donovan in front of a sold-out crowd at Northern Ireland's national football stadium in September.\n\nCrocker's victory over Donovan marked boxing's return to Windsor Park for the first time since Carl Frampton's victory over Luke Jackson in August 2018, but the SSE Arena in Belfast is the frontrunner to host the defence now, with dates in April being considered.\n\nThe 29-year-old, who is unbeaten in 22 professional bouts, has not fought since that September win and recently split from coach Billy Nelson.\n\nHis bout against Paro will be his first under new coach Huzaifah Iqbal.\n\nParo, 29, was due to fight Donovan in a final eliminator for the mandatory position for the IBF belt on 16 January in Brisbane, but the Limerick man pulled out through illness.\n\nThe Australian held the super IBF lightweight title in 2024, beating Puerto Rico's Subriel Matias by a unanimous decision to clinch the belt.\n\nHe was then beaten by American Richardson Hitchins six months later in his sole career defeat.\n\nParo moved up to welterweight in 2025, where he has since earned wins over Jonathan Navarro and David Papot.",

    "description": "Nearly 16,000 nurses set to join union-led strike Monday to demand large hospitals across NYC ‘put patients over profit’",
    "fullText": "Nearly 16,000 nurses in New York City are set to strike on Monday amid a battle over pay during contract negotiations.\n\nThe action, due to take place across five large hospitals, is being organized by the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA), which is demanding the hospitals put patients over profit.\n\nThe hospitals insist they continue to bargain in good faith, and have accused the union of trying to disrupt patient care.\n\nCEO compensation at three hospitals – Montefiore, Mount Sinai, and New York Presbyterian – is nearly 12,000 times more than that of the average nurse, according to the union.\n\nNancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, who has worked at Maimonides medical center in Brooklyn for over 30 years, told the Guardian that the hospitals are pushing to scale back safe staffing ratios, refusing to guarantee healthcare benefit coverage for nurses, and declining to address workplace safety issues.\n\nThree of the major hospitals involved in contract negotiations have $1.6bn cash or cash equivalent on hand, according to the union, which said they have already started hiring travel nurses to replace those striking in preparation for a strike.\n\n“What we are asking them is to take those millions and invest it into the community so we could continue to work to care for our patients, invest it into staffing, invest those millions into our medical coverage so we could come to work,” said Hagans. “We’re not taking this lightly. We’re not asking to strike. Management is the one who’s telling us that we need to strike. They are the ones putting us on the picket line.”\n\nShe cited safety issues that stem from a drastic increase of assaults on healthcare workers since the Covid-19 pandemic, and an active shooter incident at Mount Sinai last November, where three nurses were reportedly disciplined for speaking out afterwards.\n\n“The large, wealthy hospitals are much better off financially than they were three years ago, but yet they’re asking for takeaways,” claimed Hagans. “They told us to choose between our wages or keeping our healthcare and safe staffing, because we cannot have it all. The safety of a patient should never be a bargaining chip. Nurses will not cut corners on patients and their safety. Nurses are just demanding that New York City private hospitals put patients over profit.”\n\nNurses represented by NYSNA issued 10-day strike notices on 2 January at a string of New York hospitals. On Tuesday, seven of the smaller hospitals moved forward in contract negotiations, with the union rescinding their strike notice.\n\nAbout 1,000 nurses at three Northwell hospitals in Long Island have also issued strike notices.\n\n“Our nurses have been at the bargaining table since September 2025 with little to no movement,” said Simone Way, a member of the NYSNA executive committee, and a nurse at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital. “Even though we started this process in September, there have been committees in the hospital having these same discussions on staffing since January 2025, so it’s no surprise to our management the things nurses feel we need.”\n\nWay also criticized hospital management’s efforts to blame the strike on nurses, claiming they are putting patients at risk and asking for too much. “They do have the money, but they don’t appear to be willing to invest that money in their nurses or into the ability for us to provide the best care humanly possible to our patients,” she said.\n\nMount Sinai denied retaliation claims against nurses following November’s active-shooter incident, and denied attempting to take away healthcare benefits for nurses. A spokesperson said: “We are continuing to bargain in good faith in the hopes of reaching an agreement that is fair, reasonable, and responsible, but unfortunately just a week before a potential strike NYSNA has refused to move off of its extreme economic proposals that demand hospitals like ours spend billions of dollars on increased nursing compensation and additional hires.”\n\nThey claimed “most of the union’s claims about bargaining are untrue”, and confirmed that the hospital is taking steps to prepare in case of a strike.\n\nNew York Presbyterian blamed the union for not budging on wages. “NYSNA’s threatened strike is intended to disrupt patient care across the city,” a spokesperson said. “We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our patients will continue to receive safe, exceptional care. We will always meet our fundamental obligation to the communities we serve.”\n\nMontefiore did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.

The effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.",
    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael said the development was encouraging but “far from sufficient,\" and its Foreign Ministry said the group still has dozens of compounds and other infrastructure.\n\nThe effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.\n\nThe military's statement, which did not name Hezbollah or any other armed groups, came before President Joseph Aoun met with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and his government to discuss the deployment and disarmament plans. Both said disarming non-state groups was a priority upon beginning their terms not long after the ceasefire went into effect.\n\nLebanon's top officials have endorsed the military announcement.\n\nA statement by Aoun’s office ahead of the Cabinet meeting called on Israel to stop its attacks, withdraw from areas it occupies, and release Lebanese prisoners. He called on friendly countries not to send weapons to Lebanon unless it's to state institutions — an apparent reference to Iran which for decades has sent weapons and munitions to Hezbollah.\n\nSpeaker Nabih Berri, a key ally of Hezbollah who played a leading role in ceasefire talks, issued a statement saying the people of southern Lebanon are “thirsty for the army's presence and protection.\"\n\nIsrael maintains that despite Lebanon’s efforts, Hezbollah is still attempting to rearm itself in southern Lebanon.\n\n“The ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States between Israel and Lebanon states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,\" a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office read. “This is imperative for Israel’s security and Lebanon’s future.”\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry said in a later statement that the group is “rearming faster than it is being disarmed,\" and showed a map of alleged Hezbollah compounds, launch sites, and underground networks south of the Litani River.\n\nPlan to restrict weapons at an ‘advanced stage’\n\nThe text of the ceasefire agreement is vague as to how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani River should be treated, saying Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river.\n\nHezbollah insists that the agreement only applies south of the Litani, while Israel maintains that it applies to the whole country. The Lebanese government has said it will eventually remove non-state weapons throughout the country.\n\nThe agreement is seen as a procedure to implement prior United Nations Security Council agreements that call for disarmament of non-state groups and the withdrawal of all occupying forces, and for the Lebanese state to have full control of its territory.\n\nInformation Minister Paul Morcos said after the Cabinet meeting that the army will start working on a plan for disarmament north of the Litani river that will be discussed by the government in February. He added that the army will also continue the process of weapons “containment” in other parts of Lebanon, meaning that they will not be allowed to be used or moved.\n\nThe Lebanese military has been clearing tunnels, rocket-launching positions, and other structures since its disarmament proposal was approved by the government and went into effect in September.\n\nThe government had set a deadline of the end of 2025 to clear the area south of the Litani River of non-state weapons.\n\n“The army confirms that its plan to restrict weapons has entered an advanced stage, after achieving the goals of the first phase effectively and tangibly on the ground,” the military statement read. “Work in the sector is ongoing until the unexploded ordnance and tunnels are cleared ... with the aim of preventing armed groups from irreversibly rebuilding their capabilities.”\n\nHezbollah did not immediately comment on the Lebanese announcement.\n\nOfficials have said the next stage of the disarmament plan is in segments of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which include Lebanon’s port city of Sidon, but they have not set a timeline for that phase.\n\nIsrael continues to strike Lebanon near daily and occupies five strategic hilltop points along the border, the only areas south of the Litani where the military said it has yet to control.\n\nRegular meetings have taken place between the Lebanese and the Israelis alongside the United States, France, and the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to monitor developments after the ceasefire.\n\nLebanon’s cash-strapped military has since been gradually dispersing across wide areas of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the U.N.-demarcated “Blue Line” that separates the tiny country from Israel. The military has also been slowly confiscating weapons from armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps.\n\nIsrael accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its battered military capacity and has said that the Lebanese military’s efforts are not sufficient, raising fears of a new escalation. Lebanon, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes and control of the hilltops were an obstacle to the efforts.\n\nLebanon also hopes that disarming Hezbollah and other non-state groups will help to bring in money needed for reconstruction after the 2024 war.\n\nHezbollah says it has been cooperative with the army in the south but will not discuss disarming elsewhere before Israel stops its strikes and withdraws from Lebanese territory.\n\nThe latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah, largely based in southern Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024. Israeli strikes killed much of Hezbollah's senior leadership and left the group severely weakened.\n\nHezbollah still has political clout, holding a large number of seats in parliament representing the Shiite Muslim community and two cabinet ministers.",

It's a little bit like since I've been here, a never-ending story, when you have a team together and you try to grow and give them confidence and you can make the same starting 11.\n\n\"Then you have new injuries. But I think in the last couple of weeks, we did well, we always find again, a solution.\n\n\"I think it's not just Connor. The relationship with Nico (Raskin) was very special when you look on the pitch that was very fluid, that helped each other on the pitch, then in the last two games you saw as well, Dio (Mohamed Diomande), this three-man midfield was very strong.\n\n\"They dictate the rhythm, they won a lot of balls, and this is what we, of course, miss, but it's time then for maybe other players to step in and take the responsibility.\"",

    "description": "The coldest air will be short-lived. By midweek, most of Florida is expected to be back to a more normal winter weather routine.",
    "fullText": "A vigorous cold front is forecast to slide through Florida with confidence increasing that the pulse of winter chill will be felt all the way to the Keys.\n\nThe Canadian-cooled air is expected to reach the Panhandle on Sunday, Jan. 11 with wind chill temperatures possibly plummeting into the 20s during the early morning hours of Monday, Jan. 12 and daytime highs reaching only into the low 50s.\n\nIn the southern reaches of the state, low temperatures could dip into the upper 40s to mid-50s inland with the lower 60s felt along the water-warmed coasts. Daytime highs should hover around 70 degrees early in the week for much of South Florida.\n\nWhile meteorologists aren’t expecting the same slap of frigid temperatures that welcomed in the New Year — West Palm Beach got socked by a mercury reading of 39 degrees on Dec. 31 — it will be a change from more recent record-challenging heat:\n\nApalachicola sizzled at 77 degrees on Jan. 7, tying its record warm temperature set for that day in 1974.\n\nMiami reached 82 degrees, a full 6 degrees warmer than normal but below the 87-degree record set for that day in 2017.\n\nFort Pierce, on the Treasure Coast, was 84 degrees Jan. 7. That's 9 degrees above normal and near the record high of 86 set in 1990.\n\n“Everyone is talking about how warm it is and I’m thrilled with it. I love really warm weather,” said Lynn Murphy, who was working the front desk at the Driftwood Inn in the Panhandle city of Mexico Beach. “The high today (Jan. 8) is supposed to be 73 and I’m in long sleeves wishing I had a jacket.”\n\nMore: Dense fog blankets Florida: Advisories from the Panhandle to Miami\n\nThe cold front is attached to a zippy area of low pressure that will move northeast with a mix of rain and snow for areas from Michigan to Maine.\n\nRain chances increase for the western reaches of the Panhandle on Friday, Jan. 9, with up to an 80% chance of showers in Pensacola on Saturday, Jan. 10.\n\nAnd while North Florida could get whacked with temperatures in the upper 30s, the chill will moderate as it moves down the Peninsula.\n\n“Crystal River, Cedar Key, maybe Gainesville will be near the southern edge of the colder temperatures below 40 degrees,” said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. “It’s not a pure Arctic air mass but will be a return of a typical winter weather pattern.”\n\nA swirl of high pressure has dominated the southeast, pumping tropical air into more northerly latitudes, and allowing temperatures to rise. Weather gauges monitored by the Southeast Regional Climate Center have the average temperatures from Pensacola to Leesburg west of Daytona Beach at up to 9 degrees warmer than normal this month.\n\nEast coast cities from Miami to Vero Beach are still recovering from the New Year’s chill with temperatures between 1 and 2 degrees below normal since Jan. 1.\n\n“This won’t be like what we saw last time,\" said Miami-based National Weather Service meteorologist George Rizzuto trying to temper expectations. “We will see slightly reduced humidity and slightly reduced temperatures. The parent cyclone is going to be too far to the northeast.”\n\nThe coldest air will be short-lived. By midweek, most of Florida is expected to be back to a more normal winter weather routine.\n\nKimberly Miller is a journalist for the USA TODAY NETWORK FLORIDA.

    "description": "NFL analyst Phoebe Schecter gives her predictions as this season's play-offs begin with Wildcard Weekend.",
    "fullText": "This season's NFL play-offs begin at the weekend and here BBC columnist Phoebe Schecter gives her predictions for the six games on Wildcard Weekend.\n\nAll kick-off times GMT, Conference seed in brackets\n\nLos Angeles Rams (5) @ Carolina Panthers (4) - 21:30\n\nThis is a rematch from week 13, but I don't think it's fair to look at that 31-28 win for the Panthers. They managed to stay alive in the play-off hunt but their defence has kind of been the reason they've stayed in most of their games, rather than their quarterback Bryce Young.\n\nThe Rams are one of the Super Bowl favourites and I think their defence is going to be the final nail in the coffin for Carolina.\n\nMatt Stafford is one of the leading MVP contenders and Puka Nacua leads the league for receptions. He's just so physical in taking contested catches. His one-handed catches are incredible.\n\nThe Rams have struggled in the red zone in recent weeks without Davante Adams but he's set to come back so, for me, it's a clear Rams win.\n\nGreen Bay Packers (7) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 01:00 Sun\n\nThis is going to be awesome. They're divisional rivals and it's the NFL's oldest rivalry, so there's so much familiarity. That's what makes it so exciting.\n\nThey've played each other twice in the last five weeks and they're 1-1. The Packers almost beat the Bears in week 16, and that was after Micah Parsons' injury and being without Jordan Love for most of the game (concussion).\n\nCaleb Williams is doing such a great job with his game management, his athleticism, the way the ball just jumps out of his hand, and his receivers are coming together, so I have the Bears on this one.\n\nThey have had the most fourth-quarter comebacks in a season (six) and their defence leads the league with 33 takeaways. They'll probably need to get a couple more against Jordan Love to really seal the deal.\n\nLive text commentary on all play-off games on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live radio commentary on selected games on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. The Whole 10 Yards, BBC Sport's weekly NFL programme, will also follow the road to Super Bowl 60\n\nBuffalo Bills (6) @ Jacksonville Jaguars (3) - 18:00\n\nWith Kansas City, Cincinnati and Baltimore not in the play-offs, this is the clearest route to the Super Bowl the Bills have had, but this is a scary Jags team.\n\nThey've won their last eight, so they're the team that has momentum. They're having fun out there, and we've never seen this version of Trevor Lawrence before, the way he's finishing in the red zone. He looks so confident.\n\nThe Jags have been clicking on all three phases since their bye week. They brought in Jakobi Myers and the Bills have to stop Travis Etienne running all over them.\n\nBut I still have so much faith in Josh Allen. We've seen it so many times, where he comes to life in the fourth quarter, and it's hard to bet against him. So I'm going for my Bills, especially because I'll be working at the game – and I can't stand the thought of them losing!\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (6) @ Philadelphia Eagles (3) - 21:30\n\nGiven their injuries, coach Kyle Shanahan has been incredible to get the 49ers where they are. They have done a great job of staying afloat with their defence, but I just don't know how sustainable it is.\n\nHaving slipped from potentially the top seed to the sixth, Shanahan's been like 'we've just got to do it the hard way'. This must mean so much to them because of the 2023 NFC Championship game in Philly, when Brock Purdy got injured and Christian McCaffrey had to play quarterback.\n\nI don't think the Eagles are going to do anything fancy. They're going to run the ball, get the play-action to throw outside to their receivers and then play great defence.\n\nIt's not cute, it's not exciting, but they just know how to win. I have a lot of faith in Jalen Hurts and their defence, so I'm going Eagles.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (7) @ New England Patriots (2) - 01:00 Mon\n\nPlaying at New England is tough in the cold and I think that makes a big difference. I don't know how much further the Patriots will go, but I think they'll win this.\n\nJustin Herbert's been hit so many times. The Chargers' offensive line has just not been able to protect him. Like the Bills, their receivers haven't been able to get separation. It's like Herbert's the magic man again, whereas at least the Patriots have some receivers, and Drake Maye has been phenomenal.\n\nI think he's earned the MVP because it's a great story. He's with a franchise that's not been itself since Tom Brady left and it's unbelievable what he's done in his second year.\n\nYou can only say their schedule has been easy so many times. You still have to beat the teams in front of you, and he's been decisive, he's stepping up in the pocket and the way he throws the ball is beautiful.\n\nWhy the NFL play-offs are the 'most unusual' in years\n\nHouston Texans (5) @ Pittsburgh Steelers (4) - 01:00 Tue\n\nThe Steelers' win on Sunday was wild, but I think we have the same conversation around them every year. Mike Tomlin's done a great job, they've got a winning record again and got to the play-offs, but for so long it's not been more than that.\n\nI'm going for the Texans because of their defence, it's just ferocious. Danielle Hunter has 15 sacks, Will Anderson is second in the NFL with a career-high 85 QB pressures, and they have four players with four interceptions. That's a crazy stat - which of their defensive backs do you throw towards?\n\nAaron Rodgers is doing tons trying to get the Steelers' offence on the same page but they're still having miscues. DK Metcalf is back from suspension but I just don't see them having enough firepower to compete with this defence.\n\nIt's the main reason the Texans could make it deep into the play-offs. They can cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The FA Cup is still the greatest cup competition in the world and the third round is still a special weekend in the football calendar but, speaking from a manager's perspective, it has become more complicated over the years than it used to be.\n\nThe Premier League now overrides the fixture schedule, and I'm afraid the importance of the FA Cup has diminished somewhat because of that, especially when your club's top-flight status and entire financial footing is at stake.\n\nLike most things in life today, money talks and the Premier League without doubt now does most of the talking.\n\nWith three European league competitions as well, and the number of games and teams involved there, the FA Cup has fallen even further down the pecking order.\n\nWith the number of games now being played, something has to give and it is usually the FA Cup. As a manager, I understood why - even though I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when it was considered very special by everyone - and this year will be no different.\n\nAfter a busy festive period and another round of games in midweek this week, the games this weekend will be looked on by the Premier League teams as a chance to rest some of their players, and in some cases all of them!\n\nIt's sad to see, even if it could lead to opportunities for smaller clubs to join the band of giantkillers which the competition has become famous for down the years.\n\nI have experienced both sides of the coin. When we were promoted to the Premier League in 2008, Stoke initially struggled and at the turn of the year, when we came to a third-round tie at League One side Hartlepool, I changed practically the whole team.",

But manager John Rooney said recent events have put things into perspective.\n\nRooney took it upon himself to contact every member of the squad when the news was confirmed.\n\n\"Nothing can prepare you for that,\" Rooney told BBC Sport. \"When you have to ring every player individually and tell them, I can't explain what it felt like.\n\n\"I wanted to take that on. I didn't want people ringing different players. I wanted to be the one to tell that news.

    "description": "When Prince Naseem Hamed met actor Pierce Brosnan in the lead-up to a new film, it brought back thoughts of a reconciliation with trainer Brendan Ingle that never happened.",
    "fullText": "An imagined moment gave Prince Naseem Hamed the vision of what reality could have been.\n\nThe reconciliation with Brendan Ingle which never occurred is a pivotal part of Giant, the biopic about the pair.\n\nA regret the former world champion has learned to live with is that he never got the chance to make peace in person with his trainer and mentor.\n\n\"I always wanted that to happen,\" Hamed, now 51, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But to see it unfold in front of me like it could have happened... I actually said to the director and the producer: 'I only wish that that last scene was really true, because I would have wanted that'.\n\n\"Because I was with him for like 18 years.\"\n\nGiant, the new film starring Pierce Brosnan and Amir El-Masry, retells the coach and fighter's relationship. The story charts Hamed's rise from a seven-year-old growing up in Sheffield to a multi-millionaire global superstar under Ingle's guidance.\n\nThe movie, released in UK cinemas on 9 January, delves into how Hamed became a world featherweight champion by 21 and then the fallout with the Ireland-born coach later on.\n\nTheir relationship became strained as Hamed and his family grew irritated by the trainer's agreed 25% cut of his fight purses as they started to become big numbers.\n\nThen a 1998 book, The Paddy and The Prince, written by Nick Pitt, completely soured the relationship. They split not long after Hamed's win over Wayne McCullough in the same year. It was a bitter parting.\n\nAs years passed and Hamed's career finished, he tried \"many times\" to reconnect with Ingle but the legendary trainer did not want to meet.\n\nIn 2018, Ingle died aged 77 and Hamed never got the chance to make amends. He could only deliver a public tribute to the man who had helped him reach the top of the world.\n\n\"He didn't want to have that final kind of meeting and to have to clear the air with it,\" Hamed said.\n\n\"If I was to say to you that there's no regret and I don't care, I'd be lying. Because I've got a heart and I felt like I started at the age of seven with him.\n\n\"He laid down the fundamentals and he taught me stuff from a very young age that I can never just not include - I can't say it was on my own and it was just a God-given talent.\n\n\"I have to mention him in a good way, not because I have to, because I want to.\"",

    "fullText": "Our fitness expert clocked up his indoor miles to put the best exercise bikes, including simple spin machines and gym-quality models, to the test\n\nThe best treadmills for your home, tested\n\nCycling has the potential to benefit your health in myriad ways, whether it’s the mood-boosting properties of inhaling fresh air, the social element of riding with friends or the simple act of improving cardiovascular fitness with every pedal stroke.\n\nThe UK weather doesn’t always play ball, though, so for those who don’t want a dire forecast to result in a missed workout, indoor training replicates the exercise (if not the fresh air).\n\nThe best exercise bikes are not only fantastic for burning a few calories without donning all the outdoor gear, but they can also help you nail training goals if you’re a more serious rider. With many letting you connect your phone or laptop to make the most of online training tools, it’s never been easier or more enjoyable to work out from your home.\n\nI tested 12 exercise bikes, including the sort you might find in a commercial gym, along with more dedicated riding simulators and recumbent models for those who find it tricky to sit hunched forward for any length of time. The resulting list features those that I think performed best.\n\nWhile I’ve tried to appeal to a wide range of budgets, it’s difficult to recommend much under the £500 mark because the build quality of these cheaper models is often not worth the investment.\n\nBest exercise bike overall:\n\n Peloton Bike+\n\nBest budget exercise bike for beginners:\n\n Horizon 3.0SC indoor cycle\n\nBest compact exercise bike:\n\n Wattbike Proton\n\nBest gym-quality exercise bike: \n\n Technogym bike\n\nBest recumbent exercise bike:\n\n LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycle\n\nWhile I no longer compete in official cycling events, I still consider myself a keen cyclist, often heading out with friends on a gravel bike, even if those rides now end in a warm pub, rather than a timed finish line. But when the weather isn’t playing ball, I’ll get stuck into a home- or gym-based exercise bike session to keep fit and stay in shape for when cycling season comes back around again.\n\nHaving tested exercise equipment for numerous publications, I’m always one to get stuck in and test a product for as long as possible. With exercise bikes, this meant getting plenty of hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\n\nExercise bikes are bulky items that typically require an element of setup or construction. To make testing so many of them viable, I either borrowed a pre-assembled machine for one or two weeks or tested the bikes in a dedicated boutique or workout space.\n\nDuring each test, I used any workout modes that were available, syncing a smartphone or laptop to take advantage of third-party software or online classes, if these were offered. The machines were judged on their build quality, features, ease of setup and storage (some companies offer premium white glove deliveries), as well as the overall adjustability or suitability for numerous members of the household.\n\nAfter slipping into a pair of fetching cycling shoes, I assessed noise levels with a smartphone-based decibel meter, and made more subjective assessments on the general ride feel, comfort and the overall quality of the workout experience.\n\nMany rivals have attempted to imitate Peloton, but few have managed to nail its overall experience. Above all, the brand is unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes, offering so many options – from a quick 15-minute spin class to hardcore sportive training, and all led by motivating instructors and accompanied by thumping soundtracks.\n\nThe Bike+ is the premium one of the brand’s two exercise bikes and has a 23.8in (huge!) high-definition display, which can be rotated for workouts that involve movements off the machine. There’s also an automatic resistance knob that adjusts to match the levels recommended by instructors during classes.\n\nIt’s expensive, with a £45-a-month “all access” membership fee on top, but for engaging, interactive workouts pitched at a wide range of users, nothing else comes close.\n\nWhy we love it\nAlthough the Bike+ isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as some of its rivals, it’s comfortable, easy to adjust and not too imposing in any room. It also has wheels, so it is relatively easy to tip on its end and move around.\n\nThe touchscreen on the Bike+ is of excellent quality and the sound from its built-in speakers is impressive, but it’s the array of classes that makes Peloton so alluring. Unlike many rivals, which can feel prescribed, mundane and overly technical, Peloton somehow makes a gruelling 45-minute spin session feel enjoyable.\n\nThe weighted flywheel and belt-drive system are quiet enough to not disturb others in the household, although hardcore road cyclists will probably balk at the Bike+ for its lack of cycling realism and the bouncy, frenetic spin-class nature of many of its workouts.\n\nIt doesn’t play nicely with third-party cycling apps – such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad – either, so, if that’s important to you, look at the Wattbike Proton below instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t feel as realistic as some rivals, and there’s a monthly fee to access the classes and features\n\nDimensions: 56 x 137 x 152cm (WLH) \nWeight: 65kg \nDrivetrain: belt-drive with magnetic, digital resistance adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5, ANT+, wifi (2.4GHz and 5GHz)\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg \nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, 23.8in rotating HD touchscreen with Peloton classes, Netflix, Disney+ and more\n\nAt the time of writing, the Horizon 3.0SC Indoor Cycle cost £569.99, making it one of the cheapest exercise bikes I tested. But it certainly doesn’t feel cheap or any less capable than many of the other exercise bikes I poured sweat upon.\n\nThe 3.0SC has an ultra-smooth, front-mounted flywheel that uses electronically adjustable magnetic resistance to provide 32 effort levels. All of this is controlled via a funky and futuristic-looking digital dial that responds quickly to inputs – great for jumping out of the saddle during high-intensity efforts.\n\nAlthough this is predominantly designed for use in spin classes, its ergonomically cushioned seat and easy-adjust handlebars make it a comfortable spot to pedal away the hours. Oh, and it’s whisper-quiet too, registering just 32dB during my testing.\n\nIt may not be the sort of thing I’d use to train for an upcoming cycling sportive, but it’s a well-priced tool for hitting daily fitness goals.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe 3.0SC looks great. It even blasts out eight vibrant colours from its flywheel, depending on the RPM and amount of effort you are putting in, adding a bit of Tron-like sci-fi to any room.\n\nAnd aside from its relatively compact proportions and lightweight build, the bike is also well connected, playing nicely with Zwift, Kinomap and other third-party fitness apps. There are more realistic-feeling bikes out there, but if you swap out the pedals for a dedicated clipless system, it’s a fairly convincing road bike. Space between the cranks, for example, is as narrow as possible, making it ride like a genuine road machine.\n\nIf you’re looking for on-demand fitness classes, you can find these via Horizon’s free atZone workout app. Pair your phone or tablet with the bike, mount it to the secure plastic holder at the front of the bars, and you’re good to go. For a free service, there’s an impressive amount of content, and it’ll track your progress over time.\n\nIt’s a shame that … there isn’t an integrated display, meaning you’ll have to bring a tablet or smartphone for any instructor-led workouts.\n\nDimensions: 52 x 107 x 120cm (WLH) \nWeight: 36kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with ECB (eddy current) magnetic, electronic resistance (32 levels)\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5 (FTMS compatible for app integration) \nFolding: no (but features transport wheels)\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 100kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder and syncs with training apps\n\nWattbike is probably best known for its original red, white and black Air bike machines, which can be found in gyms and health clubs up and down the country. The company has since ventured into home-workout territory, and the Proton sits somewhere in the middle of its range, offering a lightweight, compact footprint and support for popular third-party training apps, including Zwift and TrainingPeaks.\n\nRacy looks and confusing workout programmes may risk putting off more casual users, but the Proton is designed to appeal to all of the family – comfortably adjusting for those between 4ft 6in and 6ft 6in tall. It’s not as quiet as some of its rivals, but the Proton feels realistic to ride and even has an auto-adjusting ergometer mode (ERG), so it can simulate gradients and gear changes without you having to lift a finger.\n\nWhy we love it\nWattbike has done an admirable job in retaining a realistic bike feel on such a lightweight and compact machine, with a fully adjustable seat post, saddle and handlebars that make it easy to set up to your requirements. I was able to quickly swap the standard toe-cage pedals for some Shimano clipless ones, which improved my performance and gave me greater control over pedal stroke. Most exercise bikes will allow you to swap the pedals, which takes about five minutes if you have the correct spanner or hex key. Adding cleats and pedals allows you to don a dedicated cycling shoe, which provides better power transfer between the legs and pedals compared with basic adjustable toe cages.\n\nWattbike’s background in working with pro athletes is evident from the Wattbike Hub app, which offers real-time feedback on pedal stroke and efficiency, among other nerdy data fields. The app has been tweaked to appeal to the more casual fitness fanatic, but it’s far from friendly to beginners, and you won’t find the same interactivity you would with a Peloton class. It’s more a case of following graphs and on-screen warnings about form than watching live demos from a bubbly personal trainer.\n\nHowever, there are still plenty of workouts aimed at improving overall health rather than targeting highly trained athletes. And, if you like, you can always mount your iPad in the dedicated holder and binge television or complete a virtual workout session of your choice: the Proton’s Bluetooth FTMS technology means it will work with most third-party apps, such as Zwift, TrainerRoad and Rouvy.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the app isn’t slicker and with more to entice and retain a novice.\n\nDimensions: 57 x 102 x 127cm (WLH)\nWeight: 48kg\nDrivetrain: chain drive with electromagnetic resistance\nMaximum power output: 1,800W\nSimulated grade: up to +25% incline\nConnectivity: ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration)\nFolding: no; includes front transport wheels for ease of movement\nNoise level: about 40dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder\n\nTechnogym has been steadily raising the bar when it comes to smart fitness equipment, with a growing line of connected kit that aims to bring the personal trainer experience to your own home.\n\nClearly designed to take on the likes of Peloton, the Technogym Bike is a stylish machine with a 22in high-definition touchscreen that allows access to a raft of Technogym’s live and on-demand content.\n\nIts compact, svelte frame looks and feels as if it’s aimed at more serious cyclists than Peloton’s offering, and the ride experience is smoother and slightly more natural than its rival. There’s plenty of adjustability for different-size riders, while the included double-sided pedals allow for use with trainers or SPD cycling shoes (a clipless shoe system).\n\nThe built-in screen is crisp and easy to navigate, granting access to entertainment apps, including YouTube and Netflix. It rotates to allow for off-bike sessions, too. However, it’s among the most expensive models I tested, and there’s a further membership fee, starting at £8.99 a month. Ouch.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe riding experience is comfortable without straying too far from a realistic simulation, while the powerful flywheel offers punishing levels of resistance. Technogym has live classes, as with Peloton, but it also appeals to the more hardcore athlete with dedicated training programmes geared towards those with ambitions of tackling the Col de Turini.\n\nIf you’re seeking the best in terms of design and build quality – and your bank balance permits the luxury – you’ll be happy with this bike. It’s a handsome, well-built machine that straddles the line between a dedicated cycling trainer and a spin bike well.\n\nIt also works with most third-party training apps and syncs up neatly with Apple Fitness and Apple Watch via a quick-tap NFC panel. For those totally dedicated to Lycra, Technogym offers an even more expensive Ride model, which feels built to compete with Wattbike and Wahoo’s most serious offerings.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it costs so much, and then Technogym charges yet more for a monthly membership.\n\nDimensions: 59 x 121 x 138cm (WLH)\nWeight: 67kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with magnetic resistance (20 levels)\nSimulated grade: not specified\nConnectivity: supports streaming via external device (eg Chromecast, Fire TV Stick); Apple Watch pairing; Technogym Live integration and third-party apps\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 160kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, rotating display with ability to stream apps (TV shows, movies, games, etc) via smartphone, tablet or laptop\n\nRecumbent bikes are great for those who experience back pain, struggle with past injuries or simply find it daunting or uncomfortable to be perched atop a traditional exercise bike for any length of time. You can achieve the same, low-impact cardio workout while enjoying a more relaxed seating position that takes the pressure off the lower back, leg joints and neck.\n\nLifeFitness is a reputable brand that supplies commercial gym equipment and kit more suited for use at home, with the RS3 sitting between the two. For the money, you get a comfortable, ergonomically fitted seat with backrest, 20 levels of resistance and a step-through design that makes it easy to get on and off. There’s also plenty of adjustment in the seat to get the perfect workout position.\n\nAlthough larger than many more traditional exercise bikes, it can be lifted and moved because of its transport wheels.\n\nWhy we love it\nMore seasoned riders will probably find a recumbent bike a little too laidback, since it’s difficult to transfer maximum power through the cranks from the more relaxed seating position. That said, it’s not really designed for smashing PBs – it’s best placed for longer, low-intensity steady-state cardio sessions.\n\nIt links to Rouvy, Zwift and a bunch of other third-party fitness apps, but the digital offering is otherwise basic, with a handful of built-in and customisable workouts direct from the console. Users can also pair an Apple or Samsung Galaxy Watch for heart-rate tracking and more.\n\nSome recumbent bikes can feel decidedly budget, but that’s not the case here. With excellent build quality and a smooth and quiet ride experience, the RS3 is a comfortable place to work up a sweat without the associated aches and pains.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the Track Connect 2.0 Console is fiddly to use, and there’s no built-in multimedia.\n\nDimensions: 68 x 164 x 131cm (WLH)\nWeight: 69.8kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive magnetic resistance, manual adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth FTMS and NFC for syncing with apps, wireless HR receiver\nFolding: no\nNoise level: under 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 181kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no, 7in LCD display with Track Connect Console allowing external tablet/smartphone streaming and app integration\n\nIf you’re mad for virtual cycling apps such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad, or simply want to replicate that road cycling feel at home, Wahoo’s Kickr Shift is among the best indoor training tools for enthusiasts.\n\nThe saddle, stem height and reach can all easily be adjusted on the fly, and users can even select their desired crank length. Heck, the bike even simulates several electronically assisted gearing group sets from Shimano and Campagnolo, mimicking the way the cogs feel when shifting under load.\n\nIt’s a wonderfully quiet, smooth and powerful machine that works perfectly with dedicated cycling training apps. For those who like to reach for the chamois cream at the weekend, this is the perfect indoor companion.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the Wattbike Proton feels like a slightly more rounded machine for all the family.\n\nDimensions: 78 x 140 x 110cm (WLH); weight: 36kg; drivetrain: belt drive with electromagnetic resistance; maximum power output: 2,200W; simulated grade: +20% incline, -15% decline; connectivity: ANT+, ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth, wifi, Direct Connect; folding: no; noise level: under 30dB; maximum user weight: 113kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen; requires external device for app/display\n\nBest for: a studio spin bike feel at home\n\nAnother Peloton Bike+ rival, NordicTrack’s indoor trainer is an excellent spinning machine for a smooth yet powerful ride, with a solid dose of realistic-feeling resistance that will feel tough even for seasoned cyclists. It also comes with a whopping 24in touchscreen for immersive online sessions.\n\nGranted, the iFit virtual training environment doesn’t quite compete with the Hollywood sheen of a Peloton class, but it gets mightily close, and the physical bike feels accomplished and more modern than Peloton’s slightly frumpy-looking machine.\n\nIts 20% incline to -10% simulated decline means it also doubles up as an excellent and quite realistic road or mountain biking training tool, with interactive videos that allow you to virtually cycle around some of the most beautiful places on Earth.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … iFit just isn’t up to Peloton’s offering, and the multimedia setup isn’t quite as slick.\n\nDimensions: 55 x 143 x 159cm (WLH); weight: 81kg; drivetrain: silent magnetic resistance, 24 digital levels; simulated grade: +20% incline/-10% decline; connectivity: Bluetooth (headphone & HR monitor), wifi (for iFit), USB-C port, app integration via iFit (syncs with Strava, Garmin, Google Fit, Apple Health); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 24in pivoting HD touchscreen with built-in speakers, iFit streaming of workouts, classes, and entertainment apps\n\nBest for: a recumbent bike on a budget\n\nOffering a cheaper alternative to the LifeFitness recumbent above, Schwinn’s more basic model majors in comfort and adjustability but wraps it up in a slightly lighter and cheaper-feeling frame.\n\nThe 5.5in segmented LCD screen takes care of the basics, with several built-in workouts to get you going. And there’s always the option to pair a tablet or smartphone and make use of Zwift and other digital training apps.\n\nIt represents excellent value for money, but don’t expect the same sort of build quality as pricier rivals; the handle-mounted heart-rate monitor was hugely inaccurate during my testing, and there are some cheap plastic covers masking some of the fastening bolts. On that subject, don’t expect a white glove delivery service with something at this price.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s not quite as robust as rivals, and the built-in heart-rate monitor was way out during tests.\n\nDimensions: 69 x 163 x 113cm (WLH); weight: 37kg; drivetrain: belt-driven flywheel with 16 levels of manual magnetic resistance; simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration); wireless heart-rate compatibility (strap not included); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 136kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen for media; includes a 5.5in LCD console (for metrics and programmes) and a media shelf for tablets\n\nBest for: a gym-quality upright bike\n\nThis model treads the line between a serious studio bike, such as the Peloton Bike+ or NordicTrack X24, and something more relaxed. It has a comfy padded seat, oversized self-balancing pedals and a unique handlebar design that allows for multiple hand positions. Despite the upright positioning, the ride feel is realistic, and there are 30 levels of resistance to contend with.\n\nIt’s expensive, given that the XUR digital console isn’t as good as those from Technogym, Peloton and NordicTrack, but this is a solid, reliable and comfortable bit of kit from one of the biggest names in commercial gym equipment.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s an expensive bike with a less impressive digital offering than cheaper rivals.\n\nDimensions: 63 x 122 x 143cm (WLH); weight: 60kg; drivetrain: Exact Force induction brake (electronically adjustable resistance); simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: wifi (entertainment apps, software updates), Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration, HR monitor, headphones), HDMI port, USB (media and charging); folding: no, includes transport wheels; noise level: about 28dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 22in HD touchscreen with apps including Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, web browser, social media, plus tablet/HDMI mirroring\n\nExercise bikes vary wildly in price, with the cheapest models often taking the form of basic upright or spin bikes that focus purely on pedalling, and the most expensive offering large HD touchscreens, automatic resistance adjustments and fully integrated training platforms.\n\nBudget models typically start at £250-£400, but often lack the build quality and adjustability needed for long-term use. At the other end of the spectrum, premium connected bikes – such as those from Peloton, Technogym and NordicTrack – can set you back £2,000 or more, and often require monthly subscriptions on top for interactive classes.\n\nFor most riders, a budget of between £600 and £1,200 is a good place to start for solid build quality, smooth resistance and decent connectivity features without straying into commercial-gym territory.\n\nEven the most compact exercise bikes take up space, with the smallest options measuring about 55 x 120 x 130cm (WLH). While that’s less floor space than a treadmill or cross trainer, you’ll still need clearance around the bike for safe mounting and dismounting, as well as enough ceiling height to remain comfortable when standing on the pedals.\n\nRecumbent bikes, which offer a chair-like riding position, often require more floor space, while upright and indoor cycles are more compact. It might be tempting to look at folding exercise bikes, but they can often be flimsy and offer weak pedal resistance.\n\nThe most important thing is the resistance system: magnetic resistance is smoother, quieter and requires less maintenance than older friction-based systems found on traditional studio spin bikes. Belt-drive systems are also preferable to chain-driven units for their silent, low-maintenance operation.\n\nAdjustability is another key factor – a bike with multiple saddle and handlebar positions will ensure better ergonomics and comfort over long sessions, and it will also fit more members of the household.\n\nFor those who want to stay entertained, connected bikes with integrated screens and app compatibility (Zwift, Peloton, iFit, etc) can make training more engaging. Heart-rate monitoring and Bluetooth/ANT+ connectivity are also useful for tracking progress.\n\nFinally, noise levels are worth considering, especially if you live in a flat or plan to exercise when everyone else is sleeping. Modern magnetic systems are whisper-quiet, making them perfect for shared living spaces.\n\nLeon Poultney has been a consumer technology and automotive journalist for longer than he cares to divulge.

    "fullText": "From cosy museums and tropical islands to nightmarishly difficult adventures – and revamps of favourites including Mario Kart and Pokémon – there’s something for everyone\n\nNintendo’s newest console has been out for a less than a year but it already boasts an impressive catalogue of excellent new games, as well as a variety of enhanced Switch greats. Here’s our selection of the 15 best titles currently on offer, ranging from family favourites to grittier, more adult challenges.\n\nOriginally released in 2020, Nintendo’s lovable life simulator has you cast away on a tropical island, building a home, making friends and inviting other players around for a cup of tea. The new version for Switch 2 (available 15 January) overhauls the visuals and multiplayer connectivity, as well as adding support for the Switch 2 camera.\n\nWhy we love it: “Your days are spent chasing bugs, chopping wood, arranging furniture and watering flowers, not scrounging for food/water/weapons and fighting people.” Read more.\n\nThe beloved ape teams up with his previous kidnap victim Pauline (no hard feelings, obviously) in this literally smashing subterranean adventure. The rules of the platform genre are cast aside as walls and floors are pulverised by Kong’s massive fists.\n\nWhy we love it: “I can see Bananza having a second life as an executive stress reliever; a virtual rage room where you heave exploding boulders at cliffs to reduce them to pockmarked swiss cheese.” Read the full review.\n\nOriginally released in 1997, Final Fantasy Tactics was a battle-focused take on the role-playing adventure series, cutting exploration in favour of tense, contained fight scenes. The Ivalice Chronicles features updated visuals as well as fresh voice acting and difficulty levels, perfectly modernising a PlayStation classic.\n\nWhy we love it: “[It] offers a model for resistance, and also a commentary on the struggle of opposition in such turbulent times.” Read the full review.\n\nThe sequel to 2020’s brilliant mythological action game brings us new lead character Melinoë, a witch who must defeat the god of time and his retinue of sexy, chaotic boss characters. As before, dying returns you to the beginning, but you always reanimate and begin again, lessons learned and experience gained.\n\nWhy we love it: “[Jen] Zee’s new character illustrations are, if anything, likely to inspire even more aggressively thirsty fan art and fanfic. And writer Greg Kasavin’s wonderful script is wittier, wiser and flirtier than ever.” Read the full review.\n\nOne of the biggest hits of 2025, this platform adventure sequel drags insectoid princess Hornet into the haunted realm of Pharloom, where relentless enemies and fiendishly tough puzzles await. Nightmarishly difficult and compelling, it’s up there with the greatest Metroidvania titles of all time.\n\nWhy we love it: “I’m captivated by Silksong. I’ve spent 15 hours on it in three days, and it has made my thumbs hurt.” Read more.\n\nThe first 3D platforming adventure for Hal Laboratory’s long-running hero sees Kirby wake up in a magical world terrorised by a gang of animals known as the Beast Pack. The Switch 2 edition updates the visuals and adds a whole new story.\n\nWhy we love it: “From scaling overgrown tower blocks to navigating ghost-ridden haunted house rides in a creature-infested theme park, it feels endlessly inventive.” Read the full review.\n\nThe follow-up to 2017’s Breath of the Wild returns us to the world of Hyrule, now shattered by a cataclysmic event. Familiar locations are radically changed, fresh secrets and quests are revealed, and a new physics engine lets you build incredible contraptions.\n\nWhy we love it: “The sense of freedom here is intoxicating. The kingdom of Hyrule is vast and full of diversions, and being able to move freely between the skies and the ground down below is a thrill that never wears off.” Read the full review.\n\nA new beginning for Nintendo’s beloved karting series sees a vast open world to race in, alongside gorgeous circuits, cars, characters and abilities. Implementation of the Switch 2’s GameChat system makes online play more sociable – and the music is incredible.\n\nWhy we love it: “It really is an impressively welcoming game, this, generous and detailed and unfailingly fun, different but with the same spirit.” Read the full review.\n\nArguably one of the greatest first-person sci-fi shooters ever made, Metroid Prime was a huge hit on the GameCube in 2002 before receiving a wonderful remaster on the Switch. Series hero Samus Aran finds herself on the poisoned planet of Tallon IV, exploring its haunted biomes and fighting hideous space creatures. Inspired by Ridley Scott’s Alien, it is tense, complex and often scary – things we rarely expect from a Nintendo title.\n\nWhy we love it: “Sometimes, you play a game from a decades ago and think, this might actually hit better now. Metroid Prime Remastered is one of those games.” Read more.\n\nIn the sprawling, Paris-esque Lumiose City, a team of young trainers set out to climb the ranks of the biggest Pokémon tournament in town. Arriving as an eager newcomer, you must help them – and save the city from rogue mega-evolved Pokémon. A fresh, interesting take on the series, with more lively battles, an open world to explore and, of course, hundreds of Poké-friends to make along the way.\n\nWhy we love it: “It looks better than every other Pokémon game I’ve played, and if I could show this to my 11-year-old self playing on a monochrome Game Boy screen, she’d lose her mind.” Read more.\n\nIn the early days of the Apple App Store, Swedish studio Simogo made some of the most fascinating, beautifully designed touchscreen games of all time, from rhythm action platformers to folk horror adventures. This collection brings them all together with extra features, including early prototypes of the games.\n\nWhy we love it: “These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.” Read the full review.\n\nImagine Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, but set in a demonic underworld that you must escape by rolling through bizarre crystalline hellscapes while pulling off bodacious moves. A surreal and spiritual take on the skating sim.\n\nWhy we love it: “Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious ‘gamefeel’ of the actual skateboarding.” Read the full review.\n\nTwo authors – one writing sci-fi, the other fantasy – are sucked into their own stories when a virtual reality machine goes awry. From the makers of the award-winning It Takes Two, this is another cooperative adventure in which players work in tandem to solve ingenious puzzles.\n\nWhy we love it: “One level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns.” Read more.\n\nThe warriors return for another showdown, featuring classic combatants and new fighters, such as drunken boxer Jamie and graffiti ninja Kimberly. The special moves are eye-popping and the gorgeous, hyper-colourful visuals hit you harder than Ryu’s hadouken.\n\nWhy we love it: “It’s bursting at the seams with things to do, assured in its gameplay, and wrapped in a stylish, colourful, confident swagger that the game can absolutely back up.” Read the full review.\n\nDesign the perfect museum then send out explorers to discover artefacts in the latest management game from the makers of the equally great Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. The simulation is complex and demanding but it’s softened by lovely comic touches.\n\nWhy we love it: “Takes all the lessons from the previous games and builds on them to make a thoughtful and hugely entertaining contribution to the management sim genre.” Read the full review.",

    "fullText": "Jan. 8 (UPI) -- Carson Beck took a deep breath and delivered a simple message to Miami teammates Thursday before leading a game-winning drive against Ole Miss and clinching a spot in the College Football Playoff finale:\n\n\"We've got three minutes for the rest of our lives.\"\n\nThe sixth-year quarterback finished the Hurricanes' final drive with his first rushing score since September. The 3-yard run, which came with 19 seconds remaining, lifted the Hurricanes to a 31-27 Fiesta Bowl victory and into their first national title game since 2003.\n\n\"I'm so proud of this team,\" said Beck, who threw for 268 yards and two scores. \"We never flinched in the face of adversity. When we had to respond, we responded.\"\n\nCARSON BECK TAKES THE LEAD FOR THE CANES IN THE NICK OF TIME pic.twitter.com/5ZuJlwISkX— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 9, 2026\n\nThe No. 10 Hurricanes (13-2) and No. 6 Rebels (13-2) exchanged the lead six times, including four times in the fourth quarter of the electric College Football Playoff semifinal in Glendale, Ariz. Neither team led by more than seven points.\n\nBeck's Hurricanes, who dominated time of possession in the first half, nearly unraveled due to dropped passes, penalties and an overall lack of discipline down the stretch, but found chemistry when it mattered most.\n\nThey will battle the top-ranked Indiana Hoosiers or No. 5 Oregon Ducks, the other two semifinalists, for a chance to claim their sixth national crown.\n\n\"We are focused on enjoying this one, but we've gotta get focused on going 1-0 one more time,\" Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal said.\n\nThe Hurricanes out-gained the Rebels 459 to 398 in total yards and held an edge in time of possession of nearly 22 minutes, but also committed 10 penalties and logged the game's lone turnover.\n\nPowerful Hurricanes trench play, with dominant defensive and offensive line performances, muted Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and the Rebels' previously potent offense throughout the first two quarters.\n\nCarter Davis split the uprights for a 38-yard field goal on the Hurricanes' first drive of the night for the only points of the first quarter. Rebels running back Kewan Lacy then gutted the Hurricanes defense with a career-long 73-yard touchdown run 10 seconds into the second quarter.\n\nBut Lacy, who picked up a hamstring injury, didn't see another carry in the first half. Hurricanes running back CharMar Brown scored on a 4-yard run to end the next drive.\n\nRebels kicker Lucas Carneiro tied the score with a 42-yard field goal on the next possession, but the Hurricanes answered with their second score of the night. That score -- a 52-yard pass from Beck to wide receiver Keelan Marion -- and an extra point gave a 17-10 lead for the Hurricanes.\n\nCarneiro made a 58-yard kick just before halftime to cut the deficit to four points at the break.\n\nDavis and Carneiro each missed 51-yard kicks on the first two drives of the second half. Rebels safety Kapena Gushiken snatched a deflected pass for an interception of Beck on the next possession.\n\nCarneiro hit the left upright and bounced in another three points for the Rebels about three minutes later, trimming the deficit to 17-16.\n\nThe Rebels unearthed their pass rush at the start of the fourth quarter, picking up two sacks on the Hurricanes' first drive of the frame. They then put together their longest drive of the night, using 14 plays to get another Carneiro field goal and take back the lead with about seven minutes remaining.\n\nFreshman phenom Malachi Toney took momentum back when he caught a short pass from Beck on the next drive and revved for a 36-yard touchdown, helping the Hurricanes take a 24-19 advantage.\n\nBut Chambliss used his legs and live arm to wrestle back the advantage less than two minutes later. The Rebels quarterback threw a 24-yard dart to tight end Dae'Quan Wright for that score. He followed with a successful two-point conversion throw to wide receiver Caleb Odom for a 27-24 edge with 3:13 remaining.\n\nBeck responded by using 14 plays to get the Hurricanes to the Rebels 3-yard line. He took the next snap, scanned through progressions to his right and darted to a clear patch of grass on his left before finding the end zone with his clutch gallop.\n\nChambliss used the game's final seconds to march the Rebels deep into Hurricanes territory, but his final pass dropped incomplete as time expired.\n\nThe Rebels quarterback completed 23 of 37 passes for 277 yards and a score in the loss. Beck completed 23 of 37 passes for the Hurricanes, including seven completions to Marion, who totaled a game-high 114 yards.\n\nToney amassed 81 yards on five catches, including his touchdown. Hurricanes running back Mark Fletcher Jr. ran for 133 yards on 22 carries. Lacy totaled 103 yards and a score on 11 carries, with the majority of his production coming from his career-long sprint.\n\nOregon (13-1) will meet Indiana (14-0) in the second College Football Playoff semifinal at 7:30 p.m. EST Friday in Atlanta. The winner will face the Hurricanes in the national title game Jan. 19 in Miami Gardens, Fla.",

    "description": "Weather could make it difficult for both quarterbacks, which puts an emphasis on the running game. Maye should get more help in that regard than Justin Herbert.",
    "fullText": "Welcome back to the playoffs, New England Patriots.\n\nThe last time we saw the Patriot Way grace us this deep into January, New England got drilled in Buffalo with Mac Jones leading the way at quarterback in the 2021 season. New England's last postseason home game happened to be the last time we saw Tom Brady in a Patriots uniform, suffering an upset loss to Mike Vrabel and the Tennessee Titans in the 2019 season’s playoffs.\n\nSpeaking of Vrabel, he's back, this time in familiar digs as New England's head coach. But all eyes will be mainly focused on his quarterback, Drake Maye, who is in a tight MVP race with the Los Angeles Rams' Matthew Stafford.\n\nThe Chargers and Patriots didn’t play each other this season. The two teams matched up late in 2024 with Los Angeles winning decisively in New England, 40-7. Maye passed for only 117 yards, his worst game as a full-time starter during his rookie season.\n\nOn the other side, Justin Herbert posted the kind of performance the Chargers will need from him Sunday night. He threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns, two of those scoring passes going to Ladd McConkey, who finished with 94 yards. J.K. Dobbins (now with the Broncos) rushed for 76 yards.\n\nThe Patriots have no major injuries to deal with going into Sunday. But five players missed practice this week due to illness and the team will hope more don’t come down with a bug leading up to kickoff. For the Chargers, starting running back Omarion Hampton — the team’s second-leading rusher — hasn’t practiced all week due to an ankle issue that sidelined him for eight games this season. Edge rusher Bud Dupree has also missed practice.\n\nIt’s Michigan vs. Ohio State on the opposing sidelines.\n\nVrabel is a leading candidate for Coach of the Year honors after turning New England around from a 4-13 slog in 2024 to a 13-4 resurgence this season. He has a 3-5 playoff record, which includes the Tennessee Titans’ run to the AFC championship game in the 2019 season. Harbaugh boasts a 5-4 mark, which includes three consecutive NFC championship games with the San Francisco 49ers and an appearance in Super Bowl XLVII. Yet the Chargers lost in last season’s wild-card round, 32-12, to the Houston Texans.\n\nAs Herbert goes, so do the Chargers. Last season, he threw four interceptions in Los Angeles’ playoff defeat. This season, when he didn’t play well, the Chargers typically couldn’t overcome those poor performances. (The lone exception was Week 14’s 22-19 overtime win over the Philadelphia Eagles, in which Herbert threw for only 139 yards.) However, the Patriots may provide an ideal matchup for Herbert to shine. New England allowed 4,459 passing yards this season and 8.9 yards per throw, both worst in the AFC. And only the Bengals gave up more TD passes (36) this season than the Patriots’ 31 among conference teams.\n\nMaye has been viewed as an MVP candidate throughout the season. But he’ll face the NFL’s fourth-best pass defense (3,314 yards allowed) in the Chargers. Only two other teams had more interceptions than the 19 Los Angeles grabbed this season. So the Patriots may have to run the ball to win. That could suit them well, as they compiled the third-most rushing yards in the AFC. TreVeyon Henderson led the team with 911 yards and nine TDs. He ran for a season-high 148 yards and two scores in Week 15 versus the Bills.\n\nNew England was actually better on the road (8-0) this season than at home (6-3). But temperatures in Foxborough, Massachusetts, are expected to be in the mid-30s by Sunday’s 8 p.m. ET kickoff, which isn’t ideal for a team coming from Los Angeles.\n\nThe conditions could make it difficult for both quarterbacks, which puts an emphasis on the running game. Maye should get more help in that regard than Herbert. The Patriots’ ability to control the line of scrimmage on offense with two talented running backs capable of rushing for 100 yards could be the difference.",

    "fullText": "With Ruben Amorim gone, it will be interesting to see what happens with quite a few Manchester United players.\n\nThe former head coach had overlooked many players while openly criticising a few. Interim boss Darren Fletcher already has those players playing with a lot more freedom.\n\nCase in point — Patrick Dorgu registered an assist against Burnley, Benjamin Sesko grabbed a brace, while Manuel Ugarte impressed in the middle of the park.\n\nKobbie Mainoo came on to replace the struggling Casemiro, while Joshua Zirkzee was also summoned from the bench.\n\nThe Dutchman only started four Premier League games this season, and in one of those games (vs Wolves), he was hooked at half-time despite scoring United’s only goal of the game.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\nAmorim’s treatment had him considering a January move to AS Roma with personal terms even agreed and a contract proposal also on the table.\n\nIt seemed like a foregone conclusion, delayed only due to the absence of United’s AFCON contingent. Things are now different following the ex-Sporting CP boss’ sacking.\n\nAs per the reliable Gianluca Di Marzio, the Red Devils have blocked the Dutchman’s exit, and will only greenlight a move after a new interim manager is in place.\n\nOnce the new caretaker manager takes over, he will have the final say on the former Bologna ace’s future.\n\n“AS Roma, Zirkzee operation still blocked. Roma want to renew the attacking department available to Gian Piero Gasperini and are not limiting themselves to working for Giacomo Raspadori.\n\n“Zirkzee’s situation, however, is still on hold and will remain so until Manchester United decides on their next manager.”\n\nIt makes sense to keep the Netherlands international at the club until then as the new interim boss needs to understand the squad and whether letting a forward go will leave them short.\n\nGiven the club have Champions League aspirations, they cannot afford to leave themselves light for the second half of the campaign.\n\nAs things stand, former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and former coach Michael Carrick are favourites to take charge, but whether they do so as a partnership like before remains to be seen.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff semifinal between Ole Miss and Miami came down to one final Hail Mary. When the dust cleared, a few people seemed to think the officials had missed a key penalty.\n\nWith six seconds remaining and down 31-27, Ole Miss found itself at Miami's 35-yard line and had a chance for one last punch in what was already a wild ending. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss got the ball to the end zone, but wide receiver De'Zhaun Stribling could only get a single, flailing hand on it as it landed.\n\nThe incomplete pass sealed a win for Miami, which will play Indiana or Oregon in the national championship game on Jan. 19.\n\nTHE LAST PLAY THAT SENT MIAMI TO THE CFP NATTY 🏆 pic.twitter.com/xHXFD1iR2B\n\nHowever, quite a few fans noticed some hard contact in the scramble for the ball. Stribling definitely noticed it, as he held up his hands after the play, wondering why a flag wasn't coming.\n\nFurther replay showed Miami defensive back Ethan O'Connor had his hand in Stribling's collar as the ball arrived, and that Stribling was doing something similar to O'Connor.\n\nThis time, no DPI on Miami to close the Fiesta Bowl. pic.twitter.com/byZL6A9OfK\n\n— Connor O'Gara (@cjogara) January 9, 2026\n\nLast play of the #FiestaBowl pic.twitter.com/gRcpmVI2Ih\n\n— 🜲 🜲 🜲 (@fsh733) January 9, 2026\n\nPenalties are rarely called on Hail Marys, as both receivers and defenders are often doing whatever they can to be at the top of the heap when the ball reaches the end zone. ESPN rules expert Bill LeMonnier believed the officials made the right decision with a no-call:\n\n“We have what we call mutual combat. Both players are getting their hands on each other. We’re going to leave that alone 99% of the time. I want to see one of them get a true, true advantage.”\n\nHad defensive pass interference been called, it would have been another, untimed play for Ole Miss at Miami's 20-yard line. That would have still been a tough get, but it was better than what reality offered.\n\nThe play ends a chaotic but ultimately successful season for the Rebels, who went 11-1 in the regular season, beat Tulane and Georgia in the first two rounds of the College Football Playoffs and lost head coach Lane Kiffin to LSU in the process. That standoff over Kiffin's exit threatened to overshadow the postseason for the program, but the players and new head coach Pete Golding still managed to play at a high level.\n\nThe loss is also a tough break for Kiffin. Had his old program won, it would have been another $250,000 for him in LSU's incredible bonus-matching agreement.",

    "description": "Vijay Singh's whopping career earnings come with a fun and, until this week, little-talked-about perk: a golden ticket back to the Tour.",
    "fullText": "Vijay Singh has made 648 career PGA Tour starts. That doesn't sniff the haul of Mark Brooks, who made a record 803 Tour appearances, but it's still a ton of golf.\n\nSingh's first Tour start came when Bush 41 was still in office, at the 1992 Memorial, where the then relative unknown 29-year-old Fijian played on a sponsor's exemption and tied for 7th. Over the next three-plus decades, Singh compiled a resume that elevated him to a place among the all-time greats: 34 wins, 28 runners-up, a staggering made-cut percentage of nearly 80% and - generational wealth alert! - more than $71 million in on-course earnings, which ranks 6th on the career winnings list behind only Tiger, Rory, Scottie and two gilded J's (Justin Rose and Jim Furyk).\n\nThat last accolade comes with a fun and, until this week, little-talked-about perk: a golden ticket back to the Tour. As decreed in the Tour's eligibility rules, players who have lost Tour status but are among the top 50 all-time earners may regain full membership for a season of their choice. The ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nThis year, Singh, who is 62, is cashing in.\n\nA soon-to-be 63-year-old golfer rejoining the world's most competitive tour is not as wild as, say, the hypothetical of Michael Jordan (who is 62) resigning with the Bulls or Roger Clemens (who is 63) returning to an MLB mound, but it's still a comeback at which to marvel, especially in an era in which the Tour has been getting leaner.\n\nBut the rules are the rules and beginning with the Sony Open in Honolulu next week, Singh will be back pacing Tour fairways for the first time (non-Masters division) since the 2021 Honda Classic, where he shot 74-73 and missed the cut. Singh's last made-cut on Tour came at the 2020 Memorial, where he tied for 62nd. The last time he played 10 or more events in a season was in 2017-18.\n\nSingh won't have carte blanche playing privileges; the designated events will, of course, be off limits. But a Tour spokesperson said that Singh \"will likely be eligible for the vast majority of full-field events\" in 2026. The spokesperson did not know how many of those tournaments Singh intends to enter.\n\nSingh has battled injuries in recent years, notably a balky back. In April, he withdrew from the Masters, citing an undisclosed injury, which snapped his run of 31 consecutive Masters starts. In 20 appearances on the PGA Tour Champions last year, he had 6 top 10s and finished 23rd on the money list.\n\nSingh is known for his tireless work ethic and marathon range sessions, and he still has pop; his 292.4-yard average driving distance in 2025 ranked 16th on the Champions circuit. But there's long and then there's PGA Tour long. That driving average would have ranked 164th on the PGA Tour in 2025, a couple of ticks above the likes of Lucas Glover and Russell Henley.\n\nSingh knows what he's up against. He said as much when he played in the 2019 Players Championship as a 57-year-old. \"Playing the regular Tour is a lot more pressure, I think, to play well,\" he said. \"There’s a lot more work required to go out there and be ready to play. I practice more when I play the regular Tour. The preparation is a little bit different.\n\n\"Playing the Champions tour, it’s a lot more relaxing for me. When I started playing there, I don’t want to come back here, like it’s so easy to play there, you get practice rounds in the cart and pro-am in the cart. Over here, it’s a full four days, plus two extra days of playing and walking.\"\n\nNews of Singh's return to the young-guys tour, where he'll be playing against opponents four decades his junior, has drawn the ire of at least some members of the golf Twitter peanut gallery, who have alleged that Singh, essentially on a lark, will be taking away precious playing spots from more deserving or needy players. Singh weathered similar criticism when he entered a Korn Ferry Tour event in 2020; so intense was the blowback that he withdrew.\n\nIn response to Singh's 2026 return, Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee said his beef is not so much with Singh as it with the exemption itself. \"This is what happens when you give into or give too much power to players,\" Chamblee wrote on X. \"If the PGA Tour is going to claim to be a sport based upon meritocracy, you can't allow players to monetize their performances of a decade or decades ago, through current exemptions. Sport must always answer the question: why are you here rather than someone else? And the answer can never be because I was great ten or twenty years ago.\"\n\nCould Singh still be great? Highly unlikely. Could he still make cuts? Certainly. He did so at the 2024 Masters, where he opened 75-73 before a third-round 82 derailed him. The oldest player to make a PGA Tour cut in an individual stroke-play event is Sam Snead, who, at 67, played the weekend at the 1979 Westchester Classic. Jack Nicklaus and Fred Funk both made PGA Tour cuts at 64, and Tom Watson did so at 65. On the right course, on the right week, it's not unthinkable that Singh could find himself within shouting distance of the lead.\n\nIf he's not, you'll probably find him on the range.\n\nThe post This 62-year-old is rejoining PGA Tour. Here's the rule that enabled it appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Miami is playing for its first national title in over two decades after taking down Ole Miss 31-27 in the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday night. Here are the five plays that stood out in the No. 10 Hurricanes' College Football Playoff semifinal win over the No. 6 Rebels.\n\nThe star Ole Miss running back put the Rebels up 7-3 on the first play of the second quarter with his long TD run.\n\nKEWAN LACY 73 YARDS TO THE 🏠 pic.twitter.com/h7jsXm77V9\n\nBut that TD came at a cost to Ole Miss. Lacy appeared to suffer a right hamstring injury as he approached the end zone. Replays showed that he appeared to be laboring as he slowed toward the goal line.\n\nLacy didn’t play another snap the rest of the quarter and Ole Miss coach Pete Golding said he’d be evaluated at halftime. Lacy returned to the game in the third quarter with a compression sleeve on his right leg. And he served as a decoy for much of the second half.\n\nOle Miss threw the ball 19 straight times before Lacy got his first carry of the second half. He finished with 11 carries for 103 yards and a TD.\n\nToney gave Miami a 24-19 lead with 5:04 to go when he caught a tunnel screen and raced 36 yards for a touchdown.\n\nTHE FRESHMAN 🔥\n\nMalachi Toney turned on the jets! pic.twitter.com/pCvyMAOknz\n\nThe freshman wide receiver was targeted 10 times and had five catches for 81 yards. Hardly any of those catches were downfield, either. Tony ended the game with 77 yards after the catch; no other Miami player had more than 30.\n\nToney emerged as one of the most dynamic playmakers in college football as a freshman in 2025 and has more than 1,000 receiving yards. He also made an incredible catch that didn’t count later in the game. Had Toney gotten his entire foot down in bounds on this grab, we’d run out of words trying to describe how good it was.\n\nIt took Ole Miss less than two minutes to respond to Toney’s TD. Wright scored on the sixth play of a 75-yard drive to give Ole Miss a one-point lead before Trinidad Chambliss’ two-point pass to Caleb Odom put Ole Miss up 27-24.\n\nChambliss in the clutch 😤 \n\nThe Rebels regain the lead 👀 \n\nWatch NOW on ESPN and the ESPN App pic.twitter.com/3WnYMhbCyg\n\nWright found himself wide open on a corner route after the safety was late to follow him to the pylon. It was the third catch of the game for Wright as he finished with 64 yards receiving.\n\nAfter Toney’s touchdown came on Miami’s fourth play of a 75-yard drive, the Hurricanes needed a lot more plays to regain the lead. Carson Beck’s 3-yard TD with 18 seconds to go gave Miami a 31-27 lead.\n\nMIAMI WITH A SPOT IN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP ON THE LINE! 🔥 \n\nCanes takes the lead with 18 seconds left 😳 pic.twitter.com/PI9RRBqGau\n\nBeck’s run was the 15th play of a drive that took nearly three minutes for the Hurricanes.\n\nBeck attempted 12 passes on that drive as the Hurricanes also benefitted from a facemask penalty on Ole Mis defensive back Jaylon Braxton. He was called for a facemask as Beck threw toward Keelan Marion on the sideline with just under two minutes to go.\n\nThe TD was Beck’s first rushing TD since he scored in a Week 3 win over USF. The Georgia transfer finished the game 23-of-37 passing for 268 yards and two touchdowns and an interception while he rushed for minus-6 yards when sacks were taken into account.\n\nOle Miss’ chances of a comeback were farfetched after Beck’s score. The Rebels had just one timeout remaining but were at midfield with 13 seconds to go.\n\nThe Rebels then got to the Miami 35-yard line with six seconds to go before Chambliss heaved a Hail Mary toward the end zone as time expired.\n\nLast play of the #FiestaBowl pic.twitter.com/gRcpmVI2Ih\n\n— 🜲 🜲 🜲 (@fsh733) January 9, 2026\n\nOle Miss fans understandably wanted pass interference on the Hail Mary. But it’s important to note that pass interference is hardly called on those attempts. And a penalty would not have guaranteed Ole Miss a legit chance at the win.\n\nIf officials threw a flag on the play, the Rebels would simply have had an untimed down from the 20-yard line. Sure, it’s easier to score from the 20 than it is the 35-yard line, but it’s still a low-percentage play. Miami would have likely won the game even with a penalty. But did the penalty prevent De’Zhaun Stribling from catching the pass? He was able to tip the ball as it fell incomplete.",

    "fullText": "The Fiesta Bowl matchup between No. 6 Mississippi and No. 10 Miami turned into an instant classic, with the Hurricanes coming from behind to win 31-27 and advance to the College Football Playoff championship game.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be a true CFP game without at least a little controversy — and the Hurricanes and Rebels delivered on the game's final play.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Miami beats Ole Miss with last-minute TD in Fiesta Bowl, will play for national title\n\nAfter giving up a 3-yard go-ahead touchdown to Carson Beck with 18 seconds left, Ole Miss advanced to the Miami 35-yard line as Trinidad Chambliss completed passes of 23 and 17 yards, respectively, to set up one final shot at the end zone. Ultimately, his pass to De'Zhaun Stribling fell incomplete, with Miami defensive back Ethan O'Connor in defense.\n\nHowever, Chambliss and the Ole Miss sideline were quick to call for a flag in the immediate aftermath of the incompletion, believing O'Connor had committed pass interference, which — had officials thrown a flag — would have set up another shot at the end zone, this time from the 20-yard line. Officials swallowed their whistles, ending the game.\n\nTHE MIAMI HURRICANES ARE HEADED TO THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP #PMSCFP pic.twitter.com/Id1MW1qfyU\n\n— Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) January 9, 2026\n\nHere's another vantage of the play, which shows O'Connor grabbing onto Stribling's jersey as they both ran to the back of the end zone.

    "fullText": "Betting on himself pays off in a heartbeat. And Carson Beck’s decision to stay in college football for one more season turns golden as Miami heads to the CFP finals with a 31–27 win over Ole Miss. This is their first championship berth since 2001, and all thanks to Beck’s last-minute game-changing TDs that turned things around. Now, Beck sums up the moment like a hero.\n\n“We never flinched,” Miami quarterback Carson Beck said after the game. “We, I mean, in the face of adversity, when we had to respond, we responded. You could just see it in their eye. You could see it in their eye. We all had a good feeling that what just happened was about to happen.\n\n“I actually went in drive, and you were trying to loosen them up by some right before you drove it down for the win. I told them, we got three minutes for the rest of our lives, bro. No shit else matters, alright? I don’t mean to cuss. Emotions are rolling, but nothing else matters. We got three minutes to go do this, man.”\n\nCarson Beck scrambled for a three-yard rushing touchdown with 18 seconds left, sending Miami past Ole Miss. Something that he later calls “the best feeling I ever had in my life.” The game swung wildly in the fourth quarter as Ole Miss brightly took control of the game.\n\nQuarterback Trinidad Chambliss connected with Wright on a 24-yard touchdown pass to put the Rebels ahead 27-24 with 3:13 minutes remaining. Despite that, Beck steadies the Hurricanes, calmly leading the game-changing drive.\n\nThe post Carson Beck Reveals Last 3 Minute Moment Before Historic Miami Touchdown appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "After a slow first period, the Carolina Hurricanes sharpened up their game and went on the defeat the Anaheim Ducks, 5-2 on Thursday night at the Lenovo Center.\n\nIt was the third straight win for Carolina while the Ducks have now lost eight in a row.\n\nThe home team got off to a bit of a slow start and fell behind 1-0 in the first but they turned things around in the second.\n\nThey outshot the Ducks 19-3 in that period and put three goals up on the board.\n\nFirst, Mark Jankowski got things started when he took the puck to the net.\n\nShortly after, Granlund scored from in close but that would be it for Anaheim.\n\nTwo minutes after that score, Taylor Hall made a perfect feed to an open Logan Stankoven to tie things up again. That made three goals in the last three games for Stankoven.\n\nJalen Chatfield blasted in a shot to give the Canes a 3-2 lead going into the second intermission. It was Chatfield’s 300th NHL game.\n\nThe Canes continued to shut down the opposition in the third as the Ducks could only manage another four shots in that period.\n\nCarolina goaltender, Fred Andersen did what he needed to do and stopped the shots he saw to earn his first win since early November. The win put an end to a nine game losing streak for Andersen.\n\nMidway through the third, Jackson Blake made a pretty backhander off an Alexander Nikishin shot to put the home team up by two.\n\nTaylor Hall notched an empty-netter to close out the scoring.\n\nIn all, the Canes outshot the Ducks, 35-13.\n\nCarolina dominated the faceoff circle winning 64%.\n\nThe Hurricanes will take Friday off and will prepare to take on the Seattle Kraken on Saturday night.\n\nGame Summary – https://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20252026/GS020688.HTM\n\nEvent Summary – https://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20252026/ES020688.HTM\n\nInterviews – https://canespr.com/2026/01/06/january-6-postgame-notes-stats-video-audio/",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLane Kiffin may no longer be on the Ole Miss Rebels' sideline, but as the team continues its College Football Playoff run, he remains a central talking point.\n\nThe coach's controversial move to join the LSU Tigers at the end of Ole Miss' regular season, just before his team was about to begin preparations for the CFP, was the biggest story of the 2025 coaching cycle in college football. And despite Kiffin no longer coaching the Rebels, he is able to continue financially benefiting from his old team's playoff victories.\n\nLanguage in Kiffin's LSU contract allows him to still receive the bonuses for playoff success he would have received from Ole Miss had he stayed at the school.\n\nHere's what to know about how much Lane Kiffin makes from Ole Miss' CFP wins.\n\nMORE: Which Ole Miss assistants followed Lane Kiffin to LSU?\n\nThe Advocate reported that Kiffin agreed to a seven-year deal, $91 million deal in Baton Rouge, which also has opportunities to earn more via incentives. Additionally, language in Kiffin's contract reportedly requires a raise from LSU to make him the highest-paid coach in the country if he wins a national championship.\n\nIn the deal, LSU committed to paying any bonuses Kiffin would have received during Ole Miss' playoff run, per ESPN.\n\nKiffin is reportedly set to make $13 million annually, making him one of the highest-paid coaches in college football. Georgia's Kirby Smart is the only coach who makes more annually, based on reported figures.\n\nKiffin's Ole Miss salary in 2025 was exactly $9 million, per USA Today, which made him the 11th highest-paid head coach in college football. Kiffin signed a six-year extension worth $54 million in 2023 with Ole Miss.\n\nMORE: The highest paid coaches in college football\n\nLSU included language in Kiffin's new contract that allows him to financially benefit from when his former team, Ole Miss, wins playoff games. When Ole Miss beat Tulane in the first round of the CFP, Kiffin received $250,000, per Front Office Sports. And he received $500,000 after Ole Miss upset Georgia to reach the semifinals.\n\nDepending on how far Ole Miss advances, Kiffin could receive plenty more from the Tigers.\n\nHere is the structure of how much Kiffin receives for Ole Miss CFP wins, per Front Office Sports:\n\n$150,000 for advancing to the first round of the CFP\n\n$250,000 for appearing in the quarterfinals\n\n$500,000 if Ole Miss advances to the semifinals\n\n$750,000 if Ole Miss advances to the national championship\n\n$1 million if Ole Miss wins the title\n\nMORE: When does LSU play Ole Miss in 2026?",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich vice-captain Joshua Kimmich is expected to miss his side's clash with Wolfsburg on Sunday due to injury, as the Bundesliga resumes amid icy conditions across Germany.\n\nVincent Kompany's side will be hoping to strengthen their nine-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga when they return from the winter break at home to Wolfsburg this weekend.\n\nYet they will be without star midfielder Kimmich, who is still recovering from a recurring ankle issue that has plagued him since November.\n\n\"We don’t want to take any risks, he should make a complete recovery,\" Bayern sporting director Max Eberl told German media this week.\n\n\"I can’t say exactly when he will be fit: it won't be a very long time, but it could be a few days.

    "title": "Eagles-49ers Game Preview: 5 questions and answers with the Wild Card enemy",
    "description": "Opponent insight on Philadelphia’s upcoming playoff matchup.",
    "fullText": "Have you heard? The Philadelphia Eagles are hosting the San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday.\n\nIn order to preview this Wild Card matchup, I reached out to our enemies over at Niners Nation. The nice Nicholas McGee kindly took the time took the time to answer my questions about this upcoming playoff battle. Let’s take a look at the answers.\n\nI think most 49ers fans would probably accept that this is likely going to be a step too far. The team will undoubtedly fight, and they deserve immense credit for what they’ve achieved this season with the injury adversity they’ve faced. However, with the injuries they have on defense — particularly at linebacker — and the doubt surrounding Trent Williams and Ricky Pearsall, it’s difficult to see the 49ers having enough in the tank to pull off the upset. A wild card defeat would be disappointing but, given all that’s transpired in a year of transition, the season as a whole should be seen as a step forward by a young roster.\n\nWe have to be honest, there isn’t much in the 49ers’ favor in this game. If Williams is healthy, then it can be argued that the 49ers have an edge with their tackles going against the Eagles’ defensive front in the run game. Williams and Colton McKivitz were two of the best run-blocking tackles in football in the regular season, and the Eagles have shown some vulnerability to the rush, ranking 17th in run stop win rate and 19th in success rate allowed against the run. Despite the strong play of Williams and McKivitz, the 49er run game hasn’t fired on all cylinders this season. Yet if they can win the battle on the line of scrimmage and open holes for Christian McCaffrey, then San Francisco’s slim chances of upsetting the odds will improve.\n\nThere’s a lot to choose from, but I think I’d probably settle on the Eagles’ pass-catchers against the 49ers’ back seven. That’s not an answer tied to the cornerback play, but rather the injuries at linebacker and the struggles at safety, a position where the Niners have continued to get extremely volatile play despite investing pretty heavily in that spot in the draft in recent years. If Dallas Goedert is healthy and the 49ers aren’t able to get pressure, then it could be a really productive day for Jalen Hurts attacking the flimsy spine of the 49er defense.\n\nI think they would do it again, considering the relatively small opportunity cost. He was impressive as a rotational pass rusher, which was the role the 49ers envisioned for him, when Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams were healthy. As the injuries have piled up on the defensive line, he’s had to take on more of a burden in playing increased snaps and the impact of his rushes has waned. Still, when the 49ers have successfully disrupted the quarterback, it has typically been Huff doing the damage. Even in an awful season for the 49er pass rush, Huff has consistently created pressure. Whether he makes any tangible impact on this game will likely depend on whether his running mates up front can do the same and give the 49ers an at least mildly effective team rush.\n\nI think the 49ers can do enough to keep this game relatively close, but with their susceptibility to both the run and the pass, I expect the defense to ultimately prove their undoing. The 49ers ideally want to turn this game into a shootout but, potentially going against a Vic Fangio defense without Williams and Pearsall, they don’t really have the offensive resources to do that. I expect an admirable effort on the road, but a one-score defeat feels about right.\n\nPrediction: Eagles 28, 49ers 20.",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans added another name to the list of head coaching candidates, requesting an interview with former Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury.",
    "fullText": "Earlier in the week, the Washington Commanders and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury agreed to mutually part ways, and it did not take long for him to end up in the head coaching cycle. On Thursday, Kingsbury became the 13th potential candidate linked to the Tennessee Titans' coaching search, with Tennessee joining the Baltimore Ravens in requesting an interview.\n\nKingsbury is an intriguing, offensive-minded candidate who would bring a system that fits with Cam Ward’s skill set. Known for his work with Patrick Mahomes in college, he took over the Arizona Cardinals in 2019 and led them to a 28-37-1 record before being fired at the conclusion of the 2022 season.\n\nWhile in Arizona, his team improved over the first three seasons at the helm, eventually making the playoffs in 2021. However, injuries derailed the team in 2022, and the team regressed, leading to his firing at the end of the season.\n\nThat was fast: Sources say former #Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury will interview for the #Ravens and #Titans open HC positions. pic.twitter.com/75d7cZhwXq\n\n— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) January 8, 2026\n\nAfter one season as an offensive analyst at USC, he returned to the NFL in 2024 with the Commanders as offensive coordinator, helping propel rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels to a record-setting season. However, he was unable to replicate those results in 2025, mostly due to injuries.\n\nWith a lack of established offensive-minded candidates, it is likely that Kingsbury’s stock will continue to rise during this cycle, especially with teams that feature athletic quarterbacks after his early success with Kyler Murray and Daniels.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Tennessee Titans: Kliff Kingsbury to interview for head coach",

    "fullText": "Miami Madness: How Hurricanes won CFP semifinal thriller against Ole Miss originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIs the College Football Playoff now the College Football Tournament?\n\nThat's how this feels now. The CFP is the CFT – and that is how the ACC is back in the championship game. \"January Madness\" doesn't have the same ring to it.\n\nWhat about \"Miami Madness\"? It's here.\n\nHow else can you explain how the Hurricanes will play for the College Football Playoff championship on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.? No. 10 Miami created that with a thrilling 31-27 victory against No. 6 Ole Miss in the College Football Playoff semifinal at Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Thursday.\n\nQuarterback Carson Beck – a sixth-year senior transfer from Georgia – high-stepped into the end zone with a 3-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds remaining. That was the score in a back-and-forth with Ole Miss star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss in a 25-point fourth quarter that resembled the final minutes of a March Madness thriller.\n\nIt wasn't over until Chambliss' desperation pass into the end zone between Ethan O'Connor and Zechariah Poyser fell incomplete. There was no late flag this time.\n\nMiami (13-2) beat Ole Miss (13-2), and now faces the winner of the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl between No. 1 Indiana (14-0) and No. 5 Oregon (13-1).\n\nIs this how the 12-team College Football Playoff is going to work? Do you love it?\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nOle Miss kicker Lucas Carneiro took center stage in CFP\n\nWhat is next for Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss?\n\nThe Hurricanes had +2700 odds to win the national championship coming into the CFP as the “bubble team.” Miami was on the outside looking in through most of November, but they leap-frogged No. 11 Notre Dame in the final set of rankings as the last at-large team in the field.\n\nThe Hurricanes watched five-loss Duke win the ACC championship game against Virginia, but the Hurricanes were the team the conference campaigned for to get into the field. By no coincidence, ACC commissioner Jim Phillips could be seen on the sideline Thursday wearing an orange-and-white tie. This is a huge win for the conference made better by knocking the SEC out of the field.\n\nMORE: SEC lags behind in bowl standings\n\nThe Hurricanes have pulled off upsets against Texas A&M and Ohio State, then won the thriller against Ole Miss to keep the momentum going. They will be underdogs again against the Hoosiers or Ducks. So it could be argued that Miami – the program with five national championships – is your realistic College Football Playoff version of a Cinderella.\n\nMiami led 17-13 at halftime – but it felt like the Hurricanes should have led by more. The Hurricanes out-gained the Rebels 228-145, ran 19 more offensive plays and controlled time of possession at 22 minutes and 14 seconds compared to Ole Miss at seven minutes and 16 seconds.\n\nThe Hurricanes made those little plays that made a difference. Miami faced a third-and-8 in the second quarter. Beck fired a short pass to receiver Malachi Toney, who stepped out of the tackle by Suntarine Perkins and picked up the first down.\n\nThe Hurricanes turned that into a 4-yard TD run by CharMar Brown with 7:23 left in the half. Beck hit a wide-open Keelan Marion for a 52-yard TD on the next drive. Ole Miss countered that with a pair of field goals from Lucas Carneiro from 42 and 58 yards, respectively, for the 17-13 halftime score.\n\nThe Hurricanes tried to give it back in the second half. Miami defensive players dropped four interceptions in the game and had a series of head-scratching penalties. Ole Miss had a 24-19 lead before Toney took a screen pass from Beck for a 36-yard TD with 5:04 remaining for a  24-19 lead.\n\nOle Miss got the ball back with 5:04 remaining, and Chambliss continued his heater that led the Rebels to a 39-34 victory in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. Chambliss threw a 24-yard TD pass to Dae'Quan Wright with 3:13 remaining for a 27-24 lead. Miami answered with a 15-play, 75-yard drive led by Beck, who finished 23 of 37 for 268 yards, two TDs and one interception.\n\nChambliss – who finished 23 of 37 for 277 yards and a TD – nearly led the Rebels to the CFP championship game. This was the team whose coach Lane Kiffin took the LSU job at the end of the regular season. Yet an instant classic that had four lead changes ended with Miami going home for the national championship.\n\nThis would only add to the \"Madness.\" Consider that since 2014, only one men's basketball team that held the No. 1 overall seed going into the NCAA Tournament has won the national championship. That was No. 1 UConn, which won back-to-back national titles. The previous season, the Huskies beat No. 5 Miami in the Final Four.\n\nWere those Hurricanes under Jim Larranaga any more of a long-shot than the ones on the football field that have burned through No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 2 Ohio State – the defending national champion – before beating the Rebels on Thursday?\n\nMiami's defense has injuries. A defense that had 12 sacks in the first two rounds with Rueben Bain Jr. had just one sack against the Rebels. Yet Miami coach Mario Cristobal has found a way to push this team into the championship game with a patient running game – Miami had 51 rushing attempts while Ole Miss had 21 with Mark Fletcher Jr. totaling 22 carries for 133 yards – and Beck is now 37-5 as a starter.\n\nThey'll be in their backyard too, the unintended home-field advantage that will come with a list of Miami icons watching from the sidelines. Did anybody think this was possible when the Hurricanes played their final home game in the regular season against NC State on Nov. 15 before five straight wins away from home?\n\nThere is only one word for that.",

    "description": "Miami is flying home on Friday from the Fiesta Bowl.  It'll be the last flight for the Hurricanes this season.  For the fifth time, Miami will be playing for a national championship on its home field.",
    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Miami is flying home on Friday from the Fiesta Bowl. It'll be the last flight for the Hurricanes this season.\n\nThey'll get to the next game — the last game — by bus.\n\nFor the fifth time, Miami will be playing for a national championship on its home field. The first four of those games were at the now-demolished Orange Bowl; this one against either Oregon or Indiana in the College Football Playoff title game on Jan. 19 will be at Hard Rock Stadium, the Miami Dolphins' home field, where the Hurricanes have played their home games since 2008.\n\n“We’re back in Hard Rock,” quarterback Carson Beck said after he produced the go-ahead touchdown — with his legs, not his arm — in Miami's 31-27 win over Mississippi in the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday night. “So, I think that’s all that needs to be said.”\n\nMiami is 3-1 in its other national-title-game appearances at home — though it should be noted that in the Bowl Championship Series and now CFP era when there has been a designated “national championship game,” the Hurricanes have not gotten this far.\n\n“This team knows they are the team and the time is now,” coach Mario Cristobal said during the on-field celebration Thursday night.\n\nOther teams have won national championships close to home over the years. For example, Southern California claims national titles in the 1931 and 1932 seasons after winning Rose Bowls (it wasn't USC's home field, but not exactly a long road trip for the Trojans, either). Those came before The Associated Press began awarding a national championship trophy with the 1936 season.\n\nIn recent years, LSU won a BCS title (but not the AP title) for the 2003 season by winning the Sugar Bowl in nearby New Orleans — about 80 miles from Baton Rouge. LSU secured national championships for the 2007 and 2019 seasons by winning in New Orleans as well.\n\nBeing at home — or near home — hasn't guaranteed titles, though. Texas beat USC in the Rose Bowl to win the 2005 season's national championship. Alabama faced what might have been considered road games in the 2011 and 2017 seasons and won both, topping LSU in New Orleans and Georgia in Atlanta for national crowns.\n\nAnd Miami's most recent home title game was a loss as well, when the Hurricanes fell to Oklahoma 24-17 to end the 1994 season.\n\nHere's look at Miami's previous home title-game appearances.\n\n1983 season: Miami 31, Nebraska 30\n\nThe Hurricanes ran out to a 17-0 lead over the top-ranked, unbeaten and heavily favored Cornhuskers, who clawed within 31-30 with 48 seconds left. Nebraska coach Tom Osborne decided to try a 2-point conversion instead of playing for the tie; the pass fell incomplete and Miami finished atop the AP poll. “We're No. 1,” Hurricanes coach Howard Schnellenberger said. “No doubt about it.” He was right, and Miami had its first national title.\n\n1987 season: Miami 20, Oklahoma 14\n\nOklahoma came in undefeated and ranked No. 1, Miami came in undefeated and ranked No. 2. The teams were tied 7-7 at halftime, but the Hurricanes scored 10 points in the fourth quarter and held on to win their second national championship.\n\n1991 season: Miami 22, Nebraska 0\n\nMiami's fourth national title, and third won at the Orange Bowl, was no contest. The Hurricanes led 13-0 after just 11 minutes of play and the defense never let Nebraska — a double-digit underdog — get on track.\n\n1994 season: Nebraska 24, Miami 17\n\nIn the final year of the short-lived Bowl Coalition era, the Hurricanes ran out to a 10-0 lead after the first quarter. But the Cornhuskers wouldn't go away, and Cory Schlesinger ran for two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to cap the comeback and lead Nebraska to the win.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Stone had three points and added to his career-best goal streak that is one behind the Golden Knights record set by Max Pacioretty in 2021.\n\nJack Eichel had a goal and an assist for Vegas, Brett Howden also scored and Mitch Marner and Tomas Hertl each had two assists.

    "fullText": "'Mutual combat' on final play of Miami vs. Ole Miss: Explaining pass interference no-call at end of CFP semifinal originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a back-and-forth fourth quarter in Thursday’s Fiesta Bowl, it was only fitting that it came down to one final play between Miami and Ole Miss.\n\nThe two teams exchanged leads throughout the final frame, but Carson Beck’s rushing touchdown with 18 seconds remaining proved to be the difference in the Hurricanes’ 31-27 win, sending them to the College Football Playoff championship game. Still, there was some controversy at the end.\n\nOn Trinidad Chambliss’ final Hail Mary attempt, which fell incomplete, officials ruled there was no pass interference by a Miami defender after he appeared to grab Rebels wide receiver De’Zhaun Stribling’s jersey.\n\nHere’s how officials ruled the play “mutual combat” between the defensive back and receiver, officially deciding the Fiesta Bowl and sending Miami to the national championship.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Carson Beck's game-winning drive vs. Ole Miss\n\nTrailing by four with just seconds remaining, Ole Miss had no other option than a Hail Mary attempt to close out the CFP semifinals. Chambliss fired a deep pass into the left corner of the end zone, almost right on target for his receiver, but it was broken up and fell incomplete.\n\nIn real time, it appeared there wasn't any case for pass interference. A few Miami defenders were in the area, and the ball wound up being just out of the reach of Stribling's arms.\n\nTHE LAST PLAY THAT SENT MIAMI TO THE CFP NATTY 🏆 pic.twitter.com/xHXFD1iR2B\n\nLooking at further angles revealed at least a case for defensive pass interference, however. Defensive back Ethan O'Connor was visibly tugging on Stribling's jersey prior the ball arriving, then when Stribling went to make a dive toward the ball, he was smothered by Hurricanes defenders as the ball fell incomplete.\n\nJust the defender doing his job.... No flag on the final play of the game pic.twitter.com/0SfjgZSNR9\n\n— Rate the Refs (@Rate_the_Refs) January 9, 2026\n\nESPN's rules expert referred to the play as \"mutual combat,\" with both players, O'Connor and Stribling, playing a role in the physicality.\n\nPlenty of fans online, however, saw the play as O'Connor interfering for a few yards before the players entangled closer to the ball\n\nWait… did Miami get away with blatant pass interference?\n\nOle Miss robbed?pic.twitter.com/h5aZSqMzvC\n\n— Ratioed Sports (@RatioedSports) January 9, 2026\n\nEven former Rebels coach Lane Kiffin chimed in, calling it pass interference.\n\nPass interference 💯!!! https://t.co/99jrGosJ5w\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) January 9, 2026\n\nAfter the game, Ole Miss head coach Pete Golding was asked about the potential pass interference.\n\n\"Those situations are tough to call. Yeah, there was contact. It happens a lot,\" Golding said, per The Rebel Walk. \"That's not why we lost the game. I think it shows you the resilience of this team.\"\n\nMORE: What's next for Trinidad Chambliss after loss to Miami?\n\n\"Mutual combat\" in football is typically a term used to describe a receiver and defensive back being \"mutually\" as physical with one another on a play, meaning no penalty would be called despite that physicality.\n\nWith the receiver and defensive back competing for the ball, officials sometimes leave potential pass interference as a no-call because of how entangled both players are in the interaction. If one player is blatantly interfering, that changes things, but \"mutual combat\" is more about reciprocal hand-fighting reflected on both players.\n\nMORE: What's next for Trinidad Chambliss after Ole Miss' season ending?\n\nIn college football, defensive pass interference is flagged when a defensive player significantly prevents an eligible receiver's chance to catch a pass beyond the neutral zone. It typically is called for contact like grabbing, pushing or tripping the receiver before the ball arrives.\n\nPass interference only applies to forward passes that travel beyond the neutral zone in college football.\n\nMORE:Breaking down Trinidad Chambliss' NFL Draft projection\n\nThursday's pass interference debate was a bit reminiscent of another Fiesta Bowl. In 2003, with Miami taking on Ohio State in the BCS national championship, Terry Porter threw one of the most controversial flags ever, just when the Hurricanes had appeared to take a 24-17 win in overtime and win the national title.\n\nPorter called pass interference on Miami's Glenn Sharp, and because of it, Ohio State stayed alive in the game and received a first down. The Buckeyes then proceeded to tie the game, then win it in a second overtime.\n\nPart of the controversy was how long it took Porter to throw the flag, as a few seconds had passed after the play and Miami appearing to win. The Hurricanes had begun celebrating by the time the flag came out.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s academy talents were ignored and criticised by Ruben Amorim, often unjustly.\n\nThe former head coach criticised Chido Obi, Harry Amass, and Toby Collyer, while refusing to hand Kobbie Mainoo a start in the Premier League despite the obvious midfield deficiencies.\n\nPlenty of Carrington’s finest have been waiting in the wings to make their first team debut, and only towards the end of Amorim’s regime did Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey come on for their debuts.\n\nThere are quite a few others, like Sekou Kone, who were close to a breakthrough last season, but the Portuguese tactician did not trust him enough in the end.\n\nHe impressed on the post-season tour of Asia, and was part of the pre-season squad but did not make it off the bench.\n\nThat clearly showed chances would be limited and there were talks of a loan move in the summer but it did not materialise. A horror injury further restricted his minutes for the U21s.\n\nAnd now, the Malian, who is fully fit, has been linked with a temporary switch to INEOS-owned club FC Lausanne Sport in the winter window.\n\nAs revealed by Blick, the 19-year-old is already training with the Swiss side, and is also expected to play in one of their friendlies against either Xamax or Nyon.\n\nThe Swiss Super League side already have Enzo Kana-Biyik on loan from the Red Devils, and a final decision on whether Sekou Kone will join them is expected before the window closes.\n\nManager Peter Zeidler revealed, “Yes, he’s (Sekou Kone) been with us for a few days, we know he’s a good player and we’ve been watching him closely. He’ll play with us on Thursday against Xamax or Nyon.\n\nOn whether it is a trial, the German replied, “I don’t really like that term; it doesn’t reflect reality.\n\n“He’s with us, we can observe him closely, and we’ll make a decision, just like we did last summer with Enzo Kana-Biyik, a very good young player who improved a lot in just a few months with us despite his early-season injury, and who also belongs to Manchester United.\n\n“We saw his quality, particularly with his assist against Fiorentina. We have good experience with Enzo, so why not with Sekou Koné? But to say today whether he’ll come, I don’t know. It depends on several factors; we’ll decide between January 15th and February 15th, as with all players.”\n\nIt will be interesting to see if INEOS actually loan him out, especially if the new caretaker boss decided to rely on youth once he comes in.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "On This Day (9 Jan 1993): Winger Nets First Sunderland Goal – Two Years After Signing!",
    "description": "We take a look back at Brian Mooney’s Sunderland career – including his best game for the club, 33 years to the day.",
    "fullText": "Brian Mooney arrived at Roker Park in February 1991, billed as the attacker who could spark Sunderland’s attack and help the club stave off the potential threat of relegation. The 25-year-old right winger had come through the ranks at Liverpool earning rave reviews at youth team level and playing for the first team in a league cup tie at Fulham for Liverpool, however breaking into what was possibly the best club side in the world in at the time would have been a challenge for anyone.\n\nKeen for first-team football, Mooney had a loan spell at Wrexham before joining Preston North End. He excelled at Deepdale, making a name for himself as one of the most exciting players outside of the top flight. Ron Atkinson had taken him to Sheffield Wednesday on a three-month loan with the intention of signing him, but injuries curtailed his time at Hillsborough. After Mooney had returned to Preston and proved his fitness, Denis Smith pounced, hoping the Irish winger – who’d been called up to the national squad prior to Italia 90 – would be the key to unlocking First Division defences.\n\nSmith had tried to sign Mooney three years earlier after a couple of impressive performances against Sunderland, but had been put off by the £750,000 fee that had been quoted by Preston’s then manager, John McGrath. A more palatable £225,000 had been agreed with current Deepdale boss Les Chapman, and Mooney had watched his new team mates go down 2-0 at Goodison Park, which left Sunderland in 17th place, two positions away from the relegation zone. After completing the signing, Smith said:\n\nHe has tremendous skills – the lad can play. He generally plays wide on the right, but he can also play up front, so that should put a bit of pressure on the front two. Lots of clubs have fancied him, but I’ve put my money where my mouth is. There are quite a few things that Mooney can do – he now has to show he can turn it on consistently at a higher level.\n\nHowever, sadly for Smith, Mooney didn’t prove to be the ingredient Sunderland were lacking in 1990-91 (Ally McCoist, who was out of favour at Rangers and strongly linked with a move at the same time as Mooney, would surely have been a far better signing in the circumstances), and primarily due to a foot injury picked up in a win over relegation rivals Luton, he managed just five top flight starts as the club suffered relegation on the last day at Maine Road.\n\nFast forward two years from Mooney’s arrival, and Smith was long gone. After five games in his first season, Mooney had made only six starts in Division Two during the 1991-92 campaign – a perennial struggle with that injury picked up on Kenilworth Road’s plastic pitch meant he was rarely in contention for a game; his league appearances that campaign were at the tail end, with caretaker manager Malcolm Crosby desperately trying to manage a heavy fixture list ahead of an FA Cup Final appearance against Liverpool.\n\nThe following season was a struggle once more for Mooney, and the club as a whole. Crosby’s spell in charge wasn’t yielding the results he needed, and with Sunderland in the lower reaches of the division and struggling for form, a fit-again Mooney earned a recall prior to Christmas – and put together a good run of performances.\n\nAhead of a game that took place against Cambridge United on this day in 1993, Crosby’s assistant manager Bobby Ferguson was excited about what Mooney was – finally – bringing to the table.\n\nIt’s like having a new signing. I saw him in the reserves’ first game of the season and he seemed to have everything. Before the game at Luton, I said to him, ‘Anybody can get into the first team – the hard part is staying there. He’s told me that’s what he wants to do, so now he’s got to go out there, be positive, and make the most of what he’s got.\n\nSunderland, with Mooney playing an increasingly important role, had ended the year with just one defeat in six, and were looking up rather than down. Cambridge, who were managed by former Sunderland skipper Ian Atkins, were viewed as relegation candidates – but despite former manager John Beck’s departure, they still had a reputation for being a tough, aggressive, long-ball team. This was a game Sunderland, with Mooney hitting his straps, were expecting to win to kickstart a run to the playoffs.\n\nThe lads lined up in an unchanged 4-4-2, with a defence of John Kay, Kevin Ball, Terry Butcher and Richard Ord playing in front of Tony Norman. Mooney lined up on the right wing, with youngster Micky Gray on the left, amd Gordon Armstrong and Shaun Cunnington playing in the centre. Up front, David Rush partnered Don Goodman.\n\nFor the visitors, meanwhile, notable names in their line-up were former Sunderland centre back Micky Heathcote, and striker Steve Claridge.\n\nBut, it was Mooney, building on some excellent performances, who stole the show – setting up two and scoring one in an eventful 3-3 draw.\n\nOn his day, Mooney was the stereotypical tricky winger. He was a bit scruffy, had slouched shoulders, wasn’t particularly pacey but could turn defenders inside out – and this was his best day in a Sunderland shirt.\n\nAfter a couple of chances at either end, Mooney took this game by the scruff of the neck. He cleverly set up a shooting opportunity for big-money signing Cunnington, whose effort was deflected behind for a corner. From that corner, Cunnington’s header was cleared off the line for another corner. Armstrong took it, and Mooney’s fierce shot was deflected in to make it 1-0.\n\nThe lead lasted only a few moments. This Sunderland team weren’t the most defensively resolute, and Clayton equalised with a low drive into the bottom corner.\n\nMooney had another effort as the lads looked to regain the lead, but after carrying the ball forward dangerously his shot from distance failed to trouble keeper Vaughan. Seven minutes before the break, however, Sunderland went in front – David Rush was the scorer, Mooney the architect. The Irishman cut inside before sending over a perfect cross for the young striker to head home.\n\nSunderland should have extended the lead before half time, Cunnington and Goodman coming close, and Rush failing to pick out an unmarked Goodman as the home team tried to seize the advantage. Mooney was causing ’endless problems’ for the Cambridge defence, and after cleverly twisting and turning he created a yard and hit a left foot drive narrowly over the bar.\n\nThe second half continued as the first half had finished, and Heathcote playing excellently against his former teammates, heading away countless crosses and deadballs – including one from Armstrong after the ever threatening Mooney was brought down after a surging run.\n\nHowever, just after the hour, Cambridge equalised through Claridge from close range; Cunnington, and Goodman both came close to restoring the lead in the moments after the equaliser, as the game swung from end to end. And on 76 the lads took the lead once more – albeit in controversial circumstances. Mooney’s cross found Brian Atkinson, whose fierce shot hit the underside of the bar. The linesman flagged a goal, much to the fury of Cambridge, who were never opposed to berating the officials. The goal stood, but in the closing stages, Cambridge were back level, with Raynor shooting into the top corner.\n\nMooney had one goal and two assists to his name, and he almost won the game for the lads in the final exchanges – putting the ball wide from a tight angle after Rush had charged down the goalkeeper’s clearance. At the other end, meanwhile, future Millwall and Birmingham manager Gary Rowett could have claimed all three points for the U’s, but for a brilliant save from Norman. 3-3, and come the end of the season, both teams would be involved in a last-day scrap to avoid the final relegation place.\n\nThat was the highlight of Mooney’s Sunderland career. While he kept his place for a few more weeks, Crosby was sacked and Terry Butcher didn’t fancy him too much. He had a brief loan spell at Burnley – a move he was deeply opposed to given his Preston roots but Sunderland insisted upon it. Disillusioned, and aged just 27, he went back to Ireland and played out his career there.\n\nIn a 2020 interview looking back on his career, Mooney said his struggles at Sunderland were down to poor medical treatment – something that other players of the late 80s and early 90s have been critical of too.\n\nI was playing in the first team and I broke my foot down at Luton. It was misdiagnosed. It was just a metatarsal issue, I should only have been out for eight or nine weeks and I missed a whole season over it, because they kept forcing me back a little bit early. It kept breaking. It broke four times before they X-rayed it again and acknowledged it was broken. They were trying to push me back three or four weeks after resting it and it kept breaking in the same spot.\n\nSo I just got a bit disillusioned with the whole thing then. I felt I was being treated pretty poorly. I was saying it was broken, they were saying it wasn’t. At the end of the day, it ended up being broken. I missed just over a season, so I got fed up. I was 27 at that stage and I was just thinking: ‘I don’t really want to stay over here.’\n\nIt was the orthopaedic surgeon who said that it wasn’t broken. He had acknowledged there was a break initially and then right at the end of the season, Sunderland got relegated into the old Second Division. I came back pre-season and it broke again on hard ground. They X-rayed it at that time and they said it wasn’t broken. But I’d broke it in the same place and then it broke another three or four times after that. I missed the whole season, it was very frustrating, especially when I found out it was broken all along, so I got a bit disillusioned with it. I started making plans to come home then.”",

    "fullText": "The growth of women’s football in England has been one of the most significant sporting stories of the past decade. From the Lionesses’ triumphs to the rapid expansion of the Women’s Super League and the WSL2, the game has moved from the margins to the centre of the national sporting conversation.\n\nYet this growth hasn’t been uniform, and not every club has enjoyed the same surge in attendances or visibility.\n\nSunderland Women, a club with a proud history of developing elite talent and competing at the top level, have experienced a season in which attendances haven’t quite matched the broader sense of optimism surrounding the women’s game. Understanding why requires a nuanced look at several overlapping factors — from performances on the pitch to geographical realities, scheduling challenges and the shifting dynamics of football loyalties in the North East.\n\nSunderland’s women’s team has long been a paradox within the English game.\n\nOn one hand, the club has produced some of the finest players the country has seen, including Lucy Bronze, Jill Scott, Jordan Nobbs and Beth Mead. On the other, the team has often operated with weaker resources than many of its rivals — particularly since the restructuring of the women’s pyramid and the rise of heavily backed clubs.\n\nThis tension between heritage and modern competitiveness forms part of the backdrop to the question of attendance. Supporters in the North East are passionate, loyal and deeply knowledgeable, but they’re also discerning, and when a team isn’t consistently competing at the very top, it can be harder to attract casual fans or those who are new to the women’s game.\n\nPerformance isn’t the only factor, but it’s certainly one of the most visible.\n\nSunderland Women have enjoyed periods of strong form but they’ve also experienced inconsistency and in a league where momentum is everything, this can affect the size and enthusiasm of the crowd. Supporters are more likely to attend regularly when they feel they’re watching a team on an upward trajectory — one that’s pushing for promotion or challenging the established order.\n\nWhen results fluctuate, the emotional pull weakens slightly, especially for those who aren’talready deeply invested in the club. This isn’t unique to Sunderland — it’s a pattern seen across the women’s game, where attendances often correlate with league position, ambition and the sense of a club moving forward.\n\nHowever, to attribute the attendance issue solely to performances would be to overlook the broader context, as geography plays a significant role in shaping the matchday experience.\n\nSunderland Women play their home games at Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground in Hetton-le-Hole, a venue with a strong community feel but one that isn’t always the easiest for supporters to reach.\n\nFor fans living in Sunderland itself, the journey to Hetton can be inconvenient — particularly for those relying on public transport — and for supporters from further afield such as Newcastle or Durham, the location may feel even less accessible. In an era where convenience matters more than ever, especially for families and younger fans, the location of the ground can be a decisive factor.\n\nThe contrast with other clubs in the region is instructive.\n\nNewcastle United Women, for example, have benefited enormously from the decision to stage several fixtures at St James’ Park. The symbolism of playing at the men’s stadium, combined with the novelty factor and the club’s broader resurgence, has created a sense of occasion that draws in thousands of supporters who might not otherwise attend a women’s match.\n\nEven when Newcastle Women play at Kingston Park, the venue is still relatively central and well connected, whilst Durham Women have built a strong identity around their home at Maiden Castle, and although it isn’t in the city centre, it’s closely tied to the university community and benefits from a stable, loyal fanbase.\n\nSunderland’s situation is different. Eppleton is a ground blessed with character but it doesn’t have the same pull as a major stadium, nor does it sit within a large student population or a bustling urban centre.\n\nFor longstanding fans, the location may not be an issue but for the casual supporter or the family looking for an easy day out, it can be a barrier. The club has made efforts to promote fixtures and engage with the community, but the physical reality of the venue remains a challenge.\n\nScheduling is another factor that can’t be ignored, as women’s football fixtures often take place at times that are designed to avoid clashes with men’s matches, television broadcasts or other major sporting events.\n\nAlthough this is understandable from a logistical standpoint, it can result in kick off times that aren’t ideal for supporters.\n\nEarly Sunday afternoons, for example, can be difficult for families with other commitments, whereas midweek fixtures can be challenging for those who work irregular hours or rely on public transport. Sunderland Women have played their share of games at times that don’t necessarily maximise attendance potential, and this is compounded by the travel considerations already mentioned.\n\nThe broader landscape of women’s football in the North East also plays a role, and the region is unique in that it has three prominent women’s teams — Sunderland, Newcastle and Durham — each of whom boasts its own identity, ambitions and fanbase.\n\nIn recent years, Newcastle Women have captured a significant amount of attention, fuelled by the momentum of the men’s team, increased investment, and the novelty of large‑scale fixtures at St James’ Park. For many supporters in the region, especially younger fans or those new to the women’s game, Newcastle may feel like the more exciting or accessible option. The club’s marketing has been strong, and the sense of being part of a growing movement has resonated with supporters.\n\nDurham Women, meanwhile, have carved out a niche as a stable, community‑focused club with a clear identity and a loyal following. Their matches often attract consistent crowds and their connection to the university gives them a built‑in audience that Sunderland can’t easily replicate. For neutral fans or those without a strong allegiance, Durham may offer a more convenient or appealing matchday experience.\n\nThese factors create a competitive environment in which Sunderland Women must work harder to attract and retain supporters.\n\nThe club’s history and identity are strong but in the current landscape, history alone isn’t always enough to draw large crowds. Supporters have more options than ever before, and the rise of Newcastle Women in particular has shifted the balance of attention in the region.\n\nAnother element worth considering is the visibility and marketing of the team, and while Sunderland AFC has a large and passionate fanbase, the women’s team doesn’t always receive the same level of promotion as some of its rivals.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily due to a lack of effort, but rather the reality of competing for attention within a club structure where the men’s team dominates the narrative. When Newcastle Women play at St James’ Park, the event is heavily publicised (often weeks in advance) and the sense of occasion is amplified by the scale of the venue. However, Sunderland Women, playing at a smaller ground, don’t have the same platform, and this can affect the reach of their promotional efforts.\n\nMedia coverage also plays a role. Local press attention for women’s football has improved, but it’s still uneven, and clubs with larger or more dramatic storylines tend to receive more coverage.\n\nNewcastle’s rise has created a compelling narrative and Durham’s stability has earned them respect, but Sunderland’s story has been more complex, shaped by financial constraints, league restructuring and the challenge of rebuilding. This complexity doesn’t always translate into headlines and without consistent media visibility, it can be harder to attract new supporters.\n\nThere’s also the question of expectations.\n\nSunderland Women were once one of the dominant forces in English women’s football and for longtime supporters, the memory of competing at the highest level remains vivid.\n\nWhen the team isn’t challenging for promotion or pushing the top sides, there can be a sense of frustration or disappointment — even if the performances are solid. This emotional context can influence attendance, as supporters may feel less inclined to attend regularly when the team isn’t perceived to be fulfilling its potential.\n\nAt the same time, it’s important to recognise that the women’s game is still evolving, and attendance patterns aren’t fixed.\n\nSunderland Women has a strong foundation, a committed core of supporters and a history that few clubs can match. The challenge is to translate these strengths into consistent attendance growth — and that requires a multifaceted approach. Improving performances on the pitch will always help, but so too will addressing the practical barriers that affect supporters’ ability to attend matches.\n\nOne potential avenue is exploring opportunities to play occasional fixtures at the Stadium of Light.\n\nAlthough this may not be feasible for every match, staging selected games at the main stadium could create a sense of occasion similar to that which Newcastle have achieved. It would also make the matches more accessible for supporters in Sunderland and could attract new fans who are curious about the women’s team but haven’t yet made the trip to Hetton. The club has experimented with this in the past, and expanding these efforts could be a valuable step.\n\nAnother area of focus could be enhancing the matchday experience at Eppleton.\n\nWhile the ground has its limitations, it also has the potential to offer a welcoming, community‑driven atmosphere that appeals to families and younger supporters. Improving facilities, increasing engagement activities and creating a more vibrant environment could help to offset the challenges of the location.\n\nCommunity outreach is also crucial.\n\nSunderland is a city with a deep-seated footballing culture, and there’s significant potential to build stronger connections between the women’s team and local schools, youth clubs and community groups. The more visible the players are within the community, the more likely it is that supporters will feel a personal connection to the team — and that this can translate into higher attendances.\n\nUltimately, the question of why Sunderland Women’s attendances haven’t been as strong as many hoped this season doesn’t have a single answer.\n\nIt’s a combination of performances, location, scheduling, competition from other local teams and the broader dynamics of the women’s game. Each factor plays a part; together they create a complex landscape that the club must navigate, yet there’s also reason for optimism.\n\nThe women’s game continues to grow, and Sunderland Women remain an important part of that story.\n\nWith strategic planning, community engagement and continued investment, the club has the potential to increase attendances and re‑establish itself as a major force in the region. The passion of the North East for football is unmatched and there’s no reason that Sunderland Women can’t tap into that passion more effectively in the seasons to come.\n\nThe challenge now is to build on the foundations that already exist, address the barriers that have held attendances back and create a compelling vision for the future. If the club can do that, there’s every chance that the stands will begin to fill once again and that Sunderland Women will take their rightful place at the heart of the region’s footballing landscape.",

    "fullText": "Every once in a while, even at our highest point arguably for decades, Sunderland AFC love to administer a well-timed punch in the gut just to keep everyone on our toes, and Wednesday night’s trip to Brentford was a textbook example.\n\nJust as the post-Christmas cobwebs were almost blown off, the fixture list threw up a second London away game in four days. I deliberated for some time whether to take any leave for this one, either to get to the pub early or to enjoy a post-game lie-in on Thursday, and in the end opted for neither, reasoning that a short trip to the other side of the capital is not a sensible use of paid holiday. At least my future self will be grateful for that, but the present version thinks the past one is a bastard.\n\nAnyway, I was at least able to steal out of the office earlier than usual having started early and headed post-haste to the Rose and Crown in Kew Green where the branch would be congregating. Some of the club’s media team were present to interview some of us about our experiences following the Lads from the capital and predictions for the game. You can have a read of our chairman Matthew’s thoughts here.\n\nShameless plug over, time to focus on the football. Brentford would inevitably present a tough proposition, having surged in December from lower mid-table to sit above us in the league on goal difference. Their in-form forward Igor Thiago clearly took it personally after I removed him from my fantasy league team, smashing in a hat-trick against Everton, but our defence has handled similarly dangerous strikers this season quite well, so we hoped we might manage to keep him quiet.\n\nThe Gtech Community Stadium is of course a new ground for Sunderland, so that on its own was enough of a reason to tempt so many to make the long journey south. It was a short walk from Kew Green across the river to the stadium; this really would be a lovely trip if it weren’t on a freezing midweek night in early January. The stewards wouldn’t have been out of place working in government security, going through everyone’s wallets with a fine-toothed comb, but thankfully we made it to our seats in time for kick-off.\n\nThe compact away end actually made for a great atmosphere – far better than at Spurs on Sunday – as chants from the fans were able to carry across and be picked up much more easily. Brentford played their incredibly unoriginal anthem to the tune of “Hey Jude”, and the Lads kicked off in blue and white attacking the far end. The opening exchanges were relatively even, but then Brentford began to turn the screw, and our defence was split apart far too easily as Thiago rounded Roefs to make it 1-0.\n\nWe made it in at half-time with just a single-goal deficit, and over a pint of London Pride we reasoned that a second-half improvement similar to what we produced at Spurs should see us claim at least a point.\n\nA golden opportunity to level was presented to us after Brobbey did brilliantly to win a penalty, but I was hesitant to celebrate too much given Brentford keeper Kelleher’s excellent record from the spot. In the end Le Fée’s ridiculous Panenka attempt could probably have been saved by anyone from the away end, even those who’d spent four hours on the train with a crate of Cruzcampo. It was a bizarre moment of idiocy from a brilliant player, and we can only hope he learns the requisite lessons from it.\n\nI would argue that it was the manner of the missed penalty rather than the miss itself that spurred Brentford on to such a degree and completely dashed the wind from our sails. The second goal was frankly embarrassing to watch as we were let out of jail initially when the ball hit the crossbar, only for our defence to fail to pick up Thiago again as he headed low into the corner. Brentford’s third was the kind of sloppy goal teams concede when their heads have completely dropped. We huffed and puffed, and a few of last season’s heroes in the shape of Neil and O’Nien were given a run-out, but the game was long since done as a contest.\n\nBack at the packed Express Tavern waiting for the Tube traffic to die down, we were given a brief morale boost as Leeds took the lead at St James’ Park, only for the Mags to overturn the deficit and climb above us in the table for the first time this season.\n\nAll in all it was a pretty miserable night, but there are obvious mitigating factors. This was simply a game too far for a squad that has been stretched beyond its limits by injury and international call-ups. The cup game at the weekend will likely be seen as a chance for mass rotation, and while it is a shame to essentially sacrifice our only slim chance at silverware for the season, it seems to be the only logical approach in the circumstances. This team has bounced back many times before, and with the imminent reinforcements from Africa incoming, you’d back them to do it again.",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza vs. Dante Moore: The key stats you need to know in 2026 NFL Draft debate originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza and Dante Moore didn't have much of a Big Ten quarterback duel when Indiana beat Oregon in the college football regular season. But now that both QBs have led their teams to playoff semifinals, a lot more is at stake.\n\nWhen Mendoza's Hoosiers have their rematch with Moore's Ducks in Friday's Peach Bowl in Atlanta, there will be a trip to the national championship game at stake. The outcome and the related performances will also help determine which QB goes to the top of the draft class in 2026.\n\nWith the Las Vegas Raiders and New York Jets having the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks and badly needing quarterbacks, the franchises will spend a lot of time on vetting Mendoza vs. Moore.\n\nBetween arm strength, accuracy, pocket presence and intangibles, there's a lot to like about Mendoza (6-5, 225), the Heisman Trophy winner, and Moore, a well-rounded talent. But their head-to-head stats will no doubt have some influence on who ends up coming off the board first.\n\nHere's looking at their seasons before playing again, including what happened in the previous matchup on Oct. 11:\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT: Where Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore land in latest projections\n\nMoore had more volume, but in terms of efficiency and every other category, Mendoza stood out as the worthy Heisman winner, with Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Ohio State's Julian Sayin making the cut over Moore as finalists. Neither Mendoza nor Moore would be considered dual threats with their running, but they have enough wheels to extend pass plays and rush for key yardage in big moments.\n\nHere are the numbers both QBs put when facing each other's tough defenses back on Oct. 11, played at Oregon's Autzen Stadium:\n\nThat wasn't the best showcase game for either QB, given the respective degrees of difficulty. Mendoza did outplay Moore. Expect both QBs to perform much better as more seasoned and playoff-winning passers almost three months later.\n\nMORE: Five players to watch in the Indiana vs. Oregon CPF semifinal\n\nThe Raiders already are on the clock for April 23 in Pittsburgh. Given the influence of former Big Ten passer Tom Brady as part-owner, he has a tough decision to make for the new face of the franchise. Mendoza, given his gritty profile and clutch confidence, would seem to fit better as the Raiders' savior.\n\nMoore, meanwhile, might be the right QB on whom the Jets can take a shot with his mental and physical attributes to deliver for Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand, who coached Jared Goff in Detroit. Another QB such as Alabama's Ty Simpson could emerge in the conversation, but for now, Mendoza is the man.\n\nThere's a long way to go in the draft process, however, including the Combine and pro days.

    "description": "I would love to see Speakman and Ghisolfi deliver another recruitment masterclass before the transfer window closes, but I am totally relaxed about the prospect of finishing the season with the players we currently have.",
    "fullText": "It’s the January transfer window, traditionally a time of angst for long-suffering Sunderland supporters. In recent years we have been scrabbling around to fill gaps in the squad – the elusive “proven striker”, a battle-hardened centre-half to help with a defensive injury crisis, or a midfield maestro to replace a stricken Corry Evans.\n\nThis season is different and, for once, I am not actually worried whether or not we sign anyone in this transfer window. Don’t get me wrong – in years gone by Sunderland have picked up some January gems. Last year it was Enzo Le Fée – a transfer that literally no one saw coming. Could Championship Sunderland prise such a supremely talented midfielder away from Serie A? Thankfully we had an ace in the pack – the relationship between Le Fée and his fellow Frenchman Régis Le Bris proved crucial as we completed an improbable acquisition.\n\nTen years previously, January 2015 heralded the arrival of a genuine Sunderland legend. In what could properly be described as the heist of the century, Jozy Altidore headed to the MLS to join Toronto while Jermain Defoe arrived on Wearside from the opposite direction.\n\nOther than January 2022, which heralded the arrival of Jack Clarke, Patrick Roberts, and a young Irish lad by the name of Trai Hume, and the previous year when the Loch Ness Drogba signed, winter transfer windows have been more Will Grigg and Jaden Danns than anything exciting.\n\nBut that is not why I am so relaxed about this transfer window. It is more that improving the current squad is going to be very difficult in what is a notoriously challenging January market.\n\nI am setting myself up to be shot at but, in my view, when the AFCON players return we will be going into the second half of the season with a stronger squad at Le Bris’ disposal than he had in August.\n\nWhen the season kicked off with a resounding thumping of West Ham, Nordi Mukiele, Brian Brobbey, Bertrand Traoré, and Lutsharel Geertruida were still to sign. It was a month before Brobbey or Geertruida made their debuts against Crystal Palace, and Traoré first appeared two weeks later.\n\nThey joined a squad with Dennis Cirkin and Romaine Mundle sidelined by long-term injuries.\n\nFast forward to now and the picture is very different – Mundle and Cirkin are both fit, with the latter putting in creditable performances against Manchester City and Spurs in the AFCON absence of Reinildo.\n\nBrobbey completed his first full 90 minutes against Tottenham in addition to his thumping finish, and the burly and brutal Dutch striker is looking very much the part of an effective Premier League hitman. What he probably needs is someone to get closer to him, as Enzo Le Fée did to create his goal.\n\nI have seen calls for the signing of a right-winger – I am not joining in with them. Bertrand Traoré is likely to return this week, and the relative veteran has clearly been delivering what Régis Le Bris wants in his system, having established himself as a regular starter. In addition Eliezer Mayenda has shown enough threat against Manchester City and Tottenham that he offers a genuine option to replace Traoré in the latter stages. He also has the potential of playing closer to Brobbey as a second striker.\n\nElsewhere there are no obvious gaps – Roefs is firmly established between the sticks. Defensive options are strong – Hume, Geertruida, Mukiele, Ballard, Alderete, Reinildo, and Cirkin are all fit and available. In midfield Xhaka, Diarra, Sadiki, and Le Fée will cause a selection headache for Le Bris, with Geertruida and Rigg able to step in.\n\nOn the left wing Simon Adingra is starting to show why we were happy to trade him for Tommy Watson; Chemsdine Talbi has already demonstrated the threat that he brings. Romaine Mundle is still getting to grips with Premier League-standard defenders but has already shown that he can deliver the defensive graft that Le Bris’ system demands.\n\nIf I had to pick one position I would like to see strengthened in this window, it would be another central midfielder. But where the hell do you find another Granit Xhaka?\n\nBefore anyone slings the “lack of ambition” accusation at me, let me say this clearly – if there is a player (or players) out there available at a not-extortionate price, let’s go and get them. Offer me another Le Fée or a Defoe and I’ll snap your hand off (up to the elbow!).\n\nBut I don’t expect that the Louis-Dreyfus regime will sanction any acquisition unless it is a player who will genuinely improve the squad and, such is the quality now available to Régis Le Bris, that will not be easy.\n\nJust as importantly, any new arrival will have to possess the right character to fit comfortably into the mentality of the squad that Le Bris has so carefully curated, incorporating the best of the squad that achieved promotion with the high-quality summer signings, and fully buy into the “’Til the end” spirit that typifies the Sunderland of 2026.\n\nI would love to see Speakman and Ghisolfi deliver another recruitment masterclass before the transfer window closes, but I am totally relaxed about the prospect of finishing the season with the players we currently have. Without the AFCON contingent we have held our own. With them back in the fold, no one will relish facing the Black Cats.",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Penguins stayed hot on Thursday, notching their sixth straight win with a 4-1 victory over the New Jersey Devils at PPG Paints Arena.\n\nThe Penguins got a boost from Evgeni Malkin, who returned from an upper-body injury after missing over a month. Malkin scored in his first game since Dec. 4, notching his ninth goal of the season and the 523rd of his career.\n\nNot surprisingly, the three-time Stanley Cup champion got plenty of love from Pittsburgh fans in his return to the ice, especially after scoring.\n\nAfter the game, Malkin praised Penguins fans for their support and gave the Steelers a special shout-out ahead of their upcoming playoff game against the Houston Texans.\n\nEvgeni Malkin: \"Love our fans. Always amazing to play at home. Thanks to all the fans… Steelers play Monday. People love sports here. Good luck to Steelers, too, as well.\"\n\n— Pens Inside Scoop (@PensInsideScoop) January 9, 2026\n\n“Love our fans. Always amazing to play at home. Thanks to all the fans,” Malkin told reporters after the game. “Steelers play Monday. People love sports here. Good luck to the Steelers, too, as well.”\n\nNow in his 20th season with the Penguins, Malkin knows how special Pittsburgh fans are and how passionate they are about their sports teams. He’s given them plenty to cheer for during his two decades with the Penguins, including another win and goal on Thursday night.\n\nMeanwhile, the Steelers are preparing to host the Texans on Monday in the Wild Card Round. They just clinched the AFC North in Week 18 with a wild win over the Baltimore Ravens, so they’re hoping to replicate that success on Monday and earn their first postseason win in nine years.\n\nMore Penguins: Penguins Announce Roster Move Ahead Of Matchup Vs.

    "description": "Hendricks led the MAC in receiving yards in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Ohio Bobcats won 30 games across the past three seasons and one player pertinent to that success is headed elsewhere.\n\nOhio’s star wide receiver Chase Hendricks found his transfer portal destination, committing to California after three years as a Bobcat. In three seasons, Hendricks accumulated 1,616 yards and eight touchdowns on 122 receptions, with the majority of his production transpiring in 2024.\n\nHendricks led the entire MAC in receiving yards at 1,037 in a breakout 2025 campaign, while also checking in at second in the conference in receptions (71) and tied for fourth in receiving touchdowns (7). He served as the overwhelming No. 1 target for the 9-4 Bobcats, as the next closest teammate had 30 receptions and 419 yards receiving. 2025 marked Hendricks’ first year in the WR1 role, and it was clear from the opening drive in Week 1 that he’d be poised for a stellar season.\n\nHe produced 100 receiving yards in six of his first eight games this season and snagged 8+ receptions five times (maxing out at 10 vs. Northern Illinois and Eastern Michigan). Hendricks concluded his three-year Ohio stint with an 87-yard outing in a Frisco Bowl victory over UNLV, which represented the Bobcats’ sixth-straight bowl win.\n\nIn 2024, Hendricks was second on the team in receptions (40) and receiving yards (471) for a MAC champion Ohio team. He also earned playing time as a true freshman in 2023, recording 11 catches and 108 yards for a 10-3 Bobcat squad.\n\nThe St. Louis, MO native heads west to California where he joins a loaded Golden Bears receiving corps that features Rutgers transfer Ian Strong and 2025 FBS receptions leader Jacob De Jesus. As for Ohio, the Bobcats now must find a new No. 1 wide receiver — and 2026 will present the team’s fourth different receiving yards leader in four years. Ohio’s second-leading receiver Rodney Harris II is also in the transfer portal, leaving Dom Dorwart (11 receptions and 119 receiving yards in 2025) as the leading returner in production.",

    "description": "No. 1 Fishers gets buzzer beater (times two) to roll to big lead over No. 4 Pike. Red Devils' rally falls short.",
    "fullText": "FISHERS – For three quarters, No. 1 Fishers delivered about as clear of a statement as possible against fourth-ranked Pike, especially considering its most talented player was on the bench in street clothes.\n\nThe fourth quarter? Well, that is something Fishers’ coach Garrett Winegar can use as motivation in practice. A myriad of turnovers and mistakes against Pike’s full-court press turned a blowout in a relatively close 76-67 Tigers’ win on Thursday night in front of a packed gym.\n\n“I think this game added a little bit of fire to us,” said Fishers junior guard Cooper Zachary, who drained two near-replica shots from just inside halfcourt at the end of the first and second quarters. “Just because everyone is like, ‘Pike, Crown Point, Fishers – who is No. 1?’ It’s kind of a three-way race. So tonight felt like a way to end that talk for one of the teams. And I think we did a good job of that until the fourth quarter.”\n\nFishers (11-0) led from the outset, going ahead by as many as 13 points early in the second quarter before Pike pulled within five on a basket by Landon Lampley. But the Tigers dominated the final two minutes of the first half, punctuated by Zachary’s 3-pointer from just inside the halfcourt line to give his team a 38-23 lead going into the break.\n\nThe shot was remarkably similar to the shot Zachary hit as the first quarter ended.\n\n“I think his percentage right now is better from 45 feet than anywhere else,” Fishers coach Garrett Winegar joked. “He’s got ‘in the gym’ range and he has ultimate freedom from us. He’s earned that. He’s puts in the time. No one works harder than him in the state and I can guarantee that. It’s pretty simple in those situations that he needs to get the ball.”\n\nFishers carried that momentum into the second half and looked to be on the verge of running away with the game, leading by as many as 22 points in the third quarter and taking a 63-45 lead into the fourth.\n\nThen, T.J. Davis happened. The 5-9 senior sparked the Red Devils (9-2) on offense and defense, finishing with a team-high 20 points and two steals. Pike’s zone press created all kinds of issues for Fishers, which was playing without star junior guard Jason Gardner Jr. for the sixth consecutive game as he recovers from a broken bone in his left hand.\n\nPike pulled as close as seven points but ran out of time. Fishers finished with a whopping 25 turnovers.\n\n“I feel like that was good for us,” Zachary said of the fourth quarter. “What do we get out of a 30-point win? Everyone on our team probably would have been like, ‘Well, we just beat Pike by 30,’ and get too high on ourselves. But now we can see that even in a big win like that, we still have work to do.”\n\nEthan Hillsman, a 6-7 senior who just became eligible last weekend, led Fishers with 20 points on 8-for-11 shooting, including a pair of 3-pointers. Senior Kai McGrew added 16 points, 11 rebounds, three assists and three blocked shots and Levi Walker had 15 points and six rebounds. Zachary was also in double figures with 12 points, all on 3s.\n\n“We’re without our one-man press breaker right now,” Winegar said of Gardner. “Honestly, it’s probably on me that I didn’t do more work to prepare for that situation. We have press breakers but we have new guys working in the lineups. We probably did a bad job with that. And we talked about playing with emotion, not being emotional. I thought we went the opposite of that and played emotional.”\n\nThe loss came just two days after Pike narrowly avoided defeat in a 48-44 overtime win over Noblesville. In addition to Davis, the Red Devils were led by sophomore Landon Lampley’s 14 points and seven rebounds, Jahari Miller’s 13 points, four steals and four rebounds and Kenneth Lampley’s 10 points and two steals.\n\nPike had an eight-game winning streak coming into Thursday’s game and had not lost to an in-state team. The only previous loss came to Wisconsin Lutheran, 68-65 in overtime, the night before Thanksgiving.\n\n“That’s a good team and they are playing at home,” Pike coach Jeff Teague said. “That was probably the biggest crowd we’ve played in front of. We’re a young team, but it’s a good experience for them to play a team that’s well trained and like a well-oiled machine.”\n\nPike will get back to it next week in the Marion County Tournament, opening at Brebeuf Jesuit on Tuesday in the first round. The Red Devils might have found something in the fourth quarter that can carry over.\n\n“We have a lot of work to do,” Davis said. “We’re not there yet. But we’ll get back at it at practice (on Friday). If we played like we did in the fourth quarter, we would have won. But we just started so slow.”\n\nFishers will play on Saturday against Cardinal Ritter (Mo.) at Highland, Ill.\n\nWith the Indiana-Oregon Peach Bowl game on Friday, several games were moved to Thursday to make for a busier night than usual. Some of the other games of note:\n\n*Hamilton Southeastern rallied for a 66-64 road win over Lawrence Central to improve to 5-6. Landon Osswald led HSE with 18 points. Luke Weemer added 17 points and Varschon Clark had 15 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n\n*Class 4A No. 7 Plainfield defeated Avon 75-36 and Brownsburg knocked off Tri-West 66-45 to set up the Hendricks County Tournament championship matchup for Saturday night at Danville. Plainfield will play Brownsburg at about 7:45 p.m., following the girls’ championship.\n\n*University defeated Scecina 67-63 in overtime, rallying from a 10-point fourth quarter deficit. Josh Henderson scored 17 points to lead four players in double figures for University, which improved to 8-3. Scecina (6-3) was led by 27 points from senior Bryce Mathis.\n\n*Standout sophomore Noah Washington scored 30 points as New Albany rolled to a 79-56 win over rival Jeffersonville.\n\nCall Star reporter Kyle Neddenriep at (317) 444-6649.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOle Miss players likely didn’t spend their College Football Playoff run wondering what former coach Lane Kiffin was up to or what he had to say, but the rest of the college football world has had just about no escape from Kiffin since he bolted for LSU in November.\n\nThe highly paid coach has long been active on social media, even amid a tumultuous few weeks that saw him leave Oxford for Baton Rouge, and he followed Ole Miss’ journey to the semifinals every step of the way.\n\nAfter the Rebels lost a thrilling Fiesta Bowl on Thursday night and saw their run come to an end, Kiffin reacted on X.\n\nHere’s a look at what Kiffin had to say about his former team and the officials after Ole Miss was eliminated.\n\nMORE:Why Lane Kiffin left Ole Miss for LSU\n\nKiffin tweeted a broken heart gif after Ole Miss' defeat, but he praised the Rebels for \"amazing effort and grit\" despite the loss.\n\n\"Best season ever in the history of Ole Miss!!\" Kiffin said, certainly remembering that he was part of it for the first 12 games.\n\nOnce the dust settled, though, Kiffin had a bone to pick with the officials for their decision not to call a penalty on the final play of the game.\n\nKiffin argued De'Zhaun Stribling was interfered with on Ole Miss' Hail Mary attempt at the end of the fourth quarter, with replay showing Stribling grabbed by a defender and at least partly pulled down.\n\nPass interference 💯!!! https://t.co/99jrGosJ5w\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) January 9, 2026\n\nPass interference calls are generally rare on Hail Mary attempts because of the amount of hand fighting that is naturally part of a scrum, but some on Ole Miss' side — including coach Pete Golding, who gestured toward the officials when the clock struck zero — believed Miami put the Stribling at enough of a disadvantage to necessitate a penalty.\n\nMORE:Explaining the no-call at end of Fiesta Bowl\n\nWhile Miami will play on, Ole Miss' loss might be some final closure on what became a months-long saga with Lane Kiffin at the center. Kiffin and LSU will focus on the 2026 season, while Golding will get the chance to fully prepare for his first season at Ole Miss once he finds out whether Trinidad Chambliss will be his quarterback.",

    "description": "Humans can accurately sense the position, speed, and torque of their limbs, even with their eyes shut. This sense, known as proprioception, allows humans to pr…",
    "fullText": "Today’s conventional prosthetic limbs do not provide feedback to the nervous system. Because of this, people with amputated limbs cannot feel the position, speed, and torque of their prosthetic joints without looking at them, making it difficult to control their movement. In order to create a more complete prosthetic control experience, researchers at the MIT Media Lab invented the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI). The AMI is a method to restore proprioception to persons with amputation.\n\nProprioception in people with intact biological limbs is mediated by biological sensors in muscles acting in opposition to each other in relation to a single joint. To replicate this feedback in an amputated residuum, an AMI is made up of two muscles – an agonist and an antagonist – connected mechanically; when the agonist contracts, the antagonist is stretched, and vice versa. The purpose of an AMI is to control and interpret proprioceptive feedback from a bionic joint. During an amputation procedure, a surgeon creates AMIs by linking together muscle pairs within the amputated residuum. Multiple AMI muscle pairs can be created for the control and sensation of multiple prosthetic joints. Artificial muscle electrodes placed over each AMI muscle communicate with small computers within an advanced bionic limb that control movement of the bionic joints. As the bionic limb moves, the AMIs enable a person with limb amputation to feel its positions and movements. The AMI was validated in extensive pre-clinical experimentation at MIT, prior to surgical implementation in a human patient at Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospital and bionic implementation at MIT.\n\nIn the first human implementation of the AMI, discussed in a paper recently published in Science Translational Medicine (May 30, 2018), we surgically constructed two AMIs within the residual limb of a patient at the time of his below-knee amputation. Each AMI sends control signals to one joint of a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis, and provides proprioceptive information pertaining to the movement of that joint back to the patient’s central nervous system. When the patient moves his phantom limb, the re-connected muscles move naturally in dynamic pairs, sending proprioceptive information through nerves to his brain. He consequently experiences natural sensations of ankle-foot positions and movements even when blindfolded. This AMI patient has better intentional control over movement of a bionic prosthesis, compared to a group of patients with traditional amputation. In addition, when he walks up and down stairs all the natural movement patterns mediated by the central nervous system emerge through his synthetic limb as an involuntary, reflexive behavior. In these trials, the intricacies of natural foot placement during stair ascent and descent emerged before our eyes, without the patient consciously trying to move his bionic limb. Furthermore, we describe the first-ever system for closed-loop joint control with natural neural feedback of prosthetic joint torque, and show that this system improves function.\n\nIn addition to these functional improvements, the AMI patient also moves and behaves as though the bionic limb is part of him. After a few minutes of wearing it for the first time, we asked the patient to describe his relationship with the device, and he said, “The robot became part of me.” Because the patient’s nervous system was connected to the prosthesis in a bi-directional manner, neurological embodiment was achieved.  This is an example of a design paradigm that we call NeuroEmbodied Design. In this design process, the designer designs human flesh and bone–the biological body itself–along with synthetics, to enhance bi-directional communication between a human’s nervous system and the built world. “Previously humans have used technology in a tool-like fashion,” senior author and project director Professor Hugh Herr says. “We are now starting to see a new era of human-device interaction, of full neurological embodiment, in which what we design becomes truly part of us, part of our identity.”  We see a future in which our designed world will be carefully integrated within our nature: a world in which what is biological and what is not, what is human and what is not, what is nature and what is not, will be forever blurred.\n\nJim Ewing, the first patient to undergo an AMI procedure, was injured several years ago while rock climbing in the Cayman Islands. The surgical operation he underwent, in which AMIs were implemented from native muscles at the time of below-knee amputation, was named the \"Ewing Amputation\" in his honor. Rebuilt as a cyborg, Jim returned to the Caymans to climb once again.",

Google is counting on its massive customer base to provide an advantage as the company takes on the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic and others in the booming generative AI market.\n\nGoogle says Gmail now has more than 3 billion users.\n\nLast year, Google's Gemini integration in Gmail allowed users to do things like search messages, draft emails from prompts, improve grammar and generate custom responses.\n\nOne of the new features is \"Suggested Replies,\" which Google says uses the context of a user's emails to create one-click responses. It's an update to a prior tool called \"Smart Replies.\" The company is also upgrading a proofreading option for checking grammar and making messages more concise.\n\nDriven by its rapid advancements in AI, Google parent Alphabet topped Apple by market cap on Wednesday for the first time since 2019, continuing a rally that made the stock the best performer among tech megacaps last year. Meanwhile, OpenAI soared to a private market valuation of $500 billion late last year, and Anthropic said Wednesday that it's valued at $350 billion in a new funding round.\n\n— CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this report.\n\nWATCH: How Gemini is gaining ground on ChatGPT",

Gauba is now a member of a top government think tank.\n\nIndia's finance ministry ⁠and the prime minister's office did not respond to Reuters requests ​for comment.\n\nLast year, Modi visited China for the first time in ​seven years and agreed to foster deeper commercial ties with Beijing following U.S. President Donald Trump's 50% punitive tariff on Indian goods and in light of Washington's warming relations with Pakistan.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A complicated crime scene and uncooperative witnesses hindered Salt Lake City police efforts to investigate a fatal shooting outside a house of worship belonging to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nThe shooting in a church parking lot Wednesday night left two people dead and six injured, including five who remained hospitalized with police protection Thursday. Investigators said the shooting erupted from a dispute between people who knew each other and were attending a funeral.\n\nNo arrests had been made as of early Thursday evening. Authorities say they do not know whether the shooting was gang-related and that they are having trouble getting witnesses to cooperate.\n\nPolice do not believe the shooting was random or motivated by animus against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church.\n\n“Our houses of worship are sacred, whatever the affiliation,” Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said Thursday. “We should all protect those spaces. We should all respect those spaces.”\n\nAll the shooting victims were adults. Vaea Tulikihihifo, 46, and Sione Vatuvei, 38, were identified as the two people killed.\n\nThe red brick church in northwest Salt Lake City mostly serves Tongan congregants and holds regular worship services in their native tongue, according to its website.\n\nLatter-day Saint missionaries first arrived in Tonga in the early 1890s, according to the church’s website. At first, they had little success and the mission closed in 1897. But a decade later, missionaries opened a school in Neiafu, Tonga’s second-largest town, and began preaching across the islands. Dozens of other schools were started by missionaries and seven remain open. The church's membership in Tonga has grown to 68,000 and 175 congregations.\n\n“Since the 19th century, the church has had a really, really prominent place in Tongan society. Depending on who you ask, somewhere between one-third and two-thirds of everybody who lives in Tonga are members of the LDS church,” said Matthew Bowman, a Claremont Graduate University professor specializing in U.S. religious history.\n\nToday, more than a quarter of the Tongan population in the U.S. resides in Utah, where the church is headquartered. The state's Tongan population is about 23,000 and is mostly concentrated in Salt Lake County, according to census data.\n\nOn Wednesday night, residents from a housing complex next to the church flooded outside to help victims and console dozens of people who had been attending a funeral for a man identified by family on social media as Asi Sekona. Several family members could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nBrennan McIntire said he and his wife, Kenna, heard several loud gunshots from their apartment next to the church parking lot while watching TV. He jumped off the couch and ran outside in flip-flops to see what happened.\n\n“As soon as I came over, I see someone on the ground,” he said. “People are attending to him and crying and arguing.”\n\nKenna McIntire came outside soon after and was rattled at the sight of first responders lifting an unconscious woman into an ambulance while people huddled around and sobbed.\n\nThe couple said they hear gunshots in their neighborhood almost daily, but never right outside their door.\n\n“It was really heartbreaking to hear and see,” Kenna McIntire said.\n\nAbout 100 law enforcement vehicles were at the scene in the aftermath, and helicopters flew overhead. Police said they were reviewing license plate readers and surveillance videos from nearby businesses in their search for suspects.\n\nThe church was cooperating with law enforcement and said it was grateful for first responders' quick efforts.\n\n“We extend prayers for all who have been impacted by this tragedy and express deep concern that any sacred space intended for worship should be subjected to violence of any kind,” church spokesperson Sam Penrod said.\n\nLatter-day Saints have been on heightened alert since four people were killed when a former Marine opened fire in one of their churches in Michigan in September and set it ablaze. The FBI found that he was motivated by “anti-religious beliefs” against the church.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of Vaea Tulikihihifo’s last name, which had previously been misspelled by Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd.\n\nBilleaud reported from Phoenix.

    "fullText": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has often been accused by critics of delivering North Korea–style propaganda on behalf of her boss, President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, some suggested she’d taken the comparison a step further by dressing the part too.\n\nSocial media users joked that Leavitt’s outfit for a White House press briefing bore a resemblance (in its color at the very least) to the signature look of North Korean state TV anchor Ri Chun-hee, whose bombastic broadcasts defending the so-called Hermit Kingdom’s dictator Kim Jong Un have for years gone viral online.\n\n“Leavitt was wearing Ri Chun-hee’s outfit today,” journalist Aaron Rupar joked on X, the Elon Musk-owned platform formerly known as Twitter, in a post that racked up more than 300,000 views.\n\nWriter Hemant Mehta echoed the sentiment, noting: “Probably doesn’t help that she’s wearing the North Korean news anchor colors while saying this.”\n\nOthers took the joke further, sharing altered images that appeared to place Leavitt, who announced last month that she is pregnant with her second child, directly into Ri’s on-air wardrobe and arguing that their messaging sounded strikingly similar too.\n\nTrump Admits Melania Hates These 2 Things He Does\n\nTrump’s Rambling House GOP Speech Gets The Most Brutal Edit From Kimmel\n\nTrump’s New Nickname For Himself Fails To Clean Up With Critics",

    "description": "TikTok told some US staff that they will work for a new global entity that is not a part of the new joint venture run by Oracle and others.",
    "fullText": "TikTok is preparing to carve off parts of its US business, but not all US workers are joining the new entity.\n\nSome US staff were told this week that they will not work for the new joint venture, called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, led by managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. Instead, they will work for a separate TikTok global entity that will remain under ByteDance's ownership, called TT Commerce & Global Services LLC.\n\nThe change, outlined in a memo sent to impacted employees, includes workers who focus on US products that will remain tied to TikTok's global operations after the sale closes. In December, TikTok's CEO Shou Chew told staff those business lines would include \"certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\"\n\nOther US workers, such as those focused on data protection or algorithm security, would work under the USDS Joint Venture entity, according to Chew's memo. He said the deal would close on January 22.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the staffing change.\n\nIf the proposed TikTok deal goes through, Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake would each own 15% of the new US joint venture. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors would get around 30%. Five percent would go to an unnamed group of new investors, and ByteDance would keep just under 20% of the business to comply with the ownership requirements of the US divestment law that sparked the sale.\n\nThe law, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requires companies based in countries the US has deemed a foreign adversary to divest from their US assets or face hefty fines.\n\nCongress called out TikTok and China-based ByteDance in the law's text. TikTok challenged the law in court but lost its case in a Supreme Court ruling last January.\n\nPresident Donald Trump allowed the app to continue to operate last year via a series of executive orders as his administration worked with TikTok and prospective buyers on a potential deal. In September, the White House announced a deal had been reached, which Vice President JD Vance said would value TikTok US at around $14 billion.",

    "fullText": "Meta's Chief Technology Officer and head of Reality Labs, Andrew Bosworth, has called an all-hands meeting for January 14, describing it as the \"most important\" of the year.\n\nBosworth is also strongly recommending that Reality Labs employees attend the division's meeting in person, two Meta employees told Business Insider.\n\nThe emphasis on in-person attendance is unusual for the division, which oversees the company's wearables, virtual and augmented reality initiatives, and a nascent robotics unit, these employees said. Some managers have told employees to \"drop what they're doing\" to attend the all-hands in person, one employee told Business Insider.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the meeting.\n\nWhile the division has seen some success, such as its Ray-Ban smart glasses, Reality Labs has been a costly venture for Meta, incurring losses of more than $70 billion since 2020.\n\nLast year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shifted the company's strategic focus toward AI and away from the metaverse. In 2025, Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, Alexandr Wang, as part of the major reset of the company's AI efforts. Meta then embarked on a multibillion-dollar hiring spree, poaching top-tier AI researchers and engineers from rivals such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n\nReality Labs has faced repeated rounds of cuts over the past year. In December, Business Insider reported that Meta was planning budget cuts up to 30% and considering job cuts in Reality Labs.\n\nLast April, Meta laid off employees in Oculus Studios, its in-house gaming division, and the team behind Supernatural, the VR fitness app Meta acquired for over $400 million. Those cuts followed Meta's broader January 2025 layoffs that eliminated nearly 4,000 roles companywide, with at least 560 affecting Reality Labs employees.\n\nIn a memo obtained by Business Insider earlier last year, Bosworth referred to 2025 as \"the most critical\" year in his eight-year tenure at Reality Labs.\n\n\"This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,\" he wrote.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that President Donald Trump's proposal to keep Wall Street players from buying single-family homes would not force them to sell their current holdings.\n\n\"These big institutions buy housing, then rent them out, and they're able to depreciate it. They hide their earnings, pay lower taxes,\" he said on Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota.\n\n\"The idea here is bygones are bygones,\" Bessent added. \"We're not going to have a forced sale here.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he would ban institutional investors from purchasing single-family homes in an effort to make housing more affordable for Americans. Single-family homes refer to standalone residential buildings with their own entrance designed for one household.\n\n\"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,\" Trump wrote on a Truth Social post. \"That American dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.\"\n\nShares of asset manager Blackstone fell 5.6% on Wednesday after Trump's post. Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, oversees one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the US, with several hundred thousand single-family homes and apartments. Other stocks similarly fell.\n\nCritics say firms like New York-based Blackstone put pressure on the housing market, reducing the availability of homes and driving prices up. Blackstone closed 1.1% higher at the end of the trading day on Thursday.\n\nThe institutional players, meanwhile, say lack of housing supply — not big-business ownership — is pushing prices up.\n\nIn Minnesota on Thursday, Bessent said that the administration has not decided on the \"exact contours\" of this new proposal.\n\n\"We want to keep the traditional mom and pop owners in. We want to keep families who rent out to their other family members,\" he said.\n\nBessent said that this practice of large firms buying up single-family homes started during the 2008 financial crisis, when private equity companies were among the few parties with the money to buy these homes.\n\n\"They hoovered up the single-family housing stock,\" he said.\n\nThe US Government Accountability Office found that in 2022, the five largest institutional investors owned nearly 2% of single-family rental homes.",

    "fullText": "General Motors has warned investors that its electric-vehicle strategy is proving costly — and that the pain is not yet over.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that it will record about $6 billion in fourth-quarter charges tied to scaling back EV plans in the US, with another $1.1 billion linked to restructuring in China.\n\nMost of the EV-related hits stem from contract cancellations, supplier settlements, and asset writedowns, GM said, as demand for battery-powered cars sputters.\n\nGM said the charge will be recorded as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings. It warned that additional EV-related costs are likely in 2026 as it continues negotiations with suppliers, though it expects those charges to be lower than last year's.\n\nThe automaker also said the writedown would not affect its roughly dozen electric models sold in the US.\n\n\"We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,\" it said in its filing.\n\nGM's announcement on Thursday follows a $1.6 billion writedown in the third quarter, which the automaker took as it began pivoting away from its EV strategy after an overhaul of US regulations under the Trump administration.\n\nTrump has reversed major EV-friendly measures from the Biden era, including the $7,500 federal EV tax credit that had underpinned consumer demand for electric vehicles.\n\nGM said in a sales release on Monday that its EV sales fell 43% in the fourth quarter after the consumer tax credit expired. The automaker has since rolled back its EV plans and returned to hybrids and gas-powered cars. This was a marked change from the EV ambitions laid out in 2021, when its CEO, Mary Barra, said the company aimed to become electric-only by 2035.\n\nGM's profit warning comes weeks after Ford said in December that it would scale back its EV production, a move expected to cost it nearly $20 billion.\n\n​​\"Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,\" the company said in a news release.\n\nOther carmakers have also announced changes to their EV plans in recent months. Honda, Jeep, and Ram have dropped current or planned EV models for the US market, while Porsche said in September it would take a €1.8 billion, or $2.2 billion, hit as it shifts back toward hybrids and gas vehicles.",

    "fullText": "We might think that everything that is to be discovered from our historical past has been discovered by hard working archeologists, but surprisingly that is not the case. Archaeologists are still making discoveries consistently, and even sometimes accidentally.\n\nRecently, researchers working in Lichtenau, a medieval town in North Rhine-Westphalia, a state in Germany, stumbled on a sizable underground vault while conducting routine excavations in the old town center. The structure, spanning more than 1,000 square feet, was situated near what was once a medieval castle in Lichtenau.\n\nPreliminary assessments suggest that the vaulted cellar could date to the town’s early development, which began in 1321, though the exact age and original purpose of the structure remain under investigation. Despite its significance, many questions linger: Who built it? What was it used for? And how did it survive, intact, beneath centuries of urban life?\n\nOfficials from the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association have emphasized that this kind of find (relatively large, well-preserved, and historically situated) offers a rare window into urban life and architectural practices from the town’s formative era. The discovery also highlights just how much remains buried beneath modern developments, especially in historic European towns.\n\nWhile experts have yet to date the Lichtenau structure precisely, its size and craftsmanship are intriguing. Vaulted cellars of this scale could have served a range of functions in a medieval town, such as:\n\nStorage for food, wine, or goods, especially in commercial hubs\n\nWorkspaces or artisan workshops where durable underground spaces offered stable temperatures\n\nFoundations for former buildings, whose upper levels no longer survive above ground\n\nBecause it lies near a known medieval castle site, researchers hope this discovery could reveal more about how Lichtenau was planned and how its economy and daily life operated in the early phases of its history.\n\nArchaeological surprises like this one reshape historical narratives. Discoveries found by accident often fill gaps that planned digs might miss, whether due to budget limits, modern construction, or shifting research priorities.\n\nAnd this isn’t an isolated phenomenon. Around the world, including in Germany itself, significant artifacts and structures have been uncovered by chance:\n\nA family on a casual walk uncovered a 3,500-year-old Bronze Age dagger sitting right on the surface after a rainstorm, a find that offers insights into prehistoric metallurgy and ritual practices.\n\nArchaeologists in Delbrück-Bentfeld uncovered multiple early Roman settlements and artifacts, shedding light on early community layouts in North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nIn eastern Germany, workers repairing infrastructure once unearthed Mesolithic burials, providing rare glimpses into the lives and deaths of Stone Age communities.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, unexpected discoveries, from buried WWII bunkers in Germany and Poland to hidden medieval tunnels in Belgium, continue to emerge during seemingly ordinary construction or restoration work.\n\nThese finds remind us that history isn’t just in museums; it literally surrounds us from beneath roads, under parks, and below everyday buildings. Each accidental discovery is a piece of the puzzle that helps archaeologists reconstruct human life over millennia.\n\nThe Lichtenau find highlights a broader lesson for communities worldwide: preserving historical context can pay great dividends. Investments in archaeological surveys before major construction projects can:\n\nPrevent damage to irreplaceable heritage\n\nUncover unknown chapters of local history\n\nFuel cultural tourism and community pride\n\nInspire new research directions\n\nFor citizens and casual observers, it’s a reminder that what looks like ordinary ground might be the roof over a forgotten room, workshop, or even entire neighborhood from ages past.\n\nWhat was once invisible beneath centuries of streets and rooftops is now a topic of conversation among scholars and history lovers alike. The discovery in Lichtenau underscores how history is always waiting to be revealed and is sometimes just beneath a cobblestone street or a patch of grass. And while researchers work to decipher the mystery of this underground space, we’re reminded that chance still plays a vital role in uncovering the stories of our collective past.",

    "fullText": "“Pod Save America” host Jon Favreau ripped Vice President JD Vance on X Thursday morning over the latter’s politically charged reaction to an ICE agent’s fatal Wednesday shooting of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump officials have en masse accused the woman in question of committing domestic terrorism by trying to run over the ICE agent who shot her to death. Others, including multiple Minnesota state officials and many who have seen video of the incident online, have called for the ICE agent to be held accountable for his use of force and for resorting to violent measures.\n\nVance, for his part, used a video of the woman’s car making contact with the ICE agent’s body as an opportunity to make a statement directed at Democrats.\n\n“Every congressional democrat and every democrat who’s running for president should be asked a simple question: Do you think this officer was wrong in defending his life against a deranged leftist who tried to run him over?” the vice president wrote on X. “These people are going to try to arrest our law enforcement for doing their jobs. The least the media could do is ask them about it.”\n\nFavreau quickly called out Vance’s use of “deranged leftist” to describe the victim, identified as U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good. “What the f—k is wrong with you?” the former speechwriter asked in a quote-tweet response to Vance’s original post.\n\n“You have no idea who this woman was. You have no idea what she believed,” he continued. “You have no idea what an actual investigation might show. A 37-year-old American citizen was killed. Her 6-year-old son has been orphaned. Her family and friends are going through the worst moment of their lives. And all you can do is call her a ‘deranged leftist’? Seriously what the f—k is wrong with you?”\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? \n\nYou have no idea who this woman was. You have no idea what she believed.

Her family and friends are going… https://t.co/QSuIv6KR4O\n\n— Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) January 8, 2026\n\nIn a press conference conducted shortly after the Wednesday incident, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told ICE agents to “get the f—k out” of the city. “We do not want you here,” he said. “Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety and you are doing exactly the opposite.”\n\n“They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,” Frey added. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”\n\nThe post Podcaster Jon Favreau Rips JD Vance Over Minneapolis ICE Shooting: ‘What the F—k Is Wrong With You?’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "The federal agent who shot and killed a driver in Minneapolis is an Iraq War veteran who has served for nearly two decades in the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nJonathan Ross, who shot and killed Renee Good on Wednesday, has served as a deportation officer with ICE since 2015, records show. He was seriously injured last summer when he was dragged by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect whom he shot with a stun gun.\n\nFederal officials have not named the officer who shot Good, a 37-year-old mother who was shot as she tried to drive away from federal agents. But Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent who shot Good had been dragged by a vehicle last June, and a department spokesperson confirmed Noem was referring to the Bloomington, Minnesota, case in which documents identified the injured officer as Ross.\n\nNoem and other Trump administration officials have defended the agent as an experienced law enforcement professional who followed his training and shot Good after he believed she was trying to run him or other agents over with her vehicle. Video has raised questions about whether the shooting was in self-defense, and the FBI is investigating the deadly use of force. Some protesters are demanding that Ross face criminal charges, and Minnesota authorities also want to investigate.\n\nAttempts to reach Ross, 43, at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not immediately successful.\n\nHere are some things to know about him:\n\nExperienced military and law enforcement officer\n\nIn courtroom testimony last month, Ross said he deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard. Ross said he served as a machine gunner on a gun truck as part of a combat patrol team.\n\nHe said he returned from Iraq in 2005, went to college and joined the Border Patrol in 2007 near El Paso, Texas. He worked there until 2015, serving as a field intelligence agent gathering and analyzing information on cartels and drug and human smuggling.\n\nRoss said he has served as a deportation officer based in Minnesota since he joined ICE in 2015. He is assigned to fugitive operations, seeking to arrest “higher value targets” in the ICE region that includes Minneapolis, he testified last month. He said that he was also a team leader with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\n“So I develop the targets, create a target package, surveillance, and then develop a plan to execute the arrest warrant,” he said.\n\nRoss said that he was also a firearms instructor, an active shooter instructor, a field intelligence officer and member of the SWAT team. He said that he attended the Border Patrol’s academy in New Mexico, where he learned to speak Spanish.\n\nRoss was a leader of a team of agents who went to arrest a man who was in the U.S. illegally in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington on June 17. Agents had gathered outside the home of the man, Roberto Munoz-Guatemala, who left in his car, according to court records.\n\nFBI agents activated emergency sirens and lights instructing him to pull over but he did not. Ross pulled his vehicle diagonally in front of Munoz-Guatemala to force him to stop.\n\nRoss and an FBI agent identified themselves as police and pointed guns at Munoz-Guatemala, who raised his hands. Ross then approached Munoz-Guatemala’s vehicle and ordered him to put it in park.\n\nRoss told the driver to lower his window all the way down and warned that he would break it if he did not. Ross used a device known as a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the rear driver’s side window and reached inside the car to unlock the driver’s door.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela drove off while Ross’ arm was caught in the vehicle and accelerated, dragging Ross down the street. Ross fired his Taser, striking Munoz-Guatemala with prongs in the head, face and shoulder.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was not incapacitated by the Taser, prosecutors said, and kept driving, taking Ross the length of a football field in 12 seconds. Ross was knocked free from the vehicle by force after Munoz-Guatemala drove onto a curb for a second time and back to the street.\n\nRoss’ right arm was bleeding, and an FBI agent applied a tourniquet. Eventually, he received dozens of stitches at a hospital. Prosecutors said he had “suffered multiple large cuts, and abrasions to his knee, elbow, and face.”\n\n“It was pretty excruciating pain,” Ross testified.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was bleeding from his injuries and had a woman call 911, saying that he was assaulted and didn’t know whether the person trying to stop him was an officer. He was arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\nA jury found Munoz-Guatemala guilty at a trial last month, finding he “should reasonably have known that Jonathan Ross was a law enforcement officer and not a private citizen attempting to assault him.”\n\nFederal officials defend the agent without identifying him\n\nVice President J.D. Vance praised the agent's service to the country Thursday without naming him, saying the ICE officer “deserves a debt of gratitude.”\n\n“This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America,” Vance said. “He’s been assaulted. He’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it.”\n\nDHS assistant Tricia McLaughlin declined to confirm the agent's identity Thursday, saying doing so would be dangerous for the safety of him and his family. But she noted that he had been selected for ICE’s special response team, which includes a 30-hour tryout and additional training on specialized skills such as breaching techniques, perimeter control, hostage rescue and firearms.\n\n“He acted according to his training,” she said. “This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.”",

    "title": "Google billionaire Larry Page copies the Jeff Bezos playbook, buying a $173 million Miami compound that will save him millions in taxes",
    "description": "Critics warned a wealth tax in California would lead to a billionaire exodus. Florida says come on in, the water's warm.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page has quietly—or loudly—joined the billionaire exodus from California, shifting businesses east and dropping about $173 million on two ultra-luxury waterfront mansions in Miami’s Coconut Grove in a move that looks strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos’ relocation playbook. The timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look downright Bezos-ian.​\n\nIn late December and early January, The Wall Street Journal reported, Page snapped up two neighboring estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove, paying roughly $101.5 million for one waterfront compound and $71.9 million for another in an off‑market deal, for a combined outlay of about $173.4 million. One of the homes, previously listed for $135 million, spans 13 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms and sits directly on the water, while the second, bought from heiress Sloan Lindemann Barnett and her husband Roger Barnett, nearly doubled in value in less than five years.​\n\nThe purchases plant Page squarely inside one of Miami’s most exclusive enclaves, long favored by global elites seeking privacy, water access, and low‑key luxury. Local brokers say his splashy entry is part of a broader surge of high‑net‑worth Californians scouting Coconut Grove and other South Florida neighborhoods as they hedge against looming tax changes while upgrading to trophy waterfront properties. The real-estate purchases double as both a luxury retreat and a massive tax‑savings vehicle, with Page the most prominent of California’s ultrawealthy choosing to leave as state lawmakers are targeting fortunes like his with an aggressive wealth‑tax push.\n\nBehind the real-estate headlines, Page has been methodically severing his financial and legal ties to California ahead of a proposed wealth tax that targets residents worth more than $1 billion. Regulatory filings show he has moved his family office and several investment and holding entities out of the state, Business Insider reported, reincorporating key vehicles in Delaware and listing new business addresses in Florida.​\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Page had been telling associates he was considering Florida specifically because of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a 5% annual levy on the worldwide assets of billionaires domiciled in California. If passed and applied retroactively to residents as of Jan. 1, 2026, analysts estimate the tax could cost Page—currently ranked as the world’s second‑richest person—well over $10 billion.\n\n​​Some Silicon Valley executives, notably Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, warned such an outcome was possible, saying in late December founders would have to sell off parts of their companies to pay for “fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.” California Rep. Ro Khanna responded to the Times‘ reporting that Page and Peter Thiel were looking to leave by flagging the story on X and saying, seemingly sarcastically in the style of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “I will miss them very much.”",

    "fullText": "Archaeologists working on the coast of Israel have uncovered a large port city which contains what experts say is the “most compelling physical proof yet” supporting the Bible, reported GB News.\n\nThe remarkable discovery was made in the former city of Caesarea Maritima, now an immense archaeological park which rests about 30 miles outside of present-day Tel Aviv. The city, constructed between 22 B.C. and 10 B.C. by King Herod, housed a massive harbor as well as aqueducts, a theater, and a public stadium, all of which remain today. Caesarea Maritima is mentioned several times in the Book of Acts, which paints the port city as a major hub of influence for early Roman politics and Christianity. Based upon the evidence found, it’s believed that early Christians lived and worshipped in Caesarea Maritima, which lines up with accounts in the New Testament.\n\nCaesarea Maritima is also named in the Bible as the location where the first non-Jewish believer in Christianity was baptized by the apostle Peter, an event which marked the spread of Christian belief beyond the Judaic community. It is also the city in which Paul the apostle was imprisoned and later tried before Roman officials, an event likewise described in the Book of Acts. After the city was abandoned in 1265, it lay untouched until archaeological excavations began in the 1950s.\n\nFound throughout the ancient city were detailed mosaics which quote Paul’s letters, including several inscriptions which are believed to be amongst the oldest in the New Testament. One of the mosaics features a quote from Romans 13:3 which reads: \"Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.\"\n\nThe site is also home to the fabled Pilates Stone, which was discovered during an excavation in 1961 and still bears an inscription announcing Pontius Pilate as the Roman governor of Judea. This discovery was the first concrete archaeological proof that Pontius Pilate, who in the Bible oversaw Jesus’ trial and execution, was a real historical figure. The partially visible inscription reads: \"To this Divine Augusti Tiberieum, Pontius Pilate, prefect of Judea, has dedicated this.\" It dates back to somewhere between 26 A.D. and 36 A.D., which directly aligns with the timeline described in the Bible. The original stone now rests iat the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, while a replica now occupies the space in Caesarea Maritima.\n\nArchaeologists also unearthed several never-before-found ancient structures, including a governor’s residence and a residence for other high-ranking government and military officials, known as a praetorium. The remarkable discoveries will soon be opened to the public as part of the vast expeditions at the Caesarea Maritima Archaeological Park.",

    "fullText": "Pablo Manríquez on X/MeidasTouch\n\nRep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI) shredded “idiot” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday for immediately accusing Renee Nicole Good of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nGood was killed on Thursday in Minneapolis by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross, who shot Good in the face as she attempted to drive away from another agent who had his hand on her door handle after he told her to get out of her SUV. Good was pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting was caught on video and posted on social media.\n\nShortly after the killing, Noem quickly blamed Good for her own death and accused her of engaging in terrorism against Ross and the other agents. Noem claimed that Good had attempted to “ram them with her vehicle.”\n\nA photo taken of Good’s vehicle after the shooting shows a bloodied airbag and stuffed animals for her six-year-old, whom she dropped off at school just before she was killed, in the glove compartment.\n\nPablo Manríquez of Migrant Insider caught up with Magaziner outside the Capitol on Thursday and asked for the lawmaker’s reaction to Noem’s comments.

Like, she went on TV before any of the facts were in. She made up this story on TV about ICE agents trying to dig their truck out of the snow or something, which was clearly false. Like she didn’t even realize that there was gonna be video of what happened when she went up and gave a false story.\n\nEverybody in the Trump administration lies, but she’s not even good at the lie, right? And we’ve seen that over and over again. So, you know, it would be ridiculous, it would be funny if it wasn’t so sad and tragic because actual people’s lives are being ruined and in some cases ended by the lawlessness of the administration. And, again, like, if they had just done what they said they would do and just focus on people with serious criminal records, no one would be complaining, but they can’t help themselves.\n\nAfter the shooting, President Donald Trump blamed Good for the shooting, calling her a “professional agitator.” Vice President JD Vance alleged she was a “deranged leftist.”\n\nThe post ‘Kristi Noem’s an Idiot’: Congressman Shreds DHS Secretary Who ‘Didn’t Even Realize That There Was Gonna Be Video’ of ICE Killing first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": ", \n Peter Brown\n , and \n Aron Garst\n on January 8, 2026 at 4:57PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nCall of Duty is a cultural touchpoint in gaming. It has held the title of most popular first-person shooter for years, in a genre filled with high-quality multiplayer games that have constantly gunned for the top spot. While major elements persist across titles, each game tends to introduce--or at least attempt to introduce--something new to the formula, as Activision bounces development duties between internal studios including Treyarch and Infinity Ward.\n\nThe series goes back to 2003 with the original Call of Duty fighting with Medal of Honor and Battlefield--two franchises that already had established reputations--for player attention. All three were set during World War II, and Call of Duty would continue down that path for both Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 3.\n\nAfter several games set in the most devastating international conflict the world has ever seen, the series went in a different direction with the release of the widely-acclaimed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. A gripping narrative, memorable characters, and fast-paced multiplayer gave fans a rush of adrenaline and the series reached a height it had never achieved before. The positive reception ensured a steady stream of modern- or future-set sequels, including multiple Call of Duty: Black-Ops and two more Modern Warfare (Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3) games in the years to come.\n\nCall of Duty moves in cycles, and it was in 2017 that Activision took the series back to World War II for Call of Duty: WWII. It was a return to form that seemed like the right move at the right time--a good way to shake up the flow of the previous 10 years. Following Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 in 2018--which abandoned a single-player campaign but introduced a series-first battle royale mode--the franchise rebooted the Modern Warfare series in 2019.\n\nActivision took potentially the biggest step forward for the franchise to date by launching a free-to-play battle royale standalone game called Warzone in 2020. That has gone on to become a massive success for the publisher, eclipsing the standard game by several metrics. The main series continued with annual releases, with Black Ops Cold War coming out alongside Warzone in 2020. We saw both parts of Activision's Call of Duty ecosystem intertwine, with Black Ops guns coming into Warzone and a map redesign themed around Cold War's 1980s setting.\n\nCall of Duty's reach is vast, and it has resonated with casual and hardcore players for a wide variety of reasons. We've collected GameSpot's Call of Duty reviews from over the years and compiled them here to illustrate the series' rise to prominence, and to provide a historical snapshot of each individual games' place in the process. But if there's a particular game that made you fall in (or out) of love with Call of Duty, shout it out in the comments below!\n\n\"Call of Duty is an all-around excellent game that confidently challenges, head-on, all the other WWII-themed shooters out there and comes out on top. When a game is outstanding, like this one is, some people invariably expect it to be something completely different from what's already available. That's not true of Call of Duty, which is directly comparable to Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and other such games. Yet, on its own merits, this game is executed extraordinarily well, and, therefore, can be wholeheartedly recommended not just to fans of other WWII-themed shooters but to anyone looking for a first-rate action game.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Overall, Call of Duty: Finest Hour is still a competent shooter, and those who enjoy World War II-based games will still have a good time with it. Had the feel of the weapons been a little better, and had the campaign been more consistently intense, Finest Hour could have been a much better game. As it is, though, it enters a market that becomes more and more competitive with each passing month. Judged against the standards of so many other quality first-person shooters, Finest Hour is difficult to wholeheartedly recommend.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Call of Duty 2 is just about everything you would hope for and expect from the sequel to one of the most successful World War II shooters of all time. Its varied campaign, excellent sound and gameplay design, and generally good AI make it a worthy successor to the original. At the same time, though, it's still a World War II shooter, and if you've grown weary of them, then Call of Duty 2's lack of new material might turn you away. It can also be murderous on your computer if you have modest hardware. What Call of Duty 2 does do well is nail down just about all aspects that define an ideal first-person shooter. If you liked the original and have been thirsting for more, Call of Duty 2 will definitely deliver that.\" [Read the review]\n\nOverall, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One is still a worthwhile first-person shooter. The game has made noticeable strides over the previous Call of Duty game on consoles with an interesting, but short, campaign. While the game has its moments, particularly with the turret shooting and vehicle portions, Big Red One still falls short of the standard the series set for itself on the PC because of pedestrian sound effects, poor AI, and a lack of intensity in the infantry combat. The multiplayer action on the Xbox and PS2 is also only serviceable, so it's worth a bullet point on the back of the box...and not much more. Unless you're a hardcore WWII game fanatic, Big Red One's probably only worth a rent.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"From start to finish, Call of Duty 3 is an intense experience and a great game. The visuals are fantastic and the sound is some of the best in any game to date. Though there's no question that Call of Duty 3 is every bit as good as its predecessor, and without question the multiplayer is vastly improved, none of the changes or additions to the single-player campaign significantly alter the way the game plays. If the Call of Duty series hasn't won you over previously, Call of Duty 3 isn't going to do much to change your mind. But for anyone else, Call of Duty 3 is a must-own.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Call of Duty: Roads to Victory isn't a terrible game--it's just unnecessary. While it may look like Call of Duty and for a while feel like Call of Duty, nearly all of the things that make the Call of Duty games so enjoyable are watered down or missing.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"COD 4 is available on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, and each version holds up admirably. The differences between the two console versions feel mostly negligible. Both systems deliver good frame rates and have good, easy-to-use multiplayer setups that most closely resemble Halo 2 and 3's party system and matchmaking playlists. The PC version of the game uses a more traditional server browser to get you into games. Both systems work just fine on their respective platforms. The PC version has the ability to run in a higher resolution, if you're equipped with a PC that can handle it, but it seems to scale quite well. You can also create servers that allow up to 32 players to play at once on the PC, as opposed to a limit of 18 in the console versions, but given the size of the multiplayer maps, putting 32 players in them makes things a little too crowded. Despite listing 1080p support on the back of the box, COD 4 appears to prefer 720p on the PlayStation 3. The only way to get it to run in 1080p is to tell your PS3 that your TV doesn't support 720p or 1080i, but the difference seems minor. Either way, you'd be hard-pressed to tell it apart from its Xbox 360 counterpart. And all versions control just fine, making the decision over which version to buy totally dependent on which controller you like the most.\n\nIt's a shame that the single-player is so brief, but you should only skip out on Call of Duty 4 if you're the sort of person who doesn't appreciate great first-person shooter multiplayer. The quality of the content in the campaign is totally top-shelf, and the multiplayer is some of the best around, making this a truly superb package.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"The bigger issue is the lack of any sort of online play. It'll take you roughly eight hours to finish the campaign, which you'll probably spread out over two or three play sessions just to give your eyes and hands ample rest. Beyond that, the multiplayer mode is restricted to four players who happen to be in the same room as you. There's a decent selection of environments while the layouts are well suited to the different deathmatch and capture-the-flag options, but realistically speaking, how likely are you to convince four of your friends to buy one DS game then arrange for everyone to get together to take advantage of its multiplayer mode? Not very likely. As such, the game's longevity stems mainly from its single-player campaign. That's Call of Duty 4 on the DS in a nutshell: intensely satisfying, but over in a day or two.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"By staying largely true to the formula that made Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare so successful, Call of Duty: World at War has ensured a proven level of technical quality, particularly in the multiplayer arena. On the other hand, one of Modern Warfare's strengths was its fresh approach, and by embracing a familiar setting and familiar mechanics, World at War achieves greatness but falls short of excellence. This is only a bad thing if you are expecting this game to top its benchmark predecessor. If, however, you are hoping for an exciting campaign, fun cooperative play, and engaging multiplayer action, then you'll find a lot to be happy about in World at War.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"All told, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Reflex Edition does right by the source material. The expertly scripted and intensely exciting campaign is just as entertaining as it was two years ago on other systems, and even the occasional lapses in visual fidelity and control precision can't keep it from being a must-play for Wii shooter fans. Though the multiplayer will feel familiar to World at War veterans, the modern guns, equipment, and perks will make it feel new again, and the expanded gameplay modes offer a lot more variety. Though there are a few hitches to deal with, the core excellence of this game shines through, giving Wii owners a great shooter to keep them entertained for months to come.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Fortunately, the action generally remains on the good side of hectic, and the stream of rewards is as satisfying as ever. Two new elements, title and emblem, are little graphics and titles that you earn through your match performance, and these range run the gamut from serious to totally goofy. While not exactly in keeping with the serious tone of the campaign, they add an amusing way to further customize your online presence. With a robust variety of playlists in which to ply your deadly trade, Modern Warfare 2's competitive multiplayer is the best in the series and one of the best available on consoles. The inelegant campaign plot may make you feel like you're just along for the ride, but it is such an intense, roaringly great ride that you will be glad just to have played it. The cooperative missions provide a uniquely fun angle on the action that rounds out the package superbly, making Modern Warfare 2 thoroughly entertaining, thoroughly rewarding, and thoroughly worth the wait.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"While it may not take the signature Call of Duty action to dizzying new heights, Black Ops is a thoroughly excellent game. New modes and mechanics give a jolt of energy to the lively competitive multiplayer, and the engrossing new campaign develops into one of the best in the series. Combat training allows anyone to enjoy the thrills of arena combat and the satisfaction of leveling up, and the opportunities for cooperative play, local competition, and community video creation provide even more outlets for entertainment. Call of Duty: Black Ops lives up to the top-notch pedigree that the series has earned, giving players an awesome new shooter to enjoy just in time for the holidays.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Modern Warfare 3 doesn't take any chances with the tried-and-true formula. At launch, even the matchmaking playlists feature standard fare, but the robust Private Match customization options let you tweak the standards to your liking (even offering some of Black Ops' more interesting modes) and hold the possibility of odd permutations to come. Whatever diversions or innovations may lie in Modern Warfare 3's future, the competitive multiplayer still offers the same sweet satisfaction you've come to expect from the series. This is some of the best online shooter action around, and with the daunting challenges of Spec Ops and the exciting, globe-trotting campaign, Modern Warfare 3 stands tall as another great descendant of the game that changed a generation.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Though zombies mode is stagnating, the rest of Black Ops II is lively, and it's great to see some shifting in the familiar structure. Developer Treyarch's storytelling prowess has once again resulted in an engaging, exciting campaign, and the addition of league play to the online multiplayer arena is an intriguing change that could reinvigorate the formula that has endured for so long. By reaching forward while remaining rooted in the things it does so well, Black Ops II offers a great shooter experience.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Crashes occur on a fairly regular basis, locking the system up. It's tough to stay connected to games, and even remaining hooked up to Wi-Fi can be a challenge. Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified is a massive disappointment that tarnishes this highly regarded franchise. What's more, this is a blown opportunity for the Vita to garner itself a headline game and franchise that could have really energized the system. Instead, we get a quick, forgettable knockoff cranked out simply to take advantage of the buzz around the Black Ops name.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"From an exuberant campaign full of spectacle and variety to the way Extinction's unpredictable aliens force you to use those targeting skills in entirely new ways, Ghosts strikes an excellent balance between the familiar and the novel. This is a game that's keenly aware of the series' strengths, but doesn't find itself beholden to them. No matter what standard you apply, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a terrific first-person shooter.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"The last time Call of Duty had “Warfare” in its subtitle, it led to a well-received trilogy that deftly transitioned the series away from a well-trodden global conflict to modern-day combat. If the settings of today have run their course just as World War II did years ago, Advanced Warfare makes for a convincing foundation of futuristic yet relatable combat that is worth exploring and expanding further. The huge change in player mobility is less of a paradigm shift and more of an overdue retooling for an 11-year-old FPS franchise, especially in a year of mobility-focused shooters. Yet for all its predictability, Advanced Warfare is a deluge of action-film bravado, and it's difficult to not be carried away by its tidal forces.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"There are fleeting moments when Black Ops III's cybernetic modifications change the way you play. These abilities let you control enemy drones, stun human opponents, or set fire to robots' internal systems. The powers would be more impactful, though, if there wasn't such a lack of enemy variety. Aside from flying drones and the occasional mech mini-boss, enemy variants just require differing numbers of bullets to take down. And when you're using them on such a repetitive group of targets, who react the same way every time, the abilities lose their novelty.\n\nAlthough Black Ops III offers the option to play the campaign cooperatively, its problems only multiply as a result. Instead of creating deeper scenarios involving teamwork and communication between up to four players, Black Ops III decides to just throw more hardened enemies at you. One Warlord--an enemy that requires several magazines to bring down--is bothersome enough. Four of them together is downright frustrating. They feel more like brick walls than sentient soldiers.\n\nBlack Ops III's narrative doesn't support the campaign in any meaningful way, either. It tells an incomprehensible story about AI ascendancy and the moral grays of a hyper-connected future, raising intriguing questions but never bothering to answer them. At the end of it all, after hours of soulless shooting and unremarkable storytelling, Black Ops III delivered its nebulous twist, and I didn't dwell on it.\n\nIn its undead modes, and the first 10 hours of multiplayer, it excels. But in its campaign, it merely crawls forward. Black Ops III doesn't offer anything remarkable to the series, but does just enough to maintain the Call of Duty status quo. The franchise, however slowly, continues its inexorable march.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"By venturing beyond Earth--and not just to other planets, but to space itself--Call of Duty found a canvas to produce its best story in years. It reinforces the notion that a game's narrative is only as good as its characters. Given the campaign's accomplishments in space combat, it's puzzling that no effort was made to replicate its zero-G sensations in Infinite Warfare's multiplayer. Consequently, the well-crafted Zombies mode is a more attractive, time-consuming proposition for those looking to play with friends. While no Call of Duty game has matched the comprehensive excellence of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the exploits of Reyes and Ethan are at least as memorable and moving as any deeds from “Soap” MacTavish and John Price during from the series' heyday.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Ultimately, if every shooter set in the European Theater of World War II is measured by how it depicts its D-Day landing--assuming it has such a mission--Call of Duty: WWII emphatically succeeds in its impactful designs and delivery. The sensation of riding the troop carrier as it approached the beach filled me with depression more than dread, knowing I'd survive eventually while many of my surrounding brothers in arms wouldn't. While not equally emotional, this battle's reinterpretation in War mode proves to be a highlight in a superb suite of competitive modes. Zombies rounds off this stellar return to form, effectively blending the ferocity of online cooperative play with the goal-driven satisfaction of found in the campaign. As one of the most comprehensive and filler-free Call of Dutys in recent memory, Call of Duty: WWII successfully capitalizes on the series' strengths\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Black Ops 4 isn't short on content, and its three main modes are substantial. Multiplayer introduces more tactical mechanics without forcing you into them, and it largely strikes a good balance. Zombies has multiple deep, secret-filled maps to explore, though its returning characters don't hold up and prove distracting. Finally, Blackout pushes Call of Duty in an entirely new direction, making use of aspects from both multiplayer and Zombies for a take on the battle royale genre that stands on its own. Sure, there isn't a traditional single-player campaign, but with the depth and breadth of what is there, Black Ops 4 doesn't need it.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Modern Warfare makes old observations and presents them with new flourishes. Those new flourishes do make for a good campaign and solid multiplayer. But it's when Modern Warfare asks you to think harder that it falls short. [Read the review]\n\n\"Warzone is a great sophomore attempt at a battle royale from Call of Duty, which finally manages to carve out its own identity with interesting spins on the existing formula. Its subversion of death and the nail-biting Gulag duels give you more ways to stay in a match, while also forcing you to be aware of your surroundings even after wiping a rival squad. Its looting is streamlined enough to make early moments feel fast, but Warzone also loses some of the messy magic from hobbled together loadouts by letting you drop in prebuilt ones far too easily and frequently. Still, if you're comfortable with Call of Duty's latest iteration of multiplayer antics and thrive in the stressful setting of battle royales, Warzone is a strong contender for your attention.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"As with any annual game franchise, it's hard not to compare Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War to last year's Modern Warfare. On the campaign side, Cold War does much better than last year's outing, showing that Call of Duty fares far better when it errs on the side of fantasy. This is true within Cold War's campaign, where the inclusion of Ronald Reagan is a bizarre fit for an otherwise larger-than-life story about espionage and brainwashing, and it's true when comparing its story to that of last year's self-serious Modern Warfare.\n\nIn Zombies, Cold War has a far more successful co-op mode than Modern Warfare's Spec Ops, though it's still in need of some balance tweaks. Multiplayer, however, is where Cold War struggles; it falls flat overall, and that's especially apparent in Warzone's shadow.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"The thing about Call of Duty games is that, with each yearly iteration, you pretty much know what you're getting--and that's largely the case here. It's both a blessing and a curse for Vanguard, however. Elements of Vanguard feel like good additions to the franchise, but its ideas also don't always mix well with the series' framework. That framework is still strong, and the solid gunplay, exciting multiplayer, and inventive moments of the campaign are worth seeking out. But forcing those two parts together exposes the seams in Call of Duty: Vanguard at times, weakening both parts of the game rather than pushing either one to the forefront.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Modern Warfare 2's gunplay and the fast time-to-kill all feel very much the same as Modern Warfare 2019. However, Infinity Ward definitely improved a lot on what worked and didn't work in the previous game. The scaled-back maps definitely make for better pacing, the less hectic movement is not so overwhelming, and all the new maneuverability features make the game so enjoyable from match to match. No one should load into a match expecting this game to be anything like the original Modern Warfare 2, but all issues aside, this rebooted version's gameplay does serve as a positive successor to Modern Warfare 2019.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Although its narrative setup is enjoyable, Modern Warfare 3 can't get out of its own way, with nearly half of the missions being the underwhelming Open Combat style. The bumpy pacing and abrupt ending make Makarov's big return a disappointment, dragging Modern Warfare 3 down as the weakest entry of an otherwise strong reboot series.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Between Omni-movement, map design, and new options for loadouts, Black Ops 6 is full of relatively small adjustments that fit well with the underlying Call of Duty formula, without drastically changing it. Those adjustments often do tend to favor one kind of play over others--the bunny hopping, dolphin diving, in-your-face aggressive approach--but that's not necessarily always a bad thing, and playing with Black Ops 6's new movement system makes for some phenomenal action moments and great-feeling gunfights. The effects of Omni-movement and smaller battlefields have a tendency to have a limiting effect on what works in Black Ops 6 multiplayer at times, but with well-built maps, quick traversal, intense weapons, and interesting loadout options and rewards, the things the game does well are still a whole lot of fun.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"One big change for Black Ops 7 is the reintroduction of classic matchmaking. This is the Call of Duty matchmaking formula present in the games that came before 2019's Modern Warfare reboot. This means open matchmaking with minimal skill consideration, whereas the recent games had strict skill-based matchmaking (or SBMM). This is something that a vocal portion of the community has been requesting to change in Call of Duty, but I don't think this is a positive for everyone. On one hand, I enjoy the classic matchmaking and the varied lobbies it provides. Some matches you get paired against really skilled opponents, and other times you're the better player. Call of Duty's strict SBMM of recent years made it difficult for players of various skill levels to play together. It also made some players feel punished for having a really good game, because the lobbies would seemingly increase in difficulty afterwards. On the other hand, I recognize there are players who might find the change jarring, if skill-based matchmaking was heavily protecting them. This is a big change for Call of Duty, and the impact of this remains to be seen.\n\n\"Overall, the multiplayer package is really strong in Black Ops 7. The movement is fun and fluid, the gunplay is as satisfying as ever, and the map designs greatly improve the experience from last year. Combined with the smaller quality-of-life change and the futuristic themes, Black Ops 7 feels like a fresh experience that avoids any dreaded fatigue.\" [Read the review]",

With a cast of four playable characters, each investigating a serial killer known as the Origami Killer, Heavy Rain's ambitious story can take many paths to multiple endings. The game's branching choices play out through slow-paced investigation scenes, interactions between characters, and intense action sequences navigated mostly through quick-time events--with potentially fatal outcomes for the characters if a key button press is missed. The game has multiple different endings for each character both bad and good, and the outcome of the central investigation also hinges on the player's actions. Initially released for the PS3, Heavy Rain has since been re-released for the PS4 (bundled with its successor Beyond: Two Souls) and also ported to PC.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fanatical.\n\nReleased in Telltale's heyday, The Walking Dead is easily one of the studio's best games. An episodic narrative game based on the comic book series of the same name, The Walking Dead sees players navigating the zombie apocalypse in the role of Lee Everett, a convicted criminal who finds himself looking after a young girl named Clementine. Unlike the majority of video games themed around zombies, The Walking Dead focuses more on the human element of its post-apocalyptic world, with interactions between characters often vital for survival. The game's action scenes are mostly handled through quick-time events in lieu of combat mechanics.\n\nA studio-defining title, Until Dawn was a breakout hit for Supermassive games, telling a trope-twisting teen horror story with many possible outcomes through its “butterfly effect” mechanic. The game follows eight teens on a trip to a mountain lodge, one year after two of their friends went missing on a similar trip. Each of the eight teens is playable at some point, and the choices the player makes for them--or their skill at hitting quick-time events--will determine who survives until dawn. The game feels like an homage to classic teen horror films, with its characters subjected to some good old-fashioned teen bullying alongside Until Dawn's terrifying supernatural threats. Until Dawn was so successful at nailing the feeling of a teen horror movie that it ended up being adapted into an actual film--which even took inspiration from the game’s branching narrative.\n\nAnother iconic game in the genre, Life Is Strange puts its own spin on the concept of the butterfly effect with a protagonist who has the ability to rewind time--allowing players to go back and choose different options almost instantly. Protagonist Max Caulfield has to come to grips with this mysterious new power, while also navigating the complexities high school life, and investigating a larger and darker mystery alongside childhood friend Chloe Price. The time-rewinding mechanic is used for puzzle-solving, and you'll also use exploration, item collecting, and branching dialogues with different characters to advance the story. Dontnod went on to make multiple games in the series, including a prequel Before the Storm and more recent direct sequel Double Exposure. Initially released as an episodic game, more recent re-releases have seen the Life is Strange collected and re-mastered.\n\nDon't let the RPG label put you off, Disco Elysium is far heavier on dialogue and player choices than it is on combat. Just like Detroit (and many other games in this list), Disco Elysium focuses on a detective who has been tasked with investigating a murder. The protagonist wakes up at the start of the game with amnesia, and it’s up to the player to then decide what kind of person he will be through a combination of dialogue choices and the game's unique skill tree. The isometric open-world game allows players to move through Elysium and interact with players and objects, with most other events resolved by skill checks based on dice rolls.\n\nAnother game from Detroit developer Quantic Dream, Beyond: Two Souls is critically polarizing, but still an interesting entry into a unique genre the studio pioneered. The game got a lot of attention for casting Hollywood stars in leading roles--Elliot Page played protagonist Jodie Holmes, and Willem Dafoe appeared as Jodie's father figure Nathan Dawkins. While most of its gameplay follows the classic Quantic Dream formula, Beyond shook things up through the addition of Aiden, an incorporeal soul linked to Jodie through a psychic tether. The player can choose to control Aiden instead of Jodie at times--or the game can be played in a multiplayer mode with a second player controlling Aiden. Unlike other Quantic Dream titles, Beyond: Two Souls only features one playable protagonist (not counting Aiden), and its narrative doesn’t branch quite as much, but players can still make a few major decisions, leading to various endings.\n\nThis gorgeous indie adventure game follows a group of teens who accidentally unleash a supernatural force on an overnight island trip. Players take control of protagonist Alex as she and her friends explore Edwards Island and try to unravel its mystery. The game's story is told entirely without cutscenes, with conversations happening as the characters walk through Oxenfree’s beautiful 2D environments. Alex can build and break relationships through these conversations, while using her handheld radio to solve puzzles and interact with the island's ghosts. Oxenfree has multiple possible outcomes for its teen characters, and several potential endings, as well as a new game plus mode that can further influence the story's outcome.\n\nA hard-boiled detective film in the form of a video game, L.A. Noire puts the player in the shoes of Detective Cole Phelps as he investigates crimes in 1947 Los Angeles. The game is split into various cases for the player to investigate, with an overarching conspiracy to be uncovered along the way. Each of the cases can be resolved with varying degrees of success depending on how much evidence the player manages to uncover. The game made big use of motion capture to animate the facial expressions of witnesses and suspects, allowing the player to pass judgement on who is lying and who is telling the truth. L.A. Noire is more action-oriented than others in the genre, involving combat with handguns and melee weapons, as well as action-packed chase scenes both on foot and in vehicles.\n\nThis reboot of the classic Sierra point-and-click adventure series was released episodically between 2015 and 2016, charting King Graham's rise to the throne and various adventures throughout his life. In King's Quest, players take control of Graham to explore different locations, solve puzzles, and investigate mysteries. Events both major and minor can be handled with three different approaches--bravery, wisdom, or compassion--with a player's choices throughout the game influencing what kind of person King Graham becomes. While the story is more linear than others in this list, the player still gets to make a handful of major choices that will influence how King's Quest plays out.\n\nA spiritual successor to Until Dawn, The Quarry is Supermassive's return to cliche teen horror, this time taking on the trope of a summer camp haunted by an unknown evil. The Quarry has nine playable characters, who can all live or die depending on the player's choices and skills throughout the game. Though its gameplay is mostly similar to Until Dawn, The Quarry features a multiplayer option where each character can be assigned to different player to control--potentially endangering or dooming their friends through their actions.\n\nIn Road 96, a group of teenagers attempt to flee the fictional authoritarian nation of Petria. The outcome of the story, and the fate of each of Road 96's playable characters, is affected by the decisions the player makes throughout the game. Each playthrough involves multiple characters--once one of the teens has either succeeded or failed to cross the border out of Petria, the player returns to the start of a different character's journey, with Road 96's finale taking place on Petria's tumultuous election day. The various encounters characters have along the road are procedurally generated, and there are multiple different ways to travel--catching buses, stealing cars, hitchhiking, hailing taxis, or simply walking. Like other games with branching narratives, Road 96 is designed to be played through multiple times, with each playthrough taking a different path to a different end.\n\nThe predecessor to Heavy Rain, this early Quantic Dream title was released as Fahrenheit outside the USA, where it was renamed Indigo Prophecy, and tells the story of a supernaturally possessed serial killer and the two detectives on his trail. Fahrenheit introduced concepts and features that would become fundamental to Quantic Dream's distinctive style of game, including the idea of a changing and evolving narrative based on character choices, and a focus on characters' journeys and mental states over combat or action elements. While Quantic Dreams' more recent games have definitely refined the formula, the original is still well worth a look.\n\nThis interactive narrative game was helmed by a developer who previously worked on Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls at Quantic Dream, and plenty of the studio's character-forward, narrative-heavy signature can be seen in As Dusk Falls. The game sees two very different families collide in the small desert town of Two Rock, Arizona following a car accident. Players guide multiple characters through a tense, ever-escalating confrontation between the families that spans two time periods. As Dusk Falls takes a democratic approach to multiplayer, allowing up to eight players to vote on what action should be taken next, with online, offline, and cross-platform multiplayer options available. Each player can also use a limited number of overrides, which will ensure that their option is picked.\n\nA niche third-person shooter from the creator of the Yakuza series, Binary Domain's story of a robot uprising and its interrogation of the personhood of humanoid androids covers very similar story beats to Detroit: Become Human. While its combat-heavy gameplay sets it apart from most of the games on this list, Binary Domain also features a unique \"consequence system\" that has the potential to change elements of the gameplay, story, and even the ending the player will experience. The consequence system tracks how the eight-person Rust Crew feels about player-character Dan Marshall, with the character interactions becoming just as important to Binary Domain as its combat. The game even has an android squadmate, exploring the sometimes uneasy relationship between man and machine.\n\nAnother title from Telltale's golden age, The Wolf Among Us was one of the narrative-focused studio's biggest hits. Based on the Fables comic series, The Wolf Among Us follows Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of Fabletown, as he investigates a series of strange murders. The gameplay involves investigating scenes and objects, talking to other characters in branching dialogue trees, and navigating action scenes through quick-time events. The game's dialogue choices run on a timer, forcing players to make quick decisions or let the timer run out and say nothing at all. The Wolf Among Us initially released in five episodes, but has since been collected into a single game and ported to a bunch of different platforms.\n\nJust like Detroit, Nobody Wants To Die sees the player take on the role of detective in a futuristic world, where technology can be used to analyse exactly what happened at the scene of a crime. The game is set in a world where human consciousness can be stored like data and switched between bodies, effectively extending the human lifespan indefinitely. The player character is James Karra, a detective on the trail of a serial killer who appears to be targeting the elites of the game’s futuristic vision of New York City. The branching narrative game features multiple endings based on the player's choices, with gameplay mostly consisting of investigating crime scenes and interrogating witnesses and other NPCs.\n\nOriginally conceived as a follow-up to Remedy's Alan Wake, Quantum Break instead ended up its own unique beast, featuring a time-manipulating protagonist and a future-sighted antagonist. One of the more action-oriented games on this list, protagonist Jack Joyce uses his time abilities to take on enemies in combat, but he can also use those abilities to investigate scenes and even replay past events. While many of the games on this list take inspiration from film and TV, Quantum Break takes that one step further by incorporating a live-action TV show into the game itself. Quantum Break is split up into five acts--at the end of each, the player is tasked with making a pivotal decision as antagonist Paul Serene, which is followed by an episode of the in-game TV show. Just like the game, the show has the potential to change based on the player's choices, with hidden scenes to unlock through multiple playthroughs.\n\nA new game from some of the developers behind the original Life is Strange, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is a two-part adventure game about a group of four girls during two different time periods--as teenagers in 1995, and reunited again 27 years later. Bloom & Rage is played entirely from the perspective of just one of the girls, Swann, who records events and subjects with her camcorder to be edited into her memoir. As adults, the group meets up to reminisce, at times struggling to remember what happened in the summer of 1995 that led them to part ways with no further contact. The events of the game will play out differently depending on what choices the characters make, and can even change depending on how much trust the player has managed to build with the other characters. Bloom & Rage is intended to be more than just a standalone game for Don't Nod, with more games being planned under the Lost Records label.\n\nWork as a superhero dispatcher in this workplace comedy-style game, where both your strategic choices and your relationships with your colleagues will impact how the narrative plays out. You play as Robert Robertson III, an employee of the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN) who is demoted from hero to dispatcher after his mecha suit is destroyed. Following in the footsteps of some of the classic narrative games of the 2010s, Dispatch is made up of eight episodes, initially released over a period of two months though they can now be played in full. Dispatch boasts an impressive voice cast including actors Aaron Paul and Jeffrey Wright, prominent gaming voice actors including Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey, influencers like Jacksepticeye and MoistCr1tikal, and even rapper Yung Gravy.\n\nSupermassive’s Dark Pictures Anthology is a series of narrative horror games--similar in tone and gameplay to its breakout hit Until Dawn, but smaller in scale. While the anthology’s games can be hit or miss, House Of Ashes is easily the strongest of the series so far and is worth a play for fans of Supermassive’s other games. Set during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the game features five playable characters--four of them members of the US Armed Forces, and one Iraqi Republican Guard. Finding themselves in a long-forgotten Akkadian temple beset by an ancient evil, the protagonists must put aside their allegiances to survive a deadlier supernatural threat. The third of a planned eight games in the Dark Pictures series, House of Ashes is the first in the anthology to start hinting at a bigger picture tying all of the ostensibly-unrelated games together.",

Adams also garnered interest from Michigan and James Madison.\n\nAdams made six appearances for Louisville this season. His lone start of the season was in Louisville’s 38-6 loss to SMU. In the defeat, Adams completed 12-of-his-17 pass attempts for 94 yards. He didn’t throw a touchdown or an interception.\n\nHe also recorded 14 yards in the outing.

    "description": "Here's everything Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud said ahead of Monday's wild-card round matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
    "fullText": "Here's everything Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud said ahead of Monday's wild-card round matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers, including his thoughts on facing T.J. Watt and more.\n\nQuestion: On if the playoff experience he’s gained helps him as he prepares for this postseason\n\nC.J. Stroud: “I'm excited. The experience that I've been able to gain in the last two years has been very important and helpful. But this is a new year, and I never played on the road in a Wild Card game, so there’s a new experience in that. But I have a good idea of how some of these games go and that's… You don't have an idea. It can go any way, and this is a good team we're playing against. So, I’m trying to be prepared in my preparation as much as I can.”\n\nQ: On if he gets a little more excited when you’re playing in these games at this time of year\n\nStroud: “Yes and no. I think when the ball is snapped, you're just locked in. But I think the added extra cameras, extra eyes and stuff, you know, there's a little more eyes on you. I'm excited and I've played in some big games in my career and… Every next one is a bigger one. I just want to be able to handle this moment as best as I can and be present and enjoy it.”\n\nQ: On if playoff football is different or if it feels different\n\nStroud: “No, I wouldn't say it feels different. I think the margins are smaller. I think success is winning if you can win. I think that's the biggest thing is to find a way to win.”\n\nStroud: “Yeah, I have a lot of faith in Ka’imi. I think he's done a great job for us this year.”\n\nQ: On how the offensive line has performed this year\n\nStroud: “I think they're doing amazing. I think a lot of guys have been in there. I think schematically, too, me trying to get the ball out as fast as possible and taking one if one is there. I thought we've all grown from Tytus [Howard] all the way down to me. I think the leadership in that room has grown. I think Cole [Popovich] has done an amazing job. He's hard on those guys. He yells, he cusses, he does everything that you think an offensive line coach should do. Those guys, they're, ‘Yes, sir,’ and ‘No, sir.’ They also don't back down when a challenge is presented. They're the heartbeat of our team. We go as far as they go.”\n\nQ: On building chemistry with other pass catchers, outside of WR Nico Collins, throughout the season\n\nStroud: “Yeah, it's helpful. I think our young guys have gotten a lot of experience. There's still a lot of things they need to learn. They have to learn fast now. I'm excited for that. But I think every year I've had great receivers. Now we're just a little healthier, which is dope. So, I'm excited. I think this will be a great challenge for us. They're really good in the back end and do a great job in different coverages. We got to be able to identify what we're seeing and all be on the same page and go from there.”\n\nQ: On what he’s seen from the Pittsburgh Steelers pass rush\n\nStroud: “They [the Pittsburgh Steelers] rush together. They're going to push the pocket and burn the edge. I think they do a great job even with their effort. They’re getting chips and things like that the whole game and they're still going very hard. I have a lot of respect for [Alex] Highsmith and [T.J.] Watt and their interior guys. I think their whole defensive line is the heartbeat of their team. Then you've got Patrick Queen, who's a dog and been a great player in this league for a long time. Then Jalen [Ramsey], leading the guys in the back end. I think, overall, they've done a really good job. They make it hard and they play really hard. It's going to be a challenge. Up front, I respect them to a high standard and how Mike [Tomlin] coaches those guys as well.”\n\nQ: On how the game changes from the regular season to the playoffs\n\nStroud: “I wouldn't say it changes. The margin of the execution is just smaller. The guys are on a little more. I won’t change my preparation. I'll do the same things that I've always done. Maybe a little more here and a little less there. But whatever I need to do to be prepared. No special sauce, no special ingredient, still football. I just got to go and execute at a high level.”\n\nQ: On Offensive Coordinator Nick Caley and what stands out about him\n\nStroud: “I think his ability to block out the noise and continue to go forward. I think everybody in this day, and age wants a microwave. They want to throw something in the microwave, let it heat up fast and be a new product. That's none of us. Football is an oven type of sport or whatever you use, a Crock-Pot, whatever any of y'all use. I think this team, we try to do our best to block out the noise and stay in our brotherhood and lean on one another. I thought he's done a great job of leaning on us, asking us what we like, even if it didn't work, like not running away from asking guys what they like and putting guys in a position to do what we need to do best. We're still working. We still got a ways to go. But I'm just proud of that guy. I think he's done a heck of a job of calling it, of being honest and… One thing I respect about ‘Cales’ is he doesn't point fingers. If he does, it's in the right way. It's not like blame game. It's like, ‘Hey, you can be better here because I know you can.’ He's uplifting and I have a lot of love for that guy. He's done a heck of a job for us this year.”\n\nOn if his willingness to use his legs increases in playoff games\n\n“I don't know. I just try to play as fast as I can. I think every game I try to use my legs if I need to. But sometimes it doesn't present. I've been getting spied lately. So, that's kind of cool. I haven't gotten spied in my career probably in a long time. But whatever the play presents. Whatever way you've got to get the job done, get it done.”\n\nQ: On if there was any challenge of when to use his legs after the concussion\n\nStroud: “No, I don't live in fear, at least I try not to. I think this game, if you think about getting hurt, you think about something happening, is when it usually happens. I try my best to play fast and protect myself as well, though.”\n\nQ: On if he recalls watching Pittsburgh Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers play and what it means to face him in the playoffs\n\nStroud: “I'm a big fan of Aaron. I love what he does. He's been a heck of a player. I think he's a top-three quarterback to ever touch a football. He's done some really cool things in the sport. His mechanics are through the roof. His ability to use his pronation on his wrist and how he flicks the ball is just dope. I'm a big fan of his. This will be, I think, my second time facing him. I'm a big fan of his. I'm not going to be rooting for him on Monday night, but I think he's a heck of a player and I have a lot of respect for him. He's done it for a long time and is even doing it at a high level at his age now in year 21 or whatever it is for him. A lot of respect for him.”\n\nStroud: “Higgins has grown a lot. I think he's somebody who has killed people with extra movement and throwing his head and doing all these different releases and stuff. But I think I told him he's so big, fast and strong, the quicker you get open, the better. Especially for me, you're not really running around against defensive backs, you're running routes against the defensive line. I think it's somewhere he's grown in a lot of areas. I think he's grown in the run game, wanting to go block. I think all that stuff helps him. But he's done a tremendous job for us and he's going to be a heck of a player in this league for a long time.”\n\nQ: On his mindset going into the playoffs this year as opposed to the first two seasons\n\nQ: On how the team can take the adversity they faced in the regular season and carry it over to the playoffs\n\nStroud: “I think we have a lot of experience in high-pressure moments, high-pressure games. It'll be an opportunity for us to do it again. I think it's a heck of an opportunity to play in a legendary stadium against a legendary coach, a legendary team. This is going to be a great challenge. We've got to be ready. It's going to be cold and it's going to be loud and it's going to be a lot of elements that are not for us but are against us. But we've been in this before. We've played plenty of cold games, plenty of loud games, been in silent operations. A lot of experience in a lot of different ways. I think that will pay off when we go up there on Monday night.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: What did Texans QB C.J. Stroud say before wild-card game vs. Steelers?",

    "description": "The Canadian Women’s National Team superstar goalkeeper will now head to NC Courage after her recent time with San Diego Wave.",
    "fullText": "Today, the North Carolina Courage announced that they have signed CANWNT goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan to a two-year, fully-guaranteed contract through the 2027 season.\n\n“I can’t wait to join the Courage and bring my family to North Carolina. This team’s soccer identity and tactical systems are so exciting and fit the way I like to play as well. I’m really looking forward to joining the team, getting to work on the field, and focusing on a great season this year,” said Sheridan.\n\nWidely considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world, Sheridan has consistently found herself with numerous accolades and awards. She was named to NWSL Best XI First Team in 2021 and 2022, and Second Team in 2023. The GK also took home Goalkeeper of the Year honors in 2022.\n\nIn nine seasons, she earned 42 clean sheets in 166 regular season appearances. With the San Diego Wave, she help guide them to the 2023 NWSL Shield and 2024 NWSL Challenge Cup.\n\n“We’re delighted to welcome Kailen Sheridan to the club. She is an elite goalkeeper with proven experience at the highest level, and her leadership, distribution and shot-stopping ability immediately raise the standard of our squad. Kailen brings a strong mentality and professionalism that will be invaluable both on and off the pitch, and we’re confident she will play a key role in helping us achieve our objectives moving forward,” said Courage Chief Soccer Officer Ceri Bowley.\n\nInternationally, she has 63 appearances for the Canada Women’s National Team. In 2020, with her country, won the 2020 Olympic Gold Medal. She has represented her country at two World Cups and Olympics.\n\nAfter the departure of Casey Murphy, goalkeeper became a priority for NC Courage. And now, the club just brought in one of the very best. North Carolina will be a team to watch in 2026 after narrowly missing the playoffs this past season.",

    "title": "Packers vs. Bears playoff preview: Who the edge in turnovers and situationally?",
    "description": "Playoff games often come down to winning the turnover battle and coming up big in the biggest situations. Who has the edge between Packers and Bears?",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers (9-7-1) are going on the road to play the Chicago Bears (11-6) in the NFC Wild Card Round on Saturday at Soldier Field. The rubber match between the two NFC North rivals will determine who goes to the NFC Divisional Round and who is headed for the offseason.\n\nFootball is a complicated game, but finding the reasons for winning individual matchups between teams each week is often a straightforward exercise. What wins games? Excellent quarterback play, winning the line of scrimmage, taking care of the football and taking it away, controlling the important situations and overcoming or taking advantage of the injury situation.\n\nSo, who has the edge in the turnover department and in the game's biggest situations?\n\nTakeaways: GB, 14 (26th) CHI, 33 (1st)\n\nInterceptions: GB, 7 (28th) CHI, 23 (1st)\n\nFumbles recovered: GB, 7 (17th) CHI, 10 (4th)\n\nGiveaways: GB, 13 (3rd) CHI, 11 (1st)\n\nInterceptions thrown: GB, 7 (1st) CHI, 7 (1st)\n\nFumbles lost: GB, 6 (6th) CHI, 4 (3rd)\n\nTurnover differential: GB, +1 (12th) CHI, +22 (1st)\n\nW-L when winning turnover battle: GB, 5-1 CHI, 10-1\n\nThird down % (offense): GB, 48.8 (2nd) CHI, 42.7 (7th)\n\nThird down % (defense): GB, 39.4 (14th) CHI, 40.8 (22nd)\n\nThird down passer rating: GB, 101.2 (3rd) CHI, 97.2 (9th)\n\nRed zone TD% (offense): GB, 57.6 (14th) CHI, 58.2 (12th)\n\nRed zone TD% (defense): GB, 59.6 (21st) CHI, 56.1 (15th)\n\nRed zone TD passes: GB, 18 (7th) CHI, 14 (15th)\n\nFourth down % (offense): GB, 56.0 (18th) CHI, 51.7 (21st)\n\nFourth down % (defense): GB, 55.6 (18th) CHI, 47.8 (8th)\n\nPoints off turnovers: GB, 16 (31st) CHI, 90 (2nd)\n\nHow important will turnovers and situational football be in the rubber match? The first matchup featured an interception in the red zone on fourth down. The rematch featured a fumble inside the 10-yard line and a game-tying touchdown pass in the red zone on fourth down, and the Bears were only in the game because the offense failed on five trips inside the 20.\n\nWhile the Packers appear to have some slight situational edges, especially on third down, the Bears will go into Saturday with massive advantages in the turnover department. Arguably no team has been more dependent on turnovers to win games this season than the Bears, who have a takeaway in 15 of 17 games and lead the league in takeaways and turnover differential this season.\n\nConsider all this: the Bears have multiple takeaways in nine games this season and are 9-0 in those games. When not generating at least two takeaways? The Bears are 2-6, including a Week 14 loss to the Packers and back-to-back losses to end the season. And when not getting any turnovers? The Bears are 0-2, with a 31-point loss and a 14-point loss.\n\nJordan Love and Caleb Williams have similar turnover-worthy play percentages in 2025. Both have been elite at avoiding the dangerous play, complicating the path for the Packers to generate a takeaway but also making life difficult on the turnover-dependent Bears. Both teams are averaging fewer than one giveaway a game in 2025.\n\nTurnovers have often killed the Packers. An interception in Cleveland helped spark the comeback. A fumble in Dallas set up a go-ahead touchdown before the half. A fumble in the red zone versus Carolina hurt late. An interception in Denver turned the game. A lost fumble in Chicago cost the Packers what could have been game-ending points. These are the moments Green Bay must avoid against the Bears on Saturday.\n\nThe red zone has been a telling area for the Packers all season. When they score touchdowns inside the 20, they are hard to beat. But several of Green Bay's worst losses this season have been a direct result of failures in the red zone, including the Week 16 loss in Chicago (0-for-5 scoring touchdowns). During a two-week stretch in Denver and Chicago, the Packers went 1-for-9. In what could be a high scoring but low possession contest, scoring in the red zone will be absolutely vital for both teams. The Packers know it. The Bears know it. The red zone is the X-factor on Saturday.\n\nThird down was a strength for Love throughout the 2025 season. He will push the ball past the sticks and aggressively make throws to convert (or attempt to convert) on third down. Defensively, the Packers were dominating on third down with Micah Parsons, but getting off the field has gotten more difficult without the closer disrupting quarterbacks and creating negative plays. At this point, neither team has the pass-rush to consistently dominate on third down. Love has been one of the NFL's best on third down, and Williams remains one of the NFL's most creative off-schedule playmakers regardless of down.\n\nOverall, the Bears' ability to take the ball away and win the turnover battle looks like an overwhelming factor in Chicago's favor. Can the Packers protect the ball and convert in the red zone? A lot of points are possible if Love doesn't have the turnover and the Packers get the job done inside the 20. But as the first two meetings showed, every single play in the game's biggest moments matter. The guess here is that we will be able to evaluate turnovers and situational football and easily identify the game's winner by the end of Saturday night.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Packers vs. Bears playoff preview: Who the edge in turnovers and situationally?",

Love it or hate it, it isn’t going anywhere—and every program in the country feels its impact.\n\nBut the portal also gives players the same flexibility coaches enjoy: the ability to leave when a better opportunity presents itself. On Thursday, former Texas A&M redshirt junior tight end Theo Melin Öhrström found exactly that, landing with an ACC‑bound program not too far from Aggieland.\n\nAccording to On3Sports’ Hayes Fawcett, Öhrström will join the SMU Mustangs for the 2026 season and is expected to arrive in Dallas with up to two years of eligibility remaining. The former four‑star prospect stayed through the coaching transition in College Station and continued to make steady progress, earning more snaps as his career unfolded. He was firmly in the mix to start for the Aggies in 2026, but ultimately opted for a fresh start.\n\nAt SMU, he’ll have a much clearer path as the main focus at the position and can serve as the veteran presence in a young tight end room next season.\n\nYou can see his announcement below.\n\nBREAKING: Texas A&M transfer TE Theo Melin Ohrstrom has Committed to SMU, he tells @On3Sports\n\nHe totaled 352 yards and 3 TDs in his time with the Aggieshttps://t.co/RlUbB6Fk7q pic.twitter.com/sYJsfYzlSk\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 8, 2026\n\nThe NCAA football transfer portal opened Jan. 2 and runs through Jan. 16.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions.

(We're told ownership wants to recommend that he be retained by the new head coach there.)\n\nIn previous seasons, the Cowboys would look at only a handful of candidates, rather than interviewing as many as possible.\n\nBut our own Mike Fisher has stated that having 10-15 coaching candidates come through and offer their thoughts on how your team can improve is invaluable. Even if you don't intend to hire them, pick their brains.\n\nWhy not get as much outside information on where your team can improve?\n\nLeonhard is the most accomplished of the three - and he's got a Schotty background.\n\nThe bad news on Daronte Jones? He's a Flores assistant ... which means you might not get Flores, who is seeking a head coaching job.\n\nThe bad news on Banda? Same thing as it relates to Schwartz.\n\nBut at least there is this: Cowboys Nation didn't want the franchise to sit on its hands in this coaching search and waste days while other top candidates get snapped up.\n\nAnd thankfully, Dallas is being proactive.",

    "fullText": "Switzerland loads Olympic roster with NHL talent for Milano Cortina originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympic Winter Games fast approaching, Team Switzerland has finally announced their roster.\n\nAs is the case with other rosters, this marks the first group of NHL players to represent Switzerland at the Olympics since 2014. Team Switzerland in particular will be seeking their first Olympic medal in quite some time; they last took home the bronze in 1948. Switzerland, which is in Group A, will first open play against Team France on Feb. 12 and then play Team Canada on Feb. 13 and Team Czechia on Feb. 15.\n\nTeam Switzerland is headlined by eight league players, including Nashville Predators defenseman Roman Josi and New Jersey Devils forward and team captain Nico Hischier.\n\nThree players in total on the Switzerland roster, including the previously mentioned Hischier, are from the Devils.\n\nAlongside Hischier, right-winger Timo Meier and blueliner Jonas Siegenthaler of New Jersey have also earned a spot on Team Switzerland.\n\nFrom the Predators, captain Josi boasts a Norris Trophy among his credentials in playing at Milano Cortina.\n\nRoman Josi is back on the world stage 🇨🇭\n\nCap will compete for Team Switzerland for a second time at the upcoming Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026! pic.twitter.com/mH9mHIHgLV\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) January 7, 2026\n\nGoaltender Akira Schmid of the Vegas Golden Knights also made the cut, with Leonardo Genoni also among the three Switzerland netminders after having helped the Swedes to win silver in 2024 and 2025 at the World Championships.\n\nLos Angeles Kings forward Kevin Fiala said Team Switzerland has a leg up at this year's Winter Olympics due to how familiar the players on the roster are with one another.\n\n“Oh, I know everybody,\" Fiala said to NHL.com. \"I know everybody from [the] World Championship. Obviously, some guys I know from back in the days when we were together playing when we were young, and some guys I got to know the last few World Championships. We’re a big family, tight family. We love each other. That’s why we had success in the World Championship, and we’re going to try to do the same thing in the Olympics.”\n\nWhile Switzerland is not opening play at the Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena as favorites, the red and white will certainly receive a much needed boost due to the return of NHL talent.\n\nMORE:NHL's newest team to host Avalanche in 2027 Winter Classic",

    "description": "BOOOOOOM! Utah defensive end John Henry Daley is transferring to Michigan Football! The All-American is considered a Top-10 player in the transfer portal:",
    "fullText": "The Wolverines just landed a huge target through the transfer portal, as former Utah defensive end John Henry Daley is transferring to Michigan to reunite with head coach Kyle Whittingham and edge coach Lewis Powell.\n\nBREAKING: Utah star transfer EDGE John Henry Daley has committed to Michigan, @PeteNakos reports〽️https://t.co/U31NaOwVgy pic.twitter.com/nqFLdW9LL4\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 9, 2026\n\nMichigan beat out Notre Dame and LSU — two places he also visited — as well as BYU in this portal recruitment.\n\nDaley was a three-star high school recruit in the 2021 recruiting class and, as a legacy recruit, chose to go to BYU. After a two-year mission trip with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Brazil, he got on campus and took a redshirt season in 2023 before entering the transfer portal that offseason and heading to Utah.\n\nAfter a minimal-impact 2024 season with the Utes — and only tallying seven total tackles and one sack his first two years in college — Daley had a breakout season this season that resulted in him being named a Second-Team All-American and a First-Team All-Big 12 performer. The 6-foot-4, 255-pounder racked up 48 total tackles, 17.5 tackles for loss, 11.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and one pass deflection in 11 games in 2025.\n\nUnfortunately, Daley’s season came to an abrupt halt when he suffered a non-contact lower-leg injury — reported as a ruptured Achilles — in the penultimate game of the regular season. While he may not be fully recovered by the time spring ball rolls around, he is expected to make a full recovery and be ready to go for the 2026 season.\n\nInjury be damned, Daley still graded out near the top of Pro Football Focus at his position this year. Daley earned a 92.4 overall grade, good for No. 5 at the edge spot in the country only behind David Bailey (Texas Tech, 93.6), Rueben Bain Jr. (Miami, 92.9), Michael Heldman (Central Michigan, 92.8) and Romello Height (Texas Tech, 92.6). Daley also had the second-best pass rush grade (93.7) in the country, just barely behind Bailey (93.9).\n\nWith Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham off to the NFL Draft, defensive end was one of the top needs for the Wolverines in the portal this winter. You can now consider that need checked, although I certainly wouldn’t turn down another edge rusher through the portal if they wanted in. Regardless of what happens next, landing Daley is a massive move for Whittingham and provides defensive coordinator Jay Hill with an instant impact player at a premium position.\n\nDaley — who is rated as the No. 4 overall player in the portal by On3, and the No. 49 overall player in the portal by 247Sports — will have two years of collegiate eligibility remaining. He’s the fifth player to transfer to Ann Arbor this winter, joining Pitt long snapper Nico Crawford, UNLV punter Cam Brown, Pitt kicker Trey Butkowski and Oklahoma running back Taylor Tatum.\n\nCheck out some of Daley’s best highlights at Utah in the video below.",

    "fullText": "For anyone who thought that Bo Bichette might take a shorter-term contract in free agency—think again. Insider Jon Heyman is reporting that the much-sought-after free agent is looking for a massive $300 million deal. While it seems highly unlikely he’ll get that from anyone, it sounds like two teams are intensifying talks with the infield All-Star.\n\nWhile his longtime team, the Toronto Blue Jays, continue their flirtation with top free agent Kyle Tucker, Bichette is now getting seriously wooed by both the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Phillies are meeting with Bo Bichette \"in the coming days\", per @MattGelb pic.twitter.com/3HhgtQHwUl\n\n— Talkin' Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) January 8, 2026\n\nA report from Philadelphia Phillies beat writer Matt Gelb reveals that the Phils will be meeting with Bichette in the next few days, likely on Monday.\n\nGelb reports that the team has done “extensive work on the various roster ripple effects of signing him.\n\n“The club’s interest in Bichette is legitimate, and if it results in a deal, it would likely require the team to move on from roster mainstays J.T. Realmuto and Alec Bohm.”\n\nBohm, the Phillies third baseman, just agreed Thursday to a $10.2 million contract for 2026. A trade of Bohm may be necessitated by a Bichette signing, both to free up his money, and to open up a spot in the infield.\n\nRealmuto’s return to Philly in free agency is somewhat in doubt. He’s been a two-time All-Star and a two-time Gold Glover behind the plate for the Phillies over the past seven years.\n\nAs for the Yankees, the Jays’ heated division rival is looking a lot more closely at Bichette as well. This comes as their talks with their own free agent Cody Bellinger have stagnated.\n\nYankees are taking a closer look at Bo Bichette as there's still \"a bit of a gap\" in negotiations with Cody Bellinger. @JonHeyman pic.twitter.com/sWOPNnF6qd\n\n— New York Post Sports (@nypostsports) January 8, 2026\n\nHeyman calls it an “interesting development” as the Yanks are now taking a closer look at Bichette due to the fact that there’s still “a bit of a gap” in their negotiations with Bellinger. The Yankees made a second offer to Belli in recent days. The two sides, however, remain apart.\n\nThe insider also reiterates that New York is listening to trade offers on second baseman Jazz Chisholm, which would open up a spot for Bichette. The lifetime shortstop played second during the World Series for Toronto.\n\nRumor Warns NY Mets Fans That Kyle Tucker Could Be Another Jason Bay\n\nNY Mets or LA Dodgers Could Soon Sign Kyle Tucker at Team-Friendly Price\n\n5 NY Yankees Options if They Soon Lose Cody Bellinger in Free Agency, Including Byron Buxton",

    "fullText": "Michigan football fans have been a little uneasy about the transfer portal, having lost a bunch of players (before getting most of the top players back) while not really adding many.\n\nThe Wolverines opened up by getting three special teams specialists -- longsnapper Nico Crawford, punter Cameron Brown, and kicker Trey Butkowski. They followed those up with a surprise running back commit, as Oklahoma's Taylor Tatum, the No. 1 RB in the 2024 class, ended up signing with the maize and blue on Thursday.\n\nBut the visits to Ann Arbor really started to pick up steam starting on Wednesday, and among those who made it to campus was former Utah edge rusher John Henry Daley. Daley is one of the top EDGEs in the portal and obviously has familiarity, having been coached by Kyle Whittingham and now-Michigan edge rusher coach Lewis Powell. He originally played at BYU before transferring to Utah, so he also has familiarity with Jay Hill through his time in Provo.\n\nThough he had made a bevy of visits (to LSU and Notre Dame), he opted to come to the Wolverines, making his commitment official.\n\nBREAKING: Utah star transfer EDGE John Henry Daley has committed to Michigan, @PeteNakos reports〽️https://t.co/U31NaOwVgy pic.twitter.com/nqFLdW9LL4\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 9, 2026\n\nAccording to PFF, Daley had the second-best grade of consistently playing edge rushers in all of 2025. He had a 93.7 grade and finished with 11.5 sacks and a win rate of 24.1% -- good for sixth in the country.\n\nThe Utah native has two years of eligibility remaining and should be a productive pickup for the maize and blue straight out of the gates. That is pending a lower-leg injury he sustained at the end of his career with the Utes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: Michigan football lands elite EDGE John Henry Daley in transfer portal",

    "description": "Trent and Cheryl Chambliss welcomed their son, Trinidad, in August 2002",
    "fullText": "Trent and Cheryl Chambliss share two sons, Tyler and Trinidad\n\nTrinidad's father also played college football for Grand Rapids Community College and coached the sport at the quarterback's high school\n\nThe football star maintained his tradition of praying with his mom before every game, even after he transferred to Ole Miss in 2025\n\nTrinidad Chambliss’ rapid rise from a backup Division II transfer to an Ole Miss starter has been nothing short of extraordinary. But his parents, Trent and Cheryl Chambliss, have worked to keep his meteoric ascent in perspective.\n\n“If you’re not having fun, then what’s the whole point?” Trent told the Daily Journal in October 2025. “But you can’t win every game. So therefore, how do you end up learning? How do you grow? … What do we do the next day? And what do we learn? What are they teaching us?”\n\nThe couple raised their two sons, Trinidad and his older brother, Tyler, in Grand Rapids, Mich. Trent is a high school administrator, while Cheryl, now retired, spent her career as a juvenile probation officer, per Yahoo! Sports. Trinidad's father introduced him to the sport and even coached football at his son's high school.\n\nThose early lessons followed the quarterback after he transferred from Division II Ferris State University to the University of Mississippi in 2025. Trinidad unexpectedly moved into the starting lineup after the starter quarterback was injured and has since helped the Rebels become a contender in the 2025 college football playoffs, per Grand Rapids Magazine. Trent and Cheryl have continued to be a constant presence at his games.\n\nHere's everything to know about Trinidad Chambliss' parents, Trent and Cheryl Chambliss.\n\nThough Cheryl and Trent grew up miles apart — she was born in New Jersey and he's from South Bend, Ind. — they eventually made their way to Grand Rapids, the Daily Journal reported. There, they met while practicing for a 3-on-3 basketball tournament and got to know each other more through their mutual friends.\n\nEventually, the couple tied the knot and went on to welcome two sons: Tyler and Trinidad.\n\nTrinidad seems to have inherited his love for football from his dad. Trent moved from his hometown to Grand Rapids to play football at Grand Rapids Community College. But unlike his son, Trent was an offensive lineman, per the Clarion Ledger.\n\nTrinidad's father went on to coach football at Forest Hills Northern, a local high school that Trinidad later attended. According to Grand Rapids Magazine, the future Ole Miss quarterback would play on the school's fields as a kid and starred on its football and basketball teams as a student.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Trent has worked at a number of schools in Michigan and has served as the assistant principal of Wyoming High School since 2022.\n\nAccording to the Daily Journal, Cheryl worked as a juvenile probation officer for 30 years before she retired. After saying goodbye to her decades-long career, she started working as a substitute teacher and as a receptionist for a mental health practice in Michigan.\n\n\"Cheryl’s extensive experience at the Juvenile Court has equipped her with a deep understanding of the human experience and the complexities individuals face,\" her bio reads. \"This insight allows her to address inquiries, provide information, and guide you through the process, ensuring that each person feels heard, supported, and well-informed.\"\n\nTrent and Cheryl share two sons, Tyler and Trinidad. Tyler was born first, followed by Trinidad on Aug. 24, 2002.\n\nThe couple told the Daily Journal in October 2025 that they agreed Cheryl would name their second child if they were a girl and Trent would if they were a boy. Though his wife claimed that Trinidad was named after the Spanish word for \"The Trinity,\" Trent argued that boxer Félix Trinidad inspired the moniker more.\n\n\"I kind of thought, ‘Man, this name Trinidad, boy, that sounds like a good name,’ ” he explained. “And then we ended up having the correlation of The Holy Trinity and the religious and spiritual connection, which made it even better.”\n\nTrent told the Daily Journal that his son has always been athletically gifted and \"could catch before he could walk.\" Trinidad was involved in a wide array of sports from an early age, and, according to Cheryl, he \"always had a ball in his hand.\"\n\nThough he also played soccer, baseball and basketball, Trinidad ultimately fell in love with football. Trent, who was coaching at the time, began teaching his son quarterback drills during his meetings when Trinidad was just 6 or 7 years old.\n\nHis parents recalled playfully hitting him with pool noodles during his progressions, a routine that eventually drew in a growing group of neighborhood kids for daily practices.\n\n\"Before you knew it, he had a whole team of kids, like you were watching a little Pee Wee practice or just a school team,” Cheryl told the Daily Journal. \"And Trinidad just absolutely loved it. It wasn’t something that he was forced to do, it wasn’t something that he begrudged. He thoroughly enjoyed it.”\n\nWhile Trinidad was playing at Ferris State, he would run to the fence during warmups to pray with his mother. The quarterback and his mom told the Clarion Ledger that they were able to continue their pre-game tradition even after he transferred to Ole Miss.\n\nAfter Chambliss runs out of the tunnels, he finds his mom in the stands and the two recite a prayer together.\n\n“It's been surreal and it's been amazing and we just feel it's such a blessing,\" Cheryl said, referring to her son's success at the university. \"It's been really great for people to see what we already knew about our son, that he has talent, that he has ability to lead.\"",

    "fullText": "Goodbye UFC Fight Pass, hello … VICE TV?\n\nAfter six years as an exclusive partner of UFC Fight Pass, Legacy Fighting Alliance (LFA) is moving on. The premier regional mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion has signed a new broadcast deal with VICE TV, which will air 25 LFA events in 2026.\n\nThe first card on its new platform will be LFA 224 on Fri., Jan. 16, 2026, in Prior Lake, Minnesota. The event will be headlined by Matt Adams vs. Arslan Bilalov for the vacant LFA Heavyweight title. One week later, LFA heads to Brazil for LFA 225 on Jan. 23, featuring an interim Flyweight title fight between Marcos Degli and Luis Aguiar.\n\n“We are excited to announce an exciting new partnership with VICE TV,” LFA CEO Ed Soares wrote in a press release. “The LFA’s mission has always been to showcase the sport’s top up-and-coming fighters in front of the widest audience possible. VICE has built a loyal audience that values authenticity and unfiltered, ground-level storytelling. Together, we will bring the untold stories of athletes shaping the future of the sport to a national television audience.”\n\nVICE TV has quietly expanded its footprint in combat sports over the past few years. The network debuted Dark Side of the Cage in early 2025 and currently airs BKB Bare Knuckle Boxing as well as PFL’s international events, signaling a broader push into fight programming.\n\nWhile some fans may question leaving UFC Fight Pass due to its established MMA audience, Soares believes the move will significantly increase LFA’s reach.\n\n“Before, UFC Fight Pass distributed our events worldwide through their platform,” Soares told Sherdog. “Now, we’re negotiating distribution in over 200 markets. In the U.S., VICE TV will bring LFA into 45 million homes. When you combine TV and streaming, we expect at least five times the audience.”\n\nIn markets without finalized broadcast partners — including Brazil — LFA events will stream on the promotion’s official YouTube channel.",

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Pete Nakos, Michigan defensive back Jayden Sanders plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal. Sanders is a former highly sought-after recruit but only spent one season in Ann Arbor with the Wolverines. He now hits the open market with a ton of potential and eligibility on his hands.\n\nPlaying time actually went to Sanders’ way early and often. He played in all 13 games for the Wolverines as a true freshman. A nice 23 tackles are on the stat sheet, as is one pass breakup. Michigan certainly thought they were getting a look at somebody who was going to be a major contributor in the future.\n\nSanders played high school football at Kilgore (TX), where he was a four-star prospect. He was the No. 176 overall recruit in the 2025 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.\n\nA few other local schools were after Sanders before Michigan wound up being his destination out of high school. Oklahoma State was another out-of-state program, while in-state Baylor wanted to sign the blue-chip defensive back. Another opportunity will officially present itself once Sanders pops up in the portal.\n\n“It’s been huge, man,” former Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore said of Sanders during the regular season. “I remember me and [defensive coordinator] Wink [Martindale], it was maybe the fifth or sixth day of training camp. Wink came up to me and was like, ‘That guy’s going to help us this year.’ I was like, ‘I think so.’ And it came to fruition.”\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

    "fullText": "The Wisconsin Badgers picked up a second quarterback in the transfer portal on Thursday, as Louisville Cardinals transfer Deuce Adams committed to the program after a visit, per ESPN’s Pete Thamel.\n\nAdams, a former three-star recruit in the Class of 2024, was a redshirt freshman at Louisville this past season, completing 15 of 21 passes for 112 yards as the Cardinals’ No. 2 quarterback behind senior Miller Moss.\n\nAdams started one game for Louisville this season, completing 12 of 17 passes for 94 yards in a 38-6 loss to the SMU Mustangs. He ultimately played in seven games across two seasons at Louisville. After entering the portal, the Texas native received interest from multiple programs, including the Michigan Wolverines and James Madison Dukes.\n\nHowever, those visits were scheduled after Adams’s trip to Madison on Thursday, and the redshirt freshman ultimately committed to Wisconsin on his visit. The Badgers had been interested in several younger quarterbacks as they sought a second addition in the transfer portal, including Kansas true freshman transfer David McComb, who had visited Madison earlier in the week.\n\nBut, with one spot available, Adams was the choice, committing to the program first. He becomes the fifth scholarship quarterback for the Badgers in 2025, joining Colton Joseph, Carter Smith, Danny O’Neil, and incoming freshman Ryan Hopkins.\n\nJoseph is the team’s projected starter after coming in from Old Dominion, where he was one of the country’s top dual-threat quarterbacks in 2025. Smith was the starter for Wisconsin’s final games of the season, and the Badgers were able to retain him after some conversations with the staff. He currently projects as Wisconsin’s No. 2 quarterback to start the year, with Danny O’Neil nursing his long-term injury.\n\nHopkins, a four-star recruit in the Class of 2026, will likely need some time to develop, so Adams currently slots in as the No. 3 quarterback with the chance to compete for the backup spot this season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter turning in one of the worst defensive performances in league history this season, the New York Jets are searching for a new defensive coordinator.\n\nNew York’s defense failed to record a single interception all year, marking the first time that has happened since the statistic began being tracked. Following the season, the Jets parted ways with Steve Wilks and have begun requesting interviews with potential replacements.\n\nMORE: Hear Stephen A. Smith's opinion on what Oregon QB Dante Moore should do after the CFP\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Jets have requested permission to interview Minnesota Vikings passing game coordinator and defensive backs coach Daronte Jones for their defensive coordinator opening. Jones is also scheduled to interview with the Dallas Cowboys for their defensive coordinator position.\n\nMinnesota’s defense finished among the top three units in the NFL this season, with only Houston and Seattle potentially outperforming them. However, Jones may choose to be patient as he weighs his options, particularly given uncertainty surrounding the Vikings’ defensive staff. Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores is reportedly a candidate for multiple head coaching vacancies, according to league insiders, which could create an opportunity for Jones to earn a larger role in Minnesota if Flores departs, or he could join Flores’ staff.\n\nMORE: Jets get major NFL Draft news amid Alabama QB Ty Simpson's decision\n\nStill, taking interviews elsewhere only strengthens Jones’ profile as a rising defensive coach.

    "fullText": "Tonight’s Fiesta Bowl between the Miami Hurricanes and the Ole Miss Rebels will feature several players the Seattle Seahawks could draft in 2026. There’s one name in particular to watch, and several others to know.\n\nMost likely for the Seahawks to draft is Miami edge rusher Akheem Mesidor. He put the nation on watch with a dominant performance in the Cotton Bowl, helping Miami upset the defending national champion Ohio State Buckeyes. He’s been easy to overlook with the naked eye this year while playing opposite potential top-10 pick Rueben Bain on the defensive line, but is finally getting the respect he deserves. On 29 pass rush reps in the game, he garnered 6 pressures and 2 sacks. Seamocks.com blogger Jared Stanger wrote about him as a potential fit within Mike Macdonald’s defense back in November, being his lone mid-round fit at the position. Macdonald loves high-motor edge players, as evidenced by the Seahawks’ signing of DeMarcus Lawrence, and advanced pass rushers, as shown with his willingness to retain Uchenna Nwosu. Mesidor is the top draft prospect for Seahawks fans to watch tonight, and likely for the team’s scouts, too.\n\nOther names on Miami to know include tackle Francis Mauigoa (probably goes too high for Seattle to have a chance), cornerbacks Keionte Scott (who had a pick-six against Ohio State) and Ethan O’Connor (former Washington State Cougar), safety Jakobe Thomas (excellent size and ball skills could be a fit in Seahawks defense), and wide receiver CJ Daniels (could be a good complement to receiving corps next season).\n\nI wrote about Rueben Bain earlier in the season, but his draft stock is sky-high and the Seahawks draft pick will be late. There has been some polarizing discussion about his arm length, since there hasn’t ever been a Pro Bowl-caliber NFL edge rusher with as short of arms as him. However, there also hasn’t ever been one in college with that lack of arm length. Bain is already an anomaly and is too dominant to overlook, but he’ll be polarizing among fans and league circles alike. Some teams who value length more will have him graded as a second-round pick, but enough teams will fall in love with him that he should still go in the top half of the first round.\n\nOle Miss’ isn’t as loaded for the 2026 draft, more towards 2027. Their possible Seahawks come late April include linebacker Suntarine Perkins (could be a Tyrice Knight-esque build should they decide to add depth), cornerback Antonio Kite (likely Day 3 cornerback), wide receivers De’Zhaun Stribling (another former WSU Cougar) and Cayden Lee (underrated receiver due to size with great hands and route-running technique), and edge rusher Princewill Umanmielen (brother Princely was drafted to the Carolina Panthers last year).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Potential 2026 Seahawks in CFP Semifinal between Miami and Ole Miss",

    "description": "The Cleveland Browns have interest in replacing Kevin Stefanski with the John Harbaugh, and the feeling may just be mutual",
    "fullText": "In a surprising move earlier this week, the Cleveland Browns' division rival, the Baltimore Ravens, made when they fired their head coach, John Harbaugh. He had been with the team for 18 seasons with an overall record of 193-124, including a Super Bowl win. Harbaugh has been one of the most consistent coaches in the NFL for a while, so parting ways with him is awfully risky for the Ravens; the grass isn't always greener on the other side.\n\nCleveland.com's Browns Insider Mary Kay Cabot is reporting that the Browns are \"definitely doing their diligence\" on Harbaugh and that you can expect Cleveland to be on his list of interviews when he starts interviewing next week. This would be a slam dunk for the Browns if they could bring in Harbaugh to replace Kevin Stefanski as the team's head coach.\n\nThe Browns are casting a wide net, trying to find the right head coach to finally turn things around consistently and make them legitimate contenders.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns could be desired destination of former Ravens HC John Harbaugh",

    "fullText": "Colts GM sends clear message about Daniel Jones' future in Indianapolis originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nQuarterback Daniel Jones’ future with the Indianapolis Colts will be a main topic of conversation this offseason.\n\nJones was having a very solid season for the Colts before suffering a torn Achilles in Week 14. Given that he was on the last year of his contract, the injury raised some serious questions regarding the future of the 28-year-old QB in Indianapolis. Did the Colts still think he could be their guy moving forward? Would they look to go in a different direction?\n\nColts general manager Chris Ballard answered some of those questions at his second-ending news conference, and his comments sure made it sound like the teams plans to bring him back.\n\n\"I'm looking at him both near and long [term],\" Ballard said of Jones. \"When you're chasing the quarterback all the time, it makes it very hard. Your margin for error really shrinks down. And I feel very good about Daniel Jones and where he's at, where he's going. Yes, he's got the Achilles. But I think Daniel Jones has got a really bright future here in Indianapolis.\"\n\nEven with the Achilles injury, Jones will likely have other suitors in free agency given the lack of quarterback depth in the class. However, he has recently indicated that he would like to remain in Indianapolis.\n\n\"I've enjoyed being here, working with the coaching staff here, the players,\" Jones said. \"I think it's a great organization and I've enjoyed being here. Obviously there's a business side to it and understand that, but I've really enjoyed being here around these people.\"\n\nJones also doesn't think that the injury will impact his availability for next season, no matter where he plays.\n\n\"But I expect to be ready to go by training camp,\" Jones said. \"We'll attack the process and make sure I'm ready to go.\"\n\nJones is headed for unrestricted free agency in March, but he could potentially come to an agreement on a new deal with the Colts before then.",

    "fullText": "CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Browns opened their head coach search on Thursday by interviewing defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz and offensive coordinator Tommy Rees.\n\nGeneral manager Andrew Berry had said he would consider both coordinators for the opening. The Browns fired Kevin Stefanski on Monday after six seasons and a 36-58 overall mark. Stefanski was a two-time AP NFL Coach of the Year, but Cleveland had a 8-26 mark the past two seasons.\n\nSchwartz, 59, has head coaching experience, leading the Detroit Lions from 2009 through 2013. He had a 29-52 overall record and led the Lions to the playoffs in 2011, three seasons after they were the first NFL team to go 0-16.\n\nSchwartz has been the architect of one of the league's top defenses the last three seasons. Cleveland led the league in total defense in 2023 and ranked fourth this season as Myles Garrett recorded 23 sacks and broke the NFL single-season record.\n\n“Jim’s an outstanding football coach. We have a lot of respect for him, a lot of appreciation for him, and he has certainly earned the right for consideration,” Berry said.\n\nSafety Grant Delpit and other defensive players are hoping Schwartz will remain, either as head coach or coordinator.\n\n“I think it goes without saying what kind of coach he is and the energy he brings. I think coach Schwartz is going to be a great, still-got-it type of head coach. He’s a fiery guy and I’d vouch for him,” Delpit said. “I think that he’s taken our defense and brought it to an elite level and kept it there.”\n\nRees came to Cleveland in 2024 as tight ends coach and pass game specialist before being promoted to offensive coordinator this season. He had play-calling responsibilities for the final nine games and was credited along with quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave for Shedeur Sanders' development during his seven games as the starter.\n\nRees was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Alabama in 2023 under Nick Saban after six seasons at Notre Dame. He was quarterbacks coach at his alma mater from 2017-22 and added offensive coordinator duties in 2020.\n\n“He’s a very talented young coordinator. He’s held in very high regard, not just in college football, but across the NFL,” Berry said.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "While wrestlers go to great lengths to condition their bodies, tidy up their appearance, and maintain their brand, wrestling itself is anything but pretty. WWE Women's EVOLVE Champion Kendal Grey learned that the hard way when a sharp knee strike to the face from reigning \"NXT\" Women's Champion Jacy Jayne sent the young upstart to the dentist. Other champions might have sent flowers to Grey's resting bed, but Jayne, instead, took to social media to welcome Grey to the lifestyle.\n\n\"Welcome to the biz kid,\" Jayne wrote simply.\n\nMidday Thursday, Jayne reposted and responded to Grey's tooth-related call-out post. In Grey's original post, the WWE EVOLVE Women's Champion posted a clip of the fateful knee to the jaw that sent her to the nearest dentist's office, and tagged Jayne's social media account in her caption. While the extent of Grey's tooth injury is unclear, the \"NXT\" upstart nevertheless promised to return the favor to Jayne in the future, prompting Jayne's snarky response. As of writing, Jayne's remark has surpassed nearly 8,000 views on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWelcome to the biz kid https://t.co/0Lk6AJk0ZF\n\n— Jacy Jayne (@jacyjaynewwe) January 8, 2026\n\nFans were vocal with support under Jayne's post, with a leading comment calling Jayne \"one of the best knee strikers in the game.\" Others praised Jayne for her dominant \"NXT\" run, while several netizens called Jayne \"mother,\" a term of endearment in queer and Gen Z online spaces. Grey has yet to respond to Jayne's comments.\n\nThe strike that sent Grey to the dentist's chair office comes from her \"NXT\" Women's Championship match at Tuesday's New Years Evil event, where she unsuccessfully challenged for Jayne's title in an contest full of vicious strikes, top-rope moves, and Fatal Influence interference. If rumors are true, however, Grey may not have long to score payback on Jayne, as rumors of a main roster call-up for the Fatal Influence leader run rampant.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

He’s spent the past two seasons with the Nittany Lions, appearing in five games as a true freshman in 2024 before appearing in all 13 games during the 2025 campaign.\n\nThis season, Gilliam began to have a more significant impact along the defensive front. He tallied 15 tackles, 2.0 tackles for a loss and 0.5 sacks. He started two games.\n\nPrior to enrolling at Penn State, Gilliam was ranked as a three-star prospect and the No. 741 overall recruit in the 2023 class, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking. He also checked in as the No. 63 defensive lineman in the class and the No. 25 overall player from the state of Maryland, hailing from Gaithersburg (MD) Quince Orchard.\n\nHe was rated as a four-star prospect in the On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings. He was the No. 67 overall recruit, and the No. 6 overall defensive lineman available after entering their name into the portal before committing to a new beginning.\n\nIn high school, Gilliam was a three-year letterman and had an outstanding senior campaign. His team finished with an 11-1 record and Gilliam earned first-team All-Metro honors as a result.\n\nFormer LSU offensive lineman Ory Williams has committed to Tennessee, via the NCAA Transfer Portal, according to On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Williams spent two seasons at LSU.\n\nWilliams made 12 appearances and two starts in the 2025 campaign for the Tigers. As a true freshman, Williams played in just one game before ultimately redshirting. He has three years of eligibility remaining.\n\nOry Williams played high school football at San Marcos (TX), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 460 overall player and No. 30 offensive tackle in the 2024 recruiting cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Rankings.\n\nWilliams only played two years of high school football and quickly rose up the national ranks. At 6-foot-8, 335 pounds, Williams boasts professional size. As of this report, he is the No. 38 offensive tackle in On3’s 2026 Transfer Portal Player Rankings.\n\nWilliams visited Tennessee on Sunday. The Texas native spoke highly of the Volunteers’ coaching staff following his visit.",

I’m Ron Minsky. It is my\ngreat pleasure to introduce Richard Eisenberg. Richard’s a senior\ncontributor to the Haskell ecosystem. He’s worked on Haskell’s type\nsystem in a lot of different ways over the last eight years. He’s on\nthe GHC Steering Committee. He’s the Chair of the Haskell\nFoundation. One might wonder, what’s he doing here? Well, it turns out\nRichard has joined Jane Street. He’s working on our Tools and\nCompilers team, and in particular, working on the team that works on\nthe front end of the OCaml compiler. So, thanks for joining me,\nRichard.\n\nSo, maybe a good place to start out with is to talk about your\nbackground. You’ve done all this exciting work in the Haskell\necosystem. Maybe tell us a little bit more about how you got involved\nin Haskell and what kind of work you’ve done there.\n\nYeah, sure. I first really encountered Haskell when I went back to\ngraduate school. I’d been a high school teacher for a little while and\nthen I thought, ‘oh, you know, it’s time to get a Ph.D. in programming\nlanguages,’ kind of, as you do.\n\nIn the process toward that, I discovered dependent types. I didn’t\nwanna just show up in grad school and not know anything. So I did some\nbackground reading and I discovered that, you know, these fancy type\nsystems have so much expressiveness, and so much of a way of being\nable to sort of define what it is that you’re programming before you\neven write a line of code, that you can just express your ideas so\nmuch more clearly and then get the compiler to check that you actually\ndid it correctly. This was just sort of, you know, my brain exploded\nwhen I learned about this.\n\nI feel like, you know, I kind of pretend to know something about\nprogramming languages on TV, but like, actually my academic background\nis distributed systems, not programming languages, and there’s lots of\ngaps in my knowledge. And so, I kinda don’t really know what dependent\ntypes are. Can you give a suitably beginner-friendly explanation of\nwhat dependent types are?\n\nSure. And I’m gonna start by avoiding the trap of trying to define the\nterm, ‘dependent type.’\n\nAnd instead, just sort of describe ‘a language with dependent types\nallows you to do this thing.’ And that thing is to essentially encode\na proof of correctness into your program such that every time you\ncompile your program, that proof is checked. And so you know—if you’ve\nset things up the right way—that your program does what you think it\ndoes. And so, I’ll give a concrete example.\n\nAnd that is, to imagine a sorting function. So normally we think of a\nsorting function, let’s just say, it’s a function from a list of\n‘ints’ to a list of ints, right? It takes this list of ints’ input,\nand then does some transformation, and then produces a list. But\nactually, that’s a very loose description of a sorting function. We\ncan do better than that.\n\nI wanna say that a sorting function takes in a list of ints, and it\nproduces a list of ints in, I’m gonna say, non-descending order\n(because maybe there’s duplicates, so I don’t want to say ‘ascending\norder’ because someone out there might say that’s wrong). So we get\nthis list out that’s in non-descending order. Okay, that’s closer, but\nthat’s still not quite right because maybe my function just always\nreturned to the empty list. That’s a list in non-descending order.\n\nSo instead, I really want to say that it’s a function that takes in a\nlist of ints, and returns a result that is in non-descending order,\nand is a permutation of the input list. And that’s a rather glorious\ntype that I can assign to a sorting function. But it accurately\ndescribes what that sorting function does.\n\nAnd then I can implement that in any number of ways, using any of the\ncommon sorting algorithms that you learn in computer science, and any\nof those different algorithms will meet that specification, and then,\nif I’ve encoded this, my compiler will check that my algorithm\nactually does sorting and doesn’t do some other thing. And so now,\nhaving sort of explained that, I can return back and actually say what\nI mean by ‘dependent type.’\n\nA dependent type is a type that can depend on some input that you give\ninto a function, essentially. So, in this case, the output of the\nfunction, not just a list of ints, but the output depends on the\ninput. The output must be a permutation of the input. And so, that’s\nthe dependent type.\n\nSo when I started grad school, then I saw Haskell, and here was a\nlanguage that had this fancy type system and had all this\nexpressiveness. Didn’t quite have dependent types, but it had a lot of\nthat stuff. That just got me excited. And then, through that I started\nworking with Stephanie Weirich at University of Pennsylvania. She was\ndoing a lot of Haskell work. She collaborated a bunch with Simon\nPeyton Jones, who then I started collaborating with, and things just\nsort of took off from there. It was a pretty fast introduction into\nthat world.\n\nI wanna go a little deeper on that. I feel like we’ve started with\nthe, like, ‘Well, of course I got a Ph.D. in PL and was interested in\ndependent types.’ Like, how do you even get there? Where does your\ninterest and background in programming languages come [from] in the\nfirst place?\n\nSo, once upon a time, I wanted to program. I don’t know why I wanted\nto program. I was too little to have that level of introspection.\n\nSo I guess, uh, I learned Basic when I was, I think, five\nsomehow. There was a friend of my parents that decided I should learn\nBasic and so that happened.\n\nBut I then got more into it, I guess, when I was in 7th grade, so this\nwas, probably I was 12 years old. And someone told me that Pascal was\na good language to learn. So, you know, I pleaded with my parents and\neventually they bought me the Pascal compiler ‘cause back in those\ndays, you actually had to pay for compilers. At least on, sort of—we\nhad a Macintosh. If I had some kind of Unix system, maybe it would’ve\nbeen different.\n\nWell, which Pascal compiler did you use?\n\nUm, THINK Pascal? Was that a thing?\n\nTHINK Pascal, so not Borland. I guess Borland was \nDOS side of the world.\n\nYeah, yeah. Borland, yes, Borland was for like, ‘real programmers.’\n\nSo I got this, and somewhere along the way, I had decided that every\npiece of software should be, like, if you read the instruction manual,\nthat should tell you everything you need to know about that piece of\nsoftware. I don’t know why I assumed that, but that was my starting\npoint. And so, it came with these two big books and most of the books\nwere just like on compiler flags and setting up projects and none of\nthis stuff about programming. At the end of one of the books was a\nsyntax reference with no glosses, no further information, just a\nsyntax reference using those, sort of, block and line diagrams to\nrepresent recursive loops in the syntax. And I was like, ‘Okay, well,\nif my assumption is that this book defines how to program, and this is\nthe only thing it has, then all the information must be here.’\n\nSo I just stared at these syntax diagrams probably for hours and\nhours. Like, ‘Okay, what does all of this mean?’ And then eventually\nsort of bootstrapped my way into learning how to program Pascal. And\nso, that being my first ‘real programming experience,’ somehow that\nbuilt the structures in my brain just around syntax and languages, and\nit kind of went from there.\n\nAnd then fast-forward 10 years or so, and I took a PL course as an\nundergrad from Norman Ramsey and it just lit me up. It was just like,\nthis is really cool stuff. I really enjoy this kind of thinking. And\nit turned out, I took that at the end of my senior year of undergrad,\nand so it was sort of too late to immediately go into grad school at\nthat point and I had this whole machine going toward high school\nteaching. So I did that for a while, but then I ended up returning.\n\nI love that your entrée into programming was, roughly speaking, a\ntraumatic experience with syntax. That seems… (laughs)\n\nBut it wasn’t traumatic. It was fantastic. Somehow, this was just what\nI needed. This was what my 12-year-old-self needed: big syntax blocks.\n\n(laughs) Okay. So, you went off, you got your Ph.D., you started\nworking on Haskell. Where did it go from there?\n\nWell, I was working on my Ph.D. It was basically, Stephanie and I had\nthis idea about how to encode dependent types, but it required some\nmore support from the Haskell compiler. And so, I was pleading [with]\nthe Haskell people to create this for me. And then, eventually Simon\njust wrote and said, ‘Why don’t you just do it?’ And that was a new\nconcept for me. I was like, ‘I could influence this language? Well,\nyou know, I’m just this random person.’\n\nBut between Stephanie and Simon mentoring me, I got to a point where I\ncould contribute and then it just grew from there. So, [I] did a bunch\nof that as a Ph.D. student. Then after leaving my Ph.D., I was a\nprofessor for a few years at Bryn Mawr College. What was great about\nthat experience was, they were open to the idea that open source\ncontributions were a form of publication, right? A lot of professors\nhave a lot of pressure to keep producing papers. That was definitely\nthere for me, too. But alongside papers, I couldn’t just do\nsoftware. But I could do, sort of, traditional scholarly publications\nand software. So that gave me a chance to continue my implementation\nwork, remain a part of this open source community, while still doing\nthe high-level scholarly research that I had been doing. So that was a\nreally nice part of it.\n\nIt turned out that, to my great surprise, that—well, this wasn’t to my\ngreat surprise—it turned out that this was a lot of work. That\nmaintaining a research program with a bunch of papers every year, and\ndoing these open source contributions, and teaching, there was just\nmore than could comfortably fit into one job, especially during term\ntime. And to my own surprise, I realized that the teaching part was\nthe part that maybe I could pause on. I had done that full-time as a\nhigh school teacher for eight years, now I was back doing it. It was\nfun, but I thought it was time to sort of push in a slightly different\ndirection.\n\nSo after a couple years at Bryn Mawr, I left to join Tweed which is a\nsoftware consultancy based in Paris. They do a ton of Haskell\nwork. And they hired me, basically just to continue my contributions\nin the Haskell space. So, I continued doing research there, continued\ncontributing to the compiler there. And, you know, after a few years\nof that, that was fun, and I got to a point where I was looking to be\npart of a cohesive team all working together, and realizing that after\nso many years just working in one language, I was really ready to see\nwhat things were like in a different space. And so the timing worked\nout really well when you, Ron, reached out to me and started the\ndiscussions that led to me joining Jane Street.\n\nRight. And often in these interviews, I’ll ask someone, like, ‘so how\ndid you get here?’ But actually, I was part of the dramatis personae\nof how you actually arrived.\n\nYou were the—the dramatis personae, yeah. (laughs)\n\n(laughs) Right, which is, at some point, I was like, ‘oh, it would be\nreally good if Richard worked here,’ and I started reaching out and\ntrying to convince you to come. Which took, it’s important, I\ncalculated, 11 months from (laughs) when I started.\n\nYeah, yeah. That’s right. I mean, you know, of course the story [of]\nme coming to Jane Street starts with you asking me, and me saying\n‘No.’\n\nAnd again, it was a matter of timing. I’ve been aware of Jane Street\nfor a long time, been sort of wondering what was happening over there,\nand somehow when you first reached out, it just wasn’t the right time\nfor me yet. And then the second time, it was sort of a better time. I\ncouldn’t even tell you why. It’s just, this is the way that life\nflows.\n\nBut, you know, one of the barriers which we’ve joked about is that I\ngrew up in the New York area and actually ended up going to high\nschool in New York and commuting from New Jersey. So every day I was\ngoing back and forth across the George Washington Bridge, and swore to\nmyself then that I would never commute to and from New York City. And\nalso just sort of had this negative vibe from the financial industry,\nand I was just like, ‘I don’t know. Like, I want to be creating\nsomething that other people use,’ right?\n\nBut actually, this is fantastic. I’m having great fun. Part of it is\nthat I’m working as part of this larger ecosystem. It’s not just a\nclosed thing where I’m only doing stuff that’s internal to Jane\nStreet. But instead, contributing to this open source ecosystem,\nworking on an open language, OCaml, and really continuing some of\nthese research trends that I started 10 years ago. Now that I’m here,\nit just all fits very naturally together.\n\nI feel like, in general, one of my takeaways is that there’s lots of\ninteresting work in lots of different places and the preconceptions\nyou have when you are young often (laughs) don’t work out over\ntime. So a thing you talked about earlier is a topic that I feel like\nI should know something about, but don’t. I like your first high-level\ndescription ‘cause it actually lines up with the very little bit I\nknow about dependent types.\n\nAnd there’s also something that’s always made me a little nervous\nabout them because a basic fact about proofs is—proofs seem pretty\nhard to construct. People go to great trouble to build automated\nproving systems where you have tactic libraries, like, little tiny\nprograms that you can run to, like, ‘try this way or try that way’ of\ncoming up with a proof of a thing. And it all sounds really hard and\nwhen you talk to people who do kind of theorem proving on large scale\nsoftware systems, it sounds like a pretty challenging operation where\nthis is kind of a lot of engineering work that just goes into just\nconstructing the proof. So I’m curious how you think of the\npracticalities of that? Like, how convenient can you make it? And if\nyou make it a deeply embedded part of the programming process, does\nthat work well with the other things you might wanna do? Does it\ninterfere with the ordinary process of programming? How do you see the\npragmatics of that working out?\n\nYeah, that’s a great question. And this is a question that doesn’t\nhave an answer yet. This is, I think, still something that the\nprogramming languages community is grappling with. I have my own\ntakes, but this is still sort of an open question out there.\n\nI think, first of all, that for a programming language to be\neffective, everything needs to be opt-in, right? If you have a\nlanguage that supports dependent types—and there’s a bunch out\nthere. So actually, OCaml’s module system is a dependent type\nsystem. It’s missing one or two key features that makes it really sort\nof go. But that definitely has aspects of dependent types in\nit. Haskell has aspects of dependent types.\n\nThere are other languages, Coq, Agda, Idris, Lean, these are the ones\nthat really have embraced dependent types. But in any of these\nlanguages, you don’t have to use these dependent types. You can just\nwrite a sorting function that is described as ‘a list of ints to a\nlist of ints.’ That’s fine. And I think that’s a key aspect of any\nkind of system that’s gonna be using this dependent types feature,\nbecause not everyone wants to prove everything all the time. As you\nsay, proofs are expensive. And so, what you need is, you need the\nability to only prove the parts that you think are worthwhile proving.\n\nSo let’s say we have an important part of the system that might be\neasy to get wrong that we want to prove something about. How do we do\nthat? Is that still worth it? And one thing to think about is, what’s\nyour cost-benefit analysis, right? If you do this proving, can you\nspend less time on testing? Can you spend less time on debugging? Can\nyou spend less time on catastrophic failure because you missed\nsomething when debugging?\n\nIt is a lot harder to do these programs with proofs. But sometimes,\nthat’s really worth it. It’s a matter of applying good taste, like it\nis everywhere in programming, right? Any programming language gives\nyou a ton of tools to work with, and it takes time and experience and\ntaste to figure out when it’s time to use which tools.\n\nRight. And I do really like that, kind of, pay-as-you-go kind of\nattitude of, like, you want some kind of base language that’s\nrelatively simple to work with, and then the ability to add on more\nfeatures that give you more power of various kinds, and not be forced\nto pay for that complexity constantly in everything you do. Which is,\nI think, actually a really hard thing to get right in the design—of\nlike, not having these more powerful features leak in and corrupt the\nrest of your experience within the language.\n\nThat’s right. It’s a very careful thing. And my push in Haskell has\nbeen to try to increase or add new features to help support dependent\ntypes, and there’s been a large community of people really excited for\nthis. And in my measurement, my biased measurement, a smaller\ncommunity of people who have been saying, ‘No, no, no. Don’t do this\nbecause it’s gonna make it impossible to write simple programs.’ And\nmany, many, many times, I’ve had to reassure people, ‘No, no. All\nthose simple programs will continue to exist, they’ll continue to\nwork. You can do what you want.’ But I also wanna give power to people\nwho want to use the fancy dependent types.\n\nGreat. Okay. So let’s leave Haskell and dependent types behind for the\nmoment because that’s not primarily what you’re working on here. Maybe\nyou can tell us, what are you working on here? Like, what is the\nmission that you are on here, working on OCaml?\n\nSo, I’ll start more broadly and then I’ll get narrower. My broad\nmission is my belief that type systems are a fantastic way to\nstructure thought and structure programs. So by being able to write\ndown what you intend to do before doing it, then you can check what\nyou’ve done, and you can also help formulate your thoughts. And when I\nsay, ‘write down what you intend to do before doing it,’ I mean, write\ndown a specification in types.\n\nThe flip side of that, is that it must be the case that you can do\nthat without paying a one-time cost. It’s gonna be problematic if you\nwant to write an efficient program, and yet, by defining your program\ncarefully ahead of time, now it’s no longer as efficient at\nruntime. This checking and this writing of a specification should all\nhappen at compile time. This should be happening in front of the\nprogrammer and not in front of any users. If any of those details leak\ninto user land by slowing your program down or somehow interfering\nwith the operation of your program, then there’s a misdesign in the\nlanguage.\n\nSo coming down to what I’m actually working on here at Jane Street, so\nthe feature I’m working on is something called unboxed types. There’s\nvarious different ways of characterizing it, but one way to do so is,\nit allows inlining of type definitions. So what we might want to have\nin our design is to have a structure that has four fields that\ndescribe some aspects of a trade. And then maybe we store that\nstructure in some larger structure, and maybe that’s stored in some\nlarger structure.\n\nWell, if you do that the naïve way in OCaml, every time you store one\nstructure inside of another, it’s stored by a pointer. And it means\nnow when I wanna access the price of this trade that’s all the way\ndown (it’s a nested structure) I have to follow this pointer, then\nthat pointer, then that pointer, then that pointer, each time I have a\ncache miss, each time I have to load into memory. This is really bad.\n\nRight. And this highlights a kind of basic fact about OCaml, that it\nhas a very fancy, at least on the scale of modern language that people\nmight use, a very fancy type system and a brutally simple memory\nrepresentation. OCaml’s internal implementation might have been like a\nScheme or Lisp written in the mid-‘60s or something, which is to say,\neverything looks like either some immediate value, it’s no bigger than\na word that fits in a register, or a heap-allocated value, which is\nlike one header word and then one full word for every slot inside of\nit, and we have all the fancy, like, type goo on top of it that you\nwant, but all of the physical representation looks just like that.\n\nExactly. Exactly. It means that we’re building this beautiful type\ndiscipline in our software to try to avoid errors, and try to express\nourselves, and try to communicate more clearly among developers—and\nwe’re paying for that at runtime! This is ridiculous. To me, every\ntime a type system feature slows down your program or otherwise\ninterferes is just a misdesign. And so, the fact that this is our\ncurrent state of play is problematic. The task I’m working on is\ncoming up with a new design for OCaml’s type system, or this aspect of\nOCaml’s type system, that allows us to have this rich type structure\nwithout paying for it at runtime.\n\nThat’s right. Although it’s not that you can pick a type structure\nthat’s kind of oblivious to the performance details, right? In some\nsense it’s the opposite. The idea of the unboxed type work and a lot\nof the work that we’re doing now is really about taking design\ndecisions that have to do with performance and making them explicit at\nthe level of types.\n\nYes, that’s right. Because you can’t, I mean, in the end, we need to\nexecute this somehow. There needs to be an execution model. And so, if\nwe try to ignore all of these execution details in the type system,\nthen there’s not gonna be a way of making it fast. And so, the work\nis, in some sense, taking some of these execution-oriented details,\nmaking them manifest in the type system, getting programmers the\nability to write types that take these into account, so that we can\nthen execute fast.\n\nRight. In some sense, I think of this as really being about enabling\nperformance engineering, right? There’s kind of two different lines of\npeople thinking about how to optimize programs via compilers. One is,\nyou make your compiler smarter so it can do more and optimize things\nfor you. So the user can write kind of an ordinary program that just\nreflects, ‘what do they want to achieve and what’s the logical\nstructure,’ and then the compiler will, like, do something good. And\nthen, the other direction is trying to give a lot of precise\nunderstanding to the programmer so they can know exactly what they’re\ndoing and they can optimize their program. And these are both\nimportant.\n\nBut, like, in some sense the scale of optimizations are very\ndifferent. Like, if you come up with a way of making your compiler\nfaster that, like, takes most user programs and makes them 20% faster,\nthat’s an enormous win. Like, that’s a shockingly good\noutcome. Whereas, if you give people good performance engineering\ntools, the idea that they can think hard about a particular program\nand make it five, or 10, or 100 times faster is like, in some sense,\ntotally normal. And so, there’s a kind of extra power of giving\nindividuals the ability to optimize. It obviously misses out on scope\nand there’s something great about being able to go and in one swell\nfoop (laughs) make 20 different, or 100 different, or all the\ndifferent programs faster. But you can’t get the same kind of order of\nmagnitude of improvements that you can get from giving one programmer\nthe ability to really carefully engineer their system.\n\nWell, there’s a real tension because what in the end we’re doing in\nprogramming languages is, we’re trying to find a way for humans to\ncommunicate precisely to computers. And we have at our disposal our\ntool, one of our tools is the fact that this is happening on a\ncomputer. So we can write computer programs to try to sort of help\ncover this distance, right?\n\nIn the early days, humans were just completely at a disadvantage and\nthe humans wrote in assembly code. And this was kind of terrible. And\nwe’ve come some way since then, and so now instead of writing sort of\ninstruction-by-instruction that’s gonna be executed by the processor,\nwe can write in a high-level language and have a compiler translate\nthat high-level language to something that the computer can\nexecute. Hopefully along the way, it can actually make that\nfaster. But sometimes, we’ve gotten ourselves sort of too\nhigh-level. If we abstract away too many of the details of execution,\nit’s exactly as you were saying. It means that the programmer can no\nlonger do the performance engineering. And so, we need to expose just\nenough to the programmer so that now there’s some more details that\nthey can think about. Now they can do that performance engineering.\n\nBut still, I think the burden sits on the compiler to take those few\nhints that the programmer gives to make blazingly fast code come out\nthe other end. And it’s just really about this interplay between how\nmany details do we wanna expose? Certainly not all the details because\nthat’s too hard for the programmer. But we need to expose some. And\nso, it’s about, over time, programming languages developing more and\nmore features that sort of figure out the right line and the right\nbalance between this desire for high-level languages, closer to human\nthought, and low-level details, easier to execute.\n\nSo, before when we were talking about dependent types, we were talking\nabout how it’s important to have this kind of pay-as-you-go\nphenomenon, like, it gets harder as you try and get more power. It\nfeels like the same kind of thing shows up here.\n\nSo, when you try and get more control over the shape of data in the\nway that you described, what are the trade-offs? And how do you think\nabout designing the language in such a way that you don’t have\nwhatever extra complexity is there infect everything that you do?\n\nWell, we have to be really careful. So, with unboxed types, one of the\nchallenges is gonna be that unboxed types interfere with\npolymorphism. So, in a language like OCaml, you can write a function,\nsay, that computes the length of a list. And that’s gonna work over a\nlist, no matter what the list contains. And so the way that we say\nthat, is that in the type of the length function, there’s a type\nvariable. We say that it’s an ‘alpha list’ where alpha can stand for\nany type that you might wanna put in there. Once we introduce unboxed\ntypes, that no longer works out. Some of these types won’t be suitable\nreplacements for alpha. And so it means that, by having these unboxed\ntypes in the system, now this really powerful feature of polymorphism\nbecomes constrained. And so, algorithms that people are used to being\nable to use everywhere, no longer work so well.\n\nSo one of the challenges that we have is, how can we recover that? How\ncan we still keep this nice feature of polymorphism and without having\nunboxed types interfere? And so, one of the things that we’re thinking\nabout doing is some amount of essentially what could become runtime\ncode generation. It comes down to building experience with the\nfeature. As we start understanding this language feature better, we’re\ngoing to create programs using these unboxed types, recognize areas in\nwhich the current programming paradigms that we engage in no longer\nwork, and then figure out ways around them. It’s this give and take as\nwe’re doing the language design.\n\nAnd just to focus in on this code generation thing for a second, the\nbasic issue here is that the way you make in OCaml today, separate\ncompilation of work, and make the ability to write a function in one\nplace and use it polymorphically on lots of different types is, again,\nyou’re just kind of taking advantage of this rock stupid memory\nrepresentation. Like, what’s a list? A list is a collection of\nheap-allocated values, every one has, like, two slots. One is a place\nto put the data and the other is a place to have a pointer to the next\nthing on the list. And when you iterate over it, that thing always has\nthe same shape, it always has the same number of bytes, and so you\ncould just write one piece of code that kind of uniformly walks over\nit. And what happens in the unboxed types world is, suddenly you want\nthe system to contemplate multiple different possible shapes of the\ndata. And so, kind of at a mechanical level, you need different\nmachine instructions in order to do the walking of the data structure,\ndepending on what that structure is.\n\nAnd so, that’s how you might end up with wanting code generations. The\nway to kind of claw back the polymorphism is to generate the\ncode. Maybe you can generate the extra code at compile time, maybe you\nhave to generate the extra code at runtime. But you somehow now have\nto generate code for multiple different scenarios that essentially\nrepresent different physical shapes of the data.\n\nExactly. And right now, our best thought is that this will happen at\ncompile time, that we’ll be able to figure out what code we need to\ngenerate at compile time. That will prevent a few programming idioms\nthat someone might potentially want. I don’t think anyone will ever\nwant those (laughs) idioms in practice so I think we’ll be able to get\naway with it. But it does mean we’re thinking carefully about this\ndesign and it’s a hard thing. I’m not aware of another language that’s\nreally tackled the problem in the way that we expect to tackle it over\nthe next few months.\n\nSo another language I think is interesting to compare to, in all of\nthis, is Rust.\n\nSo Rust is a language which tries really hard to do two things at the\nsame time which are not trivial to do at the same time. One is to give\nstronger sense of type safety so that you can write programs that\nyou’re confident aren’t going to crash, so you get lots of protection\nfrom bugs from the type system. And also give the user a lot of\ncontrol over low-level details over how memory is managed. And we’re\nessentially trying to push OCaml in some sense at that high level of\ndescription in the same direction.\n\nHow do you think the Rust approach differs from the approach you see\nus trying to take with OCaml?\n\nThis is a good comparison. This takes us a little bit away from\nunboxed types and polymorphism because I think the way that that\nappears in Rust is quite different. But the notion of this sort of\nfiner level of control is definitely accurate. But Rust gives up\nsomething really big to do what they do. They give up garbage\ncollection. Within Jane Street and generally in programming, I think a\nlot of the time garbage collection is fantastic, right? It allows us\nto program without worrying about these low-level details that for\nmost programs, we don’t need to.\n\nSo, for instance, when I’m writing the OCaml compiler—which is written\nin OCaml, of course—I do want it to be performant, but I don’t really\ncare about microsecond latency. And so, I’m happy to write my compiler\nin a way that allocates a bunch of memory and then when it’s done with\nthat memory, the garbage collector comes and gets rid of it. This is\nreally, really convenient. In Rust, we don’t have that. In Rust, we\nare forced to think about memory, allocation, and deallocation at\nevery point in time. And this gives us this fine level of control, but\nit comes at a real cost, and it means now we’re sort of fighting\nagainst this ‘pay-as-you-go principle’ that we were talking about\nearlier. In Rust, for memory, you don’t pay as you go. Everyone has to\npay all the time for Rust fine memory control. So we wanna keep the\nhigh-level, garbage-collected OCaml for most applications, and then\nwhen we really want to have this fine level of control, we wanna have\nthat, too.\n\nAnd so, some of the work that we’re doing is around adding that finer\nlevel of control, but just where we need it.\n\nSo, one thing I wonder is whether this pay-as-you-go principle really\napplies in general or whether it’s like itself a kind of trade-off? I\nthink, if you’d asked the question of like, ‘well we should think of\ntypes in general as pay-as-you-go.’ Maybe your baseline should be by\ndefault untyped, and then when you want some extra control, you should\nadd types to it and lock it down more.\n\nThat seems in principle reasonable. But all the languages that I’ve\ndealt with that have pay-as-you-go types or what you might call\ngradual type systems, actually inherit quite a lot of complexity and\nproblems from that choice. It’s often simpler and better, at least for\nsome kinds of problems, to have a uniform approach where you sort of\nfigure out what trade-offs you wanna do and you kind of apply those\ntrade-offs uniformly. And I think, at least from my perspective, the\nbase choice you make in a language like Haskell or OCaml of like,\n‘actually, even though it has some ups and downs, we’re just going to\nhave types everywhere and that’s just how it’s gonna be,’ I think is\nat least a reasonable place in the trade off space of designs.\n\nAnd I wonder if the same is true about this kind of thing about\npay-as-you-go control? Whereas, I can imagine for some kinds of\napplications, you would want the property that, ‘yeah, I am explicit\nabout memory everywhere. I kind of have a hard guarantee that anywhere\nI look I have all of this extra information.’ I don’t know. How do you\nthink about this question of where pay-as-you-go is the right way or\nthe wrong way to think about designing something?\n\nI think that’s a great question and I agree. I mean, pay-as-you-go\ntypes, people have wanted that for some time. It hasn’t ever really\nhappened. And, I mean, you could almost say that C++ and C have\npay-as-you-go types and that they have type systems, but the type\nsystems are sort of completely broken.\n\n(laughs) Pay-as-you-go but then what do you get? I like that.\n\nWell, right, but, I mean, just to clarify for our listeners. What I\nmean by ‘completely broken’ is that at any point in time in C and C++\nyou can just say, ‘Oh, ignore the type system. And I’m gonna just take\nthis thing and change its type to be something else.’ And the\nlanguages, you know, they take this stance of, trust the programmer,\nthat when the programmer decides to do this, that this is a good\nidea. But we lose the guarantees that one would want from a type\nsystem like that when you dereference a pointer that there’s actually\nsomething there when you dereference it.\n\nSo, getting back to memory control, I like the idea of pay-as-you-go\nthere, or maybe it’s not even pay-as-you-go as much as a language that\ncan have multiple different modes of use with very easy interop. In\nthat we can have a system where there’s not fine memory management,\nthat you just sort of use the current OCaml’s system of uniform memory\nrepresentation, and then another part where maybe this particular team\nor this particular file says, ‘No, no. Here I really want careful\nmemory management.’ This is a different kind of pay-as-you-go. It’s\nsort of at the file level or something like that, or the package\nlevel, I suppose. And then as long as one piece of code can easily\ncall the other, that also works well.\n\nWe also see this kind of idea coming out in polyglot systems where we\nactually have multiple languages all calling one another because maybe\nthis part of the system is easier to write in some language, that part\nof the system is easier to write in some other language. It’s all a\nway of, these sort of different approaches to attack the same problem\nthat we don’t wanna have all of this complexity. We want to sort of\nnarrow down what complexity we have, where.\n\nRight. So there’s almost a notion of different dialects within the\nsame language?\n\nWith a really high quality FFI that really captures all of the\nimportant details so you can kind of interoperate, right? In fact, the\nwork of polyglot stories are actually really challenging to\nengineers. There’s like, a ton—\n\n… of hard work. I mean, we’ve done a bunch of work trying to get the\nPython-OCaml interop story working just right. We’ve made good\nprogress there but it’s actually quite challenging. And I feel like\nthe work is quadratic in the number of different (laughs) languages\nthat you need to hook together ‘cause it’s often unique, weird issues\nthat come with every pairing of things that you wanna make all one to\nthe other.\n\nI think that’s right. And that’s one of the appeals of having one\nlanguage that maybe is flexible enough to operate in multiple\ndifferent modes. So, in particular, in our design for unboxed types,\nwe are planning to make a box operation explicit. And the box\noperation is going to be ‘the spot’ that allocates memory. And so,\nnormally, you’ll be able to get uses of this box operation for\nfree. Programmers won’t ever notice it, they won’t write it. It just,\nall the existing code will have all the boxes inserted. But it would\nbe really easy to imagine some kind of compiler setting that turns\nthat feature off. Meaning that every time you wanna allocate memory,\nyou have to explicitly ask for it.\n\nSo this doesn’t bring you all the way to Rust, in that there’s still a\ngarbage collector operating, you still don’t have to manually\ndeallocate memory. But if I wanna write a program that absolutely,\nwhere every allocation is known, we haven’t designed this out. Maybe\nwe’re gonna go there, maybe we’re not gonna go there. Nothing is for\ncertain. But it turned out that in our design, it just naturally fell\nout that we could just add this compiler flag that just turns off\nboxing and it would be super easy to implement and we could experiment\nto see how easy it is to work with.\n\nSo, here we’re talking about a lot of very ambitious changes to\nOCaml. One uncomfortable fact about all of this is, like, we don’t own\nOCaml, we are not the (laughs) primary upstream developers. Every time\nwe wanna make a change to OCaml, there’s a bunch of people who we have\nto convince that it’s a good change. So one of the things that you’re\nthinking about in particular is, the kind of relationship of the work\nthat we’re doing here and our connection to the larger OCaml\ncommunity. Say a little bit more about how you think about this whole\nprocess.\n\nSo, I wanna start by pushing back against ‘unfortunate fact.’ I don’t\nsee that as an unfortunate fact at all. So OCaml was born as a\nresearch project out of Inria in France and still is there. That’s\nsort of its beating heart. And we are really significant benefactors\nof that work that others have done, that others continue to do. And\nso, Jane Street has chosen to work in part of this open source\nlanguage community where we’re taking others’ ideas and we’re\ncontributing our ideas back.\n\nSo in this podcast and in our work, we have these grand ideas. ‘Oh,\nwe’re gonna add this to OCaml. We’re gonna do this, we’re gonna do\nthat. Of course, what I really mean is, we’re going to experiment with\nthis idea internally. And then as that experiment unfolds, as we gain\nexperience and become more sure that it’s a right—I shouldn’t say a\nright idea. There’s many right ideas. But as we gain more confidence\nin a particular design, we can then work with the rest of the OCaml\ncommunity to try to make this part of everyone’s OCaml and not just\nJane Street’s.\n\nAnd in that way, we’re giving back to that community. At the same\ntime, we’re continuing to reap rewards from other work happening in\nthat community. So the biggest example of which is the multicore\nsupport that’s coming in OCaml 5. Still gonna be some time before Jane\nStreet’s ready to upgrade to OCaml 5. But that was a huge pile of work\ndone mostly outside, or maybe entirely outside of Jane Street’s walls,\nand we benefit by being part of this open source ecosystem. And so, I\nthink that this is a really great place to be where we’re\nparticipating, we’re getting new input of technical content, like\nmulticore OCaml, as well as design ideas. And I’m even thinking of\nsomething just a few weeks ago where I found an infelicity in the\ncompiler, made an improvement, pushed that upstream, and then we got\nfresh ideas from folks outside of Jane Street’s walls about, ‘Here’s\nactually an even better way to do it,’ and that was great. And then we\ncould incorporate that here. Without being part of this open source\necosystem, we wouldn’t have gotten that insight and we would be poorer\nfor it.\n\nSo, in the Haskell world, you spent a lot of time working on exciting\nnew type system features for Haskell and now you’re doing, in\nsubstance, similar kinds of work here. But I think that work flow is\npretty different, right? I think then, in the Haskell world, it was\nlike the primary work and ideation and evaluation was all deeply\nintegrated from the beginning in the open source world. And here,\nwe’re doing this work where we’re still open source, still, you know,\nyou can go look at the results on GitHub. But we are mostly iterating\ninternally, and then, over time, as we gain experience, as we gain\nmore confidence that the things we’ve built are good ideas, working to\nsee what subsets of these we can get upstreamed. I’m curious how that\nhas changed your feeling about the work, how it changes the texture of\nthe work that you do?\n\nSo working within the context of Jane Street gives us a lot more\nopportunity for experimentation. So a real big challenge of doing\nlanguage design is that, by necessity, you come up with an idea and\nmaybe you think it’s a good idea and you experiment with it on a few\nsmall programs on your own machine or you get your friend to sort of\nexperiment. You bounce the idea. Maybe, you know, you’re even\nproactive and you convene a committee of experts on this idea and now\nyou have, you know, five people thinking really hard about this one\nidea and trying to come up with the absolute best design.\n\nBut then, once you come up with the design, if you’re just in an open\nsource environment—without the context of a place like Jane Street—you\ndevelop the idea, implement it, and release it, and then now you have\nthousands or hundreds of thousands of programmers using it, and maybe\nit was a bad idea. But by the time you discover that it was a bad\nidea, it’s a little bit too late because maybe you have 90,000\nprogrammers who think it’s a bad idea, but you have a thousand who\nthink it’s a fantastic idea and will be very, very, very upset if you\nbreak their programs by changing it. And now you’re in a bad way.\n\nAnd even the people who think it’s a bad idea, who would like to get\nrid of it, don’t necessarily want you to break their programs in the\ninterim before they’ve (laughs) stopped relying on the feature.\n\nThat’s right. And so, it’s really, really hard to make changes to a\nproper open source programming language. In the context of Jane Street\non the other hand, it’s—I don’t wanna say dead easy. There’s work\ninvolved, but it is tractable and somewhat easy in that we can develop\nan idea, push it out there, get other programmers in the firm to start\nusing it, and then as that happens, we can say, ‘Mm. This isn’t quite\nworking out the way that we thought it would.’ That, you know, theory\nmeets reality, and theory loses.\n\nAnd so, then we can make a change to the feature and we have sort of\nan operation that we use internally called a ‘tree smash,’ where some\nJane Street engineers work together to come up with a big diff that\nhappens to all of Jane Street’s code, all at once, and we can change\nthe spelling of a keyword if we want to. And in fact, we’re imagining\nthis now. So Jane Street has been working on a feature called ‘local\ntypes’ or ‘stack allocation.’ These two things are kind of the same\nthing. And we’re realizing that one aspect of the design was just a\nbit wrong. And there’s already a ton of code written using the old\ndesign, but we’ve invented a new keyword and a new place for the\nkeyword to appear, and all this stuff.\n\nAnd so, it’s gonna be some work to fix it, but there’s no part of us\nthat’s saying, ‘Oh no. Now we need to think about a migration plan and\nwe need to make sure that no one is too unhappy with this.’ We’re just\ngonna go do it. And so, it means by the time we get to upstreaming,\neverything is battle-tested. And so, it just increases the level of\nconfidence in the design when we go through that process.\n\nOne of the concerns I could see people having about this kind of\nprocess is, it’s going to do a lot of training on, ‘What are the\nrequirements within Jane Street?’ But there are all sorts of ways in\nwhich you could imagine the requirements in Jane Street and outside of\nJane Street being different. I’m curious how you think about the\ndesign process in a way where you end up with language features that\nare likely to be of quite general utility, ‘cause I think, in the end,\nthe only ones you’re gonna get accepted upstream are the ones that\npeople think are more broadly useful than just being useful for us.\n\nSo that’s indeed a challenge, right? It’s a challenge of overfitting,\nright? We have a very particular style of code within Jane Street and\na very particular use case that we’re working on. I think that is sort\nof a harder question to answer in some sense. I think one way that we\naddress that is by seeking outside feedback from the very\nbeginning. So, the plan that we have for unboxed types, another Jane\nStreet engineer, Stephen Dolan, he made a presentation about this\ndesign for unboxed types, I think in 2019. We’ve been thinking about\nthis for a long time. The local types and stack allocation feature,\nthis has also been featured in a number of presentations that we’ve\nmade to the OCaml community, out in public.\n\nAnd so, by incorporating that process early, we can get broad\nfeedback. That’s not the kind of feedback that tells us, ‘Oh, should\nthe keyword go here, or should it go there?’ Right? That’s the kind of\nthing that we develop internally. But I think that, by giving these\npresentations, by involving the broader community, even from the very\nbeginning, that helps to prevent some of this overfitting problem.\n\nSo, another interesting aspect of your background is, you’ve spent a\nlot of time, years really, working in the Haskell community and\nworking on Haskell. And now, you’re working on a totally new\nprogramming language using it both as the surface language in which\nyou write your programs, and also helping to design that language. I’m\ncurious, what struck you about difference? I’m curious, what are the\ndifferences that have struck you about Haskell and OCaml at multiple\ndifferent levels?\n\nIt’s been really fun over the past, I guess, six months now being part\nof these two language communities. So, I should say, I’m still quite\nactive in the Haskell world. I have not left the Haskell world. I’m\nliving both Haskell and OCaml on a daily basis. So let me think of a\ncouple of interesting points of comparison.\n\nSo, one is, it seems kind of simple, but actually I think it affects\nthe way that we program. The approach toward interfaces. In Haskell,\nyou tend to write your type signatures sort of right next to the\nfunction and Haskell uses a lot of type signatures. OCaml doesn’t so\nmuch. And so, OCaml there’s these separate interface files where you\ndefine the interface to your whole module, but it’s kind of apart and\nit means, in my experience, looking at a bunch of OCaml code. OCaml\ncode tends to be rather less documented than similar Haskell code, and\nI think that’s in part because in Haskell, you put your types right\nthere and that’s a form of documentation. And once you put your types\nin, then you can also put more documentation there and it becomes part\nof the habit of the Haskell programmer to put those comments right in\nthere.\n\nA flip side of this, is that Haskell has this feature called\ntypeclasses. And typeclasses allow you to use essentially one\nfunctioning to mean a variety of different things. OCaml doesn’t have\nthat feature. And so, what that can mean sometimes is that Haskell\ncode can become quite a bit harder to understand because if you have a\nbunch of these function names, any of which can mean a variety of\ndifferent things, all strung together, then it takes a lot of work on\nthe part of the reader to try to understand what on earth is going on\nthere. And that problem just doesn’t arise in OCaml. OCaml is much\nmore explicit about what operations it’s taking.\n\nSo maybe I can even, taking these two examples, generalize that a\nlittle bit and say, I find Haskell to be somewhat more explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time. Whereas, OCaml is somewhat more\nexplicit about what’s happening at runtime. So another place where\nthat comes into play is that, the Haskell compiler—and this connects\nwith a topic we were talking about earlier—the Haskell compiler\noptimizes much more aggressively than the OCaml one does. And that’s\nbecause in Haskell, Haskell’s a lazy language which means that if you\nsay, ‘Let X equal some big computation,’ we’re not gonna compute the\nbig computation until we need the value of X. In OCaml, if you say,\n‘Let X equal a big computation,’ we just compute that thing right\naway.\n\nAnd so, that means, on the one hand you might say, ‘Oh, well maybe\nHaskell is more efficient,’ because maybe some code path never uses\nthe value of X and so it means that we can discard that whole big\nthing. But it also means that it’s much harder to predict in Haskell\nhow fast your program is going to run or what its performance\ncharacteristics are gonna be. In OCaml, it’s much easier to predict\nthat. You can just sort of read your file top to bottom and, within a\nfunction, it just performs the operations that you see roughly in the\norder that you see them. And that means, OCaml again is more explicit\nabout what happens at runtime, but without some of the type\nannotations that we see in Haskell, a little less explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time.\n\nYou mentioned a couple of things that are different that I wonder if\nthey’re really language differences, or just cultural differences. If\nyou look at the tendency to do fewer type annotations on the\ndefinition of functions, you could put more type annotations. And I\nthink there are some people who write OCaml who do, but there’s\ncertainly a tendency not to and I think the Jane Street house style\ncertainly is one that does not have lots of type annotations, outside\nof interface files where those are essentially required everywhere.\n\nAnd the documentation thing, too, like, the interface files are a very\nnatural place to put documentation and I am constantly dissatisfied\nthat I think we put way too little documentation in the (laughs)\nplaces that we could. And I don’t know that there’s anything exactly\nabout the language that forces that. Like, I’m not sure that I buy\n‘the need to put type annotations right on functions’ is the thing\nthat really makes that difference.\n\nThat may be true. It’s hard to say. I do think that form follows\nfunction, function follows form a little bit, in that, when you’re\nused to describing the specification of a thing right next to that\nthing, that, to me, is going to encourage you to write\ndocumentation. Whereas, in OCaml, you write the specification over\nthere, in that other file, nowhere near where you write your\nimplementation. And sometimes I think that means that you’re less\nlikely to put those comments on the implementation when you need them.\n\nIt’s funny. My intuition is the opposite of, like, ‘Oh, I’ve written\nthis very bare interface file that just has types,’ and I think\nempathetically about the person who’s reading it. It’s like, ‘How will\nthey have any idea what this means? I had better put a comment here.’\n(laughs)\n\nRight. So the comment and the interface files are good, but I think\nit’s not just that. I mean, and this could also be, I have a bias in\nthat, most of the OCaml that I’m reading and writing is in the OCaml\ncompiler itself. Maybe this is different than everything else at Jane\nStreet. In fact, I’m sure it is. And it has been striking for me after\nspending so many years working in Haskell’s compiler, that Haskell’s\ncompiler has many, many, many more comments than OCaml’s compiler\ndoes. Maybe I’m overfitting on this particular piece of software\ninstead of just the language in general.\n\nI do think looking at the innards of a compiler is always a weird\nplace to think about how one should write code for the\nlanguage. Because, like, one of the facts about OCaml—as it is often\nthe case for many languages—is that OCaml was written by people who\ndidn’t yet really know how to program in OCaml kind of by\ndefinition. And lots of the code that’s there now has been there for a\nlong time and you can sorta see that. I think if you went to those\nsame people today and been like, ‘How would you write this now?’\nThey’d all be like, ‘Oh, really very differently.’ But, you know,\nparts of it just kind of haven’t been rewritten and have the shape\nthat they did years ago and are harder to understand than kind of\nanyone would exactly like it to be today.\n\nAnd to be fair, that exact same thing is true in the Haskell\ncompiler. There are stretches of that that no one would write it that\nway today. But it was written that way before anyone really knew how\nto program in Haskell.\n\nSo another difference that’s always struck me about Haskell is the\ndifferent approach to language extensions. And I think about this in\ntwo different ways. One is, OCaml is just massively more\nconservative. There was a period in time early in OCaml’s development\nwhere you could almost see the process of Ph.D. students\ngraduating. It’s like someone graduates, they write some language\nfeature, and it gets added to the language. And that stopped pretty\nearly in OCaml. OCaml got pretty conservative about making changes. It\nwas like, ‘No, no, no, we’re gonna add things that are like, really\ngood, and it was pretty restrictive about what would go in. And\nthroughout that time, it kind of had one language, pretty much. OCaml\nworked in one particular way and that was kinda that.\n\nHaskell on the other hand, has had a lot of glorious experimentation\naround language features and those experimental language features were\noften hidden behind pragmas, right? There’s lots of different things\nyou could turn on and off. And so there kind of isn’t one Haskell or\ntwo Haskells, but there’s like 10,000 different Haskells, depending on\nwhich collection of flags you wanna turn on or turn off. You have 10\ndifferent pragmas and now you have two of the 10 different possible\narrangements of the language features. I’m curious how you think about\nthose different sets of choices?\n\nYeah. I mean, that’s a great question. So I do have to push back\nagainst your sense of scale. So Haskell has, when I last counted, and\nthis was a few years ago, 150 or so extensions. So Haskell has\nactually 2150 languages.\n\nOuch, indeed. So I think that this comes from the origin of Haskell\nversus the origin of OCaml so actually you probably know more about\nthe origin of OCaml than I do. But I know Haskell was started by\ncommittee. There was a committee that met starting in, I think, 1989\ninto 1990, coalescing these ideas around a lazy functional programming\nlanguage. And then this eventually became a Haskell standard and there\nwere multiple different compilers for Haskell that all implemented the\nsame standard Haskell. And then maybe one compiler would think, ‘Ooh,\nwouldn’t it be fun if we had X?’ And so, then they would add that\nfeature, but everyone still wanted to make sure that it was a Haskell\ncompiler and not this other special language based on Haskell\ncompilers. So there was an idea of language extension. So you could\nhave base Haskell plus these various extensions.\n\nSo, in other words, OCaml is like Python and Haskell is like Scheme?\n\nSure. Yes. In that OCaml has a manual for the language, but there is\nnot a standard. There are not multiple different software artifacts\nthat all compile some OCaml language that exists beyond a single\ncompiler. But, in any case, going back to Haskell, that was the early\ndays of Haskell and there were multiple Haskell compilers. As time has\ngone on, all of the other ones have either died off or there are still\na few other Haskell compilers out there, but there’s not really an\nattempt to stay current with the newest features. And there’s really\nnow just one: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, or GHC. And that’s the one\nthat, when I say that there’s 150 language extensions, the GHC is\nsupporting that.\n\nAnd so, when you have multiple different things, if you wanted to find\na common core that all of these different compilers can interop with,\nit makes a lot of sense to have individual extensions when you say\nyou’re deviating from this common core. Now there’s really just one\ncompiler.\n\nI think that the current system, the current plan at Haskell, is not\nvery well motivated. And instead, the feedback that I hear from users\nis that they find the whole language extension system very heavy and\nit means that, to get much done in Haskell, you need to now start your\nfile with the list of 20 extensions that you’re using. And newcomers\ncan’t tell the difference between brand new experimental extensions\nthat might change from one compiler to another, or extensions that\nhave been around for 20 years, or there are some extensions that have\nbeen around for 20 years but actually we know are dangerous and you\nreally shouldn’t use.\n\nAnd when I say, ‘We know,’ I mean, like, I know this and a couple of\nother Haskellers know this, but someone just picking up the language\nwon’t know that. And I personally find that quite problematic. And so,\nthere’s a debate going on right now within the GHC Steering Committee\nwho is a body chosen to sort of help evaluate the evolution of the\nlanguage to reimagine all of this. And I’m hoping that we end up with\na structure that looks quite different from what we have today, while\nstill retaining backward compatibility.\n\nSo if you have your 20 language extensions at the top of your file,\nthat will continue to work in this new vision. But I am hoping that we\ncan reorganize it in a way that’s a little bit more user-friendly.\n\nDo you think in the end it would make sense to move toward something\nwhere there’s closer to one standard language that includes most of\nthe extensions, and so that most users end up not thinking about that\n‘two to the whatever’ configuration space?\n\nI do think settling on one standard language would be good. I think we\ncan get 80% of the way there and go from 150 extensions to maybe seven\nor something like that. I don’t think we’ll be able to get all the way\nthere because there’s just too many different use cases for Haskell,\nthere’s too many different people who have slightly different ideas of\nwhat that core should be. So if we just sort of got rid of the\nextensions mechanism, I think that that would cause too much of a rift\nin the community and probably not be tenable. But we can get close.\n\nSo, throughout this conversation, I feel like there’s been a\nparticular kind of vision and idea of what programming is that’s\nmotivated a lot of your thinking. And that has something to do with\nhaving a language that’s simultaneously expressive, it lets you say\nwhat you wanna say, but also has real tools for reasoning, in both\ntype systems and, you know, more sophisticated mode-dependent types,\nor essentially automated tools for reasoning about your program. So in\nthe last, I don’t know, few months, couple of years, there’s been an\nenormous amount of motion in a totally different direction for making\nprogramming better, which is various AI-assisted ways of making\nprogramming easier. With all of this kind of recent work on large\nlanguage models, things like ChatGPT, Codex, all of that, making an\nenormous difference to how people are programming on a regular\nbasis. I’m curious how you think about this and how it fits into your\nbroader way of thinking about programming?\n\nI see this evolution of sort of AI-assisted programming as not quite\nthe sea change that maybe others have seen it to be. I see it as a big\nstep. It’s not a small step change. But it doesn’t remove the need to\ncommunicate precisely. In that, to me, the interesting thing about a\nprogramming language is that it’s a mode of communication that is\nprecise. In a sense, that’s almost the definition of what makes a\nprogramming language a programming language, as opposed to some other\nkind of language. There’s a precise semantics to everything that is\nsaid in that language. And that language is used as a medium of\ncommunication, both from human to computer. That’s how we often think\nof it. But also from human to human.\n\nWith the advent of AI-assisted programming, now we have sort of a new\nmethod of communication in that it’s a communication from computer\nback to human. In that, you might have something like ChatGPT\nproducing the code, but a human still has to read that code and make\nsure that it does what you think it does. And as a medium of precise\ncommunication, it’s still very important to have a programming\nlanguage that allows that communication to happen.\n\nAnd so, this new mode of communication is going to put different\npressures on language design than what we’ve had in the past. But I\ndon’t think it removes the need for programming language design. But\nlike I said, it does create different pressures and these have been\nevident for some time in that one little maxim I’ve had in my head for\nyears now about language design is that you wanna optimize for\nreading, not for writing. Code gets read much more often than it gets\nwritten.\n\nAnd so, when designing a new language feature, maybe you’re thinking,\n‘Okay, I could do this very cleverly with, like, a nicely placed\ntwiddle in this spot in the code. And I could use that twiddle to mean\nsomething very important about my program. And maybe that’s very\nconcise, but it’s hard to read, it’s hard to search for, it’s hard to\ntrain new people to understand. Instead, it tends to be better to\nwrite out words in your design and programming language, that’s easier\nto search for, and easier to learn, and just easier to organize in\nyour brain. If we end up getting to a mode where humans are doing even\nless and less writing, and computers are doing more and more of it,\nthen those pressures just increase. And we wanna make the language\neasier to read and maybe even harder to write. Maybe we even get to a\npoint where if computers are doing all of the code generation, it’s\njust kind of, you know, symbolic and structured. It’s not just text.\n\nSo we get these richer programming languages but I just don’t see it\nas, there was yesterday and then there’s tomorrow and it’s gonna be\ntotally different and let’s just start from scratch. I see this as\njust one phase in evolution of this precise communication medium.\n\nOne of the things that’s really striking about these AI assistants, at\nleast in their current form, is they’re really surprisingly powerful,\nright? They can really do a kind of stunningly good job of taking a\nquery and understanding it and providing a piece of code that tries to\ndo what it is that you asked for it to do.\n\nBut they’re also strikingly fallible. They make lots of mistakes. And,\nyeah, the reading thing is pretty important because you ask ChatGPT\nor, you know, whatever your favorite large language model is, to write\na piece of code and look at the result. And it’s super easy for the\nresult to just be wrong in all sorts of different ways. And I can sort\nof see the rising requirement of making things more readable. I’m\ncurious how you think things like dependent types fit into this story?\n\nSo, dependent types in their essence are a way of writing precise\nspecifications. So the sorting example that I gave earlier, I\ndescribed that, you know, you could have a function instead of going\nfrom ‘a list of ints to a list of ints’ to something more\nglorious. Well, before dependent types, or you know, language without\ndependent types, you could just do that in comments. But probably in\nyour comments, you’re not going to be as precise as you could be if\nyou really wrote it in types, right? You say, you know, return to the\ninput list in ascending order, or something like that. But what does\nthat really mean?\n\nWe need a language where we can precisely specify what this function\nis doing. So as I said earlier, ascending isn’t quite right. I mean,\nif you write in a comment, ‘This returns the input list in ascending\norder,’ well, what if the input list has duplicates? Now you can’t\neven meet that specification. Where actually, that specification\ndoesn’t make any sense at all because the input list isn’t in\nascending order. What does that mean to say to put the input list in\nascending order? That’s a contradiction in terms, because the input\nlist isn’t in ascending order.\n\nAnd so, there’s some amount of interpretation that humans can provide,\ninterpretation that a large language model can provide, but in the\nend, it’s gonna come down to precise communication and\nspecification. And so, where do dependent types fit in? Well, they can\nbecome the input to the large language model. Maybe now we have\nprogrammers who are well-versed in precise communication of\nspecifications, not implementations, and we can say, ‘ChatGPT, give me\na function of this type.’ And then you have your nice type that takes\nan input list, and it returns an output list that is a permutation of\nthe input list in non-decreasing order and we specify that.\n\nAnd then now, that gives a nice specification for ChatGPT to go off\nand say, ‘Okay, here’s an implementation that meets that. Oh, and by\nthe way, it has this asymptotic running time because I’m a nice large\nlanguage model and I’m gonna tell you that.’ And then, now we actually\nhave a model by which we can check that the result meets its\nspecification if it is in this precise language of dependent types.\n\nAlthough I have to say, I think I am more pessimistic about the idea\nof people actually going off and writing down the specifications\neven. ‘Cause those are actually pretty hard to write.\n\nI wonder if a more plausible model is, you go to your large language\nmodel and say, ‘Please write me a specification for a function that\nsorts a list.’ And then it, like, spits something out. And then you\nlook at it and think, yeah, that seems about right. And then you go\nfrom there to next stages. But the role that this kind of concise\nspecification has, it’s like a smaller and maybe more readable thing\nthat you can use as part of verifying whether the later pieces in fact\ndo what you think they’re supposed to do.\n\nYes, but I think there’s a real danger here. I agree with what you say\nin that, writing a precise specification is hard. And humans are\nlazy. So if it’s hard, we’re gonna ask the computer to do it. If we’re\nasking the computer to write the specification of the function that\nit’s going to write, now we’re getting into thin ice. Because if we’re\nworking in a system where the human is not expert enough to be able to\nread the specification and know that it’s the right specification, now\nwe’ve lost. Now the computer can just sort of go off and do whatever\nit wants and we have no way of knowing whether it’s right or wrong\nbecause we’ve lost that ability to sort of have that precise\ncommunication.\n\nI think one of the tricky things here is, people are often pretty bad\nat the reading part of this, right? The idea if something gets written\nand now you have to read it, especially if it wasn’t written in a\nreally clear way, reading some piece of code that is not really\nwell-structured is actually really challenging. Like, one of the\nactually most important parts of the process of code review I find, is\nnot so much that, like, one person writes the code and someone else\nreads it to validate that it’s done the right thing. It’s more like,\nsomebody writes the code and the other person says, ‘Oh, man. This is,\nlike, too messy for me to even read.’ And then there’s some kind of\nback and forth process where you try and get something that’s actually\nsimple enough to be understood. And I think it’s an interesting open\nquestion of, like, as we start using more of these AI assistants, how\ngood they will be at generating things that are actually simple.\n\nAlthough, if we have precise specifications, the simplicity of the\nimplementation becomes less important.\n\nThat’s fair. I mean, in some sense there’s a kind of open\ntechnological question of, like, how good will large language models\nbe, acting as tactics for theorem provers?\n\nRight. Yeah. I mean, but if we’re in an environment where there is a\ntight correspondence between the specification and the implementation,\nand what I mean by ‘tight correspondence’ is this dependent type’s\nmodel where you can—and there’s other models, it’s not just dependent\ntypes, there’s refinement types, there’s other ways of checking an\nimplementation against a specification. But if we’re in an environment\nwhere we can check an implementation against a specification, the\nspecification is simple enough and communicated precisely whether\nthat’s in very careful natural language or probably not just natural\nlanguage ‘cause natural language is very, very squishy. But probably\nin some specification language, you could call that specification\nlanguage ‘dependent types’ if you want or you could call it something\nelse. But if we can communicate that specification, check the\nimplementation against the specification, now suddenly there’s not all\nthat much incentive to ever read the implementation.\n\nRight. It becomes a little bit like, you know, reading the output of\nthe compiler.\n\nYeah. It’s interesting. I do wonder whether a whole potential kind of\ndirection for innovation here, which you more or less have pointed in\nthe direction of, is designing languages that work usefully in this\nkind of intermediate things to generate in the process of working with\nsome kind of AI assistant. The thing that’s generated as an\nintermedium really affects the overall process of working on the\nsystem and generating confidence it’s doing the right thing. It’s not\na totally new problem, I guess, in the context of language design. But\nit does put new kinds of pressure and maybe changes the trade-offs\nthat show up.\n\nYeah, that’s right. I mean, you know, it’s too early, I think, to\nstart to design a programming language around this kind of\ninteraction. We’ve only been having these interactions with these\nassistants for a few months. And they’re changing fast. So I think now\nwould be the wrong time. In two years, maybe one could start thinking\nabout designing a language from scratch to do this. That sounds\nplausible to me. But I think a good starting point would be languages\nthat we have now because they’re designed for precise\ncommunication. That’s, in the end, what we need. And, again, maybe\nthere’s less pressure on the writing piece and more pressure on the\nreading piece. But I don’t think that they’re so divorced from each\nother that it means that we throw out everything we have and start\nfrom scratch. That seems, to me, pretty unlikely.\n\nThat makes sense. Well, thanks so much for joining me. This has been a\nlot of fun.\n\nYou’ll find a complete transcript of the episode, along with links to\nsome of the things that we discussed at signalsandthreads.com. Thanks\nfor joining us and see you next time.",

    "fullText": "America’s distilleries have faced a perfect storm of economic and market headwinds that has pushed many out of business in recent years.\n\nFirst, many Americans are drinking less, especially younger ones.\n\n\"Young adults in the U.S. have become progressively less likely to use alcohol over the past two decades, with the percentages of 18- to 34-year-olds saying they ever drink, that they drank in the past week and that they sometimes drink more than they shouldall lower today. At the same time, drinking on all three metrics has trended up among older Americans while holding fairly steady among middle-aged adults,\" according to a Gallup poll.\n\n62% of adults under age 35 say they drink, down from 72% two decades ago.\n\nConversely, drinking has increased among adults aged 55 and older.\n\nYoung adults are also drinking less frequently and are less likely to drink to excess.\n\nIn addition, distilleries continue to feel the effects of tariffs imposed during President Donald Trump’s administration, which have increased production costs and contributed to a sharp drop in U.S. whiskey exports to key markets like the EU.\n\n“We’re very worried about what tariffs could do to our industry,” said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers Association, reported WKYT.\n\nTake those two challenges together, and it's not surprising that American distilleries, including Artisan Distillery & Craft Bar, have decided to close their doors.\n\nThose impacts are already being felt.\n\nAmerican Whiskey exports to the EU, the U.S. spirits industry’s largest export market, have tumbled by 33% and cost $300 million since the EU’s 25% retaliatory tariff went into effect on June 22, 2018, according to a new report released by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States on the two-year anniversary.\n\nThe EU levied the destructive tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.\n\n“American distillers enjoyed two decades of unparalleled growth in the EU prior to the implementation of these retaliatory tariffs,” said Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). “This report makes clear that these tariffs took the wind out of the sails for American Whiskey exports to our top export market, which has resulted in a loss of more than a quarter of a billion dollars of sales.”\n\nArtisan Distillery & Craft Bar became famous for its Spike Vodka, a spirit made with nopal instead of the traditional fermented cereal grains or potatoes. Later, the distillery added gin, whisky, moonshine, and a tequila-like agave liquor and branched out to brewing beer.",

    "title": "My friend, who had no children or wife, died suddenly. His sister is contesting his will. Will she succeed?",
    "description": "“He did not intend to leave anything to his sister, his only living relative.”",
    "fullText": "A friend died suddenly six months ago. He had told my husband and me that he did not intend to leave anything to his sister, his only living relative. He has no spouse or children. Someone closer to the situation told us she is contesting the will. In the probate filing, which is in the public domain, she is listed as “interested person.” There is also a personal representative. They are represented by the same lawyer. That doesn’t seem right.\n\nMy friend, who had no children or wife, died suddenly. His sister is contesting his will. Will she succeed?\n\n‘It’s been a struggle getting payments from her’: I rent a house to our daughter. Do I just gift her the house?\n\nFor the first time in years, more homeowners have a 6% mortgage rate than a 3% one. That’s great news for frustrated buyers.\n\nThis 100-year-old stock-market indicator just flashed a buy signal. Here’s how investors should read it.\n\nTrying to Preserve My Friend’s Wishes\n\nYour friend’s sister and the “personal representative” — likely, the executor of the will who is representing your friend’s wishes as set out in his will — sharing the same lawyer would only amount to a conflict of interest for the attorney in question if the sister files a lawsuit to contest the will. If that happened, I assume the lawyer would decline to take the sister’s case.\n\nOnly someone with legal standing — an executor, heir, creditor or beneficiary, for example — can typically file a petition in a case such as this. A friend of the deceased, in most cases, has no standing to complain about attorney conflicts. Courts expect the client who is impacted, not a third party, to raise potential ethical issues.\n\nA conflict of interest would arise only if the sister formally contests the will or otherwise takes a position directly against the estate. The lawyer would be required to withdraw from representing one of the parties or, possibly, withdraw entirely. Until that happens, shared representation alone is not improper.\n\n“When an executor or administrator has a personal interest in the estate, such as being a beneficiary, it can create a conflict of interest that may make it difficult for them to act impartially,” says GP Schoemakers, a law firm based in Houston. Being an heir and a beneficiary does not alone mean an executor should be removed. However, mismanagement of the estate or failure to perform duties could be considered problematic.\n\nA will can generally be contested among these grounds: lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence from a family member, and improper execution. The latter is often the easiest and most common way a will is contested and/or overturned. A person will often state they intend to disinherit a child or a sibling, in this case or, alternatively, leave them a small amount, or they might say any person who attempts to contest the will should be automatically barred from inheriting.\n\nThere are statutes of limitations to contest a will. The sister will have to act swiftly and hire a trust-and-estates lawyer. In California, for example, those deadlines are particularly short and, experts say, rigorously enforced. A will contest must be filed by the later of 120 days after the will is admitted to probate or 60 days after the contestant is served with notice of the court order admitting the will. If the will has not yet been admitted to probate, your friend’s sister may raise objections, but once the probate order is entered, the statutory time limits take effect.\n\nAll that said, here’s the harsh truth: It’s extremely difficult to contest a will, and the burden of proof lies with your friend’s sister. Sometimes, these third parties hope to slow down the process and hope that the estate or rightful/legal heir will settle in order to move on. I’ve received many letters where the case seems stronger than the one you describe; one reader wrote to say her millionaire cousin’s nursing home coerced her into changing her will and selling her house. That looked to be a clear breach of ethics and fiduciary duty.\n\nLack of testamentary capacity is one relatively common reason that could make a will vulnerable to being challenged, and could also leave one open to undue influence, duress or fraud, at least in the eyes of the court. “Unlike other grounds for challenging a will, capacity disputes often involve deeply personal family dynamics, medical testimony and complex legal standards that can determine the outcome of an estate plan,” says the Casiano Law Firm, which has offices in San Diego.\n\nMany states also provide a surviving spouse with a minimum “elective” share — that is, the right to take a share of a deceased spouse’s property. This serves to avoid the complete disinheritance of a surviving spouse. Some people might try to circumvent a spouse’s elective-share rights by transferring property to an irrevocable trust, but they generally must survive a look-back period for such a maneuver to work. Obviously, that does not apply to your friend, as he died without a spouse.\n\nBut your friend’s sister has her work cut out for her — and her own lawyer’s fee to pay.\n\nPrevious columns by Quentin Fottrell:\n\n‘I’m in a financial mess’: My income was cut in half.

    "fullText": "Chiles head girls basketball coach Troy Hartmann was dismissed Jan. 8 after his arrest by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement the previous night after a basketball game at the school.\n\nHartmann is charged with obscene communication use of computer to seduce, solicit and lure a child, harmful explicit communication to a minor, obscene material distribution of information harmful to minors, and unlawful use of a two-way communication device, according to court records.\n\nDuring his first appearance in court at 11 a.m. Jan. 8, Leon Circuit Judge Stefanie M. Newlin ordered Hartmann not to have contact with minors and prohibited his use of the internet.\n\n\"The investigation began in November 2025 when agents with FDLE’s Tallahassee Regional Operations Center conducted an undercover operation aimed at targeting online predators. During the operation, Hartmann contacted an undercover FDLE agent who Hartmann believed to be a 15-year-old female. Hartmann’s charges are based on his communications with the agent acting in an undercover capacity,\" FDLE wrote in a statement released Jan. 8.\n\nThe investigation into Hartmann is still active.\n\n\"Now, he’ll be in court — not on the court,\" FDLE wrote in a post on social media that included a photo of him handcuffed outside a patrol vehicle and the school.\n\nIn an email to parents Thursday morning, Chiles Principal Joseph Burgess assured them that \"no Chiles or LCS students were involved in this matter.\"\n\nLeon County Schools spokesperson Chris Petley said Hartmann was not on the payroll or considered an employee of the district and instead was a \"volunteer coach.\"\n\n\"This morning the administration met with the student-athletes and notified their parents of the circumstances including the promotion of Coach Michael Quiggins as the Interim Chiles Head Girls Basketball Coach. Our young ladies will continue to compete and represent Chiles High School,\" Burgess wrote in the email.\n\nHartmann moved to Florida in 2014 and was the co-head coach with the Tallahassee City League. He began coaching at Chiles in 2021 and at the time told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter he was \"excited about getting the head coaching job. With my background and the staff I have, we can elevate the program.\"\n\nAccording to court records that were initially posted to the Leon County Clerk website before being removed for redaction, Hartmann used the social media platform, Kik, to reach out to a user in a \"Tally\" group chat.\n\n\"Hartmann is the owner of the Kik account 'big dirk,' which has been used repeatedly to engage in sexual conversations with minors,\" police reports say, noting he also used the alias \"Eric.\"\n\nThe user he reached out to was an undercover officer with \"2010\" in their username. Hartmann allegedly told the user he was 36 years old and assumed she was 15, the court records say.\n\nThe undercover officer told Hartmann they are currently enrolled in a local high school. After that Hartmann allegedly asked the user if she ever had sex before and expressed that he wanted to engage in sexual conduct, according to the records.\n\nIn another incident with a user said to be 15-years-old, Hartmann allegedly acknowledged the teen's age and proceeded to send her a picture of his genitals and engaged in sexual conversation with her, the court records state.\n\nAlaijah Brown covers children & families for the Tallahassee Democrat.

    "fullText": "A 550-pound black bear that had been living under an Altadena man’s home for more than a month has finally been removed, thanks to help from a wildlife rescue group.\n\n“I’m relieved – no more banging under the house and smelling him and wondering what’s going on under there,” Ken Johnson, the homeowner, told KTLA’s Jillian Smukler on Thursday.\n\nJohnson said the bear took up residence in the crawlspace beneath his home just before Thanksgiving, and repeated efforts to coax it out didn’t work.\n\nState wildlife officials tried to remove the bear using paintball guns, air horns and other tactics – but were unsuccessful. Johnson said the effort stalled after officials received instructions from Sacramento to pull back.\n\nAfter that, he threatened to sue the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for negligence and emotional distress.\n\nThe breakthrough, however, came when the BEAR League, a nonprofit based in Lake Tahoe, offered to help at no cost. The team, Johnson said, used similar methods to those employed by state agencies – paintball guns – but completed the job in about 10 minutes on Tuesday.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it was so fast,” Johnson said. “These guys went in, they crawled in behind him and, boom, he was out.”\n\nWhen the bear returned two nights later to climb back into the crawlspace, it encountered an electrified mat over the opening that gave it a small shock — so it took off. Only time will tell if it’s gone for good.\n\nJohnson described the removal as a “late Christmas gift.” He can now assess the damage the bear caused underneath his home, which includes a ruptured gas line.",

    "description": "\"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration believes you don't have the right to record Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in public. This stance is both factually wrong and an attempt to chill free speech by conflating it with violence.\n\nAt a July 2025 press conference in Tampa, Florida, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said, \"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations, encouraging other people to come and to throw things, rocks, bottles.\"\n\nIn September 2025, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin called \"videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online\" a form of doxing. She added, \"We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nThese aren't idle threats. The Trump administration strong-armed Apple into removing an app from its mobile store that tracked ICE activity and threatened criminal investigations into its creators.\n\nThe most aggressive application of this policy has come in Chicago under \"Operation Midway Blitz,\" where ICE officers have relentlessly targeted protesters, reporters, and clergy engaged in protected First Amendment activity.\n\nIn October, a group of journalists and protesters filed a lawsuit alleging \"a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians.\"\n\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs stated that federal officials' own testimony illustrated their point. For example, when ICE field director Russell Hott was asked if he agreed \"that it's unconstitutional to arrest people for being opposed to Midway Blitz,\" he answered \"No.\"\n\n\"Similarly, [U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Greg] Bovino testified that he has instructed his officers to arrest protesters who make hyperbolic comments in the heat of political demonstrations, even though such statements—which do not constitute true threats—are protected speech,\" the motion argued. (Hott and Bovino's depositions were filed under seal, and those comments were later redacted in a corrected filing by the lawsuit plaintiffs, but not before others took screenshots of them.)\n\nBased on voluminous evidence that feds in Chicago ignored her previous orders to curb their use of force, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction against DHS in early November 2025, saying the government's conduct \"shocked the conscience.\"\n\nEllis found much of the officials' testimony not credible. Bovino, for instance, testified that he never used force against a protester he was filmed tackling, and in another instance, Ellis said, he lied about being hit with a rock before firing tear gas at demonstrators. Nor did evidence support the government's claims that federal officers issued warnings before firing less-than-lethal projectiles at those protesters.\n\n\"Describing rapid response networks and neighborhood moms as professional agitators shows just how out of touch these agents are, and how extreme their views are,\" said Ellis.\n\nThe Trump administration responded by calling Ellis an \"activist judge,\" but it is squarely wrong when it comes to recording and protesting the police. Cato Institute senior fellow Walter Olson points out that, \"While the Supreme Court itself hasn't yet faced the issue squarely, the seven federal circuits that have done so…all agree that the First Amendment protects the right to record police performing their duties in public.\"\n\nLikewise, federal circuits have upheld the right to use vulgar language to oppose police without fear of retaliation, and to warn others of nearby police checkpoints or speed traps.\n\nAs Olson writes, the administration's \"attempt to alter reality by establishing new legal facts on the ground\" ultimately serves as a green light for informal repression. \"If the agents come to believe that they have blanket immunity [for] whatever they do, or that citizens have no right to record them, they are more likely to take aggressive informal action, such as grabbing phones or taking news reporters into custody on charges of obstruction (perhaps later quietly dropped).\"\n\nIt's not hard to find examples of this rotten agency culture in practice. In late October 2025, ICE officers broke out the window of a U.S. citizen's car and detained her for seven hours after she followed and photographed their unmarked vehicles. DHS accused her of reckless driving, attempting to block in officers with her car, and resisting arrest—all claims that she and her lawyer deny. Prosecutors did not charge the woman with a crime.\n\nRecording government agents is one of the few tools citizens have to hold state power accountable. Any attempt to redefine observation as \"violence\" is not only unconstitutional—it's authoritarian gaslighting. When a government fears cameras more than crimes, it isn't protecting the rule of law. It's protecting itself.\n\nThe post The Trump Administration Says It's Illegal To Record Videos of ICE. Here's What the Law Says. appeared first on Reason.com.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says he wants to block large institutions from buying single-family homes, arguing that housing should belong to people, not corporations.\n\nThe proposal lands as U.S. home prices and mortgage costs sit near record highs, keeping many first-time buyers locked out of the market.\n\nOne billionaire investor says the idea makes sense, even if the details are still unclear.\n\nIn a post shared on Jan. 7, President Donald Trump said he is “immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single family homes,” adding that he will push Congress to “codify it.”\n\nTrump framed the move as a response to affordability strain, writing that:\n\n“Buying and owning a home” was once “the pinnacle of the American Dream,” but is now “increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.”\n\nU.S. housing data backs up the pressure.\n\nThe median price for an existing home hit a record high in 2025, while mortgage rates stayed above 6%, pushing monthly payments further out of reach for many first-time buyers.\n\nEven with sales volumes near historic lows, limited inventory and years of underbuilding have kept prices elevated, reinforcing the political appeal of targeting institutional demand.\n\nIn an exclusive response to TheStreet Roundtable, Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban said he supports the idea in principle.\n\n“I’m fine with it,” Cuban said, when asked about Trump’s proposal. “If it has some unintended consequences, they can always unwind it.”\n\nCuban’s reaction carries weight because he sits at the intersection of business, investing and policy debates. He has long argued that affordability issues are shaped by multiple forces, including insurance costs, supply constraints and local regulation.\n\nNew report reveals US may have sold Bitcoin despite Trump exec order\n\nU.S. housing crisis sparks boom in crypto-backed mortgages\n\nVenezuela could hold as much Bitcoin as Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy\n\nWhen pressed on what unintended consequences might look like, Cuban said they are hard to predict in advance.\n\n“Meaning you can’t anticipate everything,” he said, adding “I don’t know what they could be.”\n\nHis answer highlights both the appeal and the risk of blunt policy tools.\n\nWhile restricting large buyers could ease competition in some markets, it does not address the deeper shortage of homes that economists say is the main driver of high prices.",

    "description": "The president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more in a revealing new interview",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said that his only guardrail as he looks to obtain more global power is \"my own morality\"\n\nIn a new interview with The New York Times, he said he doesn't \"need international law\" to dictate his approach to foreign policy\n\nAlso in the interview, the president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making it clear that he won't be constrained by the law as he continues teasing a takeover of the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I don’t need international law,” Trump said in a new interview with The New York Times. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”\n\nWhen pressed further, the president said he understood that his administration would need to abide by international laws. However, he added, \"It depends what your definition of international law is.\"\n\nThere is, Trump insisted, just \"one thing\" that can curtail his desire for global supremacy: \"My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.\"\n\nThe interview comes less than a week after U.S. forces, under Trump's direction, captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, first lady Cilia Flores, amid \"large-scale strikes\" on the capital city of Caracas, and brought them to the U.S. to stand trial on multiple charges related to narco terrorism.\n\nThough Venezuela has installed an interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump has stated many times that the United States is now in charge of running the independent nation.\n\n\"It's going to be run very judiciously, very fairly. And it's gonna make a lot of money,\" he previously said. \"You know they stole our oil. We built that whole industry and they just took it over like we were nothing. So we did something about it. We're late, but we did something about it.\"\n\nHe later added, \"We'll be selling large amounts of oil [from Venezuela] to other countries... We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"\n\n\"We're gonna make sure the people of Venezuela are taken care of... You're going to have peace, justice...you're going to have a real country.\"\n\nHe doesn't plan to stop there. The president is also fixated on his desire to annex Greenland, which is currently controlled by Denmark, a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nTrump admitted that \"it may be a choice\" to preserve the country's relationship with NATO versus taking over Greenland, an important trade crossroads between the U.S., Europe, China and Russia.\n\n“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” he said to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”\n\nTo The New York Times, he insisted that it wasn't enough to have the country controlled by an ally — he wants exclusive, outright ownership.\n\n“Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also has his sights set on Colombia, Cuba, Iran and Mexico.\n\n\"You have to do something with Mexico. Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something,\" he previously told reporters, referring to drug cartels in the country.\n\n\"We'd love Mexico to do it. They're capable of doing it, but unfortunately, the cartels are very strong in Mexico,\" Trump added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nReferring to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Trump said his country is being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long.\"\n\nPetro spoke with the Times prior to calling Trump to discuss the threats, expressing his concern about the U.S. making a strike in Colombia, similar to the one in Venezuela.\n\n“We are in danger,” the Colombian president said. “Because the threat is real. It was made by Trump.”",

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, January 8, 2026: A nudge higher for the week",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates, which are testing 6% lows. Shop multiple lenders and lock in your best mortgage rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates remain in the low 6% range. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate for the week is 6.16%, up one basis point. The 15-year fixed rate weekly average was 5.46%, up two basis points. For weeks, home loan interest rates have been making only fractional moves, but remember, mortgage rates vary by location, even by state.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate with not just banks, but also credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is a fantastic mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on what your financial goals are when refinancing, and when your break-even point would be after paying refinance closing costs.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nRefinancing your home loan can help you pay off other debt, especially if you qualify for a cash-out refinance.

    "title": "USMC XQ-58 Valkyrie Development Makes Leap Forward With New Contract (Updated)",
    "description": "Northrop Grumman has now joined the effort to craft a fully missionized version of Kratos' XQ-58 for the Marine Corps.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps’ pursuit of a fully missionized version of Kratos’ stealthy XQ-58A Valkyrie drone has taken another step forward with a new announcement that Northrop Grumman is now aiding in the effort. Northrop Grumman says it will deliver a “mission kit” that includes its Prism autonomy package, sensors, and other capabilities to help fully turn the Valkyrie into what looks set to be the Marines’ first operational Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA).\n\nNorthrop Grumman announced today it has received a competitively awarded deal in relation to what is formally known as the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Uncrewed Expeditionary Tactical Aircraft (MUX TACAIR) Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. U.S. officials confirmed last year that the Marine Corps was moving to transition its experimental work with the XQ-58 into a full program of record to develop and field an operational CCA-type drone. The Marines have acquired at least three Valkyries since 2023. The U.S. Air Force is the only other known current operator of the XQ-58 and has been using the type for test and evaluation work since its first flight in 2019.\n\nUnder the newly announced deal, “Northrop Grumman will develop and rapidly deliver platforms that include” the aforementioned mission kit, “inclusive of sensors and software-defined technologies designed specifically for uncrewed aircraft,” according to a company press release. “The mission kit’s flexible technology can perform various kinetic and non-kinetic effects, making the platform a combat-ready asset.”\n\n“Northrop Grumman’s open architecture autonomy software package – known as Prism – will manage the aircraft’s operations autonomously,” the release adds. The company has already been conducting flight testing involving Prism using the Model 437 Vanguard jet, now also referred to as Beacon, which was developed and built by its subsidiary Scaled Composites.\n\n“Northrop Grumman remains at the forefront of advanced sensing capabilities, delivering innovative solutions that meet the needs of the warfighter with unmatched speed and reliability,” Krys Moen, Vice President for Advanced Mission Capabilities, said in an accompanying statement. “This enhanced capability set ensures optimal performance for both crewed and uncrewed platforms.”\n\n“The integration of the Kratos Valkyrie aircraft system configured with the world’s best multifunction mission systems from Northrop Grumman results in a high-capability CCA at a price point that enables the uncrewed systems to be deployed in mass with crewed aircraft,” Steve Fendley, President of Kratos’ Unmanned Systems Division, also said in a statement included in the release.\n\nNorthrop Grumman’s press release also highlights Kratos’ work on a derivative of the XQ-58 with built-in landing gear. As originally designed, Valkyrie is fully runway independent and takes off via a rocket-assisted method from a static launcher. The drone is then recovered via parachute at the end of the sortie. Kratos has also developed a special trolley that allows versions without fixed landing gear to take off from traditional runways.\n\nNorthrop Grumman has separately told Breaking Defense that its MUX TACAIR CCA deal is valued at approximately $231.5 million and covers work over a period of 24 months, and that is a so-called Other Transactional Agreement (OTA). The U.S. military uses the OTA mechanism to support rapid prototyping and other research and development work without having to go through more traditional and often more drawn-out contracting processes.\n\nOfficial U.S. military budget documents released last year said that the Marines were looking to acquire at least one MUX TACAIR CCA prototype in a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) configuration. Kratos has referred to the fixed landing gear Valkyrie derivative as the CTOL version. However, whether that is the only configuration the Marines are eyeing now is unclear, and TWZ has reached out to Northrop Grumman, Kratos, and the Marine Corps \n\n“So we’re obviously, we’ve been doing a lot of development work for the Marines, a lot of integration of mission systems, a lot of ground and flight test of those mission systems,” Kratos’ Fendley had told TWZ on the show floor of the annual Modern Day Marine conference in Washington, D.C., last year. “And that’s continued to where we’re pretty close to having a couple final versions of the aircraft.”\n\nTWZ has previously highlighted the value a runway-independent version would bring to the Marine Corps, given the service’s current focus on future expeditionary and distributed operations. Flexibility to operate from traditional runways, which could offer benefits in terms of total payload capacity and maximum range, could still be desirable, as well.\n\nOverall, “the uncrewed weapons systems under development [as part of the MUX TACAIR program] will enhance Marine Corps Aviation’s lethality and ability to support the Stand-in Force (SiF) by delivering air-to-ground, reconnaissance, and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities,” per the aforementioned budget documents. “The Marine Corps will use a spiral approach for capability insertion into TACAIR. MUX TACAIR Increment I will rapidly accelerate the time between development and fielding, ensuring rapid and relevant capability delivery of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to the warfighter.”\n\nThere has also been explicit talk about pairing the XQ-58 with the Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, and flight tests to explore this kind of crewed-uncrewed teaming have been carried out in the past.\n\nOutside of work for the Marine Corps, beyond the aforementioned developments related to launching and recovering the Valkyrie, Kratos has been steadily working to expand the performance and other capabilities of the design. The company is separately working on a miniature cruise missile called Ragnarok, which the XQ-58 can carry in its internal bay and externally under its wings, and that you can read more about here. Renderings have also shown Valkyries with AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) under their wings. Northrop Grumman has put forward the uncrewed aircraft as a notional launch platform for its Lumberjack loitering one-way attack drone, as well.\n\nThe XQ-58 has a high degree of modularity baked in from the start. Kratos has long put heavy emphasis on open-architecture systems to make it easier to integrate new and improved capabilities and functionality down the line, as well.\n\nRegardless of the aircraft’s physical configuration, there are many other questions the Marine Corps will still need to answer before it can truly field an operational CCA force, something the service itself has been open about and that TWZ regularly highlights. Much remains to be settled about how CCA-type drones will be deployed, launched, recovered, supported, and otherwise operated on a day-to-day basis, let alone employed tactically in a real-world combat environment.\n\n“We still have a lot to learn simply to get this thing airborne, flying, and executing next to an F-35, and not hitting each other,” Col. Derek Brannon, director of the Marine Corps’ Cunningham Group, said at the Modern Day Marine exhibition last year. “I know there’s a lot of work out there, but that’s important to make sure that we become lethal.”\n\nThe Cunningham Group, which falls under the office of the Deputy Commandant for Aviation, is charged with plotting out the overall future course for Marine Corps aviation developments.\n\nThis all applies equally to the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy CCA programs. All three services are pursuing their efforts in very close cooperation, including in the development of common command and control architectures. By the Navy’s own admission, the Air Force and Marine Corps CCA programs are much more mature than its effort.\n\nJoining the Marine Corps MUX TACAIR program is an important development for Northrop Grumman as a company, which has been making other inroads in the growing CCA market space recently. In December, the Air Force announced that it had assigned a formal designation, YFQ-48A, to the Project Talon drone design developed by Northrop Grumman and its subsidiary Scaled Composites. The service also said at that time that the YFQ-48A, which had only been unveiled publicly earlier in the month, was a “strong contender” for inclusion in its CCA efforts. Project Talon leveraged lessons from Northrop Grumman’s losing entry in the competition for the first phase, or Increment 1, of the Air Force’s CCA program, as you can learn more about here. Last September, the Navy also confirmed that Northrop Grumman was among the companies it had awarded contracts to for the development of concepts for future carrier-based CCAs.\n\nProject Talon is here. This next-gen autonomous aircraft is made to adapt fast.\n\nBuilt for the challenges ahead pic.twitter.com/6UOhLSBHKn\n\n— Northrop Grumman (@northropgrumman) December 4, 2025\n\nThe Marine Corps moving to field an operational version of the Valkyrie has been significant for Kratos, as well. The company has been very actively pitching versions of the XQ-58 to other customers, including ones overseas. It is working now with Airbus to craft a version for the German armed forces. Kratos has also been seeing growing export success with other designs in its tactical drone portfolio.\n\nWhen it comes to the Marine Corps CCA plans, the service has said it hopes to take delivery of the first prototype before the end of this year, and Northrop Grumman has now joined Kratos in working to make that a reality.\n\nNorthrop Grumman has now provided additional details about how it is working together with Kratos in relation to the MUX TACAIR CCA effort, and about what the company will be contributing.\n\n“Northrop Grumman and Kratos teamed up to respond together to the Naval Aviation Systems Consortium Statement of Need Request for White Papers for USMC TACAIR Increment 1 (N00019-24-9-0021).  Northrop Grumman and Kratos have collaborated successfully together on multiple projects in prime and support roles including Valkyrie,” a company spokesperson explained to TWZ. “Due to the collaborative integration needed for this solution, the team jointly decided Northrop Grumman as Lead Systems Integrator and Kratos as airframe subcontractor provided the best approach for MUX TACAIR.”\n\n“The mission kit is a fully integrated sensor suite covering multiple functions and frequency bands,” they added. “Northrop Grumman is integrating both Northrop sensors and a variety of best of breed industry sensors into a low-cost integrated solution.”\n\n“Kratos is teamed with NGC for mission configured Valkyrie derivatives and is also a subcontractor on the MUX TACAIR contract providing Valkyrie aircraft, supporting development and testing including flight testing, and supporting integration of NGC mission systems for the ultimate Marines CCA product, which Kratos will manufacture in Oklahoma City,” a spokesperson for that company also separately told TWZ.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

Human rights groups were encouraged by the releases, though it wasn’t clear yet whether this might represent the early stages of a government in transition or was more of a symbolic effort to please the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro’s loyalists to stay in control even as it exerts political pressure through crippling sanctions.\n\nJournalists, lawyers and human rights activists were among those freed on Thursday, and families waited outside a notorious prison in hopes their loved ones would be among the detainees released.\n\n“Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,” Rodríguez said in an announcement publicized over TV.\n\nNGO: 863 detained for ‘political reasons’\n\nAlfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Caracas, praised Thursday’s release as “good news” that lifted Venezuelans’ hopes that all political detainees in the country may walk free.\n\nBut he stressed that he wanted this to become “the beginning of the dismantling of the repressive system” of Maduro’s government and not remain “a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others.”\n\nDespite a widespread crackdown during the tumultuous 2024 election – in which the government said it detained 2,000 people – Venezuela's government denies that there are “political prisoners” and accuses those detained of plotting to destabilize Maduro’s government.\n\nRomero's organization said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela “for political reasons.”\n\nThe Spanish government announced Thursday that five Spanish citizens were among those released in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.\n\nForeign Minister José Manuel Albares confirmed the group includes prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel. Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, he also confirmed that Spanish citizens Andrés Martínez, José María Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno were freed.\n\nBasoa and Martínez were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024, accused by officials of being involved in a plot to destabilize Maduro’s government as Spanish intelligence agents, allegations that Spanish authorities denied at the time. Spain’s El País newspaper reported Thursday that Gorbe had been living in Venezuela and was arrested in 2024, accused of being in the country illegally with an expired visa.\n\nA number of families of those detained rushed to wait outside of a number of Venezuelan prisons on Thursday, hoping to reunite with their loved ones.\n\nPedro Durán, 60, was among those hoping to wrap his arm around his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside a prison in the town of Guatire, around 25 miles (43 kilometers) outside of Caracas. Durán said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro’s government — an accusation the family fiercely denies.\n\nDurán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors that the government may be releasing a number of detainees on Wednesday and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.\n\n“I don’t have words to express the emotion I’m feeling,” Durán said. “We’re feeling a lot of hope ... We’re just waiting now.”\n\nDespite the anticipation, fear persists in parts of the South American country as residents brace for an uncertain future.\n\n“Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven’t done already,” he said.\n\nRonal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government periodically releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.\n\nIn July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for getting home more than 200 migrants deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where they were held in a prison built to hold alleged gang members.\n\n“The regime uses them (prisoners) like a bargaining chip,” he said, adding that he and other observers will be watching not just how many people the government releases, but also whether high-profile individuals are included or if they're being released under a condition of house arrest.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela’s petroleum worldwide.\n\nBoth moves reflect the administration’s determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the U.S. will “run” the country.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

First responders were called to the area after the crew of an outbound Metra train reported seeing a body along the tracks.\n\nParamedics pronounced the man dead at the scene. He was identified as 30-year-old Allen Chiquini of Mundelein, according to the coroner’s office.\n\nAn autopsy conducted Jan. 5 determined Chiquini died from blunt force head injuries consistent with being struck by a train.\n\nInvestigators said video evidence showed Chiquini had boarded an earlier northbound train, mistakenly believing it was traveling southbound. After being unable to open the passenger doors, he exited through the rear of the train by climbing over a safety barrier.\n\nThe coroner’s office said Chiquini either fell or attempted to step off the train while it was in motion.

    "description": "Larry Page is leaving California ahead of the proposed billionaire's tax, and Jensen Huang is staying. It shows different appetites for risk.",
    "fullText": "It's a classic fight-or-flight response — with a billionaire's twist.\n\nA proposed wealth tax in California prompted the state's resident billionaires to consider whether they wanted to continue their residency if the one-time 5% tax is approved.\n\nTheir reactions, said CFP professional Don Hilario, who works with financial planning clients in California, boil down to risk tolerance.\n\nThe tax, as proposed, would only apply to assets in the state during the 2026 tax year. Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved assets out of California ahead of the January 1, 2026, deadline to avoid facing the tax, Business Insider first reported. Meanwhile, Nvidia's billionaire CEO Jensen Huang said he has \"not even thought about it once.\"\n\n\"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,\" Huang told Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow. \"I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\nHilario, whose financial planning clients include individuals in Big Tech, said that the lingering uncertainty of the tax can trigger a need for certainty and autonomy.\n\n\"People who want to have a greater sense of control will do the Larry Page route,\" he said, \"versus people who have the temperament to endure will take Jensen's route.\"\n\nHilario described a hypothetical scenario in which individuals with high net worths are considering purchasing a home. In a period where the economy and interest rates are uncertain, do you want to put the lion's share of your expenses toward the home in the event that rates will be higher in the future, or do you hold out and continue accumulating your wealth in the event that economic conditions improve?\n\n\"That's the same type of emotions that exist with this tax bill because the fear of not taking any action is unsettling,\" Hilario said.\n\nThe proposal, put forth by the union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West to offset potential budget cuts to healthcare and education, is far from being implemented — it would require 870,000 signatures to make it onto the November 2026 ballot.\n\nThe SEIU said in its proposal that the concentration of billionaire wealth in California makes the state \"uniquely positioned to address both the well-documented crisis of wealth inequality in the United States and the emerging and interrelated crises the state faces\" with the budget cuts.\n\nIn addition to Huang, Brin, and Page, other billionaires are voicing their opinions on the proposed wealth tax. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, wrote in a post on X that the proposal has \"massive flaws.\"\n\n\"Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,\" he said.\n\nAlex Spiro, an attorney who has previously represented billionaires, wrote in a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax were to become law. Hilario said that the significant uncertainty surrounding the proposal, including how assets will be valued and whether the tax would change over time, likely forced billionaires to decide how risk-averse they really are.\n\n\"I still think ultimately it's unclear. And I think when it's unclear, it'll make people, in this case, investors, be more cautious and defensive,\" Hilario said. \"And then a big part of it is, how do we respond emotionally? I think whether you're taking early action or enduring, you do want to gather information and avoid making a decision that would ultimately be irreversible.\"",

    "description": "As farmland prices fall in west Fresno County, one farmer bought property for its access to groundwater.",
    "fullText": "With farmland prices sagging and new irrigation rules coming, diversified farmer Michael Vander Dussen didn’t hesitate to spend $1.4 million for 321 acres in west Fresno County, as an insurance policy of sorts.\n\nVander Dussen admits he isn’t as interested in the land as much as its access to water. He recently planted a field of pistachio trees nearby, and he wants to make sure they survive.\n\n“What I want to do is preserve the ability to continue to irrigate those young trees,” Vander Dussen said. “So I will use some of that water.”\n\nThe state is in the process of implementing new water rules called the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. The goal is to protect groundwater supplies by preventing over-pumping. As part of that, groundwater sustainability agencies have been formed in the high and medium priority basins to ensure the plan is being followed.\n\nVander Dussen said both properties are in the same GSA, groundwater sustainability agency. And he intends to fallow a portion of the new property that is located west of Raisin City and south of Kerman. The farm used to grow Ruby Seedless grapes.\n\nThe Fresno Bee has started tracking these types of agriculture land sales using an AI tool that we developed to more efficiently share this news with you. Bee journalists use their reporting and writing skills to create the stories. The tool alerted us to Vander Dussen’s purchase.\n\nVander Dussen is the owner of Standard Cattle LLC, a company that specializes in raising dairy replacement heifers. But he also grows wheat, corn and hay. He’s added pistachios to his mix of crops, as a way to spread his risk.\n\n“Diversification is a necessity these days because of the ebb and flow of commodity prices,” he said. “It’s feast or famine sometimes.”\n\nHelping farmers like Vander Dussen expand their holdings is the declining value of farmland in parts of Fresno County. Farms with poor-performing crops and only groundwater wells for irrigation have seen the biggest drop in value.\n\nVander Dussen said the farm he recently purchased was valued at about $4,500 an acre. At the peak of California’s almond planting boom, that same land might have sold for $15,000 to $20,000 an acre.\n\n“This is the new norm right now,” Vander Dussen said.",

    "description": "According to an etiquette coach, you should never gossip with coworkers, poke fun at others, or bring up sensitive subjects in the office.",
    "fullText": "From spreading gossip to showing up late to meetings, employees often make subtle missteps when interacting with coworkers.\n\nAlthough many of these mistakes aren't meant to be rude, they can still affect a person's reputation at work. With more and more companies requiring workers to return to the office, it may be time for a refresher on workplace etiquette.\n\nThat's why Business Insider sat down with etiquette coach Mariah Grumet to learn about what to avoid when interacting with colleagues. Here's what she said.\n\nIn the moment, gossiping at work may seem like an opportunity to bond with coworkers. However, Grumet said it's ultimately not an appropriate way to connect with others.\n\n\"We develop close relationships with many coworkers, but there is still that boundary that needs to be respected,\" she told BI. \"It's inappropriate to spread any rumors about other people at the office.\"\n\n\"There are certain topics that should be reserved for places outside of work,\" Grumet told BI. \"We shouldn't be bringing up anything too personal, such as religion, politics, personal health concerns, appearance — anything like that that might be crossing over that boundary.\"\n\nIt's important to remember that some issues may be sensitive for others, and therefore, inappropriate in a professional setting.\n\n\"Even if you have a close relationship with someone at work, you still need to remain professional with your communication,\" Grumet said.\n\nIt's important to respect people's time — and that starts with punctuality.\n\nAccording to Grumet, being on time — whether you're attending a meeting or holding one — is respectful and shows that you care about your work.\n\n\"Being punctual is a representation of your professional image,\" Grumet said.\n\nGrumet said it's important to avoid poking fun at others, as you never know how a joke will be received.\n\n\"You can never be too careful with being respectful,\" she told BI.\n\nEven if humor is your preferred way to communicate, it's important to be cautious of what you joke about in front of coworkers.\n\nIn addition to what you do or say at work, it's also important to be mindful of your body language when interacting with others.\n\n\"Even more so than the words that we say or the tone that we use, people are paying such close attention to body language,\" Grumet said. \"When you are communicating with coworkers, you want to make sure that your body language is supporting your message and not taking away from it or creating a disconnect.\"\n\nAccording to Grumet, some examples of ways to be conscientious of body language in the workplace include leaning forward in meetings to demonstrate when you're listening or not having your arms crossed when someone is speaking to you.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 18, 2024, and most recently updated on January 8, 2025.",

    "description": "Ukraine's commander in chief said December was the first month that its drones \"neutralized\" roughly as many Russians as were called up.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's top general said that for the first time in the war, its drones are killing or seriously wounding Russia's soldiers as fast as it can get new troops into the field.\n\nDrones are the top battlefield threat, responsible for the most casualties in this war. Ukraine relies heavily on them, especially the cheap first-person-view drones, as solutions to its manpower and equipment shortages.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Tuesday in a Telegram post that December was the first month in which Ukraine's uncrewed systems units \"neutralized\" about as many Russian servicemen as it called up in a month.\n\nHe said video confirmed 33,000 Russian losses last month. \"The real losses of the occupiers are greater,\" the general said.\n\nSyrskyi did not provide a number for the number of Russian soldiers called up. Business Insider is unable to independently confirm Syrskyi's claims.\n\nRussia hasn't provided official casualty figures. As for the number of new Russian soldiers sent to Ukraine each month, a US assessment put the number around 30,000 last April. In May, however, the Russian president said that the number was twice that. A Ukrainian intelligence assessment in December said that Russia fulfilled its 2025 mobilization target of 403,000, an average of more than 36,000 a month.\n\nRussia's armed forces in Ukraine are a mixed bag of contract soldiers who volunteer for the fight — Russia attracts volunteers with various perks, like signing bonuses — conscripts pulled in through draft cycles, and other sources. Russia has previously recruited people out of its prisons.\n\nThough exact losses are unclear, Ukrainian and Western intel assessments point to substantial attrition. Russia has a much larger population to draw soldiers from than Ukraine, which is also said to have suffered significant losses in this war. Some estimates put Russian losses at 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWhile Russia has a larger population to pull from, it has tried to avoid repeated large-scale involuntary mobilizations.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin publicly promised not to send conscripts to the front lines, fearing fallout. It has limited what Russia can do with them, even though widespread reporting and captured conscripts say assurances have been misleading.\n\nSyrskyi called 2025 a great breakthrough for Ukraine's drone war and pledged that it would not stop, with plans to grow capabilities further in 2026.\n\nHe said that in December, the number of targets that were hit or destroyed by drones rose by 31% and that the number of Russian personnel hit rose by more than 25%.\n\nSyrskyi said in November that uncrewed systems were responsible for about 60 % of all enemy targets hit. That figure has also been higher, at times, in front-line areas.\n\nDrones directly attack troops and equipment — either by carrying explosives or dropping weapons like grenades — and they also collect intelligence that shapes how armies employ other forces. Even inexpensive drones have had an outsized impact, destroying sophisticated, multimillion-dollar systems such as tanks.\n\nRussia and Ukraine are locked in a drone development race to field greater numbers and more advanced drones, as well as counter-drone technology.\n\nSyrskyi warned that Russia also has ambitious plans for its drones. He said that Russia copied Ukraine by creating a separate part of the military for uncrewed systems and said that it has 80,000 servicemen. He said Russia plans to expand that to 165,500 this year and to almost 210,000 by 2030.\n\nThere are so many drones in the sky that Ukrainian soldiers previously told Business Insider that they were sometimes unable to tell which side any belonged to and would instead try to bring them all down just to be on the safe side.",

    "description": "Brick allows you to temporarily block chosen apps and notifications on your phone. You can only unblock the apps by tapping your phone on the gadget.",
    "fullText": "I'm unfortunately among the millions of people who have become hooked on TikTok, losing countless hours of productivity to 30-second clips of soup recipes I've yet to make, hair-growing products I've yet to buy, and gua sha tutorials I'll likely never try.\n\nTired of spending my one wild and precious life staring at a screen, I decided to make a change. And thanks to Brick, a $59 gadget designed to block phone apps, I've actually been able to follow through.\n\nAs my weekly screen time report became increasingly alarming, I attempted to fight back by setting a daily one-hour limit for Instagram and TikTok on my iPhone. When I realized the limit could be bypassed with the click of a button, the software was quickly rendered completely useless.\n\nThis same struggle is what led TJ Driver and Zach Nasgowitz to create Brick, which allows you to temporarily block chosen apps and their notifications via a physical device that comes in the form of a 3D printed, 2-inch by 2-inch square magnet. You can still access the apps you need throughout the day — like texts, photos, or Google Maps — but Brick makes it harder to give in to the temptation of a quick social media dopamine hit.\n\n\"With other solutions, the 'key' that re-enables distractions is always present,\" the Brick website explains. \"Brick allows you to leave that key behind, turning your phone into a new, distraction-free device until you return.\"\n\nSetting up Brick couldn't be simpler. After downloading the corresponding app and creating an account with my email, I activated my Brick by tapping the top of my phone on the lightweight square. A single Brick can be used with multiple iPhones — unlike your Netflix account, there's no limit — so my fiancé was able to connect his iPhone to it as well.\n\nI was then prompted to allow screen time access to Brick, which gives it the ability to block and unblock apps on the iPhone, and create my first \"Mode.\" You can create different modes to block different apps. I made one titled \"Get to work!\" and chose to block Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X.\n\nYou can activate these modes through the app or by physically tapping your phone on the square. However, you can only deactivate the block by tapping your phone against the Brick.\n\nThe very first day I used Brick, I was forced to come to terms with how hooked I'd become to social media. I caught myself unconsciously picking up my phone multiple times an hour to check Instagram or TikTok. It was a major wake-up call.\n\nSo I became diligent about tapping my phone to the little Brick every morning, leaving the square in my fiancé's office so I wouldn't be tempted. The effect was almost immediate.\n\nI was barely picking up my phone during work hours and feeling far less drained after each day, no doubt thanks in part to quieting the constant stream of notifications. Even when I wasn't using Brick on the weekends, I was checking TikTok and Instagram way less.\n\nI still have plenty of work to do when it comes to untethering myself from the grips of social media, but Brick is definitely helping.\n\nIn fact, I'm using it right now.",

    "fullText": "Back in the 1980s, rotisserie chicken may have existed, but it was not a staple in the way it has become today.\n\nCostco, for example, which has become well-known for selling an entire rotisserie chicken for $4.99, did not actually start selling the popular item until 1994.\n\n\"The famous $4.99 chicken made its official Costco debut in 1994. Aside from a brief dollar increase in 2008 during the Great Recession, Costco has remained committed to keeping the chicken’s price steady despite ongoing inflation,\" according to Eat This, Not That.\n\nThe warehouse club actually loses money selling its popular chicken. But Rose Sioson, founder of Deliciously Rushed and an avid Costco shopper, thinks Costco more than makes up for it just by getting customers through the door for that value chicken.\n\n“Costco may technically lose money on each rotisserie chicken they sell, but trust me —they’re not losing when it comes to what I buy next,” Sioson told. “That chicken usually ends up in a cart with salad kits, ready-made mashed potatoes, a bottle of wine, maybe a dessert, and some random item I had zero intention of buying. It’s classic Costco strategy.”\n\nWhen a major retailer sells your core product as a loss leader, that's never great for business, but that's only one reason why Boston Market has been pushed to the edge of being fully out of existence.\n\nWhen I was a child growing up outside of Boston in the 1980s, my aunt used to visit, and she often brought a chicken from what was then known as Boston Chicken. At the time, the company was a small local chain that was actually founded in a Boston suburb.\n\nThis was the first time I had been exposed to rotisserie chicken, and the concept quickly took off. McDonald's was even an investor for a brief period.\n\nPeak footprint: Boston Market once had over 1,200 U.S. restaurants at its national height in the 1990s.\n The drop from 1,200 to 300 took place from the late '90s to 2023.\n\n2023-2024 decline: The chain shrank precipitously from 300 locations at the start of 2023 to fewer than 30 by early 2024, according to Restaurant Business Online.\n\nEarly 2025 footprint: Estimates indicate fewer than 20 locations remain open nationally in early 2025, with many stores disappearing without notice, a stark collapse from its former scale, added Flavor365.\n\nFluid numbers: Official company listings on websites and apps significantly overstate open stores; many listed units are confirmed closed, reported Restaurant Business Online.",

    "description": "Amazon rolls out an updated dashboard for managers to track office attendance and hours, expanding strict RTO policies.",
    "fullText": "What kind of badger are you? Amazon managers are about to find out.\n\nAmazon is equipping its managers with powerful new metrics to monitor their reports with a dashboard that tracks not only whether employees show up to the office, but also how many hours they spend there, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe move marks an escalation in the surveillance of white-collar workers at the e-commerce and cloud computing giant. Last year, Amazon implemented one of the industry's most stringent RTO mandates, requiring most employees to work from an office for five days a week. Now, managers have a way to spot — and potentially confront — employees who fall short of these expectations.\n\nThe updated dashboard, which began rolling out in December, allows managers and HR to view how often employees come into an office, how long they stay, and the locations where they work. It refreshes at 5 p.m. PT daily and tracks these metrics over a rolling eight-week period.\n\nThe system flags three kinds of employees: \"Low-Time Badgers,\" defined as employees whose weekly median time in the office is less than four hours per day, averaged over a rolling eight-week period; \"Zero Badgers,\" who don't badge into any Amazon building during that span; and \"Unassigned Building Badgers,\" who badge into a building other than the one they're assigned to over half the time.\n\n\"These metrics are intended to surface employees operating significantly outside documented in-office expectations,\" the document says.\n\n\"For more than a year now, we've provided tools like this for managers to help identify who on their team may need support in working from the office each day,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. \"We recently updated the dashboard to make it more consistent for all managers, but most of the data and functionality was previously available. We continue to see the benefits of having our teams working together, and we haven't changed our expectations for employees to be in the office.\"\n\nAmazon notes in the document that managers are expected to \"apply judgment\" when determining whether to initiate formal disciplinary follow-ups.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon began tracking and sharing individual office attendance records, reversing a previous policy that only tracked anonymized, aggregated attendance data.\n\nA year later, the company began cracking down on \"coffee badging\" by informing some teams that they needed to be in the office for a minimum of two to six hours to have their attendance count. The crackdown received criticism from some employees, including one who compared the move to being treated \"like high school students,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe updated dashboard standardizes these metrics across Amazon's entire corporate workforce, excluding workers such as warehouse staff and contractors. It grants managers direct, on-demand access to data that they would have previously had to request from HR, according to an Amazon employee familiar with the company's policies.\n\nAmazon is positioning the dashboard as a means to encourage in-person collaboration.\n\n\"Working In-office is important to our culture and is also about more than just being physically present during the week,\" the document said. \"Managers are expected to promote meaningful team collaboration through direct interactions with their team rather than just remotely monitoring badge swipes each week.\"\n\nAmazon is hardly alone in using badge data to police return-to-office rules.\n\nSamsung rolled out a manager-facing tool that shows \"days and time in building\" metrics, aimed at discouraging \"lunch/coffee badging.\" Dell informed hybrid staff that it will track on-site presence via badge swipes and could factor attendance into performance and compensation.\n\nBank of America issued warning notices to employees, informing some that continued noncompliance with its RTO policy could result in further disciplinary action. At JPMorgan, employees have described an internal dashboard that calculates the share of eligible days spent in the office and is visible to senior managers.\n\nIn the UK, PwC has said it would track employees' work locations to enforce its RTO policy.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Former Vice President Mike Pence has issued a dire warning that Donald Trump will be impeached if Democrats win this year’s midterm elections.\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s The Source with Kaitlan Collins, Pence said he agreed with Trump’s assessment that Democrats would find a “reason to impeach” should they retake control of the House, and possibly even the Senate, in November’s nationwide elections.\n\n“I think it’s very likely,” Pence said. “I mean, they impeached the president for a phone call when we were in office, and I expect it in this highly divided, partisan town.”\n\nPence’s relationship with Trump fell apart in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021. In the weeks leading up to the riot, Trump repeatedly and falsely suggested that Pence had the power to refuse to certify the 2020 election results.\n\nHe then blamed Pence for the certification of Joe Biden’s win, leading to supporters directing their ire at the outgoing vice president during the Capitol riot with chants to “hang Mike Pence!”\n\nTrump later became the first U.S. president in history to be impeached for a second time after being accused of inciting the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nTrump was first impeached in 2019 after allegedly threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, ahead of the 2020 election. Trump was acquitted by the Senate both times.\n\nDemocrats are widely predicted to post significant victories in November’s midterms. Historically, the party in power suffers heavy losses—particularly in the House—and Trump’s turbulent second term, marked by a struggling economy, is expected to fuel voter backlash.\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans on Tuesday, Trump issued a blunt warning about what could happen if the GOP loses control of the House.\n\n“You gotta win the midterms,” he said. “Because if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be—I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me. I’ll get impeached.”\n\nDuring his appearance on CNN’s The Source, Pence also suggested that Trump’s attack on Venezuela without congressional approval—and the unprecedented capture of its former leader, Nicolás Maduro—could become a liability for the remainder of Trump’s time in the White House.\n\nThe former vice president added that Americans are now longing for a “return to those timeless principles and values that really united the country.”\n\n“The year that Ronald Reagan won 49 states, they were the very same principles that President Trump and I governed on,” Pence said. “And whatever time I have left remaining in the public debate, I’m going to continue to be a consistent advocate for that broad, mainstream conservative agenda.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "description": "A virtually blank resume may spook employers, but job candidates don’t need a lengthy work career to land a gig—after all, one of Steven Bartlett’s best hires only had two lines on her CV.",
    "fullText": "Job-seekers may believe that an Ivy League degree or Fortune 500 work experience will land them a gig—but who they thank while walking into an interview could be more important than their educational pedigree.\n\nSteven Bartlett, the founder and host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, took a chance on an applicant with a virtually blank CV for that very reason.\n\n“I hired someone who’s CV was two lines. Their experience was zero,” Bartlett explained in a recent LinkedIn post. “Much of the reason why I gave her the job was because: She thanked the security guard by name on the way into the building.”\n\nShe continued to prove herself during the hiring process in seemingly small ways too—and those acts of humility got her the job, not her credentials.\n\n“When she didn’t know something, in the interview she said ‘I don’t know that yet, but here’s how I’d figure it out,’” Bartlett explained. “After the interview she went and self-taught herself the answer she didn’t know, and emailed it to me within hours.”\n\nThe founder took a chance on the experience-less candidate, and it didn’t take long to pay off; Bartlett said that six months later, she has proved herself as one of the best hires he’s ever made. “Fifteen years of hiring has taught me that culture fit and character is MUCH harder to hire than experience, skills or education.”\n\nBartlett’s hiring philosophy is music to the ears of entry-level Gen Zers kickstarting their careers without full-time work on their resumes.\n\nIt has long been the rule of thumb that the candidate with the best degree, most work experience, and impressive credentials will come out of job interview rounds victorious. But with years of successful and failed hires under their belt, bosses are bucking the status quo and chasing talent with human skills, work ethic, and integrity.\n\nDavid Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, isn’t drawn to candidates with the highest IQ. Instead, he said he’s in the “camp of smart enough” when hiring talent at the $282 billion company; in lieu of focusing on educational pedigree, he gravitates towards applicants who are in touch with “human elements” including the ability to connect, be resilient, and determined. Experience is also “hugely underrated” and a “big differentiator for the firm,” Solomon noted. Attending Harvard University or being the brightest in the room may be impressive, but it won’t get job candidates far at the banking titan.\n\n“You have to be smart enough, but the smartest person in the world without a whole package of other things [is] not going to navigate Goldman Sachs well, not going to be successful in Goldman Sachs over the long run,” Solomon revealed on Sequoia Capital’s Long Strange Trip podcast last year. “You can’t teach experience.”\n\nAnd Danny Meyer, the founder of global fast-casual chain Shake Shack, couldn’t agree more. To run the company’s 510 restaurant locations like a well-oiled machine, he needs talent to have a high “hospitality quotient” (HQ) over IQ. And he’s searching for six green flags in Shake Shack talent: integrity, optimism, intellectual curiosity, work ethic, empathy, and self-awareness.\n\n“I really don’t give a damn what your IQ is,” Meyer told Fortune’s Jason Del Rey at the Qualtrics X4 Summit last year. “What an IQ basically says is one’s aptitude for learning. What HQ is, is the degree to which someone is happier themselves when they provide happiness for someone else.”\n\nEven the Oracle of Omaha and longtime Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has fine-tuned his own hiring philosophy. After more than five decades helming the $1 trillion holding company, Buffett has witnessed professionals without glitzy Ivy League degrees succeed. And in planning his CEO succession last year, the investing mogul made one point clear: he wasn’t going to check the education section on candidates’ resumes.\n\n“I never look at where a candidate has gone to school. Never!” Buffett wrote in his 2025 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. “Of course, there are great managers who attended the most famous schools. But there are plenty such as Pete who may have benefited by attending a less prestigious institution or even not bothering to finish school.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

In that span, Paramount went through several corporate changes, from a ViacomCBS merger to the Paramount Skydance merger that closed in the summer of 2025.\n\n\"What we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message. \"But we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver.\"\n\nHou's Slack message was received warmly, with 118 \"care\" emojis, 67 classic \"red heart\" emojis, and 43 \"thank you\" emojis, among other signals of support as of early Thursday afternoon.\n\nSince Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison took over in early August, he's made several noteworthy moves, like landing UFC rights in the US and hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News.\n\nSeveral top executives have left the company as Ellison has taken control, including co-CEOs Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins, streaming head Tom Ryan, and international markets head Pam Kaufman.\n\nEllison is now focused on buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which has rejected its takeover offer eight times.\n\nParamount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead Hou's Slack message to colleagues announcing the move:\n\nAs Dane shared in his note, I'll be transitioning out of my role and leaving the company at the end of January. After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next.\n\nWhat we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy — but we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver. Yet again and again, this team showed grit, creativity, and passion. Whether you came from Pluto or another part of Streaming, the story is the same: we took on impossible problems and innovated our way through.\n\nThe culture we live — being curious about everything, feeling that hunger to solve problems, caring deeply for others, iterating constantly, and innovating in everything we do — belongs to all of you now. You should be proud of what you've achieved, and you should be confident that this is a team that can handle anything thrown its way.\n\nAs to the future, I have a lot of confidence in Dane and the vision and strategic pillars he's laid out for the year ahead. They set a strong foundation for where this organization can go over the next several years, and I'm excited to see what you all do together under his leadership.\n\nI plan to hold my last open office hours next Friday so anyone who wants to drop in, ask questions, or just say hello/goodbye has a space to do that together. In the meantime, if you'd like to stay in touch beyond my time here, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nServing alongside you has been one of the great privileges of my life, and I'll be proudly cheering you on as you write the next chapter together.",

The manager, which manages $22 billion, declined to comment.\n\nMacro hedge funds had a strong 2025 thanks to a choppy geopolitical environment caused by, among other things, President Donald Trump's tariff policies and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\nBridgewater Associates had its most profitable year ever, Business Insider previously reported, with gains of 33% in its flagship Pure Alpha fund. Rob Citrone's Discovery Capital was up more than 35%.\n\nRokos's former firm, Brevan Howard, lagged the macro pack, Business Insider reported. The firm's two largest funds, Master and Alpha Strategies, returned 0.8% and 8%, respectively.\n\nRokos, in a way, is a throwback to a previous iteration of the hedge fund industry, which was dominated by big star traders instead of the multistrategy managers that have come to rule the space.\n\nHe accounts for most of the risk-taking, Business Insider previously reported, and raised fees this past summer that give the firm a quarter of the trading profits generated.\n\nMacro funds are expected to have another strong year. Evanston Capital, an asset manager that invests in hedge funds, put out a report stating that the \"protectionism\" of the Trump administration and other nations \"will lead to more varied economic conditions across countries.\"\n\nBecause of this shift, there will be \"a richer set of prospective trades for skilled macro managers, especially those that can optimize trade expressions across directional, relative value, and volatility dimensions.\"",

    "title": "The old food pyramid vs. RFK Jr's 'New Pyramid': See how the guidelines have evolved over time",
    "description": "The USDA first published guidance in 1980, then a food pyramid in 1992 and a 2011 \"MyPlate\" version. Here's how they stack up to RFK's new pyramid.",
    "fullText": "For 46 years, the government has been trying to give us advice on how to eat better.\n\nIn 1980, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans were introduced, after lawmakers took notice of how some modern eating habits were fueling a rise in chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.\n\nThe very first guidelines looked like they were torn from a recipe book and were very basic principles.\n\nThe first guidelines didn't give people any visual aids for how to plan their daily diet, only prioritizing that people eat a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits and veggies, whole grains, dairy, meat, eggs, and beans.\n\n\"You need about 40 different nutrients to stay healthy,\" the guidelines said. \"Most foods contain more than one nutrient. Milk, for example, provides proteins, fats, sugars, riboflavin and other B-vitamins, vitamin A, calcium, and phosphorus — among other nutrients.\" But it doesn't have much iron or vitamin C. \"You should, therefore, eat a variety of foods to assure an adequate diet.\"\n\nIn 1992, 34 years ago, the US released its first food pyramid, giving people more specific guidance about how much to eat each day:\n\nHere, grains like bread, cereal, rice, and pasta were touted as the foundation of a balanced diet — the recommendation in the chart was six to 11 servings of grains per day.\n\nThe second priority, you were told, was to add in at least two to three servings of fruits and veggies each day.\n\nFinally, layer on top some protein from meat, eggs, beans, and nuts, as well as dairy.\n\nFat and sugar, which comprise more than a third of the typical American diet, were a side note.\n\nNutrition experts widely agree that six to 11 servings of bread per day is too much, crowding out space in your stomach for other important nutrients. Plus, they say, it's not just which food groups you eat, but the quality of each: whole grains are better than white bread, nuts and olive oil healthier fats than lard or bacon.\n\nDuring the first Obama administration, in 2011, the government introduced \"My Plate,\" which was meant to simplify our nutrition advice, but only added confusion, with four incredibly generic quadrants of a plate.\n\nThe portions of \"vegetables\" and \"grains\" were slightly larger than those of \"fruits\" and \"protein,\" and a glass of \"dairy\" was served on the side.\n\nCritics said this nutrition advice was oversimplified, with no mention of healthy versus unhealthy foods, no mention of portion sizes, and no room for diverse diets. After all, a \"grain\" could be a donut, or it could be some oatmeal.\n\nStill, nutritionists say a more specific version of this kind of \"plate method,\" trying to make roughly half of your plate vegetables and the other half a solid mix of carbs and protein, is a halfway decent diet strategy.\n\nThe Trump Administration released its 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans on Wednesday, a document that will guide federal nutrition policy for schoolchildren and military cafeterias, and also serves as a consumer's guide to healthier eating.\n\nThe big tagline this time is \"eat real food,\" a motto meant to encourage people to consume less ultra-processed foods, skip added sugar, and eat more whole foods.\n\n\"I agree entirely that we should eat real food,\" Professor Joan Sabaté, a nutrition expert who was one of the independent scientific advisors for the former 2020-2025 edition of the Dietary Guidelines, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Eat real food is an outstanding message. Yes. Reduce or eliminate highly processed foods, I think, is a good message. Reduce sugar is a good message,\" he said.\n\nSabaté is less thrilled with how the pyramid is designed to prominently favor red meat as the cornerstone of any healthy diet.\n\n\"Our eyes, when we have a document, or we have a screen in front of us, move from left to right and from top to bottom,\" he said. \"So the way this pyramid has been designed is that the first food that you see in the top left corner is beef.\"\n\nMeat can be part of a healthy diet, he said, but it shouldn't be so prominent.\n\n\"The scientific consensus is that plant-based diets are the healthiest diets as far as preventing chronic diseases. And there is no new evidence saying that animal-based diets are better for health and preventing diseases. There is no evidence of that,\" he said. \"People can also consume animal products, but they shouldn't be the majority of the energy on the plate.\"\n\n(The experts who helped draft these guidelines have disclosed ties to the beef and dairy industries.)\n\nOlive oil is a healthier fat than butter or beef tallow. Nuts are a great snack. Sabaté has concerns about kidney issues and cholesterol if people shun healthy carbs like oats, whole-grain bread, or quinoa, in favor of more meat and dairy.\n\n\"This pyramid, it prompts the American public to eat more animal products,\" he said.",

    "description": "Christopher Nolan's follow-up to \"Oppenheimer\" is an adaptation of Homer's epic \"The Odyssey,\" starring Matt Damon as Odysseus. Here's what we know.",
    "fullText": "After \"Oppenheimer\" was a critical and commercial hit, Christopher Nolan is adapting Homer's Greek epic poem \"The Odyssey\" for his next film.\n\nUniversal Pictures announced the movie in late 2024, saying it would be shot using \"brand new IMAX film technology\" and that it would arrive in theaters on July 17, 2026.\n\nHere's everything we know about the film so far.\n\nAyomikun Adekaiyero and Eve Crosbie previously contributed to this post.\n\nHomer is the attributed author of two ancient Greek poems that were composed in the 8th or 7th century BC, both of which tell the story of the Trojan War.\n\n\"The Iliad\" narrates the end of the war, while \"The Odyssey\" tells of Odysseus' 10-year struggle to return to his island home of Ithaca.\n\nDuring the journey, Odysseus and his crew fight against a man-eating cyclops, powerful giants, and sirens. They defeat witches and sea monsters, and anger the gods Zeus and Poseidon. But Odysseus has one god, Athena, on his side, trying to help him get home.\n\nMeanwhile, a band of suitors are trying to take over Odysseus' kingdom in Ithaca, supplanting his son Telemachus and convincing Penelope to marry one of them.\n\nIn a dramatic conclusion, Odysseus disguises himself as a beggar and sneaks back onto the island, where he observes the actions of the suitors before reclaiming his family and kingdom.\n\nThis will be Nolan's first film about Greek mythology, breaking away from his regular sci-fi and war films. Nolan also wrote the script.\n\nNolan's \"The Odyssey\" was partially filmed on the island of Favignana near Sicily, Variety reported.\n\nKnown in ancient times as Aegusa, or \"goat island,\" it's thought to be the inspiration for the fantastical island where Odysseus lands with his crew and stops to rest, barbecue goats, and drink wine before his run-in with the Cyclops.\n\nPer Variety, the scenes shot in Sicily are said to take up the bulk of the mythical action in the movie, while locations in the UK and Morocco are also being used.\n\nProduction wrapped in early August 2025.\n\nThat feat had previously been impossible because the cameras are extremely noisy.\n\nNolan, who has always loved shooting on IMAX, challenged the company to come up with a quieter camera. Damon told the \"New Heights\" podcast in January what it was like working with the new camera.\n\n\"IMAX cameras are really loud. It sounds like a blender, like a Cuisinart in your face when the camera's close to you,\" Damon told hosts Jason and Travis Kelce. So there's never been these dialogue [scenes in IMAX]. We couldn't have this conversation with a normal IMAX camera because you wouldn't be able to hear us.\"\n\n\"They built this giant thing around the IMAX for those dialogue scenes and a system of mirrors so your eye line would be close to the camera and you could talk to the other actor,\" Damon continued. \"The amount of work that went into figuring out how to do [that], because he wanted to do 100 percent IMAX, and he did it!\"\n\nSeveral filmmakers have brought Homer's work to screen over the years, including the Oscar-winning Coen brothers and Oscar-nominated German director Wolfgang Petersen.\n\nPetersen's \"Troy,\" which premiered in 2004 and starred Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom, was based on Homer's \"The Illiad.\" It was the most commercially successful Homer adaptation, grossing $497 million worldwide. However, it received mixed reviews, with some criticizing it for not translating Homer's story well. The film holds a 53% Tomatometer rating on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nPitt told The New York Times Magazine in 2019 that he was \"disappointed\" by the film, and the experience made him pivot toward \"quality stories\" for the rest of his career.\n\nThe Coen Brothers' \"O Brother, Where Are Thou?\" and the 2004 \"The Spongebob Squarepants Movie\" are two other Hollywood that are movies loosely based on \"The Odyssey.\"\n\nHomer's work has also been adapted into multiple TV series, including 1997's \"The Odyssey,\" which starred Christopher Lee and Vanessa Williams.\n\nThe most recent adaptation was \"The Return,\" directed by Italian filmmaker Uberto Pasolini and starring Ralph Fiennes as Odysseus. The film, which is a retelling of the final sections of the epic poem, received positive reviews from critics but made less than $1 million worldwide.",

    "title": "Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page moved an LLC out of California ahead of proposed billionaire's tax",
    "description": "The LLC moved as California's ultrarich weigh leaving ahead of a proposed tax on billionaires that would take effect retroactively starting January 1.",
    "fullText": "An entity tied to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page moved out of California at the end of 2025, beating the deadline on a proposed wealth tax of the state's rich and powerful.\n\nT-Rex LLC, formed in 2006 and linked to Brin and Page, converted out of California into a Delaware LLC called T-Rex Holdings on December 24, 2025, according to a California filing reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior filings over the past 20 years listed Brin and Page as managers of the LLC at a Palo Alto address. In the conversion filing, T-Rex Holdings listed an address in Reno, Nevada, as its principal office, with Brin and Page both remaining managers.\n\nRepresentatives for Brin and Page didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes as California's wealthiest residents are weighing whether to leave the state. A proposed ballot measure would make the roughly 200 California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion pay a one-time 5% tax. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. The measure attempts to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nEarlier this week, Business Insider first reported that Page severed ties with California in late December by converting his family office out of the state and incorporating it in Delaware. He has also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures.\n\nIt's unclear what the entity tied to Brin and Page does. The filing describes T-Rex Holdings as a \"management company.\" Like other ultrawealthy executives, Brin and Page have used LLCs as flexible vehicles to hold assets or manage investments, often with little public disclosure. The LLC's name may be a reference to Stan, a bronze T. rex statue that presides over Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nBrin, who cofounded Google with Page in 1998, is associated with several other entities in California, including the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and Bayshore Global Management, which acts as his family office. Filings do not show any other entity associated with Brin leaving California.\n\nPage and Brin are, respectively, the second and fourth-richest people on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Each has a net worth exceeding $250 billion.\n\nAfter stepping back from executive roles in 2019, the two have taken differing paths. Brin has returned to hands-on work at Google. Page is a controlling shareholder, but has remained outside the company's daily operations.\n\nIf the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November. If approved by voters, it will apply retroactively to the beginning of the year, meaning those who wish to avoid the tax would need to have been out of the state by the end of December 2025.\n\nCalifornia law determines residency based a variety of factors, including time spent in California and any substantial business dealings.\n\nA December 11 letter from celebrity attorney Alex Spiro to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, seen by Business Insider, urged the governor to stop the proposed tax: \"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"",

    "title": "What Trump's plan to ban defense dividends and raise the military budget could mean for your portfolio",
    "description": "Defense stocks pay relatively high dividends, but there are alternative areas of the market for investors to consider if they want steady income.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump sent defense stocks on a roller coaster ride this week, and his recent executive orders on defense firms and his calls for more defense spending could impact investors' portfolios.\n\nThe president signed an order aimed at restricting some financial behavior among defense contractors, including an executive order that bans defense firms from issuing dividend payments and doing stock buybacks until they deliver a \"superior product.\" Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that he wants the US military budget could raised to a record $1.5 trillion next year.\n\nBoth developments have implications for investors who have money in the defense sector, which is known for paying relatively high dividends. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has an annual dividend yield of around 2%, compared to about 1% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere's the rundown of how investors should be thinking about the latest news — and what it means for their portfolios.\n\nFor the most part, investors shouldn't be thinking about their long-term investments too differently. Trump's push to ban dividend payments seems largely hypothetical, and it's unclear how the president will enforce such a rule, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"It feels as though this was making another random social media announcement that will likely die on the vine,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I don't know you need to make a rush to judgment in terms of changing your long-term investment plans.\"\n\nBesides the threat of barring dividend payments, Trump's announcements on social media seem largely positive for defense investors, José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. He added that those who aren't dependent on dividend payments should remain invested in the sector, pointing to the potential for growth.\n\n\"I think that investors can look forward to improved quality from those companies, in the best-case scenario,\" he told BI.\n\nIf defense companies fall in line and pause dividend payments, that could hurt investors who specifically hold dividend-paying stocks for regular income, Torres said.\n\nBut those investors can move to other dividend-paying areas of the market. Torres encouraged investors to consider value sectors with high dividend yields, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nB. Riley's Hogan encouraged investors to consider areas like energy, consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and other parts of the industrial sector, a broader umbrella that covers defense stocks.\n\nDividend ETFs, which track a basket of dividend-paying companies, are also an option for investors chasing dividends, he added.\n\n\"There's a lot of dividend darlings for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I think investors, if in fact they feel nervous about the potential for dividend cuts or the removal of dividends in any space, as unlikely as that prospect seems, there are ways to navigate around that.\"\n\nInvestors should be watching their bond investments, Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said.\n\nBerezin said that the significant increase in defense spending could lead to a rise in bond yields, which would mean bond prices could fall.\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also said he believed bond investors should \"absolutely\" be concerned about the more robust military budget, which could raise long-end bond yields in particular.\n\nLong-end bond yields have climbed in recent years as concerns have risen about the US deficit and rising levels of government debt. Higher debt levels make investors more wary of purchasing long-term US Treasurys, which means yields need to rise to attract investors. Heavy borrowing and spending are also inflationary, which could push yields higher down the road as the central bank adjusts monetary policy to keep prices under control.\n\nTorres didn't recommend selling bonds at the moment. He believes concerns around debt have caused long-end bond yields in the US to be \"too high,\" and he expects those yields to ease soon.\n\n\"I'm a bond bull at this juncture,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump took aim at defense contractors on Wednesday in an executive order.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is targeting the bank accounts of defense contractor CEOs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order outlining new rules for defense contractors that would ban stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget\" — as well as limit executive compensation.\n\nThe order stipulates that in future contracts, if the Secretary of War were unsatisfied with a company's performance, executive base salaries would be capped at current levels. Future contracts would also ensure compensation \"not be tied to short-term financial metrics\" and instead be \"linked to an on-time delivery, increased production, and all necessary facilitation of investments and operating improvements.\"\n\nThe goal, per the executive order, is to increase the speed of innovation at defense companies, rather than focus on corporate profits.\n\nTrump also took aim at the leaders of defense contractors in a series of posts on Truth Social on Wednesday.\n\n\"Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military,\" Trump wrote. \"Salaries, Stock Options, and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives.\"\n\nHe proposed that no executive should earn \"in excess of $5 million\" until their production speed and maintenance improve, though the executive order did not cap pay at that exact amount.\n\nThe leaders of the big five defense contractors — Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly known as Raytheon), Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics — each earned more than $18 million in total compensation in 2024, the most recent year for which data is available. Their total income was a combination of salary, incentives, stock options, and other forms of compensation, including the value of security services and changes in the value of pension funds.\n\nWhile exceeding the $5 million cap proposed by Trump by magnitudes, the CEOs' compensation pales in comparison to that of some other business leaders.\n\nDozens of CEOs earned more than them in 2024. James Robert Anderson, who runs materials manufacturer Coherent, had a pay package of more than $100 million last year. The CEOs of Starbucks, GE, and Microsoft each made more than $75 million.\n\nExecutive pay and stock transactions are part of Trump's larger plans for the military. On Wednesday evening, he said on Truth Social that America's military budget should be increased to $1.5 trillion in 2027, up from the record 2026 defense budget of $901 billion.\n\nThat sent defense stocks climbing on Thursday morning, gaining back what they'd lost following the signing of the executive order.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider regarding the order, a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin said the company \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nBoeing and General Dynamics declined to comment, and Northrop Grumman and RTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Tin Can, the \"landline\" for kids, got 100 times its normal call volume on Christmas. It crashed. Kids were upset. Now, it's almost back to normal.",
    "fullText": "The Tin Can phone, a \"landline\" designed for kids, is having growing pains.\n\nIt's become so popular that its service crashed on Christmas, leaving kids upset that they couldn't make calls on the gifts they'd just opened under the tree.\n\nTin Can has emailed customers at least three times since the holiday hiccup with updates on fixes in the works.\n\n\"Call volume on Christmas Day increased more than 100x from the start of the month, which impacted people's abilities to set up their devices or make calls,\" Tin Can founder Chet Kittleson told Business Insider. \"Despite spending months and months preparing for it, we didn't get it all right.\"\n\nMost services are back up and running, he said. But there are still some issues with call quality and reliability. \"This is our biggest priority and the full team is working around the clock to restore service,\" he said.\n\nThe buzzy phone was launched in the fall of 2024 and spread quickly through word of mouth — especially in Facebook groups focused on parenting. The phones, which are colorful and corded, cost $75. It's free to call other Tin Can users (or you can pay $10 a month to call outside lines, similar to VoIP), which is what makes the service so popular with parents: They can create a sort of Tin Can closed circuit.\n\nFor Maria Pahuja, a parent in Richmond, Virginia, everything was working fine when she installed the Tin Can phone on Christmas Eve morning. \"It worked great, the kids were using it,\" she said. \"Then, Christmas morning, it stopped working.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you'd pick it up, and there would be a dial tone, you would call, and nothing would happen. Once in a while, a call would go through, and then two minutes later another call wouldn't,\" she said. \"It wasn't consistent.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Conz Preti bought a Tin Can for her kids in the fall and is a big fan of it. She was delighted how, on a recent snow day, her kids used it to organize playdates for sledding — all on their own, without the parents having to act as social secretary.\n\n(Full disclosure: I have also ordered one for my own kids. In a nod to what the company said is a paced timeline to make sure it can catch up with any tech issues, mine isn't scheduled to arrive until February.)\n\nThe concept of the Tin Can is appealing to parents like Conz and me, who have kids too young for cellphones but are old enough to want to communicate with friends on their own. Although it's similar to an actual landline, it's not one: Tin Can works on WiFi. Parents can set it to make and receive calls only to and from approved contacts. And it can also be programmed to have a time limit and be silent during quiet hours.\n\nThe company was founded by Kittleson, Max Blumen, and Graeme Davies based on a desire to create something for their own kids. They raised $3.5 million in funding for the company from investors, including Pioneer Square Ventures, Newfund Capital, Mother Ventures, and Solid Foundation. Since December 2025, they have raised an additional $12 million from Greylock Partners, bringing the total to $15.5 million, the company said.\n\nIn late August 2025, Kittleson told Business Insider they had sold \"tens of thousands\" of the devices so far. The company didn't have an updated sales figure to share.\n\nEven the disappointment of the tech issues with the phone is a teaching moment, one parent said.\n\n\"Part of what we're trying to teach kids is patience and accountability,\" said Joy Engel, a parent of a 5- and 8-year-old who lives outside Portland, Maine. She received the Tin Can she ordered over the summer on the first day of Hannukkah, and her kids have loved it, even with the service outages in late December.\n\n\"The company has been so forthright in what they say and how they've communicated and stopped charging people. That's accountability,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a patience there that you're teaching them that you can't always get what you want right now. ''Your friend's not there, that stinks. You're gonna have to wait and call them back. The phone doesn't work. That stinks. You're going to have to wait and try again,\" she said.\n\nFor now, the Tin Can is backordered until April. Not because of manufacturing constraints, Kittleson told Business Insider, but to pace the onboarding of the service.\n\nUpdate: January 8, 2026 — Tin Can in December raised an additional $12 million, to bring its total fundraise to $15.5 million, the company said",

    "description": "DramaBox, a top micro-drama app, is looking to raise fresh funding as the short-video format gains popularity.",
    "fullText": "The battle to become the top micro-drama app in the US is heating up.\n\nDramaBox, one of the leading producers of the short-video format filled with soapy tropes, has been seeking fresh funding from US backers, according to two people with direct knowledge of its efforts.\n\nOne said DramaBox's fundraising goal was $100 million with a $500 million valuation.\n\nDramaBox is part of Singapore-based StoryMatrix, and is behind titles like \"A Deal with the Hockey Captain\" and \"The Lost Heir: A Christmas Reckoning\" that it monetizes through one-off payments, subscriptions (usually $20 a week), and ads.\n\nDramaBox did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nExecutives at DramaBox told Business Insider in September that the company was profitable and that their ambition was to become the most popular micro-drama platform for Americans. They aimed to do so by working with Hollywood filmmakers and diversifying into new storytelling styles and genres, such as series for families and choose-your-own-adventure-style dramas.\n\nIndustry reports regularly list DramaBox as one of the top two micro-drama apps, alongside fellow Asian import ReelShort. Analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated that DramaBox generated $120 million in global in-app revenue in the first quarter of 2025, just behind ReelShort's $130 million. DramaBox countered in the September interview that its numbers were higher, without sharing specifics.\n\nThe streaming consulting firm Owl & Co. estimated that the format had generated $1.3 billion in the US in 2025, mostly from direct payments from viewers.\n\nDramaBox already has a connection to Hollywood's most blue-chip company, Disney, which has invested in DramaBox through its selective accelerator program. Disney said in late 2025 that it was in talks with DramaBox to adapt young adult fantasy novels into original micro dramas and was exploring adapting music albums into vertical short videos.\n\nInvestors have been placing bets elsewhere in the space as well:\n\nMeta's Instagram is testing the micro drama format in India with a series. TikTok, which is already widely used by short dramas for marketing, added a section called TikTok Minis where you can binge on bite-sized series without leaving the app.\n\nDespite the format's burgeoning popularity, there are those who question its long-term viability. Some investors told Business Insider they had held back from the space because of concerns that the format wouldn't succeed in areas beyond its core of female-targeted romances.",

    "title": "Trump says he is instructing 'representatives' to buy $200 billion in mortgage bond in an effort to push down rates",
    "description": "Trump said Thursday that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, aiming to lower interest rates and monthly payments.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, arguing the move would lower interest rates and monthly housing payments.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said the directive was possible because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have \"$200 billion in cash.\" He added the bond purchases would help \"make the cost of owning a home more affordable.\"\n\nIt was not clear who Trump meant by his \"representatives,\" or which entity would carry out the purchases. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.\n\nTrump's proposal for his representatives to buy housing bonds comes on the heels of a Wednesday statement made by the president, in which he said he would ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that many housing economists say such a ban would do little to improve national housing affordability. It is unclear what effect Trump's latest proposal would have on the market.\n\nRichard Green, director and chair of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, told Business Insider that Trump's proposal doesn't go far enough to solve the fundamental problem with American housing, which is that there simply aren't enough homes for each person who wants to buy one.\n\nHowever, he added, even the $200 billion proposal is more symbolic than substantive.\n\n\"When the Fed was involved in buying mortgages, they were buying trillions, right? So this is a gesture, I suppose,\" Green said. \"And of course, if you drop interest rates down, it will show up at higher house prices, which means that down payment becomes more difficult.\"\n\n\"So it's not like magic, that if you push down mortgage interest rates, that you're going to make housing less or more affordable,\" Green added. \"But the big thing is that $200 billion sounds like a big number, but in context, it's not all that much.\"\n\nTrump's plan also came just a day after he signed an executive order that bans defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends unless they meet certain standards.\n\nThe approach fits with a broader shift in Trump's second-term economic playbook, as previously reported by Business Insider's Emily Stewart. The Trump administration seems to have embraced a more interventionist style of capitalism, with the federal government taking a more active role in markets, including holding direct stakes in private companies.\n\nTrump's latest rhetoric also appears to target the affordability crisis as frustration over prices builds and as midterm elections near.\n\nHousing, food, and everyday expenses remain stubbornly expensive since Trump took office for the second time, and his tariffs did not help. Zohran Mamdani, the new mayor of NYC, who had a meeting with Trump, notably won by running on universal childcare and affordable housing. According to a poll by Lake Research Partners in October 2025, support for affordability and living-wage policies in competitive swing districts is high and would give candidates who run on economic issues an advantage.",

Here's a look at all Fallout rewards in Call of Duty and how you unlock them during the event.\n\nCall of Duty's Fallout event runs from now until January 29. This adds operator skins and cosmetics themed around Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show. While there are plenty of free rewards to earn, you'll need to purchase the paid \"premium\" pass for 1,100 CoD Points ($10) if you want to unlock all items for the event.\n\nThere are 20 rewards in total for the Fallout event. There are 10 rewards in the free pass, and 10 more optional rewards can be unlocked with the paid pass. The highlights of the free pass include two vault dweller operator skins and the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun.

Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.\n\nAll Fallout event rewards can be seen below. This is an XP-based event, so you'll simply need to grind XP across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.

    "description": "Grand Theft Auto 6 is still a little over 10 months away, assuming its November 2026 release window holds. Earlier this week, GTA 6 watchers were unsettled when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that the game might not be as \"content complete\" as Rockstar has said in the past, and he didn't rule out another delay. Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments.\nDuring a recent appearance on the Button Mash podcast, Schreier said, \"The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete. That is to say people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels, and missions, and seeing what is going to make it into the game.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "OpenAI  invites you to hand over your medical information. Maybe don't?",
    "fullText": "This week, OpenAI announced its new ChatGPT Health feature, which will let users upload their medical records and ask health related questions. However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons.\n\nThe new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n\nCurrently, there's a waitlist to At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.",

    "title": "There's Actually a Way to Mix and Match Your Cordless Tool Batteries",
    "description": "Tool brands each have their own closed battery systems. You don't have to put up with that.",
    "fullText": "When shopping for cordless power tools, you'd think you could simply purchase the best option of each to fit your needs. But there's a big problem that makes this a lot harder (and more expensive) than it should be: battery incompatibility. By design, you can’t simply pop a Ryobi battery into a DeWalt tool and expect it to work. Engineering decisions aside, using proprietary batteries allows companies to create a sort of obligatory brand loyalty, forcing you to stick with their line of tools unless you want to invest in a whole new set of batteries for every new tool you buy.\n\nIf you've been building your cordless tool collection for some time, you may wind up with four or five different chargers and multiple batteries cluttering your workspace. And that clutter can be expensive, because you wind up buying more chargers and batteries than you might not need if batteries were interchangeable.\n\nBut it turns out they are, sort of. You can actually swap batteries between brands—you just need the right adapters.\n\nThere are two kinds of battery adapters to consider:\n\nInter-brand adapters allow you to use one brand’s batteries in another brand’s tool (like DeWalt batteries in Milwaukee tools).\n\nVoltage adapters allow you to use a different voltage battery than the tool expects (say, a 20-volt battery in a 18-volt tool).\n\nThese adapters are a fairly simple solution to the problem of incompatible battery systems. If you have a lot of DeWalt tools, for example, you can purchase a Milwaukee tool without a battery (which will be cheaper) and just use an adapter to plug in one of the DeWalt batteries you already have.\n\nOf course, these batteries weren’t specifically designed for these tools, so there can be some trade-offs. While tool performance has been found to be broadly similar (and some tools even performed better when using batteries from different brands), for some tools (like grinders and some circular saws) there’s a dropoff in power and performance when using an adapter. That said, you might not notice it if you're just looking to tackling simple DIY projects around the house.\n\nAnother caveat to consider: You might lose some features. Some tools are designed to communicate with the battery to modulate power draw in order to extend the life of the battery, and using an adapter will remove this functionality. But again, if you’re simply using a power drill for basic maintenance tasks, this might not be a huge issue for you.\n\nIf you’ve got a bunch of disparate tool brands, of course, buying multiple adapters might not seem like much of an improvement over your collection of batteries and chargers. If this is you, consider something like the Ceenr PDNation Universal Battery System, which provides an 18-volt battery and a series of adapters that allow it to be used in a wide range of power tools, including major brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee, and DeWalt.\n\nFor example, you can buy a battery with an adapter for DeWalt tools, then buy a second adapter for the same battery that will work with Makita tools. This means you can standardize on one battery system for pretty much any tool you buy (it’s not a truly universal system, since you’re dependent on the range of adapters they offer, but it’s probably close enough for most people).\n\nAs with other adapters, there can be some performance loss using a universal adapter, but by and large, it’s probably not a big issue if you’re doing work around the house, as opposed to working professionally on a job site.",

    "title": "Google's Getting Rid of a Way to Import Third-Party Accounts Into Gmail",
    "description": "This month, Gmail is ending POP support, which can break syncing your email from third-party accounts.",
    "fullText": "If you've been running several email accounts through your Gmail, you might want to double-check your settings this month—that's because Google is ending support for the POP3 protocol that can sync emails from third-party accounts. And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.\n\nPOP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.\n\nIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\n\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.\n\nUse IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.\n\nThe IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n\nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.",

    "title": "Use RICE to Prioritize Your To-Dos",
    "description": "The RICE method requires a little math, but it might be just the thing you need to tackle the new year.",
    "fullText": "Whenever you have a bunch of looming tasks—as many of us do at the start of the new year, when everyone actually \"circles back\" on the things we've been putting off—having a structured to-do list is an essential part of getting everything done. Determining what goes on that list and in what order, though, is a task all its own. I've covered a lot of ways to do that, but if you're stuck with a high volume of important responsibilities, you need an approach that matches the complexity of what you're trying to do—and that's where the RICE method comes into play.\n\nRICE, as you probably guessed, is an acronym. Here's what it stands for:\n\nReach: How many people or parts of your life or project this task will impact\n\nImpact: How meaningful that impact will be if and when it's done correctly\n\nConfidence: How sure you are about your estimates of the other three factors\n\nEffort: The time, energy, knowledge, and resources required\n\nA unique combination of those factors is going to give you guidance on which tasks are the most crucial to prioritize, which is helpful when you're overloaded by information and dread, unable to think about when or where to get started.\n\nI won't lie to you: This method is more convoluted than some of the others I've covered in the past. I might even recommend trying a simpler prioritization technique, like the Eisenhower matrix, before you try this one and only whip this out if Eisenhower or its peers aren't given you solid results. RICE takes a little time—and that's because you need to do some math.\n\nStart by writing down all your tasks. Under each, you're assigning numbers. The Reach score will be the number of people or parts of your life or project that the task will impact and the Impact score is a 3 (massive impact), 2 (high), 1 (medium), .5 (low), or .25 (minimal impact). Confidence should be a 100, 80, or 50, to represent the percentage of confidence you feel in your estimates and abilities. You can use any number between 0 and 100, but falling back on those three just makes it easier. Most adherents of this method use a complicated math equation (determining \"person-months\") for Effort, but I'm going to simplify that for you. Score it the same way you scored Impact, with a 3 for multiple days or resources, 2 for a day, 1 for half a day, .5 for an hour, and .25 for a half an hour or less. You can also score Reach that way if you're working on a personal project and your results won't necessarily reach a big number of people. In that case, think about the different areas of your life or personal goals it will affect and use that 3-to-.25 scale.\n\nThat part is all subjective, similar to using the ABCDE method to assign grades to your to-dos. It can't be avoided—you won't know the true resources required or reach of the project until it's done—but you can quantify it a bit.\n\nNext, you do math. It's R x I x C divided by E. You'll end up with a numerical score for each task. Rank the tasks in descending order, with the biggest numbers first. Obviously, you may find that some can't be completed until others are done, so use your discretion there, but for the most part, you've just created a clear outline of which things will have the biggest impact and reach and you can at least know where to start. Add each into your calendar using time boxing and time blocking, then get after it. Knowing you have a plan of attack is half the motivational battle.",

How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.\n\nJoe Root – 7 – Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.\n\nJamie Smith – 3 – Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?\n\nWill Jacks – 5 – Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?\n\nBrydon Carse – 6 – A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.\n\nMatthew Potts – 1 – Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.\n\nJosh Tongue – 7 – Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.\n\nMark Wood – 2 – A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?\n\nJofra Archer – 6 – Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.\n\nOllie Pope – 3 – Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.\n\nGus Atkinson – 3 – One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.\n\nShoaib Bashir – 0 – Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nThe Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction\n\nJake Weatherald – 4 – Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.\n\nTravis Head – 10 – The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.\n\nSteve Smith – 7 – Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 5 – A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.\n\nAlex Carey – 9 – One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.\n\nBeau Webster – 5 – When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.\n\nMichael Neser – 7 – Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.\n\nMitchell Starc – 10 – This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.\n\nScott Boland – 7 – Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.\n\nBrendan Doggett – 4 – Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.\n\nPat Cummins – 6 – Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.\n\nNathan Lyon – 4 – Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.\n\nJosh Inglis – 3 – Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.\n\nJhye Richardson – 2 – Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs. Should get another chance.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win",

    "fullText": "Ethan Nwaneri had a breakout season last term when the Arsenal forward deputised so impressively for the injured Bukayo Saka.\n\nHe played mostly on the right wing and scored nine goals in 37 appearances in all competitions to mark himself out as one of England's most talented young players.\n\nNwaneri, now 18, also became the second-youngest goalscorer in Champions League history when he netted against Girona last January at 17 years and 314 days old - only Jude Bellingham did so at a younger age.\n\nThe England Under-21 forward is the youngest player to feature in the Premier League thanks to a debut against Brentford at the age of 15 years and 181 days in September 2022.\n\nSo, as well as those admirable performances in 2024-25, it also feels as though Nwaneri has been on the first-team scene for a long time.\n\nYet this season, his involvement has been limited.\n\nNwaneri has made 11 appearances in all competitions, starting just three times across matches in the Carabao Cup and Champions League. He has played just 446 minutes and has scored one goal.\n\nThe Gunners spent about £250m bringing in eight players over the summer to increase the depth in their squad, with Martin Zubimendi, Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and even the younger Noni Madueke 'win now signings'.\n\nIt has worked, with Arsenal five points clear at the top of the Premier League and with a perfect record in the Champions League.\n\nMikel Arteta's side have won 23, drawn four and lost just two of their 29 matches and if they beat Liverpool in the league on Thursday, they will be eight points clear of Manchester City.\n\nBut those experienced signings, and Arsenal's success, has come at a cost to younger members of the squad like Nwaneri.",

    "fullText": "An influential Manchester United fan group is planning a protest against the ownership, which it accuses of \"turning the club into a circus\".\n\nThe 1958 group was responsible for protests at the way United was being run which attracted thousands in March last year - although they scrapped a plan to repeat it before the opening home game of this season against Arsenal.\n\nDiscontent against minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe been growing in recent weeks, and the appointment and subsequent dismissal of Ruben Amorim has triggered a call to protest before the Red Devils play Fulham on 1 February.\n\nFans held up an anti-Ratcliffe banner at Turf Moor on Wednesday before the 2-2 draw with Burnley, when supporters also sang vicious songs against co-chairman Joel Glazer.\n\n\"After lurching from one disaster to another, Ratcliffe comes across as an incompetent clown turning the club into a circus,\" said the 1958 group in a statement.\n\n\"Instead of best in class, we're a laughing stock.\n\n\"It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United. On the pitch, we are watching mediocre performances from an average team drifting without identity, direction, or ambition. Off it, the chaos is even worse.\"\n\nSenior United officials are continuing their search for a caretaker boss to replace Amorim, although sources with an understanding of the situation say substantive conversations with front-runners Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are yet to take place.\n\nSources close to Ratcliffe defend him, pointing to the £250m of his own money he has invested in the club, including a complete renovation of United's Carrington training complex, as proof he is genuine in his wish to drive the club forward.\n\nHowever, others point to the decision to retain Erik ten Hag following the 2024 FA Cup final win over Manchester City, invest £200m in new players, then sack the Dutchman just nine games into the new Premier League season, and then doing something similar with Amorim after last term's 15th-placed finish, as clear examples of flawed thinking.",

    "description": "Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli is criticised for pushing Conor Bradley while he was down injured - but Liverpool boss Arne Slot defends him.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli has apologised for trying to push injured Liverpool defender Conor Bradley off the pitch during Thursday's 0-0 draw between the teams.\n\nNorthern Ireland international Bradley landed awkwardly near the touchline when chasing the ball in stoppage time, falling to the ground and immediately clutching his knee.\n\nMartinelli then dropped the ball on the full-back before shoving him in the back in an attempt to get him off the playing surface to allow the game to continue.\n\nThat action sparked a melee between the two sets of players, with Martinelli and Liverpool's Ibrahima Konate both yellow-carded for their involvement.\n\nAfter receiving treatment, Bradley was taken away on a stretcher and was later seen leaving Emirates Stadium on crutches and with a knee brace.\n\nFormer Manchester United players Gary Neville and Roy Keane were both highly critical of Martinelli, with Neville saying his actions were \"absolutely disgraceful\" and describing the Arsenal winger as an \"idiot\".\n\nMartinelli later issued an apology on social media, saying the two players had been in contact and he had already said sorry.\n\n\"I really didn't understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment,\" Martinelli posted on Instagram.\n\n\"I want to say I'm deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.\"\n\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot defended Martinelli after the match, suggesting the wider issue of time-wasting in football may have led to the flashpoint.\n\n\"I don't know Gabriel Martinelli, but he comes across as a nice guy,\" said Slot.\n\n\"I think the problem for him - and it's a problem in general in football - is that there is so much time-wasting and players pretending that they are injured in the final parts of the game and during the game, that you can sometimes be annoyed if you want to try to score a goal that you think the player is time-wasting.\n\n\"You cannot ask Martinelli to think so clear in the 94th minute.\"",

    "fullText": "It was after Liverpool's 4-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven at Anfield in November that Steven Gerrard said his old team just kept on \"bleeding\".\n\nA ninth defeat in 12 matches for Liverpool was inflicted that night, but Liverpool have stemmed the painful flow and are now 10 games unbeaten since being embarrassed by the Dutch champions.\n\nWith a spirited display in Thursday's goalless draw against leaders Arsenal, Arne Slot's side became the first visiting team to take a Premier League point at Emirates Stadium since Manchester City in September.\n\nConor Bradley's first-half effort which struck the crossbar was the closest either side went to scoring, while Liverpool were the better team in the second half with 66% possession.\n\nWithout a recognised striker, however, they lacked a focal point to their attacks.\n\nHad Hugo Ekitike been fit enough to feature, the visitors could perhaps have taken the win, though this was still a decent night for Liverpool.\n\nAfter poor showings in recent draws against Leeds and Fulham, last season's champions delivered a performance from which Slot can take plenty of positives.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch were solid in midfield and Milos Kerkez had arguably his best game for the club as he dealt superbly with the threat of Bukayo Saka.\n\nDefensively, Liverpool prevented Arsenal having an attempt in the second half until stoppage time. Mikel Arteta's side have now failed to score against Liverpool in both games this season.\n\n\"I think Arne Slot will be absolutely delighted with the performance of the players,\" said ex-Reds forward Daniel Sturridge on Sky Sports.\n\n\"You've got to give him credit for his game plan. They weathered the storm for the first 20 minutes. After that, their work rate, how tenacious they were, it was a very experienced performance and they showed why they are champions.\n\n\"They lacked the cutting edge up front but had very positive moments. Jeremie Frimpong was a threat all night but missed the final pass. Florian Wirtz was very good, picked up a load of pockets and was very clean tonight. The list goes on. The defence was magnificent.\n\n\"They stopped attacks all night and I think the manager and players should be very proud of themselves. They performed exceptionally.\"",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): He kept a clean sheet against Sunderland, and he's really starting to command as a regular number one. He's starting to show that he commands the area in the right way. Obviously a penalty save always helps.\n\nMichael Keane (Everton): The guy they tried to get rid of, they guy they wanted to replace, the guy they want to move on from, the guy who keeps telling them no. He keeps scoring, he keeps delivering. I think he's gotten really comfortable within his own skin as a human.\n\nIbrahima Konate (Liverpool): I thought this was a vintage Konate performance. Not only did he deliver physically, which we know he can do, but he was in a position to look after his team-mates. When Gabriel Martinelli tried to crudely push Conor Bradley off the pitch at the end, I'm glad Konate stuck up for his team. He got back physically, wasn't a liability and stood up strong.\n\nMax Alleyne (Manchester City): The young man played really, really well against a tough Brighton team. He never got caught wanting and had an opportunity to score. He conducted himself well, and I thought it was a glowing endorsement from Pep Guardiola to start him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): The best player on the pitch. People will say: \"Oh what about him and him?\" But I don't care. If you play football and watch football, you know that Szoboszlai was everywhere. Did the dirty stuff, the horrible stuff, but was one of the best attacking options for Liverpool apart from Jeremie Frimpong. He dictated the play, it was a very good performance.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): He's just a beast. The work that he has done, and the work Eddie Howe has done on him, is just frightening. He keeps popping up with important goals, but remember that they signed him as a striker. He's just turned into a beast of a midfielder who runs all over you.\n\nBrenden Aaronson (Leeds): A couple of goals - though he was at fault for the handball, which was only down to him not being brave enough to take one in the face. Scored two and has won over the Leeds faithful. He's having a really good season and has borne the brunt of some unfair criticism from Leeds fans.\n\nFerdi Kadioglu (Brighton): He was a thorn in Nathan Ake's side all day. On another day, he'd be a bit lucky and score a goal or two, but he was excellent. Brighton weren't scared of Manchester City at all.\n\nHarvey Barnes (Newcastle): Two goals, the second being the match-winner, which was absolute limbs and scenes. He's another player where you're like: \"Go on, show us who you are.\" Unfortunately he always leaves you a little bit wanting. I'm always thinking there's more to come from him. That's not to take anything away from his goals.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Sixteen goals this season. We spoke about him last week - he's flying. Scoring again, carrying Brentford. They've got a real chance as long as he stays fit and continues doing what he's doing.\n\nBenjamin Sesko (Manchester United): He has had a torrid start to his Manchester United career. But he scored two goals at Burnley and you have to give it to him.\n\nKeith Andrews (Brentford): It was a massive result for Brentford to beat Sunderland 3-0. At the start of the season, a lot of people were questioning whether Keith was the right man for the job and whether Brentford could stay in the league.\n\nHis inexperience, the squad getting depleted... now they find themselves on the path towards European places. It's frightening. Sunderland have been really good and I expected them to deal with the physicality of Brentford, but Brentford beat them up.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?
