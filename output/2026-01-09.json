    "fullText": "Following his first full season as the Longhorns' starting quarterback, Arch Manning is earning national attention for his play. On Thursday, the Louisiana native was one of five players added as a finalist for the Manning Award. In total, there are 15 finalists for the honor.\n\nDuring the 2025 campaign, Manning completed 248-of-404 passes for 3,163 yards. While completing 61 percent of his passing attempts, the Longhorns' star found the end zone 26 times and etched his way into the record books. He had three games with at least 300 passing yards and three touchdown passes without an interception, the most by a Longhorns QB since Major Applewhite in 1999.\n\nManning Award Finalist - @ArchManning 🤘 pic.twitter.com/zePcnfmWTY\n\n— Texas Football (@TexasFootball) January 8, 2026\n\nWhile the Isidore Newman High Alum made headlines with his arm, he was also a threat on the ground. The Longhorns ' sophomore recorded 399 rushing yards on 92 carries. That was the second-most on the team, trailing only Quintrevion Wisner, who is now a Seminole. Regardless of the opponent, Manning found a way to make an impact.\n\nAlthough Manning had an up-and-down start, he got better as the season went on. When he was locked in Texas was hard to stop and held their own against ranked teams. While the Longhorns did not qualify for the College Football Playoff, they did finish with 10 wins and beat Michigan in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl.\n\nArch Manning outrunning the entire defense for 60 yards \nHe was absolutely rolling pic.twitter.com/rhhOKpsgSa\n\n— Bengal (@BengalYouTube) December 31, 2025\n\nAs Manning begins preparing for his junior campaign, he will be watching how the voting for the award named after his uncles plays out. While it is a crowded field, the former five-star recruit made a compelling case with his play as the season winded down. The winner will be revealed on January 19th, after the College Football Playoff National Championship.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Longhorns Wire: Texas Football QB Arch Manning named finalist for Manning Award",

    "fullText": "Michigan football's star running back from 2025, Justice Haynes, is on his way out of Ann Arbor.\n\nHaynes announced he was entering the transfer portal on social media on Friday, Jan. 9. Haynes ran 121 times for 857 yards (7.1 yards per carry) and 10 touchdowns across seven games before he was lost for the season due to injury against Michigan State in the final game of October.\n\nHaynes, who also caught 13 passes for 50 yards, broke his foot late against MSU which required surgery the following week. He had a boot on his foot and rode a scooter for much of the next month and could not return before the end of the season. He was on the sideline for U-M's Cheez-It Citrus Bowl loss to Texas, but did not dress.\n\n\"I want to express my gratitude to the University of Michigan,\" Haynes' post began. \"This place has shaped me in ways that go far beyond football. ... Representing Michigan and embracing what it means to be a Michigan Man is something I'll always be proud of.\n\n\"After reflection, prayer and heartfelt conversations with my family, I've made the decision to close my chapter at the University of Michigan. I plan to return for another year of college football and enter the transfer portal.\"\n\nMORE PORTAL NEWS: Michigan football loses multiple defensive back starters to the portal\n\nHaynes, who spent just one season in Ann Arbor, was a true gamebreaker. He was tied for third in the nation with four rushes of 50 yards or more, which included two touchdown runs of more than 70 yards. The only thing that seemingly could stop Haynes this year was his own injuries. He also went down in the first half of a game against USC with an injury to his midsection and missed the following week against Washington.\n\nIn the six games he was able to play at least one half, Haynes had more than 100 rushing yards and at least one touchdown. While this is a big blow to U-M's backfield, it was somewhat expected. Jordan Marshall, who was another star for the Wolverines in Tony Alford's room, had already made his announcement he was going to return to Ann Arbor in 2026.\n\nOn top of that, the Wolverines bring in Savion Hiter, the No. 1 running back in the nation in the class of 2026. Also, on Thursday, Jan. 8, the Wolverines signed Taylor Tatum, the former No. 1 running back in the nation in the class of 2024, from Oklahoma.\n\n\"To the Michigan fans and the Ann Arbor community, thank you for embracing me with open arms and cheering me on,\" Haynes said. \"To my brothers in the locker room, I'll forever cherish the bond we share and the memories we made on and off the field.\n\n\"Michigan will always be a special part of my story. I'm deeply thankful for everything this chapter has given me.\"\n\nTony Garcia is the Wolverines beat writer for the Detroit Free Press.

    "fullText": "Former Colorado Buffaloes backup quarterback Ryan Staub is quickly becoming one of the more intriguing names in the transfer portal, with visits lined up with Ohio State, Kentucky and Cincinnati in the coming days.\n\nThe trio of stops highlights the level of interest Staub has generated among programs looking to add depth, competition and experience to their quarterback rooms.\n\nStaub served as a reserve at Colorado under head coach Deion Sanders, backing up Shedeur Sanders, Kaidon Salter and Julian Lewis over his three seasons in Boulder.\n\nNow in the portal and reportedly looking to start, Staub is drawing interest from three very different programs. Ohio State offers a chance to develop in one of college football's best programs and perhaps challenge five-star freshman Tavien St. Clair to be Julian Sayin's backup. However, the Buckeyes do not appear to be the best fit if Staub wants to start. Kentucky is another SEC program, but with the Wildcats adding Notre Dame's Kenny Minchey in the transfer portal, Staub would likely be a backup once again.\n\nRyan Staub has visits lined up to Ohio State, Kentucky and Cincinnati in the upcoming days, he tells ESPN. https://t.co/yW5j1yaHW5\n\n— Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) January 8, 2026\n\nCincinnati, on the other hand, gives Staub the best chance to become a starter after star quarterback Brendan Sorsby moved to Texas Tech this offseason. With the Bearcats also bringing in Georgia Southern transfer JC French IV, Staub and French would compete for the starting job in the spring.\n\nAll of Buff Nation should be excited to see Staub getting attention from multiple top programs as he continues his quest for regular playing time.\n\nFollow Charlie Strella on X, Threads and Instagram.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Colorado QB Ryan Staub transfer portal visit Ohio State, Kentucky",

    "fullText": "Dana White has weighed in on the most intense rivalry the sport has ever seen.\n\nAs UFC CEO, he has been ringside for countless personal clashes over the years.\n\nKhabib Nurmagomedov vs Conor McGregor is easily the most high-profile feud to come out of the organisation.\n\nFrom a bus attack and arrests to an all-out melee following their fight at UFC 229, it was about as chaotic as it gets.\n\nBut according to Dana White, there is another pairing that topped even them.\n\nIn January 2015, Jones got the better of ‘DC’ over five rounds at UFC 182.\n\nTwo years later, their rematch saw Jones land a KO, but that result was later overturned after he tested positive for turinabol metabolite.\n\nTheir feud also featured a press conference brawl that is still fresh in White’s memory over a decade later.\n\nWhen asked to name the greatest rivalry he has been a part of, the UFC boss replied: “It would absolutely be those two.\n\n“They fist fought in the lobby of the MGM. Yeah, [Dave] Sholler blew that one.\n\n“The hardest thing is, when you’re there, you are not there for a photo op. You are there to make sure these guys don’t touch or disrespect each other. Once somebody feels disrespected, they’ve gotta get theirs in.\n\n“I don’t care who you the f— you are, you are not stopping s— once some of these guys decide to go.”\n\nThe long-standing feud between Jones and Cormier has resurfaced, this time over a Russian reality TV show.\n\nCormier said the two had verbally agreed to a trilogy fight during one of their heated exchanges on set, though it would take place under wrestling or boxing rules rather than MMA.\n\nDespite efforts from Jones to bury the hatchet, he is now convinced that there is no going back between them. Speaking on Thursday, he did not hold back his thoughts on ‘DC’.\n\n“What a stuffy, just d—head Cormier really is. I think if you really get to know Daniel Cormier, he’s really not (a nice person), he’s an a–hole, he really is an a–hole.\n\n“He didn’t really connect with any of the fighters here, he’s just an a–hole. I tried to make peace with him many times, and he made it very clear that he wants to be enemies for life because of how lucrative it is, and he’s just – I don’t know.\n\n“There was moments where we got to laugh, but for the most part, he’s a d—head.”",

    "description": "Oregon will face Indiana in a Big Ten rematch and we go over why the Ducks are in the league in the first place.",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff semifinals will feature the most anticipated rematch of the entire year on Friday as the No. 5 Oregon Ducks will square off with the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers in the Peach Bowl.\n\nThe two teams previously met in a tight top-10 clash back on October 11, one that saw the Hoosiers go into Eugene and leave with a 30-20 victory. This proved to be the most consequential result in the Big Ten this year as it helped propel IU to a matchup with fellow unbeaten Ohio State in the conference championship game while also costing Oregon a shot at successfully defending its Big Ten title.\n\nSome of you may not be in tune with all of the conference realignment moves that have taken place in college athletics over the past few years and may be wondering “wait, why Oregon is in the Big Ten? That seems weird.” And you are correct, it is weird! The Ducks now call what has historically been a Midwestern league home because the old Pac-12 fell apart.\n\nTo summarize how this came to be, this decade’s round of realignment kicked off with Oklahoma and Texas jumping in tandem to the SEC, a massive move that strengthened the already powerful southern-based league. The massive boost in revenue and prestige for the SEC put pressure on other power conferences to keep up, especially a Pac-12 that had dragged its feet on securing an adequate media rights deal through two commissioners. Trying to ensure their own futures, USC and UCLA sent shockwaves through the college sports landscape in the summer of 2022 with the announcement of them joining the Big 10, destabilizing the West Coast league they were leaving behind.\n\nWithout the Los Angeles schools, Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff continued to struggle to secure the conference a new media rights deal and those efforts were further complicated when the Big 12 was able to extend its agreement with FOX and ESPN in June of 2023. He was finally able to present a deal with Apple to league members that August, an underwhelming offer that prompted several schools to start looking for the exits. What resulted was the floodgates being opened as Oregon and Washington left for the Big Ten, the quartet of Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah departed for the Big 12, and the California Bay Area duo of Cal and Stanford ended up in the ACC. Oregon State and Washington State were left behind in the wreckage and has since assembled a new Pac-12 that is set to go live next season.\n\nSo yeah, that’s why Oregon is in the Big Ten and playing October games against the likes of Indiana and Wisconsin instead of Arizona and Cal. It’s a true shame that the premier West Coast conference as we knew it no longer exists, but that’s just the nature of college athletics these days.",

    "title": "PGA Tour makes Farmers exit from Torrey Pines official. What comes next?",
    "description": "The PGA Tour said Friday that Farmers Insurance would no longer sponsor the event at Torrey Pines after an eventful 17-year run",
    "fullText": "In the winter of 2010, the PGA Tour’s long-standing tournament in San Diego faced an existential crisis. Person fortunes had been lost and businesses were still reeling from the world’s financial crisis that began only 15 months earlier, and among the companies filing for bankruptcy was auto giant General Motors. GM funded the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines for 18 years and hauled in a sponsor's bounty: six victories by Tiger Woods. But after filing for bankruptcy, GM pulled its support one year before the end of the contract and left the Century Club of San Diego scrambling for a new title at a time in corporate America when few CEOs wanted to be seen supporting perceived vanity projects.\n\nThat tournament in 2010 was set to simply be called the “San Diego Open” for the first time in five decades. Hats and tickets and banners were made with a simplistic logo that reflected the spartan times.\n\nThen a Martin Luther King Jr. Day miracle happened. On the holiday Monday, Jan. 18—10 days before the tournament was to begin—California-based Farmers Insurance agreed to a one-year sponsorship deal that infused much-needed cash and enthusiasm into the tournament. And though the golf gods didn’t exactly deliver a rousing champion in Ben Crane, Farmers rode in like a white knight and would come through again and again for the tournament over the next 17 years.\n\n“It was the 11th hour of the 11th hour,” Tom Wilson, the Century Club’s then-tournament director, said at the time.\n\n“They saved our bacon,” said Marty Gorisch, the current Farmers Insurance Open CEO.\n\nThe reminiscing these days carries a tinge of melancholy, because, as the PGA Tour and Century Club confirmed to Golf Digest on Friday, this will be Farmers' last year as the title sponsor. Though the company’s logo has already been seen prominently during broadcasts of the second-year, tech-infused TGL, Farmers is getting out of the major-league golf tournament business.\n\nThis ending has seemingly been written for at least a couple of years, during which no announcement came that Farmers was re-upping. But it’s also rare for the tour to acknowledge a sponsor’s farewell before its last hurrah. In this case, there was sentiment that Farmers should get to take a bow at the tournament that will be played Jan. 29-Feb. 1 on the Torrey Pines South and North courses, rather than shuffling off into the sunset when the final putt drops on Sunday.\n\n“We’ve been through the pandemic with them, date shifts with them, and weather with them,” Gorisch said. “And then we had some really amazing champions and did great charitable work. Business things are taking them in another direction now, but they started great, they’ve been great, and they’re being classy right up until the end.\n\n“I just got off the phone with them,” Gorsich added. “We’re talking about the APGA [tournament] for this year and about our charities. They’re not going out with a whimper; they’re going out strong.”\n\nThe PGA Tour and Farmers Insurance each issued short, unattributed statements on Friday about the relationship.\n\n“Farmers Insurance has been a tremendous sponsor of the PGA Tour, and we cannot thank them enough for their support of the Farmers Insurance Open over the last 17 years,” the tour said in its statement.\n\nFarmers’ statement read, in part, “The tournament has generated millions of dollars for charity and delighted golf fans in San Diego and beyond. As our sponsorship comes to an end, we celebrate everything we’ve accomplished and wish the PGA Tour and the Century Club of San Diego continued success.”\n\nTiger Woods won the last of his eight titles at Torrey Pines at the 2013 Farmers Open.\n\nAccording to the Century Club, during the Farmers era, $20 million in charitable donations were distributed, another $5 million of in-kind contributions were made, and 12,000 hours of volunteer time was logged. Farmers and the Century Club worked their way around the 2021 U.S. Open and significant renovations performed on both of Torrey Pines’ courses. There were numerous fog delays, a couple of Monday finishes and one particularly violent storm in 2016 that forced evacuations from the property. Then came the news four years ago that the tournament would have to move to a Saturday finish so as not to conflict with the NFL playoffs. Farmers pressed on and even created a nationally televised showcase on those Sundays that gave unprecedented exposure to the minority APGA Tour.\n\nThe San Diego event is one of five on tour whose sponsorships run out after the 2026 season. The others are Sony at Waialae in Hawaii, Genesis at Riviera in Los Angeles, Schwab at Colonial in Fort Worth and Wyndham at Sedgefield in Greensboro, N.C. In each case, no re-signings or new sponsors have been announced for those events, and any further word seems unlikely until the tour’s newly formed Future Competition Committee (FCC) makes its recommendations, possibly sometime in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nUntil then, tournaments like those in San Diego find themselves in the odd position of being like a car maker marketing a new model that has yet to built. The parts are all there, but who’s going to buy it if they don’t know what it looks like? Potential sponsors want to understand a tournament’s future stature, cost structure and place on the schedule.\n\nIn San Diego and at Torrey Pines, Gorsich believes he has one the tour’s most marketable events, and tour sources indicate there is strong interest in San Diego among potential sponsors. This year’s tournament will be the 59th held at Torrey Pines, and there are only eight current venues that have been associated with the tour for at least 50 years. Two U.S. Opens have been staged on the South Course, and the list of winners in Farmers’ time alone includes six different major champions. Beyond that, there are the drone shots of the Pacific Ocean coastline that are rivaled only by those at Pebble Beach.\n\n“In our sport, the place you play means something,” Gorsich said. “Blindfold me, put me in front of the TV, and take the blindfold off—there are a lot of courses it would take me a while to figure out. Torrey Pines is not one of those. Those watching know the history here, they know what Tiger or Jon Rahm did on certain holes. It’s a special place and people will watch that.”\n\nSan Diego might have one other big thing going for it in a tour schedule reshuffle: The chairman of the FCC is Woods, who attended his first tour event at Torrey Pines and and has won there eight times.\n\nNow surrounded by three events on the West Coast Swing that have been designated as signatures, along with having a Saturday finish the last four years, the Torrey Pines tournament has gotten a bit lost in the noise of those, as evidenced by TV ratings that are far lower than in Woods' heyday. This year, however, the Farmers is back to a Sunday conclusion, and Gorsich said corporate hospitality and daily ticket sales are “well ahead” of where they have been in recent years.\n\nThere’s always chatter about strength of field, and the Farmers has seen some drop-off of players who most move the needle. Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy, for example, have schedules that usually don’t include Torrey Pines. However, when the Genesis Invitational was moved last February on late notice to San Diego because of the fires in Los Angeles—only three weeks after the Farmers was played—large crowds turned out to see the stars in the signature-level field, and the TV ratings were strong. Ludvig Aberg’s victory on Sunday drew an average of 3.4 million viewers, making it the most-watched non-major broadcast since the 2024 Players Championship.\n\nFor this year's Farmers, among the bigger names to have committed thus far are two past champions, Justin Rose and Max Homa, along with Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott, Patrick Cantlay and Tom Kim. The commitment deadline is Jan. 23.\n\nDespite the challenges and changes he faces in coming months, Gorisch said he’s bullish on both his tournament and what the PGA Tour has in mind for its future.\n\n“Golf is hot and sponsors want to be in,” he said. “Taking Torrey out of it, I’m excited about the change. It’s not change for change’s sake, right? Let’s strategically address some things that maybe we’ve kept a certain way for a long time and really look at it thoughtfully. That’s exciting to me, and it should be exciting to any event, and they should respect that regardless of what it may mean for them.\n\n“It’s hard to argue with the fact that this is purposeful and thoughtful.”",

    "fullText": "Football bettors can be quick to discount quarterbacks making their postseason debut.\n\nI don’t blame you. History might be working against New England Patriots QB Drake Maye, but while his passing prowess is in question his ability to run the ball isn’t.\n\nMy same-game parlay has Maye picking up rushing yards and cracking the end zone against the Los Angeles Chargers Sunday night.\n\nHere are my best NFL same-game parlay picks and predictions for Chargers vs. Patriots on Sunday, January 11.\n\nThe half-point hook on New England Patriots -3.5 is enough to push me toward the moneyline. I believe New England wins what will be a grinder of a game, especially with the Los Angeles Chargers having to play in the cold in Foxborough.\n\nDrake Maye’s rushing attempts were tempered down the stretch, as the team tried to protect him for the postseason. However, with everything on the line, New England unleashes Maye. His rushing yards projections sit as high as 31 yards.\n\nThe Chargers are extremely tough to pass against and tighten up in the red zone. That leaves Maye to do it himself when things break down close to the goal line.\n\nNote if there is an applicable parlay boost available.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Welcome to SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across the MLB. Throughout the year we ask questions of the most plugged-in Orioles fans and fans across the country. \n\nWhatever else happens between now and the start of the 2026 season, there’s no question that Mike Elias was busy this offseason, nor is there any question that he made serious moves to address weaknesses with last year’s team. Both the trade of Grayson Rodriguez and the acquisition of Shane Baz still are surprising, moves of a nature that he hasn’t really made before.\n\nThere is also still a lingering feeling about whether enough has been done with the rotation, particularly at the front end. If nobody else is brought in, then there is a lot riding on Kyle Bradish and Trevor Rogers remaining in good health and repeating something close to the performance we’ve seen from them most recently. That pressure lessens if a signing or trade brings in someone with a strong track record who can keep that up.\n\nIn this week’s survey, I asked Orioles fans whether they think the team will make another starting pitching addition over the course of this offseason. An overwhelming majority said yes:\n\nAt this point, unless there’s a surprise addition to the trade market, the available names with some credible claim to being a front-of-the-rotation pitcher are free agents Ranger Suárez and Framber Valdez, and assumed-available Milwaukee starter Freddy Peralta.\n\nLook close enough at Suárez and Valdez, as you must to think about signing them to the kind of deals they’ve been believed to be seeking, and you can certainly find things to make you nervous about how their performance will hold up over the length of a substantial free agent contract. Yet Peralta would just be a one-year rental, so the Orioles would have to surrender young players or prospects who could help in the future for a guy they might only have this year.\n\nHow that might be addressed is still an open question, but Orioles fans clearly expect Elias to do something else big this winter.\n\nThis week’s survey was sponsored by FanDuel.",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Diamondbacks will not trade second baseman Ketel Marte, general manager Mike Hazen said on Friday, Jan. 9, bringing an end to months of discussions about a possible deal.\n\nThe club had explored the possibility of a trade in the hopes of bringing back younger, cheaper players. A deal also would have shed payroll that could have then been reallocated.\n\nHazen has said over the past month that he did not want the talks to drag much beyond the start of the year. He wanted to turn his focus to finding other ways to upgrade his roster.\n\nThe Diamondbacks seemed interested in making a deal happen if the right one presented itself. Apparently, one never did.\n\nOne possible reason was that the club was said to have had a high asking price that rival clubs were reluctant to reach. Teams also might have preferred to take their chances on the free-agent market, which still features several unsigned star position players.\n\nAnother possibility is that clubs were concerned about Marte’s makeup and fit in a new clubhouse, particularly after he upset teammates by missing games after the All-Star break last year following a break-in at his Scottsdale home, an incident for which he later apologized.\n\nKeeping Marte, of course, is far from a bad outcome for the Diamondbacks. He has been the best second baseman in the majors over the past few seasons, accumulating 16 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), per Baseball-Reference, the most at the position.\n\nIt could, however, make it more difficult for the club to shore up its pitching staff.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have rounded out their rotation this winter by bringing back free-agent Merrill Kelly and signing veteran Michael Soroka, but the bullpen, a major trouble spot in recent seasons, remains unchanged and in need of upgrades.\n\nHazen has said he remains engaged in the free-agent and trade markets in search of bullpen help.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Ketel Marte trade won't happen despite rumors, Diamondbacks GM says",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s pursuit of Carlos Baleba has taken a sharp twist as Real Madrid have stormed into the race for the 21-year-old midfielder – but the Red Devils remain at the front of the queue.\n\nUnited’s priority in the transfer market is a much-needed overhaul of their midfield.\n\nThe ongoing uncertainty over the current cohort at Old Trafford — Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo — means that two recruits are expected to arrive, whether in January or during the summer window.\n\nUnited’s first-choice targets are Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton, and Baleba, whom the club made advances to sign last year. However, Brighton & Hove Albion’s refusal to enter negotiations prevented a deal from being struck.\n\nThere was firm expectation United would return to the south coast again for the Cameroon international, who is representing his country at the African Cup of Nations alongside his compatriot — and Red Devil — Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nThe pair are hoping to propel the Indomitable Lions to their sixth AFCON triumph, with Baleba’s “commanding” performances making him one of the standout stars at the tournament in Morocco so far.\n\nIt’s understood that interest in Baleba was primarily driven by the recently departed Ruben Amorim, however, who had identified the Brighton enforcer as an ideal fit in his 3-4-2-1 system.\n\nINEOS’s decision to dismiss Amorim on Monday morning sent shockwaves across English football, sparking a wave of questions about the long-term direction of the club.\n\nBut it also creates doubt over United’s continued interest in Baleba, given the biggest proponent of his signing is no longer at Old Trafford.\n\nAnd this is further complicated by a report from Spain that Real Madrid have locked on to the Cameroonian as a potential solution to their midfield woes.\n\nDefensa Central reveals Los Blancos are “closely examining” the prospect of launching a raid for Baleba this summer, as they search for a new option in Xabi Alonso’s engine room.\n\nThe Spanish powerhouse has dispatched scouts to the Amex Stadium to watch the 21-year-old in action this season — and they have delivered positive reports, despite his erratic form in comparison to last year.\n\nBut Fichajes contends that officials at the Bernabeu consider Brighton’s asking price — said to be “around €90 million” — too expensive for a player still so raw, and so have ruled out a move.\n\nThis conflicts with reports in England that the Seagulls’ valuation is in excess of £100m (€115m), though a more expensive figure would just further compound Madrid’s decision, rather than change it.\n\nRegardless, Madrid’s movements are a positive development for United, should INEOS decide to maintain their pursuit of Baleba even without Amorim at the helm.\n\nA European juggernaut, with an excellent scouting system, considers Baleba an excellent midfield prospect, but lacks the financial will to follow through on their interest.\n\nThis validates United’s interest in the Cameroonian, while eliminating a potential rival for his signature. It is a win-win for a club who has endured too many losses recently, on and off the pitch.\n\nFeatured image Ryan Pierse via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

As we continue forward with the Mountain West men’s basketball season, we will be updating the conference’s bracketology outlook as we approach the big dance in March! Let’s dive into this week’s update!\n\nBracket Matrix (out of 58 brackets; Jan. 7): 58\n\nAverage Bracket Matrix Seed: 7.43\n\nSkinny: Utah State remains the lone soul for an at-large bid. The only way the MW currently nets multiple bids is if the field — not Utah State — wins the MW Title. They are the only program in the top-40 in NET and in the top-45 in KenPom. They will be tested within the next week against a struggling Boise State on the road on Saturday, and Nevada at home on Wednesday, Jan. 14.\n\nAverage Bracket Matrix Seed: 9.77\n\nSkinny: It was a rough week for Boise State. They dropped 10 spots in KenPom and 24 spots from last week’s NET as a result of their triple overtime loss to San Diego State and 17-point loss to Grand Canyon. Obviously, the latter stings much more than the former. It’s looking more realistic that Boise’s only path to making the NCAA Tournament is a MW championship, despite topping the conference in Quad 1 wins (2) when the field has three combined.\n\nAverage Bracket Matrix Seed: 10\n\nSkinny: New Mexico received the biggest bump from last week’s bracketology. They jumped 22 spots in NET, beating Wyoming (Quad 3) at home by 20 before beating Colorado State by 10 inside Moby Arena. Winners of nine of their last 10, they have a pretty soft schedule coming up, with six of their next seven being Quad 3 or 4 games. The Lobos are now 4-3 in Quad 1-2 games, with their next being on Jan. 17 against SDSU.\n\nAverage Bracket Matrix Seed: 11\n\nSkinny: While it picked up a pair of Quad 2 wins over Boise and Nevada, the Aztecs moved up just 11 spots in NET and are still on the outside-looking-in. They have three Quad 2 games over the next two weeks against Wyoming, New Mexico and Grand Canyon, which could be pushed to Quad 3 if Grand Canyon (currently 97 in NET) falls out of the top-100.",

    "fullText": "Villanova Wildcats 12-3 (3-1) at Marquette Golden Eagles 6-10 (1-4)\n\nWhere: Fiserv Forum (Milwaukee, WI)\n\nWhen: Saturday, Jan. 10 at 2:30 PM\n\nHow to Listen: Villanova Sports Radio Network\n\nNet Rankings: Villanova 29, Marquette 156 (Quad 3 opportunity)\n\nKenPom: Villanova 25, Marquette 116\n\nTorvik: Villanova 30, Marquette 137\n\nAbout Marquette: The Golden Eagles have really struggled this year, as evidenced by their record. Since the new landscape with year-to-year transfers has started, head coach Shaka Smart has gone against the grain. Smart has not dipped into the transfer portal, instead opting for the old-school way of developing. It’s admirable, but this year it seems to have caught up with them, despite returning 10 players from last year’s NCAA tournament team.\n\nMarquette is led by Big East First-Team selection Chase Ross. The 6’5” senior guard averages 16 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game. Though his percentages are down significantly, from both the field and from deep, from a year ago. Behind Ross is freshman Nigel James Jr. The 6’ guard was a 4-star recruit, and thus far is averaging 12.4 points and a team-leading 3.9 assists per contest. That’s the list for double-digit scorers. The Golden Eagles have 12 players who average at least 7 minutes per game, but as of late they are using a 9-man rotation. Sixth-leading scorer Sean Jones has missed the past two games with a foot injury.\n\nMarquette is currently 342nd in the country in three-point percentage, averaging 29.5% as a team. The Golden Eagles are even worse from the field, shooting 40.3% (good for 344th at the moment). Those struggles extend to the free-throw line, where Marquette shoots it at 69.2% (0.1% better than Villanova).\n\nNotes on Nova: The Wildcats are coming off of a tough loss at home against Creighton. The defense in the second half was a huge problem, so the opportunity is there to bounce back on that end against a well-below average Marquette team. Marquette also struggles to defend the rim (only 0.5 blocks per game more than Villanova), so if the ‘Cats are patient they should be able to get what they want on offense. Matt Hodge, Bryce Lindsay and Devin Askew are all looking for better performances in Milwaukee, where the Wildcats have already picked up a win this year against Wisconsin.",

    "fullText": "The Cowboys are set to begin interviews for their defensive coordinator opening. Just 72 hours after the firing of Matt Eberflus, the team will kick off the conversations to find his replacement with three meetings reportedly over the next two days.\n\nPer NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, the Cowboys will interview Vikings assistant Daronte Jones and Browns assistant Ephraim Banda on Friday, with Broncos assistant Jim Leonhard rounding out the current slate on Saturday.\n\nThe Cowboys had hoped to also speak with Falcons assistant Jeff Ulbrich but was denied permission, as Atlanta reportedly hopes to keep him on staff to serve under their next as-yet-unnamed head coach.\n\n#Cowboys will conduct their 1st round of defensive coordinator interviews today, speaking with #Vikings defensive pass game coordinator Daronte Jones and #Browns safeties coach Ephraim Banda, then they'll speak with #Broncos defensive pass game coordinator Jim Leonhard tomorrow.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 9, 2026\n\nHead coach Brian Schottenheimer said earlier in the week that the process of evaluating their current coaching staff could take \"10 to 12 days,\" but announced a parting of the ways with Eberflus the following day, after a historically poor season that saw the Dallas defense give up a franchise-worst 30 points per game.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones explained in the team's season-ending press conference that neither prior head coaching nor coordinator experience at the pro level would be considered a prerequisite for the current DC job; none of the current candidates have either.\n\nHere's a quick look at the first three interviewees for the role.\n\nJones has been Minnesota's defensive pass game coordinator since 2023 and was the Vikings' defensive backs coach in 2022 and also in 2020 (with a year as LSU's defensive coordinator in between). The 47-year-old is thought to bring a lot of the qualities that the team likes in current Vikings DC Brian Flores. The Jets have also requested permission to interview Jones for their DC job.\n\nBanda, 44, has coached the Browns' safeties since 2023, hired to the job by current defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. Despite the team's 5-12 record this season, Banda safeties Grant Delpit and Ronnie Hickman helped the team put up top-three numbers in passing yards allowed. Prior to Cleveland, Banda spent a dozen years in the college ranks; he worked defensive quality control at Mississippi State in 2015, Dak Prescott's senior year.\n\nLeonhard is considered by many to be a rising star in the coaching world. After 10 years as an NFL safety, he went back to his alma mater of Wisconsin to begin his coaching career and then returned to Denver (where he played in 2012) to be the Broncos' defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator in 2024. Last year, the 43-year-old added assistant head coach to his job duties. Leonhard has history with Brian Schottenheimer; he was a Jet for three years while Schottenheimer was offensive coordinator there.\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

The Hoosiers are a 70% favorite according to ESPN’s matchup predictor and currently own a 10-0 record on their home floor where the game will be played.\n\nHowever, the surprising Cornhuskers are 15-0 and own the nation’s longest winning streak at 19 thanks to their 4-game run to glory in the esteemed College Basketball Crown tournament. Much like their tilts against Illinois, Michigan State and Ohio State, few believe in them.

    "fullText": "Adrien Rabiot urged calm after Milan were held to a frustrating 1-1 draw by Genoa, insisting the Scudetto race remains wide open despite another missed opportunity in the title chase.\n\nThe Rossoneri failed to make their dominance count and were left to settle for a point, a result that left a sense of regret within the squad.\n\nRabiot admitted Milan did not manage the game as well as they should have, particularly in the opening stages.\n\n“We started well, then we conceded,” the midfielder explained, with quotes via MilanNews, conceding that the first half fell short of expectations, “especially in front of goal.”\n\nTURIN, ITALY – DECEMBER 08: Adrien Rabiot of AC Milan celebrates scoring his team’s first goal with teammate Matteo Gabbia during the Serie A match between Torino FC and AC Milan at Stadio Olimpico di Torino on December 08, 2025 in Turin, Italy. (Photo by Valerio Pennicino/Getty Images)\n\nMilan improved markedly after the break and pushed for a winner, but Rabiot acknowledged that the failure to kill off the match left them exposed late on.\n\n“In the second half we played better, but unfortunately we didn’t manage to win. In the end we even risked losing it, and that’s not something that should happen,” he said.\n\n“There was time to create chances, we had the match in our hands and we need to do better in certain situations.”\n\nThe Frenchman also highlighted a recurring issue that has crept into Milan’s performances this season: slow starts.\n\n“We always tell ourselves to start well, but sometimes we’re not there mentally,” Rabiot admitted.\n\nWhile praising the team’s second-half response, he was clear that relying on late surges is not enough. “We do better after the break, but we can’t play only 50 minutes per match. We’ll keep working on this, especially on the mental side.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 23: Adrien Rabiot of AC Milan applauds the fans following the final whistle of the Coppa Italia Frecciarossa Round of 16 match between AC Milan and US Lecce at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on September 23, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images)\n\nDespite the dropped points, Rabiot rejected any suggestion of panic regarding Milan’s title ambitions.\n\n“It’s January,” he stressed. “The season goes until May, there are many matches and many head-to-head games. We need to stay calm, recover our energy for Sunday and keep going.”\n\nMilan, he concluded, remain firmly in contention. “We’re there,” Rabiot said. “We’re not worried.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile trading Trae Young appeared to be a long shot for the Atlanta Hawks last season, it seemed more realistic this season.\n\nYoung, who’s been injured for most of the season and is shooting a career-low 30.5% shooting from three, was at a standstill with the organization through 7.5 seasons. As a result, the Hawks traded the four-time All-Star to the Washington Wizards on Wednesday for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert.\n\nOn Friday, the real reason the Hawks completed the blockbuster deal was revealed.\n\n“On behalf of the Hawks franchise, I’d like to thank Trae for how he embraced the city of Atlanta and represented the Hawks during his time here, on the court and in the community,” Hawks GM Onsi Saleh said in an official statement.\n\n“Over more than seven seasons, including four All-Star appearances, he cemented himself as a fan favorite and one of the great players in our franchise’s history. We wish Trae and his family all the best.”\n\n“Adding CJ McCollum, one of the NBA’s most prolific shooters and a respected veteran, along with an established young veteran in Corey Kispert, will strengthen our team on the court and in the locker room, and we retain flexibility for future opportunities to continue building our program.”\n\nEssentially, while Saleh respects and appreciates Young’s contributions to the Hawks’ organizations, both parties desperately needed a reset. Atlanta, which is firmly in rebuild mode, added McCollum and Kispert to help jump-start that process and move the organization in the right direction.\n\nThe Hawks don’t have any ill will toward their 2018 No. 3 overall pick, but simply put, it was time for a change.\n\nMore NBA: Knicks cut ties with Jalen Brunson's 6-foot-8 teammate after less than two seasons",

    "fullText": "The Alabama Crimson Tide will host the Texas Longhorns at Coleman Coliseum on Saturday night.\n\nThe Tide enter the matchup following a Top 15 road loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, as a multitude of injuries ultimately cost Alabama the game. Labaron Philon Jr. recorded 18 points on 5-of-9 shooting despite playing just 19 minutes, as the star guard left the game with full-body cramps and was unable to return in the second half.\n\nAden Holloway and Latrell Wrightsell could see an increase in playing time, should Philon remain sidelined, but the Tide will look to get the sharpshooter back from injury as soon as possible, starting with this game against Texas.\n\nHere are three bold takes for Alabama's matchup against Texas.\n\nHolloway recorded 22 points on 9-of-18 shooting during Wednesday night's loss, as the junior guard was able to step up and play at an elite level following Philon's injury. The former Auburn star could thrive once again if Philon is unable to play, as the sharpshooter has proven to shine with an increased workload on numerous occasions in the past. Holloway is currently shooting an impressive 46.7% from behind the arc, as the star will look to stay hot on Saturday evening.\n\nSherrell has played a critical role on both ends of the floor for the Crimson Tide. The talented big man currently leads the team in blocks with 2.8 per game, and Sherrell's presence on the glass has undoubtedly been missed while he has been sidelined. The sophomore forward could be in prime position for a major performance should he return on Saturday night, as the Tide continue to slowly get healthier as the season progresses.\n\nAllen has continued to turn heads throughout the first few months of the 2025-26 season. The impressive freshman led the Crimson Tide in points with 25 during Wednesday night's loss in Nashville, as Allen has quickly earned himself a much larger role and has thrived in recent weeks. Allen could benefit from Philon's injury should he remain out on Saturday, but ultimately the freshman could still be in for another big night nonetheless.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama basketball bold predictions for game vs. Texas Longhorns",

    "title": "2026 Willie McCovey Memorial Community Prospect List No. 27",
    "description": "Who is the No. 27 prospect in the system?",
    "fullText": "The 2026 baseball season is so close that I can almost taste it. And that means the return of not just Major League Baseball, but also Minor League Baseball. But how can Minor League Baseball begin without prospect lists?? It simply cannot. And so we must finish our 2026 Willie McCovey Memorial Community Prospect List, in which we will rank the top 44 prospects in the San Francisco Giants organization. We’re comfortably past the halfway mark, so we can’t stop now!\n\nWednesday’s ballot resulted in a fairly one-sided election, and it brings us one of the more hotly debated prospects in the system: left-handed pitcher Joe Whitman, who has been voted as the No. 26 prospect in the system, dropping 17 spots from his ranking of No. 9 last year.\n\nWhitman was a compensation round selection in the 2023 draft, being taken with the pick the Giants received when Carlos Rodón signed with the New York Yankees. With the 69th overall pick, the Giants made Whitman the first college southpaw taken in the draft.\n\nThe Kent State product hasn’t quite lived up to that draft billing, though he’s shown some interesting flashes. He spent the entirety of the 2025 season with AA Richmond, where his numbers were so-so: in 117.1 innings, he sported an ugly ERA of 5.29, but with a much-better FIP of 3.61, with 9.51 strikeouts and 3.61 walks per nine innings and a 41.2% groundball rate.\n\nInterestingly, Whitman’s ERA underperforming his FIP seems to be a trend: in 2024, his first full season (which was split between Low and High-A), he posted a 3.80 FIP but just a 4.63 ERA.\n\nWhitman — who turned 24 in September — poses an interesting problem for prospect evaluation, due to a fairly black-and-white issue: his fastball is not good at all. According to Baseball America, Whitman’s fastball got torched last year to the tune of a .305/.372/.469 slash line in a very pitcher-friendly Eastern League, and all of the home runs he allowed came on that pitch. Needless to say, the fact that he stayed afloat with hitters teeing off on his fastball speaks highly to the rest of his arsenal … but you can’t make the Majors, let alone survive there, without a fastball. And giving up far more hits than innings pitched in the Eastern League is a pretty damning preview of what’s to come without a fastball fix.\n\nAnd so, the case with Whitman becomes pretty straightforward, if convoluted when trying to assign value to it. If he can fix his fastball, which sits low-90s, he’ll probably have a lengthy career as a Major League starter. If he can’t fix his fastball, he faces an uphill battle just to get a cup of coffee as a reliever. How do you blend those truths? Well, by making him the No. 26 prospect in the system, apparently.\n\nNeedless to say, 2026 will be a critical year for Whitman. If he shows signs of improvement with his fastball, he’ll be much, much higher on this list next year. And if he doesn’t, then he’ll quickly turn into a forgotten draft pick in a long stretch of forgotten Giants draft picks. I would assume that he’ll be back in Richmond for a second pass at AA this season, given his mediocre performance in 2025 and the bevy of arms lined up to start in AAA Sacramento. Keep your eye on him, folks … this is why following the Minor Leagues is so fun!\n\nNow let’s add to the list, and we have some new names to choose from today! As a reminder, voting now takes place in the comment section using the “rec” feature.\n\nNote: Clicking on the above names will link to the CPL where they were voted onto the list.\n\nRayner Arias — 19.8-year old OF — .173 OPS/-42 wRC+ in Low-A (30 PA); .699 OPS/87 wRC+ in ACL (178 PA)\n\nCarlos De La Rosa — 18.1-year old LHP — 4.73 ERA/2.30 FIP in DSL (32.1 IP)\n\nLisbel Diaz — 20.5-year old OF — .725 OPS/96 wRC+ in Low-A (561 PA)\n\nTrent Harris — 26.11-year old RHP — 5.44 ERA/4.69 FIP in AAA (41.1 IP); 1.69 ERA/1.73 FIP in AA (16 IP)\n\nAlberto Laroche — 20.1-year old RHP — 2.11 ERA/3.12 FIP in DSL (38.1 IP)\n\nJoel Peguero — 28.8-year old RHP — 2.42 ERA/3.85 FIP in MLB (22.1 IP); 5.10 ERA/4.79 FIP in AAA (42.1 IP)\n\nDiego Velasquez — 22.3-year old 2B — .677 OPS/107 wRC+ in AA (566 PA)\n\nNote: Each player’s first name links to their Baseball-Reference page, and their last name links to their Fangraphs page. All stats are from the 2025 season.",

    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins are hiring Green Bay Packers VP of Player Personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan as their next General Manager, per a report from Dianna Russini of The Athletic.\n\nSullivan, 50, has been a member of the Packers’ front office since joining in 2003 as a training camp intern. He since ascended the organization’s ladder and was named the VP of Player Personnel in 2022. Russini adds that the Dolphins’ philosophy is to hire their GM, then pursue a new head coach.\n\nThe obvious question is how this impacts the New York Giants’ pursuit of Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh. It was widely expected that the Dolphins would hire Los Angeles Chargers assistant GM Chad Alexander, who has worked with both John and Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe expected connection between Harbaugh and Alexander was considered to be a significant mark in Miami’s favor in swaying Harbaugh. It’s possible that Alexander doesn’t want to leave Los Angeles, or that Harbaugh does in fact favor the Giants. If we’re looking for personal connections, it’s possible that the Dolphins favor Mike McCarthy or Packers’ DC Jeff Hafley — or that their focus has shifted in that direction.\n\nESPN’s Jeff Darlington added some context to the reporting surrounding the Dolphins hiring Sullivan.\n\nSo how does this impact the potential hiring of John Harbaugh, you ask? The Dolphins remain interested, but I would not describe them as fixated. As I've been mentioning, the team believes in a structure that puts the GM in place first. The firing of McDaniel was never about the… https://t.co/LDpEbTN25K\n\n— Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) January 9, 2026\n\nIn particular, there’s a definite shift in the tone used to describe Miami’s interest in Harbaugh. Where they were described as having a “burning interest” in Harbaugh as recently as Thursday, they are now described as being “interested, but not fixated.”\n\nRussini has also reported that the Giants have maintained open communications with Harbaugh’s camp in order to be as well prepared as possible for next week’s interview.",

    "fullText": "I think we should all take a moment to congratulate Caleb Williams for setting the all-time Bears passing yardage record in 2026 with 3,942 yards.\n\nDid he manage to get to 4,000 yards?\n\nDid he require an extra game to take down previous record holder Erik Kramer, who would have had 4077.88 yards if prorated to 17 games in his epic 1995 season?\n\nDid his “Yards per Game” total rank a mere 10th overall in Bears history behind Jay Cutler several times, but also Brian Griese, George Blanda, Brian Hoyer, and Jim McMahon?\n\nBut it’s still quite an accomplishment, I suppose, if you don’t think about it too hard. And hey, he almost, but not quite, cracked the top three in touchdown passes with 27, just two behind Kramer’s 29, and slightly behind Cutler and Sid Luckman at 28.\n\nAnd we can probably just ignore the thing about Caleb’s completion percentage being lower than every other top ten quarterback in yardage except for Rex Grossman and Billy Wade (both 54.6% v. Caleb’s 58.1%). And that his ANY/A (6.76) is still behind Kramer’s.\n\nIt was such an impressive season, in fact, that if Williams were a Packer, those 3,942 yards would rank all the way up at 19th, behind several Aaron Rodgers and Brett Favre seasons, but also Jordan Love’s 2023, Don Majkowski’s 1989, and Lynn Dickey’s 1983.\n\nHey, Mitch Trubisky only started 14 games in his pretty good 2018 season? Does that pro-rate to more yards than Caleb over 17 games?\n\nWell, not quite, it gets him to 3,913.6, but pretty close? And he completed a robust 66.6% of his passes, though his 6.72 ANY/A was just a bit behind. But don’t worry, I’m sure Williams’ second season and Trubisky’s second season being so close statistically doesn’t mean anything.\n\nAnyway, let’s give it up to Caleb for putting up a lot of yards in a lot of games while being sort of efficient in doing so for a team where that’s considered great!",

    "title": "49ers playoff history: Can Kyle Shanahan remain undefeated in the Wild Card round?",
    "description": "Looking back at the 2 games the 49ers played in the Wild Card round under Kyle Shanahan",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers are 6-2 all-time in the Wild Card round. That’s impressive. Kyle Shanahan’s teams have been so good when they’ve made the playoffs that they’ve avoided the first round of the playoffs altogether. In two Wild Card appearances with Shanahan as the head coach, the 49ers won both games. Let’s revisit those ahead of this weekend’s matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe 49ers scored a touchdown on their opening drive. Deebo Samuel, in the wideback days, had the first two carries of the game. Jimmy Garoppolo’s first pass went to Travis Benjamin for 17 yards. Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo had first-down receptions on the drive, and Elijah Mitchell had a 13-yard gain before a four-yard touchdown.\n\nOn the Cowboys’ first drive, Dre Greenlaw had a tackle for loss, and Nick Bosa sacked Dak Prescott on third down. Remember those days?\n\nThe Niners had a chance to score another touchdown on the next drive, but Mitchell lost 11 yards on a screen pass. No worries, as Robbie Gould nailed a 53-yarder. Garoppolo had six completions to six different receivers through two drives.\n\nPrescott completed a 32-yard pass to CeeDee Lamb on 3rd & 6 on the ensuing drive, but the play came back after Arden Key drew a holding penalty. The 49ers were generating pressure with four.\n\nRe-watching this game, and jet sweeps to Deebo and Aiyuk are the kinds of easy yards the 49ers don’t have. Samuel took a slant for 19 yards on 3rd & 3. Jimmy scrambled and found Aiyuk for a 3rd & 9 completion to move the sticks. But Deebo was stuffed on third and short, leading to another Gould field goal.\n\nDallas finally answered after trailing 13-0. Amari Cooper beat K’Wuan Williams on a slot fade to draw the Cowboys within six.\n\nThe big-play threat of Aiyuk came through on a 37-yarder, beating Trevon Diggs. But a batted pass on third down meant the Niners would once again settle for a 52-yard field goal from Gould.\n\nIn the third quarter, Arik Armstead had a sack. Bosa was injured earlier in the game and was questionable to return. He came back and would leave again with a head injury. Bosa’s replacement, Jordan Willis, hit Dak on 3rd & 7 to force an errant pass and a punt.\n\nThe 49ers had six second-half drives. They punted on four of them, threw an interception on one, and scored on a Deebo Samuel run, one play after K’Wuan picked off Prescott.\n\nThe story of the game was the defense holding the Cowboys scoreless for two quarters. Their touchdown came after Jimmy’s interception. Dallas only needed to go 28 yards. Everybody remembers Prescott spiking the ball with no time remaining, but the 49ers had five sacks and controlled the game.\n\nThis was Brock Purdy’s coming-out party on the national stage. The 49ers had a good record, but few knew how much was due to the rookie quarterback.\n\nIt was also one of the most underrated defenses of the past five years. Arik Armstead kicked things off with a sack. After a field goal on the first drive, Christian McCaffrey ran for 68 yards to begin the second drive, highlighted by Aiyuk’s downfield blocking. Those explosive plays are what’s missing from the 2025 version of the 49ers.\n\nSeattle was impressive in the first half. They scored 17 points against said underrated defense, going 71 and 78 yards on both scoring drives. They matched the Niners’ explosive plays, including a 50-yard touchdown pass from Geno Smith to DK Metcalf to give Seattle a 14-13 lead.\n\nBut it was the type of play you live with. Metcalf beat Charvarius Ward. Those are not the type of plays where you are going to get over on against an elite defense consistently.\n\nWith just over a minute to go in the first half, Purdy found Aiyuk for a 31-yard gain and Deebo for 18 yards. Gould made his third field goal of the half, bringing the 49ers within one point at halftime. That would be the last time Seattle had the lead.\n\nKittle and Deebo were recipients of big plays on the ensuing drive that was capped off by a Purdy sneak for a touchdown. Seattle got into San Francisco territory, and actually the red zone, before Bosa recovered Charles Omenihu’s sack fumble on 3rd & 14. That felt like ballgame.\n\nShanahan schemed Jauan Jennings open on a 30+ yard pass, before Purdy had one of those video-game type of plays, spinning out of a tackle and finding Elijah Mitchell for a touchdown pass. Kittle converted the two-point conversion, and the 49ers had a commanding 31-17 lead.\n\nAfter a quick three-and-out, Deebo caught an intermediate pass and navigated his way down the sideline while Aiyuk blocked two Seahawks defenders to give the 49ers a three-touchdown lead.\n\nOn the next defensive drive, Deomodore Lenoir, wearing No. 38, intercepted Geno Smith. A field goal made it 41-17 before Seattle added on a garbage-time touchdown.\n\nThe 49ers aren’t expected to beat the Eagles. They’ve gone from 2.5-point underdogs all the way up to 5.5 as of writing. Oddsmakers are expecting a game similar to the one we saw in Week 18. But if there is anybody who has proven they can excel in the Wild Card round, it’s Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff.",

He heavily considered BYU before his mission but ultimately committed to the Trojans. Listed at 6-foot-4 and 245 pounds, Walker was USC’s fifth leading receiver. He finished the season with 20 receptions, 223 receiving yards, and 2 TDs. He had 4 catches for 39 yards at Illinois and 2 catches for 42 yards versus Michigan.\n\nBYU must replace starting tight end Carsen Ryan and Lyons will likely fill that role. He is a big body who has good receiving skills and should see his production see a big uptick now that he has a clear path to be tight end #1. Aaron Roderick has proven that he will use skilled tight ends. Carsen Ryan was BYU’s third leading receiver this season, finishing with 45 receptions, 620 yards, and 3 TDs. Lyons has the same ability to make a similar impact.\n\nLyons will be a junior this upcoming season and should make a big impact both of his seasons in Provo.\n\nYou can watch some highlights below.\n\nI see you Walker Lyons!\n\nInitial contact at the 15-yard line.

    "description": "Residues on arrow tips found in South Africa hint at how far back in history humans have been using poison for survival.",
    "fullText": "Today it seems obvious: Dip a sharp object in a poisonous substance, and then use that weapon to take down your prey. But when did human beings figure out this deadly strategy?\n\nIt remains as mysterious as the dawn of setting fires, building wheels and painting on caves. But a new study pushes back the timeline of this innovative hunting technique by tens of thousands of years.\n\nResearchers led by Sven Isaksson, a professor of archaeological science at Stockholm University, have discovered poison residues on 60,000-year-old arrow tips unearthed in South Africa. With the next-oldest trace of poison use dated to 35,000 years ago, these tips preserve the earliest evidence of poisoned weapons by a wide margin.\n\n“It’s a big leap,” Dr. Isaksson said of the discovery, which was published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.\n\n“It might be an even earlier practice,” he added. “This is just the earliest evidence so far.”\n\nThe finding reinforces existing evidence that early Homo sapiens had cognitive abilities nearing the sophistication of our own. That’s because in order to tip an arrow with poison, hunters needed knowledge of local plants and their effects, as well as the ability to craft special weapons with the right dosages.\n\n“It takes a developed working memory to be able to predict that if I put this arrowhead into that plant, it will shorten the delay before I get my hands on this meat,” Dr. Isaksson said.\n\nDr. Isaksson and colleagues examined specimens that were originally discovered in 1985 at the Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter in eastern South Africa. The shelter contains layers of archaeological remains that were left tens of thousands of years ago. The researchers were inspired to look more closely at a handful of quartz arrow tips lodged in sediments estimated to be 60,000 years old.\n\nThe arrow points are unusually small, which suggests that they might have been crafted to deliver poison efficiently into an impact wound, as opposed to inflicting a blunt-force injury.\n\nThe team performed chemical and molecular analyses of the artifacts. That revealed two toxic compounds, buphanidrine and epibuphanisine, that were most likely collected from Boophone disticha, a plant known as the Bushman’s poison bulb. It remains a frequent source of poison used by traditional hunters in the region, such as the San and Khoe peoples, to this day, helping them slow their prey rather than kill it with a knockout blow.\n\nFelix Riede, a professor of archaeology at Aarhus University in Denmark, called the discovery a “spectacular finding” that appears to be “the earliest evidence of poison use globally so far.”\n\nHe added that the paper was a demonstration “that it is possible to extract poison signatures from even very ancient residues on stone tools.” Similar compounds should be sought elsewhere, he said.\n\nMichelle C. Langley, an associate professor of archaeology at the Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution at Griffith University, likewise pointed to the possibility that new clues about this ancient tradition may be hidden at other fossil sites or in collections.\n\n“It is always worth going back and taking another look,” Dr. Langley said. “Especially as our techniques get better and cheaper and faster, people can at least look for things in the tiny little crevices and cracks where maybe something has been kept all those years.”\n\nShe also noted that the identification of these poison-tipped weapons added to a growing body of evidence that our human ancestors 60,000 years ago — and even earlier — were cognitively on par with modern humans.\n\n“I’m not surprised that they found this,” Dr. Langley said. “It’s just building on everything that’s come before it, and really substantiating that the people 60,000 years ago were as complex as we are today.”",

    "description": ": Just refreshed to avoid 5G interference? Do it again, FAA tells industry, as Upper C-band auction looms",
    "fullText": "Airlines operating in the US may have to upgrade their aircraft radio altimeters again at a cost of billions of dollars, to avoid potential interference with cell networks following the Trump administration's decision last year to auction off additional spectrum to bidders.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a notice of proposed new regulations. If implemented, these will require all radio altimeters to meet specific minimum performance requirements.\n\nThose requirements are for altimeters to able to withstand interference from wireless signals in neighboring spectrum bands, while continuing to provide accurate altitude readings to both pilots and integrated aircraft safety systems.\n\nAnd the cost for all this? The FAA estimates the total bill to retrofit aircraft with interference-tolerant altimeters will be $4.49 billion, or $424 million annualized at a 7 percent discount rate over 20 years.\n\nAccording to the FAA, the blame for this move lies with the Trump administration and its US budget bill signed into law last year that directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to open up more radio frequencies to be auctioned off for commercial use.\n\nThis sell-off must include at least 100 MHz and possibly as much as 180 MHz of the 3.98 to 4.2 GHz band (Upper C-band), which the FCC intends to make available for terrestrial wireless flexible use, as disclosed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [PDF] last year.\n\nHowever, aircraft radio altimeter (RA) systems operate in the adjacent 4.2 to 4.4-GHz band, and the FAA is clearly worried about the possibility of interference if cellular network operators start using the Upper C-band to deliver services.\n\n\"FAA expects future wireless services in the Upper C-band aligned with service rules in the Lower C-band to cause interference to current RA systems. Existing RA systems are not compatible with this envisioned use, and airworthiness directives issued by FAA in 2023 are insufficient to address the unsafe condition that will result from wireless services in the Upper C-band,\" the agency says in its proposal document.\n\nWireless service providers have already taken voluntary measures in the proximity of airports, the FAA says, but these commitments will hit a sunset date at the start of 2028 unless extended by mutual agreement, and long-term compatibility between Lower C-band wireless services and RA systems has not been resolved beyond that date.\n\nIt believes that a single retrofit of RA systems will be able to address compatibility issues with wireless services in both the Lower and Upper C-band, and says the aviation industry has been working to develop standards for next-generation RA systems for several years now.\n\nThe deadline for making these changes is proposed to coincide with the FCC's date authorizing the initiation of new wireless services in the Upper C-band, which the FAA currently expects to be sometime between 2029 and 2032.\n\nThis isn't the first time this issue has arisen. Back in 2021, The Register reported that the FAA was concerned enough to consider restricting flights once 5G services were up and running. European aviation regulators declared that this wasn't an issue on their side of the Atlantic, however.\n\nThe solution from the FAA back then was also to replace the affected RA systems, and the agency set a deadline of February 1, 2024 for all updates to be carried out. It later declared that, as of the end of September 2023, the entire US airline fleet had upgraded their equipment and the risk of 5G interference had been mitigated.\n\nUntil last year, of course, when the newly installed Trump administration decided to start re-allocating spectrum in order to generate more revenue from license fees.\n\nThe FAA's notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) document is open for comments for 60 days, a period that ends on March 9.\n\nA spokesperson for Airlines for America - a trade association for US passenger and cargo airlines - sent a statement to The Register:\n\n\"We have been working collaboratively with the telecommunications industry, the FAA and the FCC to identify solutions that ensure our nation's airspace remains safe while allowing the spectrum to be used.\n\n\"We were expecting this NPRM, which was published to fulfill requirements included in the One Big Beautiful Bill, and are currently evaluating all of the details in the proposal and will be providing comments.\"\n\nThe Reg also asked International Air Transport Association (IATA) for comment. ®",

Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), and Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote that “X’s generation of these harmful and likely illegal depictions of women and children has shown complete disregard for your stores’ distribution terms.” X users have identified several cases where Grok undressed or sexualized apparent minors in the AI-created images.\n\nThe senators point to the app stores’ own policies for why the app should be removed. Google’s terms of service say that apps are subject to removal if they fail to bar users from “creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children” or portray kids “in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children.” Apple prohibits apps that are “offensive” or “just plain creepy.” Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether X was in compliance with their policies and whether they planned to remove the app.\n\nFailing to remove X from the app stores would both show a double standard, and undermine the companies’ arguments for their control over the app stores in the first place, the lawmakers write. Both companies removed ICEBlock and Red Dot from their stores following government pressure. The apps were used to anonymously report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. “Unlike Grok’s sickening content generation, these apps were not creating or hosting harmful or illegal content, and yet, based entirely on the Administration’s claims that they posed a risk to immigration enforcers, you removed them from your stores,” the senators wrote.\n\nThey also warned that inaction would “undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones. This principle has been core to your advocacy against legislative reforms to increase app store competition and your defenses to claims that your app stores abuse their market power through their payment systems.”",

    "description": "Sam Bail, the founder of Bright Nights Social, told Business Insider that demand is booming for her alcohol-free nightlife events in New York.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Bail, a data engineer and the founder of the alcohol-free pop-up event company, Bright Nights Social. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThree years ago, I had the idea to open an alcohol-free bar in New York City.\n\nI don't drink, but I still wanted nightlife — dancing, music, meeting new people, getting out of the house on a Friday or Saturday night. What I didn't want was another alcohol-free space that was centered on wellness, meditation, or yoga. I wanted something that still felt like real nightlife, just without booze being the main event.\n\nInstead of signing a lease, I started testing the idea by hosting pop-up events. I'd take over coffee shops or other venues at night and turn them into alcohol-free bars for the evening.\n\nWhat started as an experiment quickly took on a life of its own.\n\nOver the past three years, I've collaborated with tons of venues, experimented with a variety of new formats, and thousands of people have come through our doors. That's been the most surprising part of all of this: the demand.\n\nWhat's even more interesting? Most of the people who attend my events aren't even sober.\n\nWhen people hear \"alcohol-free event,\" they often assume the crowd is made up entirely of sober or sober-curious people. That hasn't been my experience at all. Based on conversations with guests, I estimate that at least 75% of the people who attend my events don't identify as sober or even sober-curious.\n\nThey're mostly in their mid-20s to early 30s — older Gen Z and very young millennials. Gender splits depend on the event, but many of my parties are close to 50-50 men and women. What they have in common is that they want to go out, socialize, and have fun without making drinking the center of their entire social life.\n\nI'm 40, so I'm an elder millennial who's already done the heavy partying phase and is over it. But many of the people who come to Bright Nights Social are younger than me and feel the same way. They'll tell me things like, \"I still drink sometimes, I just don't want to do it every time I go out,\" or \"Alcohol makes me feel terrible the next day.\"\n\nThey're not abstaining out of moral opposition to alcohol or because of addiction. They're opting out because they don't like the cost, the hangovers, or the way drinking dominates social life in cities like New York.\n\nWhat I see aligns with a broader shift happening right now, especially among younger people. There's a growing focus on experiences rather than just going to a bar and spending money on drinks. In New York City, you can see it everywhere: pottery classes, cooking classes, rug tufting, late-night library events, group reading clubs.\n\nSome of my favorites have been hosting cooking classes and our crafting events, like rug-making. Coming up this month, we have a tea bar, a bagel-making (and eating!) class, and a full-on dance party, complete with DJs and a full non-alcoholic bar, to close out Dry January.\n\nPeople want to do something. They want to make memories. They just don't want to wake up feeling awful the next day.\n\nCost is also a big factor. When cocktails are $15 or $20 each, it doesn't take long for a casual night out to become extremely expensive. A lot of people tell me they'd rather spend their money on an experience than on alcohol that doesn't even make them feel good.\n\nThat doesn't mean Gen Z isn't drinking at all. In fact, some recent data suggests younger people are actually drinking more now than they were a year or two ago. I think part of that is a post-pandemic catch-up effect — many Gen Zers reached legal drinking age during lockdowns and simply didn't have the chance to go out.\n\nWhat I see on the ground is moderation. People might have one drink at dinner and then switch to a nonalcoholic beer. Or they'll alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks throughout the night — what some people call \"zebra striping.\" They're being much more intentional about how and when they drink.\n\nAnother huge shift I'm seeing is the role of legal THC. I don't serve THC products at my events, but I don't stop anyone from having one before they come, and I hear about them constantly from guests and friends who work at nonalcoholic bottle shops. THC drinks are some of the best-selling products in those stores.\n\nPeople understand what THC does. They say it helps with social anxiety, takes the edge off, and feels more manageable than alcohol when used in moderation. Compared to that, there's still skepticism around functional or adaptogenic drinks — things with nootropics, ashwagandha, or functional mushrooms. Many people aren't convinced that those drinks actually do anything beyond being a placebo.\n\nThat said, I think we're still early. As people learn what works for their own bodies — whether that's L-theanine, lion's mane, or something else — those functional beverages may gain more traction.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also seeing conversations online about people pulling back from THC after overdoing it, so I think we'll see a similar trend as people try to find nightlife events that best suit their needs.\n\nI don't think most people want to be completely sober forever, but they are actively experimenting with what moderation looks like.\n\nThe biggest misconception about alcohol-free nightlife is that it's boring or restrictive. What I've learned is that people don't want to be told what not to do — they just want more options.\n\nBright Nights Social isn't about sobriety as an identity. It's about creating a space where alcohol isn't the default. You can still dance, flirt, meet strangers, and stay out late. The only difference is that you're not expected to drink to participate.\n\nThe fact that so many non-sober people show up tells me this isn't a niche idea anymore. Alcohol-free nightlife isn't just for people who've quit drinking entirely. It's for anyone who wants to go out — and wake up the next day feeling like themselves.\n\nDo you host or attend alternative nightlife events? Contact this reporter at ktl@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The World Economic Forum found that AI will reshape most jobs by 2030, with only one path limiting major displacement.",
    "fullText": "The World Economic Forum says the future of work isn't doomed by AI — but most paths forward still involve painful disruption.\n\nIn the \"Four Futures for Jobs in the New Economy: AI and Talent in 2030,\" white paper published on Wednesday, the organization laid out four scenarios based on two variables — how fast AI capabilities advance and how ready workers and institutions are to adapt.\n\nThe scenarios range from rapid AI breakthroughs to slower, more uneven progress.\n\nOnly one scenario — dubbed the \"Co-Pilot Economy\" — is explicitly designed to limit large-scale displacement.\n\nIn that future, AI adoption is widespread but measured, and workers have the skills to use the technology as a complement rather than a replacement.\n\nAs the report puts it, \"Gradual AI progress and availability of AI-ready skillsets shift the focus towards augmentation rather than mass automation.\"\n\nInstead of eliminating roles outright, AI reshapes tasks, with humans staying in the loop.\n\nEven this relatively optimistic scenario is far from static.\n\n\"Although displacement and job churn have risen, governments, businesses, and workers increasingly view AI as an opportunity rather than a threat,\" the WEF's report said.\n\nThe remaining three scenarios are more disruptive, but they differ in pace and severity.\n\nIn \"The Age of Displacement,\" AI advances faster than education and reskilling systems can respond, pushing companies to automate aggressively and leaving large parts of the workforce struggling to keep up.\n\nIn \"Stalled Progress,\" AI continues to improve, but productivity gains are patchy and concentrated among a small number of firms and regions, eroding job quality elsewhere and widening inequality.\n\nIn \"Supercharged Progress,\" explosive AI breakthroughs drive rapid economic growth and innovation — but still render many existing roles obsolete faster than new ones can emerge.\n\nHowever, some researchers caution that the future is unlikely to follow any single, clean path.\n\nJames Ransom, a research fellow at University College London, told Business Insider that AI progress and workforce readiness vary widely across industries, jobs, and regions, resulting in uneven rather than universal disruption.\n\nHe expects displacement to accelerate over the next few years — even as he said most workers are still likely to be on the payroll by 2030.\n\nThe Forum said that the future of work will not be defined by technology alone. Throughout the report, it said that policy choices, corporate strategy, and investment in skills will shape how painful — or manageable — the transition becomes.\n\nSaadia Zahidi, a managing director at the WEF, told Business Insider that the four scenarios \"are not predictions of where the world will be in 2030, but a framework to help leaders prepare for the evolving global economy.\"\n\nTech leaders and AI researchers remain split over how disruptive AI will ultimately be to the workforce.\n\nFigures like Geoffrey Hinton, often described as the \"godfather of AI,\" and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have warned that AI could replace large swaths of white-collar work within just a few years.\n\nOthers, including Box CEO Aaron Levie and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have predicted that AI will deliver explosive productivity gains — even as it renders many existing roles obsolete.\n\nA more optimistic camp, including Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman and Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, have said AI will ultimately augment workers.",

    "description": "As someone born and raised in India, I've seen a lot of first-time visitors make avoidable mistakes when planning trips, eating street food, and more.",
    "fullText": "As someone who's lived in India my whole life, I've seen it all: the chaos of a Delhi market at noon, the quiet streets of a Rajasthan village, and the seemingly endless railway platforms where people jostle for a spot on a train.\n\nVisitors often come expecting a single \"India experience,\" but having lived in big cities and small towns, I know that the country changes every few hundred miles.\n\nWith different cuisine and customs in every part of the country, it's no wonder first-time visitors to India are often unprepared. Here are the mistakes I see tourists make again and again — and how to avoid them.\n\nMany first-timers fly into Delhi, rush to Agra for the Taj Mahal, and then stop in Jaipur for forts and palaces, believing they've \"done India.\"\n\nThis route, known as the \"Golden Triangle,\" is iconic, but it's also one of the country's most crowded tourist circuits, where hourslong lines and heavy traffic can overshadow the experience.\n\nThat fast, checklist style of travel shows only one version of India: frenetic, historic, and packed with people.\n\nInstead, I'd recommend ditching the crowds and exploring other areas. Some of my favorite underrated parts of India include the cold deserts of Ladakh and Spiti.\n\nDon't skip rural India, either. Well over half of India's population lives in villages, and in my opinion, spending time in one can teach you more about the country than any monument.\n\nWalking through a small-town market and chatting with local families can give tourists a real sense of daily life.\n\nMany travelers try to see all of India in just one or two weeks, but getting from one city to another can take most of a day due to traffic, road conditions, or transportation delays.\n\nPlus, it'll be harder to enjoy everything India has to offer if you're frequently exhausted from a grueling travel experience.\n\nI believe it's better to focus on one city or state at a time.\n\nFor example, you can spend two weeks in Kerala exploring canals, stunning hills, and spice plantations; meanwhile, a trip to Rajasthan can include visits to many colorful cities and the fresco-rich Shekhawati region.\n\nMost travelers skip street food, fearing \"Delhi Belly\" — that is, traveler's diarrhea — but doing so means missing some of India's iconic local flavors.\n\nEach city has its specialties, from Mumbai's vada pav (a potato fritter between buns) to Varanasi's chaat (a savory street snack) to Kolkata's kathi rolls (a kebab rolled inside a flatbread with onions and sauce).\n\nTo enjoy street food safely, I recommend generally following the crowds, since high turnover usually means fresh food.\n\nI'd also suggest avoiding consuming anything cold or raw unless you can peel it yourself, and refraining from using ice unless it's made from bottled water — tap water isn't safe to drink here.\n\nIf you're nervous, you can also book a guided street-food tour. These are available in most major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Varanasi.\n\nIndia is famously hospitable: The Sanskrit saying \"Atithi Devo Bhava,\" or \"the guest is god,\" exists for a reason.\n\nThat said, paying attention to some basic customs doesn't take much effort, and it will likely make your interactions smoother and earn you some goodwill.\n\nAcross the country, it's respectful to remove shoes before entering temples or homes, and also to dress modestly, especially in rural areas and religious sites.\n\nI'd also recommend avoiding public displays of affection, as it can make some locals uncomfortable. Finally, use your right hand for eating or passing items, since the left is traditionally considered unclean.\n\nWith 28 states and eight union territories, India's customs can vary widely, so it's also wise to check local etiquette before your trip.\n\nSo much in India runs on WhatsApp messages and OTPs (one-time passwords), so you'll need a local SIM to pay for a cab ride or buy train tickets.\n\nI suggest buying a SIM card at the airport upon arrival, or using an eSIM. Preload it with enough data for your entire trip; adding more later can sometimes be tricky with foreign cards.\n\nWhile you're at it, take out some cash, too. The Indian rupee is our only official currency, and although many shops and restaurants accept digital payments, it's smart to carry cash for smaller vendors at local markets.",

    "description": "In an excerpt from Laura Danger's book she explains what emotional labor is, how it shows up in daily life, and why it is often exploited.",
    "fullText": "Emotional labor is the work that underpins our lives.\n\nIt's the thought and care that goes into everything, from what meals to make to what discipline style to use to deciding the best time to have a hard conversation. Emotional labor is what creates and nurtures communities and connections, and it's present in every interaction we have.\n\nIn 1983, Arlie Russell Hochschild, the same sociologist who defined \"the second shift,\" also coined the term \"emotional labor.\" It was originally used to refer to the emotional work required of a job, such as a flight attendant or therapist, but the term has adapted and expanded to describe similar work in any setting.\n\nA flight attendant who needs to manage their own emotions while being condescended to by a drunk passenger must read the feelings of others, predict their behavior, and respond in a way that creates a certain emotional environment. The same work is present in planning holiday meals, delegating tasks on Sunday cleaning days, and facilitating relationships between in‑laws and their grandkids. Navigating everyone's needs, wants, personalities, behaviors, and expectations takes empathy, consideration, and care.\n\nEmotional labor, whether it's paid or unpaid, with customers or between loved ones, is skilled work that demands effort and energy. Emotional labor is ever‑present, tangled up in every interaction we have, from how we deal with receiving dressing on our salad when we asked for it on the side to coming out to our parents. While the term itself is most often used to describe the internal processing and decision‑making that influences how we interact with others, emotional labor is inextricably connected to all other work we do in service of our relationships with others.\n\nWhen a friend loses a loved one, emotional labor is present in the lowering of shoulders and softened tone when offering a hug. It's linked to the mental labor of picking out a black dress and ordering flowers in preparation for funeral attendance. It's connected to the domestic work of cooking a casserole and preparing for childcare so you can be there.\n\nIt takes emotional, mental, domestic, and care work for us to make one another feel secure, loved, and supported. These efforts are the glue that bonds us. This labor creates and nurtures communities. It's the work that goes into making us feel how we feel. This real and necessary work contributes to how we love, connect, and grow.\n\nEmotional labor, like other domestic and care labor, has also been used as a tool of exploitation. There's all kinds of messaging about how women are \"emotional creatures\" or \"just better at\" feelings. This isn't a biological truth. Sex or gender does not determine someone's ability to be empathic. It doesn't determine whether someone can consider others' feelings, respond with care, or achieve a meaningful emotional outcome.\n\nEmpathy, or the ability to assess other people's feelings and put yourself in their shoes, is something we need to practice. Identifying our own and other people's feelings and considering the needs of multiple people in decision-making are skills that need developing. Throughout society, this feminized and often racialized work is disproportionately demanded of the oppressed to protect the power of the oppressor.\n\nWomen often learn to pay attention to the feelings of the people around them because it's a survival skill.\n\nAnytime one person is expected to create and maintain a certain emotional environment without equal effort from the other party involved, emotional labor becomes a tool for subordination. Within relationships, one person's lack of emotional management and regulation creates a situation in which the other person is forced to make up the difference, keeping them in their place. This becomes a tool for harm.\n\nOne person's unwillingness to do their fair share of emotional work forces the person they're in a relationship with to do it for them. Yet emotional labor is the glue that binds us together. It keeps us safe, helps us grow, and makes us feel cared for and loved. Done in service of care and connection, it's how we build intimacy. When emotional labor is given freely and reciprocated, our relationships thrive. So how do we reclaim emotional labor from the ways it's used to exploit us and put it to better use?\n\nIt starts with rethinking what it means to relate with each other.\n\nExcerpted from \"No More Mediocre: A Call to Reimagine Our Relationships and Demand More\" by Laura Danger. \n\nA licensed educator, facilitator, and domestic equity advocate, Laura Danger can be found online at @ThatDarnChat.",

    "description": "When my family of 4 moved to a small town, we downsized and got rid of things we didn't need. We now spend more time together and less money.",
    "fullText": "When my wife and I relocated our family of four from Calgary to Nelson, British Columbia, in 2017, downsizing wasn't the primary goal. It was more of a side effect.\n\nWe didn't sit down with a checklist and decide to cut down on how much we owned, and aim to slash our budget. We just made a move that made sense for our family, and the move also made certain habits around spending and accumulation impossible.\n\nLooking back, I see that what changed most wasn't just the amount of stuff in our house. It was the way our family spent time together.\n\nOur lives were full before the move, but not necessarily in a good way.\n\nWe had more stuff, more commitments, and more reasons to be out of the house spending money. Weekends often revolved around errands, shopping trips, paid activities, and $10-a-piece \"treats\" for the kids to make the grind feel worth it.\n\nWe'd wander around big-box stores without needing anything or kill an afternoon in the mall when the weather wasn't nice (which in Alberta is several months of the year). We'd eat out or order in because we were tired after a long day of work and commuting. We'd sign the kids up for activities and events partly because every other parent seemed to be doing it.\n\nNone of it felt excessive at the time. It just felt normal.\n\nBut it also meant that a lot of our time together centered on consumption. Always buying something, driving somewhere, filling space and time with things that didn't matter. Our schedules were full, yet it often felt like we were ships passing each other in the night rather than actually being together.\n\nAfter the move, this \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" mentality didn't translate to our newfound slower-paced lifestyle.\n\nIn Nelson, there are fewer places to shop, fewer costly activities, and fewer reasons to be constantly on the move. We bought a smaller house and sold things that didn't make sense to bring with us (I'm looking at you, Ikea furniture). We stopped accumulating by habit because there was simply no longer the same pressure or opportunity to do so.\n\nEventually, we realized we didn't miss any of it. We stopped browsing stores for entertainment and defaulting to takeout for dinner. We stopped filling weekends with paid activities just to feel productive. Not because we were trying to be virtuous, but because life here didn't push us in that direction.\n\nWithout really planning it, our days slowed down.\n\nOur family time now revolves around things that don't require much money or planning. Morning hikes and bike rides around the lake. Cooking dinner together. Sitting outside after school and watching the kids play in our big backyard instead of rushing to the next adult-led activity.\n\nOne big thing my wife and I have noticed is that our kids don't ask for \"things\" as often anymore. They now ask to \"do\" more things, whether it's just to hang out, go outside, play a game, or have friends over. When boredom creeps in, it doesn't get immediately solved with a purchase. It turns into creativity, or rest, or sometimes just being bored together.\n\nWeekends now feel less like logistics and more like shared time — and we love it.\n\nDownsizing our life didn't make us happier overnight or solve all our problems, but it did change the conditions of our daily routines. Today, the choices we make around time and space feel more deliberate, less reactive, and better aligned with how we actually want to live as a family.\n\nAs a result, we're now more present with each other than when our lives were busier but less connected. And that's something that has given us the space to notice what matters most and the room to relate to each other without constantly filling the gaps with things, plans, or noise.",

    "fullText": "As I'm stuck in my NYC apartment on a brisk day in January, I can't help but daydream about the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach in Florida. I spent one night there in October 2025 and booked the cheapest available room for $920.\n\nSitting in a cushioned rattan chair on my balcony as the sun went down, I could see the pool surrounded by palms and cabanas, tropical gardens, and the five-star hotel's private beach. It was the epitome of tropical luxury, and I couldn't believe I'd be leaving in the morning.\n\nThe oceanfront hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, is four stories tall with 207 rooms and suites — all of which have their own balcony.\n\nI've stayed at three Four Seasons hotels, and one thing I've learned is that each location is designed to suit the destination. So I wasn't surprised when I stepped inside the lobby and found a tropical decor style.\n\nWith details like chandeliers resembling ropes and pastel pillows patterned with fruit and leaves, it was impossible to forget I was in Florida.\n\nI booked a Palm View room, complete with a king-sized bed across from a TV, a small sitting area, and plenty of floor space. The interior design blended midcentury modern furnishings with pastel accents, making the room feel like a little beach house.\n\nIt was larger than most hotel room balconies I've seen, and there was a table and two cushioned chairs. As the sun began to set, I sat and took in the view of the gardens and the ocean. I long for more sunsets on this balcony.\n\nThe spa features a eucalyptus steam room, a saltwater whirlpool, and a range of treatments, including massages and facials. With less than 24 hours at this hotel, I didn't have time to use the spa.\n\nIf I had another night at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, I would have dined at Florie's.\n\nHerbs in the seasonal cocktails at Florie's Bar come straight from the hotel's garden. For those like me who don't drink, there are plenty of non-alcoholic cocktails available.\n\nThe restaurant serves dishes cooked over a live fire, from pizzas to steaks and fish entrées.\n\nI would also have loved to dine on the shaded patio at Seaway, a seafood restaurant with a wide selection of proteins, including lobster, stone crab, and local red snappers, as well as oysters, tiger shrimp, and fresh tuna.\n\nMany of the dishes feature tropical ingredients, such as coconut, pomegranate, and mango.\n\nI wish I'd had time to relax by the pool while being served frozen fruit and cooling towels.\n\nHow often do you find a pristine beach free of crowds on a hot day?\n\nJust past the pool at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, a sandy pathway leads to a private beach exclusive to Four Seasons guests. When I went, it was quiet and mostly empty. I wish I could have spent more time on this exclusive strip of the Florida coastline.\n\nTo truly relax into the luxury beach vibe of this five-star resort, I'll have to return for a longer stay to try the restaurants, experience poolside service, and spend more time on a quiet, peaceful beach.",

    "fullText": "French AI startup Mistral has secured a major vote of confidence from its home government after landing a deal to provide AI technology to France's military.\n\nFrance's Ministry of the Armed Forces said on Thursday that it has formally notified a framework agreement with Mistral AI, giving the country's armed forces, defense agencies, and affiliated public institutions access to the company's advanced AI models, software, and services.\n\nUnder the deal overseen by the ministry's defense AI agency, Mistral's AI systems will be deployed on French-controlled infrastructure, a key priority for the military as governments grow increasingly cautious about where sensitive data is processed and which laws govern it.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post announcing the deal, Mistral said its AI systems would be deployed on France's own infrastructure and fine-tuned using defense-specific data to support operational military needs.\n\nThe financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Mistral was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant win for Mistral, which was founded in 2023 and is valued at roughly $13.6 billion, following a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) funding round announced last year.\n\nThe startup has positioned itself as a European alternative to US AI heavyweights, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, pitching its models as powerful yet more compatible with Europe's sovereignty and data control ambitions.\n\nIn its statement, translated by Business Insider, the defense ministry said the partnership is intended to strengthen France's \"technological sovereignty\" and ensure the armed forces maintain control over critical AI tools used across military operations and administration.\n\nBertrand Rondepierre, director of the ministry's defense AI agency, said the agreement represents \"a major step\" in strengthening the ministry's generative AI capabilities and preparing the armed forces for future challenges, while maintaining sovereign control over the technologies used.\n\nThe deal comes as European governments reassess their dependence on US technology in strategic sectors ranging from cloud computing to semiconductors and now AI.\n\nThe French ministry's move mirrors that of the US government, which has increasingly inked major contracts with domestic AI companies to develop tools for military and national security use, including recent deals with OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other defense-focused startups.\n\nAs generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in military planning, logistics, and analysis, Mistral's latest win helps to position the startup as one of Europe's key players in the race to develop sovereign alternatives to American tech giants.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "description": "After Alex Delaney's husband died suddenly, she left her career behind. Years later, she's trying to reenter the workforce after grief and motherhood.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to-essay is based on a conversation with Alex Delaney, 41, who is based in Chicago. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAfter my husband died suddenly at the age of 39, both my body and mind remained in a state of shock for years to come.\n\nIt happened in 2018, when I was 34, and it has taken a long time for the cortisol levels in my body to come back down, and, in parallel, for the fog of grief to lift.\n\nIt was an extraordinarily intense experience, and I really struggled, especially with work.\n\nWe were at home, in our apartment in London, when out of nowhere, he collapsed. I rushed him to the hospital, and within 45 minutes, he was pronounced dead. It turned out he'd had deep vein thrombosis, which became the pulmonary embolism that killed him.\n\nJust like that, he was gone, and so was the future we'd been planning. We had been trying to have a child for a long time and were undergoing IVF without any success.\n\nI was working as a PR manager at the time, and the support from my employer was brilliant. I took a solid month off work straight after it happened. I then did a phased return over six months, but I couldn't even sit at my desk and focus. I did not care about work at all and felt completely disconnected from it.\n\nI think some people find work a helpful way to keep busy and take their mind off things. But I just felt very nihilistic, as if none of it mattered, least of all getting a report published in the media. That's why I decided it was time to take a step back from work.\n\nA few months later, in 2019, I found a two-day-a-week role at a women's issues charity, which I thought would help me keep my hand in my career.\n\nI did that for about six months, but ended up stepping up into an executive director role. It wasn't what I wanted. I felt completely burned out and tired, and I didn't want to be thinking about other people's problems. I wanted to be completely selfish, to focus on myself and feel better.\n\nI resigned in 2020 and haven't been employed since then.\n\nBut then things changed. Once you've been happily married, you think, \"Will I ever be happy again?\" So, regardless of what people would think, I got onto some dating apps pretty quickly, because by then, I was a 35-year-old woman who wanted children. My age meant I would have to push myself forward if I wanted this to happen.\n\nI was fortunate to meet and marry another brilliant man, and we had a beautiful son. My new husband was offered a job in Chicago, and I was happy to make the move. When I got here, my visa didn't allow me to work. Our son was only 6 months old at the time, so I was happy to be able to spend that time with him.\n\nI began to feel isolated in my new community, so I pursued a part-time MBA over the next two years. During that time, my green card came, so now I'm entitled to work. We've since also had a daughter, who's now 4 months old.\n\nWhile I'm enjoying taking care of both her and my son, I'm conscious about getting back into work. After a period of grief, you get to a point where you feel you've thought enough about yourself and how sad you are. You're ready to re-engage with the world and discover new things that interest you again.\n\nBut I'm painfully aware of having stepped out of a trajectory where I was going to be a senior director of a charity. After all this time out, it feels really difficult to get back into it.\n\nI've applied for 10 jobs so far, and the job market is tougher than I had anticipated. I have been finding it challenging to secure a new role. Employers are not necessarily seeing the transferable nature of the professional experience I had gained in the UK, which I had thought would be highly relevant, having specialised in the charity sector.\n\nThere's also a cultural difference between the UK and the US, around the confidence with which you speak about yourself in the workplace. In the UK nonprofit sector, there's a sense of humility, where one does not want to overclaim achievements. In the US, you're expected to claim as much as you can. I have to learn how to do that. Sliding post-maternity confidence is a thing, too.\n\nI have, however, had the space to start a business — Lemons.Life — an affordable online will writing service that was inspired by the difficulties I faced after my first husband died. He died without a will, which caused some issues regarding the division of his assets. We do sell a number of online wills each week, and I'm really proud of that. But it's a side project, not a full-time job.\n\nLooking back, I want to tell my younger self to push further in your 20s, because it really matters. I think I stayed in roles too long because I thought I'd have a baby soon, and I wanted maternity leave.\n\nI have had to take the cards I've been dealt, and I'm more resilient for all of those experiences — but there's no doubt about the impact it's had on my career.",

    "description": "I moved from the US to Copenhagen, the world's most livable city. The language and weather were hard to adapt to, so I left nearly two years later.",
    "fullText": "When I moved to Copenhagen in January 2021 for my \"dream job,\" my expectations were high.\n\nI was going to help design a new national museum — full of dinosaur skeletons and other natural wonders — in a place that routinely ranks as one of the happiest and most liveable cities in the world.\n\nJust last year, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Copenhagen as the No. 1 most livable city — above places like Vienna, Zurich, and Osaka — while the World Happiness Report named Denmark the second-happiest country in the world, behind only Finland.\n\nAhead of my move, I envisioned the city as a cobblestone paradise of candy-colored houses, vast bike lanes, and delicious cinnamon rolls — a romanticized fantasy reinforced by a stellar reputation.\n\nLittle did I know, I'd come to find myself running at sunrise because it was the only time the city felt like the place I'd been promised.\n\nI grew up in Vermont and lived there while I finished grad school, so I was used to facing long, cold winters.\n\nBut immediately, Copenhagen felt different, with the January sun rising after 8:30 a.m. and disappearing around 3:30 p.m. — leaving me with about two hours less sunlight than I was used to at home.\n\nThe short days often felt gloomy, with frequent rain bringing a layer of gray clouds unlike anything I'd ever seen — it was like an oppressive, immovable blanket across the entire sky. During the winter months, those clouds could rob the city of sunshine for many consecutive days.\n\nI also quickly discovered why the salary I'd been offered seemed high. Prices in Copenhagen were higher than what I was used to in Vermont, making a simple coffee and pastry feel like luxuries I couldn't afford. But maybe I shouldn't have been so surprised, given the city has regularly found itself on \"most expensive city\" lists over the past few years.\n\nRunning at sunrise became my refuge. Weaving through empty streets flanked by beautiful old houses and canals, I felt like I could see the city's magic.\n\nBut beyond those runs, I was struggling.\n\nI spent my first year in Copenhagen taking language classes, exploring street art, and embracing football culture while sipping Carlsberg beers with the Dane I was dating.\n\nYet, it seemed like there were barriers everywhere. Although I speak three languages, I found it difficult to master Danish, leaving me unable to keep up when happy-hour banter inevitably slipped away from English.\n\nThis, of course, didn't make socializing any easier. My colleagues were pleasant, but they already had calcified social circles. I tried to meet new people by attending live music events, but the local smoking culture made it tricky to find bars that weren't filled with cigarette smoke, which I didn't enjoy.\n\nMeanwhile, summer brought its own challenges. Short winter days were replaced by shockingly long summer ones — think over 17 hours of sunlight. This near-constant light wreaked havoc on my sleep, and sunrise runs were only possible before 5 a.m.\n\nIn this land of extremes, it felt impossible for me to attain a good balance.\n\nOn top of that, so many of the perks that helped Copenhagen earn high marks for livability and happiness seemed designed for someone else.\n\nFor example, I didn't have kids, nor was I expecting any, so Denmark's generous maternity leave and excellent childcare were of no use to me.\n\nAnd although employees here are entitled to a whopping five weeks of vacation time, I felt like I couldn't even take advantage of it because my museum project was behind schedule. I just felt pressured to work more.\n\nA year in, my dream job had become a nightmare. It was my second winter, and the combination of work pressure and isolation in an expensive, dark city was taking its toll. I biked to work in the dark each morning and left in the dark each afternoon.\n\nFor months, I continued lacing up my shoes for runs, hoping to recapture that sense of possibility. But instead, I felt like I was chasing something that would never come.\n\nThe empty cobblestone streets that once seemed quaint were now a metaphor for my lonely existence.\n\nIt suddenly hit me during a morning run in early summer — I was done trying to make it work. After securing a job stateside, I left my notice, and just before autumn threatened to transform into another winter, I packed my life into two suitcases. I hadn't even lasted two years.\n\nOn my one-block walk to the metro, my suitcases got soaked in the rain — a fitting goodbye.\n\nLooking back, my time in Copenhagen taught me that independence has its limits. Community, balance, and a sense of belonging matter more to me than I realized, and if I were to live abroad again, I'd need to know I'd have them.",

    "fullText": "The Marine Corps touts itself as the few and the proud. Getting those few has never been harder, though.\n\nUnlike other arms of the military, the Marines pride themselves on consistently hitting their enlistment goals. But that mission is becoming increasingly difficult despite an overall upswing in military recruitment.\n\nFrom old-school methods feeling outdated to a dwindling birth rate, recruiters who are already stretched to the limit are facing more challenges, writes BI's Kelsey Baker.\n\nIt's the final installment in Kelsey's fascinating four-part investigation into the Marine Corps recruiting practices that are \"burning Marines,\" according to one Great Plains sergeant. She spoke to nearly four dozen recruiters and officials and obtained documents from a Marine Corps investigation and two Marine Corps Inspector General reports.\n\nKelsey's reporting found Marine Corps recruiters face an unusual degree of depression, emotional stress, and elevated risks of divorce, with 15 apparent suicides between 2015 and 2024.\n\nSome of the challenges Marine recruiters face will sound familiar to anyone in sales.\n\nThey have a quota (enlisting two people a month) and deal with frustrating tracking tools that can slow down the process (Military Health System Genesis).\n\nIt's one thing to try to get an executive to buy some software, but it's another convincing a high schooler to sign an enlistment contract.\n\nThe situation can even become hostile, with three recruiters telling Kelsey they had guns pulled on them when visiting homes of potential enlistees.\n\nIn some cases, the pressure to meet targets led recruiters to falsify records and forge signatures. It's an issue that didn't just impact the rank-and-file recruiters, but higher-ups in the Marine Corps, as well.\n\nThe Marine Corps told Kelsey in a statement that the overwhelming majority of recruiters complete their tours successfully. \"We are not yet where we ultimately want to be,\" the service said. \"But trends are undeniably moving in the right direction.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the military is getting creative with attracting enlistees. BI's Jake Gabbard observed US Army influencers at Fort Knox. You can watch the video here.\n\nHowever, while the discourse primarily focuses on who is making weapons for the military, the real question is whether there will eventually be anyone left to operate them in the first place.",

    "description": "Senior engineers are best positioned to benefit from AI. We're good enough to avoid slop, and there's so much we can accomplish. I wouldn't go back.",
    "fullText": "I develop with AI today. It's great.\n\nThere are many articles you can read on why AI is great (or terrible) or how to\nuse it. This is mine. I focus on the experience of a senior engineer (and why\nwe in particular should use AI), on my experience operating within the OSS\nPython Data world, and on practical suggestions that I've found myself\nrepeating to colleagues.\n\nThis article contains learned lessons of two types:\n\nWe'll interleave these two. I'm hopeful that this approach will make this more fun.\n\nAI development is more fun. I do more of what I like (think, experiment,\nwrite) and less of what I don't like (wrestle with computers).\n\nI feel both that I can move faster and operate in areas that were previously\ninaccessible to me (like frontend).\nExperienced developers should all be doing this. We're good enough to avoid AI\nSlop, and there's so much we can accomplish today.\n\nI like this quote from this blog\n\nI get it, you’re too good to vibe code. You’re a senior developer who has been doing this for 20 years and knows the system like the back of your hand.\n\nNo, you’re not too good to vibe code. In fact, you’re the only person who should be vibe coding.\n\nI think that really good engineers, the kind that think hard before writing,\ncan have a tremendous impact and fun while developing with AI. I\nwouldn't ever go back.\n\nThat being said, there are some serious costs and reasonable reservations to AI\ndevelopment. Let's start by listing those concerns:\n\nThese are super-valid concerns. They're also concerns that I suspect came\naround when we developed compilers and people stopped writing assembly by hand,\ninstead trusting programs like gcc to pump out instruction after instruction\nof shitty machine code.\n\nWe lost a deeper understanding as developers when we stopped writing assembly\nbut we gained a ton too. As in any transition, we need to navigate the\nsituation to capture the advantages while losing only a little, balancing the\ncosts and benefits of a new technology.\n\nThis article is how I've been navigating this transition personally.\n\nEarly in using Claude Code (or Cursor) many of my interactions were saying\n\"Yes, it's ok to run that\". This was frustrating and dehumanizing. Mostly my\njob was to enable AI, rather than the other way around.\n\nThere are many tricks to resolve this (see below), but more broadly \"stop doing\nsimple shit\" has been a mantra that I've found myself constantly coming\nback to. The more I identify and reject simple tasks and add automation to my\nworkflow, the higher an abstraction I'm able to climb to and the more\neffectively I'm able to work. Our goal in programming is to climb an\nabstraction ladder and gain more intellectual leverage. This requires thought\nand consistent attention.\n\nFortunately AI can help with this. If you complain and say \"I'm always doing\nX\" it'll suggest solutions like what I'll talk about below, but more tailored\nto your situation.\n\nAI developers, like human developers, benefit from structure.\n\nMost people start with an AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md file. This is a great\nstart, but I find that the AI agent often forgets what's in there. The real\nsolution for me here (at least for Claude Code) is\nHooks.\n\nFirst, let's outline a couple of annoyingly common problems.\n\nLet's say you tell AI that you want to run tests with uv:\n\nwhen running tests, use uv run pytest tests\n\nWhile this works sometimes, AI often decides to run\n\nWhile the agents read CLAUDE.md, they don't always follow the instructions.\nAnd so you're stuck saying \"no, use uv\" over and over again. Gah.\n\nHere's a hook that catches pytest commands missing uv run. You could put\nsomething like this in ~/.claude/settings.json:\n\nThere, we've just automated that annoying task for you forever.\n\nI don't actually do this though (I allow Claude to fail and then it finds the\nright approach.) Mostly this works because I've gotten good at giving Claude\nfairly broad-yet-safe permissions, which is coming up next.\n\nEven worse, Claude often asks for permission to do things that are just\nslightly different from what you've already granted.\nYou allow uv run pytest *, but Claude keeps finding variants:\n\nClaude Code's permission language sucks. It only supports prefixes, while I\nwish it could handle regexes, or maybe even just arbitrary Python code.\n\nI have a complex Python script as a hook which overrides the permission\nsystem. It uses regexes, but also arbitrary Python code as logic. This allows\nme to encode arbitrary combinations of rules. It's great.\n\nOn the rare occasion when Claude asks me for permission for something new, I\nhave a running Claude agent that thinks about this file and considers if it\nshould update the permission script.\n\nMy personal favorite hooks though are these:\n\nThey play subtle little sounds whenever Claude is either done, or needs input\nfrom me. This lets me ignore Claude when it's busy. Previously I found that I\nwas constantly checking back in with Claude to see if it was done, and that\naction was dehumanizing, so I automated it by asking Claude to play a sound.\n\nHooks are great. There are more ways to provide structure (Skills, Commands)\nbut I've found that Hooks are the most dependable, a great starting place, and\noften augment any other structure that I put in place (like Skills).\n\nIn a recent large AI-assisted PR a frustrated reviewer said the following:\n\nTo me, this [size of PR] implies that either\n\nIt's a valid problem, even in single-person projects. We're able to generate\ncode far more quickly than we're able to read it. How should we handle\nreview? Everyone needs to figure this out for themselves, but my answer is\n\"find other ways to build confidence\".\n\nWe already do this today with human-written code. I review some code very\nclosely, and other code less-so. Sometimes I rely on a combination of tests,\nfamiliarity of a well-known author, and a quick glance at the code to before\nsaying \"sure, seems fine\" and pressing the green button. I might also ask\n\"Have you thought of X\" and see what they say.\n\nTrusting code without reading all of it isn't new, we're just now in a state\nwhere we need to review 10x more code, and so we need to get much better at\nestablishing confidence that something works without paying human attention all\nthe time.\n\nWe can augment our ability to write code with AI. We can augment our ability\nto review code with AI too.\n\nMostly I establish confidence on AI-generated work by investing heavily in\ntests and benchmarks, the same as I would with humans, just moreso. TDD is\nbaked into most of the prompting structure I have with agents.\n\nRemember that this is way cheaper than it used to be. Now rather than write a\nbenchmark I can type\n\nHow does this compare in performance to the old version? I'm particularly\ninterested in memory use.\n\nAnd that's it. If it's bad, the agent will say so (and then diligently work to\nmake it good).\n\nAdditionally, if I'm nervous about something subtle like \"Is it possible this change\nmight unexpectedly affect performance in this other feature?\" then I'll ask the\nAI exactly that question:\n\nIs it possible this change might unexpectedly affect performance in this other feature?\n\nAnd it'll just go and investigate exactly that question. Unlike human authors,\nthe AI has no ego at stake in its work, and isn't in the least bit lazy. It's\nour job to ask \"Have you thought of X\" and its job to go learn if that might\nbe an issue. Don't trust its answer? Ask it to prove it to you.\n\nAI has flaws, but it is diligent, and it lacks ego. If you question it, it'll\ninvestigate thoroughly and critique its own work honestly.\n\nLet's review our work and see if there is anything we can simplify or clean up\n\nBefore Opus 4.5 came out this was essential. Now it's merely nice. I've\nturned this into a /cleanup command and integrated it into most of my Skills\nas a final phase in development.\n\nFrom time to time I also ask a fresh agent to do a full review of the project,\nwith an eye to cleaning up technical debt. I tell it to review everything and\nthink hard. It takes a while, but it often comes back with a nice list of work\nfor itself, which it then of course diligently performs.\n\nAI creates technical debt, but it can clean some of it up too.\n(at least at a certain granularity)\n\nIn general we want to give our agents good automated feedback. Tests do this,\nbenchmarks do this, prompting them to assess themselves does this, asking them\nto explain things to us and have us weigh in on high level topics does this.\n\nLLMs are smart enough today that if they're given enough of the right feedback\nthey converge to a good solution as-well-or-better-than a senior human engineer\n(that's my experience at least).\n\nOur job is to construct a system that gives them the right feedback at the\nright time, hopefully without our intervention. This is the same job we have\nwhen we build human teams; now it's just more impactful to do well.\n\nI started AI development with Cursor. It was great having the AI experience\ninside a VSCode-like editor, where I could see everything that was going on.\nWhen I saw terminal-based tools like Claude Code I thought \"whoa, that doesn't\nseem sensible, I need to see what's going on\".\n\nToday I code with Claude Code, git diff, and occasionally vim. I don't\nfeel a need to OK every change in the diff. I've got more important\nthings to do. I suspect that you do too.\n\nI deeply respect the philosophical position of Python, which I'll state as\nfollows:\n\nPrioritize human performance over compute performance.\n\nspace more broadly and more quickly, finding much better solutions, making\nthat 100x drop in performance negligible.\n\nPython was a bold bet, and a bet that paid off amazingly well. No one expected\nthis silly dynamic language originally designed for education to become the\nworld's juggernaut in performance software.\n\nWith AI though, the usability benefits of Python no longer apply as strongly,\nand we're more free to choose different ecosystems.\n\nRegarding TypeScript, I still love easy interaction tools like rich and\ntextual, but when the entire React ecosystem is a sentence away and when you\nget to use things like, you know, fonts, there's really no comparison. Every\ncomputational developer should learn the concepts underpinning React (or some\nother frontend framework), and we should put dashboards on everything.\n\nOf course, I still hook into Python for the ecosystem. Everything is\nPython-importable and I still use the protocols and design patterns developed\n\ncode or the language; those will die. Rest in peace dear friend.\n\nAs an introductory project, I rewrote Numpy in Rust.\nIt was great fun.\n\nIt was also much easier than I expected (I expected it to be impossible).\nIt was easy for a few reasons (good test suite, well-reasoned abstractions) but\nmostly it was because:\n\nNEPs: Numpy's Enhancement Proposals / design documentation is thorough and extremely clear.\n\nWhen sticky problems arose, we were able to rely on the Numpy design documents\n(NEPs) which are excellent.\n\nThe Numpy team thought hard and wrote clearly, two hallmarks of\nexcellent developers. This made the job of reimplementation relatively trivial.\nThe Numpy development community is famous for doing this well. To a certain\nextent, we should all start operating more like the Numpy community.\n\nI keep two directories in each repository:\n\nPlans end up being very useful during development, while docs end\nup being useful to point other agents to in the future. Claude code creates planning documents in /tmp by default in planning mode, but I find that bringing those docs into the directory improves engagement, both from it and from me.\n\nDocs end up being tricky. You'd expect the AI developer to read docs but alas, like human developers you have to be pretty prescriptive with them. Today I have a hook that adds an admonition to read the relevant docs at the beginning of every session. It looks like this:\n\nI then keep docs/README.md updated as a sort of index over my documents. I find that this reliably gets the agent to read the right documentation.\n\nI've also found that my normal writing style (brutal concision + front-loading important content to maintain attention span) isn't necessary with AI. You really can just shove information at them and they absorb it. It's nice 🙂\n\nHistorically software engineers had to both think well and execute well.\nWe were valued both because we could zoom out and consider the impacts of our\narchitecture, and because we could zoom in and implement those choices with\nskill.\n\nOur ability to zoom in and implement code is now obsolete. Our ability to zoom\nout and think well is not. On the contrary, our ability to think well is now\n10x more valuable than it was before, because implementation is now mostly\nfree.\n\nAnd so it's now more important than ever to hone our craft of thought. This\nprobably means less caffeine and more walks through the park.\n\nThe craft of authoring code has transformed time and time again during our\nlives. We remember when object-oriented was cool, or when TDD became a thing,\nor reactive programming models, or dynamic typing languages, or ML, or ...\n\nAs programmers we've opted into a system which changes by its very nature.\nOur job is to automate our job, and to continuously climb the ladder of\nabstraction. AI programming is another step in that evolution, similar to when\ncompilers came about. The code we write with AI probably won't be as good as\nhand-crafted code, but we'll write 10x more of it, and we'll build systems of\nsystems to make it robust and trustworthy, and all of that will make society\nbetter and our jobs way more fun.\n\nI'm looking forward to having way more fun.\n\nAfter writing this a couple friends asked me for a copy of my regex/Python code\nthat replaces Claude's permission system. I'll include it below, but really,\nyou don't need it. Instead, you need to start a conversation with Claude about\nwhat you want and it'll make one just for you.\n\nCode is free these days. Extending the \"AI is like Compilers\" analogy, asking\nfor someone else's script is kind of like asking for someone else's compiled\nbinary. There's no need; just make it yourself. It's trivial.\n\nHere was my original prompt to Claude Code:\n\nI recently wrote this reddit post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1puqrvc/claude_code_annoyingly_asking_for_permissions/\n\nI'm wondering if you have any suggestions on how to resolve this? Adding stuff to CLAUDE.md or permissions to settings.json doesn't seem to be working well enough.\n\nThat, along with subsequent conversation as I've been working, resulted in\nthis Python script\n\nBut really, you're better off working with Claude to make one just for you.\nCode is free now.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk's Grok has limited its AI image generation tool to paying subscribers following widespread backlash about its use to create nonconsensual sexualized images on X of real people, including minors.\n\nMusk and xAI, the company that developed Grok, have faced threats and condemnation from governments around the world after the AI tool was used to digitally alter images of people — mainly women — to remove their clothes and put them in sexualized positions.\n\n\"Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers,\" Grok now replies when tagged with image editing requests on X.\n\nIt means that the majority of users on the social media platform can no longer create images using Grok, and those who do would have their name and payment information on file.\n\nHowever, those who are not paying X subscribers can continue to use Grok to edit images on its stand-alone app and website.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for Britain's Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, told reporters that the move \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment, xAI sent an automatic email response that did not address the issue.\n\nIn late December, some X users started tagging Grok on the social media site and asking it to digitally undress people in photos. The AI tool honored those requests, putting the subjects in bikinis or underwear, and maneuvering their bodies into sexualized positions. Some of the people in the images were minors.\n\nAs more of the AI-generated images flooded the social media site, governments and regulators in the UK, EU, Italy, India, and elsewhere publicly threatened or took action against X and xAI.\n\nStarmer called Grok's sexualized deepfakes \"disgraceful\" and \"unlawful\" in an interview with Greatest Hits Radio this week.\n\nOn January 3, Musk responded to the backlash for the first time, writing in an X post that, \"Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"\n\nThe official X page also pointed users to its policy page, which states it has \"zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation\" and that it removes \"certain media depicting physical child abuse.\"\n\nOn Monday, the UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, told Business Insider that it has \"made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK.\"\n\nIn the US, the Take It Down Act protects against nonconsensual deepfakes, though its domain depends on age and body parts shown. Some states have also passed stricter laws about the spread of deepfakes.",

    "title": "I didn't realize my drinking was unhealthy until I tracked it — using the old government guidelines",
    "description": "According to the new dietary guidelines, Americans are encouraged to \"drink less\" without strict guidance on what constitutes as moderate drinking.",
    "fullText": "On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced its new dietary guidelines. While the advice urged Americans to cut down on added sugars and processed foods as much as possible, its alcohol guidance was vaguer: Just drink less.\n\nIt's a stark departure from exactly a year ago, when a report from former US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy linked alcohol consumption to multiple forms of cancer and shared that even moderate drinking posed health risks.\n\n\"The newly released guidelines do make an important statement: Consuming less alcohol is better for overall health,\" Tiffany Hall, the CEO of Recover Alaska, said in a press conference held by the US Alcohol Policy Alliance, a public health nonprofit, on Wednesday.\n\n\"However, the alcohol section is now much shorter, less specific, and avoids numeric guidance altogether,\" she added.\n\nThe administration cut recommended limits on how much to drink each day. According to the CDC's recent guidance, moderate drinking counts as one drink a day for women and two for men. The new guidelines also omitted warnings about longer-term health risks associated with drinking, though they advise against drinking while pregnant, using other medications, or if you have a history of alcoholism.\n\nWhile I personally find the general guidance easier to maintain than completely abstaining from alcohol (and frankly, a little more comforting), those numbers are what helped me cut back in the first place.\n\nEarly last year, I reviewed my 2024 journal, where I tracked my drinking for the year. When I crunched the numbers, I realized I drank above healthy limits more than half the time. This prompted some lifestyle changes, like alternating with N/A drinks or giving myself a hard cutoff — seven drinks maximum — for the week.\n\nWhile I didn't score perfectly, I significantly slashed my unhealthy drinking in half. With it, I lost fat, saw improvements in my mood, and found it easier to stick to other healthy habits, like reducing my bedtime doomscrolling.\n\nIt's precisely those guardrails that helped me even understand what it would mean to drink less alcohol. Left to my own devices, I thought I was perfectly healthy.\n\nDr. Oz emphasized two key points in his briefing.\n\nOne was that you should not drink alcohol \"in the best-case scenario\" and to try to do so \"very judiciously.\"\n\nHowever, he noted that moderate drinking can be a \"social lubricant,\" in line with how many centenarians around the world regard alcohol: something to enjoy with friends.\n\n\"There's probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way,\" he said.\n\nBroadly, I agree. My drinking habits are entirely social. I enjoy cocktails with friends or splitting a bottle of wine at home with my husband. Among strangers, I'll usually come out of my shell halfway through a second Old Fashioned.\n\nHowever, social drinking is also where I — and many people — end up going too far. I'll have my first margarita, feel euphoric as the alcohol spreads to my brain, decide to have another, and oh, ok, fine, I'll do a shot and sing the first karaoke song.\n\nWithout knowing that I should ideally cap it below seven drinks a week, or that I'm technically binge drinking if I have four or \n\nWhile I haven't gone sober, I've gained so much awareness around my habits. I know my drinking weaknesses (vacations, weddings, cocktails with elaborate garnishes), and how I can cut back even more in 2026.\n\nMy goal is to limit myself to only a few alcoholic beverages a week, so I'm planning to keep those older guidelines in mind. Hall said some of the old guidance can be confusing or outdated. Even if I follow the CDC's guidelines and have only one drink a day, that would still put me (and women following those same rules) at an increased risk of developing breast cancer, which is something for me to consider.\n\nI owe my lifestyle changes all to those guidelines I once found too draconian. It wasn't what I wanted to hear at first, but I'm glad someone told me.",

    "title": "The US military's annual suicide report is missing, and the Pentagon isn't offering any answers",
    "description": "Pentagon reporting on military suicide rates is usually released each fall. Right now, it remains unpublished, with no explanation.",
    "fullText": "A critical data source for US military suicide prevention efforts is late.\n\nThe annual suicide report, which the Department of Defense typically publishes each fall, provides suicide statistics from the previous calendar year that inform Congress, researchers, and senior leaders across the services on efforts to combat military suicide, a persistent problem.\n\nThe defense department is also delayed in releasing its quarterly suicide data for 2025, with the third-quarter figures still unpublished, months later than usual.\n\nBusiness Insider queried the Pentagon in mid-December about the anticipated release date of the annual report.\n\n\"The Department has nothing to announce at this time,\" a department spokesperson replied in an email. \"We will follow up if anything changes.\" When asked again this week why the report is delayed and when it might be published, the Pentagon did not respond.\n\nBusiness Insider sent a separate email query to the Defense Suicide Prevention Office, which releases the report. The office did not respond.\n\nIt is unclear whether the delay is tied to the government shutdown.\n\nThough the data is beneficial, the monthslong delay is unlikely to significantly affect research or prevention efforts, said Ron Kessler, a principal investigator on a long-term Army suicide study and a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School. He said researchers depend more frequently on detailed data that reveals patterns and circumstances around deaths.\n\nThe bigger issue is tied to accountability, public transparency, and oversight, he said.\n\n\"Publishing is letting the outside world know what's going on,\" Keller said. \"And that's useful for holding organizations accountable.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs have each tried to improve suicide prevention efforts, Kessler said, highlighting a project he's involved in that's testing whether artificial intelligence can effectively identify people at risk of suicide. The annual reports reveal the level of progress and show where further work is needed.\n\n\"It's important for the data to be out there,\" Kessler added, \"not to ever be to a point where we say what's not being shown anymore. It's good for the public to be able to say, 'Is the military doing a good job? What's going on?'\"\n\nSuicide deaths among service members rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the most recent publicly available data — from calendar year 2023 — showed a small increase over the year prior. According to the Defense Suicide Prevention Office, military suicide deaths have increased gradually since 2011.\n\nThe 2023 report showed that young enlisted men accounted for the largest share of suicide deaths in the US military. That mirrors broader national trends. American men are nearly four times more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\nFirearms were involved in roughly half of all US suicide deaths in 2023, and previous military reports have repeatedly identified access to firearms as a risk factor, particularly for younger enlisted personnel.\n\nSome military leaders recently emphasized suicide prevention needs during the holiday season. In November, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll directed supervisors across the Army to conduct daily check-ins with their subordinates through mid-January.\n\nThough the initiative was initially lauded, some supervisors and troops online have described the mandatory directive as unintentionally burdensome.\n\nThe broader Pentagon reporting delays coincide with certain organizational changes inside the Army. A September Army memo highlighted plans to disband its directorate responsible for overseeing soldier quality-of-life issues, known as a G-9, citing \"administrative convenience.\" The responsibilities of that office have since been folded into the service's human resources directorate.\n\nArmy spokeswoman Heather J. Hagan confirmed the change to Business Insider on Thursday, adding that the service remains committed to troop and family quality of life.\n\nIt is unclear how the change may affect oversight of soldier well-being or how suicide prevention priorities are being evaluated, as the Pentagon's annual suicide data remains unpublished.",

    "description": "Text messages, emails, and journal entries were part of a trove of documents unsealed in the legal battle between Elon Musk and Sam Altman.",
    "fullText": "More than 100 documents detailing texts, emails, and even diary entries from some of the world's most powerful tech executives were unsealed on Tuesday as part of Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman.\n\nThe documents provide a rare window into the inner workings of Silicon Valley — from late-night texts to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to debates between Altman and Musk about OpenAI's future. The documents also include previously unreleased writing from Nadella, as well as several entries from the personal diary of OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman.\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in 2024, Musk alleges that OpenAI executives misled him when they decided to move the company away from its original nonprofit mission and pursue a profit-oriented structure. Musk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit organization.\n\nOpenAI has denied the allegations and said the billionaire was aware of the company's plans to shift to a for-profit structure.\n\n\"Mr. Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best-resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a California federal judge said there was sufficient evidence for a jury to consider Musk's claim. The two tech execs are now set to face off in court in March, though they could still settle before that.\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed hundreds of pages of newly unsealed documents. Take a look at some of the most interesting details we've found:\n\nThe court documents included snippets from OpenAI cofounder Brockman's diary.\n\nBrockman mused about being \"free\" and owning his \"destiny\" and \"Financially what will take me to $1B?\"\n\nBrockman said during a deposition last year that his \"primary motivation was to the mission,\" and the \"financial reward\" was a secondary consideration.\n\nIn the diary, Brockman broke down the pros and cons of parting ways with Musk. \"Some chance that rejecting Elon will actually lose us Sam. We'll find out tomorrow if doing an override all the way through is palettable,\" the diary read. \"This is the only chance we have to get out from Elon. Is he the 'glorious leader' that I would pick?\"\n\nIn a separate entry, Brockman debated how OpenAI would move forward and turn a profit. \"It all comes down to the money. We can get it from Tesla, probably. We could also probably get it from Google,\" he wrote.\n\nDuring a September deposition, Jared Birchall, who runs Musk's family office and has roles across several of his businesses, was asked about his job at Neuralink.\n\nBirchall said he was only operating as \"the named CFO\" because the brain chip company had recently hired a new head of finance, to whom they had yet to transfer the title.\n\nAccording to a review of LinkedIn profiles, William Sawyer became Neuralink's head of finance in August.\n\nSawyer declined to comment when reached by Business Insider.\n\nMicrosoft's CEO said in a 2025 deposition that his financial advisor had invested some of his money in Neuralink.\n\nNadella said he hadn't talked to Musk about it.\n\nAt another point in the deposition, Nadella described his feelings toward Musk.\n\n\"I mean, Elon is a pretty idiosyncratic guy in the sense he has a lot of opinions on lots of things, but what I have found to be most inspiring is how he goes about building what he does,\" Nadella said.\n\nAccording to a document dated July 10, 2023, Nadella was working on a book called \"An Inflection Point: Mission, transformation, and the dawn of next generation AI.\"\n\nThe document included sample chapters and was co-written by Harvard business professor Marco Iansiti.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said the company has been working with Iansiti and Keystone Research over the years, and didn't end up publishing the book.\n\nMusk emailed Jensen Huang in 2016, asking for one of the company's first supercomputers.\n\n\"Can OpenAI buy one of the early units? The team was asking me about this earlier today,\" Musk wrote.\n\n\"I've not forgotten,\" Huang responded. \"I will make sure OpenAI gets one of the first ones.\"\n\n\"OpenAI is on a path of certain failure relative to Google,\" Musk wrote in a January 2018 email to Altman.\n\n\"There obviously needs to be immediate and dramatic action or everyone except for Google will be consigned to irrelevance,\" he said.\n\nMusk left OpenAI's board in February 2018. At the time, he cited a potential conflict of interest with Tesla and its AI work.\n\n\"To be clear, I have a lot of respect for your abilities and accomplishments, but I am not happy with how things have been managed,\" Musk wrote in the 2018 email. \"Either we fix things and my engagement increases a lot or we don't and I will drop to near zero and publicly reduce my association. I will not be in a situation where the perception of my influence and time doesn't match the reality.\"\n\n\"What happened to Amazon?\" Musk wrote in an August 2016 email to Altman about OpenAI's efforts to negotiate funding from an outside tech company.\n\n\"I think Jeff is a bit of a tool and Satya is not, so I slightly prefer Microsoft, but I hate their marketing dept,\" Musk wrote.\n\nIn response, Altman said Amazon \"started really dicking us around.\"\n\nOpenAI announced a deal with Microsoft in July 2019.\n\nMicrosoft offered Altman a role after the OpenAI CEO was ousted by the company's board in November 2023. Altman's departure spawned an open letter that was signed by hundreds of OpenAI employees who threatened to leave if Altman was not brought back as CEO.\n\n\"Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join,\" a portion of the letter read.\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI's then-CTO, signed the open letter. She addressed Microsoft's support in a text to Nadella.\n\n\"Hi Satya, I know it's super late. Need to call you urgently,\" said the text, which asked Nadella to confirm whether Microsoft planned to offer roles to OpenAI staff.\n\n\"Thx. So sorry. But that is right,\" Nadella responded the following morning.\n\n\"Satya could you please make a public statement soon that shows support for the joint openai team, basically bringing the team together?\" Murati responded. It's very important that we don't lose researchers to Demis or Elon. The technical team is being dragged in so many recruiting directions and a unified front would help immensely.\"\n\n\"i remember seeing you in a tv interview a long time ago (maybe 60 minutes?) where you being attacked by some guys, and you said they were heroes of yours and it was really tough,\" Altman texted Musk in February 2023. \"well, you're my hero and that's what it feels like when you attack OpenAI.\"\n\nAltman also wrote that \"it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai.\"\n\n\"I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake,\" Musk responded.\n\nDo you work for OpenAI or have a tip?

    "description": "I loved visiting Venice in the winter, when the weather was cooler and there were less crowds. Plus, the city was beautifully decorated for Christmas.",
    "fullText": "Mazes of canals, historic architecture, and delicious local cuisine are some of the many things that draw tourists to Venice. Every year, millions of tourists visit this popular destination, many of whom visit during the busy season between April and October.\n\nBut a few years ago, I saw firsthand how overwhelming the city can feel when it's bursting with crowds under the summer heat. So, when my husband and I decided to return in 2024, we visited during the winter holidays instead, and it turned out to be a completely different experience.\n\nHere's why I loved visiting Venice in the winter.\n\nWhen visiting in the winter, the first thing I noticed was that the crowds were visibly smaller. All the experiences tourists come to Venice for, from gondola rides to touring the Doge's Palace, were accessible and could still be booked during our visit.\n\nDuring our summer trip, however, tickets for the Doge's Palace had to be secured weeks in advance, and even then, the queues to enter were long. But in the offseason, the lines were shorter, and the entire city seemed calmer.\n\nWe even had a meal at a local restaurant and were able to strike up conversations with gondoliers. I doubt this would've been possible during the busier summer months.\n\nOne night, when we passed Venice's iconic Rialto Bridge, we saw a small group of travelers congregated there. However, it still wasn't the packed Rialto we had come to expect during our first trip to the city.\n\nI've always thought Venice was beautiful at night, especially after many daytrippers return to the mainland. However, it felt even more magical in the winter. A hush fell across the canals, which sparkled in holiday lights.\n\nBut it wasn't just Venice's hidden canals or remote nooks and alleys that were transformed. Many of the city's most iconic monuments looked different, too.\n\nFor example, during my visit, a gigantic Christmas tree rose above Piazza San Marco, all decked in festive lights. It was a view of Venice's iconic square that I had never experienced before.\n\nThe hush in the air and the spirit of Christmas combined uniquely inside Venice's churches. Nativity scenes were displayed during our trip, accentuating the beautiful Venetian Gothic architectural style.\n\nAnd although St. Mark's Basilica is one of the most popular options in Venice, we found that all the city's churches really seemed to come alive at this time of year.\n\nWe even got to witness a mass in progress at Chiesa di San Simeon Piccolo, a Venetian church built almost 300 years ago. The congregation here was mostly made up of locals, and the quiet spirituality I felt was different from the glossy, touristy version of Venice I'd grown used to.\n\nAlthough many tourists are drawn to exploring Venetian art through a tour of the Doge's Palace, we found our most memorable experiences were in the city's lesser-visited locales.\n\nThe queues at the Doge's Palace were definitely shorter than what we experienced in peak season, but other museums and art galleries, like the Scuola Grande di San Rocco and the interactive Da Vinci museum, were completely empty.\n\nThis meant we had rooms filled with incredible Venetian art to ourselves, sometimes for the entire afternoon.\n\nAlthough snow is rare in Venice, we found the misty winter weather added its own charm to the city.\n\nPlus, it was a nice reprieve from the blistering summer heat I experienced on my last visit. This time, wandering around the city was much more enjoyable. I just carried an umbrella and wore a warm jacket to keep out the cold wind.\n\nTraveling to the city at this time of year truly gave me a glimpse of Venice that the brochures never told me about.",

    "description": "Shawnee Baker's daughter had catastrophic brain injuries and was kept on life support. She didn't have a healthcare proxy allowing her to die.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Shawnee Baker, a safety advocate for students and a former nurse from New Hampshire. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOne afternoon during her senior year in 2017, my 18-year-old high schooler, Baylie Grogan, spoke to me in a serious tone.\n\n\"The only thing worse than dying is living in a body that doesn't work,\" she said. \"Promise me you won't ever let me live that way.\"\n\nIt was shortly before she left home to start college as a pre-med student. \"I promise,\" I replied, agreeing that such a predicament would be horrifying, and I wouldn't want it either.\n\nI could never have imagined that I'd have to fight to keep my promise to my beautiful girl, who sustained catastrophic brain injuries the following year.\n\nMy husband, Scott, and I had no say in the life-or-death medical decisions affecting Baylie, who was given a 1% chance of survival after being struck by a car.\n\nDespite being her next of kin, we were obliged to defer to the ethics committees of two hospitals because she was legally an adult at the age of 19.\n\nOnly we knew how much Baylie would have abhorred the idea of an incapacitated life of pain and isolation. Yet we had no voice.\n\nOur daughter had always been happy, considerate, and responsible. She was friends with everyone. Academically gifted, she planned to be a doctor. She wanted to help others.\n\nHer empathy extended to animals, especially her own horse. She'd go to the barn at 5 a.m. and spend hours with him after school. Her two older brothers and I would often call her in case she missed dinner.\n\nIn the run-up to graduation, she selected the University of Miami as her first choice of college, mostly because it had a renowned equestrian program.\n\nShe loved her time as a freshman and, after spending the summer of 2018 at our home in New Hampshire, studying, lifeguarding, and working part-time, she was ready to return.\n\nIn mid-August, we flew to Miami, where I helped her move into her dorm. We cried when we kissed goodbye. I was three months pregnant at the time, and she thought I might be feeling vulnerable.\n\n\"I love you so much, Mom,\" Baylie said. \"I love you, too,\" I said.\n\nIt was the last time I'd ever get to see the same kind, smart, vivacious Baylie I'd always known, the world at her feet.\n\nJust days later, on August 19, 2018, I received a call from the Miami-Dade police department. \"There's been a terrible accident,\" the officer said. \"Baylie is alive, but you need to come to Miami immediately.\"\n\nHe couldn't give more information over the phone and told us to contact the hospital where she'd been admitted. They said Baylie was in the OR, and the surgeon would call us as soon as he could.\n\nI was distraught and kept asking myself, \"Was she in surgery for a broken pelvis or broken leg, or something more serious? Did she hit her head?\"\n\nWe had a torturous journey south to the hospital in Miami, where Scott and I were shown to Baylie's room.\n\nI'd worked as a nurse in the ER for four years, and my daughter was, by far, the worst patient I'd ever seen. Her face was bruised and bandaged all over. Her body was swollen to four times its size.\n\nShe was on a ventilator, and her hair had been shaved off. There was a C-shaped scar on her scalp from the brain surgery and tubes coming out of her head. I ran to the bathroom and vomited in shock.\n\nThe police informed us that Baylie had been caught on traffic cameras crossing six lanes of I-95 on foot in the early hours of the morning. She'd been hit by a car after becoming separated from her friends on a night out.\n\nI tried my best to hold out hope, but it seemed pointless. Baylie's brain activity was barely detectable, and her pupils were unresponsive to light. They were signs of irreversible brain damage.\n\nShe was later transferred by plane to a Boston hospital that was closer to our home. The neurological team detected a so-called Duret hemorrhage in her brain, a bleed that almost certainly signals full incapacitation.\n\nWe knew that, in the 1% chance she survived, she would be in a persistent vegetative state — the scenario I'd promised not to allow.\n\nScott and I hit hurdles from the very beginning. We didn't have the legal right to request a toxicology report when she was admitted on August 19, which may have helped address our questions about whether she'd been drugged. \n\nBaylie had never completed an advance directive, healthcare proxy, or HIPAA waiver, which are available to adults 18 and over. Obtaining guardianship through the courts was likely to take months.\n\nWe were not allowed to see her medical records or make important decisions about her care.\n\nWithout a healthcare proxy or DNR order, she was repeatedly resuscitated by default. In hindsight, I wish we hadn't taken those measures, no matter how heroic the hospital staff was. Baylie was meant to leave us the day she got hit by the car, but her suffering was prolonged.\n\nThe ethics committees of both hospitals were there at every turn. Appointed to make decisions on Baylie's behalf, it was up to strangers — not us — to judge whether her quality of life justified being taken off life support.\n\nI felt not only grief, but also frustration about letting Baylie down. We were powerless, despite the knowledge that our daughter would hate the semblance of a life under 24-hour supervision in a long-term care facility, unable to open her eyes, feed herself, or recognize her family.\n\nShe had a functional MRI, and the committee decided to interview 10 people who knew Baylie well. The members asked them if she would want to suffer under those conditions. Everyone said no.\n\nThere was more back and forth, but we finally heard that Baylie could be moved to palliative care on September 24. It was unbearable, but she died with dignity and without suffering on September 27. I'd kept my promise.\n\nThe last seven years have been hard. I miss Baylie every day. I gave birth to Baylie's little sister, Savannah, in 2019, and her youngest sibling, Seraphina, two years later. They have brought much joy and laughter.\n\nWe vowed to honor Baylie's memory and founded Baylie's Wish Foundation. It advises students to take a few minutes to complete documents, such as healthcare proxies and HIPAA waivers, so that their loved ones can respect their wishes if a medical crisis were to happen.\n\nYou can download relevant forms for each state from our website for free. We want colleges to automatically include them in the paperwork sent to incoming students.\n\nI know that Baylie would be proud of the campaign in her name. She wanted to help people. We're seeing that through.\n\nEditor's note: Business Insider contacted the hospitals that treated Baylie Grogan and is awaiting a response.",

    "fullText": "The very first Golden Globes were held on January 20, 1944, to celebrate the films of 1943.\n\nOver the last eight decades, the Golden Globes have evolved to include television, have endured a few scandals, and — after a one-year hiatus in 2022 — are one of the first major events of Hollywood's awards season.\n\nThese photos were taken across the Globes' 82 years in existence. See how the ceremony has changed.\n\nThe first ceremony was held at the 20th Century Fox lot. It then moved around for two decades until finding its permanent home, the Beverly Hills Hilton, in 1961.\n\nIn 1952, Barbara Stanwyck chatted with fellow screen icon Gilbert Roland.\n\nRoland was nominated the following year for his part in \"The Bad and the Beautiful.\"\n\nStanwyck wouldn't receive a Golden Globe nomination until 1966, and she was given the Cecil B. DeMille Award, a lifetime achievement award, in 1986.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, over 7,500 glasses of bubbly are normally consumed over the course of the night.\n\nIt leads to iconic table-mates like Judy Garland and Marlon Brando, who sat next to each other at the 1955 awards.\n\nThey both took home statues that night: her for best actress in \"A Star is Born\" and him for best actor in \"On the Waterfront.\"\n\nMacLaine is part of a Hollywood dynasty — her brother is Warren Beatty.\n\nKelly won the now-discontinued award for world film favorite (female) in 1956.\n\nShe retired from acting that same year when she married Prince Rainier III of Monaco and became the Princess Consort of Monaco.\n\nDeMille, pictured talking to French actor Corinne Calvet in 1952, is known for directing and producing some of the most famous films of all time, including \"The Ten Commandments,\" \"Cleopatra,\" and \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\"\n\nThis year's Cecil B. DeMille Award honoree is Helen Mirren.\n\nIn 2026, this would be the equivalent of DeuxMoi sitting with George and Amal Clooney ...\n\nThe 1958 awards were held in February. Todd died one month later in a plane crash.\n\nWhile grieving, Taylor and Fisher, one of Todd's best friends, began an affair, leading to the divorce of Hollywood golden couple Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.\n\nThese two have a famous daughter of their own, Mariska Hargitay, who is best known as Olivia Benson of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"\n\nHargitay directed a documentary about her famous mother, \"My Mom Jayne,\" in 2025, in which she revealed that Mickey Hargitay isn't her biological father.\n\nThat same year, she won her fourth and final Golden Globe, for world film favorite (female). Previously, Monroe won the best young box office personality in 1951 and the world film favorite (female) in 1953. She died just five months later, in August 1962.\n\nIn 2023, Ana de Armas was nominated for best actress in a motion picture (drama) for playing Monroe in \"Blonde.\"\n\nWayne held Martin's drink as the singer/actor presented a Golden Globe during the show.\n\nOne of the most iconic moments in award-show history was when she famously shaded Jack Warner, the man who didn't cast her in \"My Fair Lady.\"\n\nWhen the stage musical \"My Fair Lady\" was made into a movie, Warner, head of Warner Bros. studios, decided to cast Audrey Hepburn as the lead, even though Andrews had played the role on Broadway and in London.\n\nThis snub proved to be a blessing, as it freed up Andrews for what might be her most iconic role of all time: Mary Poppins.\n\nWhen Andrews won her Golden Globe in 1965, she thanked \"the man who made all this possible in the first place, Mr. Jack Warner.\"\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" star and his wife have been married for more than 40 years.\n\nThe duo's show, \"The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour,\" was nominated for best television series musical or comedy in both 1973 and 1974.\n\nWood and Redford, who died in 2025, met in high school and starred in a few movies together, such as 1966's \"This Property Is Condemned,\" according to an appearance by Redford on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nThe Jackson 5's album \"Skywriter\" was released in 1973.\n\nA Michael Jackson biopic, simply titled \"Michael,\" will hit theaters in 2026.\n\nHudson and Day were both chosen as the \"world's favorite performers\" multiple times.\n\nWe'll see if any couples make their red-carpet debut on Sunday.\n\nMack and Selleck have been married for 39 years.\n\nBack in 1968, Dustin Hoffman won the now-defunct award for new star of the year.\n\nHoffman won for his breakthrough performance in \"The Graduate\" when he was 30 years old.\n\nAt 27 years old, it was her first Golden Globe nomination and win.\n\nNow, Streisand is one of a few people to have received an EGOT — an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award — though not all of them were competitive awards.\n\nSchwarzenegger wouldn't be nominated again until 1995 for \"Junior.\"\n\nTravolta was nominated for his role in \"Saturday Night Fever\" but lost. He would be nominated multiple times and scored a win in 1996 for \"Get Shorty.\"\n\nHe was nominated for 12 in total.\n\nLansbury won for best performance by an actress in a TV series drama for her role in \"Murder, She Wrote.\" She died in 2022 at 96 years old.",

    "description": "We took a long, international flight on Singapore Airlines' business class. For my family, the best part was the food, but I had issues with the seat.",
    "fullText": "When I booked a family trip from Copenhagen to Singapore, I knew we were facing a 13-hour overnight flight.\n\nFlying with my husband and our 7-year-old son meant comfort wasn't just a luxury — it was a necessity. So, we splurged on business class, using points to bring the cost down to something we could justify.\n\nHere's what it was like — the highs, the lows, and the key thing that made it worthwhile.\n\nA deal popped up on discount search engine seats.aero that seemed too good to pass up: Singapore Airlines business-class seats from Copenhagen to Singapore, bookable through Air Canada's Aeroplan program, for just 80,000 points per person.\n\nSingapore Airlines has a reputation for having one of the best business-class experiences in the world, and the thought of spending 13 hours in lie-flat comfort — especially with a child — was incredibly appealing.\n\nWe transferred our American Express points to Air Canada and booked the seats, paying only about $100 per person in taxes and fees.\n\nThat flight, which could easily cost over $15,000 for three passengers, cost us just over $300 out of pocket.\n\nWhen we boarded the Airbus A350-900, the first thing I noticed was how wide the seats looked. At about 28 inches wide, there was plenty of room for my husband and me, and our son could stretch out without feeling cramped.\n\nEven better, the seats were equipped with numerous compartments — small storage areas for headphones, snacks, books, and charging devices.\n\nAs a parent, I loved being able to keep things organized instead of digging through one overflowing bag the entire flight.\n\nI loved that you could control the seatback setup either directly on the screen or with a pull-out remote. That flexibility made it simple for all of us to watch what we wanted.\n\nThe complimentary noise-canceling headphones were another highlight. They blocked out the hum of the cabin, allowing me actually to enjoy a movie without distraction.\n\nThe food turned out to be one of the highlights of the flight. I started with stuffed chicken paired with potatoes and mushrooms — a flavorful and surprisingly restaurant-quality dish.\n\nWe also tried the oriental-style braised beef cheek, which was tender and rich.\n\nBeyond the formal meal service, there was also an \"anytime\" menu. At any point during the flight, you could order a sandwich, a bowl of egg-noodle soup, or a variety of small snacks.\n\nWe didn't lean on it this time, but as a parent, I loved knowing it was there in case my son got hungry outside of meal times.\n\nAnother unexpected perk: I was able to order a proper latte in the morning. Usually, I avoid airplane coffee altogether, but this was actually good — smooth, not burnt-tasting, and served with a bit of flair in a real mug.\n\nIt felt like a small luxury, but after hours in the air, it made a big difference.\n\nFor me, one downside was the way the seat converted into a bed.\n\nInstead of just reclining with a button, we had to stand up and have the flight attendant flip our seats over. Not great when you're already half-asleep.\n\nAnd once it was a bed, the surface felt surprisingly firm. Since I have back problems, this was not ideal, and it was challenging to find a comfortable position.\n\nHowever, it was certainly better than sleeping upright.\n\nThe lie-flat seat sort of forces your legs into a diagonal position, which can make it difficult to relax during such a long flight.\n\nMy husband and I both found ourselves shifting around trying to get comfortable.\n\nFor our son, though, it was perfect. The smaller frame of a 7-year-old fit right into the angled nook, and he slept soundly while we tossed and turned.\n\nWould I pay cash for this flight? Probably not — the angled footwell and hard bed weren't quite worth the usual five-figure price tag.\n\nHowever, this flight was absolutely worth spending points on.\n\nThe wide seats, smart storage, strong entertainment system, tasty meals, and polished service all combined to make the journey manageable — especially with a child in tow.\n\nAnd arriving in Singapore rested enough to start exploring right away was the ultimate payoff.",

    "fullText": "Meta Platforms is turning to nuclear power to drive its AI ambitions, and its latest deal with a trio of companies is sending stocks in the sector soaring.\n\nThe tech giant revealed that it signed an agreement with several companies to help supply nuclear power for its data centers, including the massive Prometheus AI supercluster being built in New Albany, Ohio. The one gigawatt facility is expected to come online later this year.\n\nThe three companies that will help power it are Oklo, Vistra Corp, and privately held TerraPower. Both nuclear power stocks surged on news of the Meta deal, sparking momentum for many of their peers as well.\n\nHere are the big moves in the space on Friday:\n\nThis isn't the first nuclear power deal that Meta has inked. Last summer, it announced a similar agreement with Constellation Energy, which saw its shares spike on the news.\n\n\"State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America's position as a global leader in AI,\" said Joel Kaplan, chief of global affairs at Meta. \"Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country's energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone.\"\n\nBig tech's support of nuclear energy has risen in recent years as experts have touted the need for alternative sources of power to enable the AI buildout. Oklo is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, though he stepped down from his position as chairman of its board of directors in August 2025.\n\n\"Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio,\" Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte said. \"Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta.\"",

    "fullText": "The US military said on Friday that it \"apprehended\" an oil tanker in a pre-dawn operation in the Caribbean Sea, marking the fifth seizure of a Venezuela-linked vessel allegedly operating in violation of sanctions.\n\nUS Southern Command said in a statement that Marines and sailors, working in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, launched from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and captured the tanker, Olina, \"without incident.\"\n\nIt appears to be the first time that the US has directly acknowledged the Ford's involvement in the five boarding and seizure operations that began in early December. However, the government has indicated that the carrier was used for at least one of the other missions.\n\nThe Ford is the Navy's largest, newest, and most advanced aircraft carrier. It carries dozens of embarked fighter jets, early warning planes, and helicopters and was deployed to the Caribbean in the fall as part of the massive build-up of military forces in the region.\n\nLast year, the US imposed sanctions on Olina, which was flying the flag of Panama and named Minerva M at the time, according to a Treasury Department document.\n\nData from MarineTraffic, a ship-tracking site, showed that the tanker was off Venezuela's coast several weeks ago and was sailing under the flag of Timor-Leste.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Olina a \"ghost fleet\" tanker that was suspected of carrying embargoed oil and \"had departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces.\"\n\nThe US announced a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela last month as part of an effort to pressure the country's then-President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe operation on Friday marks the third tanker seizure this week. US forces captured two vessels on Wednesday: one in the North Atlantic after a dramatic, weekslong chase and another near the Caribbean. The American military boarded two other vessels — Skipper and Centuries — last month.\n\n\"The ghost fleets will not outrun justice. They will not hide under false claims of nationality,\" Noem said on Friday, adding that the US will continue to seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nThe Trump administration's pressure campaign against Maduro and Venezuela, which included the naval blockade, also consisted of the deployment of warships, military aircraft, and thousands of troops to the Caribbean.\n\nSince early September, US forces have carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats, with President Donald Trump routinely suggesting that he may take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated last weekend in a dramatic surprise operation and raid to capture the former Venezuelan president.\n\nIn the days since, Trump has threatened additional action against neighboring countries, including Mexico, Cuba, and Colombia.\n\nA US official told Business Insider on Thursday that the 12 Navy warships deployed to the Caribbean before the Maduro raid were still in the region, with no scaling down of forces yet.",

    "description": "Torsten Sløk, who frequently warned of stagflation in 2025, said he now estimates the odds of a recession in 2026 to be about 10%.",
    "fullText": "An economist who spent much of 2025 warning of a worst-case scenario for the US economy is sounding a bit more upbeat as 2026 kicks off.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said he believed the US is now on track to avoid stagflation, a dire situation where inflation runs hot while economic growth is sluggish.\n\nMeanwhile, he's also slashed his estimated risk of a recession to just 10% — below the 30% odds markets are currently pricing in, he said, speaking to CNBC on Thursday.\n\n\"It's getting more and more difficult to be bearish on the economic outlook,\" Sløk said. \"We're moving from that stagflationary outlook that most people had going into this year, to now turn into instead, an overheating outlook.\"\n\nIt's a change of tune for Sløk, who has long warned of a potential recession and was one of the first on Wall Street to sound the stagflation alarm last year. Stagflation is often referred to as one of the worst-case scenarios for the economy, and even harder for policymakers to resolve than a typical recession, as high inflation prevents the Fed from cutting interest rates to stimulate economic activity.\n\nBut the situation looks different heading into 2026, thanks to multiple tailwinds that are expected to carry growth higher — taking away the \"stag\" out of the stagflation dilemma.\n\nSløk pointed to catalysts like greater certainty around tariffs, a cheaper US dollar, the AI-related investment boom, and stimulus in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill. The bill is expected to add nearly 1% in GDP growth in 2026 alone, he estimated.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Sløk wrote that the US economy now appeared to be in \"great shape\" heading into 2026. He pointed to recent growth in weekly GDP data and same-store retail sales, which reflect strength in the economy and the US consumer in particular.\n\n\"It is indeed the case that this stagflationary scenario is beginning to become more the issue that we had in the last few months, and we are beginning to turn more optimistic on the outlook as we look into 2026,\" he added.\n\nThat outlook aligns with other forecasters on Wall Street, who are more optimistic about a \"run-it-hot\" year ahead for markets. Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs are among the top banks that also think the economy looks like it's on track for a high-growth, high-inflation regime.\n\nSløk has frequently revised his economic and recession outlook over the past year. In late 2024, he estimated that the US had a 0% chance of recession over the next 12 months, and later, raised his predicted odds of a recession to 90% as tariffs sparked chaos in global markets.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump's Secret Service code name is \"Mogul,\" and first lady Melania Trump's is \"Muse.\" Here's what other presidents have been called.",
    "fullText": "Secret Service code names, which Secret Service agents use when communicating about the security of the first family, are among the worst-kept secrets in Washington.\n\nThough they're meant to be secret, the code names quickly become public either through government filings, sources who leak them to news outlets, or when agents are overheard at public events. Since new technology has allowed security agents to monitor officials in a variety of ways, the names aren't so top-secret anymore.\n\nThe White House Communications Agency assigns each member of the first family a code name for Secret Service agents to use during their time in the White House. These names come from a list of agency-approved choices that either the president chooses from or agents pick.\n\nOther members of the family are then assigned names that share the same first letter. Sometimes, it's the same letter as the family's last name, but not always.\n\nHere are the Secret Service code names used by the past 12 presidents and first ladies.\n\nKennedy's code name harkens back to Lancelot, one of King Arthur's heroic Knights of the Round Table. After his death, Jacqueline Kennedy popularized the moniker \"Camelot\" in reference to his presidency.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's code name was fitting for her image as one of the most elegant residents in the history of the White House, who wore lace for her high-profile wedding and during events like a widely covered state visit to France.\n\nJohnson kept the same Secret Service code name that he used as Kennedy's vice president.\n\nLady Bird Johnson was a woman of many names. Her birth name was Claudia Alta Taylor, but a nursemaid nicknamed her Lady Bird, according to the White House Historical Association. To the Secret Service, she was known as Victoria.\n\nNixon's given code name adds an ironic tinge to his legacy in the context of the night raid that set off the Watergate scandal and led to his resignation.\n\nPat Nixon chose the code name \"Starlight,\" corresponding to her husband's choice of \"Searchlight.\"\n\nFord used the same Secret Service code name when he served as vice president under Nixon.\n\nA pinafore is a type of women's dress, but Betty Ford famously wore pants while dancing on top of the Cabinet Room table on her last day as first lady in 1977.\n\nCarter's open devotion to his Christian faith made this codename spot-on. After his retirement from politics, Carter even spent time teaching Sunday school.\n\nRosalynn Carter also used the code name \"Lotus Petal.\"\n\nThe former actor had appeared as a cowboy on-screen, but Reagan's passion for all things Western also shaped his image as president.\n\nThe code name \"Rainbow\" was a nod to Nancy Reagan's affinity for wearing bright colors.\n\nSome of Bush's Secret Service agents served as pallbearers at his funeral in 2018, AP reported.\n\nAfter her death, former Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow wrote for CNN that her code name \"exemplified her demeanor and its calming, humanizing and gentle effect on those around her.\"\n\nThough he never reached the rank of Eagle during his time as a Boy Scout, Clinton was given the patriotic code name.\n\nHillary Clinton's codename used during the 2016 presidential election was the same security code name that she had during her time in the White House.\n\nBush originally used the code name \"Tumbler\" when his father was president. It was changed to \"Trailblazer\" when he became president.\n\nThe Bushes' twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna, went by the code names \"Turquoise\" and Twinkle.\"\n\nThough the name matched the bold optimism of Obama's campaign, the president reportedly just chose his favorite from an approved list of proposed words that started with the letter \"r.\"\n\nThe Obamas' daughters, Malia and Sasha, were known as \"Radiance\" and \"Rosebud.\"\n\nBiden's Secret Service code name served as a tribute to his Irish Catholic heritage. He also used the code name \"Celtic\" as vice president.\n\nJill Biden also kept her Secret Service code name from her time as second lady.\n\nThough he said in a 2015 candidate debate that he would choose the name \"Humble\" for himself, the one he was ultimately assigned was likely inspired by decades spent in a real-estate dynasty handed down from his father. Trump has used the same code name during both of his terms.\n\nIt's been suggested the first lady's name refers to her career in front of the camera as a model in New York City before she met her mogul husband.\n\nThe name of Melania Trump's production company, Muse Films, is a nod to her Secret Service code name. Muse Films will release the documentary \"MELANIA,\" which chronicles the lead-up to Trump's 2025 inauguration, on January 30.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance is still trying to stop Warner Bros. Discovery's Netflix deal. Here are the four most likely endings in the fight for WBD.",
    "fullText": "The war for Warner Bros. Discovery is getting intense.\n\nParamount Skydance isn't surrendering in its quest to buy WBD, even though its offers have been rejected eight times in favor of Netflix's bid.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison has criticized WBD for not selecting what he's called \"by far the superior offer.\"\n\nWBD has fired back, accusing Paramount of threatening lawsuits and leaking to the press. The company's board of directors said this week in a letter to shareholders that Paramount \"has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction.\"\n\nThere have been many twists and turns in Netflix and Paramount's battle for WBD, and the drama isn't over yet.\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios that could unfold.\n\nAlthough Paramount says its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD provides more value and less risk than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets, the company could up the ante.\n\nSeveral media insiders, including Disney's former top dealmaker, expect a renewed bidding war for WBD.\n\nTheir view got a boost when Paramount disclosed in a filing that Ellison had texted WBD CEO David Zaslav, saying that Paramount's $30-per-share proposal wasn't its \"best and final\" offer.\n\nWBD investors also seem to be counting on more fireworks, given that its stock is trading north of $28.50, close to $1 per share above Netflix's agreed-upon purchase price. That suggests shareholders believe either Ellison and company or Netflix will fork over more money before WBD changes hands.\n\nParamount might not need to offer another penny if a majority of WBD's shareholders tender their shares, which would put pressure on the board to reconsider its proposal.\n\nAs a public company, WBD's leadership is legally required to act in the best interests of its shareholders. Otherwise, its board could be sued. So, if WBD's investors overwhelmingly prefer Paramount's bid, the board could have no choice but to go with it.\n\nHowever, Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners, thinks Paramount won't convince a majority of WBD shareholders to tender their shares. Greenfield predicted that Paramount would then raise its offer to $32 per share, but that Netflix would respond by sweetening its offer, leading to Paramount eventually dropping its bid.\n\nUntil the Netflix deal closes, a competing proposal could come in, since WBD is a public company. Comcast drove up the eventual price of Disney's acquisition of Fox's studio by nearly $20 billion, even though its rival bid came in six months later.\n\nIf Paramount remains adamant that it has a superior proposal that wasn't chosen, it could sue WBD's board of directors, alleging negligence.\n\nWBD has acknowledged that possibility. Paramount \"has been aggressive in its engagement with WBD, has retained litigation counsel and has threatened litigation,\" WBD's board of directors wrote in a letter on Wednesday in which it rejected Paramount's latest offer.\n\nLawyer Raul Gastesi of Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella has taken note of Paramount's litigious posture and said that now that it has been turned down, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit.\"\n\nHowever, Reuben Miller, the head of antitrust at data intelligence firm Dealreporter, said that while Paramount is making waves in the court of public opinion, he believes they \"would rather come with an increased offer and avoid litigation than roll the dice in Delaware court.\"\n\nEven if Paramount decides not to sue, there's a chance WBD shareholders could take legal action against WBD's board.\n\nWhile Paramount has taken a hands-on approach to its WBD bid so far, it could let the chips fall and move on if its proposal doesn't win over enough WBD shareholders.\n\nInstead of spending more than $100 billion on WBD, Paramount could put money toward another acquisition, or simply invest in improving its technology and original content.",

Prior to Friday's report, the totals for private and public sector jobs would not have been the same as the ones included in the chart.\n\nOn Friday morning, economists were able to connect the dots following the release of the December jobs report to the public.\n\nThe US added 50,000 jobs in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly report. The increase was less than expected. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.4%.\n\nHistorically, presidents are briefed a day ahead of the report's publication.

    "description": "An analysis from S&P Global predicts that the AI boom will drive demand higher for years at a time when supply is expected to remain constrained.",
    "fullText": "Copper joined the mega rally in precious and industrial metals in 2025, but the gains might be far from over if recent forecasts for supply and demand prove correct.\n\nCopper ended 2025 with a gain of about 44%, and touched a fresh all-time high this week. Yet, the AI boom might be the key to another 15 years of surging demand at a time when supply is expected to remain constrained.\n\nS&P Global recently published an analysis of the copper market, predicting that demand is likely to increase by 50% by 2040, reaching 42 million metric tons. The report also said that it will be extremely difficult for the mining industry to keep up as companies struggle with aging mines and regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe authors predict that, without new mines or technological advancements, copper production will peak in 2030, leaving the world short of roughly 10 million metric tons by 2040.\n\n\"Several countries have deemed copper a 'critical metal' over the past half decade, including, in 2025, the United States. And with good reason,\" said Carlos Pascual, Senior Vice President, Geopolitics and International Affairs, at S&P Global Energy. \"Copper is the connective artery linking physical machinery, digital intelligence, mobility, infrastructure, communication and security systems.\"\n\nCopper benefited from a broad rush into metals last year that also pushed gold and silver to record highs. Some forecasters have said they think prices for all three metals are likely to decline in the near future as market conditions shift, but copper's industrial importance could continue to buoy it.\n\nJosé Torres, chief economist at Interactive Brokers, said he thinks copper's global strategic importance means prices will remain elevated.\n\n\"Broadly, it has to do with limited supply as nations want to stockpile the cyclical metal to bolster sovereign AI prospects,\" he told Business Insider. \"Governments are afraid that without enough copper, their economies won't remain competitive in a world where advanced technology is increasingly adopted.\"\n\nRita Adiani, president and CEO of rare earth mining company Titan Mining Corporation, believes that a surge in demand, as predicted by S&P, would lead to a period of higher prices.\n\n\"A significant part of the incremental demand is tied to electrification, grid build, data centers/AI and defense, where copper's conductivity and reliability makes substitution harder in critical applications.\"",

    "description": "Protein, dairy, and so-called \"healthy\" fats are the foundational elements of the new dietary guidelines. But what is a \"healthy\" fat, anyway?",
    "fullText": "US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says his diet message is clear: \"Eat real food.\"\n\nThat was his main mantra during a White House press briefing on the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released Wednesday.\n\nThe new guidelines feature an inverted pyramid, with protein, dairy, and so-called \"healthy fats\" as the foundational corner of the new American diet.\n\n\"Protein and healthy fats are essential, and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines,\" Kennedy said.\n\nIf you're trying to eat healthier, the problem isn't that you need more fat — it's that \"healthy fat\" is a vague term that means very different things depending on the source.\n\nBut what is a healthy fat, exactly? Here's how nutrition experts say to tell the difference, and how to use that information when you shop, cook, and eat.\n\nThe new federal guidelines don't provide a strict definition of \"healthy\" fat, only saying that healthy fats come from whole foods.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services multiple times, asking for a clear definition of \"healthy\" fat, but didn't get an answer.\n\nTypically, when nutritionists talk about healthy fat, what they mean is sources that have:\n\nTake olives. An olive is a fruit that includes a mix of both unsaturated and — to a much lesser extent — saturated fats. It also has other nutrients in it, including fiber, iron, and vitamin E, plus plant chemicals called polyphenols, which are good for your brain. That's why olive oil is widely regarded as a healthy choice.\n\nThe same goes for chia seeds. They're high in omega-3 fatty acids, an essential fatty acid that we need to consume because we can't make it on our own. They're naturally low in saturated fat, and also provide other nutritional benefits, including decent doses of both fiber and protein.\n\nWalnuts provide another great example. Until the 1990s, they were thought to be bad for your heart, due to their high fat content. It turns out the opposite is true: walnuts are packed with polyunsaturated omega-3s, making them actively good for your heart.\n\nDr. Joan Sabaté, who pioneered that walnut research in the 90s, said the key is to think about your fats in a broader context, not just focusing on one metric.\n\n\"It's not only the type of fat, but the source of the fat, and how the fat is together with [other nutrients],\" Sabaté, a Blue Zone epidemiologist who directs the Center for Nutrition, Lifestyle and Disease Prevention at Loma Linda University, told Business Insider.\n\nUnveiling the new guidelines, Kennedy said, \"We are ending the war on saturated fats.\"\n\nThe new food pyramid features beef, butter, and whole milk high up.\n\n\"Eating a little bit of animal products is good,\" Sabaté said. Red meat and full-fat dairy are packed with nutrients like vitamin B12 and iron, for example, which is hard to find in plants. Experts agree that a little saturated fat is not that bad for your body.\n\nStill, it's controversial that the new guidelines front-load meat and animal products as \"healthy\" fats, and mention them first.\n\nMeat and dairy contain significantly more saturated fat than plants like olives and avocados. Research has linked diets rich in red meat and dairy to a higher incidence of chronic health issues, including heart disease and cancer. Animal products are also more pro-inflammatory than whole grains and vegetables.\n\n\"That is not the way to go,\" Sabaté said, echoing concerns that many health experts shared this week.\n\n(Plus, the new guidelines still recommend limiting your saturated fat consumption to 10% of total daily calories, which means you can't actually live on a diet of butter, red meat, and cream.)\n\nSo, what should you cook with tonight?\n\nMost days, consider swapping butter for olive oil in your frying pan. That will mean more heart-healthy fats get in your system.\n\nThe best change you can make, though, is to curb ultra-processed snacks. Packaged cakes and cookies are often loaded with saturated fat from cooking oils. If you had a buttery steak for dinner, and skipped after-dinner snacks, that could be a good thing.\n\nDon't fear fat — but don't center your diet on it either.",

    "fullText": "Someone made hundreds of thousands of dollars off a well-timed bet on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's political future.\n\nNow, a congressman wants to block government officials from being able to do the same.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York on Friday introduced a bill called the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026, which would bar federal elected officials, political appointees, Executive Branch employees, and congressional staff from making trades on prediction markets when they have nonpublic information related to the transaction, or might be able to obtain it via their official duties.\n\n30 House Democrats are cosponsoring the bill, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California.\n\nLast Friday, a newly created account on Polymarket, a prediction market platform, bet $30,000 that Maduro would be out of office by January 31, 2026.\n\nThe next day, after Maduro's capture, the user netted a $436,759.61 prize.\n\nPolymarket does not currently have significant restrictions or rules against insider trading. In fact, CEO Shayne Coplan has argued that insider trading via prediction markets can be a public good.\n\n\"What's cool about Polymarket is that it creates this financial incentive for people to go and divulge the information to the market,\" Coplan said at an Axios Business event.\n\nPolymarket did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nAccording to the company, a government official would have been forbidden from making the Maduro trade. That's because the platform's rulebook bars \"decision-makers\" who \"have any influence\" on the outcome of an event from making trades related to it. The company also has safeguards in place to prevent insider trading.\n\nEarlier this week, Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour endorsed Torres's bill.\n\n\"Why? Because we already implement it,\" Mansour wrote on LinkedIn.\n\nThis isn't the first time that fears of insider trading have cropped up around a major Trump administration action.\n\nIn April, as President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement caused a significant swing in the stock market, some administration officials and members of Congress made well-timed stock trades.\n\nBelow is the text of Torres's forthcoming bill, courtesy of his office:",

    "fullText": "ROME, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Europe should reopen dialogue with Russia, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday, adding that it was far too soon to ​discuss welcoming Moscow back into the Group of Eight leading nations.\n\nMeloni said she ‌agreed with French President Emmanuel Macron, who recently called for Europe to engage with Moscow as efforts continue to ‌end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I think Macron is right on this. I believe the time has come for Europe to also speak with Russia,\" she said at her traditional New Year's press conference.\n\n\"Because if Europe decides to take part in this phase of negotiations by talking only to ⁠one of the two sides, I ‌fear that in the end the positive contribution it can make will be limited,\" she added.\n\nTalks to bring the almost four-year war to an ‍end have accelerated since November. However, Moscow has yet to signal willingness to make concessions after Kyiv pushed for changes to a U.S. proposal that initially backed Russia's main demands.\n\nMoscow has also given no ​public sign that it would accept a peace deal with the security guarantees envisaged ‌by Ukraine's allies, including having Western troops inside Ukraine.\n\nMeloni said the European Union should appoint an envoy to deal directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and avoid confusion.\n\n\"If we were to make the mistake of deciding, on the one hand, to reopen dialogue with Russia, and on the other, to proceed in a disorganised way, we would be doing Putin a favour,\" ⁠she said. \"We have had this problem from the start. ​Too many voices speaking, too many formats,\" she added.\n\nAmong ​proposals put forward by the United States in November was for Russia to be readmitted to the Group of Seven wealthy nations club, reviving the ‍now-defunct G8.\n\nMeloni said it ⁠was \"absolutely premature\" to talk about welcoming Russia back into the G7 fold. She also reiterated that Italy had no intention of sending troops to Ukraine to help guarantee ⁠any peace deal.\n\nFrance and Britain last month signed a declaration of intent on the future deployment of multinational ‌forces into Ukraine once a ceasefire is reached.",

    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nIn 1927, Albert Einstein and Neils Bohr debated the nature of what’s known as complementarity—the idea that a photon’s dual wave-like and particle natures can’t be measured at the same time.\n\nNow, two unrelated-but-similar experiments confirm that, in a double-slit experiment, detection of a photon’s path (its particle nature) would wash out its interference pattern (its wave nature), proving Bohr right.\n\nUsing these experimental set-ups could help scientists probe other questions of the quantum realm, including the nitty-gritty details of the interaction between decoherence and entanglement.\n\nThe 1920s were an incredible time for science. The decade—prefaced by the stunning confirmation of Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, thanks to the solar eclipse in May of 1919—saw the confirmation of the existence of other galaxies, the discovery of penicillin, and the birth of modern quantum mechanics. A complete banger of a decade, scientifically speaking.\n\nHowever, this plethora of science knowledge came with some understandable disagreements. For example, it was becoming increasingly clear that Einstein’s elegant theories that appeared to govern the universe on a macro scale didn’t perfectly square with the quantum weirdness being discovered at the subatomic scale. One of the most famous debates of the decade involved arguably two of the greatest physicists of the century: Einstein himself and Neils Bohr, the world-famous Danish theoretical physicist who is a foundational figure in quantum mechanics. The matter in question was the idea of “complementarity,” which stated (in simple terms) that a photon’s particle and wave nature can’t be measured at the same time.\n\nEinstein believed that, by using a complicated double-slit experiment involving a spring that recoils when a photon enters, one could learn about that photon’s particle nature based on which slit it entered and its wave nature based on the interference pattern. Bohr disagreed, stating that the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle essentially made this detection impossible.\n\nNow, in two back-to-back experiments—both published in the journal Physical Review Letters—scientists at MIT and the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) have seemingly settled the matter in favor of Bohr. Earlier this year, Wolfgang Ketterle (along with colleagues at MIT) created what the study authors call an “idealized version of the double slit experiment,” in which they used individual atoms as slits and weak beams of light so that those atoms scattered only one photon. Ketterle and his team essentially discovered an inverse relationship between the photon’s two states: the more information that was obtained about the photon’s path (i.e. particle nature), the lower the visibility of the interference pattern (i.e. wave nature).\n\nThe USTC experiment, which probes the same debate through different means, used a rubidium atom held in place by optical tweezers. The team then used lasers and electromagnetic forces to control the atom’s quantum properties and scattered light in two directions. They also found that Bohr’s assertion held out.\n\n“Seeing quantum mechanics ‘in action’ at this fundamental level is simply breathtaking,” Chao-Yang Lu told New Scientist. “Bohr’s counterargument was brilliant. But the thought experiment remained theoretical for almost a century.”\n\nLu and his team hopes to use their experimental set-up to explore more, lesser-known aspects of the quantum realm, including the nature of the relationship between decoherence and entanglement.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "The Santa Cruz County Sheriff has confirmed that Erica Fox, the 55-year-old swimmer who went missing in the waters of Pacific Grove, CA, was killed by a shark.\n\nIn the latest update, authorities confirmed: “[the] Corner's Office has determined the cause of death to be sharp and blunt force injuries and submersion in water due to a shark attack. The manner of death has been ruled an accident.”\n\nThe species of shark responsible has not been disclosed. However, this exact spot has experienced shark attacks in the past, and great whites are known to roam the area.\n\nFox was swimming with a group she founded, the Kelp Krawlers, on December 21st, 2025, when she went missing from the others. There were reports of a large splash, and shark sightings. According to a responding member the U.S. Coast Guard:\n\n“The person who reported the shark sighting claimed they saw a shark breach the water with what appeared to be a human body in its mouth. They then witnessed the shark submerge below the waterline without resurfacing.\n\n“I can confirm that there was a reported sighting in the area, however we cannot necessarily correlate this sighting with the missing person as there is no confirming evidence of that.”\n\nFox’s body was later recovered on December 29th, 2025 in Santa Cruz County, south of Davenport Beach. According to her husband, Jean-Francois Vanreusel, she was identified by a Garmin watch and an electromagnetic shark deterrent still attached to her leg.\n\nAs mentioned, there were previous shark encounters and attacks at the very same spot. In May of 2022, another swimmer, Steve Breummer, was bitten by a great white shark at Lovers Point; he survived but sustained serious injuries. Then, in August of 2022, David Stickler was paddleboarding with his dog onboard at Lovers Point, when a shark chomped his board. He, and his dog, also survived.\n\nOur condolences go out to the family and friends of Erica Fox. Rest in peace.",

    "fullText": "As screen fatigue grows, a new trend is swapping smartphones for crosswords and sketchbooks – turning the humble bag into a tool for offline living\n\nThere’s a new “it” bag – but this time it is not about a designer label or splashy logo. Instead, it’s what is inside that counts.\n\nSo-called analogue bags, filled with activities such as crosswords, knitting, novels and journals, have become the unexpected accessory of the season.\n\nThey are being championed by millennials and gen Z as a way to reduce screen time. Similar to a prep bag, the idea is that the bag or basket should contain the essentials needed to remain offline for as long as possible. One user describes it as a “toy box for your attention span”.\n\nDavid Sax, the author of The Revenge of Analog, approves of the trend. “The idea that we can all just get into a lotus pose and fall into a state of meditative bliss is wildly unrealistic for the vast majority of us,” he says. “Our phones have everything you could ever ask for, so you need an alternative to hand in order to fill that void.”\n\nThe term was coined by Sierra Campbell, a 31-year-old content creator based in California. “My biggest fear is that I’ll lie on my deathbed and regret how much time I spent on phone,” she says in a TikTok video in which she first suggests the concept.\n\nThe idea has – somewhat paradoxically – become hugely popular on social media, with users posting videos talking through the contents of their analogue bags and sharing tips on what to fill them with. Some refer to them as their “stop scrolling” bags.\n\nThere are analogue wicker baskets for evenings on the sofa, bags for long journeys and even some for romantic weekends away. Suggestions include doing a joint wordsearch rather than playing Wordle individually.\n\nCampbell’s January analogue bag video – featuring a subscription to the New Yorker magazine, gel pens and a sketchbook – has been viewed more than 200,000 times in five days.\n\nThe trend forms part of a wider backlash against a culture of doomscrolling and the pressure to always be online. According to Ofcom, the UK telecoms regulator, the average adult in Great Britain checks their phone every 12 minutes. A 2022 survey by USwitch found that the average daily time among UK adults averaged five hours, in addition to screen-related work tasks.\n\nAnalogue bags sit alongside a resurgence in analogue technologies such as vinyl records, physical magazines and point-and-shoot cameras. Offline, in-person activities – including “cosy hobbies” such as pottery classes, crochet circles and even dinner parties – are also on the rise.\n\nCampbell says the catalyst for the analogue bag, which has reduced her screen time from seven hours a day to three, came from reading Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit. In the book, Duhigg outlines three components of a habit: cue, routine and reward.\n\nRather than trying to eliminate a bad habit, he argues that it is more effective to keep the cue and reward while changing the routine. For Campbell, this meant reaching for a bag of screen-free activities instead of her phone.\n\n“If you go to your phone for news, put a newspaper in your bag,” Campbell says. “If it’s for entertainment, try a good book. For creative inspiration, sketching tools or knitting. It’s just like physical fitness – whatever activity you’ll actually do is the best one to include.”\n\nRather than a brief digital detox, the analogue bag trend suggests people are attempting to change their relationship with screens for the long term.\n\nPete Etchells, a professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University and author of Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time, argues that rather than being addicted to our phones, we have simply formed habits around their use. He hopes the rise of analogue bags is “a shift in how people understand their relationship with technology”.\n\n“We do have agency and control over what we do with our time,” Etchells says. “And if you are not happy with how you use your phone and how you use social media, it’s great that people are starting to think about what the [options] look like – and how we can make access easier to those.”",

    "fullText": "Spokesperson says limiting access to paying subscribers just makes ability to generate unlawful images a premium service\n\nDowning Street has condemned the move by X to restrict its AI image creation tool to paying subscribers as insulting, saying it simply made the ability to generate explicit and unlawful images a premium service.\n\nThere has been widespread anger after the image tool for Grok, the AI element of X, was used to manipulate thousands of images of women and sometimes children to remove their clothing or put them in sexual positions.\n\nGrok announced in a post on X, which is owned by Elon Musk, that the ability to generate and edit images would be “limited to paying subscribers”. Those who pay have to provide personal details, meaning they could be identified if the function was misused.\n\nAsked about the change, a Downing Street spokesperson said it was unacceptable. “The move simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service,” they said.\n\n“It’s not a solution. In fact, it’s insulting to victims of misogyny and sexual violence. What it does prove is that X can move swiftly when it wants to do so. You heard the prime minister yesterday. He was abundantly clear that X needs to act, and needs to act now. It is time for X to grip this issue.\n\n“If another media company had billboards in town centres showing unlawful images, it would act immediately to take them down or face public backlash.”\n\nAsked if No 10 was going to take any further action, such as leaving X, the spokesperson said “all options are on the table”, and that it would support any action taken by Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator.\n\nSpeaking earlier on Friday, Anna Turley, the Labour party chair and a minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office, said there was no move as yet for the government to leave X, but individual ministers were considering doing so.\n\nShe told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s really, really important that we tackle this. Those conversations are ongoing across government. I think all of us in politics are evaluating our use of social media and how we do that, and I know that conversation is happening.”\n\nAsked if she would leave the site, Turley said: “I’ve thought about that a lot over the past few months.” Asked whether the Labour party would do so, she said: “Those conversations are taking place because it’s really important that we make sure that we’re in a safe space.”\n\nThe victim’s commissioner, Claire Waxman, said X was no longer a “safe space” for victims and her office was considering scaling back its presence on the site and focusing its communications on Instagram.\n\n“It makes the battle against violence against women and girls much harder when platforms such as X are enabling abuse on such an easy and regular basis,” Waxman said, adding that the platform was having a negative impact on its users’ mental health because of the proliferation of violence, abuse and race hate.\n\n“Why is that material not being taken down and those users being stopped?” she asked. “It is not safeguarding its users.” Waxman said she was concerned about Ofcom’s ability to police platforms such as X effectively. “Does Ofcom have the teeth to be able to really deal with these sorts of issues? That is a concern for me.”\n\nThere has been an exodus of women’s sector organisations from X. The domestic abuse charity Refuge left the site, as has Women’s Aid Ireland and Victim Support. Victim Support left in April, saying it was “no longer the right place for us to communicate with our audiences”. Women’s Aid Ireland said the decision was taken because of “increased levels of unchecked hate, misogyny, racism and anti-LGBTI+ content on the platform”.\n\nEmma Pickering, the head of technology at Refuge, said the decision by X to restrict access to the image tool for Grok to paying subscribers amounted to “the monetisation of abuse”.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "Robot vacuums that can climb stairs and device for BlackBerry lovers also on display at annual Las Vegas tech show\n\nThis year will be filled with robots that can fold your laundry, pick up objects and climb stairs, fridges that you can command to open by voice, laptops with screens that can follow you around the room on motorised hinges and the reimagining of the BlackBerry phone.\n\nThose are the predictions from the annual CES tech show in Las Vegas that took place this week. The sprawling event aims to showcase cutting-edge technology developed by startups and big brands.\n\nMany of these fancy developments will be available to actually buy, moving from outlandish concepts to production devices, although some are still limited to costly prototypes.\n\nThe rise of the humanoid robot continues, with the show floor filled with myriad prototypes, some of which operated autonomously rather than being remotely controlled or performing set routines this year.\n\nNot one but two different robots promised to do your laundry, make breakfast and serve drinks. In demos LG’s CLOiD home robot, which is reportedly due to undergo real-world testing next year, looked like a disembodied torso on a rolling platform, slowly and autonomously doing chores linked with various LG kitchen appliances.\n\nThe Chinese company Switchbot’s Onero H1, however, looks more like a security bot crossed with a robot vacuum with articulating arms ready to do chores. The company says it should go on sale later this year for an undisclosed sum. It joined impressive demos from many other Chinese robotics outfits, including Unitree, Booster Robotics and X-Humanoid, the recent winner of Beijing’s humanoid robot half-marathon.\n\nThis also promises to be that year that Boston Dynamics’ long-tested Atlas robot finally goes from awkward prototype to polished product, with a new design unveiled during the parent company Hyundai’s CES show.\n\nThe South Korean firm is partnering with Google’s DeepMind for robotic AI research and plans to deploy the Atlas robots, which are water resistant, can lift 50kg and automatically swap their batteries, to its manufacturing plants in the next couple of years.\n\nRobot vacuums are the more prevalent home robot for now, but even they have new tricks. Dreame’s Cyber10 Ultra arm-equipped robovac can lift up to 500g and use brushes and other nozzles while cleaning your floors. It will reportedly go on sale around August for about €1,800 (£1,560), although it was the company’s Cyber X concept with four legs and tank-like tracks that had attenders captivated because it might help it finally vanquish the mortal enemy of robot vacuums: climbing stairs.\n\nHowever, if actually cleaning the stairs is the goal, Roborock’s first two-wheel-leg robovac might be better. The Saros Rover is in development, shown off in prototype form, and can raise, lower and jump its way to each step, cleaning as it goes.\n\nNot even the humble fridge was safe this year from the march of robotics. Samsung debuted its new Family Hub fridge, which includes a screen on the front but its party piece is voice-controlled doors you can open and close hands-free.\n\nLess novel but potentially just as useful, GE built a barcode scanner into its new Profile fridge, which is designed to scan things as you discard them to automatically add them to a shopping list ready for when you need it. A camera inside the fridge lets you check remotely to see if anything’s finished or rotten.\n\nScores of new laptops were on show from all the major manufacturers including Acer, Dell, Samsung and others. But Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept was the start of the show: a regular-looking 16in laptop with a OLED screen that unrolls horizontally to a full-size 24in monitor for gaming and productivity on the go. Meanwhile, the company’s new ThinkPad Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist is going from concept to actual product with a motorised rotating hinge that automatically turns the screen to face you or your audience if you are presenting.\n\nSamsung used CES to show off its cutting-edge trifolding flexible screen Android phone-tablet hybrid, which takes the book-style folding design and adds another section that unfolds again like a pamphlet to reveal a large wide-screen tablet. Having gone on sale in South Korea just before the end of 2025 the Galaxy Z TriFold is expected to reach the US and other markets in the first half of this year for a big sum.\n\nBut for those who long for the days of physical keyboards on phones, the accessory company Clicks is bringing back the BlackBerry with its new Communicator: an Android phone with a physical keyboard. Designed as a “communication companion” with custom software that puts messaging above doomscrolling on social media, the Communicator can be used as a primary phone or as a partner to your existing iPhone or Android. It has a notification LED around the power button and a fingerprint scanner in the space bar. Reservations are open and the phone is due to ship later this year.\n\nClicks already sells keyboard cases for the iPhone, Pixel and other devices for those that don’t want to replace their phone completely with a BlackBerry. But it also had a new slide-out keyboard Bluetooth that doubles as a magnetic wireless charging battery pack on show at CES. The Power Keyboard magnetically sticks to the back of the phone and will be compatible with iPhones and Androids supporting Qi2, shipping in the spring.",

Employees cite time pressures, unclear expectations, limited training, and poor program visibility as reasons they do not participate. And while some groups benefit more than others—high-potential employees, for instance—this selective approach misses the wider opportunity. By creating a culture of mentorship across the organization, all employees—and the company itself—reap the rewards. To do this, organizations must first broaden access by adopting a mentoring-for-all approach, where everyone is assigned a mentor and mentee, unless they explicitly opt out.",

Legacy defenses, designed for rule-based software, cannot safeguard gen AI systems that learn and adapt from data. By combining survey data, executive interviews, and lab analysis, new research reveals systemic gaps: fragile supply chains, opaque vendor services, and an acute shortage of AI-security talent.

    "fullText": "Australians have been experiencing an uptick in a serious mosquito-borne virus, according to ABC.\n\nA case of Japanese encephalitis virus has been identified north-west of Melbourne. The virus was found in a mosquito trap installed in the western community of Horsham by monitoring personnel. This is the first case of the Australian summer, following an original outbreak of the virus in 2022.\n\nThe Japanese encephalitis virus is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fever, vomiting, and seizures. Once in roughly every 250 cases, the virus causes severe inflammation of the brain, which can be fatal. Luckily, most people who contract it experience either mild symptoms or no symptoms whatsoever.\n\nAustralian researchers have previously identified pig farms as major vectors for the Japanese encephalitis virus.\n\nThanks to increased global heat and precipitation due to atmospheric pollution, mosquito populations have been spiking. Along with them have been the viruses they carry. This includes Zika, dengue, and West Nile virus.\n\nResearchers have been busy trying to find new ways to manage explosions of mosquito populations. Some have found that soap can immobilize them without resorting to indiscriminate insecticides. Others have found promising results in a new kind of fungus.\n\nAttacking the root of the issue will require lowering pollution in major sectors such as agriculture, electricity, and transportation. This can stabilize weather patterns and slow the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes.\n\nWhile up-to-date vaccines are the best front-line defence, Australian authorities suggested a range of precautions to avoid Japanese encephalitis virus infections. These included the use of bug spray, covering up with light-colored clothing, and dismantling stagnant water pools around the home.\n\n\"Anyone can be bitten by mosquitoes, but people living, working or spending time outdoors in northern Victoria — especially near rivers — may be at higher risk,\" said Victoria's chief health officer Caroline McElnay, per ABC.\n\nHow bad are the mosquitoes in your area?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

The GameCube library is now available as part of the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.\n\nThe supported games feature a higher resolution than the original releases, and players can customize the controls as well. There is also a wireless controller designed after the original GameCube controller that offers a C button, and can also be used for non-GameCube games. There's a fun GameCube Easter egg when you start up the app that will be of interest to original GameCube owners.\n\nThese GameCube games are only available to play for subscribers to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack tier. You can purchase that for $80 per year.\n\nLet's take a look at all of the games confirmed for Switch Online, including both those that are available now and those coming at some point in the future. As with Nintendo Switch Online’s other classic libraries, games will be added periodically and are subject to change.\n\nInitially released in 2002, Wind Waker's cartoonish style and gameplay won over fans and spawned sequels and spin-offs with 3DS titles like Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks.\n\nThe 2003 racing video game was a collaboration between Nintendo and Sega. It's the successor to F-Zero X, and continued the series' difficult, high-speed racing style, while keeping the basic gameplay and control system from the Nintendo 64 game.\n\nGX introduced a \"story mode\" element, a series first, where the player assumes the role of F-Zero pilot Captain Falcon through nine chapters while completing various missions. Players will be able to join three other friends in four-person races online or locally.\n\nSoulcalibur II is considered to be one of the greatest fighting games ever made. It had improved graphics compared to its predecessor and introduced several new and guest characters, including Link (with four costumes) for the GameCube version.\n\nFor some soccer fun, you can look forward to Super Mario Strikers on the Switch 2. First released for the GameCube in 2005--and the last Mario game published for that system--the game featured the plumber and his pals in five-a-side soccer matches.\n\nEach game could also become very unpredictable thanks to the power-ups on the field, making for some very exciting matches as the momentum shifted between teams. Two sequels would be developed over the years, starting with 2007's Mario Strikers Charged on the Wii and Mario Strikers Battle League for the Switch in 2022.\n\nChibi-Robo follows a series of tiny robots, who are programmed to spread happiness. The game has the player cleaning Chibi-Robo's nearby environment, trying to collect \"Happy Points.\" All the while, making sure your battery doesn't die.\n\nThe original game was released in 2005, with a sequel for the Nintendo 3DS entitled Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder. The original Chibi-Robo had a Japanese re-release in 2009 for the Wii and the final entry for the series, Chibi-Robo: Zip Lash, also for the 3DS released back in 2015.\n\nTaking Mario on vacation to the tropical Isle Delfino, where he, Toadsworth, Princess Peach, and five Toads are trying to soak up some sun. Too bad a villain known as Shadow Mario is vandalizing the island with graffiti, with Mario getting wrongfully convicted for the mess.\n\nAs punishment, Mario is ordered to clean up Isle Delfino, using a device called the Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device (F.L.U.D.D.), all the while saving Princess Peach from Shadow Mario. The game was re-released alongside Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy in the Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection on Nintendo Switch in September 2020.\n\nFire Emblem: Path of Radiance is the ninth main installment in the Fire Emblem series, but the third to be released in the West in 2005. A direct sequel for the Wii, Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, was released in 2007 in North America and Japan, and later in 2008 for Europe and Australia.\n\nIt was a rare example of cross-platform play, as players with save data from the Game Boy Advance Fire Emblem games were able to connect with Path of Radiance and access concept art and special maps revolving around characters from those games.\n\nWario's wonderfully weird 2003 game is now available to play. If you never jumped into the garlic-fueled oddity when it was first released, then you missed out on a fun adventure featuring Mario's bizarro counterpart as he faced off against a mysterious black jewel that had stolen his castle and loot.\n\nMario's little brother's first solo outing broke away from the mold, and for the first time, a Nintendo console launched with a Luigi-centric title. Luigi's Mansion put the green-hat hero in the spotlight as he busted ghosts and solved puzzles to rescue his brother and friends.\n\nThe game was re-released for the 3DS and had two sequels, the latest being a Nintendo Switch launch title back in 2019.\n\nPokemon XD was the successor to the GameCube title Pokemon Colosseum and also takes place in Orre, the setting of Colosseum's adventure mode.\n\nThe game was first announced in March 2005 as a new GameCube game, but not as a sequel to Colosseum--later developments, as well as two promotional demo versions, confirmed the game would be very similar. Shadow Pokemon, first introduced in Colosseum, were a major gameplay element, with a Shadow Lugia being featured on the game's box art.\n\nWhile most of the gameplay recycled a lot of material from Colosseum, Pokemon XD became a fan favorite.\n\nThe GameCube Online library will also feature Pokemon XD's predecessor, Pokemon Colosseum. The game featured creature models ported from both Pokemon Stadium games. Pokemon Colosseum was a critical and commercial success, with lots of praise for its graphics and music.",

    "description": "The U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue its next rulings on January 14 as several major cases remain pending including the legality ​of President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs.\n\nThe court indicated on its website on Friday that ‌it could release decisions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting next Wednesday. The court ‌does not announce in advance what cases will be decided.\n\nThe justices issued one ruling on Friday in a criminal case.\n\nThe challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to ⁠office in January 2025. The outcome ‌will also impact the global economy.\n\nDuring arguments in the case heard by the court on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the ‍legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower courts that he overstepped his authority.\n\nTrump has said tariffs have made the United ​States stronger financially. In a social media post on January 2, Trump said a Supreme Court ‌ruling against the tariffs would be a \"terrible blow\" to the United States.\n\nTrump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods imported from individual countries - nearly every foreign trading partner - to address what he called a national emergency related to U.S. trade deficits. He invoked the same law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl ⁠and illicit drugs into the United States as a national ​emergency.\n\nThe challenges to the tariffs in the cases before the ​Supreme Court were brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 U.S. states, most of them Democratic-governed.\n\nOther important cases are also awaiting rulings at the court, which ‍has a 6-3 conservative majority, ⁠including a challenge to a key section of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 federal law enacted by Congress to prevent racial discrimination in voting.\n\nAnother involves a challenge on free ⁠speech grounds to a Colorado law banning psychotherapists from conducting \"conversion therapy\" that aims to change an LGBT minor's sexual orientation ‌or gender identity.",

    "fullText": "Managing money can be challenging, but it can be even more so as a couple — especially if the two people involved don’t trust each other with money.\n\nThat’s the case for a couple featured on a recent episode of Ramit Sethi’s podcast, I Will Teach You To Be Rich. Jamie, 45, and her husband Ryan, 35, have been married 10 years and have three kids. They live in the Midwest, make about $245,000 per year and have a net worth of $1,033,000 (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nStill, they feel like they’re struggling financially and tend to run out of money at the end of the month, with no idea where it went.\n\nA major stumbling block? Jamie has lost trust in Ryan after he made a series of major financial decisions without her. The largest of these occurred two years ago when Ryan, unhappy with his lucrative finance job, took what Sethi referred to as the “nuclear of nuclear options.”\n\nRyan abruptly quit his job and cashed out the 401(k) tied to it without consulting Jamie beforehand or telling her immediately afterward. He compounded this by quitting his next job without first informing her and then borrowing from his IRA to fund a classic car purchase.\n\nRyan says he “just hit a breaking point.” But now Jamie has a savings account she keeps separate from Ryan to protect their money. She’s resentful that she’s had to pay down his credit card debt, and the couple’s money talks often end in ”arguing, divorce threats and nothing ever changing,” Jamie told Sethi.\n\nThe couple wants to get their finances in order — and stop arguing — but to do so, Sethi says they’ll need to stop thinking of each other as individuals, adopt a shared vision and work as a team.\n\nJamie and Ryan’s situation demonstrates the effects that emotions, burnout and trust can play in derailing the financial plans of even those who are relatively well off. The couple didn’t explicitly state whether Ryan was suffering burnout at work, but he does display some of the behaviors of those who are affected by burnout.\n\nBurnout or depression can lead to impulsive decisions, such as Ryan abruptly quitting his job and making several impulse purchases. It can also cause people to run up their credit cards, which Ryan was doing, and defer making responsible financial decisions, which he was also doing by offloading these responsibilities to Jamie.",

    "description": "The hosts of \"The View\" got into an old-fashioned yelling match on Friday, with Joy Behar having to remind them \"we're on television\"",
    "fullText": "“The View” doesn’t see as many on-air clashes as it used to, but on Friday, the ABC hosts got into an old-fashioned yelling match over Greenland and Venezuela. Eventually, moderator Joy Behar had to remind host Ana Navarro “we’re on television!”\n\nThe argument came in the very first Hot Topic of the day, as the women discussed Republican outrage over Trump’s renewed attempt to buy Greenland. Host Sunny Hostin wondered why these lawmakers are staunchly against purchasing Greenland but were fine with the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. She quickly noted that Greenland is not for sale, and drew parallels between the two situations.\n\n“Neither is Venezuela, and nor is its oil ours,” Hostin said. “Yet, we went in, we took the president — I’ve called it a kidnapping, because I believe that’s what it is — and we take the head of state of Venezuela, and take the oil, and is, I think, going to put the money in offshore accounts. So how is that OK but Greenland isn’t?”\n\nLAWMAKERS DENOUNCE TRUMP THREATS TO SEIZE GREENLAND: After GOP Sen. Thom Tillis lashed out at White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller’s claim about expanding America’s borders, 'The View' co-hosts weigh in. pic.twitter.com/hdTunC1HJl\n\n— The View (@TheView) January 9, 2026\n\nAt that, Ana Navarro cut in, assuring Hostin she loves her, but immediately pushing back and saying that an equivalency cannot be made between Greenland and Venezuela.\n\n“Let’s look at some facts. Venezuela is a dictatorship, Greenland is not,” Navarro said. “Denmark is our ally, Greenland is our ally, we have military bases and operations in Greenland, Denmark is part of NATO, as we are, so we are part of one big alliance. Venezuela is a place where they kill, jail, and torture the opposition, where they repress human rights.”\n\nNavarro argued that “we lose the point” if Greenland and Venezuela are treated as the same, which lit the fire for Hostin.\n\n“No we don’t! The law is the law,” Hostin retorted. “It is an unlawful thing that we did in Venezuela, and it would be unlawful for us to do it in Greenland.”\n\nNavarro then reiterated her feelings from earlier in the week, saying that the methods used can and should be questioned, but she’s still celebrating along with Venezuelans. She also added that she doesn’t consider the operation in Venezuela successful “until every single political prisoner is released, and there’s free and fair elections.”\n\nHostin then pressed her on whether Navarro thinks it’s OK for the U.S. to take Venezuela’s oil, prompting Navarro to snap back that “Venezuelans think it’s OK because Maduro stole it!”\n\nFrom there, the women argued over the legality of the move and whether the legality even matters, talking over each other and refusing to let anyone else weigh in — namely host Alyssa Farah Griffin, who kept trying. Eventually, Behar had to raise her voice.\n\n“Hold on! Ana, we’re on television!” she bellowed.\n\n“I’m eight months pregnant, can we just all have a chance to speak? Like, what are we doing?” Farah Griffin agreed.\n\nThe conversation got back on track and more audible from there, and though they still disagreed, the women were able to finish out the segment.\n\nYou can watch the full argument in the video above.\n\nThe post ‘The View’ Erupts Into Yelling Match Over Greenland and Venezuela: ‘Ana, We’re on Television!’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "These movies have hocus AND pocus.",
    "fullText": "What if a team of super magicians used their talent and training to stage elaborate heists? That’s the high concept that drives the Now You See Me franchise. Critics were lukewarm when Now You See Me was released in 2013, categorizing the film as a heist flick with thin characters and a plot that fell apart as often as it twisted, but Now You See Me pulled off its own escape act—audiences loved the movie's flashy style, whipsaw pace, and all-star cast featuring names like Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, and Morgan Freeman. The result was box office magic: a movie with a $75M budget that returned over $300M worldwide. Now You See Me has since grown into an internationally successful, long-term franchise for distributor Lionsgate: The third installment was released on Nov. 14, and a fourth Now You See Me film is already in development.\n\nLike any long-running franchises, the Now You See Me-verse can be confusing, so we put together 10 infographics to pull back the curtain on Now You See Me's magic. First, a quick recap of each movie:\n\nNow You See Me (2013): The initial entry in the series introduces us to the thieves/illusionists known as the “Four Horsemen.” These best-in-the-business magicians are recruited by a mysterious secret society called The Eye to pull off large-scale heists in front of live audiences, then distribute the money to the needy.\n\nNow You See Me 2 (2016): The sequel expands the world of the first film, with bigger heists, deeper secrets, and funnier jokes. Having gone into hiding at the end of Now You See Me, The Horsemen resurface a year later and are coerced into a global heist by a tech mogul trying to steal all the privacy in the world.\n\nNow You See Me: Now You Don't (2025): Set a decade after the last film, Now You See Me: Now You Don't features all five Horsemen teaming up with three cocky young criminals/illusionists to pull off their most audacious caper yet: the theft of the world's most valuable diamond.\n\nThe Now You See Me movies present stage magic in a semi-realistic (though highly stylized) way. To nail the realism, the films draw inspiration from some of the greatest magicians in history, including:\n\nDavid Copperfield: The Horsemen’s larger-than-life illusions/heists like stealing the contents of a bank vault while performing a Vegas show seem inspired by the feats of magician David Copperfield, whose magical feats include flying over the Grand Canyon and vanishing the Statue of Liberty.\n\nDavid Blaine: Street magician David Blaine’s shadow is all over the Now You See Me Movies. Without the popularity of Blaine’s modern, gritty take on magic, the Now You See Me movies would likely not exist.\n\nHarry Houdini: Anything about stage magic is ultimately inspired by Houdini, the greatest magician of all time. Houdini's daring escape tricks inspired the series’ inciting incident, the death of magician Lionel Shrike, as well as the opening set piece where Henley Reeves escapes a water tank.\n\nAndrei Jikh: Jikh’s cardistry skills are evident in all the Horsemen, particularly in Jack Wilder. Jikh served as a consultant on Now You See Me.\n\nKeith Barry: Another Now You See Me magic consultant, Irish mentalist Keith Barry pioneered and popularized many of the hypnosis and mentalism feats used by character Merritt McKinney.\n\nThe Horsemen are known as much for their larceny as their skills at illusion. Below are their most memorable heists, hold-ups, schemes, and burglaries.\n\nIn the caper that introduces us to the Horsemen, the magicians rob a bank in Paris while performing before a crowd in Vegas. They choose a seemingly random person from the crowd and tell him he’s going to rob his own bank, the Crédit Républicain de Paris. Then they appear to teleport him to France, where he breaks into a bank vault, hits a button on a vacuum machine, and the money is seemingly sucked from Paris to Vegas where it rains down on the audience.\n\nAt a show in New Orleans, the Horsemen introduce their benefactor, insurance magnate Arthur Tressler, then proceed to drain his personal bank account while they’re onstage, depositing the money in the accounts of audience members, who all turn out to be victims of Hurricane Katrina that Tressler’s insurance company stiffed on repayments.\n\nIn Now You See Me 2, The Horsemen are coerced by evil tech magnate Walter Mabry to steal a cutting-edge computer chip that can decrypt and expose every system in the world. Housed in a highly secure research facility in Macau, China, the chip is conveniently the size of a playing card, allowing the Horsemen to use cardistry and sleight-of-hand skills to remove it from the building while being searched by guards.\n\nIn Now You See Me Now You Don't, the Château de Roussillon is an ultimate magician's playground. The Eye's headquarters in a mansion in the French countryside is decked out with mind-bending large-scale illusions like rotating rooms and halls of mirrors. The Château de Roussillon is a real castle, but the filmmakers used Nádasdy Castle for the exterior shots in the movie. A main inspiration for the building is a real place: Los Angeles' Magic Castle.\n\nOpened in 1963, the Magic Castle is a restaurant/club/clubhouse for magicians housed in a stately Victorian mansion overlooking Hollywood. Not only is The Magic Castle credited as magic consultants on Now You See Me: Now You Don't, much of the cast trained at the Castle to prepare for their roles.\n\nIf you'd like to visit, it won't be easy: The Magic Castle is an invitation-only private club, so you have to be a member of the Academy of Magical Arts or be invited by a member. But if you aren't friends with a magician, you can book a night at the nearby Magic Castle Hotel, where a stay comes with an invitation to the Castle.\n\nI analyzed the tricks in the movies with professional magician Dave Cox, and as over the top as the Horsemen's heists are, all but two of the many magic tricks presented in the Now You See Me movies could technically be done in real life—but the word “technically” is doing a lot of work here. The tricks are possible within the context of a stylized blockbuster, but would be extremely unlikely to work as well in real life: an extended, impromptu cardistry routine involving four magicians passing a playing card between themselves while security guards thoroughly search them makes for exciting cinema, but almost definitely wouldn’t go that smoothly in reality.\n\nBut, here is how three of the most iconic tricks from the franchise could be done in real life.\n\nNow You See Me opens with a unique piece of cinematic trickery. Street magician J. Daniel Atlas is performing for a crowd on a city street. He riffles quickly through a deck of cards and asks a spectator to “see one card.” When his subject has a card in mind, a nearby building is lit up revealing a giant seven of diamonds, the card the subject was thinking of.\n\nIt’s amazing if you’re “playing along at home,” because the chances are very good that you chose the seven of diamonds too. The trick is done in real life the same way it’s done in the movies: The magician uses sleight of hand or a gimmicked deck to pause on the desired card imperceptibly longer than the other cards. The director of Now You See Me added a frame or two to “pause” on the seven of diamonds, making it more likely that you think of that card.\n\nWhile it’s probably not possible to throw a card as accurately or forcefully as the characters in Now You See Me, you can throw playing cards really fast with the right technique and a lot of practice.\n\nHenley Reeves’ introduction is a trick where she escapes from a water tank filled with piranhas, a variation of the kind of classic escape artist illusions popularized by Houdini. Water escapes are dangerous, but not as dangerous as they might seem because they’re rigged—no sane person is really going to try to escape from handcuffs and chains while underwater.\n\nA group of thieves publicly “performing” large-scale robberies is strictly Hollywood, but the three real-life crimes below share some of the showmanship and audacity of the Horsemen’s heists:\n\nLouvre heist (2025): A recent jewelry-jacking at the Louvre involved a highly professional and brazen plan executed in broad daylight. The thieves used a truck-mounted mechanical lift to break into a second-floor balcony window and were in and out in less than eight minutes. The robbers have all been caught, but won't say where the jewels are.\n\nStockholm helicopter robbery (2009): This thrilling heist involved a gang using a stolen police helicopter to land on the roof of a G4S cash management service building in the Stockholm suburb of Västberga. The brazen thieves smashed through a skylight, lowered themselves into the building, and stole millions while police were stymied by fake bombs placed near the police helicopter. Seven men were sentenced to prison, but authorities suspect as many as ten more people may have gotten away with the crime, and the 39 million Swedish krona loot was never recovered.\n\nIsabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist (1990): This heist involved two men who disguised themselves as Boston police officers to gain entry into the museum just before it opened. The pair convinced one security guard to let them in, then handcuffed the rest of the guards and stole 13 priceless works of art valued at over $500 million. Despite a $10 million dollar reward, the art has never been recovered and no one has been charged with the crime.\n\nIf you’ve watched all three NYSM movies and you’re still craving magical entertainment, check out these seven, all-killer no-filler movies about magic and magicians:\n\nThe Prestige (2006): The Prestige is set in the late 19th century, before you could just google how any magic trick was done. Back then, the secret of sawing a lady in half was closely guarded, and The Prestige’s rival magicians–played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale–will go to any length to keep the hidden knowledge of their craft.\n\nThe Illusionist (2010): This animated, silent feature provides a complete contrast to the Now You See Me movies. There’s no glitz or flash, just a quietly devastating character study of a magician’s relationship with the last person in his world who still believes in magic. Adapted from a screenplay by French cinema legend Jacques Tati, The Illusionist tells its intimate story through the evocative animation of Sylvain Chomet. It will definitely make you cry.\n\nThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013): The Now You See Me movies go to great lengths to deny it, but magic is cheesy and magicians are weirdoes. Burt Wonderstone leans into the goofiness by casting Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi as Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelson, past-their-prime Vegas magicians bedeviled by Jim Carrey's Steve Gray, a Criss Angel-esque magic man who’s a different flavor of cheesy.\n\nThe Magician (1958): Max von Sydow plays the title character in The Magician, where everything is shot in black-and-white and no one gets away with a bunch of money or engages in any witty banter.\n\nThe Illusionist (2006): Yes, I’m recommending two movies with the same title. 2006’s The Illusionist is a moody, slow-burn mystery/romance that’s tonally a world away from Now You See Me’s glitz, but both films share a love of clever misdirection, intricate magic, “woah” reveals, and head-spinning plot twists. If you like the “magic as a means of social justice” theme of NYSM, you’ll like The Illusionist.\n\nThe Sorcerer’s Apprentice (2010): The Sorcerer’s Apprentice stars Nicolas Cage, who brings his own magic to every role, as a bonafide sorcerer who lives in modern New York City and fights a lonely war against dark magic on behalf of all mankind. Jay Baruchel plays his apprentice, and the pair use magical spells to battle a rival sorcerer.\n\nSleight (2016): This scrappy, low-budget flick provides a very different vision of an illusionist turning to crime. Jacob Latimore plays a young street magician who’s left to care for his sister after their parents die. Magic isn’t paying the bills, so he turns to drug dealing, and must use his skills at deception and sleight-of-hand to stay alive.",

The first, named \"Chat GPT for Chrome with GPT-5, Claude Sonnet & DeepSeek AI,\" has a Featured badge and 2.7K ratings with over 600,000 users. \"AI Sidebar with Deepseek, ChatGPT, Claude and more\" appears verified and has 2.2K ratings with 300,000 users.\n\nHowever, these add-ons are actually sending AI chatbot conversations and browsing data directly to threat actors' servers. This means that hackers have access to plenty of sensitive information that users share with ChatGPT and DeepSeek as well as URLs from Chrome tabs, search queries, session tokens, user IDs, and authentication data. Any of this can be used to conduct identity theft, phishing campaigns, and even corporate espionage.\n\nResearchers found that the extensions impersonate legitimate Chrome add-ons developed by AITOPIA that add a sidebar to any website with the ability to chat with popular LLMs. The malicious capabilities stem from a request for consent for “anonymous, non-identifiable analytics data.\" Threat actors are using Lovable, a web development platform, to host privacy policies and infrastructure, obscuring their processes.\n\nResearchers also found that if you uninstalled one of the extensions, the other would open in a new tab in an attempt to trick users into installing that one instead.\n\nIf you've added AI-related extensions to Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/ and look for the malicious impersonators. Hit Remove if you find them. As of this writing, the extensions identified by Ox no longer appear in the Chrome Web Store.\n\nAs I've written about before, malicious extensions occasionally evade detection and gain approval from browser libraries by posing as legitimate add-ons, even earning \"Featured\" and \"Verified\" tags. Some threat actors playing the long game will convert extensions to malware several years after launch. This means you can't blindly trust ratings and reviews, even if they've been accrued over time.\n\nTo minimize risk, you should always vet browser extensions carefully (even those that appear legit) for obvious red flags, like misspellings in the description and a large number of positive reviews accumulated in a short time. Head to Google or Reddit to see if anyone has identified the add-on as malicious or found any issues with the developer or source. Make sure you're downloading the right extension—threat actors often try to confuse users with names that appear similar to popular add-ons.\n\nFinally, you should regularly audit your extensions and remove those that aren't essential. Go to chrome://extensions/ to see everything you have installed.",

    "title": "Why Tech Launches Stopped Feeling Magical",
    "description": "People used to camp out to buy new phones. Wild!",
    "fullText": "You can pinpoint the exact minute of the high-water mark for tech-based enthusiasm: January 9, 2007, 9:41 AM PST, the moment Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone to the world.\n\nCell phones weren’t new—neither were cellphones with touch screens—but this one was different: so high-tech it seemed like it couldn’t be real, but so perfectly designed, it felt inevitable. And people were hyped. Not just tech nerds: normal people. The crowd at the 2007 Macworld Conference & Expo broke into rapturous applause when Jobs showed off the iPhone’s multi-touch—an ovation for a software feature!—because it seemed like Jobs was touching a better future.\n\nThe iPhone, people said, was like something out of Star Trek. But unlike communicators or tri-corders, it was obtainable (if you had $500) evidence of a future where technology would finally free us from the drudgery of our lives so we could boldly go—wherever, it doesn't matter.\n\nSteve Jobs mentioned Star Trek as an inspiration for the iPhone all the time; apparently the show is quite popular among tech people. Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek, and thus was the spiritual father of the iPhone. He spent the 1960s lounging poolside in Los Angeles, dreaming of a post-scarcity tomorrow where the wise, brave men of The Federation kept the Romulans at bay and there were hot alien chicks on every Class-M planet. At the same time, the future’s real prophet, Philip K. Dick, was huddled in a dank Oakland apartment, a stone’s throw from Silicon Valley, popping amphetamines like breath mints and feverishly typing dystopian visions of corporate surveillance states and nightmare techno-realities into his Hermes Rocket typewriter.\n\nRoddenberry's Federation promised technology would help humanity evolve beyond its baser instincts. Dick saw technology amplifying our worst impulses.\n\nSo what happened? How did we go from a Roddenberry future where each new product release seemed like another step closer to collective utopia to our Dick-esque present, where the first question we ask of any new technology is “How is this going to hurt me?\"\n\nVisionary heads of start-ups like to blather about \"paradigm shifts\" and \"world-changing technology\" but people don’t get excited for tech products that are going to, say, cure cancer. Most of life (for pampered Westerners, anyway) is dealing with routine annoyances, and tech promises a way out. Remember printing MapQuest directions before leaving the house? It was a pain in the ass. People were excited for the iPhone because it solved the MapQuest problem and so many other small, intimate problems, like “I can't instantly send a photo to my friend” or “I get bored while I’m riding the bus.” Products that do this flourish, and ones that fail are discarded like a Juicero.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how great the iPhone was back in 2007 in terms of solving annoyances. Buying one meant you no longer had to carry a notepad, camera, laptop, MP3 player, GPS device, flashlight, or alarm clock. It was all crammed into a single black mirror. But speaking of black mirror ...\n\n\"We’re in an era of incremental updates, not industry-defining breakthroughs,\" says Heather Sliwinski, founder of tech public relations firm Changemaker Communications. \"Today's new iPhone offers a slightly better camera, marginally different dimensions or AI features that no one is asking for. Those aren't updates that go viral or justify consumers shelling out thousands of dollars for a device that's only slightly better than what they already own.\"\n\nIn economics, \"marginal utility\" is the additional satisfaction or benefit a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good or service. The marginal utility leap between a flip phone and the first iPhone was huge. But economics teaches us that marginal utility diminishes with each additional unit consumed. Each new iPhone release provided progressively less additional satisfaction compared to what users already had. Slightly faster chips, slightly better cameras, USB-C instead of Lightning, titanium instead of aluminum—who cares?\n\nIf we were merely bored with tech products, it would be one thing. But increasingly, devices that were desired because we want to make our lives easier or more enjoyable are making them harder and worse.\n\n“When you buy a new tech product today, you're not just buying one physical product. You're committing to downloading another app, creating another account and managing another subscription,\" Sliwinski says. \"Consumers are exhausted by the endless management that comes with each new device.\"\n\nIn economics, you’d call that “diseconomies of scale”: what happens when a business becomes so large its bureaucracy costs outweigh efficiency gains. In personal terms, it’s when the time and energy it takes to sync, charge, and coordinate your “time-saving” device makes you the middle manager of your own life.\n\nThen there’s the kipple. In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Philip K. Dick defines “kipple” as useless objects that accumulate: ”junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers or yesterday's homeopape.” That drawer full of orphaned power cords and connectors, your broken earbuds, the extra game controllers, the Roku, Chomecast, and old Fitbit are physical kipple, but the virtual kipple is worse. “Personally, I have at least four different apps that I need to download and manage just to live in my apartment complex—smart lock system, community laundry, rent payments, maintenance requests,” Sliwinski says.\n\nAccording to Dick, kipple doesn't just accumulate; it metastasizes, growing constantly until the Star Trek lifestyle you envisioned becomes a Dick-esque swamp of dependencies, and The future goes from being a place you want to live to somewhere you’re trapped.\n\nThe door refused to open. It said, “Five cents, please.”He searched his pockets. No more coins; nothing. “I’ll pay you tomorrow,” he told the door. ― Philip K. Dick, Ubik\n\n\"Corporations have spent years trying to manufacture excitement around relatively low-importance features instead of genuinely useful developments, and consumers have learned to recognize that pattern,\" says Kaveh Vahdat, founder of RiseOpp, a Fractional CMO and SEO firm based in San Francisco.\n\nNowhere does this consumer indifference seem greater than with AI. \"Consumers are testing Sora or testing Grok and all of that, but there’s really not been a single use case or product for AI that I think consumers are excited about,\" says Sliwinski.\n\nThis will not stop tech companies. Even without excitement, artificial intelligence is everywhere in tech, from toothbrushes to baby strollers (I think PKD would have found the AI stroller darkly funny: it's self-driving, but it won't work if you put a baby in it.) \"There’s a lot of buzz around AI but we’re missing the 'so what?'\"\n\nBeyond \"so what?\" consumers have started asking \"How will this hurt me?\" \"Is AI going to encourage my child to take their own life? Is it going to steal my job? Is it destroying everything pure about humanity?\"\n\nTech companies don't seem like they're scaling back on AI or doing an effective job of explaining its benefits, and if the recent past is an indicator, if they can't make our lives easier, they'll try to imprison us instead, employing psychologists, neuroscientists, and \"growth hackers\" specifically to make products harder to put down. The innovation isn't in new products that make life easier, but in encouraging addiction through variable reward schedules, social validation metrics, parasocial relationships, and other dark arts until eventually we end up like the half-lifers in Ubik, husks in cryopods, living in a manufactured reality where we still have to pay for the doors to open. That's the PKD take, anyway.\n\n\"Maybe 10 to 20 years down the road we will have another huge step change like the iPhone that can condense all these different devices that we’re using or apps that we’re using —but the tech isn’t there yet,\" Sliwinski says.\n\nIn Star Trek, humanity doesn’t abandon scarcity. Technology eventually makes scarcity indefensible, and that's only possible after a planet-wide war. From that Roddenberry-esque perspective, enshittification is what happens when old economic systems try to survive in a world where technology keeps eroding their justification, and each tiny \"I don't care\" iteration to tech products is a small step closer to Star Trek's promised land of holodecks, abundance, and hot aliens.",

    "description": "PowerToys really should come pre-installed for every Windows 11 user.",
    "fullText": "I'm someone who routinely switches between Mac and Windows. It's a hazard of being a tech writer. But the thing is, I'm so used to the user friendliness in macOS that whenever I shift to Windows mode, there are some hiccups. Windows tends to throw up walls where there really shouldn't be any. I used to just white-knuckle through it, but that was before I fully embraced PowerToys.\n\nPowerToys is a collection of utilities made by Microsoft itself. It's free to download on GitHub, or a myriad of other places, and unlike with Windows 11, Microsoft actually adds useful and interesting features to it every couple of weeks. You can download and install PowerToys from the GitHub page, the Microsoft Store, or using Windows Package Manager.\n\nHere are a few of PowerToys utilities that have become a must for me (after installing the app, you really should browse all that it offers to see what strikes your fancy). If you took them away, I wouldn't be sure how to use my Windows PC anymore—this thing should really come pre-installed.\n\nThese days, Windows Search can come across a little heavy and bloated, just like the Start menu. While it’s fine for opening apps once in a while, I can’t really use it for anything more than that. Plus, I’m a macOS user, so I’m used to Spotlight Search’s lightning-fast keyboard launcher. While you can use third-party keyboard launchers on Windows now (Raycast being the latest addition), my favorite option is actually Microsoft’s own keyboard launcher, the Command Palette that’s included in PowerToys.\n\nLike Spotlight Search, it’s light and fast, and you can assign any shortcut to it. I use it to quickly launch apps, search for files, and even search for open windows. Command Palette even has a really helpful Bookmarks feature that I use a lot. I’ve created bookmarks for quickly opening frequently used folders like Downloads and Screenshots, and even websites. A Bookmark can be triggered by searching for a keyword, or through its own dedicated keyboard shortcut (I’ve set one up for my Downloads folder, which is really handy). For more, I’ve got a detailed guide on setting up Command Palette that you should check out.\n\nIt's mind-boggling that Windows 11 still does not have an automatic dark mode. Over the years, Windows 11's dark theme has slowly expanded to cover all the apps you care about. But there's no easy way to toggle it on, and there's no way to automatically turn it on in evening, or on a schedule.\n\nSo, of course, there's a PowerToys utility for that. The recently added Light Switch utility lets you create a global custom keyboard shortcut for turning on the dark theme. For the Schedule section in the Light Switch utility, you can set up an automated schedule based on fixed hours, or using the local sunset time, which is how I use it.\n\nI shuffle between macOS and Windows 11 all the time, and there are some creature comforts in macOS that I now have a hard time living without. One of them is the ability to quickly preview any file in Finder by pressing the Space button. There is no such option in Windows, and until now, you needed a third-party app to enable it, which wasn't always reliable. Now, Microsoft has included a similar feature in PowerToys' Peek utility. Once enabled, you can press the Space bar after selecting any file to preview it. You can then use the arrow keys to navigate to other files in the folder as well. Press Enter to open the file in the default app.\n\nWindows has a built-in OCR (or text extractor) feature for images that can be accessed via the Snipping Tool. But it's really slow. When I'm in a pinch and I need to copy text from an image, I prefer to use the Text Extractor utility in PowerToys instead. It's much faster. Use the dedicated shortcut Windows + Shift + T to see an overlay on the screen. Use the mouse to highlight the area that you want to transcribe. Once you let go of the cursor, the text will be saved to your clipboard automatically.\n\nThis is one of those PowerToys utilities that really should be a default Windows 11 feature by now. Resizing an image, or a batch of them, is something that I need to do often, as someone who writes online for a living. But you might need it too, from time to time, to compress or resize images for an online upload, or a presentation. Instead of opening a heavy image editing program and manually resizing images one by one, use this plugin instead.\n\nOnce enabled, it will show up in the right-click menu in File Explorer. Select one or multiple images, click Resize with Image Resizer, choose one of the size presets (you can add more presets from the PowerToys app) or create a custom resolution, click the Resize button, and that's it.\n\nI can't imagine using Windows without PowerToys' Awake utility. It adds a handy little tray icon that I can click to keep my PC awake longer than the default sleep settings would allow for. I have a custom-built PC with a big honking power supply, so I take my auto-sleep settings quite seriously. But there are times when I'm downloading a large file in the background, or I have a long AI task running, when I want the PC to stay on. That's where the Awake utility really helps. You can choose to keep your PC awake indefinitely, or for 30 minutes, 1 hour, or any custom duration.\n\nThe built-in window management in Windows is quite impressive in its own right, but it falls short for my workflow. I usually like working with my text editor, a browser, and Slack open at all times. Because I have a large monitor, I have my writing app and Slack on one side and a browser on another. But it can take me a while to get everything set up. This is where FancyZones really helps. I can create custom zones for each app I use that helps me puts them where I want them, and resizes them, too.\n\nTo set this up for yourself, first go to the FancyZones section in PowerToys utilities. Here, open the Zones Editor and create a new custom layout. You can now use the mouse to move the zones around and to add a new zone. Once a layout is enabled, all you have to do is move a window around and hold down the Shift key. Dropping the window in any designated zone to instantly resize it.",

    "title": "15 Shows Like 'Fallout' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "It's the end of the world and they show it.",
    "fullText": "Prime Video's Fallout, an adaptation of the popular video game series of the same name, is set more than two centuries from now on an Earth still devastated by a long-ago nuclear war between the United States and China. The protagonist, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), emerges from the underground fallout shelter where she's lived her entire life in search of her father, and a fuller understanding of the world above, a wasteland is dominated by warring factions and freakish mutants.\n\nIt's a gutsy, hilarious adaptation of out-there source material, and it's wild to consider that, in the space of a couple of years, we've gone from approximately zero worthwhile video game adaptations to having two series (the other being HBO's The Last of Us) contending for Outstanding series Emmys. Strange days. Yet these two are definitely not the only post-apocalyptic narratives you'll find streaming right now. Here are 15 more to shows, from dramatic, to funny, to everything between, to fuel your end times fantasies. (It's fine, everything's fine, I'm fine lol.)\n\nThis '90s were a great time for post-apocalyptic video games, and the 2020s seem to be a great time to adapt them for TV. The most brutal show on Peacock is based on the vehicular combat games that parents probably hated way more than they hated Fallout (it’s a lot of wild, demolition-derby style action involving smashing and/or blowing up your opponents). It stars Anthony Mackie as John Doe, an effective anchor for the chaos of this lawless future America in which the roads have become battlegrounds. There's tons of clever humor amid the frenetic car-on-car (and car-on-semi, car-on-hearse, -ice cream truck, etc.) action. Things go boom, mostly, and sometimes that’s exactly what you want—it’s the show for the 15-year-old gamer inside all of us. Stream Twisted Metal on Peacock.\n\nRebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who gets wrapped up in an investigation involving the local sheriff (David Oyelowo)—usual procedural stuff, except that the characters all inhabit a massive silo, 144-levels deep, protecting the remaining 10,000 humans from the allegedly poisoned world above. Those running the silo have managed to convince everyone left that only strict adherence to rules and procedures will keep them safe from the dangers outside. This is a more dour, less colorful apocalypse than the one in Fallout—it's a prestige drama that incorporates elements of horror, mystery, and science fiction to tell human stories about fear and control. Two further seasons are coming. Stream Silo on Apple TV+.\n\nWhere The Walking Dead and The Last of Us made prestige television out of the zombie apocalypse, this SyFy channel original is all about treating zombies as a campy, gory good time. Things kick off with a soldier who’s been tasked with transporting a package across country. The package in question is actually a human being, a survivor of a zombie bite who might be able to help create a vaccine (sound familiar?), but the emotional stakes are a lot lower than The Last of Us's tortured trek. It comes from the schlock-masters at The Asylum, purveyors of infamous B-movies like Sharknado, which should tell you all you need to know about the tone. Stream Z Nation on Peacock, Tubi, AMC+, and Shudder.\n\nI've never been particularly convinced that an end-of-the-world narrative needs to be set in the future, and this darkly funny but surprisingly humane show offers up a slice of a real-life apocalypse. Loosely adapting Giovanni Boccaccio's 14th century story collection with hints of Bridgerton-esque swagger, we're taken to plague-ravaged Florence, as a bunch of nobles and attendants make their way across a dangerous landscape to hole up in a countryside villa to wait out the end while draining the liquor supplies—as you would. Rules and social mores are turned upside down, particularly by servant Licisca (Tanya Reynolds), who kind of accidentally kills her lady on the way to the villa and then decides to take her place. Despite being primarily a show about how hell is other people, it makes for an entirely addictive binge experience. Stream The Decameron on Netflix.\n\nAbout 500 years from now, war has eradicated anything resembling civilization and left the planet ravaged, even as some vestiges of technology remain. Still, firearms are largely taboo given the devastation they've caused—allowing for an action apocalypse dominated by kick-ass martial arts combat. The Badlands, Rocky Mountains and Mississippi River are transformed into competing feudal-esque kingdoms, dominated by Marton Csokas's creepy, over-the-top Baron Quinn and, at least initially, his chief lieutenant Sunny (Daniel Wu). Stream Into the Badlands on Prime Video and AMC+.\n\nThis smart, impressively voice-acted, beautifully animated sci-fi epic follows the fates of the stranded survivors of a crashed interstellar cargo ship. The web of natural life on the world on which they find themselves is unusually complex, and the rules of biology they're used to don't seem to apply. The outer space sci-fi setting doesn't, on the surface, have much to do with the blasted desert of Fallout, but both shows are set in imagined worlds that are intricate, colorful, and devilishly clever. Stream Scavengers Reign on HBO Max.\n\nThough initially feeling like an unnecessary extention of Bong Joon Ho's allegorical post-apocalyptic film, Snowpiercer, the show, ultimately takes on a life of its own as a clever sci-fi melodrama, smartly recognizing that there are no heroes and few true villains at the end of the world—it's mostly just people doing whatever they can to survive. In a frozen future (2026, to be precise), humanity survives on an extremely long train that circumnavigates the globe. If it stops, the power will go out and everyone (literally everyone) will die. Those who came aboard with wealth live near the front in relative luxury, while the poor live on scraps (or worse) in the train's tail. Daveed Diggs stars as former detective Andre Layton, a \"Tailie\" deputized by Jennifer Connelly's Melanie Cavill, engineer and the train's Head of Hospitality, to solve a series of murders. The inevitable uprising that follows sets the two of them on different sides of a violent conflict, before each eventually realizes they're just pawns of elites—same as it ever was. Stream Snowpiercer on AMC+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThis anime series makes clear that it definitely isn't 5G that we need to be worried about...it's 7G, an experimental cell network that warps reality and leaves Japan as a series of isolated settlements—it's also caused strange mutations, including turning people into animals, and creating mind-controlling mushrooms à la The Last of Us. Discovering evidence that one of her classmates is alive outside of Tokyo, Shizuru Chikura gets some friend together and they commandeer a train to carry them through the strange new wilderness. Stream Train to the End of the World on Crunchyroll or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nPredating Fallout by just about a year, The Last of Us started what remains an extremely exclusive club of video game adaptations that click, in this case even picking up a bunch of Emmys—Fallout maybe running a bit behind in terms of major awards, but has picked up nominations for Outstanding Drama and Lead Actor Emmys, which ain't too shabby. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey star here, at least initially, as Joel and Ellie, travelers through an apocalyptic wasteland populated by zombified humans infected by a fungus. There's genuine suspense and expertly crafted horror in the show's zombie threat, but it's all built around the dynamic between Joel and Ellie, a beaten-down smuggler and the immune teenager he's being paid to deliver to the other side of the country. Their relationship sells the premise, and makes the stakes feel very real when the zombie mushroom people come out to bite. When the show upends that cart in season two, it's devastating. Stream The Last of Us on HBO Max.\n\nI suppose it says something about our uniquely fun era that you can turn on the TV and take your pick of future dystopias—here we visit a hyper-capitalist future in which everything's hunky-dory, as long as you mostly only care about money. A dark comedy based on the Hugo-Award winning book series by Martha Wells, the show stars Alexander Skarsgård is the title's hilariously deadpan robot, a private \"security construct\" who's managed to hack its way through its own programming and gain free will—which it mostly wants to use to watch its favorite streaming shows. It can't just run off for fear of drawing attention, but the self-named Murderbot (it's being ironic, kinda) is content to do the bare minimum when it's assigned to a team of inexperienced and naive hippie researchers who don't see the need for a killer security robot—at least, not until they're enmeshed in a complicated capitalist plot in which they're all just cogs. Stream Murderbot on Apple TV+.\n\nThe miniseries, based on the Emily St. John Mandel bestseller, was released at either the best time or the worst possible time, the story of a flu pandemic twenty years on hitting HBO square in the middle of COVID—and don't all of our current apocalypse dramas owe just a bit to that waking nightmare? The show follows two tracks, one introducing Kirsten Raymonde, a young stage actor whose performance in a production of King Lear is cut short by the onset of a virus with a 99% fatality rate. We also visit Kirsten twenty years on, still an actor, in a world very much changed. It’s a slow-burn, picking up steam only after a couple of episodes, but ultimately, the series makes a moving case for the power of art, even (or especially) in moments when survival is on the line. Stream Station Eleven on HBO Max.\n\nNo weird mutations here; instead we get an apocalypse that looks disturbingly normal. As the series begins, around 2% of the world's population disappears without explanation—it's enough to upend just about everything. Politics have adapted to the new normal, religions have collapsed and reformed, and families have had to make peace with the inexplicable loss of loved ones. The first season revolves around the Garvey family led by Kevin (Justin Theroux), a sheriff whose wife (Amy Brenneman) left him to join a cult, while subsequent seasons broaden the scope to bring in other characters in other locations. Showrunner Damon Lindelof also co-created Lost, and Leftovers inherits that show's relatively grim tone while doing it one better in sticking a landing. Stream The Leftovers on HBO Max.\n\nWe get a lot of Fallout-esque desert dystopias, but leave it to those melancholy Danes to center an apocalypse around precipitation. In this three-season import, a virus spread by rainfall that wipes out most of the population of Scandinavia. Siblings Simone and Rasmus emerge from their bunker six years later, setting off across Scandinavia with the hope of finding a safe haven, and maybe their father. It turns out that one of them holds the key to wiping out the virus and saving the world. It’s not the most original premise (The Last of Us game came out five years earlier), but the setting gives it a unique feel, and the series comes to a decisive ending. Stream The Rain on Netflix.\n\nOK, so maybe the end of days is feeling a little heavy at this point, and you're looking for something a little brighter and a lot more gay. I got you! New Queer Cinema pioneer Greg Araki followed up his neon-tinged apocalypse in Kaboom with Now Apocalypse, a successor in spirit. Avan Jogia plays Ulysses Zane, living in sun-soaked California with his best friend Carly (Kelli Berglund), a struggling actress and sex worker. He keeps having bizarre dreams about an alien invasion that feel increasingly like they might be premonitions...or possibly just anxiety delusions brought on by too much weed. The show only lasted one season, and never quite made it to its own prophesied apocalypse, but it was definitely fun while it lasted, and definitely offers something a bit to the left of the typical dreary end-of-the-world. Stream Now Apocalypse on Tubi.\n\nAt seven seasons, the CW’s YA The 100 is, currently, our most deeply explored TV apocalypse, telling the story of the descendants of refugees of nuclear devastation who return to Earth from their habitat in space—to encounter the remnants of humanity who’d survived on Earth. Naturally, the first people sent to scope things out are the juvenile delinquents (better them than me, honestly), and they discover that three civilizations that have risen up in the aftermath of the apocalypse, and they are all pretty darned scary (including the inevitable cannibals). The show builds an impressive mythology over the course of its run, leading to a conclusion that’s borderline metaphysical. Buy episodes of The 100 from Prime Video.",

    "description": "White House officials believe that Marjorie Taylor Greene may have tipped off a far-left protest group about Donald Trump's dinner plans last September.",
    "fullText": "White House officials believe that former congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, the superfan-turned-intraparty foe of President Donald Trump, may have tipped off a far-left protest group about Trump’s dinner plans last September.\n\nAccording to Axios’s Alex Isenstadt, a “chaotic confrontation” between Code Pink protesters and Trump at Joe’s Seafood, a Washington, D.C., restaurant that Greene had recommended to the commander-in-chief, “embarrassed the president and intensified concerns in the White House about his safety.”\n\nOfficials told the Secret Service that they suspected that Greene may have informed Code Pink of Trump’s intention of dining at Joe’s that evening.\n\nPer Isenstadt, the White House’s theory relies on two pillars:\n\n1. Her suggesting where Trump should dine\n\nOfficials say that after recommending the president go to Joe’s, Greene repeatedly called White House staffers the day of the dinner to confirm he was going.\n\nAfter Trump heard about Greene’s calls, he called her shortly before leaving the White House and confirmed his planned visit, the sources said.\n\nGreene — who was a regular at the restaurant — didn’t show up there when Trump and other officials were there, which struck some Trump aides as odd.\n\n2. Greene’s relationship with Code Pink\n\nWhite House aides note Greene is friends with Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin.\n\nGreene and the organization are aligned in their opposition to the U.S. providing military aid to Ukraine and Israel.\n\nBenjamin last year praised Greene for opposing Trump’s bombing of nuclear sites in Iran and for calling to strip foreign aid from the Pentagon’s budget.\n\nBoth Greene and Code Pink denied the accusation. The former told Axios that the charge is “an absolute lie, a dangerous lie,” and insisted that while she recommended the establishment to Trump, she didn’t know when he might go.\n\n“That absolutely did not happen, to the point it is comical,” commented Code Pink’s Melissa Garriga.\n\nTrump criticized Greene in a November Oval Office Q&A after Greene broke with him on a number of hot-button issues.\n\n“Yeah, so I don’t know what happened to Marjorie. She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think,” said Trump at the time. “when somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who’s now catering to the other side—I don’t know what, you know, I guess she’s got some kind of an act going—but I’m surprised at her. But when somebody like Marjorie goes over and starts making statements like that, it shows she doesn’t know.”\n\nThe feud only escalated from there.\n\nThe post White House Reportedly Suspects Marjorie Taylor Greene Tipped Off Left-Wing Protesters About Trump Dinner Plans first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The 27-year-old singer did have supporters, too.",
    "fullText": "Country music singer Alexis Wilkins took to social media to share some of her thoughts following the ICE shooting in Minnesota that left Renee Nicole Good dead, and it isn’t going well for her.\n\nWilkins, who is dating FBI Director Kash Patel, lists “political commentator” on her X profile along with country music, and she has not been shy about giving her thoughts on a wide-range of topics.\n\nHer first post about the shooting came in response to Geraldo Rivera, who wrote that Good was unarmed. Wilkins reshared that post and wrote, “Geraldo, she was armed with a CAR.”\n\nShe then shared screenshots of posts from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The post on Frey highlighted his call for ICE to “get the (expletive) out of Minneapolis.” The post from Walz promised a “full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.”\n\n“Minnesota’s leadership encourages disobedience and violence against law enforcement — which breeds situations such as George Floyd and Renee Nicole Good,” she wrote. “This is on your @MayorFrey @GovTimWalz.”\n\n“And where’s this call to violence?” one person replied.\n\n“Are you really this dumb?” another wrote. “George Floyd was killed as everyone in the nation watched. This is what happens when ego-driven men are given power and inadequate training. Your BF is constantly making serious mistakes; he is not qualified for this job. I would keep my mouth shut.”\n\n“Alexis, you are disgusting and pathetic,” another wrote. “Your comments are unfounded. People like you & your ugly googled eyed boyfriend are what is wrong with this country led by the felon, fraud, liar, narcissist, psychopath, sexual assaulter Donald Trump.”\n\n“You’re a terrible person and a worse singer,” another wrote.\n\nAnd those were some of the nicer comments. Several used slurs to attack Wilkins.\n\nMeanwhile, there were some folks who supported her, too.\n\n“Alexis is right she was armed with a car,” one person replied. “She was trying to impede law enforcement. A vehicle is a deadly weapon. Mayor should be impeached for his outrageous comments before any investigation!”\n\nYou can see her post and all of the responses here.\n\nThe 27-year-old singer was last in the headlines back in November amid a report from MS Now that Patel has assigned a security detail to her.\n\nThe outlet reported that Wilkins, who lives and works out of Nashville like a lot of country music artists, has a detail that consists of elite agents who are normally assigned to the SWAT team at the FBI’s Nashville office.\n\n“Ms. Wilkins is receiving a protective detail because she has faced hundreds of credible death threats related to her relationship with Director Patel, whom she has been dating for three years,” an FBI spokesperson told The Hill. “Out of respect for her safety, we will not be providing additional details.”\n\nThe outlet reported that it is “unusual” for the SWAT members to be used for security details, and that other spouses of directors who received details were living with the director. Patel and Wilkins do not live together and do not live in the same city, and the use of the elite agents created a stir on social media.\n\n“There is no legitimate justification for this,” former senior FBI agent Christopher O’Leary told MS Now. “She is not his spouse, does not live in the same house or even the same city.\n\n“I would also add that this comes at a time when security details were stripped from people who are under threat from (Iran).”\n\nTaste of Country reported that Wilkins and Patel have been dating since 2023. The site said they first met at a ReAwaken America event. And, for the most part per the outlet, the romance was off-the-radar until Wilkins stood behind Patel when he was sworn-in as FBI Director in February.\n\nCountry music icon’s heartbreaking post has fans praying: ‘A beautiful tribute’\n\nCountry music icon shares heartfelt message after learning of legend’s death\n\nCountry star’s fans rally behind him as he announces break from stage: ‘I’m exhausted’\n\nCountry music legend dead at 78: ‘An unbelievable loss for country music’",

    "description": "Abraham Lincoln was an American hero — but a flawed one. As we celebrate him, let’s also acknowledge some ugly The post 5 Ugly Abraham Lincoln Facts No One Likes to Talk About appeared first on MovieMaker Magazine.",
    "fullText": "Abraham Lincoln was an American hero — but a flawed one. As we celebrate him, let's also acknowledge some ugly truths that reflect the times in which our our 16th president lived.\n\nPresident Lincoln took a bold and courageous stand for his time, and of course Lincoln was far more advanced in his time than many of his white contemporaries.\n\nBut it's also important to understand our country's real history, and not just the most cheerful version of it. So here are some ugly truths about Lincoln, that go along with the laudable ones.\n\nThe 12 Best Sleazy Movies We’ve Ever Seen\n\n12 Essential Movies of 1975, the Year That Changed Everything\n\n12 Old SNL Characters They Wouldn’t Do Today\n\nLincoln's main goal during his presidency, which began just before the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, was to preserve the Union — not to free slaves.\n\nChristopher Bonner, a historian at the University of Maryland, says in Netflix's historical documentary Amend: \"Lincoln understands that slavery is bad, which is a good start. But he says that if I could save the Union without freeing any slaves, I would do so.\"\n\n\"He has got to get the South back, and at this point, he'll do whatever it takes to win, even if it's at the expense of Black Americans,\" Smith says of Lincoln's thinking at the time.\n\nYou don't have to take the documentary's word for it. You can read Lincoln's August 22, 1862 letter here, in which he states: \"If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that.\"\n\nIn 1861, Abraham Lincoln invited a group of African-American leaders to the White House, according to Columbia University historian Eric Foner. But instead of having a discussion about improving racial equality in America, he further underscored their inequality.\n\nIn Amend, Pedro Pascal reads the address that Lincoln delivered that day.\n\n\"Your race are suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people,\" he said. \"But even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race.\"\n\nIn his aforementioned address, Abraham Lincoln continued:\n\n\"Consider what we know to be the truth, but for your race among us, there could not be war.\"\n\nAgain, you don't have to rely on Netflix to research this. Here is a link to a primary source, \"Lincoln's Address on Colonization to a Deputation of Colored Men.\"\n\n\"There is an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh at it may be, for you, free colored people, to remain with us,\" Lincoln added. \"It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated. The place I am thinking about having for a colony is Central America.\"\n\nYes, at one point, Lincoln wanted to remove Black people from the U.S. altogether.\n\n\"Part of what Lincoln is doing here is trying to get at that gnawing uncertainty in Black people that maybe we can't actually belong in this country,\" Bonner notes. \"He's saying, we all understand that equality is what this country's supposed to be about, but really, racial equality is not gonna happen, so get with the program.\"\n\nFrederick Douglass, the famed abolitionist who traveled the country speaking about his own experiences as a freed former slave, was furious at Lincoln, according to Bonner.\n\nHis solution? To convince Lincoln that he needed Black Americans to win the war, thus encouraging white Americans to view Black Americans as equals.\n\nDouglass argued that Lincoln couldn't win the war without abolishing slavery and that Black men were essential to the war effort, saying that men \"who would be freed themselves must strike the blow.\" His logic was that if Black men shed their blood to fight for their country, then they must be considered citizens. (The painting above depicts him urging Lincoln to let Black men fight for the Union Army.)\n\n\"Douglass is convinced they will prove they are citizens, that they're deserving of rights, and that they're deserving of legal equality,\" Bonner adds.\n\nDouglass' plan worked: Although at the time Lincoln couldn't \"conceive of the United States as a biracial society,\" as Foner points out, \"his views will begin to move forward very dramatically.\"\n\nFoner adds: \"The Emancipation Proclamation is issued as a military order. It's to help win the war.\"\n\nThe painting above depicts the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first all-Black Union regiment, fighting for their country and freedom.\n\nFeel free to share your objections in the comments and share sources. We love open debate about our country's history.\n\nAmend: The Fight for America is now streaming on Netflix.\n\nThe 12 Best Sleazy Movies We’ve Ever Seen\n\n12 Essential Movies of 1975, the Year That Changed Everything\n\n12 Old SNL Characters They Wouldn’t Do Today",

    "fullText": "Mason-based uniform provider Cintas Corp. once again wants to acquire UniFirst, a Massachusetts rival.\n\nCintas, a Fortune 500 company, submitted a proposal on Dec. 12 to buy UniFirst for $275 for each share of stock in an all-cash deal, totaling around $5.2 billion.\n\nCintas has made multiple bids to acquire UniFirst since 2022. Its previous bid briefly turned hostile last year after Cintas appealed directly to UniFirst shareholders after being rejected by the target company's board of directors. The company said it ended those discussions in March 2025.\n\n\"We remain unwavering in our conviction that combining Cintas and UniFirst would deliver considerable benefits for customers, employee-partners and shareholders,\" Todd Schneider, Cintas president and CEO, said in a news release. \"Accordingly, we have reiterated our compelling $275 per share all-cash offer to the UniFirst board and are reaffirming our commitment to move swiftly to complete a transaction.\"\n\nThis time around, UniFirst hasn't said \"no\" yet, but hasn't agreed either. In a Dec. 22 statement, it acknowledged it had received the offer and said it is evaluating the bid.\n\n\"UniFirst does not intend to comment further on Cintas’ proposal until the Board has completed its review,\" the Massachusetts company said.\n\nUniFirst, like Cintas, provides uniforms and other products and services to businesses, though on a much smaller scale than the Mason-based company. Cintas reported $10.3 billion in revenue for the 2025 fiscal year, while UniFirst reported $2.4 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Cintas proposes $5.2 billion bid to buy UniFirst",

    "description": "‘You would never find a nicer, kinder person,' Ed Ross said",
    "fullText": "The father of Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who fatally shot Renee Good in Minnesota, has come forward to defend his son’s actions and believes he will be cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\n“He will not be charged with anything,” Ed Ross, 80, told The Daily Mail, describing his son as a “tremendous” person of whom he is deeply proud.\n\nJonathan Ross fatally shot Good, a 37-year-old mother-of-three, on a Minneapolis street Wednesday after she was confronted by him and other agents in her vehicle.\n\nVideo footage shows Good in a maroon SUV idling on an icy street occupied by several government vehicles. As Ross and other agents approach, they order her to “get out of the car,” and one reaches through the driver’s side window. When the SUV begins to move forward, Ross, who is standing near the driver's side of the car, draws his firearm and fires multiple rounds at the vehicle, which then crashes a short distance away.\n\nThe incident has become a national flashpoint with the Trump administration accusing Good of trying to run over Ross and labeling the act “domestic terrorism,” while state and local authorities condemned the ICE agent’s response as reckless and said that his life was never in danger.\n\n“She hit him,” Ed Ross told The Daily Mail. “He also had an officer whose arm was in the car. He will not be charged with anything.”\n\n“You would never find a nicer, kinder person,” the father, who is from Illinois, added. “He's a committed, conservative Christian, a tremendous father, a tremendous husband. I couldn't be more proud of him.”\n\nRoss, 43, was identified as the shooter by multiple media outlets Thursday. It was also reported that he had been dragged by a car during a separate immigration enforcement operation last year, requiring him to receive over two dozen stitches. Vice President JD Vance said Thursday that the incident left him “a little bit sensitive.”\n\nA DHS spokesperson told The Independent they would not “expose the name” of the agent who shot Good, but added that he had worked for ICE for over 10 years.\n\nEd Ross told The Daily Mail that his son’s wife, a Filipino immigrant, is an American citizen, though he didn’t say how long she has lived in the U.S. “I don’t want to go any further than that,” he said.\n\n“The wife is polite, very nice, very outgoing,” one neighbor also said. “They have a couple of kids.”\n\nRoss is an Iraq war veteran. In 2017, his father posted a photo on Facebook of his son clad in fatigues and carrying a rifle with the caption “Jon Ross in Iraq.” The ICE agent purchased a home in the Minneapolis area in 2015 with a loan from the Veterans Administration, the outlet noted, citing property records.\n\nNeighbors said that Jonathan Ross is “a hardcore MAGA supporter,” with one noting that they’d seen Trump stickers and a “Don’t Tread On Me” flag — often associated with opposition to government overreach — outside his home.",

    "title": "Trump Hurled A 2-Word Insult. It Revealed Something Deeply Troubling About Him — And Our Country.",
    "description": "\"It is not a passing insult but an alarm bell, reverberating against barriers I have spent my career trying to overcome.\"",
    "fullText": "As a neurologist, I care for some of society’s most vulnerable individuals — children with severe disabilities who are often mocked, dismissed or misunderstood. My career is rooted in supporting people with physical and cognitive differences, educating about empathy and respect for human diversity, and applying the principles of science and medicine to improve the lives of those facing challenges of one kind or another.\n\nFrom that perspective, President Donald Trump’s public admonition of a female reporter in November — “Quiet, piggy” — was gut-wrenching and continues to resonate weeks later. To some, it was an offhand, albeit misogynistic, fat-shaming insult. To me, the remark instantly evoked Piggy, the vulnerable and marginalized character in William Golding’s novel “Lord of the Flies” and revealed something far more troubling: a display of dominance, denigration and the subjugation of those deemed less worthy.\n\nAlso Read: After My Baby Died, I Saw 4 Words On A Standard Form At The Doctor's Office That Stopped Me Cold\n\nThe rapid spread of the phrase across media platforms underscored a deeper danger — one that has only grown more unsettling as public displays of intimidation and condemnation increase. It is not just the cruelty of the words but the authority of the speaker, and the delight of many in his audience, that makes them so corrosive.\n\nAs some media outlets bow to Trump, HuffPost won’t back down. We’re committed to relentlessly reporting on his actions and holding power accountable every step of the way. Support fearless journalism — join our membership program today.\n\n“Quiet, piggy” is not a joke. It is an illustration of how normalized bullying has become, and an affront to the people I care for and the values that guide my work.\n\nOthers have drawn parallels between “Lord of the Flies” and our political moment. In 2020, The New York Times published Jennifer Finney Boylan’s essay “President of the Flies,” in which she described feeling cast onto “some cruel and hostile strand ... where people with disabilities were mocked, immigrants ... were reviled, and grabbing women by their private parts was ... A-OK.”\n\nHealth: Therapists Warn This Normalized Trump Behavior Is Causing Real-World Harm\n\nBoylan compared the “Flies” boys’ descent into savagery with a society in which democratic norms erode, expertise is dismissed and cruelty is sanctioned. Her metaphor captured profound moral decay and warned of the danger of unchecked power divorced from reason, science and shared truth.\n\nYet even as Boylan wrote, darker chapters still lay ahead: the attack on the U.S. Capitol; the dismantling of asylum protections; and the normalization of aggressive immigration enforcement tactics stripping primarily people of color of due process. What began as boasts about grabbing women’s bodies metastasized into a broader posture of possession — an expanding sense of what can be seized without consequence: democratic institutions, marginalized populations beyond our borders and — most recently — entire territories and nations framed as objects to be claimed. Golding captured this descent in “Lord of the Flies,” where casual cruelty gradually hardens into loss of restraint and hunger for control.\n\nThese events raise a troubling question: What has become of a society that greets such assertions of entitlement with indifference — or even approval? When the targets are distant, vulnerable or politically inconvenient, outrage seems to dissipate. Increasingly, the United States feels less like a democratic exemplar than a cautionary tale of how quickly ethical bearings can be lost.\n\nIn Golding’s novel, Piggy is intelligent, physically fragile and socially marginalized. He is mocked — and ultimately killed — for the very qualities that make him indispensable. When his glasses, the symbol of knowledge and reason, are shattered, civilization collapses into savagery.\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\nThe parallels today are difficult to ignore. Scientific expertise is ridiculed. Anti-vaccine rhetoric is elevated. Universities are portrayed as threats. Books are banned, history sanitized and facts themselves rendered suspect. Like Piggy’s broken glasses, our collective means of illumination is being smashed.\n\nAs a physician, I see the consequences of this erosion. Public health experts are harassed. Families distrust lifesaving medical advice. Vulnerable children absorb a cultural message that intellect and difference make them contemptible. What makes this moment especially dangerous is not merely who initiates the cruelty but who echoes it.\n\nIn “Lord of the Flies,” it is not Jack, the overt villain, who says “Quiet, Piggy,” but Ralph, the boy aligned with order and conscience. This is the moral creep Boylan warned about: the moment when those who believe themselves principled begin to accommodate degradation. That is what made the aftermath of this remark so disturbing. Piggy memes spread widely — not only among Trump supporters, but among critics and political leaders who claim to reject his politics. The very behaviors we teach children to avoid — mockery, humiliation, ridicule — have become entertainment, modeled by adults in positions of authority.\n\nThis casual embrace of cruelty — and the willingness to look away as acts of intimidation, coercion and lawlessness accumulate — reveals something deeper. “Quiet, piggy” conveys that bullying is acceptable, vulnerability is shameful, intellect is unwelcome and force — not dialogue — is the currency of public life. It is not a passing insult but an alarm bell, reverberating against barriers I have spent my career trying to overcome.\n\nAlso Read: My Parents Wanted To Adopt More Kids — After I Started Having My Own. Here's What I Didn't Expect To Feel.\n\nIn Golding’s novel, the Beast is an imagined external threat, but it is Simon who speaks the most unsettling truth before he, too, is murdered: “Maybe there is a beast. Maybe it’s only us.”\n\nThe greatest danger is not a single leader, but a collective moral drift — a human capacity for dehumanization when norms collapse. Leaders do not invent this darkness; they unlock it.\n\nWe are not innocent bystanders. History shows where dehumanization leads — not through lone tyrants, but through ordinary people who acclimate to the erosion of decency. Like Golding’s boys, we have shown ourselves willing to normalize cruelty, relish humiliation and allow the expanding reach of those in power to go unchallenged. We cannot reclaim innocence, but as professionals, parents, educators and voters, we can resist the further unraveling of our civic soul.\n\nAlso Read: What’s The Secret To A Longer Life? Experts Say This Is The Single Best Thing You Can Do.\n\nAs we start a new year, the question remains, more urgently now than ever:\n\nWho will save us, if not ourselves?\n\nJennifer Lederman Friedman, M.D., is a physician in San Diego and a Clinical Professor in the Departments of Neurosciences and Pediatrics at the University of California San Diego.

    "description": "Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke, as well as creative directors, recently participated in an AMA on Reddit to set expectations for the studio’s upcoming Divinity game, particularly about its stance on generative AI--a hot-button topic in the industry right now. Responding to a fan question about the role of generative AI in game development, Vincke was rather blunt: \"There is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.\"\nHis comments arrive amid wider debate over how and whether AI should be used in creative processes, especially as some high-profile games have faced backlash for such use. One notable example is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the acclaimed RPG that had two Indie Game Awards (including Game of the Year and Debut Game) rescinded when it was revealed the title had included AI-generated assets during development, violating strict no-AI rules--even though those assets were patched out later.\nIn the AMA, Vincke acknowledged that previous discussions about experimenting with AI tools for concept-art had been confusing.",

He said, \"It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, 'no f**king AI assets.",

    "fullText": "Tucker Carlson argued reactions from conservatives to the ICE shooting of a 37-year-old mother in Minneapolis are showing just how “desensitized” Americans really are.\n\n“How come so few conservatives are viewing this story through a human lens?” Carlson asked in a newsletter for his network subscribers this week.\n\nThe post goes on to mention liberals who celebrated the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk back in September.\n\n“Say, when something similar, like the killing of Charlie Kirk, happens on the other side, did many on the left celebrate because they thought his political positions were wrong? We have a guess,” the post reads. “Violence around the world is desensitizing Americans to violence at home.”\n\nRenee Good was shot and killed this week by an ICE agent who has been identified as Jonathan Ross. ICE officials have insisted the officer acted in self defense and accused Good of using her vehicle as a weapon, a narrative local officials like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) have rejected.\n\n“The 37-year-old was an American citizen and reportedly the mother of a kindergarten-aged child. Did we disagree with her views on immigration? Probably. But that shouldn’t matter,” Carlson’s newsletter reads. “Her death is a tragedy, regardless of her partisan affiliations, ideological beliefs, or who pulled the trigger. A woman was shot in the face.”\n\nCarlson accused American leaders of “normalizing bloodshed” around the globe, citing authorities capturing Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and the wars between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas.\n\n“America’s leaders must stop normalizing bloodshed,” the post reads. “That means pulling the plug on ethnic cleansing, viewing war as the last option rather than the first, and please, for the love of God, no more Lindsey Graham frothing over the titillating excitement of KILLING PEOPLE.”\n\nThe post Tucker Carlson Asks Why Conservatives Can’t View Renee Good Shooting Through ‘Human Lens’: ‘A Woman Got Shot in the Face’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

Formed by Hypixel developers, who run one of the most successful Minecraft servers of all time, Hytale formerly had funding from Riot Games who then went on to purchase the studio outright in 2020. Riot canceled Hytale in June 2025, but its original founder repurchased the game in mid November 2025 and recommenced development. Now, the game is entering early access in what the Hypixel team admits will be laced with \"bugs, rough edges, and unbalanced content.\"\n\nAs part of Hypixel's dedication to its potential playerbase, it allowed modders to get their hands on the game ahead of release to identify, plan, and develop the best mods possible. From increased luck during mining, custom plots, new items, and intriguing game modes, here are the best Hypixel mods to use from launch. Hypixel has confirmed that it has partnered with Curseforge to host mods, and this should lead to a pretty seamless installation process thanks to the Curseforge launcher.\n\nAnyone who's played Minecraft's player-created custom modes will be familiar with Skyblock. You're placed on an amount of terrain high in the sky, with limited resources. It's your job to expand your Skyblock, increase your well of resources, and proceed through the game. While Hypixel's storyline will differ from Minecraft's, obviously, transferring the Skyblock concept seems to be one of the more obvious mods you should try out. It's created by Cinder Stone Studios, and will be available via Curseforge at launch.\n\nMrbysco and their partner ShyNieke have been working on the Gone Fishing mod, which pretty much does what it says on the tin. While fishing is a vanilla inclusion in Minecraft, Hytale doesn't feature the mechanic at launch. By installing the mod you can spend all day fishing in Hytale if that's your dream, and from a short clip posted to Mrbysco's X page, we know that the user interface in the lower left corner will even identify the type of fish you've caught.\n\nThe Simply Trash mod by Jaredlll08 adds a trash can to quickly get rid of unwanted items. If you've ever found yourself with a full inventory of items you don't care about in Minecraft, you've probably created a lava bin to burn them--but this can be timely and frustrating. Jared's trash can seems to remove that problem, making inventory management even easier.\n\nWhen building a structure, village, or even just decorating some paths, switching between various blocks to add texture and interesting patterns is a necessity in vanilla Hytale. With the AutoHammer mod from tr7zw, select from variants of the same block type and AutoHammer will randomize which one is placed down.\n\nThis is technically a group of mods from one creator, but Sketch Macaw's mods are infamous in the Minecraft community, with hundreds of millions of installations. Macaw adds various paintings, paths, bridges, windows, lighting options, and more. Their paintings mod means you can easily switch between which paintings appear on the canvases you place, while their multiple furniture mods make customization more varied than you can imagine. We'd argue the bundle of Macaw's Mods are almost essential to install for your Hytale world. Check out Macaw's showcase to see the mods in action. They've even developed NEP - Not Enough Poops. We're in the dark about why poop is so important in Hytale, but it's good to see Macaw thinks we'll need even more.\n\nIf you're anything like me, inventory management is an ongoing struggle in most sandbox and survival games. I start off with the best of intentions, manually organizing my loot into easy-to-find locations. If I'm feeling particularly organized, they might even be in alphabetical order. Before long though, I've been on so many adventures and acquired so much random loot that my system goes out of the window completely. That's why Buuz135's WhereThisAt? mod will be one of the first that I install for Hytale. Search nearby inventories using the Inventory Lectern to find the item, and even pull it into your inventory.\n\nImmersive Melodies is another mod that's popular in Minecraft, which creator Conczin has managed to port over to Hytale. A bundle of 25 songs is playable on seven instruments, or you can upload your own melodies. It works in multiplayer, meaning you can form a band with your friends or just annoy them as you chase them around your base yelling Blink-182's All The Small Things in their headsets. Hours of fun ... for you, probably not for them.\n\nAnother mod from Buuz135 is Lucky Mining. It gives a small chance for ores to spread to adjacent blocks while mining. You'll know whether this has happened by a helpful particle effect and accompanying sound effect. It's a simple mod, but in those early stages where resources are limited and you're trying to progress, it can prove invaluable.\n\nA simple UI and quality-of-life improvement mod, the Better Modlist is another contribution from Buuz135. This modlist combines mods and packs and shows information about them in-game. It's a handy way to see everything you've got installed at once, as well as their effects.\n\nIf you're out on a long expedition to get materials, the last thing you want to do is run around the world chasing down the drops. In Jaredlll08's Item Magnet mod, anything you chop down, mine, or drop will be automatically magnetized to you and added to your inventory. It might feel simple, but it'll shave valuable time off your resource-gathering missions.",

Obviously, that means you can't unlock it until every set of quests is available.\n\nThe event pass does not include any skins, but the item shop has a bundle of five skins--Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, Stan, and Butters in mech suits--for 4,000 V-Bucks, as well as the Towelie sidekick, which is sold separately.

We'll also update this list as more manga titles get the deluxe edition treatment.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest manga series of all time, Berserk is a dark fantasy saga that pulls no punches. Created by the late Kentaro Miura, the series follows Guts on his revenge-fueled quest against Griffith, his former brother-in-arms who betrayed the swordsman and his fellow mercenaries so that he could ascend to godhood. Beautifully illustrated and written, Berserk has been cited as an inspiration to other famous comic books and video games, notably FromSoftware and its Souls series.\n\nThe series is available in a 14-volume Deluxe Edition series.\n\nVagabond examines how one of Japan's most famous historical figures, Miyamoto Musashi, became the patron saint of swordsmen. The series explores the man behind the myth back when he was still known as Shinmen Takezou.\n\nYasuhiro Nightow's cult-classic Trigun manga series follows Vash the Stampede, a pacifistic gunslinger with a billion-dollar bounty on his head--as he tries to avert the disasters that follow in his wake across an alien planet where humanity is barely hanging on.\n\nThe original manga series is available in the Trigun Deluxe Edition, which collects Trigun Volumes 1 and 2 in one stunning hardcover that clocks in at almost 700 pages. The sequel series, Trigun Maximum, also received the Deluxe Edition treatment. Volumes 1-4 are available now, while Volume 5 is available to preorder ahead of its June 17 release.\n\nHow do you fight back against Nazi vampires and other supernatural menaces lurking in the dark? By unleashing an even bigger monster to brutally exterminate them, that's how. Hellsing remains a firm favorite with fans of dark supernatural stories, and the original manga is a masterclass in violence thanks to its lead character. Imaginatively illustrated and featuring a protagonist who's harder to kill than an atomic-powered honey badger, Hellsing is a bloody amount of fun. The full series is available in three Deluxe Edition volumes.\n\nVinland Saga is an epic tale of war, revenge, and the tragedy accompanying a life of constant bloodshed. The anime adaptation of it has been very well-received, but the manga is still an incredible work of art that should be essential reading for any fan of the medium. While the story is a fictionalized account of Thorfinn Karlsefni and his expedition to find Vinland, it does feature a high level of historical accuracy that makes for fascinating reading.\n\nThe series is still ongoing, and so far has seen six Deluxe Edition volumes release, with Deluxe Edition Volumes 7 and 8 launching later this year and available to preorder.\n\nYou've probably read your fair share of samurai stories, but nothing compares to Blade of the Immortal. Featuring a nigh-unkillable protagonist, the series has earned acclaim for its fusion of period samurai action and modern ideas--and brutal violence. Mangaka Hiroaki Samura's entire saga has been collected into 10 Deluxe Edition, starting from the original volumes and leading through to the bloody finale.\n\nOne of the best manga series of the early '90s, Battle Angel Alita is regarded as a cult classic in the cyberpunk genre. The Battle Angel Alita hardcover edition does justice to the story, as it contains the complete manga run, a collection of short stories that were previously only available in Japanese, three art cards, multiple interviews with creator Yukito Kishiro, and an alternate ending to the original series.\n\nArguably the gold standard in the cyberpunk genre, Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell was a groundbreaking piece of work when it was first published. Ghost in the Shell: Fully Compiled is an 832-page hardcover reprinting of the original Ghost in the Shell manga that ran from 1989 through 1990. It also includes notes on the series, all of the original cover pages, and a brand-new cover by Shirow.\n\n$119 (was $140) | Releases Februrary 17\n\nThe new Legacy Edition is a deluxe reprint of the original manga, and it includes censored content that Shirow originally removed for western release of the manga. The box set also includes bonus materials, such as limited-edition prints, a set of multicolored Fuchikoma robot stickers, a double-sided poster, and a premium slipcase featuring brand-new illustrations by Shirow.\n\nYou're probably familiar with Akira through its landmark animated film, but the movie was only a slice of the full story. Anyone looking to experience the complete work will want to check out the manga, and this 35th Anniversary Box Set is the best way to do so, as this version features an all-new English translation that restores the original right-to-left reading format and creator Katsuhiro Otomo's original hand-drawn sound effects. The set includes the full Akira manga series across six hardcover volumes, plus an art book, an exclusive pill patch, and a display box.\n\nLike the 35th Anniversary edition, the hardcovers use the updated translation and lettering of the 35th Anniversary Edition box set. Each book is a large-sized 7\" x 10\" collectible and the original Japanese-language hand-drawn sound effects from the manga have been restored.\n\nThe Sailor Moon: Naoko Takeuchi Collection Box Set includes hardcover editions of the first six volumes of the original manga series, plus an exclusive set of 16 art cards and a holographic display box decorated with metallic silver ink.\n\nStudio Ghibli's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind was originally adapted from studio co-founder Hayao Miyazaki's 1982 manga, and while the film version is a masterpiece, it only adapts one part of Miyazaki's original epic. So if you've ever wanted to see more of Nausicaa's engrossing post-post-apocalyptic world, you'll want to pick up the Hardcover Box Set, which contains the entire run across two hardcover books, each of which clocking in at over 500 pages. The set also includes an ornate display box featuring art from the manga and a bonus poster.\n\nSeveral manga series from the master of horror, Junji Ito, have been collected into deluxe editions. These include his unsettling masterpiece Uzumaki, the stomach-churning apocalyptic tale of Gyo, and the anthology series Tomie. Each hardcover edition includes the full series, as well as several bonus materials that go behind the scenes on the development of their frightening tales.\n\nThe original Oldboy manga from the '90s is still a gripping tale of revenge and mystery, and these were recently collected into a pair of deluxe hardcover editions. Both volumes feature metallic silver foil paper on their covers, a ribbon bookmark, and a 7\" x 10\" page size, which is larger than the standard manga format. They also feature brand-new English translations and updated lettering.\n\nLone Wolf and Cub originally ran for 28 volumes from 1970 through 1976, and the legendary series is getting a brand-new reprint. Both editions are printed in an oversized 7\" x 10\" format, with covers that feature a grainy texture, burnishing, and foil-stamped lettering.\n\nBefore there was Ghost in the Shell, there was Appleseed. Masamune Shirow's cult-classic sci-fi cyberpunk series is getting upgraded for its deluxe edition, featuring wraparound cover art, full-color end sheets, a ribbon bookmark, and gilded edges.\n\nThe debut manga series by Vinland Saga creator Makoto Yukimura, Planetes is a thought-provoking and surprisingly grounded look at interstellar travel. Published from 2015 through 2016, these hardcover books feature copper gilding on their edges, raised lettering on the covers, and are printed on high-quality 7 x 10-inch paper. Each book also comes with dozens of pages of full-color art.\n\nFollowing a successful Kickstarter campaign, Hisao Tamaki's adaptation of Star Wars: A New Hope is getting a unique reprint. This version collects high-resolution scans of Tamaki's original art boards for the first volume, and the manga art is presented alongside an all-new translation of the original Japanese lettering. This means that all the blemishes and production touches that are normally edited out before print--such as ink bleeds between panels, handwritten notes, and other elements from the illustration process--have all been retained for this release.\n\nThe cult-classic manga that inspired a genre-defining movie is back, as writer Koushun Takami and artist Masayuki Taguchi's seminal work is getting the deluxe edition treatment. Details on what you can expect from this reprint are light, but in case you missed it the first time it was printed, Battle Royale is adapted from the 2000 novel of the same name, and it tells the story of 42 high school students forced to fight each to the death until only a single survivor remains.",

    "description": "Exclusive interview: Dubois is aiming to add to her WBC title, fresh off a victory on the Paul vs Joshua undercard",
    "fullText": "Caroline Dubois is dialling up the pressure on Terri Harper in a bid to collect another world title.\n\nDubois took the next step in her career in December, signing with Jake Paul’s company Most Valuable Promotions (MVP) before fighting on the undercard of the YouTuber-turned-boxer’s loss to Anthony Joshua.\n\nAlso holding belts in the division are WBA champion Stephanie Han, IBF title-holder Elif Nur Turhan, and WBO champ Harper. And it’s Harper who is occupying the attention of her fellow Briton, Dubois.\n\n“I’ve been calling out Terri for a while now, and she would know that’s the fight I want,” Dubois, 24, told The Independent. “We’re both British fighters, we both represent the same things, we both have a belt, we’re both on the same platform and promotion, so it makes so much sense for us to fight next.\n\n“I’ve been calling for it for a while, you know? She just has to see that and make it happen. At the end of the day, I can’t drag anyone into the ring, I can’t force them to do anything. They have to agree to it, and that’s the amazing thing about boxing.\n\n“I imagine that from my side, I will be going 100 per cent for the Terri Harper fight. It’s just on her side to agree and accept.”\n\nDubois became WBC champion in December 2024, when Katie Taylor vacated the regular title. She has since retained the belt against Jessica Camara, against whom she drew, and Bo Mi Re Shin and Panatta – both of whom she outpointed.\n\nStill, the young Briton is highly touted and has not had the chance to test herself against the kind of names that fans and pundits desire. But Dubois is trying to find a balance of applying pressure and maintaining patience.\n\n“I believe what is for you is for you, and what isn’t for you is always gonna pass you by,” she said. “So, don’t rush it. I’m only 24, so there’s literally no rush. I know there are big fights on the horizon and I’m on the cusp now.\n\n“I can’t step back and continue fighting people that people don’t know. I have to step up and fight big names, I have to unify the division. I imagine that the big fights are coming, and when I say that, I mean next – names that people are really excited for. I genuinely feel that way.\n\n“I think there’s gonna be some really huge fights for women’s boxing, for boxing, and my name will be involved in that mix. So, I don’t feel any frustration or anything, I know it’s coming.”\n\nDubois’s win in December not only marked her debut under the MVP banner but also her US debut, as she took to the ring in Miami, Florida. Furthermore, the fight marked her debut on Netflix, which reportedly drew over 30m viewers for Paul’s sixth-round defeat by Joshua.\n\n“It was amazing to fight on that card,” Dubois said. “It was really cool, very surreal. [But] I’d say that, because I didn’t really know a lot of the fighters on the card, I was very good at focusing on my own fight, so it never overawed me or made me feel overwhelmed.\n\n“When I got out there, I kept expecting the weigh-in, the press conference, all of that stuff [to give me] an ‘oh, my God’ moment. But once I got there, it just became another day. I was relaxed.\n\n“I guess it comes from the fact that I fought on Sky Sports. I guess we underestimate how big a platform that is. I’ve fought on really big platforms, and that helped prep me for fighting on Netflix.”\n\nDubois’s deal with MVP, which follows her exit from Boxxer, could mean more US outings and fewer on home soil, but she said: “Potentially. I hope not. I hope I still have the opportunities to fight at home.\n\n“But I know MVP are not only trying to be an American promotion, they’re trying to branch out like the other massive promotions – Matchroom, Queensberry. I’m certain that they’ll do that; they’ve signed so many British fighters, it makes sense to do a show in England.”",

    "fullText": "Adekoya is a very tall (193cm) centre-back. The aspect of his game that stands-out immediately is his composure on the ball and his speed.\n\nIn possession he has excellent technical ability for a centre-back. He is a good carrier of the ball. Comfortable at carrying and passing the ball with both feet. In the 28 games available on Wyscout he attempted 27 dribbles for Burnley’s academy sides over the last two seasons and completed 24 of his attempts. This came out to an average of 1 dribble per 90 minutes and a completion rate of over 88%.\n\nBecause of his ability to use both feet comfortably, he can play as a right-sided and left-sided centre-back. He’s got long legs and is quite slim but muscular with a strong core, and as we mentioned above he’s quick so he deals well with physical challenges.\n\nTo illustrate, he won 74% of his 5.3 defensive duels per 90 and 78% of his 4.45 aerial duels per 90 for Burnley at youth level.\n\nThe only question mark is about his distribution of the ball. Burnley tend to play quite a direct style of football and do not keep a lot of possession, so he goes long often. He’s effective at doing this and has a nice range, but the sample size of him playing neater/line-breaking passes on the ground is a lot smaller. It’ll be interesting to see how this develops at Liverpool.",

    "fullText": "Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris has revealed that Wilson Isidor has trained with the squad ahead of their FA Cup tie against Everton.\n\nIsidor has been sidelined since featuring as a substitute in the Black Cats’ stalemate with Manchester City on New Year’s Day, but his involvement in first-team training has raised hopes of a possible return this weekend.\n\n“He is getting better,” Le Bris said.\n\n“He trained this morning with the squad and we’ll see if he is available or not.\n\n“Yes [he is touch-and-go], but we don’t want to take any unnecessary risks so we will see.”\n\nIn a demanding run that includes four games in nine days, Le Bris acknowledged that the cup tie could provide an opportunity to rotate his squad and give minutes to players who have featured less frequently.\n\n“New game, new energy,” he said. “We want to go strong, because we respect this competition.\n\n“At the same time, we will have to manage the load of a few players. At the minute, we don’t have the full picture, because the schedule is so busy so every hour is useful to understand exactly the situation.\n\n“We won’t take unnecessary risks, but we will select the best team possible, so we will see.”\n\nHowever, Le Bris admits that fatigue is a problem that has caused them trouble, having lost 3-0 to Brentford in the week, marking their first loss in over a month.\n\n“Regarding the game against Brentford, they were strong, first of all,” he said.\n\n“It was a tough challenge. They are in good form. I think until the penalty miss, it was still possible to manage the game. After that, the momentum swung and it was totally different. It could’ve been heavier at the end.\n\n“When you don’t take those moments, especially away from home, against a strong side, the league is relentless. We know that,” he continued.\n\n“So, fatigue, maybe, but it’s not an excuse. This was the case for Brentford as well. We are learning. It’s a tough league and it is still really important to experience those situations to grow.”",

    "fullText": "Why did Mario Cristobal leave Oregon? Revisiting 2021 decision that led to Dan Lanning hire originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMario Cristobal's fourth season at Miami saw him lead the Hurricanes to their first-ever College Football Playoff, an accomplishment that ignited a fan base desperate for a return to national relevance.\n\nCristobal, who played at Miami from 1989–1992, was previously the head coach at Oregon for five seasons before accepting the head coaching job in Coral Gables.\n\nIn his 15 years as a head coach, his tenure in Eugene marked his first and only coaching stop outside of South Florida.\n\nLet’s take a look back at Cristobal’s departure from Oregon, as well as his coaching career in Eugene.\n\nMORE: Why Miami doesn't have its own football stadium\n\nMario Cristobal was hired by Oregon before the 2018 season. He was previously on Ducks head coach Willie Taggart’s staff in 2017 and was named the interim head coach after Taggart left for Florida State. Just three days later, the school removed the interim tag and made him Oregon’s permanent head coach.\n\nPrior to joining Taggart’s staff, Cristobal was an assistant at Alabama from 2013-16 under Nick Saban. He was Florida International’s head coach from 2007-12, following nearly a decade as a collegiate assistant.\n\nCristobal was Oregon’s head coach from 2018-21. He enjoyed a successful run with the Ducks, with his best season coming in 2019. That year, Oregon finished 12-2, capped by a Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin. Following a 10-2 regular season in 2021, Cristobal surprisingly left to accept the head coaching job at Miami, which had just fired Manny Diaz.\n\nWhile the news shocked the Oregon fan base, Cristobal told ESPN’s Paul Finebaum he couldn’t turn down the opportunity to return to his alma mater.\n\n“Honestly, Paul, it was the most difficult decision I’ve ever had to make,” Cristobal said in Jan. 2022 via On3Sports. “It was grueling, it was very suddenly put on our family. It was difficult, but at the same time, a tremendous blessing. The x-factor being, more than it just being home, this is actually where I played. I wore this helmet, I wore this uniform. I have blood in this one, you know.\n\n\"We’ve got to feel good about the fact that when we arrived at Oregon, Oregon was 4-8,” Cristobal added.\n\n“And upon leaving, you’re looking at a team that has gone to 3-straight conference titles, won two of them. Won a Rose Bowl, 3-straight top ten picks. They are sitting on the most talent they have ever had there, so, it’s been left in a great place. They treated us great there. We are super grateful and thankful, but all focus is on Miami. We know what Miami is and why Miami does it right, so we are excited.”\n\nCristobal's playing and coaching career began at Miami. Cristobal was born in Miami, Fla., and played high school football at Christopher Columbus High School there. From 1989-1992, Cristobal played offensive line for the Canes under Hall of Fame coach Dennis Erickson. He was part of two national title teams in 1989 and 1991, and was named a First-Team All-Big East tackle during his 1992 season.\n\nMORE:Looking back at Oregon coach Dan Lanning’s little-discussed playing career\n\nCristobal finished with a 35-13 overall record at Oregon. He is currently the school’s seventh-winningest head coach, behind his successor Dan Lanning, Chip Kelly and Mike Bellotti.\n\nCristobal’s 2018 Ducks finished 9-4 during his first season — a year capped by a Redbox Bowl victory over Michigan State. He improved on that in 2019, leading Oregon to a Big Ten championship and Rose Bowl victory.\n\nDuring the shortened COVID-19 season in 2020, Oregon finished 4-3 while winning another Big Ten title. In 2021, the Ducks reached a third consecutive Big Ten title game but fell 38-10 to Utah to finish 10-2. Cristobal left for the Miami job a few days later.\n\nMORE: Looking back at the Alabama staff that produced Dan Lanning and a number of other big-name coaches\n\nCristobal earned a reputation as a strong recruiter throughout his career. While at Alabama in 2015, he was named the top recruiter in the country by 247Sports.\n\nHis reputation only grew in Oregon, where he successfully recruited three Top-10 NFL draft picks in Kayvon Thibodeaux (2022), Penei Sewell (2021) and Justin Herbert (2020). His 2019 class, which included Thibodeaux, finished ranked No. 7 in the country, and his 2021 class ranked sixth in the country per 247Sports.\n\nCristobal started his coaching career at his alma mater as a graduate assistant from 1998-2020. From there, he spent three seasons at Rutgers from 2001-2003, coaching both the offensive tackles and tight ends before moving to the offensive line in 2003.\n\nHe then returned to his alma mater, joining Larry Coker's staff at Miami from 2004-2006 as his tight ends coach. He was then hired as Florida International's head coach from 2007-2012, helping lead the Panthers to two straight bowl appearances in 2010 and 2011. His last season, FIU finished 3-9 in 2012, and was fired in Dec. 2022.\n\nHe was actually briefly hired by Miami in Jan. 2013 before joining Nick Saban's staff at Alabama, where he was named assistant head coach, offensive lines coach and recruiting coordinator six weeks later. He helped the Tide win the national title in 2015.\n\nFollowing his 35-13 record over his five seasons at Oregon, he landed back at his alma mater at Miami. Over four seasons, he has compiled a 34-18 record, with a first-ever CFP bid in 2025. Oregon, meanwhile, hired Dan Lanning to replace him. Lanning has gone 48-7 over four seasons, including back-to-back CFP berths. He is 96-78 overall as a head coach.\n\nMORE: What to know about Dan Lanning's wife's cancer diagnosis",

    "description": "Liverpool spent big on flashy signings in the summer but cannot compete with the strength and depth of Arsenal’s bench",
    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta first turned to Myles Lewis-Skelly. Then he went to a double bill of Gabriels, with both Jesus and Martinelli. Next came Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze.\n\nThere were five substitutions before Liverpool’s first. Even that was enforced. Injury time proved a sadly accurate term as Conor Bradley was stretchered off and Joe Gomez came on.\n\nArsenal 0-0 Liverpool finished 5-1 in one respect: changes. “I think there are other things to talk about where both teams are at the moment than talking about the bench,” countered Arne Slot. The league table shows a 14-point gap and Slot cited a 20-goal difference in their respective set-piece balances, to borrow his term.\n\nBut champions and their probable successors have pursued different policies in their attempts to win the title. Liverpool were famously the biggest spenders, but Arsenal had the largest net spend. Slot got the flashiest signings. Arteta did not. Indeed, the last pair he brought on, Madueke and Eze, were summer arrivals but do not seem to figure in his first-choice side.\n\nHe filled out his squad, filled in every gap. It was the Polyfilla approach to winning the title, ensuring there were no cracks left in the group.\n\nThere was a case, reduced by their autumnal struggles and stumbles, to say that Liverpool had the strongest starting 11. It remains utterly uncontroversial to say that Arsenal have the best squad. No one else has quality in such depth. Arsenal, Slot had said the day before the stalemate at the Emirates, were a team with no obvious weaknesses. “The complete package,” he called them. Liverpool remain an incomplete package.\n\n“We showed that in the big games we are able to compete with any other team,” Slot argued; but Arsenal have competed with every team. Liverpool had their £450m refit but ended with a smaller squad than Arsenal and with at least three players, in Federico Chiesa, Rio Ngumoha and Wataru Endo, who Slot is reluctant to start in the Premier League.\n\nSlot fielded no striker at Arsenal, with Chiesa left unused. He has been down to two centre-backs for parts of the campaign, with Giovanni Leoni’s campaign curtailed and Gomez unfit at times. There have been times when he was without a specialist right-back. Recently, he had no out-and-out winger, Chiesa and Ngumoha apart. Liverpool did not follow Arteta’s model of two players for every position; sometimes they have not even had one.\n\nThey have been left with an overworked core. Apart from the Carabao Cup, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate have started every game this season. Apart from a one-game ban, Dominik Szoboszlai has only missed seven minutes. It has been just as well; even with them, Liverpool have felt short of players.\n\nMeanwhile, the sense that Arteta is prepared for every eventuality is underlined by the versatility of his players. None of Slot’s full-backs is particularly equipped to stand in as a centre-back. Three of Arteta’s, in Riccardo Calafiori, Jurrien Timber and Ben White, have spent part of their careers there. He has a midfielder, in Mikel Merino, who has flourished as a stand-in striker. The Spaniard scored home and away against Liverpool last season. He did not even make it off the bench on Thursday.\n\nThose options can justify Arteta’s policy of splitting his budget more ways, of signing four players each for £50m rather than bringing in two £100m men; one of Liverpool’s, in Alexander Isak, is injured and has been ineffective anyway.\n\nIt is no secret Arteta admired the Swede. He instead bought the cheaper, and distinctly limited Viktor Gyokeres. The theory was that he would be the final piece in the jigsaw; instead of winning the league because of the Swede, they may do so in spite of him. There are reasons to wonder if Gyokeres will soon be Arsenal’s fourth-choice centre-forward, even if, on form this season, Isak should be Liverpool’s second option, behind Hugo Ekitike, when each is fit.\n\nIn trying to build a title-winning side, Liverpool may have aimed for the highest ceiling, but Arsenal had the platform of the highest floor. Liverpool’s vision of a glorious attacking force, with Florian Wirtz as the creator in chief and Isak the scorer extraordinaire, may one day be realised; but even if so, it will not bring them Premier League glory this season.\n\nArsenal may have a more prosaic brand, a style that – with apologies to artists such as Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka – is based on efficiency. It has not brought much of a reward in two games against Liverpool; over 21 in a campaign, however, it has given them a six-point lead, and 14 ahead of Liverpool.\n\nAnd over a season, Arteta’s decision to prioritise strength in depth is justified by other markers. They top the second-half table, with most goals. They have 10 goal involvements from substitutes. They are alone among England’s Champions League representatives in going unbeaten in the Premier League games immediately after a European midweek.\n\nLiverpool could hold them over 90 minutes. Yet a glimpse at the benches, a sight of Freddie Woodman, Calvin Ramsay, Trey Nyoni and Ngumoha and the nine pedigree players Arteta had in reserve told a tale of where the title could be decided.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City turn to the FA Cup this weekend hoping the competition can provide a release from a frustrating run that has slowed their Premier League momentum.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side host League One opposition Exeter City knowing that domestic cup success may take on added importance given recent league results.\n\nCity arrive in the third round without a win in three matches, having been held to consecutive draws that have stalled their pursuit of high-flying Arsenal at the top of the table.\n\nThose dropped points have not damaged their position irreparably, but they have narrowed the margin for error in a title race that is beginning to stretch.\n\nThe FA Cup therefore offers both an opportunity and a warning, with progress expected but complacency punished ruthlessly in this competition.\n\nCity have been here before, using early-round ties to restore rhythm and confidence when league form has wavered.\n\nGuardiola will expect a sharp response after a sequence of performances that have promised control without delivering the decisive edge.\n\nInjuries and missed chances have played their part, but the feeling persists that City need a result to reset their season.\n\nThis fixture provides the clearest possible platform to do so, even if the opposition arrive with nothing to lose.\n\nExeter City travel to the Etihad as clear underdogs, backed by a sold-out away end and the familiar belief that the FA Cup can rewrite logic.\n\nThe League One side have lifted themselves away from immediate danger in recent weeks and arrive in improved spirits.\n\nTheir journey to this stage has been built on discipline and efficiency, qualities that will be tested relentlessly against elite opposition.\n\nExeter will know that surviving the opening phase would already represent progress, both on the pitch and in belief.\n\nGuardiola’s teams have traditionally treated the FA Cup seriously, reaching the latter stages with remarkable consistency.\n\nHowever, recent finals have ended in disappointment, sharpening the desire to go deeper this time around.\n\nWith other competitions demanding attention later in the month, City will want a professional performance that avoids drama.\n\nRotation is likely, but the expectation of control will remain non-negotiable.\n\nThe gap in resources and quality is vast, yet history offers enough reminders to prevent any sense of entitlement.\n\nEarly goals would settle nerves and allow City to impose structure and tempo.\n\nFailure to do so would invite anxiety and give Exeter a foothold they will gladly exploit.\n\nFor the visitors, the occasion alone is a reward, but the ambition will extend beyond participation.\n\nFor City, this is about restoring authority.\n\nIf they are to keep their season on track, it starts with treating this tie as more than a formality.",

    "fullText": "We know the New England Patriots will host the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC wild-card round, but who would be their next opponent if they earn a victory on Sunday night?\n\nWell, it’s pretty straightforward. First, let’s look at the current AFC playoff bracket.\n\nWild-Card Games\n(5) Houston Texans at (4) Pittsburgh Steelers\n(6) Buffalo Bills at (3) Jacksonville Jaguars\n(7) Los Angeles Chargers at (2) New England Patriots\n\nThe Jaguars, Texans and Steelers are New England’s only potential opponents in the divisional round.\n\nThe top-seeded Broncos, who won’t play this weekend, will host the lowest remaining seed in the next round. So, if the Patriots beat the seventh-seeded Chargers and the sixth-seeded Bills beat the third-seeded Jaguars, Buffalo will head to Denver for a divisional-round matchup. New England then would host the winner of the Texans-Steelers matchup.\n\nHowever, if the Jaguars beat the Bills, Jacksonville will visit New England in the divisional round, leaving the Broncos with either the Steelers or Texans.\n\nThe good news for the Patriots is that they wouldn’t have to deal with the Bills until the AFC Championship Game. And, if the goal is to avoid traveling to Denver for the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots should feel relatively confident that the Bills could upset the Broncos in the second round if they make it that far.\n\nHowever, the Jaguars and Texans are both dangerous, well-rounded opponents with strong defenses and capable offenses. The Steelers are considered the weak link in the AFC playoff field, but they beat the Patriots earlier this season and still have Aaron Rodgers at quarterback. Regardless, these are the playoffs, and nothing will be easy.\n\nThe Patriots and Chargers are scheduled to kick off from Gillette Stadium at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nMic’d-Up Mike Vrabel Trolls Stefon Diggs, Tells Patriots Star To ‘Shut The (Bleep) Up’",

So I'll support him to do that.\"\n\nDespite reports of negotiations with Celtic, Davies said: \"We've had no discussions at the moment about anything other than Kyogo giving his best and doing his best for Birmingham City.\n\n\"Personally, I think he's going to stay here and potentially battle through whatever comes in front of him.\"\n\nKyogo, who scored 85 goals in 165 appearances for Celtic, started the 3-0 defeat by Watford but was back to coming off the bench for the 3-2 defeat of leaders Coventry City at the weekend.\n\n\"Kyogo cannot be doing any \n\n\"Again though, like a lot of things, we'll obviously see as things progress through January where everyone is and make sure everyone is on the same page.\n\n\"But, certainly at this moment in time, Kyogo is an important player in the squad and will continue to be so.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Arsenal 0-0 Liverpool: Gabriel Martinelli’s moment of madness overshadowed another abject display from Gyokeres, whose form is becoming a problem for Arteta",
    "fullText": "Arsenal wanted a statement, but there won’t be much more said about this 0-0 draw with Liverpool at all – outside the controversy surrounding Gabriel Martinelli’s shameful moment. It was perhaps surprising that Arne Slot’s players didn’t respond with even greater fury after he pushed a clearly injured Conor Bradley off the pitch.\n\nIt was otherwise very much like the game in August, except without a moment of magic to settle it, or pretty much any creativity at all.\n\nAn otherwise great Christmas for Arsenal still ends up feeling, well, like a rainy midweek evening in January. The entire occasion involved a certain restlessness, but the home crowd can at least remind themselves that they are in a better position than they were a month ago, and a commanding six points clear.\n\nIt was just that Mikel Arteta’s side were too willing to cede control, in a game that will at least offer Slot some solace.\n\nThis was a third successive draw, but one that wasn’t like the others.\n\nIf Arsenal are to end up winning the title, they will have done so without actually beating last season’s champions in the league. Liverpool have claimed four points against them, out of two matches where the best you can say is that both showed each other an awful lot of respect. That’s despite constant murmurs that they don’t really like each other too much.\n\nPerhaps that was seen in Martinelli’s stunning intervention, but there’s absolutely no excuse for that. That could be one moment from this match that provokes further discussion – and a lot of controversy – but Slot did take the temperature out of it by almost speaking on the Brazilian’s behalf. The Liverpool manager said that time-wasting is a general problem in football and it should be understood that frustrated players might feel that every incident is such in the heat of the moment – even if this obviously wasn't.\n\n“You cannot expect Martinelli to think so clear in the 94th minute,” Slot said.\n\nLiverpool did enough to remind the world of their quality without actually showing it, while Arsenal weren’t allowed to play their game. Liverpool had most of the possession in the second half.\n\nUltimately, though, very little actually happened in a match from which everyone expected so much.\n\nAnd, for want of an actual discussion, it’s impossible not to say that more was by now expected of Viktor Gyokeres. It is a talking point.\n\nArsenal may still be in firm control of their destiny, but one of the lingering doubts is over the forward line, and what Arteta actually ends up deciding to do there.\n\nHow long will he keep faith with Gyokeres?\n\nThe recovering Gabriel Jesus is already a ball of energy any time he comes on, something that stands out all the more when it’s put in immediate contrast with the Swede’s relative sluggishness. Kai Havertz is, meanwhile, expected back on Sunday.\n\nThere’s even an argument that midfielder Mikel Merino is a more useful option right now.\n\nIt’s hard not to think that Gyokeres will soon be on the bench, which is probably better for Arsenal than five yards behind a ball that flashes across the box.\n\nThis isn’t to immediately dismiss the player. He’s clearly still adapting to the leap that the Premier League represents, and isn’t quite up to speed.\n\nIt is very much speed that is the issue, though.\n\nThere were three big moments in the first half, where you would have expected a striker of his profile to do everything to get there.\n\nOne was a Jurrien Timber head back. One was a Saka cut back. Another was a flashed Leandro Trossard ball across the box.\n\nYet, for each, Gyokeres ended up around five yards behind play.\n\nHe ended up going off on 64 minutes after making a mere eight touches.\n\nA bit more force for even one of those chances, and it could have been nine and a goal.\n\nFor Gyokeres’ part, he did offer one fine moment with a smart reverse pass for Timber. Arsenal didn’t even have another shot until the 90th minute, either, but that wasn’t completely down to the attacking options.\n\nArteta was evidently willing his team to be much more contained.\n\nThat was despite Liverpool not having much in attack themselves, which is much more explainable.\n\nThree of their attacking stars are out, and they ended up playing a forward up front who has occasionally filled in at left wing-back.\n\nLiverpool did begin to get control of the game in the second half, but couldn’t do much with it.\n\nThey didn’t have the individual creativity or the collective integration.\n\nFlorian Wirtz was often left looking frustrated near the area as another Liverpool attack went nowhere, and certainly not towards him.\n\nThis is maybe the greater concern for Slot. His team aren’t really building. They’re now too dependent on individual inspiration.\n\nThe difference in what Liverpool were and are could be seen in one set piece, albeit not from Arsenal. Back in August, Dominik Szoboszlai struck a 30-yard free-kick that flew into the top corner. Here, it flew into the crowd.\n\nWayward, indulged and not looking like anything it was expected to be: a bit like the team right now.\n\nHe did get closer with one that was nearer to the goal. Like so much in this match, though, it did not ultimately end with a shot on target.\n\nArsenal couldn’t even do that with one of their late set pieces, with the final whistle going just after Gabriel headed down and wide.",

    "fullText": "How Josh Allen became eternal hope for the Buffalo Bills as playoffs begin originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJosh Allen is the kind of football player who makes you believe. Shoot, Josh Allen is the kind of human being who makes you believe.\n\nAnd maybe that's because the Buffalo Bills' superstar quarterback, the reigning MVP of the National Football League, has spent a whole lifetime making people believe.\n\nIt's a crucial trait for any QB, especially one about to try and lead the Bills on a road-centric journey toward the Super Bowl.\n\nBut because of who Allen is, and where he's come from, and what he's done, there isn't a single member of Bills Mafia who doubts for a second what number 17 is capable of.\n\nMORE: Steelers' DK Metcalf, back from suspension, is a monster in the playoffs\n\nThis is a guy who had no Division I scholarship offers out of Firebaugh High School in California.\n\nSo he headed to Reedley Community College, to make believers.\n\nIt wasn't easy work. Allen had to send hundreds of emails to Division I colleges to get interest beyond the JuCo level.\n\nWyoming gave him a shot, only after their preferred recruit, Eric Dungey, flipped to Syracuse.\n\nSo there Allen went to Laramie, to make more believers.\n\nEven there, with some of the most impressive highlights you'll ever see, it wasn't easy work.\n\nNFL teams really saw this and were like “yup, that’s the 3rd best QB in this draft”\n\npic.twitter.com/Q94NUgSUIt\n\n— Polymarket Football (@PolymarketBlitz) January 1, 2026\n\nDoubters pointed to Allen's interceptions and his completion percentage as bad signs.\n\nAllen ended up being the third quarterback off the board, behind Baker Mayfield (1) and Sam Darnold (3) but ahead of Rosen (10) and Lamar Jackson (32).\n\nAnd so then it was off to Western New York, to make believers one more time.\n\nThe thing about the Allen experience, of course, is that at each stop, you can be darn sure he has made those believers.\n\nThe people in the room with Allen? They buy in. They know who he is, and what he can do. In Firebaugh, believers. At Reedley CC, believers. At Wyoming, believers.\n\nIt's the outsiders that can take some convincing.\n\nOnce in Buffalo, though, he again evangelized.

The Ducks do have an \"unclaimed\" national championship from 2024 because two NCAA selectors chose them as champions despite a College Football Playoff quarterfinal loss to Ohio State, but they don't recognize the title.\n\nIn reality, the closest Oregon has come to a national championship was 2010 and 2014. The Ducks reached the BCS title game under coach Chip Kelly in 2010, but they lost narrowly to Cam Newton and Auburn on the big stage.\n\nFour years later, Oregon entered the inaugural College Football Playoff as the No. 2 seed and played for a national championship after defeating reigning champion Florida State in the Rose Bowl. Despite entering as moderate favorites over No. 4 Ohio State, the Ducks suffered a 42-20 loss and missed their chance to finish Marcus Mariota's Heisman-winning season with the program's first national championship.\n\nOregon has reached the College Football Playoff three times. The Ducks made the first-ever playoff in 2014 but couldn't crack the final nine editions of the four-team bracket.

Cignetti helped produce one of the biggest turnarounds in college football history, taking a team that was considered an afterthought to national championship contenders.\n\nBefore Cignetti and the NIL world helped get Indiana to the top of the college football world, the Hoosiers had their issues simply breaking through in the Big Ten.

In fact, Indiana has only won the Big Ten three times in its history, most recently during the 2025 season.\n\nTherefore, Indiana's resurgence under Curt Cignetti is pretty remarkable considering Indiana's history. The Hoosiers only have two double-digit win seasons, both coming under Cignetti in 2024 and 2025, and the program only has four seasons with at least nine wins.\n\nIndiana has never won a national championship, and the Hoosiers have never really been close to winning one either. Previously, the best finishes for Indiana were a loss in the 1967 Rose Bowl and a loss in the first round of the 2024 College Football Playoff.\n\nIf the Hoosiers win the National Championship in 2026, it will be the first time since 1996 that the national champion is a first-time victory. That year, Florida won its first title under Steve Spurrier.\n\nThe Hoosiers have made the College Football Playoff twice in their history, and they came in back-to-back seasons. First, Indiana made it's CFP debut in 2024 as an at-large team, then the Hoosiers returned to the Playoff in 2025 as the Big Ten champion and the top seed in the entire tournament.\n\nThe 2024 Indiana team was Cignetti's first in Bloomington, and featured many players who were also on the 2025 team.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana has always been known as a basketball school. Whether it's legendary coach Bob Knight, or the historic greats such as Larry Bird and Isiah Thomas. Basketball is what instantly comes to mind when people think of Indiana sports.\n\nHowever, the Curt Cignetti era is here for their football program. The man himself said it best, \"It's pretty simple, I win. Google me.\"\n\nWith Indiana football off to this successful start with Cignetti, there are plenty of eyeballs on the university.\n\nFans are familiar with the bulldog, wolverine, and buckeye. But what is a Hoosier?\n\nThe Sporting News explains the origin of the nickname and how long Indiana has used it.\n\nMORE: Curt Cignetti's best quotes at Indiana\n\nWhile the exact origin has been debated for decades, the best explanation is that \"Hoosier\" refers to a native or resident of the U.S. state of Indiana.\n\nIt is one of the oldest state nicknames, dating back to the 1800s. One of the more popular uses derives from a poet named John Finley. Finley was from Richmond and wrote a poem called \"The Hoosier's Nest.\"\n\nIn this poem, the term \"Hoosher\" is used to describe the qualities of the pioneers of Indiana. These qualities include friendliness, hard work, and self-reliance.\n\nIn 1848, Berlett's Dictionary of Americanisms defined the word \"Hoosier\" as \"a nickname given at the west, to natives of Indiana.\"\n\nThen, 169 years later, in 2017, the U.S. Government Publishing Office updated its style manual (a guide for language usage and publishing), which officially recognized residents of the state of Indiana as Hoosiers.\n\nMORE: How Hoosiers went from most losses in college football history to No. 1\n\nIndiana Athletics first adopted this nickname during the 1923 football season. This team called themselves the \"Scrapping Hoosiers,\" which was meant to highlight their aggressive play style.\n\nSince that season, Indiana has used the term \"Hoosiers\" for all of its sports programs.\n\nIndiana's mascot is Hoosier the Bison. In 2025, the mascot was brought back after a nearly 60-year absence from the university.\n\nThe bison is meant to connect the university to the state mammal. It also makes a direct link to the state's heritage and a strong connection to conservation.\n\nThe mascot was used from 1965 to 1969, then was cut from the university for several decades. After a push from the athletic department, Hoosier the Bison was brought back. The new mascot returned in August 2025.\n\nMORE: Curt Cignetti's complete coaching timeline, from D2 school to Indiana",

The 27-year-old has made just five appearances since joining in the summer, scoring once, and has not featured since October 23rd.\n\nFrustrated by his lack of playing time, Romain Faivre is keen to leave Saudi Arabia this month and relaunch his career back in France. The former Stade Brestois player remains a well-regarded attacking midfielder, capable of operating across the frontline, particularly on the right wing.\n\nTalks have already begun with Bournemouth, with negotiations centred on how much of Faivre’s salary would be covered by any prospective Ligue 1 suitor. Le Havre AC, currently 13th with 18 points after 17 matches, are hoping that sporting director Mathieu Bodmer can leverage the club’s relative stability to convince the player.\n\nThey face competition from AJ Auxerre, who sit 17th on 12 points, and bottom side FC Metz, also on 12 points.

I have a high regard for Pisilli. Perhaps, as with all young players, it would be better to play more. If someone can do that at Roma, that’s fine, but right now there’s no room,” Gasperini said of Pisilli on the eve of the match against Genoa.\n\nThe situation now, however, is different: the Moroccan is out, Manu Koné’s performances are declining because he has no replacements, and even Cristante, who will be suspended against Sassuolo, has had little or no rest this season.\n\nSeveral teams are ready to embrace Pisilli, most notably Daniele De Rossi’s Genoa, who would like to bring him back after his coaching stint at Roma, but in one of his latest outings, Gasperini himself has locked him down: “There are few alternatives, and his departure in January is unlikely.”\n\nAfter his performance against Lecce, Pisilli stated: “I haven’t played much, but I’ve grown by playing against top-level players.” These words reveal a certain maturity despite his young age.\n\nMore than ever, his destiny is in his hands, or rather, in his feet, and it’s not out of the question that, even with the return of El Aynaoui, Gasp might decide not to let go of the U21 international.\n\nDiscussions about a possible transfer have certainly been postponed until the end of January, and around Trigoria, his talent is not up for discussion: only a loan deal is possible.",

    "description": "Quantum computing has long promised transformative advances in data analysis, yet practical quantum machine learning has remained elusive due to fundamental obstacles such as a steep quantum cost for the loading of classical data and poor trainability of many quantum machine learning algorithms designed for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor.",

    "description": "Key learnings from building Baselime",
    "fullText": "I started Baselime, an observability startup, in October 2021. 2.5 years later we joined Cloudflare. I was a first-time solo founder and I made more mistakes than I could count.\n\nIn this post, I’m reflecting on my time leading Baselime. I believe it will resonate with technical founders currently building or considering building similar companies. It focuses on early-stage, pre- Product Market Fit (PMF) developer tooling or infrastructure startups. I’ll refrain from typical advice such as “build a strong team”, or “build something people want”, smarter people already wrote about this extensively.\n\nYour one and only mission as an early-stage founder is to find Product Market Fit as quickly as possible. Nothing else matters.\n\nIt’s extremely easy to focus on software architecture, clean code, tests, scalability, refactoring, etc.\n\nI can hear you thinking that your startup is different and you need scalability from day 1. You’re wrong. Your solution will evolve. Obviously, it’s easier to evolve if the foundations are solid, but that’s assuming the solid foundations you’re building are for the right thing. Your early thesis about the world is most likely incorrect and you’ll have to adjust.\n\nI spent too much time building the foundations for “Observability as Code”. Imagine the best parts of CloudFormation and Terraform for observability: a CLI and a state management backend. Developers write multiple YAML files (with variables, interpolation, templates, etc.), the CLI combines them into a giant JSON file, uploads it to the backend which decides which resources (alerts, queries, dashboards, etc.) to create, edit or delete and the order of those operations.\n\nDespite all the hours spent building, refining and improving this, nobody cared. I was more concerned about building an elegant solution than actually finding PMF. Don’t do this.\n\nInstead, iterate fast, measure the result of your experiments, and if something doesn’t work, throw it away and move on quickly. When you find what works, you’ll refactor and improve.\n\nIt’s common startup wisdom that your solution should be better, faster, cheaper than the competition. Whilst there’s truth in this statement, in 2024 this is not enough anymore. Incumbents in the developer tools space iterate fast, and there are 5 new startups going after your market every quarter.\n\nInstead, look for technological shifts and focus your efforts where you’re a monopoly, rather than competing.\n\nI started Baselime with a focus on observability for AWS Lambda. There was a consensus among our early users that Baselime was better, faster and cheaper than the competition. But this wasn’t enough to stand out in a crowded space.\n\nUntil I noticed a massive segment where we could be a monopoly: the new developer platforms such as Cloudflare, Vercel, Fly.io, Koyeb, Render, etc.\n\nWithin 1 week, we built a Vercel integration and instantly doubled our weekly active users. Likewise for our Cloudflare integration.\n\nIf something is not growing fast, drop it quickly and work on something else. There are no points for stubbornness, you’re in a race against running out of money before PMF.\n\nIn April 2023, I spoke with the Cloudflare team about observability on the Workers platform, but we built our Cloudflare integration only 6 months later. It actually took only 1 week to build it.\n\nWhy wait 6 months to build something so obvious? 6 months is an eternity for an early-stage startup.\n\nDuring this time, I pretended to “focus on a single problem” to justify being stubborn on becoming the best observability platform for AWS Lambda. I ignored all market signals, both from developers and market research, telling me to shift my focus to an adjacent problem. Don’t do this.\n\nWe’re developers, we want to automate everything. But sometimes you’ve got to roll up your sleeves and do the tedious, unsexy but necessary work to grow.\n\nWe built sales automation and lead generation pipelines, but nothing worked. Our user growth was flat. Until I decided to ignore all the best practices and do what works for me, something I’ll actually enjoy: personally message every developer with a slight interest in cloud computing I could find on Twitter. It was unglamorous, tedious, and monotonous, but it had to be done. This directly translated to signups, sales and referrals.\n\nI should have done this months earlier.\n\nIf you build it, they won’t come. You must create hype around your product. Technical founders tend to view hype as a bad thing, used to sell snake oil.\n\nWhen in fact, hype is a cheat code to get in the public awareness. Get developers to know your solution exists, its benefits and its limitations. It doesn’t matter if they don’t Eventually (hopefully in the near future) they, or someone they know, will need to solve your problem and your solution should be the first they consider. Hype will get you there faster.\n\nyou thought we were done?\n\ndistributed tracing for @CloudflareDev with multi-cloud support \n\n- automatic correlation between logs and traces\n- support for workers, kv, durable objects, queues\n- all powered by the @baselimehq query engine\n\nand this design 😍✨\n\nmy dms are open if… pic.twitter.com/KcLZSr4DQP\n\nI love building software. It’s my main hobby. But building Baselime meant I didn’t have a hobby anymore. I didn’t have space to do this thing I love without the pressure of solving a problem for developers.\n\nI kept shipping every day, but there are days I actually despised building software, I didn’t want to build software but I had to.\n\nGet a side project, where you can explore and build whatever random useless thing you want. Your overall happiness levels will thank you - building a startup is hard enough, don’t go through it without hobbies :)\n\nIf you thought starting a company is hard, try selling one.\n\nBaselime was a pretty simple business when we joined Cloudflare. Just a few employees and our main assets were our IP. However, it still took quite a bit of work, from the negotiations phase to all the accounting and legal work involved.\n\nThe most difficult part was how nerve wracking it all was. I was a solo-founder and until Baselime, the most complex contracts I ever signed were tenancy agreements.\n\nAfter 2 years of building and selling, Baselime was part of my identity. The reality of joining a larger organisation was challenging. Thankfully a few trusted advisors truly supported me throughout the process. Joining Cloudflare was the best decision to achieve our vision: enabling every developer to resolve issues before they become problems.\n\nThe Baselime journey taught me much more than these highlights. I’m always keen to connect with dev tool founders and aspiring founders. Hit me up, my dms are open :)",

    "fullText": "A significant chunk of Chinese copper demand has all but evaporated after the metal’s stunning surge to record levels.\n\nCopper on the London Metal Exchange burst through $13,000 a ton for the first time this week, extending its rally to nearly 50% over the past year. A cocktail of bullish factors could drive prices even higher over the short term. While real-world buyers typically take time to adjust to such sharp increases, what’s notable in this case is the extent to which industrial users in the biggest market are scaling back purchases.\n\nNYC Fights Sale of Bankrupt Rentals After Mamdani Blasts Living Conditions\n\nNew Design Plans Revealed for White House Ballroom\n\nWe Still Don’t Know if Robotaxis Are Safer Than Human Drivers\n\nNew LA Home Designs, Reimagined By Fire\n\nSlowing the Spread of Urban Fires Starts Right Outside the Home\n\n“It is surprising how much price rejection is taking place. The Chinese are just not buying copper, it’s true,” Kostas Bintas, head of metals at trading giant Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., said in an interview. “But it’s finite — at some point you need to buy.”\n\nSluggish physical demand contrasts with the speculative frenzy lifting futures markets, where deep-pocketed funds are responding to tighter global supply, favorable interest rates and an impulse to hedge geopolitical turmoil by stockpiling commodities. The copper contract in Shanghai, which accounts for import costs, topped 100,000 yuan a ton ($14,300) for the first time at the end of December.\n\nChinese industry, though, accounts for half of global copper demand. The fabricators that shape the metal — into wires, sheets and pipes for power cables, circuit boards and plumbing systems — are struggling to pass on their higher costs to factories. As inventories build, the smelters that refine copper in the first instance are trying to export their surplus.\n\nRecord copper prices “had a significant impact in December,” said Hai Jianxun, a sales executive at Henan Yuxing Copper Co. in central China, which makes pipes for items like air-conditioners. “The overall market was very quiet — much quieter than in previous years.”\n\nA Mysteel Global survey covering most suppliers showed that about 60% of the firms making copper rod for electricity transmission, a category that accounts for around half of China’s copper goods, cut or shut production over the month because of mounting costs.\n\nFees to process refined copper into rod fell to zero this week, Mysteel said, the lowest-ever level for the time of the year.\n\nThe subdued activity isn’t an anomaly. Even during the autumn, when demand typically peaks, operating rates across fabricators were at multiyear lows for the season. Ultimately, the market is paying the price of the economy’s lackluster recovery from the pandemic and structurally weaker growth.",

    "fullText": "Shares in Greenland-focused miner Amaroq Minerals surged after its chief executive told CNBC the company has held talks with US government bodies about potential investment opportunities.\n\nCanada-based Amaroq's stock price on the TSX Venture Exchange closed 19.2% higher at 2.30 Canadian dollars, or $1.66, apiece on Thursday.\n\nDeals could involve \"offtake agreements, infrastructure support and credit lines,\" Amaroq CEO Eldur Ólafsson told CNBC on Thursday.\n\nÓlafsson told the network that American investor interest in the company has increased alongside renewed political attention on Greenland.\n\nThat attention has been sharpened by President Donald Trump's renewed focus on the Arctic island, which he raised during his first term in office.\n\nGreenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, has grown in strategic importance as melting Arctic ice opens new shipping routes and intensifies competition among the US, Russia, and China.\n\nTrump has argued that Denmark is not doing enough to safeguard Greenland's strategic value.\n\n\"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking in a separate Bloomberg TV interview, Ólafsson said renewed US political focus on Greenland has already translated into increased interest from American investors.\n\nAmaroq employs around 300 people and has raised more than $300 million over the past decade, Ólafsson said.\n\nThe company operates the Nalunaq gold mine in southern Greenland and holds exploration licences focused on copper and rare earths. The company is advancing projects involving germanium and gallium, metals used in semiconductors, defense systems, and advanced electronics.\n\nÓlafsson told Bloomberg he understands Trump's interest in Greenland, but added that people on the ground \"don't like the rhetoric or the language.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said the heightened attention has opened opportunities for investment in a region where infrastructure and logistics remain major challenges.\n\n\"It's really important that the Nordics and the US work together with Greenland. In the end, Greenland makes the decision. We are a Greenland-focused company and work in its interests, but these interests need to align for things to work,\" he told Bloomberg.",

    "title": "The military is running out of teenagers to recruit — and old-school methods to reach them are failing",
    "description": "The military faces a new recruiting crisis as America's teen population shrinks and outreach methods fail. The Pentagon is rethinking its playbook.",
    "fullText": "Military recruiting is on the upswing, but many recruiters say it's never been harder to get young people interested in service.\n\nPhone lists of numbers that once rang a family landline now dead-end at parents' cellphones. School access can vary from one street to the next. And while a direct message might be the fastest way to reach an overly online 17-year-old, finding the right social media handle can feel like chasing ghosts. The hunt has become so grueling that the time it takes to meet quotas of up to two recruits a month is pushing some recruiters into burnout territory.\n\nThese are some of the frustrations Business Insider heard while speaking to nearly four dozen Marine recruiters, leaders, and other officials for a four-part series on recruiter welfare.\n\nThe hunt for solutions is on, and legislation and use of artificial intelligence could be on the horizon.\n\nThe Pentagon is facing steep declines in young Americans' propensity and fitness to serve and public confidence in the military, long one of the government's most-trusted institutions, according to public polling.\n\nBoosting young Americans' interest in service, and reaching them in the first place, will require more than traditional military recruiting efforts, those involved agree. Political momentum for broader measures is already building.\n\nProject 2025, the conservative policy blueprint, outlines a major expansion of recruiting in schools: increased access for recruiters, more Junior ROTC programs, and a requirement that federally funded schools administer the military entrance exam. An effort to provide recruiters with improved access to high schools was included in the national defense spending bill signed into law in December.\n\nThe office of the defense secretary, which did not respond to a request for comment, recently established a new Recruitment Task Force. The Corps' Recruiting Command, which is part of the task force, is seeking legislative changes to help \"improve the student data collected in support of recruiting,\" a Marine spokesman told Business Insider.\n\nExperts are pressing for urgent solutions as population shifts reduce pools of young people eligible for the military.\n\n\"The coming declining birth rate challenge is so pronounced, even if the services were doing everything right to get to our current requirements, the math is just going to change,\" said Kate Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security and author of a recent report on recruiting.\n\nOver the next 16 years, the total number of children turning 18 is expected to fall by 700,000, representing a 13% drop, according to Kuzminski's research.\n\n\"Recruiters' jobs are going to be made a lot more difficult by this generational decline,\" Kuzminski said. Soon, they'll be forced to contend with capturing a larger percentage of American youth than ever before to meet the same end-strength requirements.\n\nAs recruiting pools narrow, the Army and Navy have found a way to turn otherwise unqualified young people into fit recruits, with new pre-boot camp preparatory courses to help applicants raise test scores or lose weight to meet military fitness standards.\n\nThe approach has helped dramatically boost enlistments. But the effort has drawn scrutiny over whether those services are accepting too many low-scoring applicants.\n\n\"The things that have worked up until now are not going to work in the future,\" Kuzminski said of recruiting.\n\nFor now, Marines still find new recruits by canvassing malls, attending community events, visiting schools, messaging social media accounts, and making dozens of phone calls that often reach a parent who isn't thrilled about the idea of their child joining the military.\n\nHigh schools that receive federal funding are legally required to allow recruiters access to grounds for pitches to classrooms or career fairs. But several recruiters said access isn't uniformly offered, and can hinge on the relationships recruiters foster with educators.\n\nA Marine recruiting official said geography can play a role and that some areas in the Northeast are known for more regularly keeping out recruiters.\n\nMore than half a dozen recruiters said conservative or rural areas aren't necessarily more welcoming, either. In their view, new enlistees are rarely motivated by politics; they're drawn by purpose, belonging, and the promise of financial stability.\n\nEven in places where \"support the troops\" is a common refrain, recruiters said, many parents resist the idea of their children joining the military.\n\nAnother factor: With fewer Americans personally connected to the armed forces, interest in enlisting has waned. A dwindling veteran population means fewer role models to inspire the next generation, and after two decades of the Global War on Terror, some veterans discourage their own children from serving.\n\nRecruiters say this reflects a growing divide between the military and civilian America — and a misunderstanding of what daily military life can entail — not just heroic Navy SEALs, or Top Gun pilots, but also equipment maintenance, human resources management, and mundane planning for those holding senior ranks.\n\nThe result of this divide, recruiters said, isn't just apathy. Three recruiters told Business Insider they've had guns pulled on them when visiting homes. One, who remains on active duty, recalled being called a \"baby killer\" and a \"slave\" to the government by an irate parent.\n\nAs phone lists falter and school access remains inconsistent — problems compounded by falling US birth rates and shrinking pools of potential recruits — recruiters are trying to meet teens where they already are: online. Social media has become a routine part of the job; artificial intelligence, meanwhile, is only beginning to surface as a potential tool.\n\nMany recruiters already use social media to connect with young people, though with varying results. Earlier this year, the Army tried partnering with influencers already in uniform to pique interest in enlistment, an effort that was halted after running into legal hurdles.\n\nWhen it comes to contacting prospective recruits through social media, some recruiters say it can feel inappropriate, acutely aware of past misconduct cases and wary of how easily online interactions can blur boundaries.\n\nAt the same time, the military's ties with Big Tech are deepening and opening new doors. A handful of leaders from Silicon Valley, including executives from Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI, were commissioned into the US Army Reserve earlier this year. It's part of a larger Army transformation effort to prepare the service for future conflicts, which some defense experts have said will require help from Silicon Valley.\n\nIn building the manpower for the future fight, leaning on emerging technology and, particularly, artificial intelligence could help recruiters identify and contact young people who may be predisposed to service, such as athletes, gamers, or those interested in science, technology, engineering, and math fields, said retired Marine Col. Bill Gray, who led recruiting efforts across the Southeast from 2018 to 2021.\n\nRecruiting has long been one of the military's toughest jobs, and when it tanks, Gray said, the answer has long been to expect recruiters to work harder, an idea that he said feels out of date with emerging technologies.\n\nOne fix, he said, could be giving recruiters access to contact information that's publicly available but not easily accessible. He recalled once watching recruiters flip through physical copies of high school yearbooks to zero in on star athletes and other standout students, a time-suck.\n\n\"It's mind-boggling to me that we are even having this conversation because of the time that could be saved,\" he said. \"You could be processing at machine speed instead of one-human speed.\"\n\nWithout a draft, increased face time with prospective recruits would be critical if the nation were to enter a large-scale war, said one senior Marine official familiar with recruiting demands who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile AI tools have the potential to make connecting with recruits easier, the official said that effort could run up against federal laws restricting the military's ability to collect or analyze data about US citizens.\n\n\"We are recruiting children,\" the official said. \"It's good that it's hard for our recruiters to find children who want to join. It should not be easy.\"\n\n\"There's a reluctance to go down some of these paths,\" Gray, the retired colonel, said. \"People say, 'Well, we're making mission, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Some recruiters say the system is breaking them — putting them under stress and threatening to derail their military careers.\n\n\"You could make life so much easier for those guys and gals,\" Gray said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The House passed a bipartisan package of three spending bills on Thursday that would fund parts of the federal government through September, demonstrating the eagerness of lawmakers to avoid another government shutdown near the end of the month.\n\nCongress has so far passed only three of the 12 annual spending bills that fund federal agencies for the current fiscal year. Failure to pass the remainder before a Jan. 30th deadline risks another shutdown just weeks after the record-setting, 43-day shutdown that occurred late last year.\n\nLeaders from both parties endorsed the latest measure, signaling that passage is likely in the Senate as well, belatedly getting Congress halfway home in completing their work on this year's spending bills. The White House also has endorsed the measure, calling it a “fiscally responsible bill.”\n\nThe package covers such agencies as the Interior Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Departments of Commerce and Justice. It passed by an overwhelming vote of 397-28, an unusual display of unity when it comes to government spending.\n\nThe price tag of the bills, which Republicans put at roughly $175 billion, comes in below current levels, generating savings for taxpayers, GOP lawmakers said. Democrats countered that they were able to negotiate spending levels far above what the Trump administration had requested and removed scores of policy riders that they say would have weakened gun safety regulations, expanded oil and gas leasing on federal lands and took aim at LGBTQ and racial equity policies.\n\nImportantly, Democrats said, the measure also includes legally binding spending requirements that restrain the White House's ability to withhold or delay funds for programs Trump opposes. Trump's first year in office was met with scores of lawsuits from states, cities and nonprofits who accused the administration of undertaking unlawful power grabs.\n\n“This legislation is a forceful rejection of draconian cuts to public services proposed by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe Senate would also have to pass the measure before President Donald Trump could sign it into law. But the bill has bipartisan backing in that chamber, too.\n\n“Republicans are strongest when we stay focused, Democrats are more effective when they negotiate in good faith, and the country is better off when Republicans and Democrats work together,” Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in urging colleagues to vote for the bill.\n\nFunding work is well behind schedule\n\nIn recent years, Congress has generally lumped all the spending bills into one or two measures, often voted on before lawmakers left Washington for the holidays. Lawmakers say such a process makes it easier to include provisions that couldn't pass muster on their own.\n\nJohnson has called for returning to a time when Congress takes up the 12 spending bills separately, though he's finding it easier said than done. The fiscal year began Oct. 1 and Congress is still debating full-year funding for most federal agencies.\n\nDemocrats listed various priorities they were able to maintain or increase funding for, despite the administration's opposition. For example, a program to make homes more energy efficient for low-income Americans got a $3 million boost, instead of being eliminated as proposed by Trump. The EPA, a frequent Trump target, gets $8.8 billion. That's more than double what Trump sought.\n\nRepublicans had voiced concerns about some earmarks in the bill, now called community funding projects. To ease those concerns, a nearly $1.5 million earmark obtained by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was removed from the bill. It would have funded a Somali-led organization's efforts to provide job training and peer support services for those struggling with addiction.\n\nRepublicans have been intensely focused on allegations of fraud by day care centers run by Somali residents. Those allegations are still being investigated. Omar has urged people not to blame an entire community for the actions of a relative few.",

    "fullText": "Some of Cursor's most important AI features didn't come from a formal road map. One was built over Thanksgiving, says its engineering head.\n\nJason Ginsberg said in an episode of the \"LangChain\" podcast published Thursday that a bottom-up approach has shaped several of Cursor's core capabilities.\n\nGinsberg said he built a debugging feature over the Thanksgiving holiday simply because he wanted it and to \"help people on the team.\" The AI-coding company has since launched its \"Debug Mode.\"\n\n\"If there's internal adoption, that's kind of our metric for this is ready to ship,\" he said.\n\nThe same pattern applies to Cursor's agent, now one of its defining features. Ginsberg said it was originally prototyped by a single engineer, as others on the team were skeptical.\n\n\"He prototyped it super quickly, and everyone's like, 'Oh wow, this works,'\" Ginsberg said.\n\nCursor still maintains short-term roadmaps, but many of its biggest features emerge organically, Ginsberg said.\n\nHe also said there isn't much formal process at Cursor. Instead of debating product changes in documents or alignment meetings, engineers resolve disagreements through code.\n\nCursor is among the most prominent AI companies being built by a tiny team.\n\nGinsberg said on the podcast that Cursor had about 20 people at the start of 2025.\n\n\"That was because the process to hiring people was very slow and the bar was extremely, extremely high,\" he said.\n\nThat talent-dense structure allows Cursor to operate with minimal organizational process and move quickly, he added.\n\nThe preference for small, elite teams has become increasingly influential across the AI industry, including at Big Tech firms traditionally known for scale.\n\nMeta's superintelligence AI unit, for example, is led by a small group of top researchers. The AI unit comprises a tiny fraction of the company's headcount of over 70,000 employees.\n\n\"I've just gotten a little bit more convinced around the ability for small, talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research,\" Mark Zuckerberg said on Meta's earnings call in July.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said last year that \"we're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon.\"\n\nBusiness Insider in May compiled a list of the highest-valued AI startups around the world with teams of 50 employees or fewer, according to PitchBook data.",

    "description": "Jennifer Aniston, 56, sticks to an 80/20 diet that leaves room for the occasional cheeseburger and fries — and Demi Moore, 63, says she still drinks Red Bull.",
    "fullText": "If there's one question celebrities over 50 never stop getting asked, it's how they stay healthy.\n\nEven interviews meant to promote a new movie, book, or company launch often veer into questions about health and diet.\n\nAfter a while, the answers start to sound familiar.\n\nFrom regular exercise to the morning routines they refuse to skip, the same six habits keep coming up.\n\nAt 100, Dick Van Dyke still hits the gym three days a week. He credits regular exercise with helping him live a long life, and while most people his age aren't exactly itching to work out, he said he can still \"move pretty well.\"\n\nHe is one of several celebrities who say age is no excuse for not being active. Helen Mirren, 80, has long been a fan of a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s — and it remains her go-to.\n\nThey also tend to stick with what works rather than constantly changing routines. Both Martha Stewart, 84, and Jane Fonda, 88, say they've been doing the same exercises for years.\n\n\"I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,\" Fonda said.\n\nMatt Damon, 55, said cutting gluten helped him slim down to 167 pounds for his latest film, a number he hadn't seen since high school.\n\nHe's not the only one who's made small but intentional changes to his diet. Alex Rodriguez, 50, has dramatically reduced how often he eats meat, and Al Roker, 71, said he's done the same.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they deprive themselves of the foods they enjoy.\n\n\"Moderation rather than deprivation is better in the long run,\" Roker said. \"If you deprive yourself of stuff that you like, eventually you're going to snap and go crazy.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston, 56, takes a similar approach, sticking to an 80/20 rule that leaves room for the foods she actually enjoys, such as a cheeseburger and fries.\n\nEven Demi Moore, 63, who sticks to a meat-free, nutrient-dense diet, can't give up her one guilty pleasure.\n\n\"I mean, I'm not perfect. I still do drink Red Bull. I do love it. But not many. One,\" Moore said.\n\nGetting older isn't something many of them seem preoccupied with. If anything, it's given them more confidence.\n\nFor Jodi Foster, turning 60 marked a turning point after she spent her 50s feeling like she couldn't compete with her younger self.\n\n\"Everything changed. I was like, 'Yeah, I don't care. I'm no longer tortured by any of this. I don't know why I seemed to care so much,'\" Foster said.\n\nSimilarly, Elizabeth Banks, 51, said she approaches aging with a positive mindset. She's happy to let age happen, rather than try to fight it. That goes for Linda Hamilton, 69, as well.\n\n\"I do not spend a moment trying to look younger on any level, ever. I have just completely surrendered to the fact that this is the face that I've earned,\" Hamilton said.\n\nFor both Nicole Kidman, 58, and Melinda French Gates, 61, aging has come with freedom from other people's opinions and a deeper respect for the experiences they've accumulated along the way.\n\n\"Like if I'm not your cup of tea, that's OK,\" French Gates said.\n\nAt this stage in life, many agree that time must be spent intentionally.\n\nKate Winslet said hitting 50 made her reevaluate her definition of success.\n\n\"Success, actually, for me more these days is more about pulling it off, being a decent person. You know, being able to take care of people, having time for friends, also learning how to be OK with not being busy all the time,\" Winslet said.\n\nShe's not the only celebrity who's said that milestone birthdays sparked similar periods of reflection.\n\nBoth Jane Fonda, 88, and Michelle Obama, 61, said that turning 60 was a pivotal moment that made them consider how they wanted to spend the rest of their lives.\n\n\"If I'm lucky, I live to 90 and that's 30 good summers,\" Obama said.\n\nFor Mary Steenburgen, 72, aging has also made her more selective about who she chooses to spend time with.\n\n\"With not wasting time on people that aren't in my life for the right reason, for being honest with myself about life,\" Steenburgen said.\n\nSlowing down also doesn't seem to be top of mind for many of them.\n\nKris Jenner, 70, has been clear she's not thinking about retirement just yet — and neither are Vera Wang, 76, nor June Squibb, 96.\n\n\"I think maybe a little bit like Warren Buffett or Queen Elizabeth II, I'm just going to keep prodding on because I feel as though I'm able to do my best work more and more,\" Wang said.\n\nSimilarly, working keeps Morgan Freeman active and helps ward off the effects of aging.\n\n\"There is a saying about old age — 'Keep moving' — and what Clint Eastwood, 95, says: 'Don't let the old man in,'\" Freeman, 88, said.\n\nWith Bill Nye, 70, staying busy extends well beyond work.\n\n\"I do crossword puzzles,\" Nye said. \"And as an engineer, I'm always designing and making little things.\"\n\nFor many, their mornings tend to be built around a few habits they don't skip.\n\nCindy Crawford, 59, said she eases into her mornings with a Bible podcast, dry brushing, and body oil — all before she even thinks about checking her phone.\n\n\"I probably heard it on a podcast, but it was like 'Think about it. What is the first input you want?'\" Crawford said.\n\nCate Blanchett, 56, said she loves a good icy plunge in the morning to \"jolt\" herself awake.\n\n\"I get up and get in. Five minutes, and it just brings everything back down. Because you have to connect with where you are,\" Blanchett said.\n\nMartha Stewart said she wakes up with the sun — literally, since she doesn't have curtains — and she never skips her morning green juice.\n\n\"If you have my green juice every day, you would just feel great all the time,\" Stewart said.",

    "description": "Ukrainian cities have set up hundreds of \"invincibility points\" in preparation for a rare mass blackout event like this week's.",
    "fullText": "A new wave of Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure has put two of its biggest regions to the test, as local cities rolled out plans for dealing with their worst blackouts in years.\n\nTheir prepared \"blackout mode\" response provides some insight into how urban centers might steel themselves for energy crises in wartime, especially during cold months. Ukraine's winter can turn brutal in January and February, when temperatures typically drop to 18°F.\n\nMass blackouts can also disrupt water and sewage systems, hospitals, public transportation, and road control, including traffic lights.\n\nBoth Ukrainian troops and civilians have long learned to cope with frequent energy shortages in the winter, maintaining backup generators, battery-powered lamps, and stockpiles of coal or gas.\n\nBut Moscow's latest attacks on Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk, two eastern Ukrainian regions, plunged both areas into almost total darkness this week.\n\nRegional leaders have described it as their biggest energy crisis since 2022, when Ukrainians first faced wartime power outages. Borys Filatov, the mayor of Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk's largest city, said the situation there was one of the most severe in the country and had risen to the level of a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"This is the first total blackout in the entire region in recent years,\" Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAs national authorities reported that over 1 million people had lost heat and water, local officials rushed to restore power and open access to facilities prearranged for the blackouts.\n\nOne of their prepared responses was to deploy \"invincibility points,\" or earmarked emergency shelters equipped with heat, communication, and basic necessities.\n\nSome local governments publish a map with available locations for civilians. The city of Dnipro, for example, maintains a list of mostly schools, municipality buildings, and metro stations designated as safe spots.\n\nCivilians are meant to visit these shelters to \"warm up, charge your gadgets, and wait out the power outage,\" per the municipal government.\n\nA video published by Oleksy Kuleba, Ukraine's vice prime minister for reconstruction and the minister for community and territorial development, showed one point in Dnipropetrovsk that appears to be located in a small convenience store.\n\nKuleba said the region's energy sector had been hit with a \"massive blow,\" and that over 5,000 people visited 500 such locations in the city of Dnipro within 24 hours after the power outages began.\n\nKuleba added that neighboring regions in Ukraine had donated 45 generators to Dnipropetrovsk, where some of its trains had switched to burning onboard fuel for power.\n\nZaporizhzhia's governor, Fedorov, also said on Thursday that the region had 400 established invincibility points, with 200 ready for visitors within two hours.\n\n\"Residents could warm up, call their relatives, drink hot tea, and, if necessary, stay overnight,\" he said.\n\nFilatov, Dnipro's mayor, said on Thursday that the city had set up 130 water dispensers, which his staff marked on Google Maps, and that disrupted public transport would be temporarily replaced by buses.\n\nHospitals were already equipped with alternative power sources and necessities, while parts of the city, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, were supported by backup power, he added.\n\n\"The city's sewage system is also powered,\" Filatov said.\n\nNotably, Filatov said that while authorities had extended local school holidays to January 11, kindergartens would operate on four-hour shifts \"because it's clear that parents are also in a difficult situation.\"\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Fedorov said the region had been left \"completely without electricity\" on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We immediately went into 'blackout' mode and started working according to a clear plan,\" he said.\n\nZaporizhzhia's hospitals similarly switched to backup power within minutes, and the region's traffic lights \"worked autonomously,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have since said that power has been partially returned to both regions, with Kuleba reporting on late Thursday evening that water and heating in Dnipropetrovsk had been restored to over 1.7 million people and 270,000 people, respectively.\n\nEnergy supplier DTEK said that around 700,000 families in the Dnipropetrovsk region once again had access to electricity, though it added that Russian bombing was continuing.\n\n\"An exhausting day for energy workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region,\" the company said.\n\nFedorov warned repeatedly on Thursday evening of incoming drone and guided missile strikes over Zaporizhzhia. He later said that Russia had carried out over 728 strikes, including drone attacks, artillery shelling, and multiple-launch rocket system strikes across Ukraine that day.\n\nBoth Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk are close to the southern and eastern front lines in Ukraine.\n\nKyiv has often accused Russia of specifically targeting energy infrastructure during the winter to exhaust and punish Ukrainian civilians, which is a war crime but is often difficult to prove.\n\nThe Kremlin has often responded that its strikes were intended for legitimate military targets, though the years have shown that critical facilities are regularly damaged or destroyed by the attacks.\n\n\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.",

    "description": "Love it or hate it, Lego's Smart Brick has elicited strong reactions from its adult fanbase as they process the analog toymaker's embrace of tech.",
    "fullText": "Small speakers hum as two \"Star Wars\"-themed Lego lightsabers clash. Lights beam from the top of a Lego-built airplane. A roaring engine sound kicks in as multiple vehicles race across the floor.\n\nIt's all part of a high-tech — and polarizing — update from Lego called Smart Play that the toymaker unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this week in Las Vegas.\n\nLego says its new line of chip-based bricks is \"one of the most significant evolutions\" since the launch of figurines in 1978.\n\nAt the center of the system is what Lego calls a Smart Brick. It's the same size as the classic two-by-four Lego piece — a design that has remained largely unchanged since the company began producing plastic bricks in the early 1930s — but it contains sensors, lights, and a tiny speaker.\n\nThe move pushes the famously analog toy deeper into the world of embedded technology. Among adult fans of Lego — known as AFOLs — the reaction has been mixed.\n\nOnline, some longtime builders and parents have voiced concern about what they see as the growing \"tech-ification\" of toys traditionally more reliant on one's imagination.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, Lego purists, toy enthusiasts, and industry watchers said they're intrigued by the technology — but some worry the added electronics will push Lego's prices even higher.\n\n\"I've loved the creativity involved without Smart Bricks,\" Jake Doll, 33, a Lego enthusiast who posts to AFOL communities on TikTok, told Business Insider. \"I think they'll put more investment in tech as it can increase the overall purchase price.\"\n\nThe bricks can sense what's happening around them, including light detection, player movement, and proximity to other figurines. When multiple Smart Bricks are used together, they communicate wirelessly with one another, allowing Lego sets to react in coordinated ways.\n\nLego says the system doesn't rely on AI or a constant internet connection. The bricks charge wirelessly, don't require disposable batteries, and play pre-programmed sounds directly from built-in speakers.\n\nThe company plans to debut the technology in three \"Star Wars\"-themed sets: a $70 Darth Vader set with 473 pieces, a $100 Luke's Red Five X-Wing set with 584 pieces, and a $160 Darth Vader's Throne Room Duel & A-Wing set with 962 pieces. They will hit store shelves on March 1.\n\n\"This isn't changing direction from what the Lego brand has always been,\" Tom Donaldson, the head of Legos's Creative Play Lab, told Business Insider in a statement. \"It's an expansion — we're staying true to our brand while innovating to meet how kids play today. The Lego brick our fans know and love isn't going anywhere; we're just making our play even more magical.\"\n\nBob Friedland, 50, a toy expert and former Toys R Us executive, told Business Insider he isn't planning to buy the Lego Smart Play sets when they launch.\n\nRight now, he owns 115 sets, according to his Lego app. That includes collections themed around \"Hocus Pocus,\" \"Stranger Things,\" and van Gogh's Starry Night. In a phone interview, Friedland said he's more interested in a $28, fully analog Lego DeLorean DMC replica from \"Back to the Future.\"\n\nHe said that Lego — which launched a 9,000-piece Star Wars-themed build for $999 in September — risks alienating already inflation-strained customers with increasingly expensive sets.\n\n\"These bricks will definitely bump up against the already-existing feeling that Lego is too expensive,\" he said.\n\nSmart Play isn't Lego's first attempt to blend bricks with technology.\n\nIn 1998, the company launched Lego Mindstorms, a line of programmable robotics kits that allowed builders to create machines that responded to sensors and computer code. More recently, Lego introduced the Lego Super Mario line in 2020, which featured interactive figures that triggered sound effects when placed on certain blocks.\n\nFriedland said that much of the online concern around toy \"tech-ification\" is attributable to other companies focusing on launching AI in teddy bears and dolls.\n\nMattel, for example, has partnered with OpenAI to put AI tech in some Barbie dolls. Child development researchers have warned that AI-enabled plushies aren't meeting basic safety standards. Online chatbots have appeared on children's iPads.\n\nBut other parents said they aren't sure their Lego-loving kids are even going to be interested in the company's new tech.\n\n\"As an adult fan, my joy stems from the building process and sharing that experience with my kids,\" Reid Exley, 43, a father of two and Lego enthusiast with more than 50 sets, said. \"My kids would likely enjoy the novelty of the sounds and interactivity. However, I suspect that novelty would quickly wear off and Lego play would remain largely unchanged.\"\n\nSome fans see Lego's launch of the Smart Play system less as a distraction — and more as an intriguing puzzle with potential.\n\n\"Are dolls that cry less creative than dolls that don't? Not really,\" Friedland said. \"I can already see myself trying to figure out Easter eggs that are unlocked by placing the Smart Brick in the right place or tapping it in the right sequence while it's next to the right colored brick.\"\n\nHe also told Business Insider that the current state of childhood play needs some new tech disruption. The Lego set, in his mind, could fit that bill.\n\n\"Parents who are wary of tech will likely look at this as a better alternative than a phone or iPad,\" he said. \"I think this is a much better solution than the AI toys out there.\"",

    "description": "What happens when you show up to work with a new nose, face, or body? That's a dilemma more workers are facing.",
    "fullText": "It's nice when a coworker compliments your new haircut. But what about your new face, nose, or body?\n\nWhen Jennifer Vaughan, 55, returned to work as a substitute teacher after her facelift, nobody said anything outright. Vaughan worried, \"God, is it not enough of a difference that somebody isn't asking?\"\n\nHowever, there were signs her coworkers were just being polite. One teacher did a double take and stammered their way through asking if something had changed. She told a few other teachers, and said, \"They were like, 'Okay, I thought something was up, but I wasn't totally sure.'\"\n\nNearly 1.6 million Americans opted for cosmetic surgery in 2024, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons; this follows a pandemic-era boom, during which procedures increased by 19% from 2019 to 2022.\n\nWith the return-to-office era in full swing, we're seeing our coworkers in person more often. Those with a new face, body, or waistline can't hide behind a camera-off virtual meeting. It's a tricky line to toe; yes, your appearance has changed — hopefully in a way you enjoy — but is it worth drawing attention to? How will coworkers respond, and should they?\n\nBigger picture, however, workers might keep finding it's worth it to go under the knife. Being hot at work is, empirically, a good way to get ahead; research has shown that good-looking workers see a real wage boost from an attractiveness premium.\n\nIn some cases, it could also be bonding. One worker I spoke with said that she learned about her Botox injector from a coworker; another said that she kept a nose job a strict secret, even after feeling pressure from managers to fess up.\n\nVaughan said that after the initial awkwardness, she has been an open book about her facelift. She also documented it on social media. Some of her coworkers have openly shared about getting liposuction or facial procedures, too.\n\nFor Kelsey Sowder, an Indianapolis-based 33-year-old in public relations, talking about her cosmetic procedures — from Botox to microneedling to the more intensive laser treatment she recently underwent — is part of her workplace experience. She works in a predominantly female office and openly discusses getting Botox with her coworkers.\n\n\"We're like, 'Look at my forehead. It looks amazing,'\" Sowder said. She and her coworkers will chat about what they might want to get done next. Sowder even found her first Botox injector from a coworker's recommendation.\n\n\"Luckily, I work at a place where there is no shame in discussing those things,\" she said. \"It's more of a camaraderie, and I feel very comfortable explaining what I do transparently and having that be well received, or people are respectful about it, and they're like, 'You know what? OK, maybe that's not for me, but that's for you.'\"\n\nFor some coworkers, it's a bonding experience. Procedures like Botox and filler, which don't usually require a full surgical experience, are immensely popular, with injectable procedures growing 4% year-over-year in 2024 to nearly 10 million patients, per ASPS; it's become, to some degree, destigmatized. The stereotype of an older celebrity with a Botox-frozen face has been supplanted by young influencers and professionals — and has even expanded to include more men. When speaking to coworkers about this story, several readily told me they'd had Botox and were under the impression that everyone was doing it.\n\nIt was a very different story when Mia McCormack, 33, got a rhinoplasty — colloquially known as a nose job — and chin implant over a decade ago. At the time, the Kentucky-based McCormack was working in retail and chose not to tell any of her coworkers that she was undergoing the procedure.\n\nShe said that her manager criticized her decision to keep the surgery to herself, believing that she should be open about why she took time off. When she came back two weeks later, a regular customer and a coworker immediately clocked the change, and her male coworkers assumed she had had her wisdom teeth removed because her cheeks were puffy.\n\nNow that time has passed, McCormack is happy to be open about the surgery. If she did it again today, she's not sure whether she'd share — she said she'd still err more on the side of privacy. But she does sense the changing tides.\n\n\"I think the stigma, it's definitely changed. I feel like so many people are getting stuff done more,\" McCormack said.\n\nAnother factor is the changing shape of work: A lot of offices are back in person and, in an otherwise dreary jobs market, healthcare services have been a rare bright spot. That means more Americans working in fields that are exposed to, and may even provide, some of these services.\n\nDr. Soheila Rostami, an oculofacial plastic surgeon in Virginia, said that while engineers, \"IT, and politicians don't talk about it,\" those in the medical field are very open with each other about getting work done; influencers and entertainers are also forthcoming.\n\nOne of those health professionals is Jennifer Belen, a 52-year-old medical spa consultant. She shared her facelift experience with her peers, coworkers, and close friends — and documented it on social media.\n\n\"I healed incredibly well. My bruising was mild,\" Belen said. \"I was back at work on day 11. I was in a field that I could explain to people like, 'Oh, I had a facelift.'\"\n\nIf she were in a different job, she said, she might have taken more time off or disclosed less. But her coworkers are eagle-eyed and understanding. She also felt she could be authentic with patients: She could explain what they could do without surgical intervention, and then use herself as an example of what surgery can achieve.\n\n\"I've had a couple friends that have gone for consults since I had my surgery, and I have so many people reach out on TikTok,\" Belen said.\n\nOf course, plastic surgery is still far from the norm and financially out of reach for many. Even the ever-popular Botox can run around $500 per session.\n\nThere's also a tricky line to toe between using plastic surgery as a means to express agency versus using it to conform to societal standards, which could also open the door for professional advancement.\n\n\"It is a challenge because people who do completely elective procedures often are doing so because they are in groups that are most likely to be discriminated against or left behind in the workplace,\" author and sociologist Kjerst Gruys said, referring to women, people of color, older folks, and those who are not thin.\n\nGruys said that she wants people to feel like they're making a willful choice to undergo expensive or risky beauty enhancements rather than \"because they're concerned that they won't have the opportunities that they deserve if they don't look a certain way.\"\n\nMcCormack, who underwent a rhinoplasty and chin implant while working in retail, said she noticed her sales increased after the tweaks, especially from male customers.\n\nFor Belen, the medical spa consultant, undergoing plastic surgery helped her align her self-perception with what she saw in the mirror. She has received questions on social media from the surgery-curious — some of whom see it as something that can give them a competitive edge at work.\n\n\"I've had a couple people say they just feel like they're in a young world and they're older and they don't want to be seen as aging out of their career,\" Belen said.\n\nFor Michael Conigliaro, 55, the change has felt positive. At first, he was nervous — he had grown his hair out to distract from his neck lift, deep plane facelift, cheek implants, upper and lower blepharoplasty, buccal fat removal, Erbium laser, and fat transfer.\n\nStill, he documented his journey online. Southern California-based Conigliaro has worked in and around beauty and aesthetics for most of his career; he's currently a patient coordinator for a well-known orthodontist.\n\nHowever, he still felt some nerves about returning to work. It was more psychological: Did he look substantially different? Had he made the right call?\n\nBut ultimately, he feels that the surgery has opened doors for him at work. He's strengthened bonds with patients who have also undergone surgery, and has felt a tangible confidence boost.\n\n\"When you take this step, it's not selfish,\" Conigliaro said. \"Do it because you show up better, you show up more confident, you're in work — depending on the type of field that you're in — more confident in what you're doing because you feel good.\"",

    "description": "\"For Love & Money\" answers your relationship and money questions. This week, a reader is angry about her parents' adapted parenting style.",
    "fullText": "I am the oldest daughter of three siblings. I'm three years older than my brother and 12 years older than my sister. We have a great, tight-knit family, and my parents have always showered us with love.\n\nHowever, my issue is that my parents have changed their parenting style, and my younger sister is having a very different experience from the one I had, even though my dad still works the same job as he did 12 years ago, and my mom still stays home.\n\nI had to work and take out loans to attend college and cover my lifestyle needs after graduating from high school. However, I found out over the holidays that my sister, who graduates this spring, will attend college entirely on my parents' dime. She has never had to work a job because they worry it will distract her from her grades.\n\nI barely concealed my anger when I found out, but the more I think about it, the angrier I get. I don't want to start anything with my parents, and I do like where I am in life, but my late teens and early 20s were really difficult for me, and I am still repaying student loans. I know if I don't confront them about this now, I'm likely to blow up on them about it eventually. How do I talk to them about this?\n\nOn a crisp April day in 2004, my mom picked me up from my homeschool co-op with a surprise in the back seat: a tiny baby girl, 15 years my junior. In the early days, I helped my mom care for my little sister, but within a few years, I transitioned to being more like a frequent houseguest after leaving for college. I wanted to bond with my sister during my visits home, but I often found myself distracted by my parents' brand-new parenting style, in which screen limits ceased to exist and the \"Oh come on, you aren't sick!\" of my childhood was replaced with \"I don't think she feels good\" every time my sister misbehaved.\n\nComedian Nate Bergatze has a great bit on this phenomenon, describing his much younger sister apparently being \"raised by her best friends\" rather than by the tightly structured, rule-heavy parents who defined his own upbringing.\n\nAs I was writing this column, I texted my mother to ask her about the disparity. She explained, \"As a young parent, you think your kids aren't bothered or harmed by various external hardships. But as you get older, you see the impact, and so you become more protective of your younger child's emotional health, and that might look like too much grace.\"\n\nMy mom's explanation seems to tally with your experience. Your struggles in your late teens and early 20s are likely the very reason your parents have tried to ease your sister's entrée to adulthood. This may translate into something that looks like favoritism, but it actually reflects the time and energy they've spent reviewing your upbringing and what they wish they'd done differently for you.\n\nThere's also a good chance your parents' financial situation has improved in the last 12 years, saving steadily despite having the same jobs they've always had. Parenting philosophies tend to align with a family's financial means. For instance, if I have money to spend on the new Nike sneakers that all the cool kids at school are wearing, I'll build a whole case in my mind around my kid's self-esteem to justify buying them. However, if I don't have the money to do so, I suddenly have no interest in raising materialistic conformists. Perhaps your parents valued self-sufficiency when you were coming of age, due to their financial constraints at the time, but now value stability and provision, given they can afford it.\n\nUnderstanding an explanation, however, doesn't mean the changes your parents have made for your sister don't hurt you, or that you need to spare your parents' feelings about their impact on you. As you alluded to, talking about these things is the best way to keep ourselves from falling out over them.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean you need to have a huge, emotional conversation about it, however. Instead, the dialogue should take the form that best suits your goals. If you want your parents' financial support to pay off your remaining college debt, I suggest approaching the conversation seriously. Schedule the discussion in advance, and during the meeting, focus on your financial need and only mention your sister's situation as the reason you felt you could ask. Don't accuse your parents of favoritism or dwell on your hurt feelings.\n\nYou could say something like, \"You mentioned paying for my sister's tuition the other day, and I'm so glad you're able to do that. I remember how stressful it was for me to work and take out loans during college. I understand that our family's financial situation was different back then, and I don't blame you for it. However, now that you're in a more stable position, I was wondering if you could help cover some of my education costs as well, since I still have a lot of college debt.\" This way, the comparison speaks for itself without putting your parents on the defensive.\n\nHowever, if you've accepted the way things are, but would like to address the hurt you feel, I wouldn't schedule a whole conversation for it. I would simply start talking about it as it comes up — even joking about it, Nate Bargatze-style. For instance, when I texted my mom to get a quote about parenting her youngest very differently than her older children, I didn't offer a qualifier or soften my reasoning for why she might be an expert on the topic. She knows I feel this way because when my sister dyed her hair blue at 15, I reminded everyone that when I came home from college at 19 with a cartilage piercing, Mom made me take it out.\n\nYour family will likely recognize the real sense of injustice behind your jokes and comments. Sure, it may annoy them, and it will absolutely annoy your sister, but there's nothing wrong with gently telling your truth. Your parents have changed their parenting style without apology; this is your honest response.\n\nI only gave my mom 10 minutes to respond with a quote because I was on a deadline, after all. She didn't argue the past; she explained it. Because we all know how it was. We make allowances for one another's humanity — my entitled demands for quotes, her evolving her parenting style, which I couldn't reap the benefits of. To me, that's the real proof of loving families like mine and yours; we can handle the truth because we know what we share is bigger than all of it. We keep these loving relationships strong by not holding resentment or anger inside, but instead addressing those feelings as honestly and constructively as we can.\n\nLooking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships?

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it's \"naive\" to think the US will shift away from China.\n\n\"The idea of decoupling for whatever reason, philosophical reasons or national security reasons, it's not based on any common sense,\" Huang said during an episode of the \"No Priors\" podcast posted on Thursday.\n\nHuang, whose company is eagerly awaiting the ability to sell advanced chips in China again, praised President Donald Trump's approach to navigating the relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\n\"I am optimistic that our relationship with China will improve, that President Trump and the administration has a really, really grounded and common-sense attitude and philosophy around how to think about China, that they're an adversary, but they're also a partner in many ways, and that the idea of decoupling is naive.\"\n\nNvidia may soon be returning to the lucrative Chinese market, which Huang once estimated could be worth $50 billion a year.\n\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that China planned to approve some sales of Nvidia's H200 chips \"as soon as this quarter.\" In December, Trump lifted a Biden-era policy that effectively banned Nvidia from selling its older H200 in China, provided the US government gets a 25% cut on future sales. Huang has repeatedly said that the US will not slow down China's AI advancements by curtailing the sales of advanced chips.\n\nHuang said on Tuesday that he was not expecting a formal announcement from Beijing approving the sales of H200 chips. China previously imposed its restrictions on such sales.\n\n\"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said during a news conference on the sidelines of CES in Las Vegas. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"\n\nAs for the broader US-China relationship, Huang said that both nations ought to continue to invest in their own independence. Trump has deployed a combination of tariffs and incentives to encourage US-based companies to bring their manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\"When you depend too much on someone, the relationship becomes too emotional, as you know,\" Huang said. \"And so it's good to have some independence or there as much independence as either would like, but to recognize that there's a lot of coupling, a lot of dependence between the two countries. And I think there needs to be a nuanced strategy, a nuanced attitude about how to manage this relationship in a productive way for all of the people of two countries and for all of the people around the world.\"\n\nThe world needs both sides to figure it out, Huang said.\n\n\"Everybody depends on a productive, constructive relationship of the two most important nations and the single most important relationship for the next century,\" he said. \"And so we have to find that answer.\"",

    "description": "Nancy Green joined Levi Strauss & Co. to lead the Beyond Yoga brand in 2022. She works out often and is a member at Erewhon for the salads.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nancy Green, the CEO of Beyond Yoga, who's based in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent my entire career in retail, starting in college, where I worked on the shop floor. I spent nearly three decades with Gap Inc., across two stints, raising four kids while building global brands. One of the highlights was scaling Athleta from a $250 million business to a billion-dollar powerhouse.\n\nIn 2022, I joined Levi Strauss & Co. to lead the Beyond Yoga brand. This brand feels like a perfect fit for me — it sits right at the intersection of wellness, joy, and community.\n\nI do a lot of workouts. I love yoga classes, Pilates, lifting weights, and hiking — all in Beyond Yoga wear, of course.\n\nHere's what a typical day looks like for me.\n\nI wake up around 6 am, whether I'm at home in the Bay Area or Los Angeles, to go into the office. The first thing I need is coffee. My husband makes a beautiful latte when he's around, but I'm perfectly happy to make one myself.\n\nI quickly scan emails and the news to see if there's anything urgent. Then I carve out time for movement. I'm not wedded to one routine — I enjoy mixing it up.\n\nIn the Bay Area, I'll lace up my sneakers and hike right out my back door into the hills, surrounded by nature. In LA, I'll either go for a power walk outside or head to the gym in my apartment building. I alternate between strength training and cardio during the week, and I reserve Pilates or yoga for the weekends.\n\nI aim for 35-45 minutes of exercise per day. That time isn't just about fitness — it's when I set my intentions. The way you walk into the office matters. My role is to read the moment and set the right tone.\n\nI shower, get dressed, and usually have a high-protein breakfast of Greek yogurt with organic berries.\n\nTuesdays are early flight days. I'm up at 4:45 am to head to the airport and fly to LA, where I stay for three to four days. I keep an apartment there so I can drop my bags and get straight to work.\n\nWhat drains me is unnecessary negative energy. I don't expect everyone to be positive all the time, but constant negativity that isn't productive can be exhausting. That's why I protect my energy and focus on bringing an upbeat, optimistic tone into the office.\n\nMost days, I arrive at the Beyond Yoga office by 9 a.m. That first stretch of the morning is usually about setting the agenda.\n\nTuesdays start with a business update meeting: What did we learn last week? What's trending? What needs adjusting? It gives everyone clarity and momentum.\n\nWe design and manufacture all our own products, so the quality of our fabrics is of the utmost importance. They need to be beautiful, durable, and versatile — pants that look just as good on the trails of Marin County as they do on the streets of New York.\n\nI'm a creature of habit with food. Breakfast is always protein-forward, and lunch is nearly always a salad.\n\nIn LA, there's nothing right near the office, so I either order delivery or I stop by Erewhon. True confession — I'm an Erewhon member. I don't buy everything there, but I really love their salads.\n\nMy assistant does her best to keep 45 minutes protected, although sometimes business intrudes and someone needs to run something by me while I'm eating.\n\nAfternoons can be intense. We run on a quarterly \"concept to customer\" cycle, and the milestone meetings that anchor it can last multiple days. We'll review samples for next year's line, align on design direction, and make critical investment decisions.\n\nOn other afternoons, I'll be in creative reviews, reviewing brand campaigns, or engaging in strategy conversations about real estate and store growth. There's always a decision that needs to be made quickly, or a trend that requires a response.\n\nThings come at me constantly. Sometimes it's a genuine crisis, and other times it's something personal, such as when a child is ill. You must lead through all of it and shift your focus when necessary.\n\nThere will always be curveballs, but as a leader, you can't let them derail you. Staying calm and steady matters. I need to be able to react, pivot, and refocus, but I can't be effective if every unexpected moment throws me off.\n\nI often pop into a store on my way home because we're trying something that I want to see for myself. Fridays are sacred, and I spend them in our stores.\n\nI grew up in retail on the shop floor, and I love being where the energy is — seeing how product shows up, hearing directly from customers, and connecting with store teams. It's the best way to keep the feedback loop alive.\n\nI try to finish by 6-7 p.m. at the latest. That habit stems from raising my kids, when family dinners were a non-negotiable part of our routine. Even though they're grown, I still anchor myself to that rhythm.\n\nEvenings are about balance — sometimes it's a business dinner, other nights I'll cook with my husband. I might pour a glass of wine, catch up on the news I missed during the day, or relax with a good series on Netflix or Apple TV. I just finished \"Ripple.\"\n\nI'm not rigid, but I prioritize sleep: if I'm up at 6 a.m., I need to be asleep by 10 p.m. so I can get a full eight hours.\n\nLeading a brand through growth takes stamina, so I prioritize wellness and surround myself with great people. You have to do what you love and love what you do — I feel lucky that after decades in this industry, I still do.",

    "fullText": "Point72's chief strategy officer is no longer at the $41.5 billion hedge fund.\n\nJames Malick, who joined Steve Cohen's firm in 2023, departed the asset manager this week, two people familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Malick did not respond to requests for comment, while Point72 declined to comment.\n\nMalick joined from Izzy Englander's Millennium, which also recently lost an executive focused on strategy, Alexander Campbell, Business Insider previously reported. Like Campbell, Malick came to the hedge-fund world after a stint at Boston Consulting Group.\n\nA person close to the firm said Malick was a member of the firm's senior leadership team, responsible for reviewing new business opportunities and leading strategic initiatives.\n\nMalick states on his LinkedIn profile that he was also an advisor for the MLB's New York Mets, the baseball team owned by Cohen. He will no longer be consulting for the team, the person said.\n\nPoint72 has expanded into new areas in recent years. The firm launched a private credit business as well as a fund dedicated to investing in the artificial intelligence trend, known as Turion. This year, the manager launched an additional equities vertical, Valist, to improve access to corporate C-suites. And, as Business Insider previously reported, Cohen told his firm's backers that commodities may be the next area of expansion for the firm.\n\nCorporate strategy roles are still not common in the $5 trillion hedge fund industry, but as firms, especially the expansive multistrategy managers that have come to dominate the space, have become increasingly institutional and have tapped talent from consultancies and banks to fill their management ranks and non-investing roles.\n\nFor example, Point72, which states on its website that it has more than 3,000 employees globally, recruited its chief operating officer, Gavin O'Connor, from Goldman Sachs, where he worked for over two decades.",

    "description": "Industry insiders say Trump's call to ban big investors is out of sync with how those players actually buy homes.",
    "fullText": "Trump's pledge to upend Wall Street's 15-year push into the market for single-family American homes raised alarms across the real estate investment industry — and skepticism.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about it,\" said Todd Henderson, the head of real estate for the Americas at DWS, an investment firm that has purchased single-family rental homes.\n\nWhile details of Trump's proposal are unknown, Henderson expects that it will eventually exclude institutional buyers who have purchased newly built homes, which have become the focus of much of the single-family rental (SFR) industry.\n\n\"The fear is that large investors are buying single-family homes and that it's taking out of the sales pool and driving up the cost of housing — that's what is driving this discussion,\" Henderson said. \"We're building this stuff and adding it to supply.\"\n\nIn a message on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that he was \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSome analysts, however, suggested that that view was out of step with the institutional SFR industry's contemporary business model, which has shifted away from the inefficient — and politically sensitive practice — of competing against everyday homebuyers to scoop up properties one by one.\n\nInvitation Homes, a public company that is one of the largest owners of SFR homes, \"has almost exclusively moved to acquiring homes from homebuilders rather than on the MLS,\" according to a research note from RBC.\n\n\"AMH's external growth comes from development rather than acquisitions,\" Barclays wrote in a report, referring to American Homes 4 Rent, another large SFR owner.\n\nTrump's announcement caused shares of Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent to fall by about 7% and 9% respectively, according to KBW.\n\nOther major investors, including Blackstone, also saw an impact on share prices. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, a non-trade REIT managed by the firm, holds about $11 billion worth of SFR investments totaling about 9% of its portfolio.\n\nJade Rahmani, an analyst at KBW, wrote that the market reaction \"seems excessive and could present a buying opportunity\" in a Wednesday report on the potential ban.\n\nDetails were scant about how Trump's prohibition on Wall Street homebuying would work.\n\nTrump said that he would be \"calling on Congress to codify it\" and that he would \"discuss this topic\" during \"my speech in Davos in two weeks.\"\n\nTrump has walked back policies, such as his tariffs, due to disruptions to the economy and investor concerns.\n\nThe likely need for congressional approval could insert more complexity — and uncertainty — over the process of formalizing an SFR ban.\n\nA Mizuho report said that Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno had proposed a bill to codify Trump's SFR ban, but that it \"doesn't believe\" it will progress \"anytime soon.\"\n\nHenderson said he believes that any rules imposed on the SFR industry would exempt both builders and buyers of new SFR homes and would allow major investors to sell existing portfolios freely. Such caveats would leave the SFR industry basically unchanged.\n\n\"I think it will increase the value of the purpose-built SFR homes and make that strategy even more valuable,\" Henderson said.\n\nThe SFR industry has pointed out that its investors own a comparatively small share of the roughly 80 million single-family homes in the country.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors who own 10 residential units or more held about 3.4% of all single-family homes, and that larger investors with at least 1,000 units controlled just 0.73% of the inventory.\n\n\"Professional single-family housing providers represent a small segment of the overall housing market, and the single-family rental industry remains focused on supporting renters while also supporting pathways to homeownership,\" said a spokeswoman for National Rental Home Council, an industry group that represents SFR owners.",

    "fullText": "Saving for retirement has been a cornerstone of personal finance for well over a century. It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Musk's blue-sky vision of an abundant future may seem like wishful thinking — or even dangerous advice if it leads people to stop saving, but the world doesn't change as he expects, leaving them short in retirement.",

    "description": "All it took was a pledge for $1.5 trillion in military spending to spark a reversal in the sector.",
    "fullText": "The \"TACO trade,\" short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was one of the great market memes of 2025. Whenever the market would throw a tantrum about a Trump policy — usually related to tariffs — the president would reverse course to stem the bleeding.\n\nA similar story has played out this week within US defense stocks, with a few unique twists. Here's the minute-by-minute recap from Wednesday afternoon:\n\nIt was that last statement, 2 hours and 9 minutes after Trump's first post about defense companies, that sparked a rally in those exact same defense stocks on Thursday. The optimism of a huge spending increase had offset the initial sting of industry criticism.\n\nIt wasn't a precise TACO trade situation. It was closer to something I'd like to coin as the TUNA trade: Trump Usually Negates Announcements. The president didn't outright reverse a prior statement. He countered a bearish opinion with something bullish that counterbalanced it. There's a big difference!\n\nThe volatile episode leaves questions unanswered about the future of the industry. The knee-jerk reaction from investors was to buy/sell first, then ask questions later. What does the longer term look like?\n\nWall Street analysts generally support the idea that the additional military spending will offset any new capital restrictions.\n\n\"The changes are significant but not necessarily draconian,\" said JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman. A \"potential budget increase would support sustained growth, taking some sting out of the executive order.\"\n\nKen Herbert, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says large-cap defense companies will feel the squeeze more than their defense-tech counterparts, which he sees outperforming.\n\n\"Defense primes will look to de-risk major program investments by securing long-term purchase agreements, where possible,\" he added.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu called Trump's comments an \"overreach\" and said that they catalyzed something that was already bound to happen.\n\n\"The industry has been clear that it is ready to invest on clearer demand signals,\" she said.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, $1.5 trillion in 2027 sounds quite appealing. If all goes according to plan — and that's a big \"if\" — more stock gains could be in store for defense companies.",

A 7,500-year-old stone seal recently unearthed at the site predates the kingdom of Urartu, which is already known for having had complex and organized social structures, but the seal reflects that they had already begun to take shape millennia before the rise of Urartu. Excavations that led to the discovery of the seal and other objects were overseen by the Elazig Museum and the Provincial Directorate of Culture and Tourism, with support from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Elazig Governorship.\n\n“The findings show that the region was not only inhabited since the earliest times, but also developed sophisticated social, economic, and cultural practices that influenced later civilizations,” governor Numan Hatipoğlu told Türkiye Today.\n\nWhat exactly the seal was used for remains unknown, but archaeologists think it might have been a marker of property or ownership. It may have also signified personal identity. This is a rare example of relatively advanced social organization in such an early culture. Investigations as to what it reveals about Neolithic administration, daily life and social activity are ongoing. Archaeological studies in Elazig are part of the preservation efforts of the Turkish Ministry’s Heritage for the Future Project. It is the only stone seal found so far, but another seal locally known as ‘cec damga muhru’ was found to have been used in the trading of grain, reinforcing evidence of a structured society and economy.\n\nThis is not the first groundbreaking find at Tadım Fortress. While it is one of the oldest, buried beneath vessels and other objects left behind by the Byzantine, Roman, Seljuk and Ottoman empires, other artifacts and structures revealed how people lived slightly after the period when the seal was made. A temple that was also recently discovered at the site is now some of the oldest evidence of ritual architecture in the region. Dating to the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, around 6,000 years ago, it features a stone altar with a ritual blood channel. Cut marks on the altar, along with animal and human remains, suggest blood sacrifice to appease deities. The temple shows that many aspects of life back then were closely tied to religion and ritual.\n\nNear the temple are the remnants of both ceremonial and everyday items, including tools and seal stamps that were likely used for agricultural trade, much like the one found along with the stone seal. There were also idol figurines on four podiums supposedly used for devotional offerings. Possibly the most striking is a hearth meant to keep a holy flame burning. Unique double-headed hearths carved with images of animals had previously been found at Tadım, with a jug beside them that is thought to have once held sacrificial blood or wine. Fire was sacred to many ancient cultures, such as the ancient Greeks and Romans, who associated it with Hestia (also Vesta), goddess of home and hearth.\n\nFindings including the stone seal are now undergoing analysis and preservation at the Elazig Archaeology and Ethnography Museum. Excavations in Tadım are ongoing, and the deeper archaeologists dig, the further back in time they will travel, with objects that have not seen the light of the sun in thousands and thousands of years potentially surfacing as a result.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "The higher spending on AI chips is going to be a tailwind for TSMC stock in 2026.\n\nIts earnings are likely to grow at a faster pace than Wall Street's expectations this year.\n\nTSMC's attractive valuation and strong earnings potential suggest that it could soar nicely.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nThe S&P 500 has been in a bull market for more than three years now, entering this territory in October 2022, and the good news is that the index is expected to sustain its rally in 2026 as well.\n\nAfter recording three consecutive years of double-digit gains, a feat that the index has achieved five times since it came into existence in 1957, Wall Street is looking forward to another year of robust growth in the S&P 500. Deutsche Bank, for instance, expects the S&P 500 to hit 8,000 points by the end of 2026, suggesting potential gains of 15% from current levels.\n\nAdditionally, financial services firm Carson Group's chief market strategist Ryan Detrick points out that once a bull market is three years old, it tends to stretch up to eight years on average, citing data going back to 1950. All this indicates that 2026 could turn out to be another good year for the stock market, and artificial intelligence (AI) is set to play a key role in driving more gains this year.\n\nJPMorgan points out that strong capital spending and earnings growth fueled by AI are going to be a catalyst for stocks in 2026. That's why now is a good time to take a closer look at a key company that's playing a central role in driving AI adoption -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) -- before the stock market heads higher in the new year.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, manufacturing chips for all the leading chip designers and consumer electronics companies. That explains why it has been growing at a healthy pace in the past couple of years. TSMC's share of the foundry market stood at an incredible 72% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Counterpoint Research. Its fabrication plants that produce advanced chips for customers, such as Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Apple, Sony, Advanced Micro Devices, and others, are reportedly running at full capacity.\n\nThis isn't surprising as the cutting-edge nature of TSMC's advanced manufacturing nodes means that chip designers are able to pack in more transistors into a smaller area on chips fabricated by the Taiwan-based giant. As a result, TSMC-made chips are both powerful and power-efficient, making them ideal for various applications, including data centers, smartphones, and personal computers (PCs).Deloitte estimates that $250 billion to $300 billion could be spent on AI data center chips alone this year, up from an estimated $150 billion last year.",

That's the ambitious timeline Boston Dynamics set for its Atlas humanoid robots to start working on Hyundai's factory floor.\n\nThe company's CEO, Robert Playter, told Business Insider at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that Atlas will need to hit several milestones within that timeframe to get there, including an ability to learn fast.\n\n\"We need to be able to bring a new task to bear in a day or two,\" Playter said. \"And that's because, I think in a factory, there's literally hundreds of tasks and the tasks evolve.\"\n\nAtlas is a six-foot, 200-pound, bipedal robot with a face inspired by Disney's Pixar lamp.\n\nHyundai, which has a controlling majority stake in Boston Dynamics, revealed on Monday its plans to deploy Atlas at its sprawling factory in Ellabell, Georgia, by 2028.\n\nThe big pitch behind Atlas is that the robot will be able to learn industrial tasks quickly and adapt to the existing floor plan of a factory by leveraging artificial intelligence.\n\n\"If you're going to have a robot that's actually useful in the factory, it's got to do a hundred different tasks, not just one or two,\" he said.\n\nBoston Dynamics announced on Monday a partnership with Google DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research lab.\n\nPlayter is hinging on AI's advancement within the next two years to unlock Atlas' ability to learn quickly, reason, and, in the near future, interact with its human coworkers.\n\n\"It's really AI that's going to enable that,\" he said. \"We also have to make that unprecedented reliability, 99.9% reliable. The AI is not quite there yet, but it's very promising.\"\n\nThe CEO said Atlas will start with simpler tasks at Hyundai's automotive plant, such as parts sequencing or organizing car parts in the right order before they're sent to the assembly line.\n\n\"That's really a logistics task,\" he said. \"And then we're going to evolve as the product and as the capabilities get more sophisticated. We're going to eventually start entering assembly tasks.\"",

Higher earners can prop up spending in the short run, shielding cracks by lower earners who might not have the same spending or earning power, but eventually those cracks may win out, pushing the economy into a downturn.\n\n\"Most of the consumption does happen by people who have more means,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a December press conference. \"I think the top third accounts for way more than a third of the consumption, for example. So, it's a good question how sustainable that is.\"\n\nJed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said on X that the reasons behind the low hiring aren't necessarily due to artificial intelligence or the Trump administration's policies.\n\n\"Hiring has been very low since 2024, and has flattened out,\" Kolko said. \"If it were AI, the hiring slowdown would have accelerated in 2025, rather than plunging earlier.

In the most recent reading of the New York Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Expectations, workers said that, if they lost their jobs today, the average probability of finding a role in the next three months was 43.1%. That's the lowest rate ever recorded since the New York Fed began tracking the measure.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the chief economist of New Century Advisors, thinks the low-hire, low-fire state isn't sustainable. She told Business Insider in December that she thinks the job market will go in one of two ways.\n\nOne way: \"We really slow down in terms of hiring, and we hit a place where the bottom falls out.

Economists have also said businesses did a lot of hiring in the pandemic recovery period, so they might not have needed to add a lot more employees since then.\n\n\"At some point, if you want to grow as a company, you're going to have to bring in more workers,\" Sahm said.\n\nThe November report showed that unemployment reached 4.6%, the highest rate since September 2021. Unemployment has been at or above 4% since May 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the US added 64,000 jobs, largely due to the healthcare sector, which added 46,300 jobs.

Afterward, the xAI CEO said he followed his own advice by uploading the results of a medical test to his company's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,\" Musk said during a wide-ranging interview with Diamandis on \"Moonshots\" posted on Tuesday. \"None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.\"\n\nIt's unclear why Musk underwent an MRI. His discussion with Diamandis, the founder of the XPrize and a Harvard-educated doctor, underscores the ongoing discussion about longevity that surrounds much of the discussion of AI's future development.\n\nAcross Silicon Valley, tech billionaires like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Peter Thiel are funding millions in research to combat aging and extend humanity's lifespan. In 2024, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote that AI could double life expectancy by 2030.\n\nLast week, Musk encouraged people to try uploading their results to Grok. He said that a Norwegian man posted on Reddit that Grok saved his life after the chatbot encouraged him to return to the hospital to get a CT scan, which confirmed that doctors had missed that his appendix was close to rupturing.\n\n\"Try it!\" Musk wrote on X, quote-tweeting remarks from a February 2025 appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nAt the time, Musk told Rogan that AI would be \"very good\" at helping with medical diagnoses.\n\nMusk said true immortality or close to it would be \"one of the worst curses you could possibly give anyone.\" That being said, the billionaire thinks it should be possible to crack the secret to staving off aging.\n\n\"I've long thought that longevity or semi-mortality is an extremely solvable problem,\" Musk said. \"I don't think it's a particularly hard problem. I mean, when you consider the fact that your body is extremely synchronized in its age, the clock must be incredibly obvious.\"\n\nDiamandis pitched Musk on working with Fountain Life, a longevity company that Diamandis cofounded with Tony Robbins and William Kapp. Depending on the membership tier, Fountain Life offers access to \"AI-guided diagnostics\" that test for biomarkers. The first goal of this branch of medicine, Kapp told TechCrunch last year, is \"don't die of anything stupid.\"\n\n\"We do a 200 gigabyte upload of you, everything knowable about you, full genome, all imaging, everything,\" Diamandis said, adding he did not want Musk \"to pull a Steve Jobs.\"\n\nApple's visionary leader died in 2011 of pancreatic cancer.

While each followed a different path, all of them spent roughly a year building the necessary skills to land new roles — and for some, the transition took several years.\n\nFrom participating in employee hackathons to becoming AI content creators, the four employees share how they made the shift:\n\nEmrick Donadei said he didn't feel qualified to pivot to an AI team until he participated in Google's seven-day employee hackathon in 2024. The 32-year-old engineer said he didn't create a revolutionary product, but it gave him hands-on experience with tools, and something tangible he could use to start conversations with teams across the company. \n\nRoughly 10 months after his first hackathon, he said he landed his new role.\n\nWhile the hackathon kick-started his transition, his work didn't stop there. The Googler continued to experiment with tools outside the hackathon, he said. He also created a podcast about AI developments and watched Andrej Karpathy's YouTube videos to get up to speed with machine learning concepts and anything related to LLMs.\n\nAfter finding a new role, Donadei said that he participated in another hackathon in 2025, which opened up even more opportunities. He had the opportunity to transition into AI research, began working part-time on open-source committees and with AI research teams, and published a public technical disclosure with Google as a follow-up to his work.\n\nMaitri Mangal, 27, worked as a traditional software engineer before transitioning to an AI team. During the roughly year-long period she took to prepare for the pivot, Mangal dedicated roughly two hours daily toward up-skilling, and still spends hours learning weekly, she said.\n\nShe said that creating social media content was a way for her to reinforce the material that she learned through Google's internal training and other online courses.\n\n\"That really, for me, changed everything,\" Mangal said about content creation.\n\nShe said seeing that her content helped other people motivated her to continue learning about the technology and making videos. Even though she already changed jobs, she said she still spends about an hour daily learning new information, whether that's in the form of internal trainings for her job, or watching YouTube courses to prepare for content.\n\nRahul Kasanagottu, 32, spent two and a half years transitioning to an AI role at the tech giant. He said his paternity leave gave him a head start on reading about AI.\n\nIn addition to reading 11 books on the topic, Kasanagottu also took a Deep Learning Specialization course taught by Andrew Ng, and watched 3Blue1Brown videos on YouTube.\n\nSimilar to Donadei, Kasanagottu said solo projects were a key part of his career transition. He said it was difficult to convince hiring managers he could do the job without having demos and hands-on projects to show. While the books he read typically didn't come with assignments, the courses had a lot of hands-on exercises, Kasanagottu said.\n\nMilica Cvetkovic took a different path than the other three Googlers who made internal pivots to AI teams. She landed a role in AI consulting at the tech giant about three years ago, after completing graduate school and conducting research in machine learning.\n\nAfter she received her Master's in statistics, she worked as a machine-learning engineer at a Madison-based startup and simultaneously taught machine-learning boot camps and college-level courses.\n\n\"Having a skill to talk in a nontechnical way is probably the most valuable skill that I bring,\" Cvetkovic said.\n\nHer move to an AI team at Google was less of a deliberate pivot and more the result of the right opportunity aligning with her background and interests. She said that she realized she didn't want to code anymore, and that's when she came across a consulting role at Google.\n\nCvetkovic said she can't name one single experience that led to her getting the job. Rather, she compared her career journey to training for a marathon. A marathon, she said, is the \"celebration of all the work that you've done.\"\n\n\"That's literally what my application was. It was just very good fit,\" Cvetkovic said.\n\nDid you transition to an AI role? We want to hear from you.

    "description": "I asked ChatGPT to break it down for me, given the state of crypto. It made clear that its answer is \"a structured way to think about the opportunity and risk.\"",
    "fullText": "Cryptocurrency is either touted as the next big thing to make you rich or the riskiest investment ever. Yet despite its volatility and constant controversy, many investors continue to find ways to profit in the crypto space.\n\nIf someone realistically wanted to get rich via cryptocurrency in 2026, which one is most likely to make that possible, and how? I asked ChatGPT to break it down for me, given the current state of crypto. It made clear that its answer does not constitute financial advice, but rather “a structured way to think about the opportunity and risk.”\n\nChatGPT took a realistic look at what “getting rich” actually means in the crypto space. It was clear that it doesn’t mean “guaranteed 100% returns by New Year,” as the crypto market is extremely volatile, risky and speculative.\n\nRealistic goals might look like a 5% to 10% return on your core position — the main portion of your crypto portfolio held in more established assets like bitcoin or ethereum that you plan to keep long term. You might also see a larger potential return on a smaller “moonshot” allocation — a high-risk, high-reward investment in a newer or less proven coin that could spike in value but could just as easily wipe out, too.\n\nAnalysts place wide predictions even on the giants. For example, bitcoin (BTC) is forecasted to be valued between $100,000 and $200,000 in 2026.\n\nFind Out: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You\n\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n\nBased on current expert commentary and fundamentals, ChatGPT said there are two categories of coins with the best shot at making you rich across two strategies.\n\nUnsurprisingly, bitcoin (BTC), the most well-known coin, remains the leading choice. Many forecasts assume it will stay dominant. However, ethereum (ETH), the runner-up, is seen as more utility-based, and some analysts believe it may outperform BTC in certain phases.\n\nIn either case, these coins are less about “getting rich quick” and more about a reasonable chance of strong returns at moderate risk, the AI said.\n\nSome investors are turning to altcoins — smaller cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin and ethereum — that could see bigger short-term gains. Coins like XRP and Solana are getting attention for their performance potential, though they come with higher risk, ChatGPT noted. Even newer projects, especially those combining AI and blockchain, promise sky-high returns, but most are highly speculative. Forecasts of 500% profits make headlines, but in reality, very few ever deliver.",

    "description": "When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words.  After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words. But no small part of that oil belongs to China under contracts it struck with Caracas years ago, setting the stage for a delicate diplomatic dance in the next few weeks.\n\nSome experts expect Trump to work with China in an effort to stabilize trade relations. After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.\n\n“The administration appears focused on avoiding unnecessary escalation or new irritants with Beijing while keeping leverage firmly on Washington’s terms,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nHe added that he doubted Trump would risk turning Venezuela into a “flashpoint that complicates trade dynamics or Trump’s personal engagement with Xi.”\n\nChina is owed at least $10 billion from Venezuela, according to various estimates, a debt that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had paid down by shipping oil to China. It is possible that the interim Venezuelan government complying with Washington’s demands could question the legality of those loans-for-oil deals and cease payments.\n\nTwo major Chinese state-owned enterprises — China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec — are entitled to 4.4 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela, the highest for any foreign country, according to a research note by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nU.S. companies also have claims for tens of billions of dollars from when Caracas nationalized the oil industry, and it’s not clear how these IOUs will be honored and in what order.\n\nThe U.S. seized two sanctioned oil tankers this week as part of a plan to assert control over Venezuelan oil shipments. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will handle the sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” depositing proceeds into U.S.-controlled accounts that will ultimately “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThe administration said this week that the U.S. would kickstart those sales with 30 million to 50 million barrels taken from the South American country’s crude storage facilities. Asked for more detail, a Trump administration official not authorized to comment publicly and speaking on condition of anonymity said U.S. policy was to wind down “adversarial outside influence” in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe U.S. using such leverage over a crucial natural resource comes after Beijing flexed its muscles last year by choking off critical supplies of rare-earth magnets and weaponizing its purchase of American soybeans in the trade war with Washington. When Trump met Xi in South Korea in October, the two men agreed to a one-year truce, backing off from sky-high tariffs and export controls on each other.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, Venezuela was the fourth-largest recipient of Beijing's official credit, having received $106 billion worth of loans from China’s official-sector creditors, according to AidData, a research lab at Virginia's College of William & Mary that tracks Beijing's overseas lending activities. But how much of the total that Caracas has paid off and what is still owed is unclear, said AidData executive director Brad Parks, because Caracas stopped reporting debt details several years ago.\n\nWhile some estimates put the outstanding debt at $10 billion, Parks said the figure could be much higher because U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil might have delayed loan repayments. The loans from China, under an unusual arrangement, were set up to be paid down with proceeds from oil exports.\n\nIn China, the capture of Maduro evoked memories of another leader who had struck deals with Chinese companies and then suddenly lost power: Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nAfter the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, Chinese businesses had to leave behind billions in investments. Cui Shoujun, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Chinese news and commentary site guancha.cn that the transition government in Caracas could deem agreements under Maduro unlawful and the debt to China illegal.\n\nAs in Libya, Beijing’s stakes in Venezuela have gone beyond oil. Chinese firms have invested in telecommunications, railways and ports in Venezuela, all now at risk, according to a report by the global financial firm Jefferies.\n\nStill, the firm noted that Beijing will likely manage any disruption because Venezuelan oil counted for only a small percentage of China's oil imports and because Beijing has diversified its energy supplies and pivoted to electrification.\n\nHours before he was captured by U.S. forces, Maduro hosted a high-level Chinese diplomat at the presidential palace and praised the countries' ties that had prospered from the days of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, and given Beijing a strong foothold in America's backyard.\n\nVenezuela is the only Latin American country that has a high-level strategic partnership with China, on par with close friends like Pakistan, and the ouster of Maduro is expected to curtail China's influence in the Western Hemisphere — in line with one of the goals spelled out in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\nBeijing's response to the capture of Maduro\n\nSoon after Maduro was captured, Beijing said it was “deeply shocked” by the blatant use of U.S. force against a sovereign state and action against its president and said it “strongly” condemned the U.S. actions. It called for the immediate release of Maduro and his wife.\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said Thursday that no nation has the right to interfere with economic and trade cooperation between China and Venezuela, which he said is between two sovereign states and protected by international and domestic laws.\n\n“No matter how the political situation in Venezuela evolves, China’s willingness to deepen bilateral economic and trade cooperation will not change,” He said.\n\nSingleton said Beijing does not wield the clout in the Western Hemisphere as touted.\n\n“Beijing can protest diplomatically,” he said, “but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure.”",

    "description": "Rob Reiner's son Nick Reiner's lawyer’s sudden decision to quit is being speculated to be due to financial reasons.",
    "fullText": "Nick Reiner's lawyer's sudden decision to quit is being speculated to be due to financial reasons.\n\nAlan Jackson was representing the accused up until his January 7 arraignment, during which he announced his decision to withdraw from the case. A public defender was subsequently assigned to Nick, and the hearing was rescheduled for February.\n\nNow, insiders have also claimed that Nick Reiner's family has completely cut him off financially and emotionally as they are \"devastated\" and \"cannot support him anymore.\"\n\nThe start of the new year brought the long-anticipated arraignment of Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old accused of killing his celebrity parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Reiner.\n\nHowever, on January 7, when the arraignment took place, his attorney, Alan Jackson, suddenly announced to the court that he was withdrawing from the case.\n\nSources have now shared with British journalist, Rob Shuter's #Shuterscoop, that the alleged killer's family has cut him off.\n\n\"The family has completely cut Nick off,\" a close source said. \"They are devastated. But they realized they cannot support him anymore—not financially, not emotionally, not morally.\"\n\nAnother source stated that Nick behaved badly with his legal team, which may have caused issues with Jackson.\n\n\"Even with the best legal team, a client has to cooperate. Nick's behavior over the past weeks—erratic, threatening, unpredictable—left no other choice. The family can't bankroll chaos,\" the source claimed.\n\n\"They loved him once,\" the insider continued, \"but what he did, what he became… it was monstrous. They can't protect him anymore, and they can't keep funding his destruction.\"\n\nWhile Jackson did not disclose his reasons for quitting, experts suggest that his decision was likely tied to the financial demands of the case.\n\nThe attorney is believed to be among the most sought-after defense attorneys and likely commanded at least a seven-figure retainer.\n\nThis expense, along with future legal costs, may have been too steep for the accused to sustain.\n\n\"Nick Reiner doesn't have the money, if he did, he wouldn't be living in his parents' guesthouse. And under the California Slayer Statute, you kill your parents — you're disinherited,\" said former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani, per the New York Post.\n\nAfter Jackson stepped away from the case, the court appointed public defender Kimberly Greene to represent the accused.\n\nThe arraignment has since been pushed to February, meaning Nick's plea remains unknown for now.\n\nThere has also been no indication that Nick's family plans to retain another private attorney.\n\nAccording to Seth Zuckerman, a defense lawyer who once represented actor Jonathan Majors in a domestic violence case, this is further proof that Jackson's exit may have been financially motivated.\n\n\"If they had the financial resources, they would go hire another private attorney,\" Zuckerman said of Nick's family.\n\nCriminal defense attorney Mark Bederow also shared similar sentiments as Rahmani and Zuckerman over Jackson's withdrawal.\n\n\"A representation like this could cost an extraordinary sum of money,\" Bederow said. \"Probably the money is not there.\n\n\"I don't know who is controlling the family assets, but I would imagine that whatever hope there had been from the client or the family, that it's just not there, and the defense costs so much,\" he added.\n\nSince Reiner's arrest in connection with the deaths of his parents, rumors that he could face the death penalty have circulated widely.\n\nThe speculation intensified after District Attorney Nathan Hochman addressed the case during a press conference in December.\n\nAt the time, Hochman stated that the murder counts Nick faces carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty.\n\nHowever, Rahmani and Bederow feel it is unlikely that Hochman will pursue the death penalty if Nick is found guilty.\n\n\"I don't think it will be a death penalty case. We haven't had an execution in California in almost 20 years,\" Rahmani said.\n\n\"There is no way this is going to end up being a death penalty case,\" Bederow also stated. \"I don't think the Reiner family would want that.\"\n\nIn line with Bederow's suggestion, the Reiner family has seemingly voiced their displeasure over the possibility of the death penalty.\n\nA source close to the family recently shared that they feel \"Nick is seriously ill,\" and ending his life will in no way bring back his late parents.\n\n\"They believe killing him won't bring Rob and Michele back — and it won't fix what went wrong,\" the insider told Rob Shuter's #ShuterScoop last month.\n\nAs the case proceeds, the family will also fight back against any recommendations for the death penalty and would prefer that Nick be offered mental help if he is eventually found guilty.\n\n\"Justice, to them, means treatment, accountability, and making sure this never happens again,\" a different source said, seemingly referencing the recent discovery of Nick's schizophrenia. \"Another death isn't justice.\"",

The college student was found dead at the bottom of an apartment complex. The Austin Police Department suggested that Aguilera took her own life, though the cheerleader's mother strongly disagreed.\n\nStephanie Rodriguez, the mother of the deceased cheerleader, ripped Austin Police for their investigation.\n\n“Please don’t believe this lazy investigator and Investigation!” Stephanie Rodriguezwrote on Facebook.\n\nNow, the parents of the cheerleader have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Austin Blacks Rugby Club and the University of Texas’ Latin Economics and Business Association. The seven-figure lawsuit accuses the two school organizations of allegedly serving their daughter alcohol before her death.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Aguilera was served her first drink around 6 p.m. She was allegedly continued to be served drinks for several hours, before stumbling away. Aguilera ended up at an apartment where she was supposed to spend the night. Ultimately, she fell to her death around midnight.\n\n“We believe even more today this was not a suicide as has been suggested by police. This was either an accident or something much more sinister,” Tony Buzbee, lead attorney with the Buzbee Law Firm, who is representing Aguilera’s parents, said at a press conference.\n\nHe added: “If the police department will not do its job, then we will do it for them.\"\n\nThe police said that they found a deleted suicide note on Aguilera's phone. However, attorneys representing Aguilera's family say that it was just a drafted essay.\n\nAn official cause of death has yet to be released. An investigation into the death remains to be underway.",

    "description": "Nearly 16,000 nurses set to join union-led strike Monday to demand large hospitals across NYC ‘put patients over profit’",
    "fullText": "Nearly 16,000 nurses in New York City are set to strike on Monday amid a battle over pay during contract negotiations.\n\nThe action, due to take place across five large hospitals, is being organized by the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA), which is demanding the hospitals put patients over profit.\n\nThe hospitals insist they continue to bargain in good faith, and have accused the union of trying to disrupt patient care.\n\nCEO compensation at three hospitals – Montefiore, Mount Sinai, and New York Presbyterian – is nearly 12,000 times more than that of the average nurse, according to the union.\n\nNancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, who has worked at Maimonides medical center in Brooklyn for over 30 years, told the Guardian that the hospitals are pushing to scale back safe staffing ratios, refusing to guarantee healthcare benefit coverage for nurses, and declining to address workplace safety issues.\n\nThree of the major hospitals involved in contract negotiations have $1.6bn cash or cash equivalent on hand, according to the union, which said they have already started hiring travel nurses to replace those striking in preparation for a strike.\n\n“What we are asking them is to take those millions and invest it into the community so we could continue to work to care for our patients, invest it into staffing, invest those millions into our medical coverage so we could come to work,” said Hagans. “We’re not taking this lightly. We’re not asking to strike. Management is the one who’s telling us that we need to strike. They are the ones putting us on the picket line.”\n\nShe cited safety issues that stem from a drastic increase of assaults on healthcare workers since the Covid-19 pandemic, and an active shooter incident at Mount Sinai last November, where three nurses were reportedly disciplined for speaking out afterwards.\n\n“The large, wealthy hospitals are much better off financially than they were three years ago, but yet they’re asking for takeaways,” claimed Hagans. “They told us to choose between our wages or keeping our healthcare and safe staffing, because we cannot have it all. The safety of a patient should never be a bargaining chip. Nurses will not cut corners on patients and their safety. Nurses are just demanding that New York City private hospitals put patients over profit.”\n\nNurses represented by NYSNA issued 10-day strike notices on 2 January at a string of New York hospitals. On Tuesday, seven of the smaller hospitals moved forward in contract negotiations, with the union rescinding their strike notice.\n\nAbout 1,000 nurses at three Northwell hospitals in Long Island have also issued strike notices.\n\n“Our nurses have been at the bargaining table since September 2025 with little to no movement,” said Simone Way, a member of the NYSNA executive committee, and a nurse at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital. “Even though we started this process in September, there have been committees in the hospital having these same discussions on staffing since January 2025, so it’s no surprise to our management the things nurses feel we need.”\n\nWay also criticized hospital management’s efforts to blame the strike on nurses, claiming they are putting patients at risk and asking for too much. “They do have the money, but they don’t appear to be willing to invest that money in their nurses or into the ability for us to provide the best care humanly possible to our patients,” she said.\n\nMount Sinai denied retaliation claims against nurses following November’s active-shooter incident, and denied attempting to take away healthcare benefits for nurses. A spokesperson said: “We are continuing to bargain in good faith in the hopes of reaching an agreement that is fair, reasonable, and responsible, but unfortunately just a week before a potential strike NYSNA has refused to move off of its extreme economic proposals that demand hospitals like ours spend billions of dollars on increased nursing compensation and additional hires.”\n\nThey claimed “most of the union’s claims about bargaining are untrue”, and confirmed that the hospital is taking steps to prepare in case of a strike.\n\nNew York Presbyterian blamed the union for not budging on wages. “NYSNA’s threatened strike is intended to disrupt patient care across the city,” a spokesperson said. “We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our patients will continue to receive safe, exceptional care. We will always meet our fundamental obligation to the communities we serve.”\n\nMontefiore did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.  Israel said the development was encouraging but “far from sufficient,\" and its Foreign Ministry said the group still has dozens of compounds and other infrastructure.  The effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.",
    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael said the development was encouraging but “far from sufficient,\" and its Foreign Ministry said the group still has dozens of compounds and other infrastructure.\n\nThe effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.\n\nThe military's statement, which did not name Hezbollah or any other armed groups, came before President Joseph Aoun met with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and his government to discuss the deployment and disarmament plans. Both said disarming non-state groups was a priority upon beginning their terms not long after the ceasefire went into effect.\n\nLebanon's top officials have endorsed the military announcement.\n\nA statement by Aoun’s office ahead of the Cabinet meeting called on Israel to stop its attacks, withdraw from areas it occupies, and release Lebanese prisoners. He called on friendly countries not to send weapons to Lebanon unless it's to state institutions — an apparent reference to Iran which for decades has sent weapons and munitions to Hezbollah.\n\nSpeaker Nabih Berri, a key ally of Hezbollah who played a leading role in ceasefire talks, issued a statement saying the people of southern Lebanon are “thirsty for the army's presence and protection.\"\n\nIsrael maintains that despite Lebanon’s efforts, Hezbollah is still attempting to rearm itself in southern Lebanon.\n\n“The ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States between Israel and Lebanon states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,\" a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office read. “This is imperative for Israel’s security and Lebanon’s future.”\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry said in a later statement that the group is “rearming faster than it is being disarmed,\" and showed a map of alleged Hezbollah compounds, launch sites, and underground networks south of the Litani River.\n\nPlan to restrict weapons at an ‘advanced stage’\n\nThe text of the ceasefire agreement is vague as to how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani River should be treated, saying Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river.\n\nHezbollah insists that the agreement only applies south of the Litani, while Israel maintains that it applies to the whole country. The Lebanese government has said it will eventually remove non-state weapons throughout the country.\n\nThe agreement is seen as a procedure to implement prior United Nations Security Council agreements that call for disarmament of non-state groups and the withdrawal of all occupying forces, and for the Lebanese state to have full control of its territory.\n\nInformation Minister Paul Morcos said after the Cabinet meeting that the army will start working on a plan for disarmament north of the Litani river that will be discussed by the government in February. He added that the army will also continue the process of weapons “containment” in other parts of Lebanon, meaning that they will not be allowed to be used or moved.\n\nThe Lebanese military has been clearing tunnels, rocket-launching positions, and other structures since its disarmament proposal was approved by the government and went into effect in September.\n\nThe government had set a deadline of the end of 2025 to clear the area south of the Litani River of non-state weapons.\n\n“The army confirms that its plan to restrict weapons has entered an advanced stage, after achieving the goals of the first phase effectively and tangibly on the ground,” the military statement read. “Work in the sector is ongoing until the unexploded ordnance and tunnels are cleared ... with the aim of preventing armed groups from irreversibly rebuilding their capabilities.”\n\nHezbollah did not immediately comment on the Lebanese announcement.\n\nOfficials have said the next stage of the disarmament plan is in segments of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which include Lebanon’s port city of Sidon, but they have not set a timeline for that phase.\n\nIsrael continues to strike Lebanon near daily and occupies five strategic hilltop points along the border, the only areas south of the Litani where the military said it has yet to control.\n\nRegular meetings have taken place between the Lebanese and the Israelis alongside the United States, France, and the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to monitor developments after the ceasefire.\n\nLebanon’s cash-strapped military has since been gradually dispersing across wide areas of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the U.N.-demarcated “Blue Line” that separates the tiny country from Israel. The military has also been slowly confiscating weapons from armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps.\n\nIsrael accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its battered military capacity and has said that the Lebanese military’s efforts are not sufficient, raising fears of a new escalation. Lebanon, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes and control of the hilltops were an obstacle to the efforts.\n\nLebanon also hopes that disarming Hezbollah and other non-state groups will help to bring in money needed for reconstruction after the 2024 war.\n\nHezbollah says it has been cooperative with the army in the south but will not discuss disarming elsewhere before Israel stops its strikes and withdraws from Lebanese territory.\n\nThe latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah, largely based in southern Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024. Israeli strikes killed much of Hezbollah's senior leadership and left the group severely weakened.\n\nHezbollah still has political clout, holding a large number of seats in parliament representing the Shiite Muslim community and two cabinet ministers.",

    "fullText": "Rangers midfielder Connor Barron is facing up to three months on the sidelines, with manager Danny Rohl lamenting a \"never-ending story\" with injury problems.\n\nBarron sustained knee ligament damage in Tuesday's 2-0 win over his former club Aberdeen.\n\nDujon Sterling, only recently back from a long term Achilles injury, is expected to miss three weeks with a muscle issue picked up in the same game.\n\nBarron, 23, has been an increasingly influential player for Rohl, with Rangers climbing up to second place in the Scottish Premiership, and the German said he would be \"a big loss\".\n\nRohl explained: \"I think he will be out around eight to 12 weeks, we speak about March, April, at the minute.\n\n\"This is football. It's a little bit like since I've been here, a never-ending story, when you have a team together and you try to grow and give them confidence and you can make the same starting 11.\n\n\"Then you have new injuries. But I think in the last couple of weeks, we did well, we always find again, a solution.\n\n\"I think it's not just Connor. The relationship with Nico (Raskin) was very special when you look on the pitch that was very fluid, that helped each other on the pitch, then in the last two games you saw as well, Dio (Mohamed Diomande), this three-man midfield was very strong.\n\n\"They dictate the rhythm, they won a lot of balls, and this is what we, of course, miss, but it's time then for maybe other players to step in and take the responsibility.\"",

    "description": "The coldest air will be short-lived. By midweek, most of Florida is expected to be back to a more normal winter weather routine.",
    "fullText": "A vigorous cold front is forecast to slide through Florida with confidence increasing that the pulse of winter chill will be felt all the way to the Keys.\n\nThe Canadian-cooled air is expected to reach the Panhandle on Sunday, Jan. 11 with wind chill temperatures possibly plummeting into the 20s during the early morning hours of Monday, Jan. 12 and daytime highs reaching only into the low 50s.\n\nIn the southern reaches of the state, low temperatures could dip into the upper 40s to mid-50s inland with the lower 60s felt along the water-warmed coasts. Daytime highs should hover around 70 degrees early in the week for much of South Florida.\n\nWhile meteorologists aren’t expecting the same slap of frigid temperatures that welcomed in the New Year — West Palm Beach got socked by a mercury reading of 39 degrees on Dec. 31 — it will be a change from more recent record-challenging heat:\n\nApalachicola sizzled at 77 degrees on Jan. 7, tying its record warm temperature set for that day in 1974.\n\nMiami reached 82 degrees, a full 6 degrees warmer than normal but below the 87-degree record set for that day in 2017.\n\nFort Pierce, on the Treasure Coast, was 84 degrees Jan. 7. That's 9 degrees above normal and near the record high of 86 set in 1990.\n\n“Everyone is talking about how warm it is and I’m thrilled with it. I love really warm weather,” said Lynn Murphy, who was working the front desk at the Driftwood Inn in the Panhandle city of Mexico Beach. “The high today (Jan. 8) is supposed to be 73 and I’m in long sleeves wishing I had a jacket.”\n\nMore: Dense fog blankets Florida: Advisories from the Panhandle to Miami\n\nThe cold front is attached to a zippy area of low pressure that will move northeast with a mix of rain and snow for areas from Michigan to Maine.\n\nRain chances increase for the western reaches of the Panhandle on Friday, Jan. 9, with up to an 80% chance of showers in Pensacola on Saturday, Jan. 10.\n\nAnd while North Florida could get whacked with temperatures in the upper 30s, the chill will moderate as it moves down the Peninsula.\n\n“Crystal River, Cedar Key, maybe Gainesville will be near the southern edge of the colder temperatures below 40 degrees,” said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. “It’s not a pure Arctic air mass but will be a return of a typical winter weather pattern.”\n\nA swirl of high pressure has dominated the southeast, pumping tropical air into more northerly latitudes, and allowing temperatures to rise. Weather gauges monitored by the Southeast Regional Climate Center have the average temperatures from Pensacola to Leesburg west of Daytona Beach at up to 9 degrees warmer than normal this month.\n\nEast coast cities from Miami to Vero Beach are still recovering from the New Year’s chill with temperatures between 1 and 2 degrees below normal since Jan. 1.\n\n“This won’t be like what we saw last time,\" said Miami-based National Weather Service meteorologist George Rizzuto trying to temper expectations. “We will see slightly reduced humidity and slightly reduced temperatures. The parent cyclone is going to be too far to the northeast.”\n\nThe coldest air will be short-lived. By midweek, most of Florida is expected to be back to a more normal winter weather routine.\n\nKimberly Miller is a journalist for the USA TODAY NETWORK FLORIDA.

    "description": "NFL analyst Phoebe Schecter gives her predictions as this season's play-offs begin with Wildcard Weekend.",
    "fullText": "This season's NFL play-offs begin at the weekend and here BBC columnist Phoebe Schecter gives her predictions for the six games on Wildcard Weekend.\n\nAll kick-off times GMT, Conference seed in brackets\n\nLos Angeles Rams (5) @ Carolina Panthers (4) - 21:30\n\nThis is a rematch from week 13, but I don't think it's fair to look at that 31-28 win for the Panthers. They managed to stay alive in the play-off hunt but their defence has kind of been the reason they've stayed in most of their games, rather than their quarterback Bryce Young.\n\nThe Rams are one of the Super Bowl favourites and I think their defence is going to be the final nail in the coffin for Carolina.\n\nMatt Stafford is one of the leading MVP contenders and Puka Nacua leads the league for receptions. He's just so physical in taking contested catches. His one-handed catches are incredible.\n\nThe Rams have struggled in the red zone in recent weeks without Davante Adams but he's set to come back so, for me, it's a clear Rams win.\n\nGreen Bay Packers (7) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 01:00 Sun\n\nThis is going to be awesome. They're divisional rivals and it's the NFL's oldest rivalry, so there's so much familiarity. That's what makes it so exciting.\n\nThey've played each other twice in the last five weeks and they're 1-1. The Packers almost beat the Bears in week 16, and that was after Micah Parsons' injury and being without Jordan Love for most of the game (concussion).\n\nCaleb Williams is doing such a great job with his game management, his athleticism, the way the ball just jumps out of his hand, and his receivers are coming together, so I have the Bears on this one.\n\nThey have had the most fourth-quarter comebacks in a season (six) and their defence leads the league with 33 takeaways. They'll probably need to get a couple more against Jordan Love to really seal the deal.\n\nLive text commentary on all play-off games on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live radio commentary on selected games on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. The Whole 10 Yards, BBC Sport's weekly NFL programme, will also follow the road to Super Bowl 60\n\nBuffalo Bills (6) @ Jacksonville Jaguars (3) - 18:00\n\nWith Kansas City, Cincinnati and Baltimore not in the play-offs, this is the clearest route to the Super Bowl the Bills have had, but this is a scary Jags team.\n\nThey've won their last eight, so they're the team that has momentum. They're having fun out there, and we've never seen this version of Trevor Lawrence before, the way he's finishing in the red zone. He looks so confident.\n\nThe Jags have been clicking on all three phases since their bye week. They brought in Jakobi Myers and the Bills have to stop Travis Etienne running all over them.\n\nBut I still have so much faith in Josh Allen. We've seen it so many times, where he comes to life in the fourth quarter, and it's hard to bet against him. So I'm going for my Bills, especially because I'll be working at the game – and I can't stand the thought of them losing!\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (6) @ Philadelphia Eagles (3) - 21:30\n\nGiven their injuries, coach Kyle Shanahan has been incredible to get the 49ers where they are. They have done a great job of staying afloat with their defence, but I just don't know how sustainable it is.\n\nHaving slipped from potentially the top seed to the sixth, Shanahan's been like 'we've just got to do it the hard way'. This must mean so much to them because of the 2023 NFC Championship game in Philly, when Brock Purdy got injured and Christian McCaffrey had to play quarterback.\n\nI don't think the Eagles are going to do anything fancy. They're going to run the ball, get the play-action to throw outside to their receivers and then play great defence.\n\nIt's not cute, it's not exciting, but they just know how to win. I have a lot of faith in Jalen Hurts and their defence, so I'm going Eagles.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (7) @ New England Patriots (2) - 01:00 Mon\n\nPlaying at New England is tough in the cold and I think that makes a big difference. I don't know how much further the Patriots will go, but I think they'll win this.\n\nJustin Herbert's been hit so many times. The Chargers' offensive line has just not been able to protect him. Like the Bills, their receivers haven't been able to get separation. It's like Herbert's the magic man again, whereas at least the Patriots have some receivers, and Drake Maye has been phenomenal.\n\nI think he's earned the MVP because it's a great story. He's with a franchise that's not been itself since Tom Brady left and it's unbelievable what he's done in his second year.\n\nYou can only say their schedule has been easy so many times. You still have to beat the teams in front of you, and he's been decisive, he's stepping up in the pocket and the way he throws the ball is beautiful.\n\nWhy the NFL play-offs are the 'most unusual' in years\n\nHouston Texans (5) @ Pittsburgh Steelers (4) - 01:00 Tue\n\nThe Steelers' win on Sunday was wild, but I think we have the same conversation around them every year. Mike Tomlin's done a great job, they've got a winning record again and got to the play-offs, but for so long it's not been more than that.\n\nI'm going for the Texans because of their defence, it's just ferocious. Danielle Hunter has 15 sacks, Will Anderson is second in the NFL with a career-high 85 QB pressures, and they have four players with four interceptions. That's a crazy stat - which of their defensive backs do you throw towards?\n\nAaron Rodgers is doing tons trying to get the Steelers' offence on the same page but they're still having miscues. DK Metcalf is back from suspension but I just don't see them having enough firepower to compete with this defence.\n\nIt's the main reason the Texans could make it deep into the play-offs. They can cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The FA Cup is still the greatest cup competition in the world and the third round is still a special weekend in the football calendar but, speaking from a manager's perspective, it has become more complicated over the years than it used to be.\n\nThe Premier League now overrides the fixture schedule, and I'm afraid the importance of the FA Cup has diminished somewhat because of that, especially when your club's top-flight status and entire financial footing is at stake.\n\nLike most things in life today, money talks and the Premier League without doubt now does most of the talking.\n\nWith three European league competitions as well, and the number of games and teams involved there, the FA Cup has fallen even further down the pecking order.\n\nWith the number of games now being played, something has to give and it is usually the FA Cup. As a manager, I understood why - even though I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when it was considered very special by everyone - and this year will be no different.\n\nAfter a busy festive period and another round of games in midweek this week, the games this weekend will be looked on by the Premier League teams as a chance to rest some of their players, and in some cases all of them!\n\nIt's sad to see, even if it could lead to opportunities for smaller clubs to join the band of giantkillers which the competition has become famous for down the years.\n\nI have experienced both sides of the coin. When we were promoted to the Premier League in 2008, Stoke initially struggled and at the turn of the year, when we came to a third-round tie at League One side Hartlepool, I changed practically the whole team.",

But manager John Rooney said recent events have put things into perspective.\n\nRooney took it upon himself to contact every member of the squad when the news was confirmed.\n\n\"Nothing can prepare you for that,\" Rooney told BBC Sport. \"When you have to ring every player individually and tell them, I can't explain what it felt like.\n\n\"I wanted to take that on.

    "fullText": "An imagined moment gave Prince Naseem Hamed the vision of what reality could have been.\n\nThe reconciliation with Brendan Ingle which never occurred is a pivotal part of Giant, the biopic about the pair.\n\nA regret the former world champion has learned to live with is that he never got the chance to make peace in person with his trainer and mentor.\n\n\"I always wanted that to happen,\" Hamed, now 51, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But to see it unfold in front of me like it could have happened... I actually said to the director and the producer: 'I only wish that that last scene was really true, because I would have wanted that'.\n\n\"Because I was with him for like 18 years.\"\n\nGiant, the new film starring Pierce Brosnan and Amir El-Masry, retells the coach and fighter's relationship. The story charts Hamed's rise from a seven-year-old growing up in Sheffield to a multi-millionaire global superstar under Ingle's guidance.\n\nThe movie, released in UK cinemas on 9 January, delves into how Hamed became a world featherweight champion by 21 and then the fallout with the Ireland-born coach later on.\n\nTheir relationship became strained as Hamed and his family grew irritated by the trainer's agreed 25% cut of his fight purses as they started to become big numbers.\n\nThen a 1998 book, The Paddy and The Prince, written by Nick Pitt, completely soured the relationship. They split not long after Hamed's win over Wayne McCullough in the same year. It was a bitter parting.\n\nAs years passed and Hamed's career finished, he tried \"many times\" to reconnect with Ingle but the legendary trainer did not want to meet.\n\nIn 2018, Ingle died aged 77 and Hamed never got the chance to make amends. He could only deliver a public tribute to the man who had helped him reach the top of the world.\n\n\"He didn't want to have that final kind of meeting and to have to clear the air with it,\" Hamed said.\n\n\"If I was to say to you that there's no regret and I don't care, I'd be lying. Because I've got a heart and I felt like I started at the age of seven with him.\n\n\"He laid down the fundamentals and he taught me stuff from a very young age that I can never just not include - I can't say it was on my own and it was just a God-given talent.\n\n\"I have to mention him in a good way, not because I have to, because I want to.\"",

    "fullText": "Our fitness expert clocked up his indoor miles to put the best exercise bikes, including simple spin machines and gym-quality models, to the test\n\nThe best treadmills for your home, tested\n\nCycling has the potential to benefit your health in myriad ways, whether it’s the mood-boosting properties of inhaling fresh air, the social element of riding with friends or the simple act of improving cardiovascular fitness with every pedal stroke.\n\nThe UK weather doesn’t always play ball, though, so for those who don’t want a dire forecast to result in a missed workout, indoor training replicates the exercise (if not the fresh air).\n\nThe best exercise bikes are not only fantastic for burning a few calories without donning all the outdoor gear, but they can also help you nail training goals if you’re a more serious rider. With many letting you connect your phone or laptop to make the most of online training tools, it’s never been easier or more enjoyable to work out from your home.\n\nI tested 12 exercise bikes, including the sort you might find in a commercial gym, along with more dedicated riding simulators and recumbent models for those who find it tricky to sit hunched forward for any length of time. The resulting list features those that I think performed best.\n\nWhile I’ve tried to appeal to a wide range of budgets, it’s difficult to recommend much under the £500 mark because the build quality of these cheaper models is often not worth the investment.\n\nBest exercise bike overall:\n\n Peloton Bike+\n\nBest budget exercise bike for beginners:\n\n Horizon 3.0SC indoor cycle\n\nBest compact exercise bike:\n\n Wattbike Proton\n\nBest gym-quality exercise bike: \n\n Technogym bike\n\nBest recumbent exercise bike:\n\n LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycle\n\nWhile I no longer compete in official cycling events, I still consider myself a keen cyclist, often heading out with friends on a gravel bike, even if those rides now end in a warm pub, rather than a timed finish line. But when the weather isn’t playing ball, I’ll get stuck into a home- or gym-based exercise bike session to keep fit and stay in shape for when cycling season comes back around again.\n\nHaving tested exercise equipment for numerous publications, I’m always one to get stuck in and test a product for as long as possible. With exercise bikes, this meant getting plenty of hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\n\nExercise bikes are bulky items that typically require an element of setup or construction. To make testing so many of them viable, I either borrowed a pre-assembled machine for one or two weeks or tested the bikes in a dedicated boutique or workout space.\n\nDuring each test, I used any workout modes that were available, syncing a smartphone or laptop to take advantage of third-party software or online classes, if these were offered. The machines were judged on their build quality, features, ease of setup and storage (some companies offer premium white glove deliveries), as well as the overall adjustability or suitability for numerous members of the household.\n\nAfter slipping into a pair of fetching cycling shoes, I assessed noise levels with a smartphone-based decibel meter, and made more subjective assessments on the general ride feel, comfort and the overall quality of the workout experience.\n\nMany rivals have attempted to imitate Peloton, but few have managed to nail its overall experience. Above all, the brand is unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes, offering so many options – from a quick 15-minute spin class to hardcore sportive training, and all led by motivating instructors and accompanied by thumping soundtracks.\n\nThe Bike+ is the premium one of the brand’s two exercise bikes and has a 23.8in (huge!) high-definition display, which can be rotated for workouts that involve movements off the machine. There’s also an automatic resistance knob that adjusts to match the levels recommended by instructors during classes.\n\nIt’s expensive, with a £45-a-month “all access” membership fee on top, but for engaging, interactive workouts pitched at a wide range of users, nothing else comes close.\n\nWhy we love it\nAlthough the Bike+ isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as some of its rivals, it’s comfortable, easy to adjust and not too imposing in any room. It also has wheels, so it is relatively easy to tip on its end and move around.\n\nThe touchscreen on the Bike+ is of excellent quality and the sound from its built-in speakers is impressive, but it’s the array of classes that makes Peloton so alluring. Unlike many rivals, which can feel prescribed, mundane and overly technical, Peloton somehow makes a gruelling 45-minute spin session feel enjoyable.\n\nThe weighted flywheel and belt-drive system are quiet enough to not disturb others in the household, although hardcore road cyclists will probably balk at the Bike+ for its lack of cycling realism and the bouncy, frenetic spin-class nature of many of its workouts.\n\nIt doesn’t play nicely with third-party cycling apps – such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad – either, so, if that’s important to you, look at the Wattbike Proton below instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t feel as realistic as some rivals, and there’s a monthly fee to access the classes and features\n\nDimensions: 56 x 137 x 152cm (WLH) \nWeight: 65kg \nDrivetrain: belt-drive with magnetic, digital resistance adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5, ANT+, wifi (2.4GHz and 5GHz)\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg \nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, 23.8in rotating HD touchscreen with Peloton classes, Netflix, Disney+ and more\n\nAt the time of writing, the Horizon 3.0SC Indoor Cycle cost £569.99, making it one of the cheapest exercise bikes I tested. But it certainly doesn’t feel cheap or any less capable than many of the other exercise bikes I poured sweat upon.\n\nThe 3.0SC has an ultra-smooth, front-mounted flywheel that uses electronically adjustable magnetic resistance to provide 32 effort levels. All of this is controlled via a funky and futuristic-looking digital dial that responds quickly to inputs – great for jumping out of the saddle during high-intensity efforts.\n\nAlthough this is predominantly designed for use in spin classes, its ergonomically cushioned seat and easy-adjust handlebars make it a comfortable spot to pedal away the hours. Oh, and it’s whisper-quiet too, registering just 32dB during my testing.\n\nIt may not be the sort of thing I’d use to train for an upcoming cycling sportive, but it’s a well-priced tool for hitting daily fitness goals.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe 3.0SC looks great. It even blasts out eight vibrant colours from its flywheel, depending on the RPM and amount of effort you are putting in, adding a bit of Tron-like sci-fi to any room.\n\nAnd aside from its relatively compact proportions and lightweight build, the bike is also well connected, playing nicely with Zwift, Kinomap and other third-party fitness apps. There are more realistic-feeling bikes out there, but if you swap out the pedals for a dedicated clipless system, it’s a fairly convincing road bike. Space between the cranks, for example, is as narrow as possible, making it ride like a genuine road machine.\n\nIf you’re looking for on-demand fitness classes, you can find these via Horizon’s free atZone workout app. Pair your phone or tablet with the bike, mount it to the secure plastic holder at the front of the bars, and you’re good to go. For a free service, there’s an impressive amount of content, and it’ll track your progress over time.\n\nIt’s a shame that … there isn’t an integrated display, meaning you’ll have to bring a tablet or smartphone for any instructor-led workouts.\n\nDimensions: 52 x 107 x 120cm (WLH) \nWeight: 36kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with ECB (eddy current) magnetic, electronic resistance (32 levels)\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5 (FTMS compatible for app integration) \nFolding: no (but features transport wheels)\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 100kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder and syncs with training apps\n\nWattbike is probably best known for its original red, white and black Air bike machines, which can be found in gyms and health clubs up and down the country. The company has since ventured into home-workout territory, and the Proton sits somewhere in the middle of its range, offering a lightweight, compact footprint and support for popular third-party training apps, including Zwift and TrainingPeaks.\n\nRacy looks and confusing workout programmes may risk putting off more casual users, but the Proton is designed to appeal to all of the family – comfortably adjusting for those between 4ft 6in and 6ft 6in tall. It’s not as quiet as some of its rivals, but the Proton feels realistic to ride and even has an auto-adjusting ergometer mode (ERG), so it can simulate gradients and gear changes without you having to lift a finger.\n\nWhy we love it\nWattbike has done an admirable job in retaining a realistic bike feel on such a lightweight and compact machine, with a fully adjustable seat post, saddle and handlebars that make it easy to set up to your requirements. I was able to quickly swap the standard toe-cage pedals for some Shimano clipless ones, which improved my performance and gave me greater control over pedal stroke. Most exercise bikes will allow you to swap the pedals, which takes about five minutes if you have the correct spanner or hex key. Adding cleats and pedals allows you to don a dedicated cycling shoe, which provides better power transfer between the legs and pedals compared with basic adjustable toe cages.\n\nWattbike’s background in working with pro athletes is evident from the Wattbike Hub app, which offers real-time feedback on pedal stroke and efficiency, among other nerdy data fields. The app has been tweaked to appeal to the more casual fitness fanatic, but it’s far from friendly to beginners, and you won’t find the same interactivity you would with a Peloton class. It’s more a case of following graphs and on-screen warnings about form than watching live demos from a bubbly personal trainer.\n\nHowever, there are still plenty of workouts aimed at improving overall health rather than targeting highly trained athletes. And, if you like, you can always mount your iPad in the dedicated holder and binge television or complete a virtual workout session of your choice: the Proton’s Bluetooth FTMS technology means it will work with most third-party apps, such as Zwift, TrainerRoad and Rouvy.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the app isn’t slicker and with more to entice and retain a novice.\n\nDimensions: 57 x 102 x 127cm (WLH)\nWeight: 48kg\nDrivetrain: chain drive with electromagnetic resistance\nMaximum power output: 1,800W\nSimulated grade: up to +25% incline\nConnectivity: ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration)\nFolding: no; includes front transport wheels for ease of movement\nNoise level: about 40dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder\n\nTechnogym has been steadily raising the bar when it comes to smart fitness equipment, with a growing line of connected kit that aims to bring the personal trainer experience to your own home.\n\nClearly designed to take on the likes of Peloton, the Technogym Bike is a stylish machine with a 22in high-definition touchscreen that allows access to a raft of Technogym’s live and on-demand content.\n\nIts compact, svelte frame looks and feels as if it’s aimed at more serious cyclists than Peloton’s offering, and the ride experience is smoother and slightly more natural than its rival. There’s plenty of adjustability for different-size riders, while the included double-sided pedals allow for use with trainers or SPD cycling shoes (a clipless shoe system).\n\nThe built-in screen is crisp and easy to navigate, granting access to entertainment apps, including YouTube and Netflix. It rotates to allow for off-bike sessions, too. However, it’s among the most expensive models I tested, and there’s a further membership fee, starting at £8.99 a month. Ouch.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe riding experience is comfortable without straying too far from a realistic simulation, while the powerful flywheel offers punishing levels of resistance. Technogym has live classes, as with Peloton, but it also appeals to the more hardcore athlete with dedicated training programmes geared towards those with ambitions of tackling the Col de Turini.\n\nIf you’re seeking the best in terms of design and build quality – and your bank balance permits the luxury – you’ll be happy with this bike. It’s a handsome, well-built machine that straddles the line between a dedicated cycling trainer and a spin bike well.\n\nIt also works with most third-party training apps and syncs up neatly with Apple Fitness and Apple Watch via a quick-tap NFC panel. For those totally dedicated to Lycra, Technogym offers an even more expensive Ride model, which feels built to compete with Wattbike and Wahoo’s most serious offerings.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it costs so much, and then Technogym charges yet more for a monthly membership.\n\nDimensions: 59 x 121 x 138cm (WLH)\nWeight: 67kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with magnetic resistance (20 levels)\nSimulated grade: not specified\nConnectivity: supports streaming via external device (eg Chromecast, Fire TV Stick); Apple Watch pairing; Technogym Live integration and third-party apps\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 160kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, rotating display with ability to stream apps (TV shows, movies, games, etc) via smartphone, tablet or laptop\n\nRecumbent bikes are great for those who experience back pain, struggle with past injuries or simply find it daunting or uncomfortable to be perched atop a traditional exercise bike for any length of time. You can achieve the same, low-impact cardio workout while enjoying a more relaxed seating position that takes the pressure off the lower back, leg joints and neck.\n\nLifeFitness is a reputable brand that supplies commercial gym equipment and kit more suited for use at home, with the RS3 sitting between the two. For the money, you get a comfortable, ergonomically fitted seat with backrest, 20 levels of resistance and a step-through design that makes it easy to get on and off. There’s also plenty of adjustment in the seat to get the perfect workout position.\n\nAlthough larger than many more traditional exercise bikes, it can be lifted and moved because of its transport wheels.\n\nWhy we love it\nMore seasoned riders will probably find a recumbent bike a little too laidback, since it’s difficult to transfer maximum power through the cranks from the more relaxed seating position. That said, it’s not really designed for smashing PBs – it’s best placed for longer, low-intensity steady-state cardio sessions.\n\nIt links to Rouvy, Zwift and a bunch of other third-party fitness apps, but the digital offering is otherwise basic, with a handful of built-in and customisable workouts direct from the console. Users can also pair an Apple or Samsung Galaxy Watch for heart-rate tracking and more.\n\nSome recumbent bikes can feel decidedly budget, but that’s not the case here. With excellent build quality and a smooth and quiet ride experience, the RS3 is a comfortable place to work up a sweat without the associated aches and pains.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the Track Connect 2.0 Console is fiddly to use, and there’s no built-in multimedia.\n\nDimensions: 68 x 164 x 131cm (WLH)\nWeight: 69.8kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive magnetic resistance, manual adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth FTMS and NFC for syncing with apps, wireless HR receiver\nFolding: no\nNoise level: under 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 181kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no, 7in LCD display with Track Connect Console allowing external tablet/smartphone streaming and app integration\n\nIf you’re mad for virtual cycling apps such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad, or simply want to replicate that road cycling feel at home, Wahoo’s Kickr Shift is among the best indoor training tools for enthusiasts.\n\nThe saddle, stem height and reach can all easily be adjusted on the fly, and users can even select their desired crank length. Heck, the bike even simulates several electronically assisted gearing group sets from Shimano and Campagnolo, mimicking the way the cogs feel when shifting under load.\n\nIt’s a wonderfully quiet, smooth and powerful machine that works perfectly with dedicated cycling training apps. For those who like to reach for the chamois cream at the weekend, this is the perfect indoor companion.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the Wattbike Proton feels like a slightly more rounded machine for all the family.\n\nDimensions: 78 x 140 x 110cm (WLH); weight: 36kg; drivetrain: belt drive with electromagnetic resistance; maximum power output: 2,200W; simulated grade: +20% incline, -15% decline; connectivity: ANT+, ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth, wifi, Direct Connect; folding: no; noise level: under 30dB; maximum user weight: 113kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen; requires external device for app/display\n\nBest for: a studio spin bike feel at home\n\nAnother Peloton Bike+ rival, NordicTrack’s indoor trainer is an excellent spinning machine for a smooth yet powerful ride, with a solid dose of realistic-feeling resistance that will feel tough even for seasoned cyclists. It also comes with a whopping 24in touchscreen for immersive online sessions.\n\nGranted, the iFit virtual training environment doesn’t quite compete with the Hollywood sheen of a Peloton class, but it gets mightily close, and the physical bike feels accomplished and more modern than Peloton’s slightly frumpy-looking machine.\n\nIts 20% incline to -10% simulated decline means it also doubles up as an excellent and quite realistic road or mountain biking training tool, with interactive videos that allow you to virtually cycle around some of the most beautiful places on Earth.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … iFit just isn’t up to Peloton’s offering, and the multimedia setup isn’t quite as slick.\n\nDimensions: 55 x 143 x 159cm (WLH); weight: 81kg; drivetrain: silent magnetic resistance, 24 digital levels; simulated grade: +20% incline/-10% decline; connectivity: Bluetooth (headphone & HR monitor), wifi (for iFit), USB-C port, app integration via iFit (syncs with Strava, Garmin, Google Fit, Apple Health); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 24in pivoting HD touchscreen with built-in speakers, iFit streaming of workouts, classes, and entertainment apps\n\nBest for: a recumbent bike on a budget\n\nOffering a cheaper alternative to the LifeFitness recumbent above, Schwinn’s more basic model majors in comfort and adjustability but wraps it up in a slightly lighter and cheaper-feeling frame.\n\nThe 5.5in segmented LCD screen takes care of the basics, with several built-in workouts to get you going. And there’s always the option to pair a tablet or smartphone and make use of Zwift and other digital training apps.\n\nIt represents excellent value for money, but don’t expect the same sort of build quality as pricier rivals; the handle-mounted heart-rate monitor was hugely inaccurate during my testing, and there are some cheap plastic covers masking some of the fastening bolts. On that subject, don’t expect a white glove delivery service with something at this price.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s not quite as robust as rivals, and the built-in heart-rate monitor was way out during tests.\n\nDimensions: 69 x 163 x 113cm (WLH); weight: 37kg; drivetrain: belt-driven flywheel with 16 levels of manual magnetic resistance; simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration); wireless heart-rate compatibility (strap not included); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 136kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen for media; includes a 5.5in LCD console (for metrics and programmes) and a media shelf for tablets\n\nBest for: a gym-quality upright bike\n\nThis model treads the line between a serious studio bike, such as the Peloton Bike+ or NordicTrack X24, and something more relaxed. It has a comfy padded seat, oversized self-balancing pedals and a unique handlebar design that allows for multiple hand positions. Despite the upright positioning, the ride feel is realistic, and there are 30 levels of resistance to contend with.\n\nIt’s expensive, given that the XUR digital console isn’t as good as those from Technogym, Peloton and NordicTrack, but this is a solid, reliable and comfortable bit of kit from one of the biggest names in commercial gym equipment.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s an expensive bike with a less impressive digital offering than cheaper rivals.\n\nDimensions: 63 x 122 x 143cm (WLH); weight: 60kg; drivetrain: Exact Force induction brake (electronically adjustable resistance); simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: wifi (entertainment apps, software updates), Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration, HR monitor, headphones), HDMI port, USB (media and charging); folding: no, includes transport wheels; noise level: about 28dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 22in HD touchscreen with apps including Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, web browser, social media, plus tablet/HDMI mirroring\n\nExercise bikes vary wildly in price, with the cheapest models often taking the form of basic upright or spin bikes that focus purely on pedalling, and the most expensive offering large HD touchscreens, automatic resistance adjustments and fully integrated training platforms.\n\nBudget models typically start at £250-£400, but often lack the build quality and adjustability needed for long-term use. At the other end of the spectrum, premium connected bikes – such as those from Peloton, Technogym and NordicTrack – can set you back £2,000 or more, and often require monthly subscriptions on top for interactive classes.\n\nFor most riders, a budget of between £600 and £1,200 is a good place to start for solid build quality, smooth resistance and decent connectivity features without straying into commercial-gym territory.\n\nEven the most compact exercise bikes take up space, with the smallest options measuring about 55 x 120 x 130cm (WLH). While that’s less floor space than a treadmill or cross trainer, you’ll still need clearance around the bike for safe mounting and dismounting, as well as enough ceiling height to remain comfortable when standing on the pedals.\n\nRecumbent bikes, which offer a chair-like riding position, often require more floor space, while upright and indoor cycles are more compact. It might be tempting to look at folding exercise bikes, but they can often be flimsy and offer weak pedal resistance.\n\nThe most important thing is the resistance system: magnetic resistance is smoother, quieter and requires less maintenance than older friction-based systems found on traditional studio spin bikes. Belt-drive systems are also preferable to chain-driven units for their silent, low-maintenance operation.\n\nAdjustability is another key factor – a bike with multiple saddle and handlebar positions will ensure better ergonomics and comfort over long sessions, and it will also fit more members of the household.\n\nFor those who want to stay entertained, connected bikes with integrated screens and app compatibility (Zwift, Peloton, iFit, etc) can make training more engaging. Heart-rate monitoring and Bluetooth/ANT+ connectivity are also useful for tracking progress.\n\nFinally, noise levels are worth considering, especially if you live in a flat or plan to exercise when everyone else is sleeping. Modern magnetic systems are whisper-quiet, making them perfect for shared living spaces.\n\nLeon Poultney has been a consumer technology and automotive journalist for longer than he cares to divulge.

    "fullText": "From cosy museums and tropical islands to nightmarishly difficult adventures – and revamps of favourites including Mario Kart and Pokémon – there’s something for everyone\n\nNintendo’s newest console has been out for a less than a year but it already boasts an impressive catalogue of excellent new games, as well as a variety of enhanced Switch greats. Here’s our selection of the 15 best titles currently on offer, ranging from family favourites to grittier, more adult challenges.\n\nOriginally released in 2020, Nintendo’s lovable life simulator has you cast away on a tropical island, building a home, making friends and inviting other players around for a cup of tea. The new version for Switch 2 (available 15 January) overhauls the visuals and multiplayer connectivity, as well as adding support for the Switch 2 camera.\n\nWhy we love it: “Your days are spent chasing bugs, chopping wood, arranging furniture and watering flowers, not scrounging for food/water/weapons and fighting people.” Read more.\n\nThe beloved ape teams up with his previous kidnap victim Pauline (no hard feelings, obviously) in this literally smashing subterranean adventure. The rules of the platform genre are cast aside as walls and floors are pulverised by Kong’s massive fists.\n\nWhy we love it: “I can see Bananza having a second life as an executive stress reliever; a virtual rage room where you heave exploding boulders at cliffs to reduce them to pockmarked swiss cheese.” Read the full review.\n\nOriginally released in 1997, Final Fantasy Tactics was a battle-focused take on the role-playing adventure series, cutting exploration in favour of tense, contained fight scenes. The Ivalice Chronicles features updated visuals as well as fresh voice acting and difficulty levels, perfectly modernising a PlayStation classic.\n\nWhy we love it: “[It] offers a model for resistance, and also a commentary on the struggle of opposition in such turbulent times.” Read the full review.\n\nThe sequel to 2020’s brilliant mythological action game brings us new lead character Melinoë, a witch who must defeat the god of time and his retinue of sexy, chaotic boss characters. As before, dying returns you to the beginning, but you always reanimate and begin again, lessons learned and experience gained.\n\nWhy we love it: “[Jen] Zee’s new character illustrations are, if anything, likely to inspire even more aggressively thirsty fan art and fanfic. And writer Greg Kasavin’s wonderful script is wittier, wiser and flirtier than ever.” Read the full review.\n\nOne of the biggest hits of 2025, this platform adventure sequel drags insectoid princess Hornet into the haunted realm of Pharloom, where relentless enemies and fiendishly tough puzzles await. Nightmarishly difficult and compelling, it’s up there with the greatest Metroidvania titles of all time.\n\nWhy we love it: “I’m captivated by Silksong. I’ve spent 15 hours on it in three days, and it has made my thumbs hurt.” Read more.\n\nThe first 3D platforming adventure for Hal Laboratory’s long-running hero sees Kirby wake up in a magical world terrorised by a gang of animals known as the Beast Pack. The Switch 2 edition updates the visuals and adds a whole new story.\n\nWhy we love it: “From scaling overgrown tower blocks to navigating ghost-ridden haunted house rides in a creature-infested theme park, it feels endlessly inventive.” Read the full review.\n\nThe follow-up to 2017’s Breath of the Wild returns us to the world of Hyrule, now shattered by a cataclysmic event. Familiar locations are radically changed, fresh secrets and quests are revealed, and a new physics engine lets you build incredible contraptions.\n\nWhy we love it: “The sense of freedom here is intoxicating. The kingdom of Hyrule is vast and full of diversions, and being able to move freely between the skies and the ground down below is a thrill that never wears off.” Read the full review.\n\nA new beginning for Nintendo’s beloved karting series sees a vast open world to race in, alongside gorgeous circuits, cars, characters and abilities. Implementation of the Switch 2’s GameChat system makes online play more sociable – and the music is incredible.\n\nWhy we love it: “It really is an impressively welcoming game, this, generous and detailed and unfailingly fun, different but with the same spirit.” Read the full review.\n\nArguably one of the greatest first-person sci-fi shooters ever made, Metroid Prime was a huge hit on the GameCube in 2002 before receiving a wonderful remaster on the Switch. Series hero Samus Aran finds herself on the poisoned planet of Tallon IV, exploring its haunted biomes and fighting hideous space creatures. Inspired by Ridley Scott’s Alien, it is tense, complex and often scary – things we rarely expect from a Nintendo title.\n\nWhy we love it: “Sometimes, you play a game from a decades ago and think, this might actually hit better now. Metroid Prime Remastered is one of those games.” Read more.\n\nIn the sprawling, Paris-esque Lumiose City, a team of young trainers set out to climb the ranks of the biggest Pokémon tournament in town. Arriving as an eager newcomer, you must help them – and save the city from rogue mega-evolved Pokémon. A fresh, interesting take on the series, with more lively battles, an open world to explore and, of course, hundreds of Poké-friends to make along the way.\n\nWhy we love it: “It looks better than every other Pokémon game I’ve played, and if I could show this to my 11-year-old self playing on a monochrome Game Boy screen, she’d lose her mind.” Read more.\n\nIn the early days of the Apple App Store, Swedish studio Simogo made some of the most fascinating, beautifully designed touchscreen games of all time, from rhythm action platformers to folk horror adventures. This collection brings them all together with extra features, including early prototypes of the games.\n\nWhy we love it: “These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.” Read the full review.\n\nImagine Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, but set in a demonic underworld that you must escape by rolling through bizarre crystalline hellscapes while pulling off bodacious moves. A surreal and spiritual take on the skating sim.\n\nWhy we love it: “Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious ‘gamefeel’ of the actual skateboarding.” Read the full review.\n\nTwo authors – one writing sci-fi, the other fantasy – are sucked into their own stories when a virtual reality machine goes awry. From the makers of the award-winning It Takes Two, this is another cooperative adventure in which players work in tandem to solve ingenious puzzles.\n\nWhy we love it: “One level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns.” Read more.\n\nThe warriors return for another showdown, featuring classic combatants and new fighters, such as drunken boxer Jamie and graffiti ninja Kimberly. The special moves are eye-popping and the gorgeous, hyper-colourful visuals hit you harder than Ryu’s hadouken.\n\nWhy we love it: “It’s bursting at the seams with things to do, assured in its gameplay, and wrapped in a stylish, colourful, confident swagger that the game can absolutely back up.” Read the full review.\n\nDesign the perfect museum then send out explorers to discover artefacts in the latest management game from the makers of the equally great Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. The simulation is complex and demanding but it’s softened by lovely comic touches.\n\nWhy we love it: “Takes all the lessons from the previous games and builds on them to make a thoughtful and hugely entertaining contribution to the management sim genre.” Read the full review.",

    "fullText": "Jan. 8 (UPI) -- Carson Beck took a deep breath and delivered a simple message to Miami teammates Thursday before leading a game-winning drive against Ole Miss and clinching a spot in the College Football Playoff finale:\n\n\"We've got three minutes for the rest of our lives.\"\n\nThe sixth-year quarterback finished the Hurricanes' final drive with his first rushing score since September. The 3-yard run, which came with 19 seconds remaining, lifted the Hurricanes to a 31-27 Fiesta Bowl victory and into their first national title game since 2003.\n\n\"I'm so proud of this team,\" said Beck, who threw for 268 yards and two scores. \"We never flinched in the face of adversity. When we had to respond, we responded.\"\n\nCARSON BECK TAKES THE LEAD FOR THE CANES IN THE NICK OF TIME pic.twitter.com/5ZuJlwISkX— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 9, 2026\n\nThe No. 10 Hurricanes (13-2) and No. 6 Rebels (13-2) exchanged the lead six times, including four times in the fourth quarter of the electric College Football Playoff semifinal in Glendale, Ariz. Neither team led by more than seven points.\n\nBeck's Hurricanes, who dominated time of possession in the first half, nearly unraveled due to dropped passes, penalties and an overall lack of discipline down the stretch, but found chemistry when it mattered most.\n\nThey will battle the top-ranked Indiana Hoosiers or No. 5 Oregon Ducks, the other two semifinalists, for a chance to claim their sixth national crown.\n\n\"We are focused on enjoying this one, but we've gotta get focused on going 1-0 one more time,\" Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal said.\n\nThe Hurricanes out-gained the Rebels 459 to 398 in total yards and held an edge in time of possession of nearly 22 minutes, but also committed 10 penalties and logged the game's lone turnover.\n\nPowerful Hurricanes trench play, with dominant defensive and offensive line performances, muted Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and the Rebels' previously potent offense throughout the first two quarters.\n\nCarter Davis split the uprights for a 38-yard field goal on the Hurricanes' first drive of the night for the only points of the first quarter. Rebels running back Kewan Lacy then gutted the Hurricanes defense with a career-long 73-yard touchdown run 10 seconds into the second quarter.\n\nBut Lacy, who picked up a hamstring injury, didn't see another carry in the first half. Hurricanes running back CharMar Brown scored on a 4-yard run to end the next drive.\n\nRebels kicker Lucas Carneiro tied the score with a 42-yard field goal on the next possession, but the Hurricanes answered with their second score of the night. That score -- a 52-yard pass from Beck to wide receiver Keelan Marion -- and an extra point gave a 17-10 lead for the Hurricanes.\n\nCarneiro made a 58-yard kick just before halftime to cut the deficit to four points at the break.\n\nDavis and Carneiro each missed 51-yard kicks on the first two drives of the second half. Rebels safety Kapena Gushiken snatched a deflected pass for an interception of Beck on the next possession.\n\nCarneiro hit the left upright and bounced in another three points for the Rebels about three minutes later, trimming the deficit to 17-16.\n\nThe Rebels unearthed their pass rush at the start of the fourth quarter, picking up two sacks on the Hurricanes' first drive of the frame. They then put together their longest drive of the night, using 14 plays to get another Carneiro field goal and take back the lead with about seven minutes remaining.\n\nFreshman phenom Malachi Toney took momentum back when he caught a short pass from Beck on the next drive and revved for a 36-yard touchdown, helping the Hurricanes take a 24-19 advantage.\n\nBut Chambliss used his legs and live arm to wrestle back the advantage less than two minutes later. The Rebels quarterback threw a 24-yard dart to tight end Dae'Quan Wright for that score. He followed with a successful two-point conversion throw to wide receiver Caleb Odom for a 27-24 edge with 3:13 remaining.\n\nBeck responded by using 14 plays to get the Hurricanes to the Rebels 3-yard line. He took the next snap, scanned through progressions to his right and darted to a clear patch of grass on his left before finding the end zone with his clutch gallop.\n\nChambliss used the game's final seconds to march the Rebels deep into Hurricanes territory, but his final pass dropped incomplete as time expired.\n\nThe Rebels quarterback completed 23 of 37 passes for 277 yards and a score in the loss. Beck completed 23 of 37 passes for the Hurricanes, including seven completions to Marion, who totaled a game-high 114 yards.\n\nToney amassed 81 yards on five catches, including his touchdown. Hurricanes running back Mark Fletcher Jr. ran for 133 yards on 22 carries. Lacy totaled 103 yards and a score on 11 carries, with the majority of his production coming from his career-long sprint.\n\nOregon (13-1) will meet Indiana (14-0) in the second College Football Playoff semifinal at 7:30 p.m. EST Friday in Atlanta. The winner will face the Hurricanes in the national title game Jan. 19 in Miami Gardens, Fla.",

    "description": "Weather could make it difficult for both quarterbacks, which puts an emphasis on the running game. Maye should get more help in that regard than Justin Herbert.",
    "fullText": "Welcome back to the playoffs, New England Patriots.\n\nThe last time we saw the Patriot Way grace us this deep into January, New England got drilled in Buffalo with Mac Jones leading the way at quarterback in the 2021 season. New England's last postseason home game happened to be the last time we saw Tom Brady in a Patriots uniform, suffering an upset loss to Mike Vrabel and the Tennessee Titans in the 2019 season’s playoffs.\n\nSpeaking of Vrabel, he's back, this time in familiar digs as New England's head coach. But all eyes will be mainly focused on his quarterback, Drake Maye, who is in a tight MVP race with the Los Angeles Rams' Matthew Stafford.\n\nThe Chargers and Patriots didn’t play each other this season. The two teams matched up late in 2024 with Los Angeles winning decisively in New England, 40-7. Maye passed for only 117 yards, his worst game as a full-time starter during his rookie season.\n\nOn the other side, Justin Herbert posted the kind of performance the Chargers will need from him Sunday night. He threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns, two of those scoring passes going to Ladd McConkey, who finished with 94 yards. J.K. Dobbins (now with the Broncos) rushed for 76 yards.\n\nThe Patriots have no major injuries to deal with going into Sunday. But five players missed practice this week due to illness and the team will hope more don’t come down with a bug leading up to kickoff. For the Chargers, starting running back Omarion Hampton — the team’s second-leading rusher — hasn’t practiced all week due to an ankle issue that sidelined him for eight games this season. Edge rusher Bud Dupree has also missed practice.\n\nIt’s Michigan vs. Ohio State on the opposing sidelines.\n\nVrabel is a leading candidate for Coach of the Year honors after turning New England around from a 4-13 slog in 2024 to a 13-4 resurgence this season. He has a 3-5 playoff record, which includes the Tennessee Titans’ run to the AFC championship game in the 2019 season. Harbaugh boasts a 5-4 mark, which includes three consecutive NFC championship games with the San Francisco 49ers and an appearance in Super Bowl XLVII. Yet the Chargers lost in last season’s wild-card round, 32-12, to the Houston Texans.\n\nAs Herbert goes, so do the Chargers. Last season, he threw four interceptions in Los Angeles’ playoff defeat. This season, when he didn’t play well, the Chargers typically couldn’t overcome those poor performances. (The lone exception was Week 14’s 22-19 overtime win over the Philadelphia Eagles, in which Herbert threw for only 139 yards.) However, the Patriots may provide an ideal matchup for Herbert to shine. New England allowed 4,459 passing yards this season and 8.9 yards per throw, both worst in the AFC. And only the Bengals gave up more TD passes (36) this season than the Patriots’ 31 among conference teams.\n\nMaye has been viewed as an MVP candidate throughout the season. But he’ll face the NFL’s fourth-best pass defense (3,314 yards allowed) in the Chargers. Only two other teams had more interceptions than the 19 Los Angeles grabbed this season. So the Patriots may have to run the ball to win. That could suit them well, as they compiled the third-most rushing yards in the AFC. TreVeyon Henderson led the team with 911 yards and nine TDs. He ran for a season-high 148 yards and two scores in Week 15 versus the Bills.\n\nNew England was actually better on the road (8-0) this season than at home (6-3). But temperatures in Foxborough, Massachusetts, are expected to be in the mid-30s by Sunday’s 8 p.m. ET kickoff, which isn’t ideal for a team coming from Los Angeles.\n\nThe conditions could make it difficult for both quarterbacks, which puts an emphasis on the running game. Maye should get more help in that regard than Herbert. The Patriots’ ability to control the line of scrimmage on offense with two talented running backs capable of rushing for 100 yards could be the difference.",

    "fullText": "With Ruben Amorim gone, it will be interesting to see what happens with quite a few Manchester United players.\n\nThe former head coach had overlooked many players while openly criticising a few. Interim boss Darren Fletcher already has those players playing with a lot more freedom.\n\nCase in point — Patrick Dorgu registered an assist against Burnley, Benjamin Sesko grabbed a brace, while Manuel Ugarte impressed in the middle of the park.\n\nKobbie Mainoo came on to replace the struggling Casemiro, while Joshua Zirkzee was also summoned from the bench.\n\nThe Dutchman only started four Premier League games this season, and in one of those games (vs Wolves), he was hooked at half-time despite scoring United’s only goal of the game.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\nAmorim’s treatment had him considering a January move to AS Roma with personal terms even agreed and a contract proposal also on the table.\n\nIt seemed like a foregone conclusion, delayed only due to the absence of United’s AFCON contingent. Things are now different following the ex-Sporting CP boss’ sacking.\n\nAs per the reliable Gianluca Di Marzio, the Red Devils have blocked the Dutchman’s exit, and will only greenlight a move after a new interim manager is in place.\n\nOnce the new caretaker manager takes over, he will have the final say on the former Bologna ace’s future.\n\n“AS Roma, Zirkzee operation still blocked. Roma want to renew the attacking department available to Gian Piero Gasperini and are not limiting themselves to working for Giacomo Raspadori.\n\n“Zirkzee’s situation, however, is still on hold and will remain so until Manchester United decides on their next manager.”\n\nIt makes sense to keep the Netherlands international at the club until then as the new interim boss needs to understand the squad and whether letting a forward go will leave them short.\n\nGiven the club have Champions League aspirations, they cannot afford to leave themselves light for the second half of the campaign.\n\nAs things stand, former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and former coach Michael Carrick are favourites to take charge, but whether they do so as a partnership like before remains to be seen.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "The last play between Ole Miss and Miami saw plenty of contact. And no flag.",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff semifinal between Ole Miss and Miami came down to one final Hail Mary. When the dust cleared, a few people seemed to think the officials had missed a key penalty.\n\nWith six seconds remaining and down 31-27, Ole Miss found itself at Miami's 35-yard line and had a chance for one last punch in what was already a wild ending. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss got the ball to the end zone, but wide receiver De'Zhaun Stribling could only get a single, flailing hand on it as it landed.\n\nThe incomplete pass sealed a win for Miami, which will play Indiana or Oregon in the national championship game on Jan. 19.\n\nTHE LAST PLAY THAT SENT MIAMI TO THE CFP NATTY 🏆 pic.twitter.com/xHXFD1iR2B\n\nHowever, quite a few fans noticed some hard contact in the scramble for the ball. Stribling definitely noticed it, as he held up his hands after the play, wondering why a flag wasn't coming.\n\nFurther replay showed Miami defensive back Ethan O'Connor had his hand in Stribling's collar as the ball arrived, and that Stribling was doing something similar to O'Connor.\n\nThis time, no DPI on Miami to close the Fiesta Bowl. pic.twitter.com/byZL6A9OfK\n\n— Connor O'Gara (@cjogara) January 9, 2026\n\nLast play of the #FiestaBowl pic.twitter.com/gRcpmVI2Ih\n\n— 🜲 🜲 🜲 (@fsh733) January 9, 2026\n\nPenalties are rarely called on Hail Marys, as both receivers and defenders are often doing whatever they can to be at the top of the heap when the ball reaches the end zone. ESPN rules expert Bill LeMonnier believed the officials made the right decision with a no-call:\n\n“We have what we call mutual combat. Both players are getting their hands on each other. We’re going to leave that alone 99% of the time. I want to see one of them get a true, true advantage.”\n\nHad defensive pass interference been called, it would have been another, untimed play for Ole Miss at Miami's 20-yard line. That would have still been a tough get, but it was better than what reality offered.\n\nThe play ends a chaotic but ultimately successful season for the Rebels, who went 11-1 in the regular season, beat Tulane and Georgia in the first two rounds of the College Football Playoffs and lost head coach Lane Kiffin to LSU in the process. That standoff over Kiffin's exit threatened to overshadow the postseason for the program, but the players and new head coach Pete Golding still managed to play at a high level.\n\nThe loss is also a tough break for Kiffin. Had his old program won, it would have been another $250,000 for him in LSU's incredible bonus-matching agreement.",

    "description": "Vijay Singh's whopping career earnings come with a fun and, until this week, little-talked-about perk: a golden ticket back to the Tour.",
    "fullText": "Vijay Singh has made 648 career PGA Tour starts. That doesn't sniff the haul of Mark Brooks, who made a record 803 Tour appearances, but it's still a ton of golf.\n\nSingh's first Tour start came when Bush 41 was still in office, at the 1992 Memorial, where the then relative unknown 29-year-old Fijian played on a sponsor's exemption and tied for 7th. Over the next three-plus decades, Singh compiled a resume that elevated him to a place among the all-time greats: 34 wins, 28 runners-up, a staggering made-cut percentage of nearly 80% and - generational wealth alert! - more than $71 million in on-course earnings, which ranks 6th on the career winnings list behind only Tiger, Rory, Scottie and two gilded J's (Justin Rose and Jim Furyk).\n\nThat last accolade comes with a fun and, until this week, little-talked-about perk: a golden ticket back to the Tour. As decreed in the Tour's eligibility rules, players who have lost Tour status but are among the top 50 all-time earners may regain full membership for a season of their choice. The ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nThis year, Singh, who is 62, is cashing in.\n\nA soon-to-be 63-year-old golfer rejoining the world's most competitive tour is not as wild as, say, the hypothetical of Michael Jordan (who is 62) resigning with the Bulls or Roger Clemens (who is 63) returning to an MLB mound, but it's still a comeback at which to marvel, especially in an era in which the Tour has been getting leaner.\n\nBut the rules are the rules and beginning with the Sony Open in Honolulu next week, Singh will be back pacing Tour fairways for the first time (non-Masters division) since the 2021 Honda Classic, where he shot 74-73 and missed the cut. Singh's last made-cut on Tour came at the 2020 Memorial, where he tied for 62nd. The last time he played 10 or more events in a season was in 2017-18.\n\nSingh won't have carte blanche playing privileges; the designated events will, of course, be off limits. But a Tour spokesperson said that Singh \"will likely be eligible for the vast majority of full-field events\" in 2026. The spokesperson did not know how many of those tournaments Singh intends to enter.\n\nSingh has battled injuries in recent years, notably a balky back. In April, he withdrew from the Masters, citing an undisclosed injury, which snapped his run of 31 consecutive Masters starts. In 20 appearances on the PGA Tour Champions last year, he had 6 top 10s and finished 23rd on the money list.\n\nSingh is known for his tireless work ethic and marathon range sessions, and he still has pop; his 292.4-yard average driving distance in 2025 ranked 16th on the Champions circuit. But there's long and then there's PGA Tour long. That driving average would have ranked 164th on the PGA Tour in 2025, a couple of ticks above the likes of Lucas Glover and Russell Henley.\n\nSingh knows what he's up against. He said as much when he played in the 2019 Players Championship as a 57-year-old. \"Playing the regular Tour is a lot more pressure, I think, to play well,\" he said. \"There’s a lot more work required to go out there and be ready to play. I practice more when I play the regular Tour. The preparation is a little bit different.\n\n\"Playing the Champions tour, it’s a lot more relaxing for me. When I started playing there, I don’t want to come back here, like it’s so easy to play there, you get practice rounds in the cart and pro-am in the cart. Over here, it’s a full four days, plus two extra days of playing and walking.\"\n\nNews of Singh's return to the young-guys tour, where he'll be playing against opponents four decades his junior, has drawn the ire of at least some members of the golf Twitter peanut gallery, who have alleged that Singh, essentially on a lark, will be taking away precious playing spots from more deserving or needy players. Singh weathered similar criticism when he entered a Korn Ferry Tour event in 2020; so intense was the blowback that he withdrew.\n\nIn response to Singh's 2026 return, Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee said his beef is not so much with Singh as it with the exemption itself. \"This is what happens when you give into or give too much power to players,\" Chamblee wrote on X. \"If the PGA Tour is going to claim to be a sport based upon meritocracy, you can't allow players to monetize their performances of a decade or decades ago, through current exemptions. Sport must always answer the question: why are you here rather than someone else? And the answer can never be because I was great ten or twenty years ago.\"\n\nCould Singh still be great? Highly unlikely. Could he still make cuts? Certainly. He did so at the 2024 Masters, where he opened 75-73 before a third-round 82 derailed him. The oldest player to make a PGA Tour cut in an individual stroke-play event is Sam Snead, who, at 67, played the weekend at the 1979 Westchester Classic. Jack Nicklaus and Fred Funk both made PGA Tour cuts at 64, and Tom Watson did so at 65. On the right course, on the right week, it's not unthinkable that Singh could find himself within shouting distance of the lead.\n\nIf he's not, you'll probably find him on the range.\n\nThe post This 62-year-old is rejoining PGA Tour. Here's the rule that enabled it appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Miami is playing for its first national title in over two decades after taking down Ole Miss 31-27 in the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday night. Here are the five plays that stood out in the No. 10 Hurricanes' College Football Playoff semifinal win over the No. 6 Rebels.\n\nThe star Ole Miss running back put the Rebels up 7-3 on the first play of the second quarter with his long TD run.\n\nKEWAN LACY 73 YARDS TO THE 🏠 pic.twitter.com/h7jsXm77V9\n\nBut that TD came at a cost to Ole Miss. Lacy appeared to suffer a right hamstring injury as he approached the end zone. Replays showed that he appeared to be laboring as he slowed toward the goal line.\n\nLacy didn’t play another snap the rest of the quarter and Ole Miss coach Pete Golding said he’d be evaluated at halftime. Lacy returned to the game in the third quarter with a compression sleeve on his right leg. And he served as a decoy for much of the second half.\n\nOle Miss threw the ball 19 straight times before Lacy got his first carry of the second half. He finished with 11 carries for 103 yards and a TD.\n\nToney gave Miami a 24-19 lead with 5:04 to go when he caught a tunnel screen and raced 36 yards for a touchdown.\n\nTHE FRESHMAN 🔥\n\nMalachi Toney turned on the jets! pic.twitter.com/pCvyMAOknz\n\nThe freshman wide receiver was targeted 10 times and had five catches for 81 yards. Hardly any of those catches were downfield, either. Tony ended the game with 77 yards after the catch; no other Miami player had more than 30.\n\nToney emerged as one of the most dynamic playmakers in college football as a freshman in 2025 and has more than 1,000 receiving yards. He also made an incredible catch that didn’t count later in the game. Had Toney gotten his entire foot down in bounds on this grab, we’d run out of words trying to describe how good it was.\n\nIt took Ole Miss less than two minutes to respond to Toney’s TD. Wright scored on the sixth play of a 75-yard drive to give Ole Miss a one-point lead before Trinidad Chambliss’ two-point pass to Caleb Odom put Ole Miss up 27-24.\n\nChambliss in the clutch 😤 \n\nThe Rebels regain the lead 👀 \n\nWatch NOW on ESPN and the ESPN App pic.twitter.com/3WnYMhbCyg\n\nWright found himself wide open on a corner route after the safety was late to follow him to the pylon. It was the third catch of the game for Wright as he finished with 64 yards receiving.\n\nAfter Toney’s touchdown came on Miami’s fourth play of a 75-yard drive, the Hurricanes needed a lot more plays to regain the lead. Carson Beck’s 3-yard TD with 18 seconds to go gave Miami a 31-27 lead.\n\nMIAMI WITH A SPOT IN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP ON THE LINE! 🔥 \n\nCanes takes the lead with 18 seconds left 😳 pic.twitter.com/PI9RRBqGau\n\nBeck’s run was the 15th play of a drive that took nearly three minutes for the Hurricanes.\n\nBeck attempted 12 passes on that drive as the Hurricanes also benefitted from a facemask penalty on Ole Mis defensive back Jaylon Braxton. He was called for a facemask as Beck threw toward Keelan Marion on the sideline with just under two minutes to go.\n\nThe TD was Beck’s first rushing TD since he scored in a Week 3 win over USF. The Georgia transfer finished the game 23-of-37 passing for 268 yards and two touchdowns and an interception while he rushed for minus-6 yards when sacks were taken into account.\n\nOle Miss’ chances of a comeback were farfetched after Beck’s score. The Rebels had just one timeout remaining but were at midfield with 13 seconds to go.\n\nThe Rebels then got to the Miami 35-yard line with six seconds to go before Chambliss heaved a Hail Mary toward the end zone as time expired.\n\nLast play of the #FiestaBowl pic.twitter.com/gRcpmVI2Ih\n\n— 🜲 🜲 🜲 (@fsh733) January 9, 2026\n\nOle Miss fans understandably wanted pass interference on the Hail Mary. But it’s important to note that pass interference is hardly called on those attempts. And a penalty would not have guaranteed Ole Miss a legit chance at the win.\n\nIf officials threw a flag on the play, the Rebels would simply have had an untimed down from the 20-yard line. Sure, it’s easier to score from the 20 than it is the 35-yard line, but it’s still a low-percentage play. Miami would have likely won the game even with a penalty. But did the penalty prevent De’Zhaun Stribling from catching the pass? He was able to tip the ball as it fell incomplete.",

    "description": "Miami won the Fiesta Bowl over Ole Miss after the Rebels' pass to the end zone fell incomplete. But did the Hurricanes commit pass interference?",
    "fullText": "The Fiesta Bowl matchup between No. 6 Mississippi and No. 10 Miami turned into an instant classic, with the Hurricanes coming from behind to win 31-27 and advance to the College Football Playoff championship game.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be a true CFP game without at least a little controversy — and the Hurricanes and Rebels delivered on the game's final play.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Miami beats Ole Miss with last-minute TD in Fiesta Bowl, will play for national title\n\nAfter giving up a 3-yard go-ahead touchdown to Carson Beck with 18 seconds left, Ole Miss advanced to the Miami 35-yard line as Trinidad Chambliss completed passes of 23 and 17 yards, respectively, to set up one final shot at the end zone. Ultimately, his pass to De'Zhaun Stribling fell incomplete, with Miami defensive back Ethan O'Connor in defense.\n\nHowever, Chambliss and the Ole Miss sideline were quick to call for a flag in the immediate aftermath of the incompletion, believing O'Connor had committed pass interference, which — had officials thrown a flag — would have set up another shot at the end zone, this time from the 20-yard line. Officials swallowed their whistles, ending the game.\n\nTHE MIAMI HURRICANES ARE HEADED TO THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP #PMSCFP pic.twitter.com/Id1MW1qfyU\n\n— Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) January 9, 2026\n\nHere's another vantage of the play, which shows O'Connor grabbing onto Stribling's jersey as they both ran to the back of the end zone. O'Connor also appears to impede Stribling's chances at making a play on the ball.\n\nThis time, no DPI on Miami to close the Fiesta Bowl. pic.twitter.com/byZL6A9OfK\n\n— Connor O'Gara (@cjogara) January 9, 2026\n\nUltimately, officials elected not to call pass interference, and Ole Miss fans and neutral observers alike weren't happy officials did not call what they believed to be a game-changing penalty:\n\nShould have been pass interference on Miami wow pic.twitter.com/BFKHyW5YVf\n\n— Tedd Buddwell 🏀🏈 (@TedBuddy8) January 9, 2026\n\nObvious pass interference in the end zone.

    "fullText": "Betting on himself pays off in a heartbeat. And Carson Beck’s decision to stay in college football for one more season turns golden as Miami heads to the CFP finals with a 31–27 win over Ole Miss. This is their first championship berth since 2001, and all thanks to Beck’s last-minute game-changing TDs that turned things around. Now, Beck sums up the moment like a hero.\n\n“We never flinched,” Miami quarterback Carson Beck said after the game. “We, I mean, in the face of adversity, when we had to respond, we responded. You could just see it in their eye. You could see it in their eye. We all had a good feeling that what just happened was about to happen.\n\n“I actually went in drive, and you were trying to loosen them up by some right before you drove it down for the win. I told them, we got three minutes for the rest of our lives, bro. No shit else matters, alright? I don’t mean to cuss. Emotions are rolling, but nothing else matters. We got three minutes to go do this, man.”\n\nCarson Beck scrambled for a three-yard rushing touchdown with 18 seconds left, sending Miami past Ole Miss. Something that he later calls “the best feeling I ever had in my life.” The game swung wildly in the fourth quarter as Ole Miss brightly took control of the game.\n\nQuarterback Trinidad Chambliss connected with Wright on a 24-yard touchdown pass to put the Rebels ahead 27-24 with 3:13 minutes remaining. Despite that, Beck steadies the Hurricanes, calmly leading the game-changing drive.\n\nThe post Carson Beck Reveals Last 3 Minute Moment Before Historic Miami Touchdown appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "After a slow first period, the Carolina Hurricanes sharpened up their game and went on the defeat the Anaheim Ducks, 5-2 on Thursday night at the Lenovo Center.\n\nIt was the third straight win for Carolina while the Ducks have now lost eight in a row.\n\nThe home team got off to a bit of a slow start and fell behind 1-0 in the first but they turned things around in the second.\n\nThey outshot the Ducks 19-3 in that period and put three goals up on the board.\n\nFirst, Mark Jankowski got things started when he took the puck to the net.\n\nShortly after, Granlund scored from in close but that would be it for Anaheim.\n\nTwo minutes after that score, Taylor Hall made a perfect feed to an open Logan Stankoven to tie things up again. That made three goals in the last three games for Stankoven.\n\nJalen Chatfield blasted in a shot to give the Canes a 3-2 lead going into the second intermission. It was Chatfield’s 300th NHL game.\n\nThe Canes continued to shut down the opposition in the third as the Ducks could only manage another four shots in that period.\n\nCarolina goaltender, Fred Andersen did what he needed to do and stopped the shots he saw to earn his first win since early November. The win put an end to a nine game losing streak for Andersen.\n\nMidway through the third, Jackson Blake made a pretty backhander off an Alexander Nikishin shot to put the home team up by two.\n\nTaylor Hall notched an empty-netter to close out the scoring.\n\nIn all, the Canes outshot the Ducks, 35-13.\n\nCarolina dominated the faceoff circle winning 64%.\n\nThe Hurricanes will take Friday off and will prepare to take on the Seattle Kraken on Saturday night.\n\nGame Summary – https://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20252026/GS020688.HTM\n\nEvent Summary – https://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20252026/ES020688.HTM\n\nInterviews – https://canespr.com/2026/01/06/january-6-postgame-notes-stats-video-audio/",

And despite Kiffin no longer coaching the Rebels, he is able to continue financially benefiting from his old team's playoff victories.\n\nLanguage in Kiffin's LSU contract allows him to still receive the bonuses for playoff success he would have received from Ole Miss had he stayed at the school.\n\nHere's what to know about how much Lane Kiffin makes from Ole Miss' CFP wins.\n\nMORE: Which Ole Miss assistants followed Lane Kiffin to LSU?\n\nThe Advocate reported that Kiffin agreed to a seven-year deal, $91 million deal in Baton Rouge, which also has opportunities to earn more via incentives. Additionally, language in Kiffin's contract reportedly requires a raise from LSU to make him the highest-paid coach in the country if he wins a national championship.\n\nIn the deal, LSU committed to paying any bonuses Kiffin would have received during Ole Miss' playoff run, per ESPN.\n\nKiffin is reportedly set to make $13 million annually, making him one of the highest-paid coaches in college football. Georgia's Kirby Smart is the only coach who makes more annually, based on reported figures.\n\nKiffin's Ole Miss salary in 2025 was exactly $9 million, per USA Today, which made him the 11th highest-paid head coach in college football. Kiffin signed a six-year extension worth $54 million in 2023 with Ole Miss.\n\nMORE: The highest paid coaches in college football\n\nLSU included language in Kiffin's new contract that allows him to financially benefit from when his former team, Ole Miss, wins playoff games. When Ole Miss beat Tulane in the first round of the CFP, Kiffin received $250,000, per Front Office Sports. And he received $500,000 after Ole Miss upset Georgia to reach the semifinals.\n\nDepending on how far Ole Miss advances, Kiffin could receive plenty more from the Tigers.\n\nHere is the structure of how much Kiffin receives for Ole Miss CFP wins, per Front Office Sports:\n\n$150,000 for advancing to the first round of the CFP\n\n$250,000 for appearing in the quarterfinals\n\n$500,000 if Ole Miss advances to the semifinals\n\n$750,000 if Ole Miss advances to the national championship\n\n$1 million if Ole Miss wins the title\n\nMORE: When does LSU play Ole Miss in 2026?",

    "description": "Opponent insight on Philadelphia’s upcoming playoff matchup.",
    "fullText": "Have you heard? The Philadelphia Eagles are hosting the San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday.\n\nIn order to preview this Wild Card matchup, I reached out to our enemies over at Niners Nation. The nice Nicholas McGee kindly took the time took the time to answer my questions about this upcoming playoff battle. Let’s take a look at the answers.\n\nI think most 49ers fans would probably accept that this is likely going to be a step too far. The team will undoubtedly fight, and they deserve immense credit for what they’ve achieved this season with the injury adversity they’ve faced. However, with the injuries they have on defense — particularly at linebacker — and the doubt surrounding Trent Williams and Ricky Pearsall, it’s difficult to see the 49ers having enough in the tank to pull off the upset. A wild card defeat would be disappointing but, given all that’s transpired in a year of transition, the season as a whole should be seen as a step forward by a young roster.\n\nWe have to be honest, there isn’t much in the 49ers’ favor in this game. If Williams is healthy, then it can be argued that the 49ers have an edge with their tackles going against the Eagles’ defensive front in the run game. Williams and Colton McKivitz were two of the best run-blocking tackles in football in the regular season, and the Eagles have shown some vulnerability to the rush, ranking 17th in run stop win rate and 19th in success rate allowed against the run. Despite the strong play of Williams and McKivitz, the 49er run game hasn’t fired on all cylinders this season. Yet if they can win the battle on the line of scrimmage and open holes for Christian McCaffrey, then San Francisco’s slim chances of upsetting the odds will improve.\n\nThere’s a lot to choose from, but I think I’d probably settle on the Eagles’ pass-catchers against the 49ers’ back seven. That’s not an answer tied to the cornerback play, but rather the injuries at linebacker and the struggles at safety, a position where the Niners have continued to get extremely volatile play despite investing pretty heavily in that spot in the draft in recent years. If Dallas Goedert is healthy and the 49ers aren’t able to get pressure, then it could be a really productive day for Jalen Hurts attacking the flimsy spine of the 49er defense.\n\nI think they would do it again, considering the relatively small opportunity cost. He was impressive as a rotational pass rusher, which was the role the 49ers envisioned for him, when Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams were healthy. As the injuries have piled up on the defensive line, he’s had to take on more of a burden in playing increased snaps and the impact of his rushes has waned. Still, when the 49ers have successfully disrupted the quarterback, it has typically been Huff doing the damage. Even in an awful season for the 49er pass rush, Huff has consistently created pressure. Whether he makes any tangible impact on this game will likely depend on whether his running mates up front can do the same and give the 49ers an at least mildly effective team rush.\n\nI think the 49ers can do enough to keep this game relatively close, but with their susceptibility to both the run and the pass, I expect the defense to ultimately prove their undoing. The 49ers ideally want to turn this game into a shootout but, potentially going against a Vic Fangio defense without Williams and Pearsall, they don’t really have the offensive resources to do that. I expect an admirable effort on the road, but a one-score defeat feels about right.\n\nPrediction: Eagles 28, 49ers 20.",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans added another name to the list of head coaching candidates, requesting an interview with former Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury.",
    "fullText": "Earlier in the week, the Washington Commanders and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury agreed to mutually part ways, and it did not take long for him to end up in the head coaching cycle. On Thursday, Kingsbury became the 13th potential candidate linked to the Tennessee Titans' coaching search, with Tennessee joining the Baltimore Ravens in requesting an interview.\n\nKingsbury is an intriguing, offensive-minded candidate who would bring a system that fits with Cam Ward’s skill set. Known for his work with Patrick Mahomes in college, he took over the Arizona Cardinals in 2019 and led them to a 28-37-1 record before being fired at the conclusion of the 2022 season.\n\nWhile in Arizona, his team improved over the first three seasons at the helm, eventually making the playoffs in 2021. However, injuries derailed the team in 2022, and the team regressed, leading to his firing at the end of the season.\n\nThat was fast: Sources say former #Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury will interview for the #Ravens and #Titans open HC positions. pic.twitter.com/75d7cZhwXq\n\n— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) January 8, 2026\n\nAfter one season as an offensive analyst at USC, he returned to the NFL in 2024 with the Commanders as offensive coordinator, helping propel rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels to a record-setting season. However, he was unable to replicate those results in 2025, mostly due to injuries.\n\nWith a lack of established offensive-minded candidates, it is likely that Kingsbury’s stock will continue to rise during this cycle, especially with teams that feature athletic quarterbacks after his early success with Kyler Murray and Daniels.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Tennessee Titans: Kliff Kingsbury to interview for head coach",

    "fullText": "Miami Madness: How Hurricanes won CFP semifinal thriller against Ole Miss originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIs the College Football Playoff now the College Football Tournament?\n\nThat's how this feels now. The CFP is the CFT – and that is how the ACC is back in the championship game. \"January Madness\" doesn't have the same ring to it.\n\nWhat about \"Miami Madness\"? It's here.\n\nHow else can you explain how the Hurricanes will play for the College Football Playoff championship on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.? No. 10 Miami created that with a thrilling 31-27 victory against No. 6 Ole Miss in the College Football Playoff semifinal at Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Thursday.\n\nQuarterback Carson Beck – a sixth-year senior transfer from Georgia – high-stepped into the end zone with a 3-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds remaining. That was the score in a back-and-forth with Ole Miss star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss in a 25-point fourth quarter that resembled the final minutes of a March Madness thriller.\n\nIt wasn't over until Chambliss' desperation pass into the end zone between Ethan O'Connor and Zechariah Poyser fell incomplete. There was no late flag this time.\n\nMiami (13-2) beat Ole Miss (13-2), and now faces the winner of the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl between No. 1 Indiana (14-0) and No. 5 Oregon (13-1).\n\nIs this how the 12-team College Football Playoff is going to work? Do you love it?\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nOle Miss kicker Lucas Carneiro took center stage in CFP\n\nWhat is next for Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss?\n\nThe Hurricanes had +2700 odds to win the national championship coming into the CFP as the “bubble team.” Miami was on the outside looking in through most of November, but they leap-frogged No. 11 Notre Dame in the final set of rankings as the last at-large team in the field.\n\nThe Hurricanes watched five-loss Duke win the ACC championship game against Virginia, but the Hurricanes were the team the conference campaigned for to get into the field. By no coincidence, ACC commissioner Jim Phillips could be seen on the sideline Thursday wearing an orange-and-white tie. This is a huge win for the conference made better by knocking the SEC out of the field.\n\nMORE: SEC lags behind in bowl standings\n\nThe Hurricanes have pulled off upsets against Texas A&M and Ohio State, then won the thriller against Ole Miss to keep the momentum going. They will be underdogs again against the Hoosiers or Ducks. So it could be argued that Miami – the program with five national championships – is your realistic College Football Playoff version of a Cinderella.\n\nMiami led 17-13 at halftime – but it felt like the Hurricanes should have led by more. The Hurricanes out-gained the Rebels 228-145, ran 19 more offensive plays and controlled time of possession at 22 minutes and 14 seconds compared to Ole Miss at seven minutes and 16 seconds.\n\nThe Hurricanes made those little plays that made a difference. Miami faced a third-and-8 in the second quarter. Beck fired a short pass to receiver Malachi Toney, who stepped out of the tackle by Suntarine Perkins and picked up the first down.\n\nThe Hurricanes turned that into a 4-yard TD run by CharMar Brown with 7:23 left in the half. Beck hit a wide-open Keelan Marion for a 52-yard TD on the next drive. Ole Miss countered that with a pair of field goals from Lucas Carneiro from 42 and 58 yards, respectively, for the 17-13 halftime score.\n\nThe Hurricanes tried to give it back in the second half. Miami defensive players dropped four interceptions in the game and had a series of head-scratching penalties. Ole Miss had a 24-19 lead before Toney took a screen pass from Beck for a 36-yard TD with 5:04 remaining for a  24-19 lead.\n\nOle Miss got the ball back with 5:04 remaining, and Chambliss continued his heater that led the Rebels to a 39-34 victory in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. Chambliss threw a 24-yard TD pass to Dae'Quan Wright with 3:13 remaining for a 27-24 lead. Miami answered with a 15-play, 75-yard drive led by Beck, who finished 23 of 37 for 268 yards, two TDs and one interception.\n\nChambliss – who finished 23 of 37 for 277 yards and a TD – nearly led the Rebels to the CFP championship game. This was the team whose coach Lane Kiffin took the LSU job at the end of the regular season. Yet an instant classic that had four lead changes ended with Miami going home for the national championship.\n\nThis would only add to the \"Madness.\" Consider that since 2014, only one men's basketball team that held the No. 1 overall seed going into the NCAA Tournament has won the national championship. That was No. 1 UConn, which won back-to-back national titles. The previous season, the Huskies beat No. 5 Miami in the Final Four.\n\nWere those Hurricanes under Jim Larranaga any more of a long-shot than the ones on the football field that have burned through No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 2 Ohio State – the defending national champion – before beating the Rebels on Thursday?\n\nMiami's defense has injuries. A defense that had 12 sacks in the first two rounds with Rueben Bain Jr. had just one sack against the Rebels. Yet Miami coach Mario Cristobal has found a way to push this team into the championship game with a patient running game – Miami had 51 rushing attempts while Ole Miss had 21 with Mark Fletcher Jr. totaling 22 carries for 133 yards – and Beck is now 37-5 as a starter.\n\nThey'll be in their backyard too, the unintended home-field advantage that will come with a list of Miami icons watching from the sidelines. Did anybody think this was possible when the Hurricanes played their final home game in the regular season against NC State on Nov. 15 before five straight wins away from home?\n\nThere is only one word for that.",

    "description": "Miami is flying home on Friday from the Fiesta Bowl.  It'll be the last flight for the Hurricanes this season.  For the fifth time, Miami will be playing for a national championship on its home field.",
    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Miami is flying home on Friday from the Fiesta Bowl. It'll be the last flight for the Hurricanes this season.\n\nThey'll get to the next game — the last game — by bus.\n\nFor the fifth time, Miami will be playing for a national championship on its home field. The first four of those games were at the now-demolished Orange Bowl; this one against either Oregon or Indiana in the College Football Playoff title game on Jan. 19 will be at Hard Rock Stadium, the Miami Dolphins' home field, where the Hurricanes have played their home games since 2008.\n\n“We’re back in Hard Rock,” quarterback Carson Beck said after he produced the go-ahead touchdown — with his legs, not his arm — in Miami's 31-27 win over Mississippi in the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday night. “So, I think that’s all that needs to be said.”\n\nMiami is 3-1 in its other national-title-game appearances at home — though it should be noted that in the Bowl Championship Series and now CFP era when there has been a designated “national championship game,” the Hurricanes have not gotten this far.\n\n“This team knows they are the team and the time is now,” coach Mario Cristobal said during the on-field celebration Thursday night.\n\nOther teams have won national championships close to home over the years. For example, Southern California claims national titles in the 1931 and 1932 seasons after winning Rose Bowls (it wasn't USC's home field, but not exactly a long road trip for the Trojans, either). Those came before The Associated Press began awarding a national championship trophy with the 1936 season.\n\nIn recent years, LSU won a BCS title (but not the AP title) for the 2003 season by winning the Sugar Bowl in nearby New Orleans — about 80 miles from Baton Rouge. LSU secured national championships for the 2007 and 2019 seasons by winning in New Orleans as well.\n\nBeing at home — or near home — hasn't guaranteed titles, though. Texas beat USC in the Rose Bowl to win the 2005 season's national championship. Alabama faced what might have been considered road games in the 2011 and 2017 seasons and won both, topping LSU in New Orleans and Georgia in Atlanta for national crowns.\n\nAnd Miami's most recent home title game was a loss as well, when the Hurricanes fell to Oklahoma 24-17 to end the 1994 season.\n\nHere's look at Miami's previous home title-game appearances.\n\n1983 season: Miami 31, Nebraska 30\n\nThe Hurricanes ran out to a 17-0 lead over the top-ranked, unbeaten and heavily favored Cornhuskers, who clawed within 31-30 with 48 seconds left. Nebraska coach Tom Osborne decided to try a 2-point conversion instead of playing for the tie; the pass fell incomplete and Miami finished atop the AP poll. “We're No. 1,” Hurricanes coach Howard Schnellenberger said. “No doubt about it.” He was right, and Miami had its first national title.\n\n1987 season: Miami 20, Oklahoma 14\n\nOklahoma came in undefeated and ranked No. 1, Miami came in undefeated and ranked No. 2. The teams were tied 7-7 at halftime, but the Hurricanes scored 10 points in the fourth quarter and held on to win their second national championship.\n\n1991 season: Miami 22, Nebraska 0\n\nMiami's fourth national title, and third won at the Orange Bowl, was no contest. The Hurricanes led 13-0 after just 11 minutes of play and the defense never let Nebraska — a double-digit underdog — get on track.\n\n1994 season: Nebraska 24, Miami 17\n\nIn the final year of the short-lived Bowl Coalition era, the Hurricanes ran out to a 10-0 lead after the first quarter. But the Cornhuskers wouldn't go away, and Cory Schlesinger ran for two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to cap the comeback and lead Nebraska to the win.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "'Mutual combat' on final play of Miami vs. Ole Miss: Explaining pass interference no-call at end of CFP semifinal originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a back-and-forth fourth quarter in Thursday’s Fiesta Bowl, it was only fitting that it came down to one final play between Miami and Ole Miss.\n\nThe two teams exchanged leads throughout the final frame, but Carson Beck’s rushing touchdown with 18 seconds remaining proved to be the difference in the Hurricanes’ 31-27 win, sending them to the College Football Playoff championship game. Still, there was some controversy at the end.\n\nOn Trinidad Chambliss’ final Hail Mary attempt, which fell incomplete, officials ruled there was no pass interference by a Miami defender after he appeared to grab Rebels wide receiver De’Zhaun Stribling’s jersey.\n\nHere’s how officials ruled the play “mutual combat” between the defensive back and receiver, officially deciding the Fiesta Bowl and sending Miami to the national championship.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Carson Beck's game-winning drive vs. Ole Miss\n\nTrailing by four with just seconds remaining, Ole Miss had no other option than a Hail Mary attempt to close out the CFP semifinals. Chambliss fired a deep pass into the left corner of the end zone, almost right on target for his receiver, but it was broken up and fell incomplete.\n\nIn real time, it appeared there wasn't any case for pass interference. A few Miami defenders were in the area, and the ball wound up being just out of the reach of Stribling's arms.\n\nTHE LAST PLAY THAT SENT MIAMI TO THE CFP NATTY 🏆 pic.twitter.com/xHXFD1iR2B\n\nLooking at further angles revealed at least a case for defensive pass interference, however. Defensive back Ethan O'Connor was visibly tugging on Stribling's jersey prior the ball arriving, then when Stribling went to make a dive toward the ball, he was smothered by Hurricanes defenders as the ball fell incomplete.\n\nJust the defender doing his job.... No flag on the final play of the game pic.twitter.com/0SfjgZSNR9\n\n— Rate the Refs (@Rate_the_Refs) January 9, 2026\n\nESPN's rules expert referred to the play as \"mutual combat,\" with both players, O'Connor and Stribling, playing a role in the physicality.\n\nPlenty of fans online, however, saw the play as O'Connor interfering for a few yards before the players entangled closer to the ball\n\nWait… did Miami get away with blatant pass interference?\n\nOle Miss robbed?pic.twitter.com/h5aZSqMzvC\n\n— Ratioed Sports (@RatioedSports) January 9, 2026\n\nEven former Rebels coach Lane Kiffin chimed in, calling it pass interference.\n\nPass interference 💯!!! https://t.co/99jrGosJ5w\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) January 9, 2026\n\nAfter the game, Ole Miss head coach Pete Golding was asked about the potential pass interference.\n\n\"Those situations are tough to call. Yeah, there was contact. It happens a lot,\" Golding said, per The Rebel Walk. \"That's not why we lost the game. I think it shows you the resilience of this team.\"\n\nMORE: What's next for Trinidad Chambliss after loss to Miami?\n\n\"Mutual combat\" in football is typically a term used to describe a receiver and defensive back being \"mutually\" as physical with one another on a play, meaning no penalty would be called despite that physicality.\n\nWith the receiver and defensive back competing for the ball, officials sometimes leave potential pass interference as a no-call because of how entangled both players are in the interaction. If one player is blatantly interfering, that changes things, but \"mutual combat\" is more about reciprocal hand-fighting reflected on both players.\n\nMORE: What's next for Trinidad Chambliss after Ole Miss' season ending?\n\nIn college football, defensive pass interference is flagged when a defensive player significantly prevents an eligible receiver's chance to catch a pass beyond the neutral zone. It typically is called for contact like grabbing, pushing or tripping the receiver before the ball arrives.\n\nPass interference only applies to forward passes that travel beyond the neutral zone in college football.\n\nMORE:Breaking down Trinidad Chambliss' NFL Draft projection\n\nThursday's pass interference debate was a bit reminiscent of another Fiesta Bowl. In 2003, with Miami taking on Ohio State in the BCS national championship, Terry Porter threw one of the most controversial flags ever, just when the Hurricanes had appeared to take a 24-17 win in overtime and win the national title.\n\nPorter called pass interference on Miami's Glenn Sharp, and because of it, Ohio State stayed alive in the game and received a first down. The Buckeyes then proceeded to tie the game, then win it in a second overtime.\n\nPart of the controversy was how long it took Porter to throw the flag, as a few seconds had passed after the play and Miami appearing to win. The Hurricanes had begun celebrating by the time the flag came out.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s academy talents were ignored and criticised by Ruben Amorim, often unjustly.\n\nThe former head coach criticised Chido Obi, Harry Amass, and Toby Collyer, while refusing to hand Kobbie Mainoo a start in the Premier League despite the obvious midfield deficiencies.\n\nPlenty of Carrington’s finest have been waiting in the wings to make their first team debut, and only towards the end of Amorim’s regime did Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey come on for their debuts.\n\nThere are quite a few others, like Sekou Kone, who were close to a breakthrough last season, but the Portuguese tactician did not trust him enough in the end.\n\nHe impressed on the post-season tour of Asia, and was part of the pre-season squad but did not make it off the bench.\n\nThat clearly showed chances would be limited and there were talks of a loan move in the summer but it did not materialise. A horror injury further restricted his minutes for the U21s.\n\nAnd now, the Malian, who is fully fit, has been linked with a temporary switch to INEOS-owned club FC Lausanne Sport in the winter window.\n\nAs revealed by Blick, the 19-year-old is already training with the Swiss side, and is also expected to play in one of their friendlies against either Xamax or Nyon.\n\nThe Swiss Super League side already have Enzo Kana-Biyik on loan from the Red Devils, and a final decision on whether Sekou Kone will join them is expected before the window closes.\n\nManager Peter Zeidler revealed, “Yes, he’s (Sekou Kone) been with us for a few days, we know he’s a good player and we’ve been watching him closely. He’ll play with us on Thursday against Xamax or Nyon.\n\nOn whether it is a trial, the German replied, “I don’t really like that term; it doesn’t reflect reality.\n\n“He’s with us, we can observe him closely, and we’ll make a decision, just like we did last summer with Enzo Kana-Biyik, a very good young player who improved a lot in just a few months with us despite his early-season injury, and who also belongs to Manchester United.\n\n“We saw his quality, particularly with his assist against Fiorentina. We have good experience with Enzo, so why not with Sekou Koné? But to say today whether he’ll come, I don’t know. It depends on several factors; we’ll decide between January 15th and February 15th, as with all players.”\n\nIt will be interesting to see if INEOS actually loan him out, especially if the new caretaker boss decided to rely on youth once he comes in.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "On This Day (9 Jan 1993): Winger Nets First Sunderland Goal – Two Years After Signing!",
    "description": "We take a look back at Brian Mooney’s Sunderland career – including his best game for the club, 33 years to the day.",
    "fullText": "Brian Mooney arrived at Roker Park in February 1991, billed as the attacker who could spark Sunderland’s attack and help the club stave off the potential threat of relegation. The 25-year-old right winger had come through the ranks at Liverpool earning rave reviews at youth team level and playing for the first team in a league cup tie at Fulham for Liverpool, however breaking into what was possibly the best club side in the world in at the time would have been a challenge for anyone.\n\nKeen for first-team football, Mooney had a loan spell at Wrexham before joining Preston North End. He excelled at Deepdale, making a name for himself as one of the most exciting players outside of the top flight. Ron Atkinson had taken him to Sheffield Wednesday on a three-month loan with the intention of signing him, but injuries curtailed his time at Hillsborough. After Mooney had returned to Preston and proved his fitness, Denis Smith pounced, hoping the Irish winger – who’d been called up to the national squad prior to Italia 90 – would be the key to unlocking First Division defences.\n\nSmith had tried to sign Mooney three years earlier after a couple of impressive performances against Sunderland, but had been put off by the £750,000 fee that had been quoted by Preston’s then manager, John McGrath. A more palatable £225,000 had been agreed with current Deepdale boss Les Chapman, and Mooney had watched his new team mates go down 2-0 at Goodison Park, which left Sunderland in 17th place, two positions away from the relegation zone. After completing the signing, Smith said:\n\nHe has tremendous skills – the lad can play. He generally plays wide on the right, but he can also play up front, so that should put a bit of pressure on the front two. Lots of clubs have fancied him, but I’ve put my money where my mouth is. There are quite a few things that Mooney can do – he now has to show he can turn it on consistently at a higher level.\n\nHowever, sadly for Smith, Mooney didn’t prove to be the ingredient Sunderland were lacking in 1990-91 (Ally McCoist, who was out of favour at Rangers and strongly linked with a move at the same time as Mooney, would surely have been a far better signing in the circumstances), and primarily due to a foot injury picked up in a win over relegation rivals Luton, he managed just five top flight starts as the club suffered relegation on the last day at Maine Road.\n\nFast forward two years from Mooney’s arrival, and Smith was long gone. After five games in his first season, Mooney had made only six starts in Division Two during the 1991-92 campaign – a perennial struggle with that injury picked up on Kenilworth Road’s plastic pitch meant he was rarely in contention for a game; his league appearances that campaign were at the tail end, with caretaker manager Malcolm Crosby desperately trying to manage a heavy fixture list ahead of an FA Cup Final appearance against Liverpool.\n\nThe following season was a struggle once more for Mooney, and the club as a whole. Crosby’s spell in charge wasn’t yielding the results he needed, and with Sunderland in the lower reaches of the division and struggling for form, a fit-again Mooney earned a recall prior to Christmas – and put together a good run of performances.\n\nAhead of a game that took place against Cambridge United on this day in 1993, Crosby’s assistant manager Bobby Ferguson was excited about what Mooney was – finally – bringing to the table.\n\nIt’s like having a new signing. I saw him in the reserves’ first game of the season and he seemed to have everything. Before the game at Luton, I said to him, ‘Anybody can get into the first team – the hard part is staying there. He’s told me that’s what he wants to do, so now he’s got to go out there, be positive, and make the most of what he’s got.\n\nSunderland, with Mooney playing an increasingly important role, had ended the year with just one defeat in six, and were looking up rather than down. Cambridge, who were managed by former Sunderland skipper Ian Atkins, were viewed as relegation candidates – but despite former manager John Beck’s departure, they still had a reputation for being a tough, aggressive, long-ball team. This was a game Sunderland, with Mooney hitting his straps, were expecting to win to kickstart a run to the playoffs.\n\nThe lads lined up in an unchanged 4-4-2, with a defence of John Kay, Kevin Ball, Terry Butcher and Richard Ord playing in front of Tony Norman. Mooney lined up on the right wing, with youngster Micky Gray on the left, amd Gordon Armstrong and Shaun Cunnington playing in the centre. Up front, David Rush partnered Don Goodman.\n\nFor the visitors, meanwhile, notable names in their line-up were former Sunderland centre back Micky Heathcote, and striker Steve Claridge.\n\nBut, it was Mooney, building on some excellent performances, who stole the show – setting up two and scoring one in an eventful 3-3 draw.\n\nOn his day, Mooney was the stereotypical tricky winger. He was a bit scruffy, had slouched shoulders, wasn’t particularly pacey but could turn defenders inside out – and this was his best day in a Sunderland shirt.\n\nAfter a couple of chances at either end, Mooney took this game by the scruff of the neck. He cleverly set up a shooting opportunity for big-money signing Cunnington, whose effort was deflected behind for a corner. From that corner, Cunnington’s header was cleared off the line for another corner. Armstrong took it, and Mooney’s fierce shot was deflected in to make it 1-0.\n\nThe lead lasted only a few moments. This Sunderland team weren’t the most defensively resolute, and Clayton equalised with a low drive into the bottom corner.\n\nMooney had another effort as the lads looked to regain the lead, but after carrying the ball forward dangerously his shot from distance failed to trouble keeper Vaughan. Seven minutes before the break, however, Sunderland went in front – David Rush was the scorer, Mooney the architect. The Irishman cut inside before sending over a perfect cross for the young striker to head home.\n\nSunderland should have extended the lead before half time, Cunnington and Goodman coming close, and Rush failing to pick out an unmarked Goodman as the home team tried to seize the advantage. Mooney was causing ’endless problems’ for the Cambridge defence, and after cleverly twisting and turning he created a yard and hit a left foot drive narrowly over the bar.\n\nThe second half continued as the first half had finished, and Heathcote playing excellently against his former teammates, heading away countless crosses and deadballs – including one from Armstrong after the ever threatening Mooney was brought down after a surging run.\n\nHowever, just after the hour, Cambridge equalised through Claridge from close range; Cunnington, and Goodman both came close to restoring the lead in the moments after the equaliser, as the game swung from end to end. And on 76 the lads took the lead once more – albeit in controversial circumstances. Mooney’s cross found Brian Atkinson, whose fierce shot hit the underside of the bar. The linesman flagged a goal, much to the fury of Cambridge, who were never opposed to berating the officials. The goal stood, but in the closing stages, Cambridge were back level, with Raynor shooting into the top corner.\n\nMooney had one goal and two assists to his name, and he almost won the game for the lads in the final exchanges – putting the ball wide from a tight angle after Rush had charged down the goalkeeper’s clearance. At the other end, meanwhile, future Millwall and Birmingham manager Gary Rowett could have claimed all three points for the U’s, but for a brilliant save from Norman. 3-3, and come the end of the season, both teams would be involved in a last-day scrap to avoid the final relegation place.\n\nThat was the highlight of Mooney’s Sunderland career. While he kept his place for a few more weeks, Crosby was sacked and Terry Butcher didn’t fancy him too much. He had a brief loan spell at Burnley – a move he was deeply opposed to given his Preston roots but Sunderland insisted upon it. Disillusioned, and aged just 27, he went back to Ireland and played out his career there.\n\nIn a 2020 interview looking back on his career, Mooney said his struggles at Sunderland were down to poor medical treatment – something that other players of the late 80s and early 90s have been critical of too.\n\nI was playing in the first team and I broke my foot down at Luton. It was misdiagnosed. It was just a metatarsal issue, I should only have been out for eight or nine weeks and I missed a whole season over it, because they kept forcing me back a little bit early. It kept breaking. It broke four times before they X-rayed it again and acknowledged it was broken. They were trying to push me back three or four weeks after resting it and it kept breaking in the same spot.\n\nSo I just got a bit disillusioned with the whole thing then. I felt I was being treated pretty poorly. I was saying it was broken, they were saying it wasn’t. At the end of the day, it ended up being broken. I missed just over a season, so I got fed up. I was 27 at that stage and I was just thinking: ‘I don’t really want to stay over here.’\n\nIt was the orthopaedic surgeon who said that it wasn’t broken. He had acknowledged there was a break initially and then right at the end of the season, Sunderland got relegated into the old Second Division. I came back pre-season and it broke again on hard ground. They X-rayed it at that time and they said it wasn’t broken. But I’d broke it in the same place and then it broke another three or four times after that. I missed the whole season, it was very frustrating, especially when I found out it was broken all along, so I got a bit disillusioned with it. I started making plans to come home then.”",

    "description": "Charlotte Patterson reports on why, if the right steps are taken, the Lasses can take centre stage in the North East!",
    "fullText": "The growth of women’s football in England has been one of the most significant sporting stories of the past decade. From the Lionesses’ triumphs to the rapid expansion of the Women’s Super League and the WSL2, the game has moved from the margins to the centre of the national sporting conversation.\n\nYet this growth hasn’t been uniform, and not every club has enjoyed the same surge in attendances or visibility.\n\nSunderland Women, a club with a proud history of developing elite talent and competing at the top level, have experienced a season in which attendances haven’t quite matched the broader sense of optimism surrounding the women’s game. Understanding why requires a nuanced look at several overlapping factors — from performances on the pitch to geographical realities, scheduling challenges and the shifting dynamics of football loyalties in the North East.\n\nSunderland’s women’s team has long been a paradox within the English game.\n\nOn one hand, the club has produced some of the finest players the country has seen, including Lucy Bronze, Jill Scott, Jordan Nobbs and Beth Mead. On the other, the team has often operated with weaker resources than many of its rivals — particularly since the restructuring of the women’s pyramid and the rise of heavily backed clubs.\n\nThis tension between heritage and modern competitiveness forms part of the backdrop to the question of attendance. Supporters in the North East are passionate, loyal and deeply knowledgeable, but they’re also discerning, and when a team isn’t consistently competing at the very top, it can be harder to attract casual fans or those who are new to the women’s game.\n\nPerformance isn’t the only factor, but it’s certainly one of the most visible.\n\nSunderland Women have enjoyed periods of strong form but they’ve also experienced inconsistency and in a league where momentum is everything, this can affect the size and enthusiasm of the crowd. Supporters are more likely to attend regularly when they feel they’re watching a team on an upward trajectory — one that’s pushing for promotion or challenging the established order.\n\nWhen results fluctuate, the emotional pull weakens slightly, especially for those who aren’talready deeply invested in the club. This isn’t unique to Sunderland — it’s a pattern seen across the women’s game, where attendances often correlate with league position, ambition and the sense of a club moving forward.\n\nHowever, to attribute the attendance issue solely to performances would be to overlook the broader context, as geography plays a significant role in shaping the matchday experience.\n\nSunderland Women play their home games at Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground in Hetton-le-Hole, a venue with a strong community feel but one that isn’t always the easiest for supporters to reach.\n\nFor fans living in Sunderland itself, the journey to Hetton can be inconvenient — particularly for those relying on public transport — and for supporters from further afield such as Newcastle or Durham, the location may feel even less accessible. In an era where convenience matters more than ever, especially for families and younger fans, the location of the ground can be a decisive factor.\n\nThe contrast with other clubs in the region is instructive.\n\nNewcastle United Women, for example, have benefited enormously from the decision to stage several fixtures at St James’ Park. The symbolism of playing at the men’s stadium, combined with the novelty factor and the club’s broader resurgence, has created a sense of occasion that draws in thousands of supporters who might not otherwise attend a women’s match.\n\nEven when Newcastle Women play at Kingston Park, the venue is still relatively central and well connected, whilst Durham Women have built a strong identity around their home at Maiden Castle, and although it isn’t in the city centre, it’s closely tied to the university community and benefits from a stable, loyal fanbase.\n\nSunderland’s situation is different. Eppleton is a ground blessed with character but it doesn’t have the same pull as a major stadium, nor does it sit within a large student population or a bustling urban centre.\n\nFor longstanding fans, the location may not be an issue but for the casual supporter or the family looking for an easy day out, it can be a barrier. The club has made efforts to promote fixtures and engage with the community, but the physical reality of the venue remains a challenge.\n\nScheduling is another factor that can’t be ignored, as women’s football fixtures often take place at times that are designed to avoid clashes with men’s matches, television broadcasts or other major sporting events.\n\nAlthough this is understandable from a logistical standpoint, it can result in kick off times that aren’t ideal for supporters.\n\nEarly Sunday afternoons, for example, can be difficult for families with other commitments, whereas midweek fixtures can be challenging for those who work irregular hours or rely on public transport. Sunderland Women have played their share of games at times that don’t necessarily maximise attendance potential, and this is compounded by the travel considerations already mentioned.\n\nThe broader landscape of women’s football in the North East also plays a role, and the region is unique in that it has three prominent women’s teams — Sunderland, Newcastle and Durham — each of whom boasts its own identity, ambitions and fanbase.\n\nIn recent years, Newcastle Women have captured a significant amount of attention, fuelled by the momentum of the men’s team, increased investment, and the novelty of large‑scale fixtures at St James’ Park. For many supporters in the region, especially younger fans or those new to the women’s game, Newcastle may feel like the more exciting or accessible option. The club’s marketing has been strong, and the sense of being part of a growing movement has resonated with supporters.\n\nDurham Women, meanwhile, have carved out a niche as a stable, community‑focused club with a clear identity and a loyal following. Their matches often attract consistent crowds and their connection to the university gives them a built‑in audience that Sunderland can’t easily replicate. For neutral fans or those without a strong allegiance, Durham may offer a more convenient or appealing matchday experience.\n\nThese factors create a competitive environment in which Sunderland Women must work harder to attract and retain supporters.\n\nThe club’s history and identity are strong but in the current landscape, history alone isn’t always enough to draw large crowds. Supporters have more options than ever before, and the rise of Newcastle Women in particular has shifted the balance of attention in the region.\n\nAnother element worth considering is the visibility and marketing of the team, and while Sunderland AFC has a large and passionate fanbase, the women’s team doesn’t always receive the same level of promotion as some of its rivals.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily due to a lack of effort, but rather the reality of competing for attention within a club structure where the men’s team dominates the narrative. When Newcastle Women play at St James’ Park, the event is heavily publicised (often weeks in advance) and the sense of occasion is amplified by the scale of the venue. However, Sunderland Women, playing at a smaller ground, don’t have the same platform, and this can affect the reach of their promotional efforts.\n\nMedia coverage also plays a role. Local press attention for women’s football has improved, but it’s still uneven, and clubs with larger or more dramatic storylines tend to receive more coverage.\n\nNewcastle’s rise has created a compelling narrative and Durham’s stability has earned them respect, but Sunderland’s story has been more complex, shaped by financial constraints, league restructuring and the challenge of rebuilding. This complexity doesn’t always translate into headlines and without consistent media visibility, it can be harder to attract new supporters.\n\nThere’s also the question of expectations.\n\nSunderland Women were once one of the dominant forces in English women’s football and for longtime supporters, the memory of competing at the highest level remains vivid.\n\nWhen the team isn’t challenging for promotion or pushing the top sides, there can be a sense of frustration or disappointment — even if the performances are solid. This emotional context can influence attendance, as supporters may feel less inclined to attend regularly when the team isn’t perceived to be fulfilling its potential.\n\nAt the same time, it’s important to recognise that the women’s game is still evolving, and attendance patterns aren’t fixed.\n\nSunderland Women has a strong foundation, a committed core of supporters and a history that few clubs can match. The challenge is to translate these strengths into consistent attendance growth — and that requires a multifaceted approach. Improving performances on the pitch will always help, but so too will addressing the practical barriers that affect supporters’ ability to attend matches.\n\nOne potential avenue is exploring opportunities to play occasional fixtures at the Stadium of Light.\n\nAlthough this may not be feasible for every match, staging selected games at the main stadium could create a sense of occasion similar to that which Newcastle have achieved. It would also make the matches more accessible for supporters in Sunderland and could attract new fans who are curious about the women’s team but haven’t yet made the trip to Hetton. The club has experimented with this in the past, and expanding these efforts could be a valuable step.\n\nAnother area of focus could be enhancing the matchday experience at Eppleton.\n\nWhile the ground has its limitations, it also has the potential to offer a welcoming, community‑driven atmosphere that appeals to families and younger supporters. Improving facilities, increasing engagement activities and creating a more vibrant environment could help to offset the challenges of the location.\n\nCommunity outreach is also crucial.\n\nSunderland is a city with a deep-seated footballing culture, and there’s significant potential to build stronger connections between the women’s team and local schools, youth clubs and community groups. The more visible the players are within the community, the more likely it is that supporters will feel a personal connection to the team — and that this can translate into higher attendances.\n\nUltimately, the question of why Sunderland Women’s attendances haven’t been as strong as many hoped this season doesn’t have a single answer.\n\nIt’s a combination of performances, location, scheduling, competition from other local teams and the broader dynamics of the women’s game. Each factor plays a part; together they create a complex landscape that the club must navigate, yet there’s also reason for optimism.\n\nThe women’s game continues to grow, and Sunderland Women remain an important part of that story.\n\nWith strategic planning, community engagement and continued investment, the club has the potential to increase attendances and re‑establish itself as a major force in the region. The passion of the North East for football is unmatched and there’s no reason that Sunderland Women can’t tap into that passion more effectively in the seasons to come.\n\nThe challenge now is to build on the foundations that already exist, address the barriers that have held attendances back and create a compelling vision for the future. If the club can do that, there’s every chance that the stands will begin to fill once again and that Sunderland Women will take their rightful place at the heart of the region’s footballing landscape.",

    "fullText": "Every once in a while, even at our highest point arguably for decades, Sunderland AFC love to administer a well-timed punch in the gut just to keep everyone on our toes, and Wednesday night’s trip to Brentford was a textbook example.\n\nJust as the post-Christmas cobwebs were almost blown off, the fixture list threw up a second London away game in four days. I deliberated for some time whether to take any leave for this one, either to get to the pub early or to enjoy a post-game lie-in on Thursday, and in the end opted for neither, reasoning that a short trip to the other side of the capital is not a sensible use of paid holiday. At least my future self will be grateful for that, but the present version thinks the past one is a bastard.\n\nAnyway, I was at least able to steal out of the office earlier than usual having started early and headed post-haste to the Rose and Crown in Kew Green where the branch would be congregating. Some of the club’s media team were present to interview some of us about our experiences following the Lads from the capital and predictions for the game. You can have a read of our chairman Matthew’s thoughts here.\n\nShameless plug over, time to focus on the football. Brentford would inevitably present a tough proposition, having surged in December from lower mid-table to sit above us in the league on goal difference. Their in-form forward Igor Thiago clearly took it personally after I removed him from my fantasy league team, smashing in a hat-trick against Everton, but our defence has handled similarly dangerous strikers this season quite well, so we hoped we might manage to keep him quiet.\n\nThe Gtech Community Stadium is of course a new ground for Sunderland, so that on its own was enough of a reason to tempt so many to make the long journey south. It was a short walk from Kew Green across the river to the stadium; this really would be a lovely trip if it weren’t on a freezing midweek night in early January. The stewards wouldn’t have been out of place working in government security, going through everyone’s wallets with a fine-toothed comb, but thankfully we made it to our seats in time for kick-off.\n\nThe compact away end actually made for a great atmosphere – far better than at Spurs on Sunday – as chants from the fans were able to carry across and be picked up much more easily. Brentford played their incredibly unoriginal anthem to the tune of “Hey Jude”, and the Lads kicked off in blue and white attacking the far end. The opening exchanges were relatively even, but then Brentford began to turn the screw, and our defence was split apart far too easily as Thiago rounded Roefs to make it 1-0.\n\nWe made it in at half-time with just a single-goal deficit, and over a pint of London Pride we reasoned that a second-half improvement similar to what we produced at Spurs should see us claim at least a point.\n\nA golden opportunity to level was presented to us after Brobbey did brilliantly to win a penalty, but I was hesitant to celebrate too much given Brentford keeper Kelleher’s excellent record from the spot. In the end Le Fée’s ridiculous Panenka attempt could probably have been saved by anyone from the away end, even those who’d spent four hours on the train with a crate of Cruzcampo. It was a bizarre moment of idiocy from a brilliant player, and we can only hope he learns the requisite lessons from it.\n\nI would argue that it was the manner of the missed penalty rather than the miss itself that spurred Brentford on to such a degree and completely dashed the wind from our sails. The second goal was frankly embarrassing to watch as we were let out of jail initially when the ball hit the crossbar, only for our defence to fail to pick up Thiago again as he headed low into the corner. Brentford’s third was the kind of sloppy goal teams concede when their heads have completely dropped. We huffed and puffed, and a few of last season’s heroes in the shape of Neil and O’Nien were given a run-out, but the game was long since done as a contest.\n\nBack at the packed Express Tavern waiting for the Tube traffic to die down, we were given a brief morale boost as Leeds took the lead at St James’ Park, only for the Mags to overturn the deficit and climb above us in the table for the first time this season.\n\nAll in all it was a pretty miserable night, but there are obvious mitigating factors. This was simply a game too far for a squad that has been stretched beyond its limits by injury and international call-ups. The cup game at the weekend will likely be seen as a chance for mass rotation, and while it is a shame to essentially sacrifice our only slim chance at silverware for the season, it seems to be the only logical approach in the circumstances. This team has bounced back many times before, and with the imminent reinforcements from Africa incoming, you’d back them to do it again.",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza vs. Dante Moore: The key stats you need to know in 2026 NFL Draft debate originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza and Dante Moore didn't have much of a Big Ten quarterback duel when Indiana beat Oregon in the college football regular season. But now that both QBs have led their teams to playoff semifinals, a lot more is at stake.\n\nWhen Mendoza's Hoosiers have their rematch with Moore's Ducks in Friday's Peach Bowl in Atlanta, there will be a trip to the national championship game at stake. The outcome and the related performances will also help determine which QB goes to the top of the draft class in 2026.\n\nWith the Las Vegas Raiders and New York Jets having the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks and badly needing quarterbacks, the franchises will spend a lot of time on vetting Mendoza vs. Moore.\n\nBetween arm strength, accuracy, pocket presence and intangibles, there's a lot to like about Mendoza (6-5, 225), the Heisman Trophy winner, and Moore, a well-rounded talent. But their head-to-head stats will no doubt have some influence on who ends up coming off the board first.\n\nHere's looking at their seasons before playing again, including what happened in the previous matchup on Oct. 11:\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT: Where Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore land in latest projections\n\nMoore had more volume, but in terms of efficiency and every other category, Mendoza stood out as the worthy Heisman winner, with Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Ohio State's Julian Sayin making the cut over Moore as finalists. Neither Mendoza nor Moore would be considered dual threats with their running, but they have enough wheels to extend pass plays and rush for key yardage in big moments.\n\nHere are the numbers both QBs put when facing each other's tough defenses back on Oct. 11, played at Oregon's Autzen Stadium:\n\nThat wasn't the best showcase game for either QB, given the respective degrees of difficulty. Mendoza did outplay Moore. Expect both QBs to perform much better as more seasoned and playoff-winning passers almost three months later.\n\nMORE: Five players to watch in the Indiana vs. Oregon CPF semifinal\n\nThe Raiders already are on the clock for April 23 in Pittsburgh. Given the influence of former Big Ten passer Tom Brady as part-owner, he has a tough decision to make for the new face of the franchise. Mendoza, given his gritty profile and clutch confidence, would seem to fit better as the Raiders' savior.\n\nMoore, meanwhile, might be the right QB on whom the Jets can take a shot with his mental and physical attributes to deliver for Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand, who coached Jared Goff in Detroit. Another QB such as Alabama's Ty Simpson could emerge in the conversation, but for now, Mendoza is the man.\n\nThere's a long way to go in the draft process, however, including the Combine and pro days. Mendoza vs. Moore started off mild, but it's become red-hot on the biggest stages.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal",

    "description": "I would love to see Speakman and Ghisolfi deliver another recruitment masterclass before the transfer window closes, but I am totally relaxed about the prospect of finishing the season with the players we currently have.",
    "fullText": "It’s the January transfer window, traditionally a time of angst for long-suffering Sunderland supporters. In recent years we have been scrabbling around to fill gaps in the squad – the elusive “proven striker”, a battle-hardened centre-half to help with a defensive injury crisis, or a midfield maestro to replace a stricken Corry Evans.\n\nThis season is different and, for once, I am not actually worried whether or not we sign anyone in this transfer window. Don’t get me wrong – in years gone by Sunderland have picked up some January gems. Last year it was Enzo Le Fée – a transfer that literally no one saw coming. Could Championship Sunderland prise such a supremely talented midfielder away from Serie A? Thankfully we had an ace in the pack – the relationship between Le Fée and his fellow Frenchman Régis Le Bris proved crucial as we completed an improbable acquisition.\n\nTen years previously, January 2015 heralded the arrival of a genuine Sunderland legend. In what could properly be described as the heist of the century, Jozy Altidore headed to the MLS to join Toronto while Jermain Defoe arrived on Wearside from the opposite direction.\n\nOther than January 2022, which heralded the arrival of Jack Clarke, Patrick Roberts, and a young Irish lad by the name of Trai Hume, and the previous year when the Loch Ness Drogba signed, winter transfer windows have been more Will Grigg and Jaden Danns than anything exciting.\n\nBut that is not why I am so relaxed about this transfer window. It is more that improving the current squad is going to be very difficult in what is a notoriously challenging January market.\n\nI am setting myself up to be shot at but, in my view, when the AFCON players return we will be going into the second half of the season with a stronger squad at Le Bris’ disposal than he had in August.\n\nWhen the season kicked off with a resounding thumping of West Ham, Nordi Mukiele, Brian Brobbey, Bertrand Traoré, and Lutsharel Geertruida were still to sign. It was a month before Brobbey or Geertruida made their debuts against Crystal Palace, and Traoré first appeared two weeks later.\n\nThey joined a squad with Dennis Cirkin and Romaine Mundle sidelined by long-term injuries.\n\nFast forward to now and the picture is very different – Mundle and Cirkin are both fit, with the latter putting in creditable performances against Manchester City and Spurs in the AFCON absence of Reinildo.\n\nBrobbey completed his first full 90 minutes against Tottenham in addition to his thumping finish, and the burly and brutal Dutch striker is looking very much the part of an effective Premier League hitman. What he probably needs is someone to get closer to him, as Enzo Le Fée did to create his goal.\n\nI have seen calls for the signing of a right-winger – I am not joining in with them. Bertrand Traoré is likely to return this week, and the relative veteran has clearly been delivering what Régis Le Bris wants in his system, having established himself as a regular starter. In addition Eliezer Mayenda has shown enough threat against Manchester City and Tottenham that he offers a genuine option to replace Traoré in the latter stages. He also has the potential of playing closer to Brobbey as a second striker.\n\nElsewhere there are no obvious gaps – Roefs is firmly established between the sticks. Defensive options are strong – Hume, Geertruida, Mukiele, Ballard, Alderete, Reinildo, and Cirkin are all fit and available. In midfield Xhaka, Diarra, Sadiki, and Le Fée will cause a selection headache for Le Bris, with Geertruida and Rigg able to step in.\n\nOn the left wing Simon Adingra is starting to show why we were happy to trade him for Tommy Watson; Chemsdine Talbi has already demonstrated the threat that he brings. Romaine Mundle is still getting to grips with Premier League-standard defenders but has already shown that he can deliver the defensive graft that Le Bris’ system demands.\n\nIf I had to pick one position I would like to see strengthened in this window, it would be another central midfielder. But where the hell do you find another Granit Xhaka?\n\nBefore anyone slings the “lack of ambition” accusation at me, let me say this clearly – if there is a player (or players) out there available at a not-extortionate price, let’s go and get them. Offer me another Le Fée or a Defoe and I’ll snap your hand off (up to the elbow!).\n\nBut I don’t expect that the Louis-Dreyfus regime will sanction any acquisition unless it is a player who will genuinely improve the squad and, such is the quality now available to Régis Le Bris, that will not be easy.\n\nJust as importantly, any new arrival will have to possess the right character to fit comfortably into the mentality of the squad that Le Bris has so carefully curated, incorporating the best of the squad that achieved promotion with the high-quality summer signings, and fully buy into the “’Til the end” spirit that typifies the Sunderland of 2026.\n\nI would love to see Speakman and Ghisolfi deliver another recruitment masterclass before the transfer window closes, but I am totally relaxed about the prospect of finishing the season with the players we currently have. Without the AFCON contingent we have held our own. With them back in the fold, no one will relish facing the Black Cats.",

Malkin scored in his first game since Dec. 4, notching his ninth goal of the season and the 523rd of his career.\n\nNot surprisingly, the three-time Stanley Cup champion got plenty of love from Pittsburgh fans in his return to the ice, especially after scoring.\n\nAfter the game, Malkin praised Penguins fans for their support and gave the Steelers a special shout-out ahead of their upcoming playoff game against the Houston Texans.\n\nEvgeni Malkin: \"Love our fans. Always amazing to play at home. Thanks to all the fans… Steelers play Monday. People love sports here. Good luck to Steelers, too, as well.\"\n\n— Pens Inside Scoop (@PensInsideScoop) January 9, 2026\n\n“Love our fans. Always amazing to play at home. Thanks to all the fans,” Malkin told reporters after the game. “Steelers play Monday. People love sports here. Good luck to the Steelers, too, as well.”\n\nNow in his 20th season with the Penguins, Malkin knows how special Pittsburgh fans are and how passionate they are about their sports teams. He’s given them plenty to cheer for during his two decades with the Penguins, including another win and goal on Thursday night.\n\nMeanwhile, the Steelers are preparing to host the Texans on Monday in the Wild Card Round. They just clinched the AFC North in Week 18 with a wild win over the Baltimore Ravens, so they’re hoping to replicate that success on Monday and earn their first postseason win in nine years.\n\nMore Penguins: Penguins Announce Roster Move Ahead Of Matchup Vs.

    "description": "Hendricks led the MAC in receiving yards in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Ohio Bobcats won 30 games across the past three seasons and one player pertinent to that success is headed elsewhere.\n\nOhio’s star wide receiver Chase Hendricks found his transfer portal destination, committing to California after three years as a Bobcat. In three seasons, Hendricks accumulated 1,616 yards and eight touchdowns on 122 receptions, with the majority of his production transpiring in 2024.\n\nHendricks led the entire MAC in receiving yards at 1,037 in a breakout 2025 campaign, while also checking in at second in the conference in receptions (71) and tied for fourth in receiving touchdowns (7). He served as the overwhelming No. 1 target for the 9-4 Bobcats, as the next closest teammate had 30 receptions and 419 yards receiving. 2025 marked Hendricks’ first year in the WR1 role, and it was clear from the opening drive in Week 1 that he’d be poised for a stellar season.\n\nHe produced 100 receiving yards in six of his first eight games this season and snagged 8+ receptions five times (maxing out at 10 vs. Northern Illinois and Eastern Michigan). Hendricks concluded his three-year Ohio stint with an 87-yard outing in a Frisco Bowl victory over UNLV, which represented the Bobcats’ sixth-straight bowl win.\n\nIn 2024, Hendricks was second on the team in receptions (40) and receiving yards (471) for a MAC champion Ohio team. He also earned playing time as a true freshman in 2023, recording 11 catches and 108 yards for a 10-3 Bobcat squad.\n\nThe St. Louis, MO native heads west to California where he joins a loaded Golden Bears receiving corps that features Rutgers transfer Ian Strong and 2025 FBS receptions leader Jacob De Jesus. As for Ohio, the Bobcats now must find a new No. 1 wide receiver — and 2026 will present the team’s fourth different receiving yards leader in four years. Ohio’s second-leading receiver Rodney Harris II is also in the transfer portal, leaving Dom Dorwart (11 receptions and 119 receiving yards in 2025) as the leading returner in production.",

    "description": "No. 1 Fishers gets buzzer beater (times two) to roll to big lead over No. 4 Pike. Red Devils' rally falls short.",
    "fullText": "FISHERS – For three quarters, No. 1 Fishers delivered about as clear of a statement as possible against fourth-ranked Pike, especially considering its most talented player was on the bench in street clothes.\n\nThe fourth quarter? Well, that is something Fishers’ coach Garrett Winegar can use as motivation in practice. A myriad of turnovers and mistakes against Pike’s full-court press turned a blowout in a relatively close 76-67 Tigers’ win on Thursday night in front of a packed gym.\n\n“I think this game added a little bit of fire to us,” said Fishers junior guard Cooper Zachary, who drained two near-replica shots from just inside halfcourt at the end of the first and second quarters. “Just because everyone is like, ‘Pike, Crown Point, Fishers – who is No. 1?’ It’s kind of a three-way race. So tonight felt like a way to end that talk for one of the teams. And I think we did a good job of that until the fourth quarter.”\n\nFishers (11-0) led from the outset, going ahead by as many as 13 points early in the second quarter before Pike pulled within five on a basket by Landon Lampley. But the Tigers dominated the final two minutes of the first half, punctuated by Zachary’s 3-pointer from just inside the halfcourt line to give his team a 38-23 lead going into the break.\n\nThe shot was remarkably similar to the shot Zachary hit as the first quarter ended.\n\n“I think his percentage right now is better from 45 feet than anywhere else,” Fishers coach Garrett Winegar joked. “He’s got ‘in the gym’ range and he has ultimate freedom from us. He’s earned that. He’s puts in the time. No one works harder than him in the state and I can guarantee that. It’s pretty simple in those situations that he needs to get the ball.”\n\nFishers carried that momentum into the second half and looked to be on the verge of running away with the game, leading by as many as 22 points in the third quarter and taking a 63-45 lead into the fourth.\n\nThen, T.J. Davis happened. The 5-9 senior sparked the Red Devils (9-2) on offense and defense, finishing with a team-high 20 points and two steals. Pike’s zone press created all kinds of issues for Fishers, which was playing without star junior guard Jason Gardner Jr. for the sixth consecutive game as he recovers from a broken bone in his left hand.\n\nPike pulled as close as seven points but ran out of time. Fishers finished with a whopping 25 turnovers.\n\n“I feel like that was good for us,” Zachary said of the fourth quarter. “What do we get out of a 30-point win? Everyone on our team probably would have been like, ‘Well, we just beat Pike by 30,’ and get too high on ourselves. But now we can see that even in a big win like that, we still have work to do.”\n\nEthan Hillsman, a 6-7 senior who just became eligible last weekend, led Fishers with 20 points on 8-for-11 shooting, including a pair of 3-pointers. Senior Kai McGrew added 16 points, 11 rebounds, three assists and three blocked shots and Levi Walker had 15 points and six rebounds. Zachary was also in double figures with 12 points, all on 3s.\n\n“We’re without our one-man press breaker right now,” Winegar said of Gardner. “Honestly, it’s probably on me that I didn’t do more work to prepare for that situation. We have press breakers but we have new guys working in the lineups. We probably did a bad job with that. And we talked about playing with emotion, not being emotional. I thought we went the opposite of that and played emotional.”\n\nThe loss came just two days after Pike narrowly avoided defeat in a 48-44 overtime win over Noblesville. In addition to Davis, the Red Devils were led by sophomore Landon Lampley’s 14 points and seven rebounds, Jahari Miller’s 13 points, four steals and four rebounds and Kenneth Lampley’s 10 points and two steals.\n\nPike had an eight-game winning streak coming into Thursday’s game and had not lost to an in-state team. The only previous loss came to Wisconsin Lutheran, 68-65 in overtime, the night before Thanksgiving.\n\n“That’s a good team and they are playing at home,” Pike coach Jeff Teague said. “That was probably the biggest crowd we’ve played in front of. We’re a young team, but it’s a good experience for them to play a team that’s well trained and like a well-oiled machine.”\n\nPike will get back to it next week in the Marion County Tournament, opening at Brebeuf Jesuit on Tuesday in the first round. The Red Devils might have found something in the fourth quarter that can carry over.\n\n“We have a lot of work to do,” Davis said. “We’re not there yet. But we’ll get back at it at practice (on Friday). If we played like we did in the fourth quarter, we would have won. But we just started so slow.”\n\nFishers will play on Saturday against Cardinal Ritter (Mo.) at Highland, Ill.\n\nWith the Indiana-Oregon Peach Bowl game on Friday, several games were moved to Thursday to make for a busier night than usual. Some of the other games of note:\n\n*Hamilton Southeastern rallied for a 66-64 road win over Lawrence Central to improve to 5-6. Landon Osswald led HSE with 18 points. Luke Weemer added 17 points and Varschon Clark had 15 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n\n*Class 4A No. 7 Plainfield defeated Avon 75-36 and Brownsburg knocked off Tri-West 66-45 to set up the Hendricks County Tournament championship matchup for Saturday night at Danville. Plainfield will play Brownsburg at about 7:45 p.m., following the girls’ championship.\n\n*University defeated Scecina 67-63 in overtime, rallying from a 10-point fourth quarter deficit. Josh Henderson scored 17 points to lead four players in double figures for University, which improved to 8-3. Scecina (6-3) was led by 27 points from senior Bryce Mathis.\n\n*Standout sophomore Noah Washington scored 30 points as New Albany rolled to a 79-56 win over rival Jeffersonville.\n\nCall Star reporter Kyle Neddenriep at (317) 444-6649.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOle Miss players likely didn’t spend their College Football Playoff run wondering what former coach Lane Kiffin was up to or what he had to say, but the rest of the college football world has had just about no escape from Kiffin since he bolted for LSU in November.\n\nThe highly paid coach has long been active on social media, even amid a tumultuous few weeks that saw him leave Oxford for Baton Rouge, and he followed Ole Miss’ journey to the semifinals every step of the way.\n\nAfter the Rebels lost a thrilling Fiesta Bowl on Thursday night and saw their run come to an end, Kiffin reacted on X.\n\nHere’s a look at what Kiffin had to say about his former team and the officials after Ole Miss was eliminated.\n\nMORE:Why Lane Kiffin left Ole Miss for LSU\n\nKiffin tweeted a broken heart gif after Ole Miss' defeat, but he praised the Rebels for \"amazing effort and grit\" despite the loss.\n\n\"Best season ever in the history of Ole Miss!!\" Kiffin said, certainly remembering that he was part of it for the first 12 games.\n\nOnce the dust settled, though, Kiffin had a bone to pick with the officials for their decision not to call a penalty on the final play of the game.\n\nKiffin argued De'Zhaun Stribling was interfered with on Ole Miss' Hail Mary attempt at the end of the fourth quarter, with replay showing Stribling grabbed by a defender and at least partly pulled down.\n\nPass interference 💯!!! https://t.co/99jrGosJ5w\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) January 9, 2026\n\nPass interference calls are generally rare on Hail Mary attempts because of the amount of hand fighting that is naturally part of a scrum, but some on Ole Miss' side — including coach Pete Golding, who gestured toward the officials when the clock struck zero — believed Miami put the Stribling at enough of a disadvantage to necessitate a penalty.\n\nMORE:Explaining the no-call at end of Fiesta Bowl\n\nWhile Miami will play on, Ole Miss' loss might be some final closure on what became a months-long saga with Lane Kiffin at the center. Kiffin and LSU will focus on the 2026 season, while Golding will get the chance to fully prepare for his first season at Ole Miss once he finds out whether Trinidad Chambliss will be his quarterback.",

    "description": "Humans can accurately sense the position, speed, and torque of their limbs, even with their eyes shut. This sense, known as proprioception, allows humans to pr…",
    "fullText": "Today’s conventional prosthetic limbs do not provide feedback to the nervous system. Because of this, people with amputated limbs cannot feel the position, speed, and torque of their prosthetic joints without looking at them, making it difficult to control their movement. In order to create a more complete prosthetic control experience, researchers at the MIT Media Lab invented the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI). The AMI is a method to restore proprioception to persons with amputation.\n\nProprioception in people with intact biological limbs is mediated by biological sensors in muscles acting in opposition to each other in relation to a single joint. To replicate this feedback in an amputated residuum, an AMI is made up of two muscles – an agonist and an antagonist – connected mechanically; when the agonist contracts, the antagonist is stretched, and vice versa. The purpose of an AMI is to control and interpret proprioceptive feedback from a bionic joint. During an amputation procedure, a surgeon creates AMIs by linking together muscle pairs within the amputated residuum. Multiple AMI muscle pairs can be created for the control and sensation of multiple prosthetic joints. Artificial muscle electrodes placed over each AMI muscle communicate with small computers within an advanced bionic limb that control movement of the bionic joints. As the bionic limb moves, the AMIs enable a person with limb amputation to feel its positions and movements. The AMI was validated in extensive pre-clinical experimentation at MIT, prior to surgical implementation in a human patient at Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospital and bionic implementation at MIT.\n\nIn the first human implementation of the AMI, discussed in a paper recently published in Science Translational Medicine (May 30, 2018), we surgically constructed two AMIs within the residual limb of a patient at the time of his below-knee amputation. Each AMI sends control signals to one joint of a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis, and provides proprioceptive information pertaining to the movement of that joint back to the patient’s central nervous system. When the patient moves his phantom limb, the re-connected muscles move naturally in dynamic pairs, sending proprioceptive information through nerves to his brain. He consequently experiences natural sensations of ankle-foot positions and movements even when blindfolded. This AMI patient has better intentional control over movement of a bionic prosthesis, compared to a group of patients with traditional amputation. In addition, when he walks up and down stairs all the natural movement patterns mediated by the central nervous system emerge through his synthetic limb as an involuntary, reflexive behavior. In these trials, the intricacies of natural foot placement during stair ascent and descent emerged before our eyes, without the patient consciously trying to move his bionic limb. Furthermore, we describe the first-ever system for closed-loop joint control with natural neural feedback of prosthetic joint torque, and show that this system improves function.\n\nIn addition to these functional improvements, the AMI patient also moves and behaves as though the bionic limb is part of him. After a few minutes of wearing it for the first time, we asked the patient to describe his relationship with the device, and he said, “The robot became part of me.” Because the patient’s nervous system was connected to the prosthesis in a bi-directional manner, neurological embodiment was achieved.  This is an example of a design paradigm that we call NeuroEmbodied Design. In this design process, the designer designs human flesh and bone–the biological body itself–along with synthetics, to enhance bi-directional communication between a human’s nervous system and the built world. “Previously humans have used technology in a tool-like fashion,” senior author and project director Professor Hugh Herr says. “We are now starting to see a new era of human-device interaction, of full neurological embodiment, in which what we design becomes truly part of us, part of our identity.”  We see a future in which our designed world will be carefully integrated within our nature: a world in which what is biological and what is not, what is human and what is not, what is nature and what is not, will be forever blurred.\n\nJim Ewing, the first patient to undergo an AMI procedure, was injured several years ago while rock climbing in the Cayman Islands. The surgical operation he underwent, in which AMIs were implemented from native muscles at the time of below-knee amputation, was named the \"Ewing Amputation\" in his honor. Rebuilt as a cyborg, Jim returned to the Caymans to climb once again.",

    "fullText": "Google is adding more Gemini features to Gmail, providing upgrades like artificial intelligence-generated summaries of email threads, the company said Thursday.\n\nThe company said its latest updates will be rolled out in phases, and some features will be turned on by default in inboxes, meaning users who don't want them will have to opt out.\n\n\"When you open an email with dozens of replies, Gmail synthesizes the entire conversation into a concise summary of key points,\" Google wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe company said AI Overviews, which show up at the top of search results, are also being added to Gmail.\n\nThe updates come as Google embeds its Gemini AI technology across its wide portfolio of consumer products. Google is counting on its massive customer base to provide an advantage as the company takes on the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic and others in the booming generative AI market.\n\nGoogle says Gmail now has more than 3 billion users.\n\nLast year, Google's Gemini integration in Gmail allowed users to do things like search messages, draft emails from prompts, improve grammar and generate custom responses.\n\nOne of the new features is \"Suggested Replies,\" which Google says uses the context of a user's emails to create one-click responses. It's an update to a prior tool called \"Smart Replies.\" The company is also upgrading a proofreading option for checking grammar and making messages more concise.\n\nDriven by its rapid advancements in AI, Google parent Alphabet topped Apple by market cap on Wednesday for the first time since 2019, continuing a rally that made the stock the best performer among tech megacaps last year. Meanwhile, OpenAI soared to a private market valuation of $500 billion late last year, and Anthropic said Wednesday that it's valued at $350 billion in a new funding round.\n\n— CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this report.\n\nWATCH: How Gemini is gaining ground on ChatGPT",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - India's finance ministry plans to scrap five-year-old restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts, two sources said, as New Delhi seeks ​to revive commercial ties in an environment of eased diplomatic and border tensions.\n\nThe curbs, imposed in 2020 ‌after a deadly clash between the countries' troops, required Chinese bidders to register with an Indian government committee and obtain political and security clearances.\n\nThe ‌measures effectively barred Chinese firms from competing for Indian government contracts that were estimated to be worth $700 billion to $750 billion.\n\n\"Officials are working to remove the registration requirement for bidders from bordering nations,\" one government source said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nThe final decision will be made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office, both the ⁠sources said.\n\nThe restrictions had a significant ‌impact: Months after they were unveiled, China's state-owned CRRC was disqualified from bidding for a $216 million train-manufacturing contract.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance's plan to ease curbs followed requests from other government departments ‍that are facing shortages and project delays due to the 2020 restrictions.\n\n\"Several ministries have requested exemptions to overcome the constraints that could derail projects in their sectors,\" the second government source said.\n\nSoon after India imposed its restrictions, the value of new projects awarded to ‌Chinese bidders fell 27% from a year earlier to $1.67 billion in 2021, according to a 2024 report from the Observer Research Foundation.\n\nSpecifically, curbs on imports from China of equipment for the power sector have hindered India's plans to raise its thermal power capacity to about 307 GW over the next decade.\n\nA high-level committee headed by a former cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, has also recommended easing the restrictions. Gauba is now a member of a top government think tank.\n\nIndia's finance ministry ⁠and the prime minister's office did not respond to Reuters requests ​for comment.\n\nLast year, Modi visited China for the first time in ​seven years and agreed to foster deeper commercial ties with Beijing following U.S. President Donald Trump's 50% punitive tariff on Indian goods and in light of Washington's warming relations with Pakistan.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A complicated crime scene and uncooperative witnesses hindered Salt Lake City police efforts to investigate a fatal shooting outside a house of worship belonging to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nThe shooting in a church parking lot Wednesday night left two people dead and six injured, including five who remained hospitalized with police protection Thursday. Investigators said the shooting erupted from a dispute between people who knew each other and were attending a funeral.\n\nNo arrests had been made as of early Thursday evening. Authorities say they do not know whether the shooting was gang-related and that they are having trouble getting witnesses to cooperate.\n\nPolice do not believe the shooting was random or motivated by animus against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church.\n\n“Our houses of worship are sacred, whatever the affiliation,” Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said Thursday. “We should all protect those spaces. We should all respect those spaces.”\n\nAll the shooting victims were adults. Vaea Tulikihihifo, 46, and Sione Vatuvei, 38, were identified as the two people killed.\n\nThe red brick church in northwest Salt Lake City mostly serves Tongan congregants and holds regular worship services in their native tongue, according to its website.\n\nLatter-day Saint missionaries first arrived in Tonga in the early 1890s, according to the church’s website. At first, they had little success and the mission closed in 1897. But a decade later, missionaries opened a school in Neiafu, Tonga’s second-largest town, and began preaching across the islands. Dozens of other schools were started by missionaries and seven remain open. The church's membership in Tonga has grown to 68,000 and 175 congregations.\n\n“Since the 19th century, the church has had a really, really prominent place in Tongan society. Depending on who you ask, somewhere between one-third and two-thirds of everybody who lives in Tonga are members of the LDS church,” said Matthew Bowman, a Claremont Graduate University professor specializing in U.S. religious history.\n\nToday, more than a quarter of the Tongan population in the U.S. resides in Utah, where the church is headquartered. The state's Tongan population is about 23,000 and is mostly concentrated in Salt Lake County, according to census data.\n\nOn Wednesday night, residents from a housing complex next to the church flooded outside to help victims and console dozens of people who had been attending a funeral for a man identified by family on social media as Asi Sekona. Several family members could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nBrennan McIntire said he and his wife, Kenna, heard several loud gunshots from their apartment next to the church parking lot while watching TV. He jumped off the couch and ran outside in flip-flops to see what happened.\n\n“As soon as I came over, I see someone on the ground,” he said. “People are attending to him and crying and arguing.”\n\nKenna McIntire came outside soon after and was rattled at the sight of first responders lifting an unconscious woman into an ambulance while people huddled around and sobbed.\n\nThe couple said they hear gunshots in their neighborhood almost daily, but never right outside their door.\n\n“It was really heartbreaking to hear and see,” Kenna McIntire said.\n\nAbout 100 law enforcement vehicles were at the scene in the aftermath, and helicopters flew overhead. Police said they were reviewing license plate readers and surveillance videos from nearby businesses in their search for suspects.\n\nThe church was cooperating with law enforcement and said it was grateful for first responders' quick efforts.\n\n“We extend prayers for all who have been impacted by this tragedy and express deep concern that any sacred space intended for worship should be subjected to violence of any kind,” church spokesperson Sam Penrod said.\n\nLatter-day Saints have been on heightened alert since four people were killed when a former Marine opened fire in one of their churches in Michigan in September and set it ablaze. The FBI found that he was motivated by “anti-religious beliefs” against the church.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of Vaea Tulikihihifo’s last name, which had previously been misspelled by Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd.\n\nBilleaud reported from Phoenix. Associated Press writer Luis Andres Henao contributed from Princeton, New Jersey.",

    "fullText": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has often been accused by critics of delivering North Korea–style propaganda on behalf of her boss, President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, some suggested she’d taken the comparison a step further by dressing the part too.\n\nSocial media users joked that Leavitt’s outfit for a White House press briefing bore a resemblance (in its color at the very least) to the signature look of North Korean state TV anchor Ri Chun-hee, whose bombastic broadcasts defending the so-called Hermit Kingdom’s dictator Kim Jong Un have for years gone viral online.\n\n“Leavitt was wearing Ri Chun-hee’s outfit today,” journalist Aaron Rupar joked on X, the Elon Musk-owned platform formerly known as Twitter, in a post that racked up more than 300,000 views.\n\nWriter Hemant Mehta echoed the sentiment, noting: “Probably doesn’t help that she’s wearing the North Korean news anchor colors while saying this.”\n\nOthers took the joke further, sharing altered images that appeared to place Leavitt, who announced last month that she is pregnant with her second child, directly into Ri’s on-air wardrobe and arguing that their messaging sounded strikingly similar too.\n\nTrump Admits Melania Hates These 2 Things He Does\n\nTrump’s Rambling House GOP Speech Gets The Most Brutal Edit From Kimmel\n\nTrump’s New Nickname For Himself Fails To Clean Up With Critics",

    "description": "TikTok told some US staff that they will work for a new global entity that is not a part of the new joint venture run by Oracle and others.",
    "fullText": "TikTok is preparing to carve off parts of its US business, but not all US workers are joining the new entity.\n\nSome US staff were told this week that they will not work for the new joint venture, called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, led by managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. Instead, they will work for a separate TikTok global entity that will remain under ByteDance's ownership, called TT Commerce & Global Services LLC.\n\nThe change, outlined in a memo sent to impacted employees, includes workers who focus on US products that will remain tied to TikTok's global operations after the sale closes. In December, TikTok's CEO Shou Chew told staff those business lines would include \"certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\"\n\nOther US workers, such as those focused on data protection or algorithm security, would work under the USDS Joint Venture entity, according to Chew's memo. He said the deal would close on January 22.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the staffing change.\n\nIf the proposed TikTok deal goes through, Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake would each own 15% of the new US joint venture. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors would get around 30%. Five percent would go to an unnamed group of new investors, and ByteDance would keep just under 20% of the business to comply with the ownership requirements of the US divestment law that sparked the sale.\n\nThe law, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requires companies based in countries the US has deemed a foreign adversary to divest from their US assets or face hefty fines.\n\nCongress called out TikTok and China-based ByteDance in the law's text. TikTok challenged the law in court but lost its case in a Supreme Court ruling last January.\n\nPresident Donald Trump allowed the app to continue to operate last year via a series of executive orders as his administration worked with TikTok and prospective buyers on a potential deal. In September, the White House announced a deal had been reached, which Vice President JD Vance said would value TikTok US at around $14 billion.",

    "description": "Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth calls key all-hands meeting at Reality Labs as the division faces budget cuts, strategic shifts to AI, and layoffs last year.",
    "fullText": "Meta's Chief Technology Officer and head of Reality Labs, Andrew Bosworth, has called an all-hands meeting for January 14, describing it as the \"most important\" of the year.\n\nBosworth is also strongly recommending that Reality Labs employees attend the division's meeting in person, two Meta employees told Business Insider.\n\nThe emphasis on in-person attendance is unusual for the division, which oversees the company's wearables, virtual and augmented reality initiatives, and a nascent robotics unit, these employees said. Some managers have told employees to \"drop what they're doing\" to attend the all-hands in person, one employee told Business Insider.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the meeting.\n\nWhile the division has seen some success, such as its Ray-Ban smart glasses, Reality Labs has been a costly venture for Meta, incurring losses of more than $70 billion since 2020.\n\nLast year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shifted the company's strategic focus toward AI and away from the metaverse. In 2025, Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, Alexandr Wang, as part of the major reset of the company's AI efforts. Meta then embarked on a multibillion-dollar hiring spree, poaching top-tier AI researchers and engineers from rivals such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n\nReality Labs has faced repeated rounds of cuts over the past year. In December, Business Insider reported that Meta was planning budget cuts up to 30% and considering job cuts in Reality Labs.\n\nLast April, Meta laid off employees in Oculus Studios, its in-house gaming division, and the team behind Supernatural, the VR fitness app Meta acquired for over $400 million. Those cuts followed Meta's broader January 2025 layoffs that eliminated nearly 4,000 roles companywide, with at least 560 affecting Reality Labs employees.\n\nIn a memo obtained by Business Insider earlier last year, Bosworth referred to 2025 as \"the most critical\" year in his eight-year tenure at Reality Labs.\n\n\"This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,\" he wrote.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The Treasury Secretary said that Trump's proposal to keep big players from buying single-family homes would not force them to sell current holdings.",
    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that President Donald Trump's proposal to keep Wall Street players from buying single-family homes would not force them to sell their current holdings.\n\n\"These big institutions buy housing, then rent them out, and they're able to depreciate it. They hide their earnings, pay lower taxes,\" he said on Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota.\n\n\"The idea here is bygones are bygones,\" Bessent added. \"We're not going to have a forced sale here.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he would ban institutional investors from purchasing single-family homes in an effort to make housing more affordable for Americans. Single-family homes refer to standalone residential buildings with their own entrance designed for one household.\n\n\"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,\" Trump wrote on a Truth Social post. \"That American dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.\"\n\nShares of asset manager Blackstone fell 5.6% on Wednesday after Trump's post. Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, oversees one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the US, with several hundred thousand single-family homes and apartments. Other stocks similarly fell.\n\nCritics say firms like New York-based Blackstone put pressure on the housing market, reducing the availability of homes and driving prices up. Blackstone closed 1.1% higher at the end of the trading day on Thursday.\n\nThe institutional players, meanwhile, say lack of housing supply — not big-business ownership — is pushing prices up.\n\nIn Minnesota on Thursday, Bessent said that the administration has not decided on the \"exact contours\" of this new proposal.\n\n\"We want to keep the traditional mom and pop owners in. We want to keep families who rent out to their other family members,\" he said.\n\nBessent said that this practice of large firms buying up single-family homes started during the 2008 financial crisis, when private equity companies were among the few parties with the money to buy these homes.\n\n\"They hoovered up the single-family housing stock,\" he said.\n\nThe US Government Accountability Office found that in 2022, the five largest institutional investors owned nearly 2% of single-family rental homes.",

    "description": "GM said it would record about $6 billion in fourth-quarter charges tied to scaling back EV plans in the US.",
    "fullText": "General Motors has warned investors that its electric-vehicle strategy is proving costly — and that the pain is not yet over.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that it will record about $6 billion in fourth-quarter charges tied to scaling back EV plans in the US, with another $1.1 billion linked to restructuring in China.\n\nMost of the EV-related hits stem from contract cancellations, supplier settlements, and asset writedowns, GM said, as demand for battery-powered cars sputters.\n\nGM said the charge will be recorded as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings. It warned that additional EV-related costs are likely in 2026 as it continues negotiations with suppliers, though it expects those charges to be lower than last year's.\n\nThe automaker also said the writedown would not affect its roughly dozen electric models sold in the US.\n\n\"We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,\" it said in its filing.\n\nGM's announcement on Thursday follows a $1.6 billion writedown in the third quarter, which the automaker took as it began pivoting away from its EV strategy after an overhaul of US regulations under the Trump administration.\n\nTrump has reversed major EV-friendly measures from the Biden era, including the $7,500 federal EV tax credit that had underpinned consumer demand for electric vehicles.\n\nGM said in a sales release on Monday that its EV sales fell 43% in the fourth quarter after the consumer tax credit expired. The automaker has since rolled back its EV plans and returned to hybrids and gas-powered cars. This was a marked change from the EV ambitions laid out in 2021, when its CEO, Mary Barra, said the company aimed to become electric-only by 2035.\n\nGM's profit warning comes weeks after Ford said in December that it would scale back its EV production, a move expected to cost it nearly $20 billion.\n\n​​\"Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,\" the company said in a news release.\n\nOther carmakers have also announced changes to their EV plans in recent months. Honda, Jeep, and Ram have dropped current or planned EV models for the US market, while Porsche said in September it would take a €1.8 billion, or $2.2 billion, hit as it shifts back toward hybrids and gas vehicles.",

    "fullText": "We might think that everything that is to be discovered from our historical past has been discovered by hard working archeologists, but surprisingly that is not the case. Archaeologists are still making discoveries consistently, and even sometimes accidentally.\n\nRecently, researchers working in Lichtenau, a medieval town in North Rhine-Westphalia, a state in Germany, stumbled on a sizable underground vault while conducting routine excavations in the old town center. The structure, spanning more than 1,000 square feet, was situated near what was once a medieval castle in Lichtenau.\n\nPreliminary assessments suggest that the vaulted cellar could date to the town’s early development, which began in 1321, though the exact age and original purpose of the structure remain under investigation. Despite its significance, many questions linger: Who built it? What was it used for? And how did it survive, intact, beneath centuries of urban life?\n\nOfficials from the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association have emphasized that this kind of find (relatively large, well-preserved, and historically situated) offers a rare window into urban life and architectural practices from the town’s formative era. The discovery also highlights just how much remains buried beneath modern developments, especially in historic European towns.\n\nWhile experts have yet to date the Lichtenau structure precisely, its size and craftsmanship are intriguing. Vaulted cellars of this scale could have served a range of functions in a medieval town, such as:\n\nStorage for food, wine, or goods, especially in commercial hubs\n\nWorkspaces or artisan workshops where durable underground spaces offered stable temperatures\n\nFoundations for former buildings, whose upper levels no longer survive above ground\n\nBecause it lies near a known medieval castle site, researchers hope this discovery could reveal more about how Lichtenau was planned and how its economy and daily life operated in the early phases of its history.\n\nArchaeological surprises like this one reshape historical narratives. Discoveries found by accident often fill gaps that planned digs might miss, whether due to budget limits, modern construction, or shifting research priorities.\n\nAnd this isn’t an isolated phenomenon. Around the world, including in Germany itself, significant artifacts and structures have been uncovered by chance:\n\nA family on a casual walk uncovered a 3,500-year-old Bronze Age dagger sitting right on the surface after a rainstorm, a find that offers insights into prehistoric metallurgy and ritual practices.\n\nArchaeologists in Delbrück-Bentfeld uncovered multiple early Roman settlements and artifacts, shedding light on early community layouts in North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nIn eastern Germany, workers repairing infrastructure once unearthed Mesolithic burials, providing rare glimpses into the lives and deaths of Stone Age communities.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, unexpected discoveries, from buried WWII bunkers in Germany and Poland to hidden medieval tunnels in Belgium, continue to emerge during seemingly ordinary construction or restoration work.\n\nThese finds remind us that history isn’t just in museums; it literally surrounds us from beneath roads, under parks, and below everyday buildings. Each accidental discovery is a piece of the puzzle that helps archaeologists reconstruct human life over millennia.\n\nThe Lichtenau find highlights a broader lesson for communities worldwide: preserving historical context can pay great dividends. Investments in archaeological surveys before major construction projects can:\n\nPrevent damage to irreplaceable heritage\n\nUncover unknown chapters of local history\n\nFuel cultural tourism and community pride\n\nInspire new research directions\n\nFor citizens and casual observers, it’s a reminder that what looks like ordinary ground might be the roof over a forgotten room, workshop, or even entire neighborhood from ages past.\n\nWhat was once invisible beneath centuries of streets and rooftops is now a topic of conversation among scholars and history lovers alike. The discovery in Lichtenau underscores how history is always waiting to be revealed and is sometimes just beneath a cobblestone street or a patch of grass. And while researchers work to decipher the mystery of this underground space, we’re reminded that chance still plays a vital role in uncovering the stories of our collective past.",

    "fullText": "“Pod Save America” host Jon Favreau ripped Vice President JD Vance on X Thursday morning over the latter’s politically charged reaction to an ICE agent’s fatal Wednesday shooting of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump officials have en masse accused the woman in question of committing domestic terrorism by trying to run over the ICE agent who shot her to death. Others, including multiple Minnesota state officials and many who have seen video of the incident online, have called for the ICE agent to be held accountable for his use of force and for resorting to violent measures.\n\nVance, for his part, used a video of the woman’s car making contact with the ICE agent’s body as an opportunity to make a statement directed at Democrats.\n\n“Every congressional democrat and every democrat who’s running for president should be asked a simple question: Do you think this officer was wrong in defending his life against a deranged leftist who tried to run him over?” the vice president wrote on X. “These people are going to try to arrest our law enforcement for doing their jobs. The least the media could do is ask them about it.”\n\nFavreau quickly called out Vance’s use of “deranged leftist” to describe the victim, identified as U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good. “What the f—k is wrong with you?” the former speechwriter asked in a quote-tweet response to Vance’s original post.\n\n“You have no idea who this woman was. You have no idea what she believed,” he continued. “You have no idea what an actual investigation might show. A 37-year-old American citizen was killed. Her 6-year-old son has been orphaned. Her family and friends are going through the worst moment of their lives. And all you can do is call her a ‘deranged leftist’? Seriously what the f—k is wrong with you?”\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? \n\nYou have no idea who this woman was. You have no idea what she believed.

Her family and friends are going… https://t.co/QSuIv6KR4O\n\n— Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) January 8, 2026\n\nIn a press conference conducted shortly after the Wednesday incident, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told ICE agents to “get the f—k out” of the city. “We do not want you here,” he said. “Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety and you are doing exactly the opposite.”\n\n“They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,” Frey added. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”\n\nThe post Podcaster Jon Favreau Rips JD Vance Over Minneapolis ICE Shooting: ‘What the F—k Is Wrong With You?’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "The federal agent who shot and killed a driver in Minneapolis is an Iraq War veteran who has served for nearly two decades in the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nJonathan Ross, who shot and killed Renee Good on Wednesday, has served as a deportation officer with ICE since 2015, records show. He was seriously injured last summer when he was dragged by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect whom he shot with a stun gun.\n\nFederal officials have not named the officer who shot Good, a 37-year-old mother who was shot as she tried to drive away from federal agents. But Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent who shot Good had been dragged by a vehicle last June, and a department spokesperson confirmed Noem was referring to the Bloomington, Minnesota, case in which documents identified the injured officer as Ross.\n\nNoem and other Trump administration officials have defended the agent as an experienced law enforcement professional who followed his training and shot Good after he believed she was trying to run him or other agents over with her vehicle. Video has raised questions about whether the shooting was in self-defense, and the FBI is investigating the deadly use of force. Some protesters are demanding that Ross face criminal charges, and Minnesota authorities also want to investigate.\n\nAttempts to reach Ross, 43, at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not immediately successful.\n\nHere are some things to know about him:\n\nExperienced military and law enforcement officer\n\nIn courtroom testimony last month, Ross said he deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard. Ross said he served as a machine gunner on a gun truck as part of a combat patrol team.\n\nHe said he returned from Iraq in 2005, went to college and joined the Border Patrol in 2007 near El Paso, Texas. He worked there until 2015, serving as a field intelligence agent gathering and analyzing information on cartels and drug and human smuggling.\n\nRoss said he has served as a deportation officer based in Minnesota since he joined ICE in 2015. He is assigned to fugitive operations, seeking to arrest “higher value targets” in the ICE region that includes Minneapolis, he testified last month. He said that he was also a team leader with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\n“So I develop the targets, create a target package, surveillance, and then develop a plan to execute the arrest warrant,” he said.\n\nRoss said that he was also a firearms instructor, an active shooter instructor, a field intelligence officer and member of the SWAT team. He said that he attended the Border Patrol’s academy in New Mexico, where he learned to speak Spanish.\n\nRoss was a leader of a team of agents who went to arrest a man who was in the U.S. illegally in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington on June 17. Agents had gathered outside the home of the man, Roberto Munoz-Guatemala, who left in his car, according to court records.\n\nFBI agents activated emergency sirens and lights instructing him to pull over but he did not. Ross pulled his vehicle diagonally in front of Munoz-Guatemala to force him to stop.\n\nRoss and an FBI agent identified themselves as police and pointed guns at Munoz-Guatemala, who raised his hands. Ross then approached Munoz-Guatemala’s vehicle and ordered him to put it in park.\n\nRoss told the driver to lower his window all the way down and warned that he would break it if he did not. Ross used a device known as a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the rear driver’s side window and reached inside the car to unlock the driver’s door.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela drove off while Ross’ arm was caught in the vehicle and accelerated, dragging Ross down the street. Ross fired his Taser, striking Munoz-Guatemala with prongs in the head, face and shoulder.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was not incapacitated by the Taser, prosecutors said, and kept driving, taking Ross the length of a football field in 12 seconds. Ross was knocked free from the vehicle by force after Munoz-Guatemala drove onto a curb for a second time and back to the street.\n\nRoss’ right arm was bleeding, and an FBI agent applied a tourniquet. Eventually, he received dozens of stitches at a hospital. Prosecutors said he had “suffered multiple large cuts, and abrasions to his knee, elbow, and face.”\n\n“It was pretty excruciating pain,” Ross testified.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was bleeding from his injuries and had a woman call 911, saying that he was assaulted and didn’t know whether the person trying to stop him was an officer. He was arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\nA jury found Munoz-Guatemala guilty at a trial last month, finding he “should reasonably have known that Jonathan Ross was a law enforcement officer and not a private citizen attempting to assault him.”\n\nFederal officials defend the agent without identifying him\n\nVice President J.D. Vance praised the agent's service to the country Thursday without naming him, saying the ICE officer “deserves a debt of gratitude.”\n\n“This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America,” Vance said. “He’s been assaulted. He’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it.”\n\nDHS assistant Tricia McLaughlin declined to confirm the agent's identity Thursday, saying doing so would be dangerous for the safety of him and his family. But she noted that he had been selected for ICE’s special response team, which includes a 30-hour tryout and additional training on specialized skills such as breaching techniques, perimeter control, hostage rescue and firearms.\n\n“He acted according to his training,” she said. “This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.”",

    "title": "Google billionaire Larry Page copies the Jeff Bezos playbook, buying a $173 million Miami compound that will save him millions in taxes",
    "description": "Critics warned a wealth tax in California would lead to a billionaire exodus. Florida says come on in, the water's warm.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page has quietly—or loudly—joined the billionaire exodus from California, shifting businesses east and dropping about $173 million on two ultra-luxury waterfront mansions in Miami’s Coconut Grove in a move that looks strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos’ relocation playbook. The timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look downright Bezos-ian.​\n\nIn late December and early January, The Wall Street Journal reported, Page snapped up two neighboring estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove, paying roughly $101.5 million for one waterfront compound and $71.9 million for another in an off‑market deal, for a combined outlay of about $173.4 million. One of the homes, previously listed for $135 million, spans 13 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms and sits directly on the water, while the second, bought from heiress Sloan Lindemann Barnett and her husband Roger Barnett, nearly doubled in value in less than five years.​\n\nThe purchases plant Page squarely inside one of Miami’s most exclusive enclaves, long favored by global elites seeking privacy, water access, and low‑key luxury. Local brokers say his splashy entry is part of a broader surge of high‑net‑worth Californians scouting Coconut Grove and other South Florida neighborhoods as they hedge against looming tax changes while upgrading to trophy waterfront properties. The real-estate purchases double as both a luxury retreat and a massive tax‑savings vehicle, with Page the most prominent of California’s ultrawealthy choosing to leave as state lawmakers are targeting fortunes like his with an aggressive wealth‑tax push.\n\nBehind the real-estate headlines, Page has been methodically severing his financial and legal ties to California ahead of a proposed wealth tax that targets residents worth more than $1 billion. Regulatory filings show he has moved his family office and several investment and holding entities out of the state, Business Insider reported, reincorporating key vehicles in Delaware and listing new business addresses in Florida.​\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Page had been telling associates he was considering Florida specifically because of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a 5% annual levy on the worldwide assets of billionaires domiciled in California. If passed and applied retroactively to residents as of Jan. 1, 2026, analysts estimate the tax could cost Page—currently ranked as the world’s second‑richest person—well over $10 billion.\n\n​​Some Silicon Valley executives, notably Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, warned such an outcome was possible, saying in late December founders would have to sell off parts of their companies to pay for “fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.” California Rep. Ro Khanna responded to the Times‘ reporting that Page and Peter Thiel were looking to leave by flagging the story on X and saying, seemingly sarcastically in the style of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “I will miss them very much.”",

    "fullText": "Archaeologists working on the coast of Israel have uncovered a large port city which contains what experts say is the “most compelling physical proof yet” supporting the Bible, reported GB News.\n\nThe remarkable discovery was made in the former city of Caesarea Maritima, now an immense archaeological park which rests about 30 miles outside of present-day Tel Aviv. The city, constructed between 22 B.C. and 10 B.C. by King Herod, housed a massive harbor as well as aqueducts, a theater, and a public stadium, all of which remain today. Caesarea Maritima is mentioned several times in the Book of Acts, which paints the port city as a major hub of influence for early Roman politics and Christianity. Based upon the evidence found, it’s believed that early Christians lived and worshipped in Caesarea Maritima, which lines up with accounts in the New Testament.\n\nCaesarea Maritima is also named in the Bible as the location where the first non-Jewish believer in Christianity was baptized by the apostle Peter, an event which marked the spread of Christian belief beyond the Judaic community. It is also the city in which Paul the apostle was imprisoned and later tried before Roman officials, an event likewise described in the Book of Acts. After the city was abandoned in 1265, it lay untouched until archaeological excavations began in the 1950s.\n\nFound throughout the ancient city were detailed mosaics which quote Paul’s letters, including several inscriptions which are believed to be amongst the oldest in the New Testament. One of the mosaics features a quote from Romans 13:3 which reads: \"Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.\"\n\nThe site is also home to the fabled Pilates Stone, which was discovered during an excavation in 1961 and still bears an inscription announcing Pontius Pilate as the Roman governor of Judea. This discovery was the first concrete archaeological proof that Pontius Pilate, who in the Bible oversaw Jesus’ trial and execution, was a real historical figure. The partially visible inscription reads: \"To this Divine Augusti Tiberieum, Pontius Pilate, prefect of Judea, has dedicated this.\" It dates back to somewhere between 26 A.D. and 36 A.D., which directly aligns with the timeline described in the Bible. The original stone now rests iat the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, while a replica now occupies the space in Caesarea Maritima.\n\nArchaeologists also unearthed several never-before-found ancient structures, including a governor’s residence and a residence for other high-ranking government and military officials, known as a praetorium. The remarkable discoveries will soon be opened to the public as part of the vast expeditions at the Caesarea Maritima Archaeological Park.",

    "fullText": "Pablo Manríquez on X/MeidasTouch\n\nRep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI) shredded “idiot” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday for immediately accusing Renee Nicole Good of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nGood was killed on Thursday in Minneapolis by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross, who shot Good in the face as she attempted to drive away from another agent who had his hand on her door handle after he told her to get out of her SUV. Good was pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting was caught on video and posted on social media.\n\nShortly after the killing, Noem quickly blamed Good for her own death and accused her of engaging in terrorism against Ross and the other agents. Noem claimed that Good had attempted to “ram them with her vehicle.”\n\nA photo taken of Good’s vehicle after the shooting shows a bloodied airbag and stuffed animals for her six-year-old, whom she dropped off at school just before she was killed, in the glove compartment.\n\nPablo Manríquez of Migrant Insider caught up with Magaziner outside the Capitol on Thursday and asked for the lawmaker’s reaction to Noem’s comments. The exchange was posted by Acyn Torabi of MeidasTouch.\n\n.@PabloReports: What do you make of Kristi Noem calling Renee Good a domestic terrorist?\n\nMagaziner: Kristi Noem is an idiot. pic.twitter.com/qhEh6tUNYT\n\n“What do you make of Kristi Noem calling Renee Good a domestic terrorist?” Manríquez asked.\n\nKristi Noem’s an idiot, right? Like, she went on TV before any of the facts were in. She made up this story on TV about ICE agents trying to dig their truck out of the snow or something, which was clearly false. Like she didn’t even realize that there was gonna be video of what happened when she went up and gave a false story.\n\nEverybody in the Trump administration lies, but she’s not even good at the lie, right? And we’ve seen that over and over again. So, you know, it would be ridiculous, it would be funny if it wasn’t so sad and tragic because actual people’s lives are being ruined and in some cases ended by the lawlessness of the administration. And, again, like, if they had just done what they said they would do and just focus on people with serious criminal records, no one would be complaining, but they can’t help themselves.\n\nAfter the shooting, President Donald Trump blamed Good for the shooting, calling her a “professional agitator.” Vice President JD Vance alleged she was a “deranged leftist.”\n\nThe post ‘Kristi Noem’s an Idiot’: Congressman Shreds DHS Secretary Who ‘Didn’t Even Realize That There Was Gonna Be Video’ of ICE Killing first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": ", \n Peter Brown\n , and \n Aron Garst\n on January 8, 2026 at 4:57PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nCall of Duty is a cultural touchpoint in gaming. It has held the title of most popular first-person shooter for years, in a genre filled with high-quality multiplayer games that have constantly gunned for the top spot. While major elements persist across titles, each game tends to introduce--or at least attempt to introduce--something new to the formula, as Activision bounces development duties between internal studios including Treyarch and Infinity Ward.\n\nThe series goes back to 2003 with the original Call of Duty fighting with Medal of Honor and Battlefield--two franchises that already had established reputations--for player attention. All three were set during World War II, and Call of Duty would continue down that path for both Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 3.\n\nAfter several games set in the most devastating international conflict the world has ever seen, the series went in a different direction with the release of the widely-acclaimed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. A gripping narrative, memorable characters, and fast-paced multiplayer gave fans a rush of adrenaline and the series reached a height it had never achieved before. The positive reception ensured a steady stream of modern- or future-set sequels, including multiple Call of Duty: Black-Ops and two more Modern Warfare (Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3) games in the years to come.\n\nCall of Duty moves in cycles, and it was in 2017 that Activision took the series back to World War II for Call of Duty: WWII. It was a return to form that seemed like the right move at the right time--a good way to shake up the flow of the previous 10 years. Following Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 in 2018--which abandoned a single-player campaign but introduced a series-first battle royale mode--the franchise rebooted the Modern Warfare series in 2019.\n\nActivision took potentially the biggest step forward for the franchise to date by launching a free-to-play battle royale standalone game called Warzone in 2020. That has gone on to become a massive success for the publisher, eclipsing the standard game by several metrics. The main series continued with annual releases, with Black Ops Cold War coming out alongside Warzone in 2020. We saw both parts of Activision's Call of Duty ecosystem intertwine, with Black Ops guns coming into Warzone and a map redesign themed around Cold War's 1980s setting.\n\nCall of Duty's reach is vast, and it has resonated with casual and hardcore players for a wide variety of reasons. We've collected GameSpot's Call of Duty reviews from over the years and compiled them here to illustrate the series' rise to prominence, and to provide a historical snapshot of each individual games' place in the process. But if there's a particular game that made you fall in (or out) of love with Call of Duty, shout it out in the comments below!\n\n\"Call of Duty is an all-around excellent game that confidently challenges, head-on, all the other WWII-themed shooters out there and comes out on top. When a game is outstanding, like this one is, some people invariably expect it to be something completely different from what's already available. That's not true of Call of Duty, which is directly comparable to Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and other such games. Yet, on its own merits, this game is executed extraordinarily well, and, therefore, can be wholeheartedly recommended not just to fans of other WWII-themed shooters but to anyone looking for a first-rate action game.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Overall, Call of Duty: Finest Hour is still a competent shooter, and those who enjoy World War II-based games will still have a good time with it. Had the feel of the weapons been a little better, and had the campaign been more consistently intense, Finest Hour could have been a much better game. As it is, though, it enters a market that becomes more and more competitive with each passing month. Judged against the standards of so many other quality first-person shooters, Finest Hour is difficult to wholeheartedly recommend.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Call of Duty 2 is just about everything you would hope for and expect from the sequel to one of the most successful World War II shooters of all time. Its varied campaign, excellent sound and gameplay design, and generally good AI make it a worthy successor to the original. At the same time, though, it's still a World War II shooter, and if you've grown weary of them, then Call of Duty 2's lack of new material might turn you away. It can also be murderous on your computer if you have modest hardware. What Call of Duty 2 does do well is nail down just about all aspects that define an ideal first-person shooter. If you liked the original and have been thirsting for more, Call of Duty 2 will definitely deliver that.\" [Read the review]\n\nOverall, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One is still a worthwhile first-person shooter. The game has made noticeable strides over the previous Call of Duty game on consoles with an interesting, but short, campaign. While the game has its moments, particularly with the turret shooting and vehicle portions, Big Red One still falls short of the standard the series set for itself on the PC because of pedestrian sound effects, poor AI, and a lack of intensity in the infantry combat. The multiplayer action on the Xbox and PS2 is also only serviceable, so it's worth a bullet point on the back of the box...and not much more. Unless you're a hardcore WWII game fanatic, Big Red One's probably only worth a rent.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"From start to finish, Call of Duty 3 is an intense experience and a great game. The visuals are fantastic and the sound is some of the best in any game to date. Though there's no question that Call of Duty 3 is every bit as good as its predecessor, and without question the multiplayer is vastly improved, none of the changes or additions to the single-player campaign significantly alter the way the game plays. If the Call of Duty series hasn't won you over previously, Call of Duty 3 isn't going to do much to change your mind. But for anyone else, Call of Duty 3 is a must-own.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Call of Duty: Roads to Victory isn't a terrible game--it's just unnecessary. While it may look like Call of Duty and for a while feel like Call of Duty, nearly all of the things that make the Call of Duty games so enjoyable are watered down or missing.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"COD 4 is available on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, and each version holds up admirably. The differences between the two console versions feel mostly negligible. Both systems deliver good frame rates and have good, easy-to-use multiplayer setups that most closely resemble Halo 2 and 3's party system and matchmaking playlists. The PC version of the game uses a more traditional server browser to get you into games. Both systems work just fine on their respective platforms. The PC version has the ability to run in a higher resolution, if you're equipped with a PC that can handle it, but it seems to scale quite well. You can also create servers that allow up to 32 players to play at once on the PC, as opposed to a limit of 18 in the console versions, but given the size of the multiplayer maps, putting 32 players in them makes things a little too crowded. Despite listing 1080p support on the back of the box, COD 4 appears to prefer 720p on the PlayStation 3. The only way to get it to run in 1080p is to tell your PS3 that your TV doesn't support 720p or 1080i, but the difference seems minor. Either way, you'd be hard-pressed to tell it apart from its Xbox 360 counterpart. And all versions control just fine, making the decision over which version to buy totally dependent on which controller you like the most.\n\nIt's a shame that the single-player is so brief, but you should only skip out on Call of Duty 4 if you're the sort of person who doesn't appreciate great first-person shooter multiplayer. The quality of the content in the campaign is totally top-shelf, and the multiplayer is some of the best around, making this a truly superb package.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"The bigger issue is the lack of any sort of online play. It'll take you roughly eight hours to finish the campaign, which you'll probably spread out over two or three play sessions just to give your eyes and hands ample rest. Beyond that, the multiplayer mode is restricted to four players who happen to be in the same room as you. There's a decent selection of environments while the layouts are well suited to the different deathmatch and capture-the-flag options, but realistically speaking, how likely are you to convince four of your friends to buy one DS game then arrange for everyone to get together to take advantage of its multiplayer mode? Not very likely. As such, the game's longevity stems mainly from its single-player campaign. That's Call of Duty 4 on the DS in a nutshell: intensely satisfying, but over in a day or two.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"By staying largely true to the formula that made Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare so successful, Call of Duty: World at War has ensured a proven level of technical quality, particularly in the multiplayer arena. On the other hand, one of Modern Warfare's strengths was its fresh approach, and by embracing a familiar setting and familiar mechanics, World at War achieves greatness but falls short of excellence. This is only a bad thing if you are expecting this game to top its benchmark predecessor. If, however, you are hoping for an exciting campaign, fun cooperative play, and engaging multiplayer action, then you'll find a lot to be happy about in World at War.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"All told, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Reflex Edition does right by the source material. The expertly scripted and intensely exciting campaign is just as entertaining as it was two years ago on other systems, and even the occasional lapses in visual fidelity and control precision can't keep it from being a must-play for Wii shooter fans. Though the multiplayer will feel familiar to World at War veterans, the modern guns, equipment, and perks will make it feel new again, and the expanded gameplay modes offer a lot more variety. Though there are a few hitches to deal with, the core excellence of this game shines through, giving Wii owners a great shooter to keep them entertained for months to come.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Fortunately, the action generally remains on the good side of hectic, and the stream of rewards is as satisfying as ever. Two new elements, title and emblem, are little graphics and titles that you earn through your match performance, and these range run the gamut from serious to totally goofy. While not exactly in keeping with the serious tone of the campaign, they add an amusing way to further customize your online presence. With a robust variety of playlists in which to ply your deadly trade, Modern Warfare 2's competitive multiplayer is the best in the series and one of the best available on consoles. The inelegant campaign plot may make you feel like you're just along for the ride, but it is such an intense, roaringly great ride that you will be glad just to have played it. The cooperative missions provide a uniquely fun angle on the action that rounds out the package superbly, making Modern Warfare 2 thoroughly entertaining, thoroughly rewarding, and thoroughly worth the wait.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"While it may not take the signature Call of Duty action to dizzying new heights, Black Ops is a thoroughly excellent game. New modes and mechanics give a jolt of energy to the lively competitive multiplayer, and the engrossing new campaign develops into one of the best in the series. Combat training allows anyone to enjoy the thrills of arena combat and the satisfaction of leveling up, and the opportunities for cooperative play, local competition, and community video creation provide even more outlets for entertainment. Call of Duty: Black Ops lives up to the top-notch pedigree that the series has earned, giving players an awesome new shooter to enjoy just in time for the holidays.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Modern Warfare 3 doesn't take any chances with the tried-and-true formula. At launch, even the matchmaking playlists feature standard fare, but the robust Private Match customization options let you tweak the standards to your liking (even offering some of Black Ops' more interesting modes) and hold the possibility of odd permutations to come. Whatever diversions or innovations may lie in Modern Warfare 3's future, the competitive multiplayer still offers the same sweet satisfaction you've come to expect from the series. This is some of the best online shooter action around, and with the daunting challenges of Spec Ops and the exciting, globe-trotting campaign, Modern Warfare 3 stands tall as another great descendant of the game that changed a generation.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Though zombies mode is stagnating, the rest of Black Ops II is lively, and it's great to see some shifting in the familiar structure. Developer Treyarch's storytelling prowess has once again resulted in an engaging, exciting campaign, and the addition of league play to the online multiplayer arena is an intriguing change that could reinvigorate the formula that has endured for so long. By reaching forward while remaining rooted in the things it does so well, Black Ops II offers a great shooter experience.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Crashes occur on a fairly regular basis, locking the system up. It's tough to stay connected to games, and even remaining hooked up to Wi-Fi can be a challenge. Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified is a massive disappointment that tarnishes this highly regarded franchise. What's more, this is a blown opportunity for the Vita to garner itself a headline game and franchise that could have really energized the system. Instead, we get a quick, forgettable knockoff cranked out simply to take advantage of the buzz around the Black Ops name.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"From an exuberant campaign full of spectacle and variety to the way Extinction's unpredictable aliens force you to use those targeting skills in entirely new ways, Ghosts strikes an excellent balance between the familiar and the novel. This is a game that's keenly aware of the series' strengths, but doesn't find itself beholden to them. No matter what standard you apply, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a terrific first-person shooter.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"The last time Call of Duty had “Warfare” in its subtitle, it led to a well-received trilogy that deftly transitioned the series away from a well-trodden global conflict to modern-day combat. If the settings of today have run their course just as World War II did years ago, Advanced Warfare makes for a convincing foundation of futuristic yet relatable combat that is worth exploring and expanding further. The huge change in player mobility is less of a paradigm shift and more of an overdue retooling for an 11-year-old FPS franchise, especially in a year of mobility-focused shooters. Yet for all its predictability, Advanced Warfare is a deluge of action-film bravado, and it's difficult to not be carried away by its tidal forces.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"There are fleeting moments when Black Ops III's cybernetic modifications change the way you play. These abilities let you control enemy drones, stun human opponents, or set fire to robots' internal systems. The powers would be more impactful, though, if there wasn't such a lack of enemy variety. Aside from flying drones and the occasional mech mini-boss, enemy variants just require differing numbers of bullets to take down. And when you're using them on such a repetitive group of targets, who react the same way every time, the abilities lose their novelty.\n\nAlthough Black Ops III offers the option to play the campaign cooperatively, its problems only multiply as a result. Instead of creating deeper scenarios involving teamwork and communication between up to four players, Black Ops III decides to just throw more hardened enemies at you. One Warlord--an enemy that requires several magazines to bring down--is bothersome enough. Four of them together is downright frustrating. They feel more like brick walls than sentient soldiers.\n\nBlack Ops III's narrative doesn't support the campaign in any meaningful way, either. It tells an incomprehensible story about AI ascendancy and the moral grays of a hyper-connected future, raising intriguing questions but never bothering to answer them. At the end of it all, after hours of soulless shooting and unremarkable storytelling, Black Ops III delivered its nebulous twist, and I didn't dwell on it.\n\nIn its undead modes, and the first 10 hours of multiplayer, it excels. But in its campaign, it merely crawls forward. Black Ops III doesn't offer anything remarkable to the series, but does just enough to maintain the Call of Duty status quo. The franchise, however slowly, continues its inexorable march.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"By venturing beyond Earth--and not just to other planets, but to space itself--Call of Duty found a canvas to produce its best story in years. It reinforces the notion that a game's narrative is only as good as its characters. Given the campaign's accomplishments in space combat, it's puzzling that no effort was made to replicate its zero-G sensations in Infinite Warfare's multiplayer. Consequently, the well-crafted Zombies mode is a more attractive, time-consuming proposition for those looking to play with friends. While no Call of Duty game has matched the comprehensive excellence of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the exploits of Reyes and Ethan are at least as memorable and moving as any deeds from “Soap” MacTavish and John Price during from the series' heyday.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Ultimately, if every shooter set in the European Theater of World War II is measured by how it depicts its D-Day landing--assuming it has such a mission--Call of Duty: WWII emphatically succeeds in its impactful designs and delivery. The sensation of riding the troop carrier as it approached the beach filled me with depression more than dread, knowing I'd survive eventually while many of my surrounding brothers in arms wouldn't. While not equally emotional, this battle's reinterpretation in War mode proves to be a highlight in a superb suite of competitive modes. Zombies rounds off this stellar return to form, effectively blending the ferocity of online cooperative play with the goal-driven satisfaction of found in the campaign. As one of the most comprehensive and filler-free Call of Dutys in recent memory, Call of Duty: WWII successfully capitalizes on the series' strengths\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Black Ops 4 isn't short on content, and its three main modes are substantial. Multiplayer introduces more tactical mechanics without forcing you into them, and it largely strikes a good balance. Zombies has multiple deep, secret-filled maps to explore, though its returning characters don't hold up and prove distracting. Finally, Blackout pushes Call of Duty in an entirely new direction, making use of aspects from both multiplayer and Zombies for a take on the battle royale genre that stands on its own. Sure, there isn't a traditional single-player campaign, but with the depth and breadth of what is there, Black Ops 4 doesn't need it.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Modern Warfare makes old observations and presents them with new flourishes. Those new flourishes do make for a good campaign and solid multiplayer. But it's when Modern Warfare asks you to think harder that it falls short. [Read the review]\n\n\"Warzone is a great sophomore attempt at a battle royale from Call of Duty, which finally manages to carve out its own identity with interesting spins on the existing formula. Its subversion of death and the nail-biting Gulag duels give you more ways to stay in a match, while also forcing you to be aware of your surroundings even after wiping a rival squad. Its looting is streamlined enough to make early moments feel fast, but Warzone also loses some of the messy magic from hobbled together loadouts by letting you drop in prebuilt ones far too easily and frequently. Still, if you're comfortable with Call of Duty's latest iteration of multiplayer antics and thrive in the stressful setting of battle royales, Warzone is a strong contender for your attention.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"As with any annual game franchise, it's hard not to compare Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War to last year's Modern Warfare. On the campaign side, Cold War does much better than last year's outing, showing that Call of Duty fares far better when it errs on the side of fantasy. This is true within Cold War's campaign, where the inclusion of Ronald Reagan is a bizarre fit for an otherwise larger-than-life story about espionage and brainwashing, and it's true when comparing its story to that of last year's self-serious Modern Warfare.\n\nIn Zombies, Cold War has a far more successful co-op mode than Modern Warfare's Spec Ops, though it's still in need of some balance tweaks. Multiplayer, however, is where Cold War struggles; it falls flat overall, and that's especially apparent in Warzone's shadow.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"The thing about Call of Duty games is that, with each yearly iteration, you pretty much know what you're getting--and that's largely the case here. It's both a blessing and a curse for Vanguard, however. Elements of Vanguard feel like good additions to the franchise, but its ideas also don't always mix well with the series' framework. That framework is still strong, and the solid gunplay, exciting multiplayer, and inventive moments of the campaign are worth seeking out. But forcing those two parts together exposes the seams in Call of Duty: Vanguard at times, weakening both parts of the game rather than pushing either one to the forefront.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Modern Warfare 2's gunplay and the fast time-to-kill all feel very much the same as Modern Warfare 2019. However, Infinity Ward definitely improved a lot on what worked and didn't work in the previous game. The scaled-back maps definitely make for better pacing, the less hectic movement is not so overwhelming, and all the new maneuverability features make the game so enjoyable from match to match. No one should load into a match expecting this game to be anything like the original Modern Warfare 2, but all issues aside, this rebooted version's gameplay does serve as a positive successor to Modern Warfare 2019.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Although its narrative setup is enjoyable, Modern Warfare 3 can't get out of its own way, with nearly half of the missions being the underwhelming Open Combat style. The bumpy pacing and abrupt ending make Makarov's big return a disappointment, dragging Modern Warfare 3 down as the weakest entry of an otherwise strong reboot series.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Between Omni-movement, map design, and new options for loadouts, Black Ops 6 is full of relatively small adjustments that fit well with the underlying Call of Duty formula, without drastically changing it. Those adjustments often do tend to favor one kind of play over others--the bunny hopping, dolphin diving, in-your-face aggressive approach--but that's not necessarily always a bad thing, and playing with Black Ops 6's new movement system makes for some phenomenal action moments and great-feeling gunfights. The effects of Omni-movement and smaller battlefields have a tendency to have a limiting effect on what works in Black Ops 6 multiplayer at times, but with well-built maps, quick traversal, intense weapons, and interesting loadout options and rewards, the things the game does well are still a whole lot of fun.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"One big change for Black Ops 7 is the reintroduction of classic matchmaking. This is the Call of Duty matchmaking formula present in the games that came before 2019's Modern Warfare reboot. This means open matchmaking with minimal skill consideration, whereas the recent games had strict skill-based matchmaking (or SBMM). This is something that a vocal portion of the community has been requesting to change in Call of Duty, but I don't think this is a positive for everyone. On one hand, I enjoy the classic matchmaking and the varied lobbies it provides. Some matches you get paired against really skilled opponents, and other times you're the better player. Call of Duty's strict SBMM of recent years made it difficult for players of various skill levels to play together. It also made some players feel punished for having a really good game, because the lobbies would seemingly increase in difficulty afterwards. On the other hand, I recognize there are players who might find the change jarring, if skill-based matchmaking was heavily protecting them. This is a big change for Call of Duty, and the impact of this remains to be seen.\n\n\"Overall, the multiplayer package is really strong in Black Ops 7. The movement is fun and fluid, the gunplay is as satisfying as ever, and the map designs greatly improve the experience from last year. Combined with the smaller quality-of-life change and the futuristic themes, Black Ops 7 feels like a fresh experience that avoids any dreaded fatigue.\" [Read the review]",

With a cast of four playable characters, each investigating a serial killer known as the Origami Killer, Heavy Rain's ambitious story can take many paths to multiple endings. The game's branching choices play out through slow-paced investigation scenes, interactions between characters, and intense action sequences navigated mostly through quick-time events--with potentially fatal outcomes for the characters if a key button press is missed. The game has multiple different endings for each character both bad and good, and the outcome of the central investigation also hinges on the player's actions. Initially released for the PS3, Heavy Rain has since been re-released for the PS4 (bundled with its successor Beyond: Two Souls) and also ported to PC.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fanatical.\n\nReleased in Telltale's heyday, The Walking Dead is easily one of the studio's best games. An episodic narrative game based on the comic book series of the same name, The Walking Dead sees players navigating the zombie apocalypse in the role of Lee Everett, a convicted criminal who finds himself looking after a young girl named Clementine. Unlike the majority of video games themed around zombies, The Walking Dead focuses more on the human element of its post-apocalyptic world, with interactions between characters often vital for survival. The game's action scenes are mostly handled through quick-time events in lieu of combat mechanics.\n\nA studio-defining title, Until Dawn was a breakout hit for Supermassive games, telling a trope-twisting teen horror story with many possible outcomes through its “butterfly effect” mechanic. The game follows eight teens on a trip to a mountain lodge, one year after two of their friends went missing on a similar trip. Each of the eight teens is playable at some point, and the choices the player makes for them--or their skill at hitting quick-time events--will determine who survives until dawn. The game feels like an homage to classic teen horror films, with its characters subjected to some good old-fashioned teen bullying alongside Until Dawn's terrifying supernatural threats. Until Dawn was so successful at nailing the feeling of a teen horror movie that it ended up being adapted into an actual film--which even took inspiration from the game’s branching narrative.\n\nAnother iconic game in the genre, Life Is Strange puts its own spin on the concept of the butterfly effect with a protagonist who has the ability to rewind time--allowing players to go back and choose different options almost instantly. Protagonist Max Caulfield has to come to grips with this mysterious new power, while also navigating the complexities high school life, and investigating a larger and darker mystery alongside childhood friend Chloe Price. The time-rewinding mechanic is used for puzzle-solving, and you'll also use exploration, item collecting, and branching dialogues with different characters to advance the story. Dontnod went on to make multiple games in the series, including a prequel Before the Storm and more recent direct sequel Double Exposure. Initially released as an episodic game, more recent re-releases have seen the Life is Strange collected and re-mastered.\n\nDon't let the RPG label put you off, Disco Elysium is far heavier on dialogue and player choices than it is on combat. Just like Detroit (and many other games in this list), Disco Elysium focuses on a detective who has been tasked with investigating a murder. The protagonist wakes up at the start of the game with amnesia, and it’s up to the player to then decide what kind of person he will be through a combination of dialogue choices and the game's unique skill tree. The isometric open-world game allows players to move through Elysium and interact with players and objects, with most other events resolved by skill checks based on dice rolls.\n\nAnother game from Detroit developer Quantic Dream, Beyond: Two Souls is critically polarizing, but still an interesting entry into a unique genre the studio pioneered. The game got a lot of attention for casting Hollywood stars in leading roles--Elliot Page played protagonist Jodie Holmes, and Willem Dafoe appeared as Jodie's father figure Nathan Dawkins. While most of its gameplay follows the classic Quantic Dream formula, Beyond shook things up through the addition of Aiden, an incorporeal soul linked to Jodie through a psychic tether. The player can choose to control Aiden instead of Jodie at times--or the game can be played in a multiplayer mode with a second player controlling Aiden. Unlike other Quantic Dream titles, Beyond: Two Souls only features one playable protagonist (not counting Aiden), and its narrative doesn’t branch quite as much, but players can still make a few major decisions, leading to various endings.\n\nThis gorgeous indie adventure game follows a group of teens who accidentally unleash a supernatural force on an overnight island trip. Players take control of protagonist Alex as she and her friends explore Edwards Island and try to unravel its mystery. The game's story is told entirely without cutscenes, with conversations happening as the characters walk through Oxenfree’s beautiful 2D environments. Alex can build and break relationships through these conversations, while using her handheld radio to solve puzzles and interact with the island's ghosts. Oxenfree has multiple possible outcomes for its teen characters, and several potential endings, as well as a new game plus mode that can further influence the story's outcome.\n\nA hard-boiled detective film in the form of a video game, L.A. Noire puts the player in the shoes of Detective Cole Phelps as he investigates crimes in 1947 Los Angeles. The game is split into various cases for the player to investigate, with an overarching conspiracy to be uncovered along the way. Each of the cases can be resolved with varying degrees of success depending on how much evidence the player manages to uncover. The game made big use of motion capture to animate the facial expressions of witnesses and suspects, allowing the player to pass judgement on who is lying and who is telling the truth. L.A. Noire is more action-oriented than others in the genre, involving combat with handguns and melee weapons, as well as action-packed chase scenes both on foot and in vehicles.\n\nThis reboot of the classic Sierra point-and-click adventure series was released episodically between 2015 and 2016, charting King Graham's rise to the throne and various adventures throughout his life. In King's Quest, players take control of Graham to explore different locations, solve puzzles, and investigate mysteries. Events both major and minor can be handled with three different approaches--bravery, wisdom, or compassion--with a player's choices throughout the game influencing what kind of person King Graham becomes. While the story is more linear than others in this list, the player still gets to make a handful of major choices that will influence how King's Quest plays out.\n\nA spiritual successor to Until Dawn, The Quarry is Supermassive's return to cliche teen horror, this time taking on the trope of a summer camp haunted by an unknown evil. The Quarry has nine playable characters, who can all live or die depending on the player's choices and skills throughout the game. Though its gameplay is mostly similar to Until Dawn, The Quarry features a multiplayer option where each character can be assigned to different player to control--potentially endangering or dooming their friends through their actions.\n\nIn Road 96, a group of teenagers attempt to flee the fictional authoritarian nation of Petria. The outcome of the story, and the fate of each of Road 96's playable characters, is affected by the decisions the player makes throughout the game. Each playthrough involves multiple characters--once one of the teens has either succeeded or failed to cross the border out of Petria, the player returns to the start of a different character's journey, with Road 96's finale taking place on Petria's tumultuous election day. The various encounters characters have along the road are procedurally generated, and there are multiple different ways to travel--catching buses, stealing cars, hitchhiking, hailing taxis, or simply walking. Like other games with branching narratives, Road 96 is designed to be played through multiple times, with each playthrough taking a different path to a different end.\n\nThe predecessor to Heavy Rain, this early Quantic Dream title was released as Fahrenheit outside the USA, where it was renamed Indigo Prophecy, and tells the story of a supernaturally possessed serial killer and the two detectives on his trail. Fahrenheit introduced concepts and features that would become fundamental to Quantic Dream's distinctive style of game, including the idea of a changing and evolving narrative based on character choices, and a focus on characters' journeys and mental states over combat or action elements. While Quantic Dreams' more recent games have definitely refined the formula, the original is still well worth a look.\n\nThis interactive narrative game was helmed by a developer who previously worked on Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls at Quantic Dream, and plenty of the studio's character-forward, narrative-heavy signature can be seen in As Dusk Falls. The game sees two very different families collide in the small desert town of Two Rock, Arizona following a car accident. Players guide multiple characters through a tense, ever-escalating confrontation between the families that spans two time periods. As Dusk Falls takes a democratic approach to multiplayer, allowing up to eight players to vote on what action should be taken next, with online, offline, and cross-platform multiplayer options available. Each player can also use a limited number of overrides, which will ensure that their option is picked.\n\nA niche third-person shooter from the creator of the Yakuza series, Binary Domain's story of a robot uprising and its interrogation of the personhood of humanoid androids covers very similar story beats to Detroit: Become Human. While its combat-heavy gameplay sets it apart from most of the games on this list, Binary Domain also features a unique \"consequence system\" that has the potential to change elements of the gameplay, story, and even the ending the player will experience. The consequence system tracks how the eight-person Rust Crew feels about player-character Dan Marshall, with the character interactions becoming just as important to Binary Domain as its combat. The game even has an android squadmate, exploring the sometimes uneasy relationship between man and machine.\n\nAnother title from Telltale's golden age, The Wolf Among Us was one of the narrative-focused studio's biggest hits. Based on the Fables comic series, The Wolf Among Us follows Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of Fabletown, as he investigates a series of strange murders. The gameplay involves investigating scenes and objects, talking to other characters in branching dialogue trees, and navigating action scenes through quick-time events. The game's dialogue choices run on a timer, forcing players to make quick decisions or let the timer run out and say nothing at all. The Wolf Among Us initially released in five episodes, but has since been collected into a single game and ported to a bunch of different platforms.\n\nJust like Detroit, Nobody Wants To Die sees the player take on the role of detective in a futuristic world, where technology can be used to analyse exactly what happened at the scene of a crime. The game is set in a world where human consciousness can be stored like data and switched between bodies, effectively extending the human lifespan indefinitely. The player character is James Karra, a detective on the trail of a serial killer who appears to be targeting the elites of the game’s futuristic vision of New York City. The branching narrative game features multiple endings based on the player's choices, with gameplay mostly consisting of investigating crime scenes and interrogating witnesses and other NPCs.\n\nOriginally conceived as a follow-up to Remedy's Alan Wake, Quantum Break instead ended up its own unique beast, featuring a time-manipulating protagonist and a future-sighted antagonist. One of the more action-oriented games on this list, protagonist Jack Joyce uses his time abilities to take on enemies in combat, but he can also use those abilities to investigate scenes and even replay past events. While many of the games on this list take inspiration from film and TV, Quantum Break takes that one step further by incorporating a live-action TV show into the game itself. Quantum Break is split up into five acts--at the end of each, the player is tasked with making a pivotal decision as antagonist Paul Serene, which is followed by an episode of the in-game TV show. Just like the game, the show has the potential to change based on the player's choices, with hidden scenes to unlock through multiple playthroughs.\n\nA new game from some of the developers behind the original Life is Strange, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is a two-part adventure game about a group of four girls during two different time periods--as teenagers in 1995, and reunited again 27 years later. Bloom & Rage is played entirely from the perspective of just one of the girls, Swann, who records events and subjects with her camcorder to be edited into her memoir. As adults, the group meets up to reminisce, at times struggling to remember what happened in the summer of 1995 that led them to part ways with no further contact. The events of the game will play out differently depending on what choices the characters make, and can even change depending on how much trust the player has managed to build with the other characters. Bloom & Rage is intended to be more than just a standalone game for Don't Nod, with more games being planned under the Lost Records label.\n\nWork as a superhero dispatcher in this workplace comedy-style game, where both your strategic choices and your relationships with your colleagues will impact how the narrative plays out. You play as Robert Robertson III, an employee of the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN) who is demoted from hero to dispatcher after his mecha suit is destroyed. Following in the footsteps of some of the classic narrative games of the 2010s, Dispatch is made up of eight episodes, initially released over a period of two months though they can now be played in full. Dispatch boasts an impressive voice cast including actors Aaron Paul and Jeffrey Wright, prominent gaming voice actors including Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey, influencers like Jacksepticeye and MoistCr1tikal, and even rapper Yung Gravy.\n\nSupermassive’s Dark Pictures Anthology is a series of narrative horror games--similar in tone and gameplay to its breakout hit Until Dawn, but smaller in scale. While the anthology’s games can be hit or miss, House Of Ashes is easily the strongest of the series so far and is worth a play for fans of Supermassive’s other games. Set during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the game features five playable characters--four of them members of the US Armed Forces, and one Iraqi Republican Guard. Finding themselves in a long-forgotten Akkadian temple beset by an ancient evil, the protagonists must put aside their allegiances to survive a deadlier supernatural threat. The third of a planned eight games in the Dark Pictures series, House of Ashes is the first in the anthology to start hinting at a bigger picture tying all of the ostensibly-unrelated games together.",

    "description": "Here's everything Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud said ahead of Monday's wild-card round matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
    "fullText": "Here's everything Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud said ahead of Monday's wild-card round matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers, including his thoughts on facing T.J. Watt and more.\n\nQuestion: On if the playoff experience he’s gained helps him as he prepares for this postseason\n\nC.J. Stroud: “I'm excited. The experience that I've been able to gain in the last two years has been very important and helpful. But this is a new year, and I never played on the road in a Wild Card game, so there’s a new experience in that. But I have a good idea of how some of these games go and that's… You don't have an idea. It can go any way, and this is a good team we're playing against. So, I’m trying to be prepared in my preparation as much as I can.”\n\nQ: On if he gets a little more excited when you’re playing in these games at this time of year\n\nStroud: “Yes and no. I think when the ball is snapped, you're just locked in. But I think the added extra cameras, extra eyes and stuff, you know, there's a little more eyes on you. I'm excited and I've played in some big games in my career and… Every next one is a bigger one. I just want to be able to handle this moment as best as I can and be present and enjoy it.”\n\nQ: On if playoff football is different or if it feels different\n\nStroud: “No, I wouldn't say it feels different. I think the margins are smaller. I think success is winning if you can win. I think that's the biggest thing is to find a way to win.”\n\nStroud: “Yeah, I have a lot of faith in Ka’imi. I think he's done a great job for us this year.”\n\nQ: On how the offensive line has performed this year\n\nStroud: “I think they're doing amazing. I think a lot of guys have been in there. I think schematically, too, me trying to get the ball out as fast as possible and taking one if one is there. I thought we've all grown from Tytus [Howard] all the way down to me. I think the leadership in that room has grown. I think Cole [Popovich] has done an amazing job. He's hard on those guys. He yells, he cusses, he does everything that you think an offensive line coach should do. Those guys, they're, ‘Yes, sir,’ and ‘No, sir.’ They also don't back down when a challenge is presented. They're the heartbeat of our team. We go as far as they go.”\n\nQ: On building chemistry with other pass catchers, outside of WR Nico Collins, throughout the season\n\nStroud: “Yeah, it's helpful. I think our young guys have gotten a lot of experience. There's still a lot of things they need to learn. They have to learn fast now. I'm excited for that. But I think every year I've had great receivers. Now we're just a little healthier, which is dope. So, I'm excited. I think this will be a great challenge for us. They're really good in the back end and do a great job in different coverages. We got to be able to identify what we're seeing and all be on the same page and go from there.”\n\nQ: On what he’s seen from the Pittsburgh Steelers pass rush\n\nStroud: “They [the Pittsburgh Steelers] rush together. They're going to push the pocket and burn the edge. I think they do a great job even with their effort. They’re getting chips and things like that the whole game and they're still going very hard. I have a lot of respect for [Alex] Highsmith and [T.J.] Watt and their interior guys. I think their whole defensive line is the heartbeat of their team. Then you've got Patrick Queen, who's a dog and been a great player in this league for a long time. Then Jalen [Ramsey], leading the guys in the back end. I think, overall, they've done a really good job. They make it hard and they play really hard. It's going to be a challenge. Up front, I respect them to a high standard and how Mike [Tomlin] coaches those guys as well.”\n\nQ: On how the game changes from the regular season to the playoffs\n\nStroud: “I wouldn't say it changes. The margin of the execution is just smaller. The guys are on a little more. I won’t change my preparation. I'll do the same things that I've always done. Maybe a little more here and a little less there. But whatever I need to do to be prepared. No special sauce, no special ingredient, still football. I just got to go and execute at a high level.”\n\nQ: On Offensive Coordinator Nick Caley and what stands out about him\n\nStroud: “I think his ability to block out the noise and continue to go forward. I think everybody in this day, and age wants a microwave. They want to throw something in the microwave, let it heat up fast and be a new product. That's none of us. Football is an oven type of sport or whatever you use, a Crock-Pot, whatever any of y'all use. I think this team, we try to do our best to block out the noise and stay in our brotherhood and lean on one another. I thought he's done a great job of leaning on us, asking us what we like, even if it didn't work, like not running away from asking guys what they like and putting guys in a position to do what we need to do best. We're still working. We still got a ways to go. But I'm just proud of that guy. I think he's done a heck of a job of calling it, of being honest and… One thing I respect about ‘Cales’ is he doesn't point fingers. If he does, it's in the right way. It's not like blame game. It's like, ‘Hey, you can be better here because I know you can.’ He's uplifting and I have a lot of love for that guy. He's done a heck of a job for us this year.”\n\nOn if his willingness to use his legs increases in playoff games\n\n“I don't know. I just try to play as fast as I can. I think every game I try to use my legs if I need to. But sometimes it doesn't present. I've been getting spied lately. So, that's kind of cool. I haven't gotten spied in my career probably in a long time. But whatever the play presents. Whatever way you've got to get the job done, get it done.”\n\nQ: On if there was any challenge of when to use his legs after the concussion\n\nStroud: “No, I don't live in fear, at least I try not to. I think this game, if you think about getting hurt, you think about something happening, is when it usually happens. I try my best to play fast and protect myself as well, though.”\n\nQ: On if he recalls watching Pittsburgh Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers play and what it means to face him in the playoffs\n\nStroud: “I'm a big fan of Aaron. I love what he does. He's been a heck of a player. I think he's a top-three quarterback to ever touch a football. He's done some really cool things in the sport. His mechanics are through the roof. His ability to use his pronation on his wrist and how he flicks the ball is just dope. I'm a big fan of his. This will be, I think, my second time facing him. I'm a big fan of his. I'm not going to be rooting for him on Monday night, but I think he's a heck of a player and I have a lot of respect for him. He's done it for a long time and is even doing it at a high level at his age now in year 21 or whatever it is for him. A lot of respect for him.”\n\nStroud: “Higgins has grown a lot. I think he's somebody who has killed people with extra movement and throwing his head and doing all these different releases and stuff. But I think I told him he's so big, fast and strong, the quicker you get open, the better. Especially for me, you're not really running around against defensive backs, you're running routes against the defensive line. I think it's somewhere he's grown in a lot of areas. I think he's grown in the run game, wanting to go block. I think all that stuff helps him. But he's done a tremendous job for us and he's going to be a heck of a player in this league for a long time.”\n\nQ: On his mindset going into the playoffs this year as opposed to the first two seasons\n\nQ: On how the team can take the adversity they faced in the regular season and carry it over to the playoffs\n\nStroud: “I think we have a lot of experience in high-pressure moments, high-pressure games. It'll be an opportunity for us to do it again. I think it's a heck of an opportunity to play in a legendary stadium against a legendary coach, a legendary team. This is going to be a great challenge. We've got to be ready. It's going to be cold and it's going to be loud and it's going to be a lot of elements that are not for us but are against us. But we've been in this before. We've played plenty of cold games, plenty of loud games, been in silent operations. A lot of experience in a lot of different ways. I think that will pay off when we go up there on Monday night.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: What did Texans QB C.J. Stroud say before wild-card game vs. Steelers?",

    "description": "The Canadian Women’s National Team superstar goalkeeper will now head to NC Courage after her recent time with San Diego Wave.",
    "fullText": "Today, the North Carolina Courage announced that they have signed CANWNT goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan to a two-year, fully-guaranteed contract through the 2027 season.\n\n“I can’t wait to join the Courage and bring my family to North Carolina. This team’s soccer identity and tactical systems are so exciting and fit the way I like to play as well. I’m really looking forward to joining the team, getting to work on the field, and focusing on a great season this year,” said Sheridan.\n\nWidely considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world, Sheridan has consistently found herself with numerous accolades and awards. She was named to NWSL Best XI First Team in 2021 and 2022, and Second Team in 2023. The GK also took home Goalkeeper of the Year honors in 2022.\n\nIn nine seasons, she earned 42 clean sheets in 166 regular season appearances. With the San Diego Wave, she help guide them to the 2023 NWSL Shield and 2024 NWSL Challenge Cup.\n\n“We’re delighted to welcome Kailen Sheridan to the club. She is an elite goalkeeper with proven experience at the highest level, and her leadership, distribution and shot-stopping ability immediately raise the standard of our squad. Kailen brings a strong mentality and professionalism that will be invaluable both on and off the pitch, and we’re confident she will play a key role in helping us achieve our objectives moving forward,” said Courage Chief Soccer Officer Ceri Bowley.\n\nInternationally, she has 63 appearances for the Canada Women’s National Team. In 2020, with her country, won the 2020 Olympic Gold Medal. She has represented her country at two World Cups and Olympics.\n\nAfter the departure of Casey Murphy, goalkeeper became a priority for NC Courage. And now, the club just brought in one of the very best. North Carolina will be a team to watch in 2026 after narrowly missing the playoffs this past season.",

    "title": "Packers vs. Bears playoff preview: Who the edge in turnovers and situationally?",
    "description": "Playoff games often come down to winning the turnover battle and coming up big in the biggest situations. Who has the edge between Packers and Bears?",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers (9-7-1) are going on the road to play the Chicago Bears (11-6) in the NFC Wild Card Round on Saturday at Soldier Field. The rubber match between the two NFC North rivals will determine who goes to the NFC Divisional Round and who is headed for the offseason.\n\nFootball is a complicated game, but finding the reasons for winning individual matchups between teams each week is often a straightforward exercise. What wins games? Excellent quarterback play, winning the line of scrimmage, taking care of the football and taking it away, controlling the important situations and overcoming or taking advantage of the injury situation.\n\nSo, who has the edge in the turnover department and in the game's biggest situations?\n\nTakeaways: GB, 14 (26th) CHI, 33 (1st)\n\nInterceptions: GB, 7 (28th) CHI, 23 (1st)\n\nFumbles recovered: GB, 7 (17th) CHI, 10 (4th)\n\nGiveaways: GB, 13 (3rd) CHI, 11 (1st)\n\nInterceptions thrown: GB, 7 (1st) CHI, 7 (1st)\n\nFumbles lost: GB, 6 (6th) CHI, 4 (3rd)\n\nTurnover differential: GB, +1 (12th) CHI, +22 (1st)\n\nW-L when winning turnover battle: GB, 5-1 CHI, 10-1\n\nThird down % (offense): GB, 48.8 (2nd) CHI, 42.7 (7th)\n\nThird down % (defense): GB, 39.4 (14th) CHI, 40.8 (22nd)\n\nThird down passer rating: GB, 101.2 (3rd) CHI, 97.2 (9th)\n\nRed zone TD% (offense): GB, 57.6 (14th) CHI, 58.2 (12th)\n\nRed zone TD% (defense): GB, 59.6 (21st) CHI, 56.1 (15th)\n\nRed zone TD passes: GB, 18 (7th) CHI, 14 (15th)\n\nFourth down % (offense): GB, 56.0 (18th) CHI, 51.7 (21st)\n\nFourth down % (defense): GB, 55.6 (18th) CHI, 47.8 (8th)\n\nPoints off turnovers: GB, 16 (31st) CHI, 90 (2nd)\n\nHow important will turnovers and situational football be in the rubber match? The first matchup featured an interception in the red zone on fourth down. The rematch featured a fumble inside the 10-yard line and a game-tying touchdown pass in the red zone on fourth down, and the Bears were only in the game because the offense failed on five trips inside the 20.\n\nWhile the Packers appear to have some slight situational edges, especially on third down, the Bears will go into Saturday with massive advantages in the turnover department. Arguably no team has been more dependent on turnovers to win games this season than the Bears, who have a takeaway in 15 of 17 games and lead the league in takeaways and turnover differential this season.\n\nConsider all this: the Bears have multiple takeaways in nine games this season and are 9-0 in those games. When not generating at least two takeaways? The Bears are 2-6, including a Week 14 loss to the Packers and back-to-back losses to end the season. And when not getting any turnovers? The Bears are 0-2, with a 31-point loss and a 14-point loss.\n\nJordan Love and Caleb Williams have similar turnover-worthy play percentages in 2025. Both have been elite at avoiding the dangerous play, complicating the path for the Packers to generate a takeaway but also making life difficult on the turnover-dependent Bears. Both teams are averaging fewer than one giveaway a game in 2025.\n\nTurnovers have often killed the Packers. An interception in Cleveland helped spark the comeback. A fumble in Dallas set up a go-ahead touchdown before the half. A fumble in the red zone versus Carolina hurt late. An interception in Denver turned the game. A lost fumble in Chicago cost the Packers what could have been game-ending points. These are the moments Green Bay must avoid against the Bears on Saturday.\n\nThe red zone has been a telling area for the Packers all season. When they score touchdowns inside the 20, they are hard to beat. But several of Green Bay's worst losses this season have been a direct result of failures in the red zone, including the Week 16 loss in Chicago (0-for-5 scoring touchdowns). During a two-week stretch in Denver and Chicago, the Packers went 1-for-9. In what could be a high scoring but low possession contest, scoring in the red zone will be absolutely vital for both teams. The Packers know it. The Bears know it. The red zone is the X-factor on Saturday.\n\nThird down was a strength for Love throughout the 2025 season. He will push the ball past the sticks and aggressively make throws to convert (or attempt to convert) on third down. Defensively, the Packers were dominating on third down with Micah Parsons, but getting off the field has gotten more difficult without the closer disrupting quarterbacks and creating negative plays. At this point, neither team has the pass-rush to consistently dominate on third down. Love has been one of the NFL's best on third down, and Williams remains one of the NFL's most creative off-schedule playmakers regardless of down.\n\nOverall, the Bears' ability to take the ball away and win the turnover battle looks like an overwhelming factor in Chicago's favor. Can the Packers protect the ball and convert in the red zone? A lot of points are possible if Love doesn't have the turnover and the Packers get the job done inside the 20. But as the first two meetings showed, every single play in the game's biggest moments matter. The guess here is that we will be able to evaluate turnovers and situational football and easily identify the game's winner by the end of Saturday night.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Packers vs. Bears playoff preview: Who the edge in turnovers and situationally?",

Love it or hate it, it isn’t going anywhere—and every program in the country feels its impact.\n\nBut the portal also gives players the same flexibility coaches enjoy: the ability to leave when a better opportunity presents itself. On Thursday, former Texas A&M redshirt junior tight end Theo Melin Öhrström found exactly that, landing with an ACC‑bound program not too far from Aggieland.\n\nAccording to On3Sports’ Hayes Fawcett, Öhrström will join the SMU Mustangs for the 2026 season and is expected to arrive in Dallas with up to two years of eligibility remaining. The former four‑star prospect stayed through the coaching transition in College Station and continued to make steady progress, earning more snaps as his career unfolded. He was firmly in the mix to start for the Aggies in 2026, but ultimately opted for a fresh start.\n\nAt SMU, he’ll have a much clearer path as the main focus at the position and can serve as the veteran presence in a young tight end room next season.\n\nYou can see his announcement below.\n\nBREAKING: Texas A&M transfer TE Theo Melin Ohrstrom has Committed to SMU, he tells @On3Sports\n\nHe totaled 352 yards and 3 TDs in his time with the Aggieshttps://t.co/RlUbB6Fk7q pic.twitter.com/sYJsfYzlSk\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 8, 2026\n\nThe NCAA football transfer portal opened Jan. 2 and runs through Jan. 16.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions.

(We're told ownership wants to recommend that he be retained by the new head coach there.)\n\nIn previous seasons, the Cowboys would look at only a handful of candidates, rather than interviewing as many as possible.\n\nBut our own Mike Fisher has stated that having 10-15 coaching candidates come through and offer their thoughts on how your team can improve is invaluable. Even if you don't intend to hire them, pick their brains.\n\nWhy not get as much outside information on where your team can improve?\n\nLeonhard is the most accomplished of the three - and he's got a Schotty background.\n\nThe bad news on Daronte Jones? He's a Flores assistant ... which means you might not get Flores, who is seeking a head coaching job.\n\nThe bad news on Banda? Same thing as it relates to Schwartz.\n\nBut at least there is this: Cowboys Nation didn't want the franchise to sit on its hands in this coaching search and waste days while other top candidates get snapped up.\n\nAnd thankfully, Dallas is being proactive.",

    "description": "BOOOOOOM! Utah defensive end John Henry Daley is transferring to Michigan Football! The All-American is considered a Top-10 player in the transfer portal:",
    "fullText": "The Wolverines just landed a huge target through the transfer portal, as former Utah defensive end John Henry Daley is transferring to Michigan to reunite with head coach Kyle Whittingham and edge coach Lewis Powell.\n\nBREAKING: Utah star transfer EDGE John Henry Daley has committed to Michigan, @PeteNakos reports〽️https://t.co/U31NaOwVgy pic.twitter.com/nqFLdW9LL4\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 9, 2026\n\nMichigan beat out Notre Dame and LSU — two places he also visited — as well as BYU in this portal recruitment.\n\nDaley was a three-star high school recruit in the 2021 recruiting class and, as a legacy recruit, chose to go to BYU. After a two-year mission trip with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Brazil, he got on campus and took a redshirt season in 2023 before entering the transfer portal that offseason and heading to Utah.\n\nAfter a minimal-impact 2024 season with the Utes — and only tallying seven total tackles and one sack his first two years in college — Daley had a breakout season this season that resulted in him being named a Second-Team All-American and a First-Team All-Big 12 performer. The 6-foot-4, 255-pounder racked up 48 total tackles, 17.5 tackles for loss, 11.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and one pass deflection in 11 games in 2025.\n\nUnfortunately, Daley’s season came to an abrupt halt when he suffered a non-contact lower-leg injury — reported as a ruptured Achilles — in the penultimate game of the regular season. While he may not be fully recovered by the time spring ball rolls around, he is expected to make a full recovery and be ready to go for the 2026 season.\n\nInjury be damned, Daley still graded out near the top of Pro Football Focus at his position this year. Daley earned a 92.4 overall grade, good for No. 5 at the edge spot in the country only behind David Bailey (Texas Tech, 93.6), Rueben Bain Jr. (Miami, 92.9), Michael Heldman (Central Michigan, 92.8) and Romello Height (Texas Tech, 92.6). Daley also had the second-best pass rush grade (93.7) in the country, just barely behind Bailey (93.9).\n\nWith Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham off to the NFL Draft, defensive end was one of the top needs for the Wolverines in the portal this winter. You can now consider that need checked, although I certainly wouldn’t turn down another edge rusher through the portal if they wanted in. Regardless of what happens next, landing Daley is a massive move for Whittingham and provides defensive coordinator Jay Hill with an instant impact player at a premium position.\n\nDaley — who is rated as the No. 4 overall player in the portal by On3, and the No. 49 overall player in the portal by 247Sports — will have two years of collegiate eligibility remaining. He’s the fifth player to transfer to Ann Arbor this winter, joining Pitt long snapper Nico Crawford, UNLV punter Cam Brown, Pitt kicker Trey Butkowski and Oklahoma running back Taylor Tatum.\n\nCheck out some of Daley’s best highlights at Utah in the video below.",

    "fullText": "For anyone who thought that Bo Bichette might take a shorter-term contract in free agency—think again. Insider Jon Heyman is reporting that the much-sought-after free agent is looking for a massive $300 million deal. While it seems highly unlikely he’ll get that from anyone, it sounds like two teams are intensifying talks with the infield All-Star.\n\nWhile his longtime team, the Toronto Blue Jays, continue their flirtation with top free agent Kyle Tucker, Bichette is now getting seriously wooed by both the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Phillies are meeting with Bo Bichette \"in the coming days\", per @MattGelb pic.twitter.com/3HhgtQHwUl\n\n— Talkin' Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) January 8, 2026\n\nA report from Philadelphia Phillies beat writer Matt Gelb reveals that the Phils will be meeting with Bichette in the next few days, likely on Monday.\n\nGelb reports that the team has done “extensive work on the various roster ripple effects of signing him.\n\n“The club’s interest in Bichette is legitimate, and if it results in a deal, it would likely require the team to move on from roster mainstays J.T. Realmuto and Alec Bohm.”\n\nBohm, the Phillies third baseman, just agreed Thursday to a $10.2 million contract for 2026. A trade of Bohm may be necessitated by a Bichette signing, both to free up his money, and to open up a spot in the infield.\n\nRealmuto’s return to Philly in free agency is somewhat in doubt. He’s been a two-time All-Star and a two-time Gold Glover behind the plate for the Phillies over the past seven years.\n\nAs for the Yankees, the Jays’ heated division rival is looking a lot more closely at Bichette as well. This comes as their talks with their own free agent Cody Bellinger have stagnated.\n\nYankees are taking a closer look at Bo Bichette as there's still \"a bit of a gap\" in negotiations with Cody Bellinger. @JonHeyman pic.twitter.com/sWOPNnF6qd\n\n— New York Post Sports (@nypostsports) January 8, 2026\n\nHeyman calls it an “interesting development” as the Yanks are now taking a closer look at Bichette due to the fact that there’s still “a bit of a gap” in their negotiations with Bellinger. The Yankees made a second offer to Belli in recent days. The two sides, however, remain apart.\n\nThe insider also reiterates that New York is listening to trade offers on second baseman Jazz Chisholm, which would open up a spot for Bichette. The lifetime shortstop played second during the World Series for Toronto.\n\nRumor Warns NY Mets Fans That Kyle Tucker Could Be Another Jason Bay\n\nNY Mets or LA Dodgers Could Soon Sign Kyle Tucker at Team-Friendly Price\n\n5 NY Yankees Options if They Soon Lose Cody Bellinger in Free Agency, Including Byron Buxton",

    "fullText": "Michigan football fans have been a little uneasy about the transfer portal, having lost a bunch of players (before getting most of the top players back) while not really adding many.\n\nThe Wolverines opened up by getting three special teams specialists -- longsnapper Nico Crawford, punter Cameron Brown, and kicker Trey Butkowski. They followed those up with a surprise running back commit, as Oklahoma's Taylor Tatum, the No. 1 RB in the 2024 class, ended up signing with the maize and blue on Thursday.\n\nBut the visits to Ann Arbor really started to pick up steam starting on Wednesday, and among those who made it to campus was former Utah edge rusher John Henry Daley. Daley is one of the top EDGEs in the portal and obviously has familiarity, having been coached by Kyle Whittingham and now-Michigan edge rusher coach Lewis Powell. He originally played at BYU before transferring to Utah, so he also has familiarity with Jay Hill through his time in Provo.\n\nThough he had made a bevy of visits (to LSU and Notre Dame), he opted to come to the Wolverines, making his commitment official.\n\nBREAKING: Utah star transfer EDGE John Henry Daley has committed to Michigan, @PeteNakos reports〽️https://t.co/U31NaOwVgy pic.twitter.com/nqFLdW9LL4\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 9, 2026\n\nAccording to PFF, Daley had the second-best grade of consistently playing edge rushers in all of 2025. He had a 93.7 grade and finished with 11.5 sacks and a win rate of 24.1% -- good for sixth in the country.\n\nThe Utah native has two years of eligibility remaining and should be a productive pickup for the maize and blue straight out of the gates. That is pending a lower-leg injury he sustained at the end of his career with the Utes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: Michigan football lands elite EDGE John Henry Daley in transfer portal",

    "description": "Trent and Cheryl Chambliss welcomed their son, Trinidad, in August 2002",
    "fullText": "Trent and Cheryl Chambliss share two sons, Tyler and Trinidad\n\nTrinidad's father also played college football for Grand Rapids Community College and coached the sport at the quarterback's high school\n\nThe football star maintained his tradition of praying with his mom before every game, even after he transferred to Ole Miss in 2025\n\nTrinidad Chambliss’ rapid rise from a backup Division II transfer to an Ole Miss starter has been nothing short of extraordinary. But his parents, Trent and Cheryl Chambliss, have worked to keep his meteoric ascent in perspective.\n\n“If you’re not having fun, then what’s the whole point?” Trent told the Daily Journal in October 2025. “But you can’t win every game. So therefore, how do you end up learning? How do you grow? … What do we do the next day? And what do we learn? What are they teaching us?”\n\nThe couple raised their two sons, Trinidad and his older brother, Tyler, in Grand Rapids, Mich. Trent is a high school administrator, while Cheryl, now retired, spent her career as a juvenile probation officer, per Yahoo! Sports. Trinidad's father introduced him to the sport and even coached football at his son's high school.\n\nThose early lessons followed the quarterback after he transferred from Division II Ferris State University to the University of Mississippi in 2025. Trinidad unexpectedly moved into the starting lineup after the starter quarterback was injured and has since helped the Rebels become a contender in the 2025 college football playoffs, per Grand Rapids Magazine. Trent and Cheryl have continued to be a constant presence at his games.\n\nHere's everything to know about Trinidad Chambliss' parents, Trent and Cheryl Chambliss.\n\nThough Cheryl and Trent grew up miles apart — she was born in New Jersey and he's from South Bend, Ind. — they eventually made their way to Grand Rapids, the Daily Journal reported. There, they met while practicing for a 3-on-3 basketball tournament and got to know each other more through their mutual friends.\n\nEventually, the couple tied the knot and went on to welcome two sons: Tyler and Trinidad.\n\nTrinidad seems to have inherited his love for football from his dad. Trent moved from his hometown to Grand Rapids to play football at Grand Rapids Community College. But unlike his son, Trent was an offensive lineman, per the Clarion Ledger.\n\nTrinidad's father went on to coach football at Forest Hills Northern, a local high school that Trinidad later attended. According to Grand Rapids Magazine, the future Ole Miss quarterback would play on the school's fields as a kid and starred on its football and basketball teams as a student.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Trent has worked at a number of schools in Michigan and has served as the assistant principal of Wyoming High School since 2022.\n\nAccording to the Daily Journal, Cheryl worked as a juvenile probation officer for 30 years before she retired. After saying goodbye to her decades-long career, she started working as a substitute teacher and as a receptionist for a mental health practice in Michigan.\n\n\"Cheryl’s extensive experience at the Juvenile Court has equipped her with a deep understanding of the human experience and the complexities individuals face,\" her bio reads. \"This insight allows her to address inquiries, provide information, and guide you through the process, ensuring that each person feels heard, supported, and well-informed.\"\n\nTrent and Cheryl share two sons, Tyler and Trinidad. Tyler was born first, followed by Trinidad on Aug. 24, 2002.\n\nThe couple told the Daily Journal in October 2025 that they agreed Cheryl would name their second child if they were a girl and Trent would if they were a boy. Though his wife claimed that Trinidad was named after the Spanish word for \"The Trinity,\" Trent argued that boxer Félix Trinidad inspired the moniker more.\n\n\"I kind of thought, ‘Man, this name Trinidad, boy, that sounds like a good name,’ ” he explained. “And then we ended up having the correlation of The Holy Trinity and the religious and spiritual connection, which made it even better.”\n\nTrent told the Daily Journal that his son has always been athletically gifted and \"could catch before he could walk.\" Trinidad was involved in a wide array of sports from an early age, and, according to Cheryl, he \"always had a ball in his hand.\"\n\nThough he also played soccer, baseball and basketball, Trinidad ultimately fell in love with football. Trent, who was coaching at the time, began teaching his son quarterback drills during his meetings when Trinidad was just 6 or 7 years old.\n\nHis parents recalled playfully hitting him with pool noodles during his progressions, a routine that eventually drew in a growing group of neighborhood kids for daily practices.\n\n\"Before you knew it, he had a whole team of kids, like you were watching a little Pee Wee practice or just a school team,” Cheryl told the Daily Journal. \"And Trinidad just absolutely loved it. It wasn’t something that he was forced to do, it wasn’t something that he begrudged. He thoroughly enjoyed it.”\n\nWhile Trinidad was playing at Ferris State, he would run to the fence during warmups to pray with his mother. The quarterback and his mom told the Clarion Ledger that they were able to continue their pre-game tradition even after he transferred to Ole Miss.\n\nAfter Chambliss runs out of the tunnels, he finds his mom in the stands and the two recite a prayer together.\n\n“It's been surreal and it's been amazing and we just feel it's such a blessing,\" Cheryl said, referring to her son's success at the university. \"It's been really great for people to see what we already knew about our son, that he has talent, that he has ability to lead.\"",

Together, we will bring the untold stories of athletes shaping the future of the sport to a national television audience.”\n\nVICE TV has quietly expanded its footprint in combat sports over the past few years. The network debuted Dark Side of the Cage in early 2025 and currently airs BKB Bare Knuckle Boxing as well as PFL’s international events, signaling a broader push into fight programming.\n\nWhile some fans may question leaving UFC Fight Pass due to its established MMA audience, Soares believes the move will significantly increase LFA’s reach.\n\n“Before, UFC Fight Pass distributed our events worldwide through their platform,” Soares told Sherdog. “Now, we’re negotiating distribution in over 200 markets. In the U.S., VICE TV will bring LFA into 45 million homes. When you combine TV and streaming, we expect at least five times the audience.”\n\nIn markets without finalized broadcast partners — including Brazil — LFA events will stream on the promotion’s official YouTube channel.",

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Pete Nakos, Michigan defensive back Jayden Sanders plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal. Sanders is a former highly sought-after recruit but only spent one season in Ann Arbor with the Wolverines. He now hits the open market with a ton of potential and eligibility on his hands.\n\nPlaying time actually went to Sanders’ way early and often. He played in all 13 games for the Wolverines as a true freshman. A nice 23 tackles are on the stat sheet, as is one pass breakup. Michigan certainly thought they were getting a look at somebody who was going to be a major contributor in the future.\n\nSanders played high school football at Kilgore (TX), where he was a four-star prospect. He was the No. 176 overall recruit in the 2025 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.\n\nA few other local schools were after Sanders before Michigan wound up being his destination out of high school. Oklahoma State was another out-of-state program, while in-state Baylor wanted to sign the blue-chip defensive back. Another opportunity will officially present itself once Sanders pops up in the portal.\n\n“It’s been huge, man,” former Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore said of Sanders during the regular season. “I remember me and [defensive coordinator] Wink [Martindale], it was maybe the fifth or sixth day of training camp. Wink came up to me and was like, ‘That guy’s going to help us this year.’ I was like, ‘I think so.’ And it came to fruition.”\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "fullText": "The Wisconsin Badgers picked up a second quarterback in the transfer portal on Thursday, as Louisville Cardinals transfer Deuce Adams committed to the program after a visit, per ESPN’s Pete Thamel.\n\nAdams, a former three-star recruit in the Class of 2024, was a redshirt freshman at Louisville this past season, completing 15 of 21 passes for 112 yards as the Cardinals’ No. 2 quarterback behind senior Miller Moss.\n\nAdams started one game for Louisville this season, completing 12 of 17 passes for 94 yards in a 38-6 loss to the SMU Mustangs. He ultimately played in seven games across two seasons at Louisville. After entering the portal, the Texas native received interest from multiple programs, including the Michigan Wolverines and James Madison Dukes.\n\nHowever, those visits were scheduled after Adams’s trip to Madison on Thursday, and the redshirt freshman ultimately committed to Wisconsin on his visit. The Badgers had been interested in several younger quarterbacks as they sought a second addition in the transfer portal, including Kansas true freshman transfer David McComb, who had visited Madison earlier in the week.\n\nBut, with one spot available, Adams was the choice, committing to the program first. He becomes the fifth scholarship quarterback for the Badgers in 2025, joining Colton Joseph, Carter Smith, Danny O’Neil, and incoming freshman Ryan Hopkins.\n\nJoseph is the team’s projected starter after coming in from Old Dominion, where he was one of the country’s top dual-threat quarterbacks in 2025. Smith was the starter for Wisconsin’s final games of the season, and the Badgers were able to retain him after some conversations with the staff. He currently projects as Wisconsin’s No. 2 quarterback to start the year, with Danny O’Neil nursing his long-term injury.\n\nHopkins, a four-star recruit in the Class of 2026, will likely need some time to develop, so Adams currently slots in as the No. 3 quarterback with the chance to compete for the backup spot this season.",

Following the season, the Jets parted ways with Steve Wilks and have begun requesting interviews with potential replacements.\n\nMORE: Hear Stephen A.

Jones is also scheduled to interview with the Dallas Cowboys for their defensive coordinator position.\n\nMinnesota’s defense finished among the top three units in the NFL this season, with only Houston and Seattle potentially outperforming them. However, Jones may choose to be patient as he weighs his options, particularly given uncertainty surrounding the Vikings’ defensive staff.

    "fullText": "Tonight’s Fiesta Bowl between the Miami Hurricanes and the Ole Miss Rebels will feature several players the Seattle Seahawks could draft in 2026. There’s one name in particular to watch, and several others to know.\n\nMost likely for the Seahawks to draft is Miami edge rusher Akheem Mesidor. He put the nation on watch with a dominant performance in the Cotton Bowl, helping Miami upset the defending national champion Ohio State Buckeyes. He’s been easy to overlook with the naked eye this year while playing opposite potential top-10 pick Rueben Bain on the defensive line, but is finally getting the respect he deserves. On 29 pass rush reps in the game, he garnered 6 pressures and 2 sacks. Seamocks.com blogger Jared Stanger wrote about him as a potential fit within Mike Macdonald’s defense back in November, being his lone mid-round fit at the position. Macdonald loves high-motor edge players, as evidenced by the Seahawks’ signing of DeMarcus Lawrence, and advanced pass rushers, as shown with his willingness to retain Uchenna Nwosu. Mesidor is the top draft prospect for Seahawks fans to watch tonight, and likely for the team’s scouts, too.\n\nOther names on Miami to know include tackle Francis Mauigoa (probably goes too high for Seattle to have a chance), cornerbacks Keionte Scott (who had a pick-six against Ohio State) and Ethan O’Connor (former Washington State Cougar), safety Jakobe Thomas (excellent size and ball skills could be a fit in Seahawks defense), and wide receiver CJ Daniels (could be a good complement to receiving corps next season).\n\nI wrote about Rueben Bain earlier in the season, but his draft stock is sky-high and the Seahawks draft pick will be late. There has been some polarizing discussion about his arm length, since there hasn’t ever been a Pro Bowl-caliber NFL edge rusher with as short of arms as him. However, there also hasn’t ever been one in college with that lack of arm length. Bain is already an anomaly and is too dominant to overlook, but he’ll be polarizing among fans and league circles alike. Some teams who value length more will have him graded as a second-round pick, but enough teams will fall in love with him that he should still go in the top half of the first round.\n\nOle Miss’ isn’t as loaded for the 2026 draft, more towards 2027. Their possible Seahawks come late April include linebacker Suntarine Perkins (could be a Tyrice Knight-esque build should they decide to add depth), cornerback Antonio Kite (likely Day 3 cornerback), wide receivers De’Zhaun Stribling (another former WSU Cougar) and Cayden Lee (underrated receiver due to size with great hands and route-running technique), and edge rusher Princewill Umanmielen (brother Princely was drafted to the Carolina Panthers last year).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Potential 2026 Seahawks in CFP Semifinal between Miami and Ole Miss",

    "fullText": "In a surprising move earlier this week, the Cleveland Browns' division rival, the Baltimore Ravens, made when they fired their head coach, John Harbaugh. He had been with the team for 18 seasons with an overall record of 193-124, including a Super Bowl win. Harbaugh has been one of the most consistent coaches in the NFL for a while, so parting ways with him is awfully risky for the Ravens; the grass isn't always greener on the other side.\n\nCleveland.com's Browns Insider Mary Kay Cabot is reporting that the Browns are \"definitely doing their diligence\" on Harbaugh and that you can expect Cleveland to be on his list of interviews when he starts interviewing next week. This would be a slam dunk for the Browns if they could bring in Harbaugh to replace Kevin Stefanski as the team's head coach.\n\nThe Browns are casting a wide net, trying to find the right head coach to finally turn things around consistently and make them legitimate contenders.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns could be desired destination of former Ravens HC John Harbaugh",

    "fullText": "Colts GM sends clear message about Daniel Jones' future in Indianapolis originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nQuarterback Daniel Jones’ future with the Indianapolis Colts will be a main topic of conversation this offseason.\n\nJones was having a very solid season for the Colts before suffering a torn Achilles in Week 14. Given that he was on the last year of his contract, the injury raised some serious questions regarding the future of the 28-year-old QB in Indianapolis. Did the Colts still think he could be their guy moving forward? Would they look to go in a different direction?\n\nColts general manager Chris Ballard answered some of those questions at his second-ending news conference, and his comments sure made it sound like the teams plans to bring him back.\n\n\"I'm looking at him both near and long [term],\" Ballard said of Jones. \"When you're chasing the quarterback all the time, it makes it very hard. Your margin for error really shrinks down. And I feel very good about Daniel Jones and where he's at, where he's going. Yes, he's got the Achilles. But I think Daniel Jones has got a really bright future here in Indianapolis.\"\n\nEven with the Achilles injury, Jones will likely have other suitors in free agency given the lack of quarterback depth in the class. However, he has recently indicated that he would like to remain in Indianapolis.\n\n\"I've enjoyed being here, working with the coaching staff here, the players,\" Jones said. \"I think it's a great organization and I've enjoyed being here. Obviously there's a business side to it and understand that, but I've really enjoyed being here around these people.\"\n\nJones also doesn't think that the injury will impact his availability for next season, no matter where he plays.\n\n\"But I expect to be ready to go by training camp,\" Jones said. \"We'll attack the process and make sure I'm ready to go.\"\n\nJones is headed for unrestricted free agency in March, but he could potentially come to an agreement on a new deal with the Colts before then.",

    "fullText": "CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Browns opened their head coach search on Thursday by interviewing defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz and offensive coordinator Tommy Rees.\n\nGeneral manager Andrew Berry had said he would consider both coordinators for the opening. The Browns fired Kevin Stefanski on Monday after six seasons and a 36-58 overall mark. Stefanski was a two-time AP NFL Coach of the Year, but Cleveland had a 8-26 mark the past two seasons.\n\nSchwartz, 59, has head coaching experience, leading the Detroit Lions from 2009 through 2013. He had a 29-52 overall record and led the Lions to the playoffs in 2011, three seasons after they were the first NFL team to go 0-16.\n\nSchwartz has been the architect of one of the league's top defenses the last three seasons. Cleveland led the league in total defense in 2023 and ranked fourth this season as Myles Garrett recorded 23 sacks and broke the NFL single-season record.\n\n“Jim’s an outstanding football coach. We have a lot of respect for him, a lot of appreciation for him, and he has certainly earned the right for consideration,” Berry said.\n\nSafety Grant Delpit and other defensive players are hoping Schwartz will remain, either as head coach or coordinator.\n\n“I think it goes without saying what kind of coach he is and the energy he brings. I think coach Schwartz is going to be a great, still-got-it type of head coach. He’s a fiery guy and I’d vouch for him,” Delpit said. “I think that he’s taken our defense and brought it to an elite level and kept it there.”\n\nRees came to Cleveland in 2024 as tight ends coach and pass game specialist before being promoted to offensive coordinator this season. He had play-calling responsibilities for the final nine games and was credited along with quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave for Shedeur Sanders' development during his seven games as the starter.\n\nRees was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Alabama in 2023 under Nick Saban after six seasons at Notre Dame. He was quarterbacks coach at his alma mater from 2017-22 and added offensive coordinator duties in 2020.\n\n“He’s a very talented young coordinator. He’s held in very high regard, not just in college football, but across the NFL,” Berry said.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "While wrestlers go to great lengths to condition their bodies, tidy up their appearance, and maintain their brand, wrestling itself is anything but pretty. WWE Women's EVOLVE Champion Kendal Grey learned that the hard way when a sharp knee strike to the face from reigning \"NXT\" Women's Champion Jacy Jayne sent the young upstart to the dentist. Other champions might have sent flowers to Grey's resting bed, but Jayne, instead, took to social media to welcome Grey to the lifestyle.\n\n\"Welcome to the biz kid,\" Jayne wrote simply.\n\nMidday Thursday, Jayne reposted and responded to Grey's tooth-related call-out post. In Grey's original post, the WWE EVOLVE Women's Champion posted a clip of the fateful knee to the jaw that sent her to the nearest dentist's office, and tagged Jayne's social media account in her caption. While the extent of Grey's tooth injury is unclear, the \"NXT\" upstart nevertheless promised to return the favor to Jayne in the future, prompting Jayne's snarky response. As of writing, Jayne's remark has surpassed nearly 8,000 views on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWelcome to the biz kid https://t.co/0Lk6AJk0ZF\n\n— Jacy Jayne (@jacyjaynewwe) January 8, 2026\n\nFans were vocal with support under Jayne's post, with a leading comment calling Jayne \"one of the best knee strikers in the game.\" Others praised Jayne for her dominant \"NXT\" run, while several netizens called Jayne \"mother,\" a term of endearment in queer and Gen Z online spaces. Grey has yet to respond to Jayne's comments.\n\nThe strike that sent Grey to the dentist's chair office comes from her \"NXT\" Women's Championship match at Tuesday's New Years Evil event, where she unsuccessfully challenged for Jayne's title in an contest full of vicious strikes, top-rope moves, and Fatal Influence interference. If rumors are true, however, Grey may not have long to score payback on Jayne, as rumors of a main roster call-up for the Fatal Influence leader run rampant.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

He tallied 15 tackles, 2.0 tackles for a loss and 0.5 sacks. He started two games.\n\nPrior to enrolling at Penn State, Gilliam was ranked as a three-star prospect and the No. 741 overall recruit in the 2023 class, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking. He also checked in as the No. 63 defensive lineman in the class and the No. 25 overall player from the state of Maryland, hailing from Gaithersburg (MD) Quince Orchard.\n\nHe was rated as a four-star prospect in the On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings. He was the No. 67 overall recruit, and the No. 6 overall defensive lineman available after entering their name into the portal before committing to a new beginning.\n\nIn high school, Gilliam was a three-year letterman and had an outstanding senior campaign. His team finished with an 11-1 record and Gilliam earned first-team All-Metro honors as a result.\n\nFormer LSU offensive lineman Ory Williams has committed to Tennessee, via the NCAA Transfer Portal, according to On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Williams spent two seasons at LSU.\n\nWilliams made 12 appearances and two starts in the 2025 campaign for the Tigers. As a true freshman, Williams played in just one game before ultimately redshirting. He has three years of eligibility remaining.\n\nOry Williams played high school football at San Marcos (TX), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 460 overall player and No. 30 offensive tackle in the 2024 recruiting cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Rankings.\n\nWilliams only played two years of high school football and quickly rose up the national ranks. At 6-foot-8, 335 pounds, Williams boasts professional size. As of this report, he is the No. 38 offensive tackle in On3’s 2026 Transfer Portal Player Rankings.\n\nWilliams visited Tennessee on Sunday.

The men there thought it was unusual for a woman to be so interested in engineering.\n\nAfter the war, she asked women which electrical appliances they would like in their homes.\n\nIn 1924 Caroline was in charge of an association that taught women about electricity.\n\nShe later helped the government improve science education for girls.\n\nDuring World War Two Caroline went on important missions for the British government.\n\nCaroline became a Dame in 1947. She is remembered for opening up the world of engineering to women.\n\nThere is a primary school in Buckinghamshire named after her.\n\nCaroline Haslett was a member of the suffragette movement.\n\nIn 1947 she was made a Dame for her work for the government.\n\nBack in time with...Astonishing Activists game! game\n\nPlay this fun game to learn about Nelson Mandela, Emmeline Pankhurst, Rosa Parks and Guy Fawkes.",

Earlier in the day, Iran severed all IPv6 connectivity when the country withdrew all of its IPv6 BGP routes at 11:49 UTC (3:19pm local). At 16:30 UTC (8pm local), traffic volumes into the country began a steady descent until the last remaining pieces of connectivity were disabled a little more than an hour ago.\n\nThe internet shutdown marks an ominous development for the situation in Iran, echoing the November 2019 protests (also known as Bloody November), which featured a similar national internet blackout and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Iranians.\n\nDoug Madory is the director of internet analysis for Kentik where he works on internet infrastructure analysis.

I’m Ron Minsky. It is my\ngreat pleasure to introduce Richard Eisenberg. Richard’s a senior\ncontributor to the Haskell ecosystem. He’s worked on Haskell’s type\nsystem in a lot of different ways over the last eight years. He’s on\nthe GHC Steering Committee. He’s the Chair of the Haskell\nFoundation. One might wonder, what’s he doing here? Well, it turns out\nRichard has joined Jane Street. He’s working on our Tools and\nCompilers team, and in particular, working on the team that works on\nthe front end of the OCaml compiler. So, thanks for joining me,\nRichard.\n\nSo, maybe a good place to start out with is to talk about your\nbackground. You’ve done all this exciting work in the Haskell\necosystem. Maybe tell us a little bit more about how you got involved\nin Haskell and what kind of work you’ve done there.\n\nYeah, sure. I first really encountered Haskell when I went back to\ngraduate school. I’d been a high school teacher for a little while and\nthen I thought, ‘oh, you know, it’s time to get a Ph.D. in programming\nlanguages,’ kind of, as you do.\n\nIn the process toward that, I discovered dependent types. I didn’t\nwanna just show up in grad school and not know anything. So I did some\nbackground reading and I discovered that, you know, these fancy type\nsystems have so much expressiveness, and so much of a way of being\nable to sort of define what it is that you’re programming before you\neven write a line of code, that you can just express your ideas so\nmuch more clearly and then get the compiler to check that you actually\ndid it correctly. This was just sort of, you know, my brain exploded\nwhen I learned about this.\n\nI feel like, you know, I kind of pretend to know something about\nprogramming languages on TV, but like, actually my academic background\nis distributed systems, not programming languages, and there’s lots of\ngaps in my knowledge. And so, I kinda don’t really know what dependent\ntypes are. Can you give a suitably beginner-friendly explanation of\nwhat dependent types are?\n\nSure. And I’m gonna start by avoiding the trap of trying to define the\nterm, ‘dependent type.’\n\nAnd instead, just sort of describe ‘a language with dependent types\nallows you to do this thing.’ And that thing is to essentially encode\na proof of correctness into your program such that every time you\ncompile your program, that proof is checked. And so you know—if you’ve\nset things up the right way—that your program does what you think it\ndoes. And so, I’ll give a concrete example.\n\nAnd that is, to imagine a sorting function. So normally we think of a\nsorting function, let’s just say, it’s a function from a list of\n‘ints’ to a list of ints, right? It takes this list of ints’ input,\nand then does some transformation, and then produces a list. But\nactually, that’s a very loose description of a sorting function. We\ncan do better than that.\n\nI wanna say that a sorting function takes in a list of ints, and it\nproduces a list of ints in, I’m gonna say, non-descending order\n(because maybe there’s duplicates, so I don’t want to say ‘ascending\norder’ because someone out there might say that’s wrong). So we get\nthis list out that’s in non-descending order. Okay, that’s closer, but\nthat’s still not quite right because maybe my function just always\nreturned to the empty list. That’s a list in non-descending order.\n\nSo instead, I really want to say that it’s a function that takes in a\nlist of ints, and returns a result that is in non-descending order,\nand is a permutation of the input list. And that’s a rather glorious\ntype that I can assign to a sorting function. But it accurately\ndescribes what that sorting function does.\n\nAnd then I can implement that in any number of ways, using any of the\ncommon sorting algorithms that you learn in computer science, and any\nof those different algorithms will meet that specification, and then,\nif I’ve encoded this, my compiler will check that my algorithm\nactually does sorting and doesn’t do some other thing. And so now,\nhaving sort of explained that, I can return back and actually say what\nI mean by ‘dependent type.’\n\nA dependent type is a type that can depend on some input that you give\ninto a function, essentially. So, in this case, the output of the\nfunction, not just a list of ints, but the output depends on the\ninput. The output must be a permutation of the input. And so, that’s\nthe dependent type.\n\nSo when I started grad school, then I saw Haskell, and here was a\nlanguage that had this fancy type system and had all this\nexpressiveness. Didn’t quite have dependent types, but it had a lot of\nthat stuff. That just got me excited. And then, through that I started\nworking with Stephanie Weirich at University of Pennsylvania. She was\ndoing a lot of Haskell work. She collaborated a bunch with Simon\nPeyton Jones, who then I started collaborating with, and things just\nsort of took off from there. It was a pretty fast introduction into\nthat world.\n\nI wanna go a little deeper on that. I feel like we’ve started with\nthe, like, ‘Well, of course I got a Ph.D. in PL and was interested in\ndependent types.’ Like, how do you even get there? Where does your\ninterest and background in programming languages come [from] in the\nfirst place?\n\nSo, once upon a time, I wanted to program. I don’t know why I wanted\nto program. I was too little to have that level of introspection.\n\nSo I guess, uh, I learned Basic when I was, I think, five\nsomehow. There was a friend of my parents that decided I should learn\nBasic and so that happened.\n\nBut I then got more into it, I guess, when I was in 7th grade, so this\nwas, probably I was 12 years old. And someone told me that Pascal was\na good language to learn. So, you know, I pleaded with my parents and\neventually they bought me the Pascal compiler ‘cause back in those\ndays, you actually had to pay for compilers. At least on, sort of—we\nhad a Macintosh. If I had some kind of Unix system, maybe it would’ve\nbeen different.\n\nWell, which Pascal compiler did you use?\n\nUm, THINK Pascal? Was that a thing?\n\nTHINK Pascal, so not Borland. I guess Borland was \nDOS side of the world.\n\nYeah, yeah. Borland, yes, Borland was for like, ‘real programmers.’\n\nSo I got this, and somewhere along the way, I had decided that every\npiece of software should be, like, if you read the instruction manual,\nthat should tell you everything you need to know about that piece of\nsoftware. I don’t know why I assumed that, but that was my starting\npoint. And so, it came with these two big books and most of the books\nwere just like on compiler flags and setting up projects and none of\nthis stuff about programming. At the end of one of the books was a\nsyntax reference with no glosses, no further information, just a\nsyntax reference using those, sort of, block and line diagrams to\nrepresent recursive loops in the syntax. And I was like, ‘Okay, well,\nif my assumption is that this book defines how to program, and this is\nthe only thing it has, then all the information must be here.’\n\nSo I just stared at these syntax diagrams probably for hours and\nhours. Like, ‘Okay, what does all of this mean?’ And then eventually\nsort of bootstrapped my way into learning how to program Pascal. And\nso, that being my first ‘real programming experience,’ somehow that\nbuilt the structures in my brain just around syntax and languages, and\nit kind of went from there.\n\nAnd then fast-forward 10 years or so, and I took a PL course as an\nundergrad from Norman Ramsey and it just lit me up. It was just like,\nthis is really cool stuff. I really enjoy this kind of thinking. And\nit turned out, I took that at the end of my senior year of undergrad,\nand so it was sort of too late to immediately go into grad school at\nthat point and I had this whole machine going toward high school\nteaching. So I did that for a while, but then I ended up returning.\n\nI love that your entrée into programming was, roughly speaking, a\ntraumatic experience with syntax. That seems… (laughs)\n\nBut it wasn’t traumatic. It was fantastic. Somehow, this was just what\nI needed. This was what my 12-year-old-self needed: big syntax blocks.\n\n(laughs) Okay. So, you went off, you got your Ph.D., you started\nworking on Haskell. Where did it go from there?\n\nWell, I was working on my Ph.D. It was basically, Stephanie and I had\nthis idea about how to encode dependent types, but it required some\nmore support from the Haskell compiler. And so, I was pleading [with]\nthe Haskell people to create this for me. And then, eventually Simon\njust wrote and said, ‘Why don’t you just do it?’ And that was a new\nconcept for me. I was like, ‘I could influence this language? Well,\nyou know, I’m just this random person.’\n\nBut between Stephanie and Simon mentoring me, I got to a point where I\ncould contribute and then it just grew from there. So, [I] did a bunch\nof that as a Ph.D. student. Then after leaving my Ph.D., I was a\nprofessor for a few years at Bryn Mawr College. What was great about\nthat experience was, they were open to the idea that open source\ncontributions were a form of publication, right? A lot of professors\nhave a lot of pressure to keep producing papers. That was definitely\nthere for me, too. But alongside papers, I couldn’t just do\nsoftware. But I could do, sort of, traditional scholarly publications\nand software. So that gave me a chance to continue my implementation\nwork, remain a part of this open source community, while still doing\nthe high-level scholarly research that I had been doing. So that was a\nreally nice part of it.\n\nIt turned out that, to my great surprise, that—well, this wasn’t to my\ngreat surprise—it turned out that this was a lot of work. That\nmaintaining a research program with a bunch of papers every year, and\ndoing these open source contributions, and teaching, there was just\nmore than could comfortably fit into one job, especially during term\ntime. And to my own surprise, I realized that the teaching part was\nthe part that maybe I could pause on. I had done that full-time as a\nhigh school teacher for eight years, now I was back doing it. It was\nfun, but I thought it was time to sort of push in a slightly different\ndirection.\n\nSo after a couple years at Bryn Mawr, I left to join Tweed which is a\nsoftware consultancy based in Paris. They do a ton of Haskell\nwork. And they hired me, basically just to continue my contributions\nin the Haskell space. So, I continued doing research there, continued\ncontributing to the compiler there. And, you know, after a few years\nof that, that was fun, and I got to a point where I was looking to be\npart of a cohesive team all working together, and realizing that after\nso many years just working in one language, I was really ready to see\nwhat things were like in a different space. And so the timing worked\nout really well when you, Ron, reached out to me and started the\ndiscussions that led to me joining Jane Street.\n\nRight. And often in these interviews, I’ll ask someone, like, ‘so how\ndid you get here?’ But actually, I was part of the dramatis personae\nof how you actually arrived.\n\nYou were the—the dramatis personae, yeah. (laughs)\n\n(laughs) Right, which is, at some point, I was like, ‘oh, it would be\nreally good if Richard worked here,’ and I started reaching out and\ntrying to convince you to come. Which took, it’s important, I\ncalculated, 11 months from (laughs) when I started.\n\nYeah, yeah. That’s right. I mean, you know, of course the story [of]\nme coming to Jane Street starts with you asking me, and me saying\n‘No.’\n\nAnd again, it was a matter of timing. I’ve been aware of Jane Street\nfor a long time, been sort of wondering what was happening over there,\nand somehow when you first reached out, it just wasn’t the right time\nfor me yet. And then the second time, it was sort of a better time. I\ncouldn’t even tell you why. It’s just, this is the way that life\nflows.\n\nBut, you know, one of the barriers which we’ve joked about is that I\ngrew up in the New York area and actually ended up going to high\nschool in New York and commuting from New Jersey. So every day I was\ngoing back and forth across the George Washington Bridge, and swore to\nmyself then that I would never commute to and from New York City. And\nalso just sort of had this negative vibe from the financial industry,\nand I was just like, ‘I don’t know. Like, I want to be creating\nsomething that other people use,’ right?\n\nBut actually, this is fantastic. I’m having great fun. Part of it is\nthat I’m working as part of this larger ecosystem. It’s not just a\nclosed thing where I’m only doing stuff that’s internal to Jane\nStreet. But instead, contributing to this open source ecosystem,\nworking on an open language, OCaml, and really continuing some of\nthese research trends that I started 10 years ago. Now that I’m here,\nit just all fits very naturally together.\n\nI feel like, in general, one of my takeaways is that there’s lots of\ninteresting work in lots of different places and the preconceptions\nyou have when you are young often (laughs) don’t work out over\ntime. So a thing you talked about earlier is a topic that I feel like\nI should know something about, but don’t. I like your first high-level\ndescription ‘cause it actually lines up with the very little bit I\nknow about dependent types.\n\nAnd there’s also something that’s always made me a little nervous\nabout them because a basic fact about proofs is—proofs seem pretty\nhard to construct. People go to great trouble to build automated\nproving systems where you have tactic libraries, like, little tiny\nprograms that you can run to, like, ‘try this way or try that way’ of\ncoming up with a proof of a thing. And it all sounds really hard and\nwhen you talk to people who do kind of theorem proving on large scale\nsoftware systems, it sounds like a pretty challenging operation where\nthis is kind of a lot of engineering work that just goes into just\nconstructing the proof. So I’m curious how you think of the\npracticalities of that? Like, how convenient can you make it? And if\nyou make it a deeply embedded part of the programming process, does\nthat work well with the other things you might wanna do? Does it\ninterfere with the ordinary process of programming? How do you see the\npragmatics of that working out?\n\nYeah, that’s a great question. And this is a question that doesn’t\nhave an answer yet. This is, I think, still something that the\nprogramming languages community is grappling with. I have my own\ntakes, but this is still sort of an open question out there.\n\nI think, first of all, that for a programming language to be\neffective, everything needs to be opt-in, right? If you have a\nlanguage that supports dependent types—and there’s a bunch out\nthere. So actually, OCaml’s module system is a dependent type\nsystem. It’s missing one or two key features that makes it really sort\nof go. But that definitely has aspects of dependent types in\nit. Haskell has aspects of dependent types.\n\nThere are other languages, Coq, Agda, Idris, Lean, these are the ones\nthat really have embraced dependent types. But in any of these\nlanguages, you don’t have to use these dependent types. You can just\nwrite a sorting function that is described as ‘a list of ints to a\nlist of ints.’ That’s fine. And I think that’s a key aspect of any\nkind of system that’s gonna be using this dependent types feature,\nbecause not everyone wants to prove everything all the time. As you\nsay, proofs are expensive. And so, what you need is, you need the\nability to only prove the parts that you think are worthwhile proving.\n\nSo let’s say we have an important part of the system that might be\neasy to get wrong that we want to prove something about. How do we do\nthat? Is that still worth it? And one thing to think about is, what’s\nyour cost-benefit analysis, right? If you do this proving, can you\nspend less time on testing? Can you spend less time on debugging? Can\nyou spend less time on catastrophic failure because you missed\nsomething when debugging?\n\nIt is a lot harder to do these programs with proofs. But sometimes,\nthat’s really worth it. It’s a matter of applying good taste, like it\nis everywhere in programming, right? Any programming language gives\nyou a ton of tools to work with, and it takes time and experience and\ntaste to figure out when it’s time to use which tools.\n\nRight. And I do really like that, kind of, pay-as-you-go kind of\nattitude of, like, you want some kind of base language that’s\nrelatively simple to work with, and then the ability to add on more\nfeatures that give you more power of various kinds, and not be forced\nto pay for that complexity constantly in everything you do. Which is,\nI think, actually a really hard thing to get right in the design—of\nlike, not having these more powerful features leak in and corrupt the\nrest of your experience within the language.\n\nThat’s right. It’s a very careful thing. And my push in Haskell has\nbeen to try to increase or add new features to help support dependent\ntypes, and there’s been a large community of people really excited for\nthis. And in my measurement, my biased measurement, a smaller\ncommunity of people who have been saying, ‘No, no, no. Don’t do this\nbecause it’s gonna make it impossible to write simple programs.’ And\nmany, many, many times, I’ve had to reassure people, ‘No, no. All\nthose simple programs will continue to exist, they’ll continue to\nwork. You can do what you want.’ But I also wanna give power to people\nwho want to use the fancy dependent types.\n\nGreat. Okay. So let’s leave Haskell and dependent types behind for the\nmoment because that’s not primarily what you’re working on here. Maybe\nyou can tell us, what are you working on here? Like, what is the\nmission that you are on here, working on OCaml?\n\nSo, I’ll start more broadly and then I’ll get narrower. My broad\nmission is my belief that type systems are a fantastic way to\nstructure thought and structure programs. So by being able to write\ndown what you intend to do before doing it, then you can check what\nyou’ve done, and you can also help formulate your thoughts. And when I\nsay, ‘write down what you intend to do before doing it,’ I mean, write\ndown a specification in types.\n\nThe flip side of that, is that it must be the case that you can do\nthat without paying a one-time cost. It’s gonna be problematic if you\nwant to write an efficient program, and yet, by defining your program\ncarefully ahead of time, now it’s no longer as efficient at\nruntime. This checking and this writing of a specification should all\nhappen at compile time. This should be happening in front of the\nprogrammer and not in front of any users. If any of those details leak\ninto user land by slowing your program down or somehow interfering\nwith the operation of your program, then there’s a misdesign in the\nlanguage.\n\nSo coming down to what I’m actually working on here at Jane Street, so\nthe feature I’m working on is something called unboxed types. There’s\nvarious different ways of characterizing it, but one way to do so is,\nit allows inlining of type definitions. So what we might want to have\nin our design is to have a structure that has four fields that\ndescribe some aspects of a trade. And then maybe we store that\nstructure in some larger structure, and maybe that’s stored in some\nlarger structure.\n\nWell, if you do that the naïve way in OCaml, every time you store one\nstructure inside of another, it’s stored by a pointer. And it means\nnow when I wanna access the price of this trade that’s all the way\ndown (it’s a nested structure) I have to follow this pointer, then\nthat pointer, then that pointer, then that pointer, each time I have a\ncache miss, each time I have to load into memory. This is really bad.\n\nRight. And this highlights a kind of basic fact about OCaml, that it\nhas a very fancy, at least on the scale of modern language that people\nmight use, a very fancy type system and a brutally simple memory\nrepresentation. OCaml’s internal implementation might have been like a\nScheme or Lisp written in the mid-‘60s or something, which is to say,\neverything looks like either some immediate value, it’s no bigger than\na word that fits in a register, or a heap-allocated value, which is\nlike one header word and then one full word for every slot inside of\nit, and we have all the fancy, like, type goo on top of it that you\nwant, but all of the physical representation looks just like that.\n\nExactly. Exactly. It means that we’re building this beautiful type\ndiscipline in our software to try to avoid errors, and try to express\nourselves, and try to communicate more clearly among developers—and\nwe’re paying for that at runtime! This is ridiculous. To me, every\ntime a type system feature slows down your program or otherwise\ninterferes is just a misdesign. And so, the fact that this is our\ncurrent state of play is problematic. The task I’m working on is\ncoming up with a new design for OCaml’s type system, or this aspect of\nOCaml’s type system, that allows us to have this rich type structure\nwithout paying for it at runtime.\n\nThat’s right. Although it’s not that you can pick a type structure\nthat’s kind of oblivious to the performance details, right? In some\nsense it’s the opposite. The idea of the unboxed type work and a lot\nof the work that we’re doing now is really about taking design\ndecisions that have to do with performance and making them explicit at\nthe level of types.\n\nYes, that’s right. Because you can’t, I mean, in the end, we need to\nexecute this somehow. There needs to be an execution model. And so, if\nwe try to ignore all of these execution details in the type system,\nthen there’s not gonna be a way of making it fast. And so, the work\nis, in some sense, taking some of these execution-oriented details,\nmaking them manifest in the type system, getting programmers the\nability to write types that take these into account, so that we can\nthen execute fast.\n\nRight. In some sense, I think of this as really being about enabling\nperformance engineering, right? There’s kind of two different lines of\npeople thinking about how to optimize programs via compilers. One is,\nyou make your compiler smarter so it can do more and optimize things\nfor you. So the user can write kind of an ordinary program that just\nreflects, ‘what do they want to achieve and what’s the logical\nstructure,’ and then the compiler will, like, do something good. And\nthen, the other direction is trying to give a lot of precise\nunderstanding to the programmer so they can know exactly what they’re\ndoing and they can optimize their program. And these are both\nimportant.\n\nBut, like, in some sense the scale of optimizations are very\ndifferent. Like, if you come up with a way of making your compiler\nfaster that, like, takes most user programs and makes them 20% faster,\nthat’s an enormous win. Like, that’s a shockingly good\noutcome. Whereas, if you give people good performance engineering\ntools, the idea that they can think hard about a particular program\nand make it five, or 10, or 100 times faster is like, in some sense,\ntotally normal. And so, there’s a kind of extra power of giving\nindividuals the ability to optimize. It obviously misses out on scope\nand there’s something great about being able to go and in one swell\nfoop (laughs) make 20 different, or 100 different, or all the\ndifferent programs faster. But you can’t get the same kind of order of\nmagnitude of improvements that you can get from giving one programmer\nthe ability to really carefully engineer their system.\n\nWell, there’s a real tension because what in the end we’re doing in\nprogramming languages is, we’re trying to find a way for humans to\ncommunicate precisely to computers. And we have at our disposal our\ntool, one of our tools is the fact that this is happening on a\ncomputer. So we can write computer programs to try to sort of help\ncover this distance, right?\n\nIn the early days, humans were just completely at a disadvantage and\nthe humans wrote in assembly code. And this was kind of terrible. And\nwe’ve come some way since then, and so now instead of writing sort of\ninstruction-by-instruction that’s gonna be executed by the processor,\nwe can write in a high-level language and have a compiler translate\nthat high-level language to something that the computer can\nexecute. Hopefully along the way, it can actually make that\nfaster. But sometimes, we’ve gotten ourselves sort of too\nhigh-level. If we abstract away too many of the details of execution,\nit’s exactly as you were saying. It means that the programmer can no\nlonger do the performance engineering. And so, we need to expose just\nenough to the programmer so that now there’s some more details that\nthey can think about. Now they can do that performance engineering.\n\nBut still, I think the burden sits on the compiler to take those few\nhints that the programmer gives to make blazingly fast code come out\nthe other end. And it’s just really about this interplay between how\nmany details do we wanna expose? Certainly not all the details because\nthat’s too hard for the programmer. But we need to expose some. And\nso, it’s about, over time, programming languages developing more and\nmore features that sort of figure out the right line and the right\nbalance between this desire for high-level languages, closer to human\nthought, and low-level details, easier to execute.\n\nSo, before when we were talking about dependent types, we were talking\nabout how it’s important to have this kind of pay-as-you-go\nphenomenon, like, it gets harder as you try and get more power. It\nfeels like the same kind of thing shows up here.\n\nSo, when you try and get more control over the shape of data in the\nway that you described, what are the trade-offs? And how do you think\nabout designing the language in such a way that you don’t have\nwhatever extra complexity is there infect everything that you do?\n\nWell, we have to be really careful. So, with unboxed types, one of the\nchallenges is gonna be that unboxed types interfere with\npolymorphism. So, in a language like OCaml, you can write a function,\nsay, that computes the length of a list. And that’s gonna work over a\nlist, no matter what the list contains. And so the way that we say\nthat, is that in the type of the length function, there’s a type\nvariable. We say that it’s an ‘alpha list’ where alpha can stand for\nany type that you might wanna put in there. Once we introduce unboxed\ntypes, that no longer works out. Some of these types won’t be suitable\nreplacements for alpha. And so it means that, by having these unboxed\ntypes in the system, now this really powerful feature of polymorphism\nbecomes constrained. And so, algorithms that people are used to being\nable to use everywhere, no longer work so well.\n\nSo one of the challenges that we have is, how can we recover that? How\ncan we still keep this nice feature of polymorphism and without having\nunboxed types interfere? And so, one of the things that we’re thinking\nabout doing is some amount of essentially what could become runtime\ncode generation. It comes down to building experience with the\nfeature. As we start understanding this language feature better, we’re\ngoing to create programs using these unboxed types, recognize areas in\nwhich the current programming paradigms that we engage in no longer\nwork, and then figure out ways around them. It’s this give and take as\nwe’re doing the language design.\n\nAnd just to focus in on this code generation thing for a second, the\nbasic issue here is that the way you make in OCaml today, separate\ncompilation of work, and make the ability to write a function in one\nplace and use it polymorphically on lots of different types is, again,\nyou’re just kind of taking advantage of this rock stupid memory\nrepresentation. Like, what’s a list? A list is a collection of\nheap-allocated values, every one has, like, two slots. One is a place\nto put the data and the other is a place to have a pointer to the next\nthing on the list. And when you iterate over it, that thing always has\nthe same shape, it always has the same number of bytes, and so you\ncould just write one piece of code that kind of uniformly walks over\nit. And what happens in the unboxed types world is, suddenly you want\nthe system to contemplate multiple different possible shapes of the\ndata. And so, kind of at a mechanical level, you need different\nmachine instructions in order to do the walking of the data structure,\ndepending on what that structure is.\n\nAnd so, that’s how you might end up with wanting code generations. The\nway to kind of claw back the polymorphism is to generate the\ncode. Maybe you can generate the extra code at compile time, maybe you\nhave to generate the extra code at runtime. But you somehow now have\nto generate code for multiple different scenarios that essentially\nrepresent different physical shapes of the data.\n\nExactly. And right now, our best thought is that this will happen at\ncompile time, that we’ll be able to figure out what code we need to\ngenerate at compile time. That will prevent a few programming idioms\nthat someone might potentially want. I don’t think anyone will ever\nwant those (laughs) idioms in practice so I think we’ll be able to get\naway with it. But it does mean we’re thinking carefully about this\ndesign and it’s a hard thing. I’m not aware of another language that’s\nreally tackled the problem in the way that we expect to tackle it over\nthe next few months.\n\nSo another language I think is interesting to compare to, in all of\nthis, is Rust.\n\nSo Rust is a language which tries really hard to do two things at the\nsame time which are not trivial to do at the same time. One is to give\nstronger sense of type safety so that you can write programs that\nyou’re confident aren’t going to crash, so you get lots of protection\nfrom bugs from the type system. And also give the user a lot of\ncontrol over low-level details over how memory is managed. And we’re\nessentially trying to push OCaml in some sense at that high level of\ndescription in the same direction.\n\nHow do you think the Rust approach differs from the approach you see\nus trying to take with OCaml?\n\nThis is a good comparison. This takes us a little bit away from\nunboxed types and polymorphism because I think the way that that\nappears in Rust is quite different. But the notion of this sort of\nfiner level of control is definitely accurate. But Rust gives up\nsomething really big to do what they do. They give up garbage\ncollection. Within Jane Street and generally in programming, I think a\nlot of the time garbage collection is fantastic, right? It allows us\nto program without worrying about these low-level details that for\nmost programs, we don’t need to.\n\nSo, for instance, when I’m writing the OCaml compiler—which is written\nin OCaml, of course—I do want it to be performant, but I don’t really\ncare about microsecond latency. And so, I’m happy to write my compiler\nin a way that allocates a bunch of memory and then when it’s done with\nthat memory, the garbage collector comes and gets rid of it. This is\nreally, really convenient. In Rust, we don’t have that. In Rust, we\nare forced to think about memory, allocation, and deallocation at\nevery point in time. And this gives us this fine level of control, but\nit comes at a real cost, and it means now we’re sort of fighting\nagainst this ‘pay-as-you-go principle’ that we were talking about\nearlier. In Rust, for memory, you don’t pay as you go. Everyone has to\npay all the time for Rust fine memory control. So we wanna keep the\nhigh-level, garbage-collected OCaml for most applications, and then\nwhen we really want to have this fine level of control, we wanna have\nthat, too.\n\nAnd so, some of the work that we’re doing is around adding that finer\nlevel of control, but just where we need it.\n\nSo, one thing I wonder is whether this pay-as-you-go principle really\napplies in general or whether it’s like itself a kind of trade-off? I\nthink, if you’d asked the question of like, ‘well we should think of\ntypes in general as pay-as-you-go.’ Maybe your baseline should be by\ndefault untyped, and then when you want some extra control, you should\nadd types to it and lock it down more.\n\nThat seems in principle reasonable. But all the languages that I’ve\ndealt with that have pay-as-you-go types or what you might call\ngradual type systems, actually inherit quite a lot of complexity and\nproblems from that choice. It’s often simpler and better, at least for\nsome kinds of problems, to have a uniform approach where you sort of\nfigure out what trade-offs you wanna do and you kind of apply those\ntrade-offs uniformly. And I think, at least from my perspective, the\nbase choice you make in a language like Haskell or OCaml of like,\n‘actually, even though it has some ups and downs, we’re just going to\nhave types everywhere and that’s just how it’s gonna be,’ I think is\nat least a reasonable place in the trade off space of designs.\n\nAnd I wonder if the same is true about this kind of thing about\npay-as-you-go control? Whereas, I can imagine for some kinds of\napplications, you would want the property that, ‘yeah, I am explicit\nabout memory everywhere. I kind of have a hard guarantee that anywhere\nI look I have all of this extra information.’ I don’t know. How do you\nthink about this question of where pay-as-you-go is the right way or\nthe wrong way to think about designing something?\n\nI think that’s a great question and I agree. I mean, pay-as-you-go\ntypes, people have wanted that for some time. It hasn’t ever really\nhappened. And, I mean, you could almost say that C++ and C have\npay-as-you-go types and that they have type systems, but the type\nsystems are sort of completely broken.\n\n(laughs) Pay-as-you-go but then what do you get? I like that.\n\nWell, right, but, I mean, just to clarify for our listeners. What I\nmean by ‘completely broken’ is that at any point in time in C and C++\nyou can just say, ‘Oh, ignore the type system. And I’m gonna just take\nthis thing and change its type to be something else.’ And the\nlanguages, you know, they take this stance of, trust the programmer,\nthat when the programmer decides to do this, that this is a good\nidea. But we lose the guarantees that one would want from a type\nsystem like that when you dereference a pointer that there’s actually\nsomething there when you dereference it.\n\nSo, getting back to memory control, I like the idea of pay-as-you-go\nthere, or maybe it’s not even pay-as-you-go as much as a language that\ncan have multiple different modes of use with very easy interop. In\nthat we can have a system where there’s not fine memory management,\nthat you just sort of use the current OCaml’s system of uniform memory\nrepresentation, and then another part where maybe this particular team\nor this particular file says, ‘No, no. Here I really want careful\nmemory management.’ This is a different kind of pay-as-you-go. It’s\nsort of at the file level or something like that, or the package\nlevel, I suppose. And then as long as one piece of code can easily\ncall the other, that also works well.\n\nWe also see this kind of idea coming out in polyglot systems where we\nactually have multiple languages all calling one another because maybe\nthis part of the system is easier to write in some language, that part\nof the system is easier to write in some other language. It’s all a\nway of, these sort of different approaches to attack the same problem\nthat we don’t wanna have all of this complexity. We want to sort of\nnarrow down what complexity we have, where.\n\nRight. So there’s almost a notion of different dialects within the\nsame language?\n\nWith a really high quality FFI that really captures all of the\nimportant details so you can kind of interoperate, right? In fact, the\nwork of polyglot stories are actually really challenging to\nengineers. There’s like, a ton—\n\n… of hard work. I mean, we’ve done a bunch of work trying to get the\nPython-OCaml interop story working just right. We’ve made good\nprogress there but it’s actually quite challenging. And I feel like\nthe work is quadratic in the number of different (laughs) languages\nthat you need to hook together ‘cause it’s often unique, weird issues\nthat come with every pairing of things that you wanna make all one to\nthe other.\n\nI think that’s right. And that’s one of the appeals of having one\nlanguage that maybe is flexible enough to operate in multiple\ndifferent modes. So, in particular, in our design for unboxed types,\nwe are planning to make a box operation explicit. And the box\noperation is going to be ‘the spot’ that allocates memory. And so,\nnormally, you’ll be able to get uses of this box operation for\nfree. Programmers won’t ever notice it, they won’t write it. It just,\nall the existing code will have all the boxes inserted. But it would\nbe really easy to imagine some kind of compiler setting that turns\nthat feature off. Meaning that every time you wanna allocate memory,\nyou have to explicitly ask for it.\n\nSo this doesn’t bring you all the way to Rust, in that there’s still a\ngarbage collector operating, you still don’t have to manually\ndeallocate memory. But if I wanna write a program that absolutely,\nwhere every allocation is known, we haven’t designed this out. Maybe\nwe’re gonna go there, maybe we’re not gonna go there. Nothing is for\ncertain. But it turned out that in our design, it just naturally fell\nout that we could just add this compiler flag that just turns off\nboxing and it would be super easy to implement and we could experiment\nto see how easy it is to work with.\n\nSo, here we’re talking about a lot of very ambitious changes to\nOCaml. One uncomfortable fact about all of this is, like, we don’t own\nOCaml, we are not the (laughs) primary upstream developers. Every time\nwe wanna make a change to OCaml, there’s a bunch of people who we have\nto convince that it’s a good change. So one of the things that you’re\nthinking about in particular is, the kind of relationship of the work\nthat we’re doing here and our connection to the larger OCaml\ncommunity. Say a little bit more about how you think about this whole\nprocess.\n\nSo, I wanna start by pushing back against ‘unfortunate fact.’ I don’t\nsee that as an unfortunate fact at all. So OCaml was born as a\nresearch project out of Inria in France and still is there. That’s\nsort of its beating heart. And we are really significant benefactors\nof that work that others have done, that others continue to do. And\nso, Jane Street has chosen to work in part of this open source\nlanguage community where we’re taking others’ ideas and we’re\ncontributing our ideas back.\n\nSo in this podcast and in our work, we have these grand ideas. ‘Oh,\nwe’re gonna add this to OCaml. We’re gonna do this, we’re gonna do\nthat. Of course, what I really mean is, we’re going to experiment with\nthis idea internally. And then as that experiment unfolds, as we gain\nexperience and become more sure that it’s a right—I shouldn’t say a\nright idea. There’s many right ideas. But as we gain more confidence\nin a particular design, we can then work with the rest of the OCaml\ncommunity to try to make this part of everyone’s OCaml and not just\nJane Street’s.\n\nAnd in that way, we’re giving back to that community. At the same\ntime, we’re continuing to reap rewards from other work happening in\nthat community. So the biggest example of which is the multicore\nsupport that’s coming in OCaml 5. Still gonna be some time before Jane\nStreet’s ready to upgrade to OCaml 5. But that was a huge pile of work\ndone mostly outside, or maybe entirely outside of Jane Street’s walls,\nand we benefit by being part of this open source ecosystem. And so, I\nthink that this is a really great place to be where we’re\nparticipating, we’re getting new input of technical content, like\nmulticore OCaml, as well as design ideas. And I’m even thinking of\nsomething just a few weeks ago where I found an infelicity in the\ncompiler, made an improvement, pushed that upstream, and then we got\nfresh ideas from folks outside of Jane Street’s walls about, ‘Here’s\nactually an even better way to do it,’ and that was great. And then we\ncould incorporate that here. Without being part of this open source\necosystem, we wouldn’t have gotten that insight and we would be poorer\nfor it.\n\nSo, in the Haskell world, you spent a lot of time working on exciting\nnew type system features for Haskell and now you’re doing, in\nsubstance, similar kinds of work here. But I think that work flow is\npretty different, right? I think then, in the Haskell world, it was\nlike the primary work and ideation and evaluation was all deeply\nintegrated from the beginning in the open source world. And here,\nwe’re doing this work where we’re still open source, still, you know,\nyou can go look at the results on GitHub. But we are mostly iterating\ninternally, and then, over time, as we gain experience, as we gain\nmore confidence that the things we’ve built are good ideas, working to\nsee what subsets of these we can get upstreamed. I’m curious how that\nhas changed your feeling about the work, how it changes the texture of\nthe work that you do?\n\nSo working within the context of Jane Street gives us a lot more\nopportunity for experimentation. So a real big challenge of doing\nlanguage design is that, by necessity, you come up with an idea and\nmaybe you think it’s a good idea and you experiment with it on a few\nsmall programs on your own machine or you get your friend to sort of\nexperiment. You bounce the idea. Maybe, you know, you’re even\nproactive and you convene a committee of experts on this idea and now\nyou have, you know, five people thinking really hard about this one\nidea and trying to come up with the absolute best design.\n\nBut then, once you come up with the design, if you’re just in an open\nsource environment—without the context of a place like Jane Street—you\ndevelop the idea, implement it, and release it, and then now you have\nthousands or hundreds of thousands of programmers using it, and maybe\nit was a bad idea. But by the time you discover that it was a bad\nidea, it’s a little bit too late because maybe you have 90,000\nprogrammers who think it’s a bad idea, but you have a thousand who\nthink it’s a fantastic idea and will be very, very, very upset if you\nbreak their programs by changing it. And now you’re in a bad way.\n\nAnd even the people who think it’s a bad idea, who would like to get\nrid of it, don’t necessarily want you to break their programs in the\ninterim before they’ve (laughs) stopped relying on the feature.\n\nThat’s right. And so, it’s really, really hard to make changes to a\nproper open source programming language. In the context of Jane Street\non the other hand, it’s—I don’t wanna say dead easy. There’s work\ninvolved, but it is tractable and somewhat easy in that we can develop\nan idea, push it out there, get other programmers in the firm to start\nusing it, and then as that happens, we can say, ‘Mm. This isn’t quite\nworking out the way that we thought it would.’ That, you know, theory\nmeets reality, and theory loses.\n\nAnd so, then we can make a change to the feature and we have sort of\nan operation that we use internally called a ‘tree smash,’ where some\nJane Street engineers work together to come up with a big diff that\nhappens to all of Jane Street’s code, all at once, and we can change\nthe spelling of a keyword if we want to. And in fact, we’re imagining\nthis now. So Jane Street has been working on a feature called ‘local\ntypes’ or ‘stack allocation.’ These two things are kind of the same\nthing. And we’re realizing that one aspect of the design was just a\nbit wrong. And there’s already a ton of code written using the old\ndesign, but we’ve invented a new keyword and a new place for the\nkeyword to appear, and all this stuff.\n\nAnd so, it’s gonna be some work to fix it, but there’s no part of us\nthat’s saying, ‘Oh no. Now we need to think about a migration plan and\nwe need to make sure that no one is too unhappy with this.’ We’re just\ngonna go do it. And so, it means by the time we get to upstreaming,\neverything is battle-tested. And so, it just increases the level of\nconfidence in the design when we go through that process.\n\nOne of the concerns I could see people having about this kind of\nprocess is, it’s going to do a lot of training on, ‘What are the\nrequirements within Jane Street?’ But there are all sorts of ways in\nwhich you could imagine the requirements in Jane Street and outside of\nJane Street being different. I’m curious how you think about the\ndesign process in a way where you end up with language features that\nare likely to be of quite general utility, ‘cause I think, in the end,\nthe only ones you’re gonna get accepted upstream are the ones that\npeople think are more broadly useful than just being useful for us.\n\nSo that’s indeed a challenge, right? It’s a challenge of overfitting,\nright? We have a very particular style of code within Jane Street and\na very particular use case that we’re working on. I think that is sort\nof a harder question to answer in some sense. I think one way that we\naddress that is by seeking outside feedback from the very\nbeginning. So, the plan that we have for unboxed types, another Jane\nStreet engineer, Stephen Dolan, he made a presentation about this\ndesign for unboxed types, I think in 2019. We’ve been thinking about\nthis for a long time. The local types and stack allocation feature,\nthis has also been featured in a number of presentations that we’ve\nmade to the OCaml community, out in public.\n\nAnd so, by incorporating that process early, we can get broad\nfeedback. That’s not the kind of feedback that tells us, ‘Oh, should\nthe keyword go here, or should it go there?’ Right? That’s the kind of\nthing that we develop internally. But I think that, by giving these\npresentations, by involving the broader community, even from the very\nbeginning, that helps to prevent some of this overfitting problem.\n\nSo, another interesting aspect of your background is, you’ve spent a\nlot of time, years really, working in the Haskell community and\nworking on Haskell. And now, you’re working on a totally new\nprogramming language using it both as the surface language in which\nyou write your programs, and also helping to design that language. I’m\ncurious, what struck you about difference? I’m curious, what are the\ndifferences that have struck you about Haskell and OCaml at multiple\ndifferent levels?\n\nIt’s been really fun over the past, I guess, six months now being part\nof these two language communities. So, I should say, I’m still quite\nactive in the Haskell world. I have not left the Haskell world. I’m\nliving both Haskell and OCaml on a daily basis. So let me think of a\ncouple of interesting points of comparison.\n\nSo, one is, it seems kind of simple, but actually I think it affects\nthe way that we program. The approach toward interfaces. In Haskell,\nyou tend to write your type signatures sort of right next to the\nfunction and Haskell uses a lot of type signatures. OCaml doesn’t so\nmuch. And so, OCaml there’s these separate interface files where you\ndefine the interface to your whole module, but it’s kind of apart and\nit means, in my experience, looking at a bunch of OCaml code. OCaml\ncode tends to be rather less documented than similar Haskell code, and\nI think that’s in part because in Haskell, you put your types right\nthere and that’s a form of documentation. And once you put your types\nin, then you can also put more documentation there and it becomes part\nof the habit of the Haskell programmer to put those comments right in\nthere.\n\nA flip side of this, is that Haskell has this feature called\ntypeclasses. And typeclasses allow you to use essentially one\nfunctioning to mean a variety of different things. OCaml doesn’t have\nthat feature. And so, what that can mean sometimes is that Haskell\ncode can become quite a bit harder to understand because if you have a\nbunch of these function names, any of which can mean a variety of\ndifferent things, all strung together, then it takes a lot of work on\nthe part of the reader to try to understand what on earth is going on\nthere. And that problem just doesn’t arise in OCaml. OCaml is much\nmore explicit about what operations it’s taking.\n\nSo maybe I can even, taking these two examples, generalize that a\nlittle bit and say, I find Haskell to be somewhat more explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time. Whereas, OCaml is somewhat more\nexplicit about what’s happening at runtime. So another place where\nthat comes into play is that, the Haskell compiler—and this connects\nwith a topic we were talking about earlier—the Haskell compiler\noptimizes much more aggressively than the OCaml one does. And that’s\nbecause in Haskell, Haskell’s a lazy language which means that if you\nsay, ‘Let X equal some big computation,’ we’re not gonna compute the\nbig computation until we need the value of X. In OCaml, if you say,\n‘Let X equal a big computation,’ we just compute that thing right\naway.\n\nAnd so, that means, on the one hand you might say, ‘Oh, well maybe\nHaskell is more efficient,’ because maybe some code path never uses\nthe value of X and so it means that we can discard that whole big\nthing. But it also means that it’s much harder to predict in Haskell\nhow fast your program is going to run or what its performance\ncharacteristics are gonna be. In OCaml, it’s much easier to predict\nthat. You can just sort of read your file top to bottom and, within a\nfunction, it just performs the operations that you see roughly in the\norder that you see them. And that means, OCaml again is more explicit\nabout what happens at runtime, but without some of the type\nannotations that we see in Haskell, a little less explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time.\n\nYou mentioned a couple of things that are different that I wonder if\nthey’re really language differences, or just cultural differences. If\nyou look at the tendency to do fewer type annotations on the\ndefinition of functions, you could put more type annotations. And I\nthink there are some people who write OCaml who do, but there’s\ncertainly a tendency not to and I think the Jane Street house style\ncertainly is one that does not have lots of type annotations, outside\nof interface files where those are essentially required everywhere.\n\nAnd the documentation thing, too, like, the interface files are a very\nnatural place to put documentation and I am constantly dissatisfied\nthat I think we put way too little documentation in the (laughs)\nplaces that we could. And I don’t know that there’s anything exactly\nabout the language that forces that. Like, I’m not sure that I buy\n‘the need to put type annotations right on functions’ is the thing\nthat really makes that difference.\n\nThat may be true. It’s hard to say. I do think that form follows\nfunction, function follows form a little bit, in that, when you’re\nused to describing the specification of a thing right next to that\nthing, that, to me, is going to encourage you to write\ndocumentation. Whereas, in OCaml, you write the specification over\nthere, in that other file, nowhere near where you write your\nimplementation. And sometimes I think that means that you’re less\nlikely to put those comments on the implementation when you need them.\n\nIt’s funny. My intuition is the opposite of, like, ‘Oh, I’ve written\nthis very bare interface file that just has types,’ and I think\nempathetically about the person who’s reading it. It’s like, ‘How will\nthey have any idea what this means? I had better put a comment here.’\n(laughs)\n\nRight. So the comment and the interface files are good, but I think\nit’s not just that. I mean, and this could also be, I have a bias in\nthat, most of the OCaml that I’m reading and writing is in the OCaml\ncompiler itself. Maybe this is different than everything else at Jane\nStreet. In fact, I’m sure it is. And it has been striking for me after\nspending so many years working in Haskell’s compiler, that Haskell’s\ncompiler has many, many, many more comments than OCaml’s compiler\ndoes. Maybe I’m overfitting on this particular piece of software\ninstead of just the language in general.\n\nI do think looking at the innards of a compiler is always a weird\nplace to think about how one should write code for the\nlanguage. Because, like, one of the facts about OCaml—as it is often\nthe case for many languages—is that OCaml was written by people who\ndidn’t yet really know how to program in OCaml kind of by\ndefinition. And lots of the code that’s there now has been there for a\nlong time and you can sorta see that. I think if you went to those\nsame people today and been like, ‘How would you write this now?’\nThey’d all be like, ‘Oh, really very differently.’ But, you know,\nparts of it just kind of haven’t been rewritten and have the shape\nthat they did years ago and are harder to understand than kind of\nanyone would exactly like it to be today.\n\nAnd to be fair, that exact same thing is true in the Haskell\ncompiler. There are stretches of that that no one would write it that\nway today. But it was written that way before anyone really knew how\nto program in Haskell.\n\nSo another difference that’s always struck me about Haskell is the\ndifferent approach to language extensions. And I think about this in\ntwo different ways. One is, OCaml is just massively more\nconservative. There was a period in time early in OCaml’s development\nwhere you could almost see the process of Ph.D. students\ngraduating. It’s like someone graduates, they write some language\nfeature, and it gets added to the language. And that stopped pretty\nearly in OCaml. OCaml got pretty conservative about making changes. It\nwas like, ‘No, no, no, we’re gonna add things that are like, really\ngood, and it was pretty restrictive about what would go in. And\nthroughout that time, it kind of had one language, pretty much. OCaml\nworked in one particular way and that was kinda that.\n\nHaskell on the other hand, has had a lot of glorious experimentation\naround language features and those experimental language features were\noften hidden behind pragmas, right? There’s lots of different things\nyou could turn on and off. And so there kind of isn’t one Haskell or\ntwo Haskells, but there’s like 10,000 different Haskells, depending on\nwhich collection of flags you wanna turn on or turn off. You have 10\ndifferent pragmas and now you have two of the 10 different possible\narrangements of the language features. I’m curious how you think about\nthose different sets of choices?\n\nYeah. I mean, that’s a great question. So I do have to push back\nagainst your sense of scale. So Haskell has, when I last counted, and\nthis was a few years ago, 150 or so extensions. So Haskell has\nactually 2150 languages.\n\nOuch, indeed. So I think that this comes from the origin of Haskell\nversus the origin of OCaml so actually you probably know more about\nthe origin of OCaml than I do. But I know Haskell was started by\ncommittee. There was a committee that met starting in, I think, 1989\ninto 1990, coalescing these ideas around a lazy functional programming\nlanguage. And then this eventually became a Haskell standard and there\nwere multiple different compilers for Haskell that all implemented the\nsame standard Haskell. And then maybe one compiler would think, ‘Ooh,\nwouldn’t it be fun if we had X?’ And so, then they would add that\nfeature, but everyone still wanted to make sure that it was a Haskell\ncompiler and not this other special language based on Haskell\ncompilers. So there was an idea of language extension. So you could\nhave base Haskell plus these various extensions.\n\nSo, in other words, OCaml is like Python and Haskell is like Scheme?\n\nSure. Yes. In that OCaml has a manual for the language, but there is\nnot a standard. There are not multiple different software artifacts\nthat all compile some OCaml language that exists beyond a single\ncompiler. But, in any case, going back to Haskell, that was the early\ndays of Haskell and there were multiple Haskell compilers. As time has\ngone on, all of the other ones have either died off or there are still\na few other Haskell compilers out there, but there’s not really an\nattempt to stay current with the newest features. And there’s really\nnow just one: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, or GHC. And that’s the one\nthat, when I say that there’s 150 language extensions, the GHC is\nsupporting that.\n\nAnd so, when you have multiple different things, if you wanted to find\na common core that all of these different compilers can interop with,\nit makes a lot of sense to have individual extensions when you say\nyou’re deviating from this common core. Now there’s really just one\ncompiler.\n\nI think that the current system, the current plan at Haskell, is not\nvery well motivated. And instead, the feedback that I hear from users\nis that they find the whole language extension system very heavy and\nit means that, to get much done in Haskell, you need to now start your\nfile with the list of 20 extensions that you’re using. And newcomers\ncan’t tell the difference between brand new experimental extensions\nthat might change from one compiler to another, or extensions that\nhave been around for 20 years, or there are some extensions that have\nbeen around for 20 years but actually we know are dangerous and you\nreally shouldn’t use.\n\nAnd when I say, ‘We know,’ I mean, like, I know this and a couple of\nother Haskellers know this, but someone just picking up the language\nwon’t know that. And I personally find that quite problematic. And so,\nthere’s a debate going on right now within the GHC Steering Committee\nwho is a body chosen to sort of help evaluate the evolution of the\nlanguage to reimagine all of this. And I’m hoping that we end up with\na structure that looks quite different from what we have today, while\nstill retaining backward compatibility.\n\nSo if you have your 20 language extensions at the top of your file,\nthat will continue to work in this new vision. But I am hoping that we\ncan reorganize it in a way that’s a little bit more user-friendly.\n\nDo you think in the end it would make sense to move toward something\nwhere there’s closer to one standard language that includes most of\nthe extensions, and so that most users end up not thinking about that\n‘two to the whatever’ configuration space?\n\nI do think settling on one standard language would be good. I think we\ncan get 80% of the way there and go from 150 extensions to maybe seven\nor something like that. I don’t think we’ll be able to get all the way\nthere because there’s just too many different use cases for Haskell,\nthere’s too many different people who have slightly different ideas of\nwhat that core should be. So if we just sort of got rid of the\nextensions mechanism, I think that that would cause too much of a rift\nin the community and probably not be tenable. But we can get close.\n\nSo, throughout this conversation, I feel like there’s been a\nparticular kind of vision and idea of what programming is that’s\nmotivated a lot of your thinking. And that has something to do with\nhaving a language that’s simultaneously expressive, it lets you say\nwhat you wanna say, but also has real tools for reasoning, in both\ntype systems and, you know, more sophisticated mode-dependent types,\nor essentially automated tools for reasoning about your program. So in\nthe last, I don’t know, few months, couple of years, there’s been an\nenormous amount of motion in a totally different direction for making\nprogramming better, which is various AI-assisted ways of making\nprogramming easier. With all of this kind of recent work on large\nlanguage models, things like ChatGPT, Codex, all of that, making an\nenormous difference to how people are programming on a regular\nbasis. I’m curious how you think about this and how it fits into your\nbroader way of thinking about programming?\n\nI see this evolution of sort of AI-assisted programming as not quite\nthe sea change that maybe others have seen it to be. I see it as a big\nstep. It’s not a small step change. But it doesn’t remove the need to\ncommunicate precisely. In that, to me, the interesting thing about a\nprogramming language is that it’s a mode of communication that is\nprecise. In a sense, that’s almost the definition of what makes a\nprogramming language a programming language, as opposed to some other\nkind of language. There’s a precise semantics to everything that is\nsaid in that language. And that language is used as a medium of\ncommunication, both from human to computer. That’s how we often think\nof it. But also from human to human.\n\nWith the advent of AI-assisted programming, now we have sort of a new\nmethod of communication in that it’s a communication from computer\nback to human. In that, you might have something like ChatGPT\nproducing the code, but a human still has to read that code and make\nsure that it does what you think it does. And as a medium of precise\ncommunication, it’s still very important to have a programming\nlanguage that allows that communication to happen.\n\nAnd so, this new mode of communication is going to put different\npressures on language design than what we’ve had in the past. But I\ndon’t think it removes the need for programming language design. But\nlike I said, it does create different pressures and these have been\nevident for some time in that one little maxim I’ve had in my head for\nyears now about language design is that you wanna optimize for\nreading, not for writing. Code gets read much more often than it gets\nwritten.\n\nAnd so, when designing a new language feature, maybe you’re thinking,\n‘Okay, I could do this very cleverly with, like, a nicely placed\ntwiddle in this spot in the code. And I could use that twiddle to mean\nsomething very important about my program. And maybe that’s very\nconcise, but it’s hard to read, it’s hard to search for, it’s hard to\ntrain new people to understand. Instead, it tends to be better to\nwrite out words in your design and programming language, that’s easier\nto search for, and easier to learn, and just easier to organize in\nyour brain. If we end up getting to a mode where humans are doing even\nless and less writing, and computers are doing more and more of it,\nthen those pressures just increase. And we wanna make the language\neasier to read and maybe even harder to write. Maybe we even get to a\npoint where if computers are doing all of the code generation, it’s\njust kind of, you know, symbolic and structured. It’s not just text.\n\nSo we get these richer programming languages but I just don’t see it\nas, there was yesterday and then there’s tomorrow and it’s gonna be\ntotally different and let’s just start from scratch. I see this as\njust one phase in evolution of this precise communication medium.\n\nOne of the things that’s really striking about these AI assistants, at\nleast in their current form, is they’re really surprisingly powerful,\nright? They can really do a kind of stunningly good job of taking a\nquery and understanding it and providing a piece of code that tries to\ndo what it is that you asked for it to do.\n\nBut they’re also strikingly fallible. They make lots of mistakes. And,\nyeah, the reading thing is pretty important because you ask ChatGPT\nor, you know, whatever your favorite large language model is, to write\na piece of code and look at the result. And it’s super easy for the\nresult to just be wrong in all sorts of different ways. And I can sort\nof see the rising requirement of making things more readable. I’m\ncurious how you think things like dependent types fit into this story?\n\nSo, dependent types in their essence are a way of writing precise\nspecifications. So the sorting example that I gave earlier, I\ndescribed that, you know, you could have a function instead of going\nfrom ‘a list of ints to a list of ints’ to something more\nglorious. Well, before dependent types, or you know, language without\ndependent types, you could just do that in comments. But probably in\nyour comments, you’re not going to be as precise as you could be if\nyou really wrote it in types, right? You say, you know, return to the\ninput list in ascending order, or something like that. But what does\nthat really mean?\n\nWe need a language where we can precisely specify what this function\nis doing. So as I said earlier, ascending isn’t quite right. I mean,\nif you write in a comment, ‘This returns the input list in ascending\norder,’ well, what if the input list has duplicates? Now you can’t\neven meet that specification. Where actually, that specification\ndoesn’t make any sense at all because the input list isn’t in\nascending order. What does that mean to say to put the input list in\nascending order? That’s a contradiction in terms, because the input\nlist isn’t in ascending order.\n\nAnd so, there’s some amount of interpretation that humans can provide,\ninterpretation that a large language model can provide, but in the\nend, it’s gonna come down to precise communication and\nspecification. And so, where do dependent types fit in? Well, they can\nbecome the input to the large language model. Maybe now we have\nprogrammers who are well-versed in precise communication of\nspecifications, not implementations, and we can say, ‘ChatGPT, give me\na function of this type.’ And then you have your nice type that takes\nan input list, and it returns an output list that is a permutation of\nthe input list in non-decreasing order and we specify that.\n\nAnd then now, that gives a nice specification for ChatGPT to go off\nand say, ‘Okay, here’s an implementation that meets that. Oh, and by\nthe way, it has this asymptotic running time because I’m a nice large\nlanguage model and I’m gonna tell you that.’ And then, now we actually\nhave a model by which we can check that the result meets its\nspecification if it is in this precise language of dependent types.\n\nAlthough I have to say, I think I am more pessimistic about the idea\nof people actually going off and writing down the specifications\neven. ‘Cause those are actually pretty hard to write.\n\nI wonder if a more plausible model is, you go to your large language\nmodel and say, ‘Please write me a specification for a function that\nsorts a list.’ And then it, like, spits something out. And then you\nlook at it and think, yeah, that seems about right. And then you go\nfrom there to next stages. But the role that this kind of concise\nspecification has, it’s like a smaller and maybe more readable thing\nthat you can use as part of verifying whether the later pieces in fact\ndo what you think they’re supposed to do.\n\nYes, but I think there’s a real danger here. I agree with what you say\nin that, writing a precise specification is hard. And humans are\nlazy. So if it’s hard, we’re gonna ask the computer to do it. If we’re\nasking the computer to write the specification of the function that\nit’s going to write, now we’re getting into thin ice. Because if we’re\nworking in a system where the human is not expert enough to be able to\nread the specification and know that it’s the right specification, now\nwe’ve lost. Now the computer can just sort of go off and do whatever\nit wants and we have no way of knowing whether it’s right or wrong\nbecause we’ve lost that ability to sort of have that precise\ncommunication.\n\nI think one of the tricky things here is, people are often pretty bad\nat the reading part of this, right? The idea if something gets written\nand now you have to read it, especially if it wasn’t written in a\nreally clear way, reading some piece of code that is not really\nwell-structured is actually really challenging. Like, one of the\nactually most important parts of the process of code review I find, is\nnot so much that, like, one person writes the code and someone else\nreads it to validate that it’s done the right thing. It’s more like,\nsomebody writes the code and the other person says, ‘Oh, man. This is,\nlike, too messy for me to even read.’ And then there’s some kind of\nback and forth process where you try and get something that’s actually\nsimple enough to be understood. And I think it’s an interesting open\nquestion of, like, as we start using more of these AI assistants, how\ngood they will be at generating things that are actually simple.\n\nAlthough, if we have precise specifications, the simplicity of the\nimplementation becomes less important.\n\nThat’s fair. I mean, in some sense there’s a kind of open\ntechnological question of, like, how good will large language models\nbe, acting as tactics for theorem provers?\n\nRight. Yeah. I mean, but if we’re in an environment where there is a\ntight correspondence between the specification and the implementation,\nand what I mean by ‘tight correspondence’ is this dependent type’s\nmodel where you can—and there’s other models, it’s not just dependent\ntypes, there’s refinement types, there’s other ways of checking an\nimplementation against a specification. But if we’re in an environment\nwhere we can check an implementation against a specification, the\nspecification is simple enough and communicated precisely whether\nthat’s in very careful natural language or probably not just natural\nlanguage ‘cause natural language is very, very squishy. But probably\nin some specification language, you could call that specification\nlanguage ‘dependent types’ if you want or you could call it something\nelse. But if we can communicate that specification, check the\nimplementation against the specification, now suddenly there’s not all\nthat much incentive to ever read the implementation.\n\nRight. It becomes a little bit like, you know, reading the output of\nthe compiler.\n\nYeah. It’s interesting. I do wonder whether a whole potential kind of\ndirection for innovation here, which you more or less have pointed in\nthe direction of, is designing languages that work usefully in this\nkind of intermediate things to generate in the process of working with\nsome kind of AI assistant. The thing that’s generated as an\nintermedium really affects the overall process of working on the\nsystem and generating confidence it’s doing the right thing. It’s not\na totally new problem, I guess, in the context of language design. But\nit does put new kinds of pressure and maybe changes the trade-offs\nthat show up.\n\nYeah, that’s right. I mean, you know, it’s too early, I think, to\nstart to design a programming language around this kind of\ninteraction. We’ve only been having these interactions with these\nassistants for a few months. And they’re changing fast. So I think now\nwould be the wrong time. In two years, maybe one could start thinking\nabout designing a language from scratch to do this. That sounds\nplausible to me. But I think a good starting point would be languages\nthat we have now because they’re designed for precise\ncommunication. That’s, in the end, what we need. And, again, maybe\nthere’s less pressure on the writing piece and more pressure on the\nreading piece. But I don’t think that they’re so divorced from each\nother that it means that we throw out everything we have and start\nfrom scratch. That seems, to me, pretty unlikely.\n\nThat makes sense. Well, thanks so much for joining me. This has been a\nlot of fun.\n\nYou’ll find a complete transcript of the episode, along with links to\nsome of the things that we discussed at signalsandthreads.com.

At the same time, drinking on all three metrics has trended up among older Americans while holding fairly steady among middle-aged adults,\" according to a Gallup poll.\n\n62% of adults under age 35 say they drink, down from 72% two decades ago.\n\nConversely, drinking has increased among adults aged 55 and older.\n\nYoung adults are also drinking less frequently and are less likely to drink to excess.\n\nIn addition, distilleries continue to feel the effects of tariffs imposed during President Donald Trump’s administration, which have increased production costs and contributed to a sharp drop in U.S. whiskey exports to key markets like the EU.\n\n“We’re very worried about what tariffs could do to our industry,” said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers Association, reported WKYT.\n\nTake those two challenges together, and it's not surprising that American distilleries, including Artisan Distillery & Craft Bar, have decided to close their doors.\n\nThose impacts are already being felt.\n\nAmerican Whiskey exports to the EU, the U.S. spirits industry’s largest export market, have tumbled by 33% and cost $300 million since the EU’s 25% retaliatory tariff went into effect on June 22, 2018, according to a new report released by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States on the two-year anniversary.\n\nThe EU levied the destructive tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.\n\n“American distillers enjoyed two decades of unparalleled growth in the EU prior to the implementation of these retaliatory tariffs,” said Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). “This report makes clear that these tariffs took the wind out of the sails for American Whiskey exports to our top export market, which has resulted in a loss of more than a quarter of a billion dollars of sales.”\n\nArtisan Distillery & Craft Bar became famous for its Spike Vodka, a spirit made with nopal instead of the traditional fermented cereal grains or potatoes. Later, the distillery added gin, whisky, moonshine, and a tequila-like agave liquor and branched out to brewing beer.",

    "title": "My friend, who had no children or wife, died suddenly. His sister is contesting his will. Will she succeed?",
    "description": "“He did not intend to leave anything to his sister, his only living relative.”",
    "fullText": "A friend died suddenly six months ago. He had told my husband and me that he did not intend to leave anything to his sister, his only living relative. He has no spouse or children. Someone closer to the situation told us she is contesting the will. In the probate filing, which is in the public domain, she is listed as “interested person.” There is also a personal representative. They are represented by the same lawyer. That doesn’t seem right.\n\nMy friend, who had no children or wife, died suddenly. His sister is contesting his will. Will she succeed?\n\n‘It’s been a struggle getting payments from her’: I rent a house to our daughter. Do I just gift her the house?\n\nFor the first time in years, more homeowners have a 6% mortgage rate than a 3% one. That’s great news for frustrated buyers.\n\nThis 100-year-old stock-market indicator just flashed a buy signal. Here’s how investors should read it.\n\nTrying to Preserve My Friend’s Wishes\n\nYour friend’s sister and the “personal representative” — likely, the executor of the will who is representing your friend’s wishes as set out in his will — sharing the same lawyer would only amount to a conflict of interest for the attorney in question if the sister files a lawsuit to contest the will. If that happened, I assume the lawyer would decline to take the sister’s case.\n\nOnly someone with legal standing — an executor, heir, creditor or beneficiary, for example — can typically file a petition in a case such as this. A friend of the deceased, in most cases, has no standing to complain about attorney conflicts. Courts expect the client who is impacted, not a third party, to raise potential ethical issues.\n\nA conflict of interest would arise only if the sister formally contests the will or otherwise takes a position directly against the estate. The lawyer would be required to withdraw from representing one of the parties or, possibly, withdraw entirely. Until that happens, shared representation alone is not improper.\n\n“When an executor or administrator has a personal interest in the estate, such as being a beneficiary, it can create a conflict of interest that may make it difficult for them to act impartially,” says GP Schoemakers, a law firm based in Houston. Being an heir and a beneficiary does not alone mean an executor should be removed. However, mismanagement of the estate or failure to perform duties could be considered problematic.\n\nA will can generally be contested among these grounds: lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence from a family member, and improper execution. The latter is often the easiest and most common way a will is contested and/or overturned. A person will often state they intend to disinherit a child or a sibling, in this case or, alternatively, leave them a small amount, or they might say any person who attempts to contest the will should be automatically barred from inheriting.\n\nThere are statutes of limitations to contest a will. The sister will have to act swiftly and hire a trust-and-estates lawyer. In California, for example, those deadlines are particularly short and, experts say, rigorously enforced. A will contest must be filed by the later of 120 days after the will is admitted to probate or 60 days after the contestant is served with notice of the court order admitting the will. If the will has not yet been admitted to probate, your friend’s sister may raise objections, but once the probate order is entered, the statutory time limits take effect.\n\nAll that said, here’s the harsh truth: It’s extremely difficult to contest a will, and the burden of proof lies with your friend’s sister. Sometimes, these third parties hope to slow down the process and hope that the estate or rightful/legal heir will settle in order to move on. I’ve received many letters where the case seems stronger than the one you describe; one reader wrote to say her millionaire cousin’s nursing home coerced her into changing her will and selling her house. That looked to be a clear breach of ethics and fiduciary duty.\n\nLack of testamentary capacity is one relatively common reason that could make a will vulnerable to being challenged, and could also leave one open to undue influence, duress or fraud, at least in the eyes of the court. “Unlike other grounds for challenging a will, capacity disputes often involve deeply personal family dynamics, medical testimony and complex legal standards that can determine the outcome of an estate plan,” says the Casiano Law Firm, which has offices in San Diego.\n\nMany states also provide a surviving spouse with a minimum “elective” share — that is, the right to take a share of a deceased spouse’s property. This serves to avoid the complete disinheritance of a surviving spouse. Some people might try to circumvent a spouse’s elective-share rights by transferring property to an irrevocable trust, but they generally must survive a look-back period for such a maneuver to work. Obviously, that does not apply to your friend, as he died without a spouse.\n\nBut your friend’s sister has her work cut out for her — and her own lawyer’s fee to pay.\n\nPrevious columns by Quentin Fottrell:\n\n‘I’m in a financial mess’: My income was cut in half.

    "fullText": "Chiles head girls basketball coach Troy Hartmann was dismissed Jan. 8 after his arrest by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement the previous night after a basketball game at the school.\n\nHartmann is charged with obscene communication use of computer to seduce, solicit and lure a child, harmful explicit communication to a minor, obscene material distribution of information harmful to minors, and unlawful use of a two-way communication device, according to court records.\n\nDuring his first appearance in court at 11 a.m. Jan. 8, Leon Circuit Judge Stefanie M. Newlin ordered Hartmann not to have contact with minors and prohibited his use of the internet.\n\n\"The investigation began in November 2025 when agents with FDLE’s Tallahassee Regional Operations Center conducted an undercover operation aimed at targeting online predators. During the operation, Hartmann contacted an undercover FDLE agent who Hartmann believed to be a 15-year-old female. Hartmann’s charges are based on his communications with the agent acting in an undercover capacity,\" FDLE wrote in a statement released Jan. 8.\n\nThe investigation into Hartmann is still active.\n\n\"Now, he’ll be in court — not on the court,\" FDLE wrote in a post on social media that included a photo of him handcuffed outside a patrol vehicle and the school.\n\nIn an email to parents Thursday morning, Chiles Principal Joseph Burgess assured them that \"no Chiles or LCS students were involved in this matter.\"\n\nLeon County Schools spokesperson Chris Petley said Hartmann was not on the payroll or considered an employee of the district and instead was a \"volunteer coach.\"\n\n\"This morning the administration met with the student-athletes and notified their parents of the circumstances including the promotion of Coach Michael Quiggins as the Interim Chiles Head Girls Basketball Coach. Our young ladies will continue to compete and represent Chiles High School,\" Burgess wrote in the email.\n\nHartmann moved to Florida in 2014 and was the co-head coach with the Tallahassee City League. He began coaching at Chiles in 2021 and at the time told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter he was \"excited about getting the head coaching job. With my background and the staff I have, we can elevate the program.\"\n\nAccording to court records that were initially posted to the Leon County Clerk website before being removed for redaction, Hartmann used the social media platform, Kik, to reach out to a user in a \"Tally\" group chat.\n\n\"Hartmann is the owner of the Kik account 'big dirk,' which has been used repeatedly to engage in sexual conversations with minors,\" police reports say, noting he also used the alias \"Eric.\"\n\nThe user he reached out to was an undercover officer with \"2010\" in their username. Hartmann allegedly told the user he was 36 years old and assumed she was 15, the court records say.\n\nThe undercover officer told Hartmann they are currently enrolled in a local high school. After that Hartmann allegedly asked the user if she ever had sex before and expressed that he wanted to engage in sexual conduct, according to the records.\n\nIn another incident with a user said to be 15-years-old, Hartmann allegedly acknowledged the teen's age and proceeded to send her a picture of his genitals and engaged in sexual conversation with her, the court records state.\n\nAlaijah Brown covers children & families for the Tallahassee Democrat.

    "fullText": "A 550-pound black bear that had been living under an Altadena man’s home for more than a month has finally been removed, thanks to help from a wildlife rescue group.\n\n“I’m relieved – no more banging under the house and smelling him and wondering what’s going on under there,” Ken Johnson, the homeowner, told KTLA’s Jillian Smukler on Thursday.\n\nJohnson said the bear took up residence in the crawlspace beneath his home just before Thanksgiving, and repeated efforts to coax it out didn’t work.\n\nState wildlife officials tried to remove the bear using paintball guns, air horns and other tactics – but were unsuccessful. Johnson said the effort stalled after officials received instructions from Sacramento to pull back.\n\nAfter that, he threatened to sue the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for negligence and emotional distress.\n\nThe breakthrough, however, came when the BEAR League, a nonprofit based in Lake Tahoe, offered to help at no cost. The team, Johnson said, used similar methods to those employed by state agencies – paintball guns – but completed the job in about 10 minutes on Tuesday.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it was so fast,” Johnson said. “These guys went in, they crawled in behind him and, boom, he was out.”\n\nWhen the bear returned two nights later to climb back into the crawlspace, it encountered an electrified mat over the opening that gave it a small shock — so it took off. Only time will tell if it’s gone for good.\n\nJohnson described the removal as a “late Christmas gift.” He can now assess the damage the bear caused underneath his home, which includes a ruptured gas line.",

    "description": "\"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration believes you don't have the right to record Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in public. This stance is both factually wrong and an attempt to chill free speech by conflating it with violence.\n\nAt a July 2025 press conference in Tampa, Florida, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said, \"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations, encouraging other people to come and to throw things, rocks, bottles.\"\n\nIn September 2025, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin called \"videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online\" a form of doxing. She added, \"We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nThese aren't idle threats. The Trump administration strong-armed Apple into removing an app from its mobile store that tracked ICE activity and threatened criminal investigations into its creators.\n\nThe most aggressive application of this policy has come in Chicago under \"Operation Midway Blitz,\" where ICE officers have relentlessly targeted protesters, reporters, and clergy engaged in protected First Amendment activity.\n\nIn October, a group of journalists and protesters filed a lawsuit alleging \"a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians.\"\n\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs stated that federal officials' own testimony illustrated their point. For example, when ICE field director Russell Hott was asked if he agreed \"that it's unconstitutional to arrest people for being opposed to Midway Blitz,\" he answered \"No.\"\n\n\"Similarly, [U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Greg] Bovino testified that he has instructed his officers to arrest protesters who make hyperbolic comments in the heat of political demonstrations, even though such statements—which do not constitute true threats—are protected speech,\" the motion argued. (Hott and Bovino's depositions were filed under seal, and those comments were later redacted in a corrected filing by the lawsuit plaintiffs, but not before others took screenshots of them.)\n\nBased on voluminous evidence that feds in Chicago ignored her previous orders to curb their use of force, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction against DHS in early November 2025, saying the government's conduct \"shocked the conscience.\"\n\nEllis found much of the officials' testimony not credible. Bovino, for instance, testified that he never used force against a protester he was filmed tackling, and in another instance, Ellis said, he lied about being hit with a rock before firing tear gas at demonstrators. Nor did evidence support the government's claims that federal officers issued warnings before firing less-than-lethal projectiles at those protesters.\n\n\"Describing rapid response networks and neighborhood moms as professional agitators shows just how out of touch these agents are, and how extreme their views are,\" said Ellis.\n\nThe Trump administration responded by calling Ellis an \"activist judge,\" but it is squarely wrong when it comes to recording and protesting the police. Cato Institute senior fellow Walter Olson points out that, \"While the Supreme Court itself hasn't yet faced the issue squarely, the seven federal circuits that have done so…all agree that the First Amendment protects the right to record police performing their duties in public.\"\n\nLikewise, federal circuits have upheld the right to use vulgar language to oppose police without fear of retaliation, and to warn others of nearby police checkpoints or speed traps.\n\nAs Olson writes, the administration's \"attempt to alter reality by establishing new legal facts on the ground\" ultimately serves as a green light for informal repression. \"If the agents come to believe that they have blanket immunity [for] whatever they do, or that citizens have no right to record them, they are more likely to take aggressive informal action, such as grabbing phones or taking news reporters into custody on charges of obstruction (perhaps later quietly dropped).\"\n\nIt's not hard to find examples of this rotten agency culture in practice. In late October 2025, ICE officers broke out the window of a U.S. citizen's car and detained her for seven hours after she followed and photographed their unmarked vehicles. DHS accused her of reckless driving, attempting to block in officers with her car, and resisting arrest—all claims that she and her lawyer deny. Prosecutors did not charge the woman with a crime.\n\nRecording government agents is one of the few tools citizens have to hold state power accountable. Any attempt to redefine observation as \"violence\" is not only unconstitutional—it's authoritarian gaslighting. When a government fears cameras more than crimes, it isn't protecting the rule of law. It's protecting itself.\n\nThe post The Trump Administration Says It's Illegal To Record Videos of ICE. Here's What the Law Says. appeared first on Reason.com.",

He has long argued that affordability issues are shaped by multiple forces, including insurance costs, supply constraints and local regulation.\n\nNew report reveals US may have sold Bitcoin despite Trump exec order\n\nU.S. housing crisis sparks boom in crypto-backed mortgages\n\nVenezuela could hold as much Bitcoin as Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy\n\nWhen pressed on what unintended consequences might look like, Cuban said they are hard to predict in advance.\n\n“Meaning you can’t anticipate everything,” he said, adding “I don’t know what they could be.”\n\nHis answer highlights both the appeal and the risk of blunt policy tools.\n\nWhile restricting large buyers could ease competition in some markets, it does not address the deeper shortage of homes that economists say is the main driver of high prices.",

    "description": "The president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more in a revealing new interview",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said that his only guardrail as he looks to obtain more global power is \"my own morality\"\n\nIn a new interview with The New York Times, he said he doesn't \"need international law\" to dictate his approach to foreign policy\n\nAlso in the interview, the president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making it clear that he won't be constrained by the law as he continues teasing a takeover of the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I don’t need international law,” Trump said in a new interview with The New York Times. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”\n\nWhen pressed further, the president said he understood that his administration would need to abide by international laws. However, he added, \"It depends what your definition of international law is.\"\n\nThere is, Trump insisted, just \"one thing\" that can curtail his desire for global supremacy: \"My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.\"\n\nThe interview comes less than a week after U.S. forces, under Trump's direction, captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, first lady Cilia Flores, amid \"large-scale strikes\" on the capital city of Caracas, and brought them to the U.S. to stand trial on multiple charges related to narco terrorism.\n\nThough Venezuela has installed an interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump has stated many times that the United States is now in charge of running the independent nation.\n\n\"It's going to be run very judiciously, very fairly. And it's gonna make a lot of money,\" he previously said. \"You know they stole our oil. We built that whole industry and they just took it over like we were nothing. So we did something about it. We're late, but we did something about it.\"\n\nHe later added, \"We'll be selling large amounts of oil [from Venezuela] to other countries... We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"\n\n\"We're gonna make sure the people of Venezuela are taken care of... You're going to have peace, justice...you're going to have a real country.\"\n\nHe doesn't plan to stop there. The president is also fixated on his desire to annex Greenland, which is currently controlled by Denmark, a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nTrump admitted that \"it may be a choice\" to preserve the country's relationship with NATO versus taking over Greenland, an important trade crossroads between the U.S., Europe, China and Russia.\n\n“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” he said to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”\n\nTo The New York Times, he insisted that it wasn't enough to have the country controlled by an ally — he wants exclusive, outright ownership.\n\n“Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also has his sights set on Colombia, Cuba, Iran and Mexico.\n\n\"You have to do something with Mexico. Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something,\" he previously told reporters, referring to drug cartels in the country.\n\n\"We'd love Mexico to do it. They're capable of doing it, but unfortunately, the cartels are very strong in Mexico,\" Trump added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nReferring to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Trump said his country is being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long.\"\n\nPetro spoke with the Times prior to calling Trump to discuss the threats, expressing his concern about the U.S. making a strike in Colombia, similar to the one in Venezuela.\n\n“We are in danger,” the Colombian president said. “Because the threat is real. It was made by Trump.”",

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, January 8, 2026: A nudge higher for the week",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates, which are testing 6% lows. Shop multiple lenders and lock in your best mortgage rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates remain in the low 6% range. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate for the week is 6.16%, up one basis point. The 15-year fixed rate weekly average was 5.46%, up two basis points. For weeks, home loan interest rates have been making only fractional moves, but remember, mortgage rates vary by location, even by state.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate with not just banks, but also credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is a fantastic mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on what your financial goals are when refinancing, and when your break-even point would be after paying refinance closing costs.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nRefinancing your home loan can help you pay off other debt, especially if you qualify for a cash-out refinance.

    "title": "USMC XQ-58 Valkyrie Development Makes Leap Forward With New Contract (Updated)",
    "description": "Northrop Grumman has now joined the effort to craft a fully missionized version of Kratos' XQ-58 for the Marine Corps.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps’ pursuit of a fully missionized version of Kratos’ stealthy XQ-58A Valkyrie drone has taken another step forward with a new announcement that Northrop Grumman is now aiding in the effort. Northrop Grumman says it will deliver a “mission kit” that includes its Prism autonomy package, sensors, and other capabilities to help fully turn the Valkyrie into what looks set to be the Marines’ first operational Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA).\n\nNorthrop Grumman announced today it has received a competitively awarded deal in relation to what is formally known as the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Uncrewed Expeditionary Tactical Aircraft (MUX TACAIR) Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. U.S. officials confirmed last year that the Marine Corps was moving to transition its experimental work with the XQ-58 into a full program of record to develop and field an operational CCA-type drone. The Marines have acquired at least three Valkyries since 2023. The U.S. Air Force is the only other known current operator of the XQ-58 and has been using the type for test and evaluation work since its first flight in 2019.\n\nUnder the newly announced deal, “Northrop Grumman will develop and rapidly deliver platforms that include” the aforementioned mission kit, “inclusive of sensors and software-defined technologies designed specifically for uncrewed aircraft,” according to a company press release. “The mission kit’s flexible technology can perform various kinetic and non-kinetic effects, making the platform a combat-ready asset.”\n\n“Northrop Grumman’s open architecture autonomy software package – known as Prism – will manage the aircraft’s operations autonomously,” the release adds. The company has already been conducting flight testing involving Prism using the Model 437 Vanguard jet, now also referred to as Beacon, which was developed and built by its subsidiary Scaled Composites.\n\n“Northrop Grumman remains at the forefront of advanced sensing capabilities, delivering innovative solutions that meet the needs of the warfighter with unmatched speed and reliability,” Krys Moen, Vice President for Advanced Mission Capabilities, said in an accompanying statement. “This enhanced capability set ensures optimal performance for both crewed and uncrewed platforms.”\n\n“The integration of the Kratos Valkyrie aircraft system configured with the world’s best multifunction mission systems from Northrop Grumman results in a high-capability CCA at a price point that enables the uncrewed systems to be deployed in mass with crewed aircraft,” Steve Fendley, President of Kratos’ Unmanned Systems Division, also said in a statement included in the release.\n\nNorthrop Grumman’s press release also highlights Kratos’ work on a derivative of the XQ-58 with built-in landing gear. As originally designed, Valkyrie is fully runway independent and takes off via a rocket-assisted method from a static launcher. The drone is then recovered via parachute at the end of the sortie. Kratos has also developed a special trolley that allows versions without fixed landing gear to take off from traditional runways.\n\nNorthrop Grumman has separately told Breaking Defense that its MUX TACAIR CCA deal is valued at approximately $231.5 million and covers work over a period of 24 months, and that is a so-called Other Transactional Agreement (OTA). The U.S. military uses the OTA mechanism to support rapid prototyping and other research and development work without having to go through more traditional and often more drawn-out contracting processes.\n\nOfficial U.S. military budget documents released last year said that the Marines were looking to acquire at least one MUX TACAIR CCA prototype in a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) configuration. Kratos has referred to the fixed landing gear Valkyrie derivative as the CTOL version. However, whether that is the only configuration the Marines are eyeing now is unclear, and TWZ has reached out to Northrop Grumman, Kratos, and the Marine Corps \n\n“So we’re obviously, we’ve been doing a lot of development work for the Marines, a lot of integration of mission systems, a lot of ground and flight test of those mission systems,” Kratos’ Fendley had told TWZ on the show floor of the annual Modern Day Marine conference in Washington, D.C., last year. “And that’s continued to where we’re pretty close to having a couple final versions of the aircraft.”\n\nTWZ has previously highlighted the value a runway-independent version would bring to the Marine Corps, given the service’s current focus on future expeditionary and distributed operations. Flexibility to operate from traditional runways, which could offer benefits in terms of total payload capacity and maximum range, could still be desirable, as well.\n\nOverall, “the uncrewed weapons systems under development [as part of the MUX TACAIR program] will enhance Marine Corps Aviation’s lethality and ability to support the Stand-in Force (SiF) by delivering air-to-ground, reconnaissance, and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities,” per the aforementioned budget documents. “The Marine Corps will use a spiral approach for capability insertion into TACAIR. MUX TACAIR Increment I will rapidly accelerate the time between development and fielding, ensuring rapid and relevant capability delivery of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to the warfighter.”\n\nThere has also been explicit talk about pairing the XQ-58 with the Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, and flight tests to explore this kind of crewed-uncrewed teaming have been carried out in the past.\n\nOutside of work for the Marine Corps, beyond the aforementioned developments related to launching and recovering the Valkyrie, Kratos has been steadily working to expand the performance and other capabilities of the design. The company is separately working on a miniature cruise missile called Ragnarok, which the XQ-58 can carry in its internal bay and externally under its wings, and that you can read more about here. Renderings have also shown Valkyries with AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) under their wings. Northrop Grumman has put forward the uncrewed aircraft as a notional launch platform for its Lumberjack loitering one-way attack drone, as well.\n\nThe XQ-58 has a high degree of modularity baked in from the start. Kratos has long put heavy emphasis on open-architecture systems to make it easier to integrate new and improved capabilities and functionality down the line, as well.\n\nRegardless of the aircraft’s physical configuration, there are many other questions the Marine Corps will still need to answer before it can truly field an operational CCA force, something the service itself has been open about and that TWZ regularly highlights. Much remains to be settled about how CCA-type drones will be deployed, launched, recovered, supported, and otherwise operated on a day-to-day basis, let alone employed tactically in a real-world combat environment.\n\n“We still have a lot to learn simply to get this thing airborne, flying, and executing next to an F-35, and not hitting each other,” Col. Derek Brannon, director of the Marine Corps’ Cunningham Group, said at the Modern Day Marine exhibition last year. “I know there’s a lot of work out there, but that’s important to make sure that we become lethal.”\n\nThe Cunningham Group, which falls under the office of the Deputy Commandant for Aviation, is charged with plotting out the overall future course for Marine Corps aviation developments.\n\nThis all applies equally to the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy CCA programs. All three services are pursuing their efforts in very close cooperation, including in the development of common command and control architectures. By the Navy’s own admission, the Air Force and Marine Corps CCA programs are much more mature than its effort.\n\nJoining the Marine Corps MUX TACAIR program is an important development for Northrop Grumman as a company, which has been making other inroads in the growing CCA market space recently. In December, the Air Force announced that it had assigned a formal designation, YFQ-48A, to the Project Talon drone design developed by Northrop Grumman and its subsidiary Scaled Composites. The service also said at that time that the YFQ-48A, which had only been unveiled publicly earlier in the month, was a “strong contender” for inclusion in its CCA efforts. Project Talon leveraged lessons from Northrop Grumman’s losing entry in the competition for the first phase, or Increment 1, of the Air Force’s CCA program, as you can learn more about here. Last September, the Navy also confirmed that Northrop Grumman was among the companies it had awarded contracts to for the development of concepts for future carrier-based CCAs.\n\nProject Talon is here. This next-gen autonomous aircraft is made to adapt fast.\n\nBuilt for the challenges ahead pic.twitter.com/6UOhLSBHKn\n\n— Northrop Grumman (@northropgrumman) December 4, 2025\n\nThe Marine Corps moving to field an operational version of the Valkyrie has been significant for Kratos, as well. The company has been very actively pitching versions of the XQ-58 to other customers, including ones overseas. It is working now with Airbus to craft a version for the German armed forces. Kratos has also been seeing growing export success with other designs in its tactical drone portfolio.\n\nWhen it comes to the Marine Corps CCA plans, the service has said it hopes to take delivery of the first prototype before the end of this year, and Northrop Grumman has now joined Kratos in working to make that a reality.\n\nNorthrop Grumman has now provided additional details about how it is working together with Kratos in relation to the MUX TACAIR CCA effort, and about what the company will be contributing.\n\n“Northrop Grumman and Kratos teamed up to respond together to the Naval Aviation Systems Consortium Statement of Need Request for White Papers for USMC TACAIR Increment 1 (N00019-24-9-0021).  Northrop Grumman and Kratos have collaborated successfully together on multiple projects in prime and support roles including Valkyrie,” a company spokesperson explained to TWZ. “Due to the collaborative integration needed for this solution, the team jointly decided Northrop Grumman as Lead Systems Integrator and Kratos as airframe subcontractor provided the best approach for MUX TACAIR.”\n\n“The mission kit is a fully integrated sensor suite covering multiple functions and frequency bands,” they added. “Northrop Grumman is integrating both Northrop sensors and a variety of best of breed industry sensors into a low-cost integrated solution.”\n\n“Kratos is teamed with NGC for mission configured Valkyrie derivatives and is also a subcontractor on the MUX TACAIR contract providing Valkyrie aircraft, supporting development and testing including flight testing, and supporting integration of NGC mission systems for the ultimate Marines CCA product, which Kratos will manufacture in Oklahoma City,” a spokesperson for that company also separately told TWZ.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "fullText": "GUATIRE, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela released citizens and foreigners from its prisons on Thursday in what a top government official described as a gesture to “seek peace” less than a week after former President Nicolás Maduro was captured by U.S. forces to face federal drug-trafficking charges in New York.\n\nJorge Rodríguez, brother of acting President Delcy Rodríguez and head of the National Assembly, said a “significant number” of people would be freed, but he was not specific about how many or provide names.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have freed political prisoners before, but the releases on Thursday were the first since Maduro was deposed. Human rights groups were encouraged by the releases, though it wasn’t clear yet whether this might represent the early stages of a government in transition or was more of a symbolic effort to please the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro’s loyalists to stay in control even as it exerts political pressure through crippling sanctions.\n\nJournalists, lawyers and human rights activists were among those freed on Thursday, and families waited outside a notorious prison in hopes their loved ones would be among the detainees released.\n\n“Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,” Rodríguez said in an announcement publicized over TV.\n\nNGO: 863 detained for ‘political reasons’\n\nAlfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Caracas, praised Thursday’s release as “good news” that lifted Venezuelans’ hopes that all political detainees in the country may walk free.\n\nBut he stressed that he wanted this to become “the beginning of the dismantling of the repressive system” of Maduro’s government and not remain “a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others.”\n\nDespite a widespread crackdown during the tumultuous 2024 election – in which the government said it detained 2,000 people – Venezuela's government denies that there are “political prisoners” and accuses those detained of plotting to destabilize Maduro’s government.\n\nRomero's organization said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela “for political reasons.”\n\nThe Spanish government announced Thursday that five Spanish citizens were among those released in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.\n\nForeign Minister José Manuel Albares confirmed the group includes prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel. Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, he also confirmed that Spanish citizens Andrés Martínez, José María Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno were freed.\n\nBasoa and Martínez were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024, accused by officials of being involved in a plot to destabilize Maduro’s government as Spanish intelligence agents, allegations that Spanish authorities denied at the time. Spain’s El País newspaper reported Thursday that Gorbe had been living in Venezuela and was arrested in 2024, accused of being in the country illegally with an expired visa.\n\nA number of families of those detained rushed to wait outside of a number of Venezuelan prisons on Thursday, hoping to reunite with their loved ones.\n\nPedro Durán, 60, was among those hoping to wrap his arm around his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside a prison in the town of Guatire, around 25 miles (43 kilometers) outside of Caracas. Durán said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro’s government — an accusation the family fiercely denies.\n\nDurán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors that the government may be releasing a number of detainees on Wednesday and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.\n\n“I don’t have words to express the emotion I’m feeling,” Durán said. “We’re feeling a lot of hope ... We’re just waiting now.”\n\nDespite the anticipation, fear persists in parts of the South American country as residents brace for an uncertain future.\n\n“Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven’t done already,” he said.\n\nRonal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government periodically releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.\n\nIn July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for getting home more than 200 migrants deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where they were held in a prison built to hold alleged gang members.\n\n“The regime uses them (prisoners) like a bargaining chip,” he said, adding that he and other observers will be watching not just how many people the government releases, but also whether high-profile individuals are included or if they're being released under a condition of house arrest.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela’s petroleum worldwide.\n\nBoth moves reflect the administration’s determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the U.S. will “run” the country.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

First responders were called to the area after the crew of an outbound Metra train reported seeing a body along the tracks.\n\nParamedics pronounced the man dead at the scene. He was identified as 30-year-old Allen Chiquini of Mundelein, according to the coroner’s office.\n\nAn autopsy conducted Jan. 5 determined Chiquini died from blunt force head injuries consistent with being struck by a train.\n\nInvestigators said video evidence showed Chiquini had boarded an earlier northbound train, mistakenly believing it was traveling southbound. After being unable to open the passenger doors, he exited through the rear of the train by climbing over a safety barrier.\n\nThe coroner’s office said Chiquini either fell or attempted to step off the train while it was in motion. The incident occurred between the stop where he boarded and the next scheduled stop.\n\nToxicology results are pending, and the investigation remains ongoing by Metra police.\n\nThe information in this article was provided by the Lake County Coroner's Office.",

    "description": "Larry Page is leaving California ahead of the proposed billionaire's tax, and Jensen Huang is staying. It shows different appetites for risk.",
    "fullText": "It's a classic fight-or-flight response — with a billionaire's twist.\n\nA proposed wealth tax in California prompted the state's resident billionaires to consider whether they wanted to continue their residency if the one-time 5% tax is approved.\n\nTheir reactions, said CFP professional Don Hilario, who works with financial planning clients in California, boil down to risk tolerance.\n\nThe tax, as proposed, would only apply to assets in the state during the 2026 tax year. Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved assets out of California ahead of the January 1, 2026, deadline to avoid facing the tax, Business Insider first reported. Meanwhile, Nvidia's billionaire CEO Jensen Huang said he has \"not even thought about it once.\"\n\n\"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,\" Huang told Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow. \"I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\nHilario, whose financial planning clients include individuals in Big Tech, said that the lingering uncertainty of the tax can trigger a need for certainty and autonomy.\n\n\"People who want to have a greater sense of control will do the Larry Page route,\" he said, \"versus people who have the temperament to endure will take Jensen's route.\"\n\nHilario described a hypothetical scenario in which individuals with high net worths are considering purchasing a home. In a period where the economy and interest rates are uncertain, do you want to put the lion's share of your expenses toward the home in the event that rates will be higher in the future, or do you hold out and continue accumulating your wealth in the event that economic conditions improve?\n\n\"That's the same type of emotions that exist with this tax bill because the fear of not taking any action is unsettling,\" Hilario said.\n\nThe proposal, put forth by the union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West to offset potential budget cuts to healthcare and education, is far from being implemented — it would require 870,000 signatures to make it onto the November 2026 ballot.\n\nThe SEIU said in its proposal that the concentration of billionaire wealth in California makes the state \"uniquely positioned to address both the well-documented crisis of wealth inequality in the United States and the emerging and interrelated crises the state faces\" with the budget cuts.\n\nIn addition to Huang, Brin, and Page, other billionaires are voicing their opinions on the proposed wealth tax. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, wrote in a post on X that the proposal has \"massive flaws.\"\n\n\"Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,\" he said.\n\nAlex Spiro, an attorney who has previously represented billionaires, wrote in a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax were to become law. Hilario said that the significant uncertainty surrounding the proposal, including how assets will be valued and whether the tax would change over time, likely forced billionaires to decide how risk-averse they really are.\n\n\"I still think ultimately it's unclear. And I think when it's unclear, it'll make people, in this case, investors, be more cautious and defensive,\" Hilario said. \"And then a big part of it is, how do we respond emotionally? I think whether you're taking early action or enduring, you do want to gather information and avoid making a decision that would ultimately be irreversible.\"",

    "description": "As farmland prices fall in west Fresno County, one farmer bought property for its access to groundwater.",
    "fullText": "With farmland prices sagging and new irrigation rules coming, diversified farmer Michael Vander Dussen didn’t hesitate to spend $1.4 million for 321 acres in west Fresno County, as an insurance policy of sorts.\n\nVander Dussen admits he isn’t as interested in the land as much as its access to water. He recently planted a field of pistachio trees nearby, and he wants to make sure they survive.\n\n“What I want to do is preserve the ability to continue to irrigate those young trees,” Vander Dussen said. “So I will use some of that water.”\n\nThe state is in the process of implementing new water rules called the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. The goal is to protect groundwater supplies by preventing over-pumping. As part of that, groundwater sustainability agencies have been formed in the high and medium priority basins to ensure the plan is being followed.\n\nVander Dussen said both properties are in the same GSA, groundwater sustainability agency. And he intends to fallow a portion of the new property that is located west of Raisin City and south of Kerman. The farm used to grow Ruby Seedless grapes.\n\nThe Fresno Bee has started tracking these types of agriculture land sales using an AI tool that we developed to more efficiently share this news with you. Bee journalists use their reporting and writing skills to create the stories. The tool alerted us to Vander Dussen’s purchase.\n\nVander Dussen is the owner of Standard Cattle LLC, a company that specializes in raising dairy replacement heifers. But he also grows wheat, corn and hay. He’s added pistachios to his mix of crops, as a way to spread his risk.\n\n“Diversification is a necessity these days because of the ebb and flow of commodity prices,” he said. “It’s feast or famine sometimes.”\n\nHelping farmers like Vander Dussen expand their holdings is the declining value of farmland in parts of Fresno County. Farms with poor-performing crops and only groundwater wells for irrigation have seen the biggest drop in value.\n\nVander Dussen said the farm he recently purchased was valued at about $4,500 an acre. At the peak of California’s almond planting boom, that same land might have sold for $15,000 to $20,000 an acre.\n\n“This is the new norm right now,” Vander Dussen said.",

    "description": "According to an etiquette coach, you should never gossip with coworkers, poke fun at others, or bring up sensitive subjects in the office.",
    "fullText": "From spreading gossip to showing up late to meetings, employees often make subtle missteps when interacting with coworkers.\n\nAlthough many of these mistakes aren't meant to be rude, they can still affect a person's reputation at work. With more and more companies requiring workers to return to the office, it may be time for a refresher on workplace etiquette.\n\nThat's why Business Insider sat down with etiquette coach Mariah Grumet to learn about what to avoid when interacting with colleagues. Here's what she said.\n\nIn the moment, gossiping at work may seem like an opportunity to bond with coworkers. However, Grumet said it's ultimately not an appropriate way to connect with others.\n\n\"We develop close relationships with many coworkers, but there is still that boundary that needs to be respected,\" she told BI. \"It's inappropriate to spread any rumors about other people at the office.\"\n\n\"There are certain topics that should be reserved for places outside of work,\" Grumet told BI. \"We shouldn't be bringing up anything too personal, such as religion, politics, personal health concerns, appearance — anything like that that might be crossing over that boundary.\"\n\nIt's important to remember that some issues may be sensitive for others, and therefore, inappropriate in a professional setting.\n\n\"Even if you have a close relationship with someone at work, you still need to remain professional with your communication,\" Grumet said.\n\nIt's important to respect people's time — and that starts with punctuality.\n\nAccording to Grumet, being on time — whether you're attending a meeting or holding one — is respectful and shows that you care about your work.\n\n\"Being punctual is a representation of your professional image,\" Grumet said.\n\nGrumet said it's important to avoid poking fun at others, as you never know how a joke will be received.\n\n\"You can never be too careful with being respectful,\" she told BI.\n\nEven if humor is your preferred way to communicate, it's important to be cautious of what you joke about in front of coworkers.\n\nIn addition to what you do or say at work, it's also important to be mindful of your body language when interacting with others.\n\n\"Even more so than the words that we say or the tone that we use, people are paying such close attention to body language,\" Grumet said. \"When you are communicating with coworkers, you want to make sure that your body language is supporting your message and not taking away from it or creating a disconnect.\"\n\nAccording to Grumet, some examples of ways to be conscientious of body language in the workplace include leaning forward in meetings to demonstrate when you're listening or not having your arms crossed when someone is speaking to you.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 18, 2024, and most recently updated on January 8, 2025.",

    "description": "Ukraine's commander in chief said December was the first month that its drones \"neutralized\" roughly as many Russians as were called up.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's top general said that for the first time in the war, its drones are killing or seriously wounding Russia's soldiers as fast as it can get new troops into the field.\n\nDrones are the top battlefield threat, responsible for the most casualties in this war. Ukraine relies heavily on them, especially the cheap first-person-view drones, as solutions to its manpower and equipment shortages.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Tuesday in a Telegram post that December was the first month in which Ukraine's uncrewed systems units \"neutralized\" about as many Russian servicemen as it called up in a month.\n\nHe said video confirmed 33,000 Russian losses last month. \"The real losses of the occupiers are greater,\" the general said.\n\nSyrskyi did not provide a number for the number of Russian soldiers called up. Business Insider is unable to independently confirm Syrskyi's claims.\n\nRussia hasn't provided official casualty figures. As for the number of new Russian soldiers sent to Ukraine each month, a US assessment put the number around 30,000 last April. In May, however, the Russian president said that the number was twice that. A Ukrainian intelligence assessment in December said that Russia fulfilled its 2025 mobilization target of 403,000, an average of more than 36,000 a month.\n\nRussia's armed forces in Ukraine are a mixed bag of contract soldiers who volunteer for the fight — Russia attracts volunteers with various perks, like signing bonuses — conscripts pulled in through draft cycles, and other sources. Russia has previously recruited people out of its prisons.\n\nThough exact losses are unclear, Ukrainian and Western intel assessments point to substantial attrition. Russia has a much larger population to draw soldiers from than Ukraine, which is also said to have suffered significant losses in this war. Some estimates put Russian losses at 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWhile Russia has a larger population to pull from, it has tried to avoid repeated large-scale involuntary mobilizations.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin publicly promised not to send conscripts to the front lines, fearing fallout. It has limited what Russia can do with them, even though widespread reporting and captured conscripts say assurances have been misleading.\n\nSyrskyi called 2025 a great breakthrough for Ukraine's drone war and pledged that it would not stop, with plans to grow capabilities further in 2026.\n\nHe said that in December, the number of targets that were hit or destroyed by drones rose by 31% and that the number of Russian personnel hit rose by more than 25%.\n\nSyrskyi said in November that uncrewed systems were responsible for about 60 % of all enemy targets hit. That figure has also been higher, at times, in front-line areas.\n\nDrones directly attack troops and equipment — either by carrying explosives or dropping weapons like grenades — and they also collect intelligence that shapes how armies employ other forces. Even inexpensive drones have had an outsized impact, destroying sophisticated, multimillion-dollar systems such as tanks.\n\nRussia and Ukraine are locked in a drone development race to field greater numbers and more advanced drones, as well as counter-drone technology.\n\nSyrskyi warned that Russia also has ambitious plans for its drones. He said that Russia copied Ukraine by creating a separate part of the military for uncrewed systems and said that it has 80,000 servicemen. He said Russia plans to expand that to 165,500 this year and to almost 210,000 by 2030.\n\nThere are so many drones in the sky that Ukrainian soldiers previously told Business Insider that they were sometimes unable to tell which side any belonged to and would instead try to bring them all down just to be on the safe side.",

    "description": "Brick allows you to temporarily block chosen apps and notifications on your phone. You can only unblock the apps by tapping your phone on the gadget.",
    "fullText": "I'm unfortunately among the millions of people who have become hooked on TikTok, losing countless hours of productivity to 30-second clips of soup recipes I've yet to make, hair-growing products I've yet to buy, and gua sha tutorials I'll likely never try.\n\nTired of spending my one wild and precious life staring at a screen, I decided to make a change. And thanks to Brick, a $59 gadget designed to block phone apps, I've actually been able to follow through.\n\nAs my weekly screen time report became increasingly alarming, I attempted to fight back by setting a daily one-hour limit for Instagram and TikTok on my iPhone. When I realized the limit could be bypassed with the click of a button, the software was quickly rendered completely useless.\n\nThis same struggle is what led TJ Driver and Zach Nasgowitz to create Brick, which allows you to temporarily block chosen apps and their notifications via a physical device that comes in the form of a 3D printed, 2-inch by 2-inch square magnet. You can still access the apps you need throughout the day — like texts, photos, or Google Maps — but Brick makes it harder to give in to the temptation of a quick social media dopamine hit.\n\n\"With other solutions, the 'key' that re-enables distractions is always present,\" the Brick website explains. \"Brick allows you to leave that key behind, turning your phone into a new, distraction-free device until you return.\"\n\nSetting up Brick couldn't be simpler. After downloading the corresponding app and creating an account with my email, I activated my Brick by tapping the top of my phone on the lightweight square. A single Brick can be used with multiple iPhones — unlike your Netflix account, there's no limit — so my fiancé was able to connect his iPhone to it as well.\n\nI was then prompted to allow screen time access to Brick, which gives it the ability to block and unblock apps on the iPhone, and create my first \"Mode.\" You can create different modes to block different apps. I made one titled \"Get to work!\" and chose to block Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X.\n\nYou can activate these modes through the app or by physically tapping your phone on the square. However, you can only deactivate the block by tapping your phone against the Brick.\n\nThe very first day I used Brick, I was forced to come to terms with how hooked I'd become to social media. I caught myself unconsciously picking up my phone multiple times an hour to check Instagram or TikTok. It was a major wake-up call.\n\nSo I became diligent about tapping my phone to the little Brick every morning, leaving the square in my fiancé's office so I wouldn't be tempted. The effect was almost immediate.\n\nI was barely picking up my phone during work hours and feeling far less drained after each day, no doubt thanks in part to quieting the constant stream of notifications. Even when I wasn't using Brick on the weekends, I was checking TikTok and Instagram way less.\n\nI still have plenty of work to do when it comes to untethering myself from the grips of social media, but Brick is definitely helping.\n\nIn fact, I'm using it right now.",

Aside from a brief dollar increase in 2008 during the Great Recession, Costco has remained committed to keeping the chicken’s price steady despite ongoing inflation,\" according to Eat This, Not That.\n\nThe warehouse club actually loses money selling its popular chicken. But Rose Sioson, founder of Deliciously Rushed and an avid Costco shopper, thinks Costco more than makes up for it just by getting customers through the door for that value chicken.\n\n“Costco may technically lose money on each rotisserie chicken they sell, but trust me —they’re not losing when it comes to what I buy next,” Sioson told. “That chicken usually ends up in a cart with salad kits, ready-made mashed potatoes, a bottle of wine, maybe a dessert, and some random item I had zero intention of buying. It’s classic Costco strategy.”\n\nWhen a major retailer sells your core product as a loss leader, that's never great for business, but that's only one reason why Boston Market has been pushed to the edge of being fully out of existence.\n\nWhen I was a child growing up outside of Boston in the 1980s, my aunt used to visit, and she often brought a chicken from what was then known as Boston Chicken. At the time, the company was a small local chain that was actually founded in a Boston suburb.\n\nThis was the first time I had been exposed to rotisserie chicken, and the concept quickly took off. McDonald's was even an investor for a brief period.\n\nPeak footprint: Boston Market once had over 1,200 U.S. restaurants at its national height in the 1990s.\n The drop from 1,200 to 300 took place from the late '90s to 2023.\n\n2023-2024 decline: The chain shrank precipitously from 300 locations at the start of 2023 to fewer than 30 by early 2024, according to Restaurant Business Online.\n\nEarly 2025 footprint: Estimates indicate fewer than 20 locations remain open nationally in early 2025, with many stores disappearing without notice, a stark collapse from its former scale, added Flavor365.\n\nFluid numbers: Official company listings on websites and apps significantly overstate open stores; many listed units are confirmed closed, reported Restaurant Business Online.",

    "description": "Amazon rolls out an updated dashboard for managers to track office attendance and hours, expanding strict RTO policies.",
    "fullText": "What kind of badger are you? Amazon managers are about to find out.\n\nAmazon is equipping its managers with powerful new metrics to monitor their reports with a dashboard that tracks not only whether employees show up to the office, but also how many hours they spend there, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe move marks an escalation in the surveillance of white-collar workers at the e-commerce and cloud computing giant. Last year, Amazon implemented one of the industry's most stringent RTO mandates, requiring most employees to work from an office for five days a week. Now, managers have a way to spot — and potentially confront — employees who fall short of these expectations.\n\nThe updated dashboard, which began rolling out in December, allows managers and HR to view how often employees come into an office, how long they stay, and the locations where they work. It refreshes at 5 p.m. PT daily and tracks these metrics over a rolling eight-week period.\n\nThe system flags three kinds of employees: \"Low-Time Badgers,\" defined as employees whose weekly median time in the office is less than four hours per day, averaged over a rolling eight-week period; \"Zero Badgers,\" who don't badge into any Amazon building during that span; and \"Unassigned Building Badgers,\" who badge into a building other than the one they're assigned to over half the time.\n\n\"These metrics are intended to surface employees operating significantly outside documented in-office expectations,\" the document says.\n\n\"For more than a year now, we've provided tools like this for managers to help identify who on their team may need support in working from the office each day,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. \"We recently updated the dashboard to make it more consistent for all managers, but most of the data and functionality was previously available. We continue to see the benefits of having our teams working together, and we haven't changed our expectations for employees to be in the office.\"\n\nAmazon notes in the document that managers are expected to \"apply judgment\" when determining whether to initiate formal disciplinary follow-ups.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon began tracking and sharing individual office attendance records, reversing a previous policy that only tracked anonymized, aggregated attendance data.\n\nA year later, the company began cracking down on \"coffee badging\" by informing some teams that they needed to be in the office for a minimum of two to six hours to have their attendance count. The crackdown received criticism from some employees, including one who compared the move to being treated \"like high school students,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe updated dashboard standardizes these metrics across Amazon's entire corporate workforce, excluding workers such as warehouse staff and contractors. It grants managers direct, on-demand access to data that they would have previously had to request from HR, according to an Amazon employee familiar with the company's policies.\n\nAmazon is positioning the dashboard as a means to encourage in-person collaboration.\n\n\"Working In-office is important to our culture and is also about more than just being physically present during the week,\" the document said. \"Managers are expected to promote meaningful team collaboration through direct interactions with their team rather than just remotely monitoring badge swipes each week.\"\n\nAmazon is hardly alone in using badge data to police return-to-office rules.\n\nSamsung rolled out a manager-facing tool that shows \"days and time in building\" metrics, aimed at discouraging \"lunch/coffee badging.\" Dell informed hybrid staff that it will track on-site presence via badge swipes and could factor attendance into performance and compensation.\n\nBank of America issued warning notices to employees, informing some that continued noncompliance with its RTO policy could result in further disciplinary action. At JPMorgan, employees have described an internal dashboard that calculates the share of eligible days spent in the office and is visible to senior managers.\n\nIn the UK, PwC has said it would track employees' work locations to enforce its RTO policy.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Former Vice President Mike Pence has issued a dire warning that Donald Trump will be impeached if Democrats win this year’s midterm elections.\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s The Source with Kaitlan Collins, Pence said he agreed with Trump’s assessment that Democrats would find a “reason to impeach” should they retake control of the House, and possibly even the Senate, in November’s nationwide elections.\n\n“I think it’s very likely,” Pence said. “I mean, they impeached the president for a phone call when we were in office, and I expect it in this highly divided, partisan town.”\n\nPence’s relationship with Trump fell apart in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021. In the weeks leading up to the riot, Trump repeatedly and falsely suggested that Pence had the power to refuse to certify the 2020 election results.\n\nHe then blamed Pence for the certification of Joe Biden’s win, leading to supporters directing their ire at the outgoing vice president during the Capitol riot with chants to “hang Mike Pence!”\n\nTrump later became the first U.S. president in history to be impeached for a second time after being accused of inciting the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nTrump was first impeached in 2019 after allegedly threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, ahead of the 2020 election. Trump was acquitted by the Senate both times.\n\nDemocrats are widely predicted to post significant victories in November’s midterms. Historically, the party in power suffers heavy losses—particularly in the House—and Trump’s turbulent second term, marked by a struggling economy, is expected to fuel voter backlash.\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans on Tuesday, Trump issued a blunt warning about what could happen if the GOP loses control of the House.\n\n“You gotta win the midterms,” he said. “Because if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be—I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me. I’ll get impeached.”\n\nDuring his appearance on CNN’s The Source, Pence also suggested that Trump’s attack on Venezuela without congressional approval—and the unprecedented capture of its former leader, Nicolás Maduro—could become a liability for the remainder of Trump’s time in the White House.\n\nThe former vice president added that Americans are now longing for a “return to those timeless principles and values that really united the country.”\n\n“The year that Ronald Reagan won 49 states, they were the very same principles that President Trump and I governed on,” Pence said. “And whatever time I have left remaining in the public debate, I’m going to continue to be a consistent advocate for that broad, mainstream conservative agenda.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "description": "A virtually blank resume may spook employers, but job candidates don’t need a lengthy work career to land a gig—after all, one of Steven Bartlett’s best hires only had two lines on her CV.",
    "fullText": "Job-seekers may believe that an Ivy League degree or Fortune 500 work experience will land them a gig—but who they thank while walking into an interview could be more important than their educational pedigree.\n\nSteven Bartlett, the founder and host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, took a chance on an applicant with a virtually blank CV for that very reason.\n\n“I hired someone who’s CV was two lines. Their experience was zero,” Bartlett explained in a recent LinkedIn post. “Much of the reason why I gave her the job was because: She thanked the security guard by name on the way into the building.”\n\nShe continued to prove herself during the hiring process in seemingly small ways too—and those acts of humility got her the job, not her credentials.\n\n“When she didn’t know something, in the interview she said ‘I don’t know that yet, but here’s how I’d figure it out,’” Bartlett explained. “After the interview she went and self-taught herself the answer she didn’t know, and emailed it to me within hours.”\n\nThe founder took a chance on the experience-less candidate, and it didn’t take long to pay off; Bartlett said that six months later, she has proved herself as one of the best hires he’s ever made. “Fifteen years of hiring has taught me that culture fit and character is MUCH harder to hire than experience, skills or education.”\n\nBartlett’s hiring philosophy is music to the ears of entry-level Gen Zers kickstarting their careers without full-time work on their resumes.\n\nIt has long been the rule of thumb that the candidate with the best degree, most work experience, and impressive credentials will come out of job interview rounds victorious. But with years of successful and failed hires under their belt, bosses are bucking the status quo and chasing talent with human skills, work ethic, and integrity.\n\nDavid Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, isn’t drawn to candidates with the highest IQ. Instead, he said he’s in the “camp of smart enough” when hiring talent at the $282 billion company; in lieu of focusing on educational pedigree, he gravitates towards applicants who are in touch with “human elements” including the ability to connect, be resilient, and determined. Experience is also “hugely underrated” and a “big differentiator for the firm,” Solomon noted. Attending Harvard University or being the brightest in the room may be impressive, but it won’t get job candidates far at the banking titan.\n\n“You have to be smart enough, but the smartest person in the world without a whole package of other things [is] not going to navigate Goldman Sachs well, not going to be successful in Goldman Sachs over the long run,” Solomon revealed on Sequoia Capital’s Long Strange Trip podcast last year. “You can’t teach experience.”\n\nAnd Danny Meyer, the founder of global fast-casual chain Shake Shack, couldn’t agree more. To run the company’s 510 restaurant locations like a well-oiled machine, he needs talent to have a high “hospitality quotient” (HQ) over IQ. And he’s searching for six green flags in Shake Shack talent: integrity, optimism, intellectual curiosity, work ethic, empathy, and self-awareness.\n\n“I really don’t give a damn what your IQ is,” Meyer told Fortune’s Jason Del Rey at the Qualtrics X4 Summit last year. “What an IQ basically says is one’s aptitude for learning. What HQ is, is the degree to which someone is happier themselves when they provide happiness for someone else.”\n\nEven the Oracle of Omaha and longtime Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has fine-tuned his own hiring philosophy. After more than five decades helming the $1 trillion holding company, Buffett has witnessed professionals without glitzy Ivy League degrees succeed. And in planning his CEO succession last year, the investing mogul made one point clear: he wasn’t going to check the education section on candidates’ resumes.\n\n“I never look at where a candidate has gone to school. Never!” Buffett wrote in his 2025 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. “Of course, there are great managers who attended the most famous schools. But there are plenty such as Pete who may have benefited by attending a less prestigious institution or even not bothering to finish school.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

In that span, Paramount went through several corporate changes, from a ViacomCBS merger to the Paramount Skydance merger that closed in the summer of 2025.\n\n\"What we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message. \"But we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver.\"\n\nHou's Slack message was received warmly, with 118 \"care\" emojis, 67 classic \"red heart\" emojis, and 43 \"thank you\" emojis, among other signals of support as of early Thursday afternoon.\n\nSince Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison took over in early August, he's made several noteworthy moves, like landing UFC rights in the US and hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News.\n\nSeveral top executives have left the company as Ellison has taken control, including co-CEOs Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins, streaming head Tom Ryan, and international markets head Pam Kaufman.\n\nEllison is now focused on buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which has rejected its takeover offer eight times.\n\nParamount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead Hou's Slack message to colleagues announcing the move:\n\nAs Dane shared in his note, I'll be transitioning out of my role and leaving the company at the end of January. After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next.\n\nWhat we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy — but we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver. Yet again and again, this team showed grit, creativity, and passion. Whether you came from Pluto or another part of Streaming, the story is the same: we took on impossible problems and innovated our way through.\n\nThe culture we live — being curious about everything, feeling that hunger to solve problems, caring deeply for others, iterating constantly, and innovating in everything we do — belongs to all of you now. You should be proud of what you've achieved, and you should be confident that this is a team that can handle anything thrown its way.\n\nAs to the future, I have a lot of confidence in Dane and the vision and strategic pillars he's laid out for the year ahead. They set a strong foundation for where this organization can go over the next several years, and I'm excited to see what you all do together under his leadership.\n\nI plan to hold my last open office hours next Friday so anyone who wants to drop in, ask questions, or just say hello/goodbye has a space to do that together. In the meantime, if you'd like to stay in touch beyond my time here, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nServing alongside you has been one of the great privileges of my life, and I'll be proudly cheering you on as you write the next chapter together.",

The manager, which manages $22 billion, declined to comment.\n\nMacro hedge funds had a strong 2025 thanks to a choppy geopolitical environment caused by, among other things, President Donald Trump's tariff policies and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\nBridgewater Associates had its most profitable year ever, Business Insider previously reported, with gains of 33% in its flagship Pure Alpha fund. Rob Citrone's Discovery Capital was up more than 35%.\n\nRokos's former firm, Brevan Howard, lagged the macro pack, Business Insider reported. The firm's two largest funds, Master and Alpha Strategies, returned 0.8% and 8%, respectively.\n\nRokos, in a way, is a throwback to a previous iteration of the hedge fund industry, which was dominated by big star traders instead of the multistrategy managers that have come to rule the space.\n\nHe accounts for most of the risk-taking, Business Insider previously reported, and raised fees this past summer that give the firm a quarter of the trading profits generated.\n\nMacro funds are expected to have another strong year. Evanston Capital, an asset manager that invests in hedge funds, put out a report stating that the \"protectionism\" of the Trump administration and other nations \"will lead to more varied economic conditions across countries.\"\n\nBecause of this shift, there will be \"a richer set of prospective trades for skilled macro managers, especially those that can optimize trade expressions across directional, relative value, and volatility dimensions.\"",

    "description": "The USDA first published guidance in 1980, then a food pyramid in 1992 and a 2011 \"MyPlate\" version. Here's how they stack up to RFK's new pyramid.",
    "fullText": "For 46 years, the government has been trying to give us advice on how to eat better.\n\nIn 1980, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans were introduced, after lawmakers took notice of how some modern eating habits were fueling a rise in chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.\n\nThe very first guidelines looked like they were torn from a recipe book and were very basic principles.\n\nThe first guidelines didn't give people any visual aids for how to plan their daily diet, only prioritizing that people eat a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits and veggies, whole grains, dairy, meat, eggs, and beans.\n\n\"You need about 40 different nutrients to stay healthy,\" the guidelines said. \"Most foods contain more than one nutrient. Milk, for example, provides proteins, fats, sugars, riboflavin and other B-vitamins, vitamin A, calcium, and phosphorus — among other nutrients.\" But it doesn't have much iron or vitamin C. \"You should, therefore, eat a variety of foods to assure an adequate diet.\"\n\nIn 1992, 34 years ago, the US released its first food pyramid, giving people more specific guidance about how much to eat each day:\n\nHere, grains like bread, cereal, rice, and pasta were touted as the foundation of a balanced diet — the recommendation in the chart was six to 11 servings of grains per day.\n\nThe second priority, you were told, was to add in at least two to three servings of fruits and veggies each day.\n\nFinally, layer on top some protein from meat, eggs, beans, and nuts, as well as dairy.\n\nFat and sugar, which comprise more than a third of the typical American diet, were a side note.\n\nNutrition experts widely agree that six to 11 servings of bread per day is too much, crowding out space in your stomach for other important nutrients. Plus, they say, it's not just which food groups you eat, but the quality of each: whole grains are better than white bread, nuts and olive oil healthier fats than lard or bacon.\n\nDuring the first Obama administration, in 2011, the government introduced \"My Plate,\" which was meant to simplify our nutrition advice, but only added confusion, with four incredibly generic quadrants of a plate.\n\nThe portions of \"vegetables\" and \"grains\" were slightly larger than those of \"fruits\" and \"protein,\" and a glass of \"dairy\" was served on the side.\n\nCritics said this nutrition advice was oversimplified, with no mention of healthy versus unhealthy foods, no mention of portion sizes, and no room for diverse diets. After all, a \"grain\" could be a donut, or it could be some oatmeal.\n\nStill, nutritionists say a more specific version of this kind of \"plate method,\" trying to make roughly half of your plate vegetables and the other half a solid mix of carbs and protein, is a halfway decent diet strategy.\n\nThe Trump Administration released its 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans on Wednesday, a document that will guide federal nutrition policy for schoolchildren and military cafeterias, and also serves as a consumer's guide to healthier eating.\n\nThe big tagline this time is \"eat real food,\" a motto meant to encourage people to consume less ultra-processed foods, skip added sugar, and eat more whole foods.\n\n\"I agree entirely that we should eat real food,\" Professor Joan Sabaté, a nutrition expert who was one of the independent scientific advisors for the former 2020-2025 edition of the Dietary Guidelines, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Eat real food is an outstanding message. Yes. Reduce or eliminate highly processed foods, I think, is a good message. Reduce sugar is a good message,\" he said.\n\nSabaté is less thrilled with how the pyramid is designed to prominently favor red meat as the cornerstone of any healthy diet.\n\n\"Our eyes, when we have a document, or we have a screen in front of us, move from left to right and from top to bottom,\" he said. \"So the way this pyramid has been designed is that the first food that you see in the top left corner is beef.\"\n\nMeat can be part of a healthy diet, he said, but it shouldn't be so prominent.\n\n\"The scientific consensus is that plant-based diets are the healthiest diets as far as preventing chronic diseases. And there is no new evidence saying that animal-based diets are better for health and preventing diseases. There is no evidence of that,\" he said. \"People can also consume animal products, but they shouldn't be the majority of the energy on the plate.\"\n\n(The experts who helped draft these guidelines have disclosed ties to the beef and dairy industries.)\n\nOlive oil is a healthier fat than butter or beef tallow. Nuts are a great snack. Sabaté has concerns about kidney issues and cholesterol if people shun healthy carbs like oats, whole-grain bread, or quinoa, in favor of more meat and dairy.\n\n\"This pyramid, it prompts the American public to eat more animal products,\" he said.",

    "description": "Christopher Nolan's follow-up to \"Oppenheimer\" is an adaptation of Homer's epic \"The Odyssey,\" starring Matt Damon as Odysseus. Here's what we know.",
    "fullText": "After \"Oppenheimer\" was a critical and commercial hit, Christopher Nolan is adapting Homer's Greek epic poem \"The Odyssey\" for his next film.\n\nUniversal Pictures announced the movie in late 2024, saying it would be shot using \"brand new IMAX film technology\" and that it would arrive in theaters on July 17, 2026.\n\nHere's everything we know about the film so far.\n\nAyomikun Adekaiyero and Eve Crosbie previously contributed to this post.\n\nHomer is the attributed author of two ancient Greek poems that were composed in the 8th or 7th century BC, both of which tell the story of the Trojan War.\n\n\"The Iliad\" narrates the end of the war, while \"The Odyssey\" tells of Odysseus' 10-year struggle to return to his island home of Ithaca.\n\nDuring the journey, Odysseus and his crew fight against a man-eating cyclops, powerful giants, and sirens. They defeat witches and sea monsters, and anger the gods Zeus and Poseidon. But Odysseus has one god, Athena, on his side, trying to help him get home.\n\nMeanwhile, a band of suitors are trying to take over Odysseus' kingdom in Ithaca, supplanting his son Telemachus and convincing Penelope to marry one of them.\n\nIn a dramatic conclusion, Odysseus disguises himself as a beggar and sneaks back onto the island, where he observes the actions of the suitors before reclaiming his family and kingdom.\n\nThis will be Nolan's first film about Greek mythology, breaking away from his regular sci-fi and war films. Nolan also wrote the script.\n\nNolan's \"The Odyssey\" was partially filmed on the island of Favignana near Sicily, Variety reported.\n\nKnown in ancient times as Aegusa, or \"goat island,\" it's thought to be the inspiration for the fantastical island where Odysseus lands with his crew and stops to rest, barbecue goats, and drink wine before his run-in with the Cyclops.\n\nPer Variety, the scenes shot in Sicily are said to take up the bulk of the mythical action in the movie, while locations in the UK and Morocco are also being used.\n\nProduction wrapped in early August 2025.\n\nThat feat had previously been impossible because the cameras are extremely noisy.\n\nNolan, who has always loved shooting on IMAX, challenged the company to come up with a quieter camera. Damon told the \"New Heights\" podcast in January what it was like working with the new camera.\n\n\"IMAX cameras are really loud. It sounds like a blender, like a Cuisinart in your face when the camera's close to you,\" Damon told hosts Jason and Travis Kelce. So there's never been these dialogue [scenes in IMAX]. We couldn't have this conversation with a normal IMAX camera because you wouldn't be able to hear us.\"\n\n\"They built this giant thing around the IMAX for those dialogue scenes and a system of mirrors so your eye line would be close to the camera and you could talk to the other actor,\" Damon continued. \"The amount of work that went into figuring out how to do [that], because he wanted to do 100 percent IMAX, and he did it!\"\n\nSeveral filmmakers have brought Homer's work to screen over the years, including the Oscar-winning Coen brothers and Oscar-nominated German director Wolfgang Petersen.\n\nPetersen's \"Troy,\" which premiered in 2004 and starred Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom, was based on Homer's \"The Illiad.\" It was the most commercially successful Homer adaptation, grossing $497 million worldwide. However, it received mixed reviews, with some criticizing it for not translating Homer's story well. The film holds a 53% Tomatometer rating on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nPitt told The New York Times Magazine in 2019 that he was \"disappointed\" by the film, and the experience made him pivot toward \"quality stories\" for the rest of his career.\n\nThe Coen Brothers' \"O Brother, Where Are Thou?\" and the 2004 \"The Spongebob Squarepants Movie\" are two other Hollywood that are movies loosely based on \"The Odyssey.\"\n\nHomer's work has also been adapted into multiple TV series, including 1997's \"The Odyssey,\" which starred Christopher Lee and Vanessa Williams.\n\nThe most recent adaptation was \"The Return,\" directed by Italian filmmaker Uberto Pasolini and starring Ralph Fiennes as Odysseus. The film, which is a retelling of the final sections of the epic poem, received positive reviews from critics but made less than $1 million worldwide.",

    "description": "The LLC moved as California's ultrarich weigh leaving ahead of a proposed tax on billionaires that would take effect retroactively starting January 1.",
    "fullText": "An entity tied to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page moved out of California at the end of 2025, beating the deadline on a proposed wealth tax of the state's rich and powerful.\n\nT-Rex LLC, formed in 2006 and linked to Brin and Page, converted out of California into a Delaware LLC called T-Rex Holdings on December 24, 2025, according to a California filing reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior filings over the past 20 years listed Brin and Page as managers of the LLC at a Palo Alto address. In the conversion filing, T-Rex Holdings listed an address in Reno, Nevada, as its principal office, with Brin and Page both remaining managers.\n\nRepresentatives for Brin and Page didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes as California's wealthiest residents are weighing whether to leave the state. A proposed ballot measure would make the roughly 200 California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion pay a one-time 5% tax. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. The measure attempts to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nEarlier this week, Business Insider first reported that Page severed ties with California in late December by converting his family office out of the state and incorporating it in Delaware. He has also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures.\n\nIt's unclear what the entity tied to Brin and Page does. The filing describes T-Rex Holdings as a \"management company.\" Like other ultrawealthy executives, Brin and Page have used LLCs as flexible vehicles to hold assets or manage investments, often with little public disclosure. The LLC's name may be a reference to Stan, a bronze T. rex statue that presides over Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nBrin, who cofounded Google with Page in 1998, is associated with several other entities in California, including the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and Bayshore Global Management, which acts as his family office. Filings do not show any other entity associated with Brin leaving California.\n\nPage and Brin are, respectively, the second and fourth-richest people on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Each has a net worth exceeding $250 billion.\n\nAfter stepping back from executive roles in 2019, the two have taken differing paths. Brin has returned to hands-on work at Google. Page is a controlling shareholder, but has remained outside the company's daily operations.\n\nIf the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November. If approved by voters, it will apply retroactively to the beginning of the year, meaning those who wish to avoid the tax would need to have been out of the state by the end of December 2025.\n\nCalifornia law determines residency based a variety of factors, including time spent in California and any substantial business dealings.\n\nA December 11 letter from celebrity attorney Alex Spiro to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, seen by Business Insider, urged the governor to stop the proposed tax: \"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"",

    "title": "What Trump's plan to ban defense dividends and raise the military budget could mean for your portfolio",
    "description": "Defense stocks pay relatively high dividends, but there are alternative areas of the market for investors to consider if they want steady income.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump sent defense stocks on a roller coaster ride this week, and his recent executive orders on defense firms and his calls for more defense spending could impact investors' portfolios.\n\nThe president signed an order aimed at restricting some financial behavior among defense contractors, including an executive order that bans defense firms from issuing dividend payments and doing stock buybacks until they deliver a \"superior product.\" Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that he wants the US military budget could raised to a record $1.5 trillion next year.\n\nBoth developments have implications for investors who have money in the defense sector, which is known for paying relatively high dividends. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has an annual dividend yield of around 2%, compared to about 1% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere's the rundown of how investors should be thinking about the latest news — and what it means for their portfolios.\n\nFor the most part, investors shouldn't be thinking about their long-term investments too differently. Trump's push to ban dividend payments seems largely hypothetical, and it's unclear how the president will enforce such a rule, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"It feels as though this was making another random social media announcement that will likely die on the vine,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I don't know you need to make a rush to judgment in terms of changing your long-term investment plans.\"\n\nBesides the threat of barring dividend payments, Trump's announcements on social media seem largely positive for defense investors, José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. He added that those who aren't dependent on dividend payments should remain invested in the sector, pointing to the potential for growth.\n\n\"I think that investors can look forward to improved quality from those companies, in the best-case scenario,\" he told BI.\n\nIf defense companies fall in line and pause dividend payments, that could hurt investors who specifically hold dividend-paying stocks for regular income, Torres said.\n\nBut those investors can move to other dividend-paying areas of the market. Torres encouraged investors to consider value sectors with high dividend yields, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nB. Riley's Hogan encouraged investors to consider areas like energy, consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and other parts of the industrial sector, a broader umbrella that covers defense stocks.\n\nDividend ETFs, which track a basket of dividend-paying companies, are also an option for investors chasing dividends, he added.\n\n\"There's a lot of dividend darlings for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I think investors, if in fact they feel nervous about the potential for dividend cuts or the removal of dividends in any space, as unlikely as that prospect seems, there are ways to navigate around that.\"\n\nInvestors should be watching their bond investments, Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said.\n\nBerezin said that the significant increase in defense spending could lead to a rise in bond yields, which would mean bond prices could fall.\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also said he believed bond investors should \"absolutely\" be concerned about the more robust military budget, which could raise long-end bond yields in particular.\n\nLong-end bond yields have climbed in recent years as concerns have risen about the US deficit and rising levels of government debt. Higher debt levels make investors more wary of purchasing long-term US Treasurys, which means yields need to rise to attract investors. Heavy borrowing and spending are also inflationary, which could push yields higher down the road as the central bank adjusts monetary policy to keep prices under control.\n\nTorres didn't recommend selling bonds at the moment. He believes concerns around debt have caused long-end bond yields in the US to be \"too high,\" and he expects those yields to ease soon.\n\n\"I'm a bond bull at this juncture,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump took aim at defense contractors on Wednesday in an executive order.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is targeting the bank accounts of defense contractor CEOs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order outlining new rules for defense contractors that would ban stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget\" — as well as limit executive compensation.\n\nThe order stipulates that in future contracts, if the Secretary of War were unsatisfied with a company's performance, executive base salaries would be capped at current levels. Future contracts would also ensure compensation \"not be tied to short-term financial metrics\" and instead be \"linked to an on-time delivery, increased production, and all necessary facilitation of investments and operating improvements.\"\n\nThe goal, per the executive order, is to increase the speed of innovation at defense companies, rather than focus on corporate profits.\n\nTrump also took aim at the leaders of defense contractors in a series of posts on Truth Social on Wednesday.\n\n\"Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military,\" Trump wrote. \"Salaries, Stock Options, and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives.\"\n\nHe proposed that no executive should earn \"in excess of $5 million\" until their production speed and maintenance improve, though the executive order did not cap pay at that exact amount.\n\nThe leaders of the big five defense contractors — Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly known as Raytheon), Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics — each earned more than $18 million in total compensation in 2024, the most recent year for which data is available. Their total income was a combination of salary, incentives, stock options, and other forms of compensation, including the value of security services and changes in the value of pension funds.\n\nWhile exceeding the $5 million cap proposed by Trump by magnitudes, the CEOs' compensation pales in comparison to that of some other business leaders.\n\nDozens of CEOs earned more than them in 2024. James Robert Anderson, who runs materials manufacturer Coherent, had a pay package of more than $100 million last year. The CEOs of Starbucks, GE, and Microsoft each made more than $75 million.\n\nExecutive pay and stock transactions are part of Trump's larger plans for the military. On Wednesday evening, he said on Truth Social that America's military budget should be increased to $1.5 trillion in 2027, up from the record 2026 defense budget of $901 billion.\n\nThat sent defense stocks climbing on Thursday morning, gaining back what they'd lost following the signing of the executive order.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider regarding the order, a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin said the company \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nBoeing and General Dynamics declined to comment, and Northrop Grumman and RTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

It's free to call other Tin Can users (or you can pay $10 a month to call outside lines, similar to VoIP), which is what makes the service so popular with parents: They can create a sort of Tin Can closed circuit.\n\nFor Maria Pahuja, a parent in Richmond, Virginia, everything was working fine when she installed the Tin Can phone on Christmas Eve morning. \"It worked great, the kids were using it,\" she said. \"Then, Christmas morning, it stopped working.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you'd pick it up, and there would be a dial tone, you would call, and nothing would happen. Once in a while, a call would go through, and then two minutes later another call wouldn't,\" she said. \"It wasn't consistent.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Conz Preti bought a Tin Can for her kids in the fall and is a big fan of it. She was delighted how, on a recent snow day, her kids used it to organize playdates for sledding — all on their own, without the parents having to act as social secretary.\n\n(Full disclosure: I have also ordered one for my own kids. In a nod to what the company said is a paced timeline to make sure it can catch up with any tech issues, mine isn't scheduled to arrive until February.)\n\nThe concept of the Tin Can is appealing to parents like Conz and me, who have kids too young for cellphones but are old enough to want to communicate with friends on their own. Although it's similar to an actual landline, it's not one: Tin Can works on WiFi. Parents can set it to make and receive calls only to and from approved contacts. And it can also be programmed to have a time limit and be silent during quiet hours.\n\nThe company was founded by Kittleson, Max Blumen, and Graeme Davies based on a desire to create something for their own kids. They raised $3.5 million in funding for the company from investors, including Pioneer Square Ventures, Newfund Capital, Mother Ventures, and Solid Foundation. Since December 2025, they have raised an additional $12 million from Greylock Partners, bringing the total to $15.5 million, the company said.\n\nIn late August 2025, Kittleson told Business Insider they had sold \"tens of thousands\" of the devices so far. The company didn't have an updated sales figure to share.\n\nEven the disappointment of the tech issues with the phone is a teaching moment, one parent said.\n\n\"Part of what we're trying to teach kids is patience and accountability,\" said Joy Engel, a parent of a 5- and 8-year-old who lives outside Portland, Maine. She received the Tin Can she ordered over the summer on the first day of Hannukkah, and her kids have loved it, even with the service outages in late December.\n\n\"The company has been so forthright in what they say and how they've communicated and stopped charging people. That's accountability,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a patience there that you're teaching them that you can't always get what you want right now. ''Your friend's not there, that stinks. You're gonna have to wait and call them back. The phone doesn't work. That stinks. You're going to have to wait and try again,\" she said.\n\nFor now, the Tin Can is backordered until April. Not because of manufacturing constraints, Kittleson told Business Insider, but to pace the onboarding of the service.\n\nUpdate: January 8, 2026 — Tin Can in December raised an additional $12 million, to bring its total fundraise to $15.5 million, the company said",

    "description": "DramaBox, a top micro-drama app, is looking to raise fresh funding as the short-video format gains popularity.",
    "fullText": "The battle to become the top micro-drama app in the US is heating up.\n\nDramaBox, one of the leading producers of the short-video format filled with soapy tropes, has been seeking fresh funding from US backers, according to two people with direct knowledge of its efforts.\n\nOne said DramaBox's fundraising goal was $100 million with a $500 million valuation.\n\nDramaBox is part of Singapore-based StoryMatrix, and is behind titles like \"A Deal with the Hockey Captain\" and \"The Lost Heir: A Christmas Reckoning\" that it monetizes through one-off payments, subscriptions (usually $20 a week), and ads.\n\nDramaBox did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nExecutives at DramaBox told Business Insider in September that the company was profitable and that their ambition was to become the most popular micro-drama platform for Americans. They aimed to do so by working with Hollywood filmmakers and diversifying into new storytelling styles and genres, such as series for families and choose-your-own-adventure-style dramas.\n\nIndustry reports regularly list DramaBox as one of the top two micro-drama apps, alongside fellow Asian import ReelShort. Analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated that DramaBox generated $120 million in global in-app revenue in the first quarter of 2025, just behind ReelShort's $130 million. DramaBox countered in the September interview that its numbers were higher, without sharing specifics.\n\nThe streaming consulting firm Owl & Co. estimated that the format had generated $1.3 billion in the US in 2025, mostly from direct payments from viewers.\n\nDramaBox already has a connection to Hollywood's most blue-chip company, Disney, which has invested in DramaBox through its selective accelerator program. Disney said in late 2025 that it was in talks with DramaBox to adapt young adult fantasy novels into original micro dramas and was exploring adapting music albums into vertical short videos.\n\nInvestors have been placing bets elsewhere in the space as well:\n\nMeta's Instagram is testing the micro drama format in India with a series. TikTok, which is already widely used by short dramas for marketing, added a section called TikTok Minis where you can binge on bite-sized series without leaving the app.\n\nDespite the format's burgeoning popularity, there are those who question its long-term viability. Some investors told Business Insider they had held back from the space because of concerns that the format wouldn't succeed in areas beyond its core of female-targeted romances.",

    "title": "Trump says he is instructing 'representatives' to buy $200 billion in mortgage bond in an effort to push down rates",
    "description": "Trump said Thursday that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, aiming to lower interest rates and monthly payments.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, arguing the move would lower interest rates and monthly housing payments.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said the directive was possible because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have \"$200 billion in cash.\" He added the bond purchases would help \"make the cost of owning a home more affordable.\"\n\nIt was not clear who Trump meant by his \"representatives,\" or which entity would carry out the purchases. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.\n\nTrump's proposal for his representatives to buy housing bonds comes on the heels of a Wednesday statement made by the president, in which he said he would ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that many housing economists say such a ban would do little to improve national housing affordability. It is unclear what effect Trump's latest proposal would have on the market.\n\nRichard Green, director and chair of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, told Business Insider that Trump's proposal doesn't go far enough to solve the fundamental problem with American housing, which is that there simply aren't enough homes for each person who wants to buy one.\n\nHowever, he added, even the $200 billion proposal is more symbolic than substantive.\n\n\"When the Fed was involved in buying mortgages, they were buying trillions, right? So this is a gesture, I suppose,\" Green said. \"And of course, if you drop interest rates down, it will show up at higher house prices, which means that down payment becomes more difficult.\"\n\n\"So it's not like magic, that if you push down mortgage interest rates, that you're going to make housing less or more affordable,\" Green added. \"But the big thing is that $200 billion sounds like a big number, but in context, it's not all that much.\"\n\nTrump's plan also came just a day after he signed an executive order that bans defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends unless they meet certain standards.\n\nThe approach fits with a broader shift in Trump's second-term economic playbook, as previously reported by Business Insider's Emily Stewart. The Trump administration seems to have embraced a more interventionist style of capitalism, with the federal government taking a more active role in markets, including holding direct stakes in private companies.\n\nTrump's latest rhetoric also appears to target the affordability crisis as frustration over prices builds and as midterm elections near.\n\nHousing, food, and everyday expenses remain stubbornly expensive since Trump took office for the second time, and his tariffs did not help. Zohran Mamdani, the new mayor of NYC, who had a meeting with Trump, notably won by running on universal childcare and affordable housing. According to a poll by Lake Research Partners in October 2025, support for affordability and living-wage policies in competitive swing districts is high and would give candidates who run on economic issues an advantage.",

For a limited time, players can earn Fallout operator skins and other themed rewards by unlocking them in free and paid event passes. Here's a look at all Fallout rewards in Call of Duty and how you unlock them during the event.\n\nCall of Duty's Fallout event runs from now until January 29. This adds operator skins and cosmetics themed around Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show. While there are plenty of free rewards to earn, you'll need to purchase the paid \"premium\" pass for 1,100 CoD Points ($10) if you want to unlock all items for the event.\n\nThere are 20 rewards in total for the Fallout event. There are 10 rewards in the free pass, and 10 more optional rewards can be unlocked with the paid pass. The highlights of the free pass include two vault dweller operator skins and the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun. The paid pass is required to unlock Maximus and The Ghoul characters from the show.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the character, Lucy MacLean, will arrive as a shop bundle at a later date. Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.\n\nAll Fallout event rewards can be seen below. This is an XP-based event, so you'll simply need to grind XP across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. For multiplayer, objective modes like Kill Confirmed and Domination work best, while Plunder and Casual battle royale modes will yield more XP for Warzone. This is also a good time to use double XP tokens if you have them.\n\nIt's worth noting that this crossover features Fallout-themed game modes and events across multiplayer, Zombies, Endgame, and Warzone. Make sure to check out all the details about Season 1 Reloaded's new content, and the full patch notes can be found here.\n\nThis is an operator skin for David Mason, putting him in Fallout's iconic blue vault suit.

The skin is a paid reward that you unlock automatically if you purchase the paid event pass.\n\nThis reward is a loading screen with iconic Fallout-themed artwork, and it is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is a cosmetic blueprint for the Flatline MK II melee weapon, which makes it look like the Torch Blade used by the Brotherhood of Steel. This is unlocked in the paid pass.\n\nThis reward is a one-hour double weapon XP token, and it is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is a finishing move that lets your character wield a minigun to takedown opponents. This is available to unlock in the paid pass.\n\nThis is an animated emblem of Fallout's Vault Boy.

The reward is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is an animated calling card featuring Maximus launching upwards in a power armor suit.

The reward is available to unlock in the paid pass.\n\nThe final reward in the free pass is the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun.\n\nThe Sturmwolf 45 is basically a renamed variant of Call of Duty's popular UMP45.

No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist.\nSimilar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as \"Light Green.\" Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "OpenAI  invites you to hand over your medical information. Maybe don't?",
    "fullText": "This week, OpenAI announced its new ChatGPT Health feature, which will let users upload their medical records and ask health related questions. However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons.\n\nThe new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n\nCurrently, there's a waitlist to At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.",

    "title": "There's Actually a Way to Mix and Match Your Cordless Tool Batteries",
    "description": "Tool brands each have their own closed battery systems. You don't have to put up with that.",
    "fullText": "When shopping for cordless power tools, you'd think you could simply purchase the best option of each to fit your needs. But there's a big problem that makes this a lot harder (and more expensive) than it should be: battery incompatibility. By design, you can’t simply pop a Ryobi battery into a DeWalt tool and expect it to work. Engineering decisions aside, using proprietary batteries allows companies to create a sort of obligatory brand loyalty, forcing you to stick with their line of tools unless you want to invest in a whole new set of batteries for every new tool you buy.\n\nIf you've been building your cordless tool collection for some time, you may wind up with four or five different chargers and multiple batteries cluttering your workspace. And that clutter can be expensive, because you wind up buying more chargers and batteries than you might not need if batteries were interchangeable.\n\nBut it turns out they are, sort of. You can actually swap batteries between brands—you just need the right adapters.\n\nThere are two kinds of battery adapters to consider:\n\nInter-brand adapters allow you to use one brand’s batteries in another brand’s tool (like DeWalt batteries in Milwaukee tools).\n\nVoltage adapters allow you to use a different voltage battery than the tool expects (say, a 20-volt battery in a 18-volt tool).\n\nThese adapters are a fairly simple solution to the problem of incompatible battery systems. If you have a lot of DeWalt tools, for example, you can purchase a Milwaukee tool without a battery (which will be cheaper) and just use an adapter to plug in one of the DeWalt batteries you already have.\n\nOf course, these batteries weren’t specifically designed for these tools, so there can be some trade-offs. While tool performance has been found to be broadly similar (and some tools even performed better when using batteries from different brands), for some tools (like grinders and some circular saws) there’s a dropoff in power and performance when using an adapter. That said, you might not notice it if you're just looking to tackling simple DIY projects around the house.\n\nAnother caveat to consider: You might lose some features. Some tools are designed to communicate with the battery to modulate power draw in order to extend the life of the battery, and using an adapter will remove this functionality. But again, if you’re simply using a power drill for basic maintenance tasks, this might not be a huge issue for you.\n\nIf you’ve got a bunch of disparate tool brands, of course, buying multiple adapters might not seem like much of an improvement over your collection of batteries and chargers. If this is you, consider something like the Ceenr PDNation Universal Battery System, which provides an 18-volt battery and a series of adapters that allow it to be used in a wide range of power tools, including major brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee, and DeWalt.\n\nFor example, you can buy a battery with an adapter for DeWalt tools, then buy a second adapter for the same battery that will work with Makita tools. This means you can standardize on one battery system for pretty much any tool you buy (it’s not a truly universal system, since you’re dependent on the range of adapters they offer, but it’s probably close enough for most people).\n\nAs with other adapters, there can be some performance loss using a universal adapter, but by and large, it’s probably not a big issue if you’re doing work around the house, as opposed to working professionally on a job site.",

    "title": "Google's Getting Rid of a Way to Import Third-Party Accounts Into Gmail",
    "description": "This month, Gmail is ending POP support, which can break syncing your email from third-party accounts.",
    "fullText": "If you've been running several email accounts through your Gmail, you might want to double-check your settings this month—that's because Google is ending support for the POP3 protocol that can sync emails from third-party accounts. And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.\n\nPOP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.\n\nIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\n\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.\n\nUse IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.\n\nThe IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n\nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.",

    "title": "Use RICE to Prioritize Your To-Dos",
    "description": "The RICE method requires a little math, but it might be just the thing you need to tackle the new year.",
    "fullText": "Whenever you have a bunch of looming tasks—as many of us do at the start of the new year, when everyone actually \"circles back\" on the things we've been putting off—having a structured to-do list is an essential part of getting everything done. Determining what goes on that list and in what order, though, is a task all its own. I've covered a lot of ways to do that, but if you're stuck with a high volume of important responsibilities, you need an approach that matches the complexity of what you're trying to do—and that's where the RICE method comes into play.\n\nRICE, as you probably guessed, is an acronym. Here's what it stands for:\n\nReach: How many people or parts of your life or project this task will impact\n\nImpact: How meaningful that impact will be if and when it's done correctly\n\nConfidence: How sure you are about your estimates of the other three factors\n\nEffort: The time, energy, knowledge, and resources required\n\nA unique combination of those factors is going to give you guidance on which tasks are the most crucial to prioritize, which is helpful when you're overloaded by information and dread, unable to think about when or where to get started.\n\nI won't lie to you: This method is more convoluted than some of the others I've covered in the past. I might even recommend trying a simpler prioritization technique, like the Eisenhower matrix, before you try this one and only whip this out if Eisenhower or its peers aren't given you solid results. RICE takes a little time—and that's because you need to do some math.\n\nStart by writing down all your tasks. Under each, you're assigning numbers. The Reach score will be the number of people or parts of your life or project that the task will impact and the Impact score is a 3 (massive impact), 2 (high), 1 (medium), .5 (low), or .25 (minimal impact). Confidence should be a 100, 80, or 50, to represent the percentage of confidence you feel in your estimates and abilities. You can use any number between 0 and 100, but falling back on those three just makes it easier. Most adherents of this method use a complicated math equation (determining \"person-months\") for Effort, but I'm going to simplify that for you. Score it the same way you scored Impact, with a 3 for multiple days or resources, 2 for a day, 1 for half a day, .5 for an hour, and .25 for a half an hour or less. You can also score Reach that way if you're working on a personal project and your results won't necessarily reach a big number of people. In that case, think about the different areas of your life or personal goals it will affect and use that 3-to-.25 scale.\n\nThat part is all subjective, similar to using the ABCDE method to assign grades to your to-dos. It can't be avoided—you won't know the true resources required or reach of the project until it's done—but you can quantify it a bit.\n\nNext, you do math. It's R x I x C divided by E. You'll end up with a numerical score for each task. Rank the tasks in descending order, with the biggest numbers first. Obviously, you may find that some can't be completed until others are done, so use your discretion there, but for the most part, you've just created a clear outline of which things will have the biggest impact and reach and you can at least know where to start. Add each into your calendar using time boxing and time blocking, then get after it. Knowing you have a plan of attack is half the motivational battle.",

    "description": "Find out who got a 10 and who is facing an uncertain international future with our Ashes player ratings.",
    "fullText": "The Ashes series is over and, once again, it finishes with Australia holding the urn.\n\nEngland did avoid a clean sweep with victory in Melbourne but Australia reasserted their dominance in Sydney this week.\n\nHere we hand out player ratings for the whole series.\n\nZak Crawley – 5 – Averaged 27, which was entirely predictable at the beginning of the series. Did not live up to the billing of a man backed for Australia and should not be guaranteed a place for the home summer.\n\nBen Duckett – 3 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best all-format batters in the world, leaves with career at a crossroads. Did not pass 50, dropped catches and was caught on video in Noosa. Now goes to England's white-ball tours and the Indian Premier League, when a break might be the smart option.\n\nJacob Bethell – 7 – Where has he been? How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.\n\nJoe Root – 7 – Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.\n\nJamie Smith – 3 – Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?\n\nWill Jacks – 5 – Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?\n\nBrydon Carse – 6 – A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.\n\nMatthew Potts – 1 – Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.\n\nJosh Tongue – 7 – Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.\n\nMark Wood – 2 – A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?\n\nJofra Archer – 6 – Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.\n\nOllie Pope – 3 – Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.\n\nGus Atkinson – 3 – One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.\n\nShoaib Bashir – 0 – Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nThe Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction\n\nJake Weatherald – 4 – Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.\n\nTravis Head – 10 – The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.\n\nSteve Smith – 7 – Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 5 – A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.\n\nAlex Carey – 9 – One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.\n\nBeau Webster – 5 – When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.\n\nMichael Neser – 7 – Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.\n\nMitchell Starc – 10 – This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.\n\nScott Boland – 7 – Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.\n\nBrendan Doggett – 4 – Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.\n\nPat Cummins – 6 – Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.\n\nNathan Lyon – 4 – Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.\n\nJosh Inglis – 3 – Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.\n\nJhye Richardson – 2 – Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs. Should get another chance.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win",

    "fullText": "Ethan Nwaneri had a breakout season last term when the Arsenal forward deputised so impressively for the injured Bukayo Saka.\n\nHe played mostly on the right wing and scored nine goals in 37 appearances in all competitions to mark himself out as one of England's most talented young players.\n\nNwaneri, now 18, also became the second-youngest goalscorer in Champions League history when he netted against Girona last January at 17 years and 314 days old - only Jude Bellingham did so at a younger age.\n\nThe England Under-21 forward is the youngest player to feature in the Premier League thanks to a debut against Brentford at the age of 15 years and 181 days in September 2022.\n\nSo, as well as those admirable performances in 2024-25, it also feels as though Nwaneri has been on the first-team scene for a long time.\n\nYet this season, his involvement has been limited.\n\nNwaneri has made 11 appearances in all competitions, starting just three times across matches in the Carabao Cup and Champions League. He has played just 446 minutes and has scored one goal.\n\nThe Gunners spent about £250m bringing in eight players over the summer to increase the depth in their squad, with Martin Zubimendi, Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and even the younger Noni Madueke 'win now signings'.\n\nIt has worked, with Arsenal five points clear at the top of the Premier League and with a perfect record in the Champions League.\n\nMikel Arteta's side have won 23, drawn four and lost just two of their 29 matches and if they beat Liverpool in the league on Thursday, they will be eight points clear of Manchester City.\n\nBut those experienced signings, and Arsenal's success, has come at a cost to younger members of the squad like Nwaneri.",

    "fullText": "An influential Manchester United fan group is planning a protest against the ownership, which it accuses of \"turning the club into a circus\".\n\nThe 1958 group was responsible for protests at the way United was being run which attracted thousands in March last year - although they scrapped a plan to repeat it before the opening home game of this season against Arsenal.\n\nDiscontent against minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe been growing in recent weeks, and the appointment and subsequent dismissal of Ruben Amorim has triggered a call to protest before the Red Devils play Fulham on 1 February.\n\nFans held up an anti-Ratcliffe banner at Turf Moor on Wednesday before the 2-2 draw with Burnley, when supporters also sang vicious songs against co-chairman Joel Glazer.\n\n\"After lurching from one disaster to another, Ratcliffe comes across as an incompetent clown turning the club into a circus,\" said the 1958 group in a statement.\n\n\"Instead of best in class, we're a laughing stock.\n\n\"It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United. On the pitch, we are watching mediocre performances from an average team drifting without identity, direction, or ambition. Off it, the chaos is even worse.\"\n\nSenior United officials are continuing their search for a caretaker boss to replace Amorim, although sources with an understanding of the situation say substantive conversations with front-runners Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are yet to take place.\n\nSources close to Ratcliffe defend him, pointing to the £250m of his own money he has invested in the club, including a complete renovation of United's Carrington training complex, as proof he is genuine in his wish to drive the club forward.\n\nHowever, others point to the decision to retain Erik ten Hag following the 2024 FA Cup final win over Manchester City, invest £200m in new players, then sack the Dutchman just nine games into the new Premier League season, and then doing something similar with Amorim after last term's 15th-placed finish, as clear examples of flawed thinking.",

    "description": "Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli is criticised for pushing Conor Bradley while he was down injured - but Liverpool boss Arne Slot defends him.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli has apologised for trying to push injured Liverpool defender Conor Bradley off the pitch during Thursday's 0-0 draw between the teams.\n\nNorthern Ireland international Bradley landed awkwardly near the touchline when chasing the ball in stoppage time, falling to the ground and immediately clutching his knee.\n\nMartinelli then dropped the ball on the full-back before shoving him in the back in an attempt to get him off the playing surface to allow the game to continue.\n\nThat action sparked a melee between the two sets of players, with Martinelli and Liverpool's Ibrahima Konate both yellow-carded for their involvement.\n\nAfter receiving treatment, Bradley was taken away on a stretcher and was later seen leaving Emirates Stadium on crutches and with a knee brace.\n\nFormer Manchester United players Gary Neville and Roy Keane were both highly critical of Martinelli, with Neville saying his actions were \"absolutely disgraceful\" and describing the Arsenal winger as an \"idiot\".\n\nMartinelli later issued an apology on social media, saying the two players had been in contact and he had already said sorry.\n\n\"I really didn't understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment,\" Martinelli posted on Instagram.\n\n\"I want to say I'm deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.\"\n\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot defended Martinelli after the match, suggesting the wider issue of time-wasting in football may have led to the flashpoint.\n\n\"I don't know Gabriel Martinelli, but he comes across as a nice guy,\" said Slot.\n\n\"I think the problem for him - and it's a problem in general in football - is that there is so much time-wasting and players pretending that they are injured in the final parts of the game and during the game, that you can sometimes be annoyed if you want to try to score a goal that you think the player is time-wasting.\n\n\"You cannot ask Martinelli to think so clear in the 94th minute.\"",

    "fullText": "It was after Liverpool's 4-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven at Anfield in November that Steven Gerrard said his old team just kept on \"bleeding\".\n\nA ninth defeat in 12 matches for Liverpool was inflicted that night, but Liverpool have stemmed the painful flow and are now 10 games unbeaten since being embarrassed by the Dutch champions.\n\nWith a spirited display in Thursday's goalless draw against leaders Arsenal, Arne Slot's side became the first visiting team to take a Premier League point at Emirates Stadium since Manchester City in September.\n\nConor Bradley's first-half effort which struck the crossbar was the closest either side went to scoring, while Liverpool were the better team in the second half with 66% possession.\n\nWithout a recognised striker, however, they lacked a focal point to their attacks.\n\nHad Hugo Ekitike been fit enough to feature, the visitors could perhaps have taken the win, though this was still a decent night for Liverpool.\n\nAfter poor showings in recent draws against Leeds and Fulham, last season's champions delivered a performance from which Slot can take plenty of positives.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch were solid in midfield and Milos Kerkez had arguably his best game for the club as he dealt superbly with the threat of Bukayo Saka.\n\nDefensively, Liverpool prevented Arsenal having an attempt in the second half until stoppage time. Mikel Arteta's side have now failed to score against Liverpool in both games this season.\n\n\"I think Arne Slot will be absolutely delighted with the performance of the players,\" said ex-Reds forward Daniel Sturridge on Sky Sports.\n\n\"You've got to give him credit for his game plan. They weathered the storm for the first 20 minutes. After that, their work rate, how tenacious they were, it was a very experienced performance and they showed why they are champions.\n\n\"They lacked the cutting edge up front but had very positive moments. Jeremie Frimpong was a threat all night but missed the final pass. Florian Wirtz was very good, picked up a load of pockets and was very clean tonight. The list goes on. The defence was magnificent.\n\n\"They stopped attacks all night and I think the manager and players should be very proud of themselves. They performed exceptionally.\"",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): He kept a clean sheet against Sunderland, and he's really starting to command as a regular number one. He's starting to show that he commands the area in the right way. Obviously a penalty save always helps.\n\nMichael Keane (Everton): The guy they tried to get rid of, they guy they wanted to replace, the guy they want to move on from, the guy who keeps telling them no. He keeps scoring, he keeps delivering. I think he's gotten really comfortable within his own skin as a human.\n\nIbrahima Konate (Liverpool): I thought this was a vintage Konate performance. Not only did he deliver physically, which we know he can do, but he was in a position to look after his team-mates. When Gabriel Martinelli tried to crudely push Conor Bradley off the pitch at the end, I'm glad Konate stuck up for his team. He got back physically, wasn't a liability and stood up strong.\n\nMax Alleyne (Manchester City): The young man played really, really well against a tough Brighton team. He never got caught wanting and had an opportunity to score. He conducted himself well, and I thought it was a glowing endorsement from Pep Guardiola to start him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): The best player on the pitch. People will say: \"Oh what about him and him?\" But I don't care. If you play football and watch football, you know that Szoboszlai was everywhere. Did the dirty stuff, the horrible stuff, but was one of the best attacking options for Liverpool apart from Jeremie Frimpong. He dictated the play, it was a very good performance.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): He's just a beast. The work that he has done, and the work Eddie Howe has done on him, is just frightening. He keeps popping up with important goals, but remember that they signed him as a striker. He's just turned into a beast of a midfielder who runs all over you.\n\nBrenden Aaronson (Leeds): A couple of goals - though he was at fault for the handball, which was only down to him not being brave enough to take one in the face. Scored two and has won over the Leeds faithful. He's having a really good season and has borne the brunt of some unfair criticism from Leeds fans.\n\nFerdi Kadioglu (Brighton): He was a thorn in Nathan Ake's side all day. On another day, he'd be a bit lucky and score a goal or two, but he was excellent. Brighton weren't scared of Manchester City at all.\n\nHarvey Barnes (Newcastle): Two goals, the second being the match-winner, which was absolute limbs and scenes. He's another player where you're like: \"Go on, show us who you are.\" Unfortunately he always leaves you a little bit wanting. I'm always thinking there's more to come from him. That's not to take anything away from his goals.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Sixteen goals this season. We spoke about him last week - he's flying. Scoring again, carrying Brentford. They've got a real chance as long as he stays fit and continues doing what he's doing.\n\nBenjamin Sesko (Manchester United): He has had a torrid start to his Manchester United career. But he scored two goals at Burnley and you have to give it to him.\n\nKeith Andrews (Brentford): It was a massive result for Brentford to beat Sunderland 3-0. At the start of the season, a lot of people were questioning whether Keith was the right man for the job and whether Brentford could stay in the league.\n\nHis inexperience, the squad getting depleted... now they find themselves on the path towards European places. It's frightening. Sunderland have been really good and I expected them to deal with the physicality of Brentford, but Brentford beat them up.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?
