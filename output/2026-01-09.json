    "description": "Here's everything Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud said ahead of Monday's wild-card round matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
    "fullText": "Here's everything Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud said ahead of Monday's wild-card round matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers, including his thoughts on facing T.J. Watt and more.\n\nQuestion: On if the playoff experience he’s gained helps him as he prepares for this postseason\n\nC.J. Stroud: “I'm excited. The experience that I've been able to gain in the last two years has been very important and helpful. But this is a new year, and I never played on the road in a Wild Card game, so there’s a new experience in that. But I have a good idea of how some of these games go and that's… You don't have an idea. It can go any way, and this is a good team we're playing against. So, I’m trying to be prepared in my preparation as much as I can.”\n\nQ: On if he gets a little more excited when you’re playing in these games at this time of year\n\nStroud: “Yes and no. I think when the ball is snapped, you're just locked in. But I think the added extra cameras, extra eyes and stuff, you know, there's a little more eyes on you. I'm excited and I've played in some big games in my career and… Every next one is a bigger one. I just want to be able to handle this moment as best as I can and be present and enjoy it.”\n\nQ: On if playoff football is different or if it feels different\n\nStroud: “No, I wouldn't say it feels different. I think the margins are smaller. I think success is winning if you can win. I think that's the biggest thing is to find a way to win.”\n\nStroud: “Yeah, I have a lot of faith in Ka’imi. I think he's done a great job for us this year.”\n\nQ: On how the offensive line has performed this year\n\nStroud: “I think they're doing amazing. I think a lot of guys have been in there. I think schematically, too, me trying to get the ball out as fast as possible and taking one if one is there. I thought we've all grown from Tytus [Howard] all the way down to me. I think the leadership in that room has grown. I think Cole [Popovich] has done an amazing job. He's hard on those guys. He yells, he cusses, he does everything that you think an offensive line coach should do. Those guys, they're, ‘Yes, sir,’ and ‘No, sir.’ They also don't back down when a challenge is presented. They're the heartbeat of our team. We go as far as they go.”\n\nQ: On building chemistry with other pass catchers, outside of WR Nico Collins, throughout the season\n\nStroud: “Yeah, it's helpful. I think our young guys have gotten a lot of experience. There's still a lot of things they need to learn. They have to learn fast now. I'm excited for that. But I think every year I've had great receivers. Now we're just a little healthier, which is dope. So, I'm excited. I think this will be a great challenge for us. They're really good in the back end and do a great job in different coverages. We got to be able to identify what we're seeing and all be on the same page and go from there.”\n\nQ: On what he’s seen from the Pittsburgh Steelers pass rush\n\nStroud: “They [the Pittsburgh Steelers] rush together. They're going to push the pocket and burn the edge. I think they do a great job even with their effort. They’re getting chips and things like that the whole game and they're still going very hard. I have a lot of respect for [Alex] Highsmith and [T.J.] Watt and their interior guys. I think their whole defensive line is the heartbeat of their team. Then you've got Patrick Queen, who's a dog and been a great player in this league for a long time. Then Jalen [Ramsey], leading the guys in the back end. I think, overall, they've done a really good job. They make it hard and they play really hard. It's going to be a challenge. Up front, I respect them to a high standard and how Mike [Tomlin] coaches those guys as well.”\n\nQ: On how the game changes from the regular season to the playoffs\n\nStroud: “I wouldn't say it changes. The margin of the execution is just smaller. The guys are on a little more. I won’t change my preparation. I'll do the same things that I've always done. Maybe a little more here and a little less there. But whatever I need to do to be prepared. No special sauce, no special ingredient, still football. I just got to go and execute at a high level.”\n\nQ: On Offensive Coordinator Nick Caley and what stands out about him\n\nStroud: “I think his ability to block out the noise and continue to go forward. I think everybody in this day, and age wants a microwave. They want to throw something in the microwave, let it heat up fast and be a new product. That's none of us. Football is an oven type of sport or whatever you use, a Crock-Pot, whatever any of y'all use. I think this team, we try to do our best to block out the noise and stay in our brotherhood and lean on one another. I thought he's done a great job of leaning on us, asking us what we like, even if it didn't work, like not running away from asking guys what they like and putting guys in a position to do what we need to do best. We're still working. We still got a ways to go. But I'm just proud of that guy. I think he's done a heck of a job of calling it, of being honest and… One thing I respect about ‘Cales’ is he doesn't point fingers. If he does, it's in the right way. It's not like blame game. It's like, ‘Hey, you can be better here because I know you can.’ He's uplifting and I have a lot of love for that guy. He's done a heck of a job for us this year.”\n\nOn if his willingness to use his legs increases in playoff games\n\n“I don't know. I just try to play as fast as I can. I think every game I try to use my legs if I need to. But sometimes it doesn't present. I've been getting spied lately. So, that's kind of cool. I haven't gotten spied in my career probably in a long time. But whatever the play presents. Whatever way you've got to get the job done, get it done.”\n\nQ: On if there was any challenge of when to use his legs after the concussion\n\nStroud: “No, I don't live in fear, at least I try not to. I think this game, if you think about getting hurt, you think about something happening, is when it usually happens. I try my best to play fast and protect myself as well, though.”\n\nQ: On if he recalls watching Pittsburgh Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers play and what it means to face him in the playoffs\n\nStroud: “I'm a big fan of Aaron. I love what he does. He's been a heck of a player. I think he's a top-three quarterback to ever touch a football. He's done some really cool things in the sport. His mechanics are through the roof. His ability to use his pronation on his wrist and how he flicks the ball is just dope. I'm a big fan of his. This will be, I think, my second time facing him. I'm a big fan of his. I'm not going to be rooting for him on Monday night, but I think he's a heck of a player and I have a lot of respect for him. He's done it for a long time and is even doing it at a high level at his age now in year 21 or whatever it is for him. A lot of respect for him.”\n\nStroud: “Higgins has grown a lot. I think he's somebody who has killed people with extra movement and throwing his head and doing all these different releases and stuff. But I think I told him he's so big, fast and strong, the quicker you get open, the better. Especially for me, you're not really running around against defensive backs, you're running routes against the defensive line. I think it's somewhere he's grown in a lot of areas. I think he's grown in the run game, wanting to go block. I think all that stuff helps him. But he's done a tremendous job for us and he's going to be a heck of a player in this league for a long time.”\n\nQ: On his mindset going into the playoffs this year as opposed to the first two seasons\n\nQ: On how the team can take the adversity they faced in the regular season and carry it over to the playoffs\n\nStroud: “I think we have a lot of experience in high-pressure moments, high-pressure games. It'll be an opportunity for us to do it again. I think it's a heck of an opportunity to play in a legendary stadium against a legendary coach, a legendary team. This is going to be a great challenge. We've got to be ready. It's going to be cold and it's going to be loud and it's going to be a lot of elements that are not for us but are against us. But we've been in this before. We've played plenty of cold games, plenty of loud games, been in silent operations. A lot of experience in a lot of different ways. I think that will pay off when we go up there on Monday night.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: What did Texans QB C.J. Stroud say before wild-card game vs. Steelers?",

    "fullText": "Today, the North Carolina Courage announced that they have signed CANWNT goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan to a two-year, fully-guaranteed contract through the 2027 season.\n\n“I can’t wait to join the Courage and bring my family to North Carolina. This team’s soccer identity and tactical systems are so exciting and fit the way I like to play as well. I’m really looking forward to joining the team, getting to work on the field, and focusing on a great season this year,” said Sheridan.\n\nWidely considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world, Sheridan has consistently found herself with numerous accolades and awards. She was named to NWSL Best XI First Team in 2021 and 2022, and Second Team in 2023. The GK also took home Goalkeeper of the Year honors in 2022.\n\nIn nine seasons, she earned 42 clean sheets in 166 regular season appearances. With the San Diego Wave, she help guide them to the 2023 NWSL Shield and 2024 NWSL Challenge Cup.\n\n“We’re delighted to welcome Kailen Sheridan to the club. She is an elite goalkeeper with proven experience at the highest level, and her leadership, distribution and shot-stopping ability immediately raise the standard of our squad. Kailen brings a strong mentality and professionalism that will be invaluable both on and off the pitch, and we’re confident she will play a key role in helping us achieve our objectives moving forward,” said Courage Chief Soccer Officer Ceri Bowley.\n\nInternationally, she has 63 appearances for the Canada Women’s National Team. In 2020, with her country, won the 2020 Olympic Gold Medal. She has represented her country at two World Cups and Olympics.\n\nAfter the departure of Casey Murphy, goalkeeper became a priority for NC Courage. And now, the club just brought in one of the very best. North Carolina will be a team to watch in 2026 after narrowly missing the playoffs this past season.",

    "title": "Packers vs. Bears playoff preview: Who the edge in turnovers and situationally?",
    "description": "Playoff games often come down to winning the turnover battle and coming up big in the biggest situations. Who has the edge between Packers and Bears?",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers (9-7-1) are going on the road to play the Chicago Bears (11-6) in the NFC Wild Card Round on Saturday at Soldier Field. The rubber match between the two NFC North rivals will determine who goes to the NFC Divisional Round and who is headed for the offseason.\n\nFootball is a complicated game, but finding the reasons for winning individual matchups between teams each week is often a straightforward exercise. What wins games? Excellent quarterback play, winning the line of scrimmage, taking care of the football and taking it away, controlling the important situations and overcoming or taking advantage of the injury situation.\n\nSo, who has the edge in the turnover department and in the game's biggest situations?\n\nTakeaways: GB, 14 (26th) CHI, 33 (1st)\n\nInterceptions: GB, 7 (28th) CHI, 23 (1st)\n\nFumbles recovered: GB, 7 (17th) CHI, 10 (4th)\n\nGiveaways: GB, 13 (3rd) CHI, 11 (1st)\n\nInterceptions thrown: GB, 7 (1st) CHI, 7 (1st)\n\nFumbles lost: GB, 6 (6th) CHI, 4 (3rd)\n\nTurnover differential: GB, +1 (12th) CHI, +22 (1st)\n\nW-L when winning turnover battle: GB, 5-1 CHI, 10-1\n\nThird down % (offense): GB, 48.8 (2nd) CHI, 42.7 (7th)\n\nThird down % (defense): GB, 39.4 (14th) CHI, 40.8 (22nd)\n\nThird down passer rating: GB, 101.2 (3rd) CHI, 97.2 (9th)\n\nRed zone TD% (offense): GB, 57.6 (14th) CHI, 58.2 (12th)\n\nRed zone TD% (defense): GB, 59.6 (21st) CHI, 56.1 (15th)\n\nRed zone TD passes: GB, 18 (7th) CHI, 14 (15th)\n\nFourth down % (offense): GB, 56.0 (18th) CHI, 51.7 (21st)\n\nFourth down % (defense): GB, 55.6 (18th) CHI, 47.8 (8th)\n\nPoints off turnovers: GB, 16 (31st) CHI, 90 (2nd)\n\nHow important will turnovers and situational football be in the rubber match? The first matchup featured an interception in the red zone on fourth down. The rematch featured a fumble inside the 10-yard line and a game-tying touchdown pass in the red zone on fourth down, and the Bears were only in the game because the offense failed on five trips inside the 20.\n\nWhile the Packers appear to have some slight situational edges, especially on third down, the Bears will go into Saturday with massive advantages in the turnover department. Arguably no team has been more dependent on turnovers to win games this season than the Bears, who have a takeaway in 15 of 17 games and lead the league in takeaways and turnover differential this season.\n\nConsider all this: the Bears have multiple takeaways in nine games this season and are 9-0 in those games. When not generating at least two takeaways? The Bears are 2-6, including a Week 14 loss to the Packers and back-to-back losses to end the season. And when not getting any turnovers? The Bears are 0-2, with a 31-point loss and a 14-point loss.\n\nJordan Love and Caleb Williams have similar turnover-worthy play percentages in 2025. Both have been elite at avoiding the dangerous play, complicating the path for the Packers to generate a takeaway but also making life difficult on the turnover-dependent Bears. Both teams are averaging fewer than one giveaway a game in 2025.\n\nTurnovers have often killed the Packers. An interception in Cleveland helped spark the comeback. A fumble in Dallas set up a go-ahead touchdown before the half. A fumble in the red zone versus Carolina hurt late. An interception in Denver turned the game. A lost fumble in Chicago cost the Packers what could have been game-ending points. These are the moments Green Bay must avoid against the Bears on Saturday.\n\nThe red zone has been a telling area for the Packers all season. When they score touchdowns inside the 20, they are hard to beat. But several of Green Bay's worst losses this season have been a direct result of failures in the red zone, including the Week 16 loss in Chicago (0-for-5 scoring touchdowns). During a two-week stretch in Denver and Chicago, the Packers went 1-for-9. In what could be a high scoring but low possession contest, scoring in the red zone will be absolutely vital for both teams. The Packers know it. The Bears know it. The red zone is the X-factor on Saturday.\n\nThird down was a strength for Love throughout the 2025 season. He will push the ball past the sticks and aggressively make throws to convert (or attempt to convert) on third down. Defensively, the Packers were dominating on third down with Micah Parsons, but getting off the field has gotten more difficult without the closer disrupting quarterbacks and creating negative plays. At this point, neither team has the pass-rush to consistently dominate on third down. Love has been one of the NFL's best on third down, and Williams remains one of the NFL's most creative off-schedule playmakers regardless of down.\n\nOverall, the Bears' ability to take the ball away and win the turnover battle looks like an overwhelming factor in Chicago's favor. Can the Packers protect the ball and convert in the red zone? A lot of points are possible if Love doesn't have the turnover and the Packers get the job done inside the 20. But as the first two meetings showed, every single play in the game's biggest moments matter. The guess here is that we will be able to evaluate turnovers and situational football and easily identify the game's winner by the end of Saturday night.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Packers vs. Bears playoff preview: Who the edge in turnovers and situationally?",

    "fullText": "In what increasingly resembles NFL free agency, the transfer portal now commands more attention than National Signing Day or even the early signing period. Love it or hate it, it isn’t going anywhere—and every program in the country feels its impact.\n\nBut the portal also gives players the same flexibility coaches enjoy: the ability to leave when a better opportunity presents itself. On Thursday, former Texas A&M redshirt junior tight end Theo Melin Öhrström found exactly that, landing with an ACC‑bound program not too far from Aggieland.\n\nAccording to On3Sports’ Hayes Fawcett, Öhrström will join the SMU Mustangs for the 2026 season and is expected to arrive in Dallas with up to two years of eligibility remaining. The former four‑star prospect stayed through the coaching transition in College Station and continued to make steady progress, earning more snaps as his career unfolded. He was firmly in the mix to start for the Aggies in 2026, but ultimately opted for a fresh start.\n\nAt SMU, he’ll have a much clearer path as the main focus at the position and can serve as the veteran presence in a young tight end room next season.\n\nYou can see his announcement below.\n\nBREAKING: Texas A&M transfer TE Theo Melin Ohrstrom has Committed to SMU, he tells @On3Sports\n\nHe totaled 352 yards and 3 TDs in his time with the Aggieshttps://t.co/RlUbB6Fk7q pic.twitter.com/sYJsfYzlSk\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 8, 2026\n\nThe NCAA football transfer portal opened Jan. 2 and runs through Jan. 16.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions.

(We're told ownership wants to recommend that he be retained by the new head coach there.)\n\nIn previous seasons, the Cowboys would look at only a handful of candidates, rather than interviewing as many as possible.\n\nBut our own Mike Fisher has stated that having 10-15 coaching candidates come through and offer their thoughts on how your team can improve is invaluable. Even if you don't intend to hire them, pick their brains.\n\nWhy not get as much outside information on where your team can improve?\n\nLeonhard is the most accomplished of the three - and he's got a Schotty background.\n\nThe bad news on Daronte Jones? He's a Flores assistant ... which means you might not get Flores, who is seeking a head coaching job.\n\nThe bad news on Banda? Same thing as it relates to Schwartz.\n\nBut at least there is this: Cowboys Nation didn't want the franchise to sit on its hands in this coaching search and waste days while other top candidates get snapped up.\n\nAnd thankfully, Dallas is being proactive.",

That’s why we had success in the World Championship, and we’re going to try to do the same thing in the Olympics.”\n\nWhile Switzerland is not opening play at the Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena as favorites, the red and white will certainly receive a much needed boost due to the return of NHL talent.\n\nMORE:NHL's newest team to host Avalanche in 2027 Winter Classic",

    "fullText": "The Wolverines just landed a huge target through the transfer portal, as former Utah defensive end John Henry Daley is transferring to Michigan to reunite with head coach Kyle Whittingham and edge coach Lewis Powell.\n\nBREAKING: Utah star transfer EDGE John Henry Daley has committed to Michigan, @PeteNakos reports〽️https://t.co/U31NaOwVgy pic.twitter.com/nqFLdW9LL4\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 9, 2026\n\nMichigan beat out Notre Dame and LSU — two places he also visited — as well as BYU in this portal recruitment.\n\nDaley was a three-star high school recruit in the 2021 recruiting class and, as a legacy recruit, chose to go to BYU. After a two-year mission trip with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Brazil, he got on campus and took a redshirt season in 2023 before entering the transfer portal that offseason and heading to Utah.\n\nAfter a minimal-impact 2024 season with the Utes — and only tallying seven total tackles and one sack his first two years in college — Daley had a breakout season this season that resulted in him being named a Second-Team All-American and a First-Team All-Big 12 performer. The 6-foot-4, 255-pounder racked up 48 total tackles, 17.5 tackles for loss, 11.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and one pass deflection in 11 games in 2025.\n\nUnfortunately, Daley’s season came to an abrupt halt when he suffered a non-contact lower-leg injury — reported as a ruptured Achilles — in the penultimate game of the regular season. While he may not be fully recovered by the time spring ball rolls around, he is expected to make a full recovery and be ready to go for the 2026 season.\n\nInjury be damned, Daley still graded out near the top of Pro Football Focus at his position this year. Daley earned a 92.4 overall grade, good for No. 5 at the edge spot in the country only behind David Bailey (Texas Tech, 93.6), Rueben Bain Jr. (Miami, 92.9), Michael Heldman (Central Michigan, 92.8) and Romello Height (Texas Tech, 92.6). Daley also had the second-best pass rush grade (93.7) in the country, just barely behind Bailey (93.9).\n\nWith Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham off to the NFL Draft, defensive end was one of the top needs for the Wolverines in the portal this winter. You can now consider that need checked, although I certainly wouldn’t turn down another edge rusher through the portal if they wanted in. Regardless of what happens next, landing Daley is a massive move for Whittingham and provides defensive coordinator Jay Hill with an instant impact player at a premium position.\n\nDaley — who is rated as the No. 4 overall player in the portal by On3, and the No. 49 overall player in the portal by 247Sports — will have two years of collegiate eligibility remaining. He’s the fifth player to transfer to Ann Arbor this winter, joining Pitt long snapper Nico Crawford, UNLV punter Cam Brown, Pitt kicker Trey Butkowski and Oklahoma running back Taylor Tatum.\n\nCheck out some of Daley’s best highlights at Utah in the video below.",

Insider Jon Heyman is reporting that the much-sought-after free agent is looking for a massive $300 million deal. While it seems highly unlikely he’ll get that from anyone, it sounds like two teams are intensifying talks with the infield All-Star.\n\nWhile his longtime team, the Toronto Blue Jays, continue their flirtation with top free agent Kyle Tucker, Bichette is now getting seriously wooed by both the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Phillies are meeting with Bo Bichette \"in the coming days\", per @MattGelb pic.twitter.com/3HhgtQHwUl\n\n— Talkin' Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) January 8, 2026\n\nA report from Philadelphia Phillies beat writer Matt Gelb reveals that the Phils will be meeting with Bichette in the next few days, likely on Monday.\n\nGelb reports that the team has done “extensive work on the various roster ripple effects of signing him.\n\n“The club’s interest in Bichette is legitimate, and if it results in a deal, it would likely require the team to move on from roster mainstays J.T. Realmuto and Alec Bohm.”\n\nBohm, the Phillies third baseman, just agreed Thursday to a $10.2 million contract for 2026. A trade of Bohm may be necessitated by a Bichette signing, both to free up his money, and to open up a spot in the infield.\n\nRealmuto’s return to Philly in free agency is somewhat in doubt. He’s been a two-time All-Star and a two-time Gold Glover behind the plate for the Phillies over the past seven years.\n\nAs for the Yankees, the Jays’ heated division rival is looking a lot more closely at Bichette as well. This comes as their talks with their own free agent Cody Bellinger have stagnated.\n\nYankees are taking a closer look at Bo Bichette as there's still \"a bit of a gap\" in negotiations with Cody Bellinger. @JonHeyman pic.twitter.com/sWOPNnF6qd\n\n— New York Post Sports (@nypostsports) January 8, 2026\n\nHeyman calls it an “interesting development” as the Yanks are now taking a closer look at Bichette due to the fact that there’s still “a bit of a gap” in their negotiations with Bellinger. The Yankees made a second offer to Belli in recent days. The two sides, however, remain apart.\n\nThe insider also reiterates that New York is listening to trade offers on second baseman Jazz Chisholm, which would open up a spot for Bichette.

    "fullText": "Michigan football fans have been a little uneasy about the transfer portal, having lost a bunch of players (before getting most of the top players back) while not really adding many.\n\nThe Wolverines opened up by getting three special teams specialists -- longsnapper Nico Crawford, punter Cameron Brown, and kicker Trey Butkowski. They followed those up with a surprise running back commit, as Oklahoma's Taylor Tatum, the No. 1 RB in the 2024 class, ended up signing with the maize and blue on Thursday.\n\nBut the visits to Ann Arbor really started to pick up steam starting on Wednesday, and among those who made it to campus was former Utah edge rusher John Henry Daley. Daley is one of the top EDGEs in the portal and obviously has familiarity, having been coached by Kyle Whittingham and now-Michigan edge rusher coach Lewis Powell. He originally played at BYU before transferring to Utah, so he also has familiarity with Jay Hill through his time in Provo.\n\nThough he had made a bevy of visits (to LSU and Notre Dame), he opted to come to the Wolverines, making his commitment official.\n\nBREAKING: Utah star transfer EDGE John Henry Daley has committed to Michigan, @PeteNakos reports〽️https://t.co/U31NaOwVgy pic.twitter.com/nqFLdW9LL4\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 9, 2026\n\nAccording to PFF, Daley had the second-best grade of consistently playing edge rushers in all of 2025. He had a 93.7 grade and finished with 11.5 sacks and a win rate of 24.1% -- good for sixth in the country.\n\nThe Utah native has two years of eligibility remaining and should be a productive pickup for the maize and blue straight out of the gates. That is pending a lower-leg injury he sustained at the end of his career with the Utes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: Michigan football lands elite EDGE John Henry Daley in transfer portal",

    "title": "All About Ole Miss Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss’ Parents, Trent and Cheryl Chambliss",
    "description": "Trent and Cheryl Chambliss welcomed their son, Trinidad, in August 2002",
    "fullText": "Trent and Cheryl Chambliss share two sons, Tyler and Trinidad\n\nTrinidad's father also played college football for Grand Rapids Community College and coached the sport at the quarterback's high school\n\nThe football star maintained his tradition of praying with his mom before every game, even after he transferred to Ole Miss in 2025\n\nTrinidad Chambliss’ rapid rise from a backup Division II transfer to an Ole Miss starter has been nothing short of extraordinary. But his parents, Trent and Cheryl Chambliss, have worked to keep his meteoric ascent in perspective.\n\n“If you’re not having fun, then what’s the whole point?” Trent told the Daily Journal in October 2025. “But you can’t win every game. So therefore, how do you end up learning? How do you grow? … What do we do the next day? And what do we learn? What are they teaching us?”\n\nThe couple raised their two sons, Trinidad and his older brother, Tyler, in Grand Rapids, Mich. Trent is a high school administrator, while Cheryl, now retired, spent her career as a juvenile probation officer, per Yahoo! Sports. Trinidad's father introduced him to the sport and even coached football at his son's high school.\n\nThose early lessons followed the quarterback after he transferred from Division II Ferris State University to the University of Mississippi in 2025. Trinidad unexpectedly moved into the starting lineup after the starter quarterback was injured and has since helped the Rebels become a contender in the 2025 college football playoffs, per Grand Rapids Magazine. Trent and Cheryl have continued to be a constant presence at his games.\n\nHere's everything to know about Trinidad Chambliss' parents, Trent and Cheryl Chambliss.\n\nThough Cheryl and Trent grew up miles apart — she was born in New Jersey and he's from South Bend, Ind. — they eventually made their way to Grand Rapids, the Daily Journal reported. There, they met while practicing for a 3-on-3 basketball tournament and got to know each other more through their mutual friends.\n\nEventually, the couple tied the knot and went on to welcome two sons: Tyler and Trinidad.\n\nTrinidad seems to have inherited his love for football from his dad. Trent moved from his hometown to Grand Rapids to play football at Grand Rapids Community College. But unlike his son, Trent was an offensive lineman, per the Clarion Ledger.\n\nTrinidad's father went on to coach football at Forest Hills Northern, a local high school that Trinidad later attended. According to Grand Rapids Magazine, the future Ole Miss quarterback would play on the school's fields as a kid and starred on its football and basketball teams as a student.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Trent has worked at a number of schools in Michigan and has served as the assistant principal of Wyoming High School since 2022.\n\nAccording to the Daily Journal, Cheryl worked as a juvenile probation officer for 30 years before she retired. After saying goodbye to her decades-long career, she started working as a substitute teacher and as a receptionist for a mental health practice in Michigan.\n\n\"Cheryl’s extensive experience at the Juvenile Court has equipped her with a deep understanding of the human experience and the complexities individuals face,\" her bio reads. \"This insight allows her to address inquiries, provide information, and guide you through the process, ensuring that each person feels heard, supported, and well-informed.\"\n\nTrent and Cheryl share two sons, Tyler and Trinidad. Tyler was born first, followed by Trinidad on Aug. 24, 2002.\n\nThe couple told the Daily Journal in October 2025 that they agreed Cheryl would name their second child if they were a girl and Trent would if they were a boy. Though his wife claimed that Trinidad was named after the Spanish word for \"The Trinity,\" Trent argued that boxer Félix Trinidad inspired the moniker more.\n\n\"I kind of thought, ‘Man, this name Trinidad, boy, that sounds like a good name,’ ” he explained. “And then we ended up having the correlation of The Holy Trinity and the religious and spiritual connection, which made it even better.”\n\nTrent told the Daily Journal that his son has always been athletically gifted and \"could catch before he could walk.\" Trinidad was involved in a wide array of sports from an early age, and, according to Cheryl, he \"always had a ball in his hand.\"\n\nThough he also played soccer, baseball and basketball, Trinidad ultimately fell in love with football. Trent, who was coaching at the time, began teaching his son quarterback drills during his meetings when Trinidad was just 6 or 7 years old.\n\nHis parents recalled playfully hitting him with pool noodles during his progressions, a routine that eventually drew in a growing group of neighborhood kids for daily practices.\n\n\"Before you knew it, he had a whole team of kids, like you were watching a little Pee Wee practice or just a school team,” Cheryl told the Daily Journal. \"And Trinidad just absolutely loved it. It wasn’t something that he was forced to do, it wasn’t something that he begrudged. He thoroughly enjoyed it.”\n\nWhile Trinidad was playing at Ferris State, he would run to the fence during warmups to pray with his mother. The quarterback and his mom told the Clarion Ledger that they were able to continue their pre-game tradition even after he transferred to Ole Miss.\n\nAfter Chambliss runs out of the tunnels, he finds his mom in the stands and the two recite a prayer together.\n\n“It's been surreal and it's been amazing and we just feel it's such a blessing,\" Cheryl said, referring to her son's success at the university. \"It's been really great for people to see what we already knew about our son, that he has talent, that he has ability to lead.\"",

    "fullText": "Goodbye UFC Fight Pass, hello … VICE TV?\n\nAfter six years as an exclusive partner of UFC Fight Pass, Legacy Fighting Alliance (LFA) is moving on. The premier regional mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion has signed a new broadcast deal with VICE TV, which will air 25 LFA events in 2026.\n\nThe first card on its new platform will be LFA 224 on Fri., Jan. 16, 2026, in Prior Lake, Minnesota. The event will be headlined by Matt Adams vs. Arslan Bilalov for the vacant LFA Heavyweight title. One week later, LFA heads to Brazil for LFA 225 on Jan. 23, featuring an interim Flyweight title fight between Marcos Degli and Luis Aguiar.\n\n“We are excited to announce an exciting new partnership with VICE TV,” LFA CEO Ed Soares wrote in a press release. “The LFA’s mission has always been to showcase the sport’s top up-and-coming fighters in front of the widest audience possible. VICE has built a loyal audience that values authenticity and unfiltered, ground-level storytelling. Together, we will bring the untold stories of athletes shaping the future of the sport to a national television audience.”\n\nVICE TV has quietly expanded its footprint in combat sports over the past few years. The network debuted Dark Side of the Cage in early 2025 and currently airs BKB Bare Knuckle Boxing as well as PFL’s international events, signaling a broader push into fight programming.\n\nWhile some fans may question leaving UFC Fight Pass due to its established MMA audience, Soares believes the move will significantly increase LFA’s reach.\n\n“Before, UFC Fight Pass distributed our events worldwide through their platform,” Soares told Sherdog. “Now, we’re negotiating distribution in over 200 markets. In the U.S., VICE TV will bring LFA into 45 million homes. When you combine TV and streaming, we expect at least five times the audience.”\n\nIn markets without finalized broadcast partners — including Brazil — LFA events will stream on the promotion’s official YouTube channel.",

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Pete Nakos, Michigan defensive back Jayden Sanders plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal. Sanders is a former highly sought-after recruit but only spent one season in Ann Arbor with the Wolverines. He now hits the open market with a ton of potential and eligibility on his hands.\n\nPlaying time actually went to Sanders’ way early and often. He played in all 13 games for the Wolverines as a true freshman. A nice 23 tackles are on the stat sheet, as is one pass breakup. Michigan certainly thought they were getting a look at somebody who was going to be a major contributor in the future.\n\nSanders played high school football at Kilgore (TX), where he was a four-star prospect. He was the No. 176 overall recruit in the 2025 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.\n\nA few other local schools were after Sanders before Michigan wound up being his destination out of high school. Oklahoma State was another out-of-state program, while in-state Baylor wanted to sign the blue-chip defensive back. Another opportunity will officially present itself once Sanders pops up in the portal.\n\n“It’s been huge, man,” former Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore said of Sanders during the regular season. “I remember me and [defensive coordinator] Wink [Martindale], it was maybe the fifth or sixth day of training camp. Wink came up to me and was like, ‘That guy’s going to help us this year.’ I was like, ‘I think so.’ And it came to fruition.”\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

    "fullText": "The Wisconsin Badgers picked up a second quarterback in the transfer portal on Thursday, as Louisville Cardinals transfer Deuce Adams committed to the program after a visit, per ESPN’s Pete Thamel.\n\nAdams, a former three-star recruit in the Class of 2024, was a redshirt freshman at Louisville this past season, completing 15 of 21 passes for 112 yards as the Cardinals’ No. 2 quarterback behind senior Miller Moss.\n\nAdams started one game for Louisville this season, completing 12 of 17 passes for 94 yards in a 38-6 loss to the SMU Mustangs. He ultimately played in seven games across two seasons at Louisville. After entering the portal, the Texas native received interest from multiple programs, including the Michigan Wolverines and James Madison Dukes.\n\nHowever, those visits were scheduled after Adams’s trip to Madison on Thursday, and the redshirt freshman ultimately committed to Wisconsin on his visit. The Badgers had been interested in several younger quarterbacks as they sought a second addition in the transfer portal, including Kansas true freshman transfer David McComb, who had visited Madison earlier in the week.\n\nBut, with one spot available, Adams was the choice, committing to the program first. He becomes the fifth scholarship quarterback for the Badgers in 2025, joining Colton Joseph, Carter Smith, Danny O’Neil, and incoming freshman Ryan Hopkins.\n\nJoseph is the team’s projected starter after coming in from Old Dominion, where he was one of the country’s top dual-threat quarterbacks in 2025. Smith was the starter for Wisconsin’s final games of the season, and the Badgers were able to retain him after some conversations with the staff. He currently projects as Wisconsin’s No. 2 quarterback to start the year, with Danny O’Neil nursing his long-term injury.\n\nHopkins, a four-star recruit in the Class of 2026, will likely need some time to develop, so Adams currently slots in as the No. 3 quarterback with the chance to compete for the backup spot this season.",

However, Jones may choose to be patient as he weighs his options, particularly given uncertainty surrounding the Vikings’ defensive staff.

    "fullText": "Tonight’s Fiesta Bowl between the Miami Hurricanes and the Ole Miss Rebels will feature several players the Seattle Seahawks could draft in 2026. There’s one name in particular to watch, and several others to know.\n\nMost likely for the Seahawks to draft is Miami edge rusher Akheem Mesidor. He put the nation on watch with a dominant performance in the Cotton Bowl, helping Miami upset the defending national champion Ohio State Buckeyes. He’s been easy to overlook with the naked eye this year while playing opposite potential top-10 pick Rueben Bain on the defensive line, but is finally getting the respect he deserves. On 29 pass rush reps in the game, he garnered 6 pressures and 2 sacks. Seamocks.com blogger Jared Stanger wrote about him as a potential fit within Mike Macdonald’s defense back in November, being his lone mid-round fit at the position. Macdonald loves high-motor edge players, as evidenced by the Seahawks’ signing of DeMarcus Lawrence, and advanced pass rushers, as shown with his willingness to retain Uchenna Nwosu. Mesidor is the top draft prospect for Seahawks fans to watch tonight, and likely for the team’s scouts, too.\n\nOther names on Miami to know include tackle Francis Mauigoa (probably goes too high for Seattle to have a chance), cornerbacks Keionte Scott (who had a pick-six against Ohio State) and Ethan O’Connor (former Washington State Cougar), safety Jakobe Thomas (excellent size and ball skills could be a fit in Seahawks defense), and wide receiver CJ Daniels (could be a good complement to receiving corps next season).\n\nI wrote about Rueben Bain earlier in the season, but his draft stock is sky-high and the Seahawks draft pick will be late. There has been some polarizing discussion about his arm length, since there hasn’t ever been a Pro Bowl-caliber NFL edge rusher with as short of arms as him. However, there also hasn’t ever been one in college with that lack of arm length. Bain is already an anomaly and is too dominant to overlook, but he’ll be polarizing among fans and league circles alike. Some teams who value length more will have him graded as a second-round pick, but enough teams will fall in love with him that he should still go in the top half of the first round.\n\nOle Miss’ isn’t as loaded for the 2026 draft, more towards 2027. Their possible Seahawks come late April include linebacker Suntarine Perkins (could be a Tyrice Knight-esque build should they decide to add depth), cornerback Antonio Kite (likely Day 3 cornerback), wide receivers De’Zhaun Stribling (another former WSU Cougar) and Cayden Lee (underrated receiver due to size with great hands and route-running technique), and edge rusher Princewill Umanmielen (brother Princely was drafted to the Carolina Panthers last year).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Potential 2026 Seahawks in CFP Semifinal between Miami and Ole Miss",

He had been with the team for 18 seasons with an overall record of 193-124, including a Super Bowl win. Harbaugh has been one of the most consistent coaches in the NFL for a while, so parting ways with him is awfully risky for the Ravens; the grass isn't always greener on the other side.\n\nCleveland.com's Browns Insider Mary Kay Cabot is reporting that the Browns are \"definitely doing their diligence\" on Harbaugh and that you can expect Cleveland to be on his list of interviews when he starts interviewing next week. This would be a slam dunk for the Browns if they could bring in Harbaugh to replace Kevin Stefanski as the team's head coach.\n\nThe Browns are casting a wide net, trying to find the right head coach to finally turn things around consistently and make them legitimate contenders.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns could be desired destination of former Ravens HC John Harbaugh",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nQuarterback Daniel Jones’ future with the Indianapolis Colts will be a main topic of conversation this offseason.\n\nJones was having a very solid season for the Colts before suffering a torn Achilles in Week 14. Given that he was on the last year of his contract, the injury raised some serious questions regarding the future of the 28-year-old QB in Indianapolis. Did the Colts still think he could be their guy moving forward? Would they look to go in a different direction?\n\nColts general manager Chris Ballard answered some of those questions at his second-ending news conference, and his comments sure made it sound like the teams plans to bring him back.\n\n\"I'm looking at him both near and long [term],\" Ballard said of Jones. \"When you're chasing the quarterback all the time, it makes it very hard. Your margin for error really shrinks down. And I feel very good about Daniel Jones and where he's at, where he's going. Yes, he's got the Achilles. But I think Daniel Jones has got a really bright future here in Indianapolis.\"\n\nEven with the Achilles injury, Jones will likely have other suitors in free agency given the lack of quarterback depth in the class. However, he has recently indicated that he would like to remain in Indianapolis.\n\n\"I've enjoyed being here, working with the coaching staff here, the players,\" Jones said. \"I think it's a great organization and I've enjoyed being here. Obviously there's a business side to it and understand that, but I've really enjoyed being here around these people.\"\n\nJones also doesn't think that the injury will impact his availability for next season, no matter where he plays.\n\n\"But I expect to be ready to go by training camp,\" Jones said. \"We'll attack the process and make sure I'm ready to go.\"\n\nJones is headed for unrestricted free agency in March, but he could potentially come to an agreement on a new deal with the Colts before then.",

    "fullText": "CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Browns opened their head coach search on Thursday by interviewing defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz and offensive coordinator Tommy Rees.\n\nGeneral manager Andrew Berry had said he would consider both coordinators for the opening. The Browns fired Kevin Stefanski on Monday after six seasons and a 36-58 overall mark. Stefanski was a two-time AP NFL Coach of the Year, but Cleveland had a 8-26 mark the past two seasons.\n\nSchwartz, 59, has head coaching experience, leading the Detroit Lions from 2009 through 2013. He had a 29-52 overall record and led the Lions to the playoffs in 2011, three seasons after they were the first NFL team to go 0-16.\n\nSchwartz has been the architect of one of the league's top defenses the last three seasons. Cleveland led the league in total defense in 2023 and ranked fourth this season as Myles Garrett recorded 23 sacks and broke the NFL single-season record.\n\n“Jim’s an outstanding football coach. We have a lot of respect for him, a lot of appreciation for him, and he has certainly earned the right for consideration,” Berry said.\n\nSafety Grant Delpit and other defensive players are hoping Schwartz will remain, either as head coach or coordinator.\n\n“I think it goes without saying what kind of coach he is and the energy he brings. I think coach Schwartz is going to be a great, still-got-it type of head coach. He’s a fiery guy and I’d vouch for him,” Delpit said. “I think that he’s taken our defense and brought it to an elite level and kept it there.”\n\nRees came to Cleveland in 2024 as tight ends coach and pass game specialist before being promoted to offensive coordinator this season. He had play-calling responsibilities for the final nine games and was credited along with quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave for Shedeur Sanders' development during his seven games as the starter.\n\nRees was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Alabama in 2023 under Nick Saban after six seasons at Notre Dame. He was quarterbacks coach at his alma mater from 2017-22 and added offensive coordinator duties in 2020.\n\n“He’s a very talented young coordinator. He’s held in very high regard, not just in college football, but across the NFL,” Berry said.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "While wrestlers keep in shape, wrestling itself is anything but pretty. Jacy Jayne was an WWE upstart's reminder of that reality.",
    "fullText": "While wrestlers go to great lengths to condition their bodies, tidy up their appearance, and maintain their brand, wrestling itself is anything but pretty. WWE Women's EVOLVE Champion Kendal Grey learned that the hard way when a sharp knee strike to the face from reigning \"NXT\" Women's Champion Jacy Jayne sent the young upstart to the dentist. Other champions might have sent flowers to Grey's resting bed, but Jayne, instead, took to social media to welcome Grey to the lifestyle.\n\n\"Welcome to the biz kid,\" Jayne wrote simply.\n\nMidday Thursday, Jayne reposted and responded to Grey's tooth-related call-out post. In Grey's original post, the WWE EVOLVE Women's Champion posted a clip of the fateful knee to the jaw that sent her to the nearest dentist's office, and tagged Jayne's social media account in her caption. While the extent of Grey's tooth injury is unclear, the \"NXT\" upstart nevertheless promised to return the favor to Jayne in the future, prompting Jayne's snarky response. As of writing, Jayne's remark has surpassed nearly 8,000 views on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWelcome to the biz kid https://t.co/0Lk6AJk0ZF\n\n— Jacy Jayne (@jacyjaynewwe) January 8, 2026\n\nFans were vocal with support under Jayne's post, with a leading comment calling Jayne \"one of the best knee strikers in the game.\" Others praised Jayne for her dominant \"NXT\" run, while several netizens called Jayne \"mother,\" a term of endearment in queer and Gen Z online spaces. Grey has yet to respond to Jayne's comments.\n\nThe strike that sent Grey to the dentist's chair office comes from her \"NXT\" Women's Championship match at Tuesday's New Years Evil event, where she unsuccessfully challenged for Jayne's title in an contest full of vicious strikes, top-rope moves, and Fatal Influence interference. If rumors are true, however, Grey may not have long to score payback on Jayne, as rumors of a main roster call-up for the Fatal Influence leader run rampant.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

I'm fit and back on court, but 5-setters are a different beast and I'm not quite ready to go the distance yet. This tournament means everything to me, but I'd rather give my spot to someone who's ready to make their moment count. It's all building blocks and I'll be back next year and pumped to compete. See you out there.\"\n\nKyrgios is from Canberra, Australia, so he obviously values this tournament highly.\n\nThis year, he'll just have to make the most of it in the doubles bracket.\n\nMORE: Chloe Kim injury update is bad news for the Olympics",

He’s spent the past two seasons with the Nittany Lions, appearing in five games as a true freshman in 2024 before appearing in all 13 games during the 2025 campaign.\n\nThis season, Gilliam began to have a more significant impact along the defensive front. He tallied 15 tackles, 2.0 tackles for a loss and 0.5 sacks. He started two games.\n\nPrior to enrolling at Penn State, Gilliam was ranked as a three-star prospect and the No. 741 overall recruit in the 2023 class, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking. He also checked in as the No. 63 defensive lineman in the class and the No. 25 overall player from the state of Maryland, hailing from Gaithersburg (MD) Quince Orchard.\n\nHe was rated as a four-star prospect in the On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings. He was the No. 67 overall recruit, and the No. 6 overall defensive lineman available after entering their name into the portal before committing to a new beginning.\n\nIn high school, Gilliam was a three-year letterman and had an outstanding senior campaign. His team finished with an 11-1 record and Gilliam earned first-team All-Metro honors as a result.\n\nFormer LSU offensive lineman Ory Williams has committed to Tennessee, via the NCAA Transfer Portal, according to On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Williams spent two seasons at LSU.\n\nWilliams made 12 appearances and two starts in the 2025 campaign for the Tigers. As a true freshman, Williams played in just one game before ultimately redshirting. He has three years of eligibility remaining.\n\nOry Williams played high school football at San Marcos (TX), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 460 overall player and No. 30 offensive tackle in the 2024 recruiting cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Rankings.\n\nWilliams only played two years of high school football and quickly rose up the national ranks. At 6-foot-8, 335 pounds, Williams boasts professional size. As of this report, he is the No. 38 offensive tackle in On3’s 2026 Transfer Portal Player Rankings.\n\nWilliams visited Tennessee on Sunday. The Texas native spoke highly of the Volunteers’ coaching staff following his visit.",

Earlier in the day, Iran severed all IPv6 connectivity when the country withdrew all of its IPv6 BGP routes at 11:49 UTC (3:19pm local). At 16:30 UTC (8pm local), traffic volumes into the country began a steady descent until the last remaining pieces of connectivity were disabled a little more than an hour ago.\n\nThe internet shutdown marks an ominous development for the situation in Iran, echoing the November 2019 protests (also known as Bloody November), which featured a similar national internet blackout and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Iranians.\n\nDoug Madory is the director of internet analysis for Kentik where he works on internet infrastructure analysis. The Washington Post dubbed him “The Man who can see the Internet” for his reputation in identifying significant developments in the global layout of the internet.

I’m Ron Minsky. It is my\ngreat pleasure to introduce Richard Eisenberg. Richard’s a senior\ncontributor to the Haskell ecosystem. He’s worked on Haskell’s type\nsystem in a lot of different ways over the last eight years. He’s on\nthe GHC Steering Committee. He’s the Chair of the Haskell\nFoundation. One might wonder, what’s he doing here? Well, it turns out\nRichard has joined Jane Street. He’s working on our Tools and\nCompilers team, and in particular, working on the team that works on\nthe front end of the OCaml compiler. So, thanks for joining me,\nRichard.\n\nSo, maybe a good place to start out with is to talk about your\nbackground. You’ve done all this exciting work in the Haskell\necosystem. Maybe tell us a little bit more about how you got involved\nin Haskell and what kind of work you’ve done there.\n\nYeah, sure. I first really encountered Haskell when I went back to\ngraduate school. I’d been a high school teacher for a little while and\nthen I thought, ‘oh, you know, it’s time to get a Ph.D. in programming\nlanguages,’ kind of, as you do.\n\nIn the process toward that, I discovered dependent types. I didn’t\nwanna just show up in grad school and not know anything. So I did some\nbackground reading and I discovered that, you know, these fancy type\nsystems have so much expressiveness, and so much of a way of being\nable to sort of define what it is that you’re programming before you\neven write a line of code, that you can just express your ideas so\nmuch more clearly and then get the compiler to check that you actually\ndid it correctly. This was just sort of, you know, my brain exploded\nwhen I learned about this.\n\nI feel like, you know, I kind of pretend to know something about\nprogramming languages on TV, but like, actually my academic background\nis distributed systems, not programming languages, and there’s lots of\ngaps in my knowledge. And so, I kinda don’t really know what dependent\ntypes are. Can you give a suitably beginner-friendly explanation of\nwhat dependent types are?\n\nSure. And I’m gonna start by avoiding the trap of trying to define the\nterm, ‘dependent type.’\n\nAnd instead, just sort of describe ‘a language with dependent types\nallows you to do this thing.’ And that thing is to essentially encode\na proof of correctness into your program such that every time you\ncompile your program, that proof is checked. And so you know—if you’ve\nset things up the right way—that your program does what you think it\ndoes. And so, I’ll give a concrete example.\n\nAnd that is, to imagine a sorting function. So normally we think of a\nsorting function, let’s just say, it’s a function from a list of\n‘ints’ to a list of ints, right? It takes this list of ints’ input,\nand then does some transformation, and then produces a list. But\nactually, that’s a very loose description of a sorting function. We\ncan do better than that.\n\nI wanna say that a sorting function takes in a list of ints, and it\nproduces a list of ints in, I’m gonna say, non-descending order\n(because maybe there’s duplicates, so I don’t want to say ‘ascending\norder’ because someone out there might say that’s wrong). So we get\nthis list out that’s in non-descending order. Okay, that’s closer, but\nthat’s still not quite right because maybe my function just always\nreturned to the empty list. That’s a list in non-descending order.\n\nSo instead, I really want to say that it’s a function that takes in a\nlist of ints, and returns a result that is in non-descending order,\nand is a permutation of the input list. And that’s a rather glorious\ntype that I can assign to a sorting function. But it accurately\ndescribes what that sorting function does.\n\nAnd then I can implement that in any number of ways, using any of the\ncommon sorting algorithms that you learn in computer science, and any\nof those different algorithms will meet that specification, and then,\nif I’ve encoded this, my compiler will check that my algorithm\nactually does sorting and doesn’t do some other thing. And so now,\nhaving sort of explained that, I can return back and actually say what\nI mean by ‘dependent type.’\n\nA dependent type is a type that can depend on some input that you give\ninto a function, essentially. So, in this case, the output of the\nfunction, not just a list of ints, but the output depends on the\ninput. The output must be a permutation of the input. And so, that’s\nthe dependent type.\n\nSo when I started grad school, then I saw Haskell, and here was a\nlanguage that had this fancy type system and had all this\nexpressiveness. Didn’t quite have dependent types, but it had a lot of\nthat stuff. That just got me excited. And then, through that I started\nworking with Stephanie Weirich at University of Pennsylvania. She was\ndoing a lot of Haskell work. She collaborated a bunch with Simon\nPeyton Jones, who then I started collaborating with, and things just\nsort of took off from there. It was a pretty fast introduction into\nthat world.\n\nI wanna go a little deeper on that. I feel like we’ve started with\nthe, like, ‘Well, of course I got a Ph.D. in PL and was interested in\ndependent types.’ Like, how do you even get there? Where does your\ninterest and background in programming languages come [from] in the\nfirst place?\n\nSo, once upon a time, I wanted to program. I don’t know why I wanted\nto program. I was too little to have that level of introspection.\n\nSo I guess, uh, I learned Basic when I was, I think, five\nsomehow. There was a friend of my parents that decided I should learn\nBasic and so that happened.\n\nBut I then got more into it, I guess, when I was in 7th grade, so this\nwas, probably I was 12 years old. And someone told me that Pascal was\na good language to learn. So, you know, I pleaded with my parents and\neventually they bought me the Pascal compiler ‘cause back in those\ndays, you actually had to pay for compilers. At least on, sort of—we\nhad a Macintosh. If I had some kind of Unix system, maybe it would’ve\nbeen different.\n\nWell, which Pascal compiler did you use?\n\nUm, THINK Pascal? Was that a thing?\n\nTHINK Pascal, so not Borland. I guess Borland was \nDOS side of the world.\n\nYeah, yeah. Borland, yes, Borland was for like, ‘real programmers.’\n\nSo I got this, and somewhere along the way, I had decided that every\npiece of software should be, like, if you read the instruction manual,\nthat should tell you everything you need to know about that piece of\nsoftware. I don’t know why I assumed that, but that was my starting\npoint. And so, it came with these two big books and most of the books\nwere just like on compiler flags and setting up projects and none of\nthis stuff about programming. At the end of one of the books was a\nsyntax reference with no glosses, no further information, just a\nsyntax reference using those, sort of, block and line diagrams to\nrepresent recursive loops in the syntax. And I was like, ‘Okay, well,\nif my assumption is that this book defines how to program, and this is\nthe only thing it has, then all the information must be here.’\n\nSo I just stared at these syntax diagrams probably for hours and\nhours. Like, ‘Okay, what does all of this mean?’ And then eventually\nsort of bootstrapped my way into learning how to program Pascal. And\nso, that being my first ‘real programming experience,’ somehow that\nbuilt the structures in my brain just around syntax and languages, and\nit kind of went from there.\n\nAnd then fast-forward 10 years or so, and I took a PL course as an\nundergrad from Norman Ramsey and it just lit me up. It was just like,\nthis is really cool stuff. I really enjoy this kind of thinking. And\nit turned out, I took that at the end of my senior year of undergrad,\nand so it was sort of too late to immediately go into grad school at\nthat point and I had this whole machine going toward high school\nteaching. So I did that for a while, but then I ended up returning.\n\nI love that your entrée into programming was, roughly speaking, a\ntraumatic experience with syntax. That seems… (laughs)\n\nBut it wasn’t traumatic. It was fantastic. Somehow, this was just what\nI needed. This was what my 12-year-old-self needed: big syntax blocks.\n\n(laughs) Okay. So, you went off, you got your Ph.D., you started\nworking on Haskell. Where did it go from there?\n\nWell, I was working on my Ph.D. It was basically, Stephanie and I had\nthis idea about how to encode dependent types, but it required some\nmore support from the Haskell compiler. And so, I was pleading [with]\nthe Haskell people to create this for me. And then, eventually Simon\njust wrote and said, ‘Why don’t you just do it?’ And that was a new\nconcept for me. I was like, ‘I could influence this language? Well,\nyou know, I’m just this random person.’\n\nBut between Stephanie and Simon mentoring me, I got to a point where I\ncould contribute and then it just grew from there. So, [I] did a bunch\nof that as a Ph.D. student. Then after leaving my Ph.D., I was a\nprofessor for a few years at Bryn Mawr College. What was great about\nthat experience was, they were open to the idea that open source\ncontributions were a form of publication, right? A lot of professors\nhave a lot of pressure to keep producing papers. That was definitely\nthere for me, too. But alongside papers, I couldn’t just do\nsoftware. But I could do, sort of, traditional scholarly publications\nand software. So that gave me a chance to continue my implementation\nwork, remain a part of this open source community, while still doing\nthe high-level scholarly research that I had been doing. So that was a\nreally nice part of it.\n\nIt turned out that, to my great surprise, that—well, this wasn’t to my\ngreat surprise—it turned out that this was a lot of work. That\nmaintaining a research program with a bunch of papers every year, and\ndoing these open source contributions, and teaching, there was just\nmore than could comfortably fit into one job, especially during term\ntime. And to my own surprise, I realized that the teaching part was\nthe part that maybe I could pause on. I had done that full-time as a\nhigh school teacher for eight years, now I was back doing it. It was\nfun, but I thought it was time to sort of push in a slightly different\ndirection.\n\nSo after a couple years at Bryn Mawr, I left to join Tweed which is a\nsoftware consultancy based in Paris. They do a ton of Haskell\nwork. And they hired me, basically just to continue my contributions\nin the Haskell space. So, I continued doing research there, continued\ncontributing to the compiler there. And, you know, after a few years\nof that, that was fun, and I got to a point where I was looking to be\npart of a cohesive team all working together, and realizing that after\nso many years just working in one language, I was really ready to see\nwhat things were like in a different space. And so the timing worked\nout really well when you, Ron, reached out to me and started the\ndiscussions that led to me joining Jane Street.\n\nRight. And often in these interviews, I’ll ask someone, like, ‘so how\ndid you get here?’ But actually, I was part of the dramatis personae\nof how you actually arrived.\n\nYou were the—the dramatis personae, yeah. (laughs)\n\n(laughs) Right, which is, at some point, I was like, ‘oh, it would be\nreally good if Richard worked here,’ and I started reaching out and\ntrying to convince you to come. Which took, it’s important, I\ncalculated, 11 months from (laughs) when I started.\n\nYeah, yeah. That’s right. I mean, you know, of course the story [of]\nme coming to Jane Street starts with you asking me, and me saying\n‘No.’\n\nAnd again, it was a matter of timing. I’ve been aware of Jane Street\nfor a long time, been sort of wondering what was happening over there,\nand somehow when you first reached out, it just wasn’t the right time\nfor me yet. And then the second time, it was sort of a better time. I\ncouldn’t even tell you why. It’s just, this is the way that life\nflows.\n\nBut, you know, one of the barriers which we’ve joked about is that I\ngrew up in the New York area and actually ended up going to high\nschool in New York and commuting from New Jersey. So every day I was\ngoing back and forth across the George Washington Bridge, and swore to\nmyself then that I would never commute to and from New York City. And\nalso just sort of had this negative vibe from the financial industry,\nand I was just like, ‘I don’t know. Like, I want to be creating\nsomething that other people use,’ right?\n\nBut actually, this is fantastic. I’m having great fun. Part of it is\nthat I’m working as part of this larger ecosystem. It’s not just a\nclosed thing where I’m only doing stuff that’s internal to Jane\nStreet. But instead, contributing to this open source ecosystem,\nworking on an open language, OCaml, and really continuing some of\nthese research trends that I started 10 years ago. Now that I’m here,\nit just all fits very naturally together.\n\nI feel like, in general, one of my takeaways is that there’s lots of\ninteresting work in lots of different places and the preconceptions\nyou have when you are young often (laughs) don’t work out over\ntime. So a thing you talked about earlier is a topic that I feel like\nI should know something about, but don’t. I like your first high-level\ndescription ‘cause it actually lines up with the very little bit I\nknow about dependent types.\n\nAnd there’s also something that’s always made me a little nervous\nabout them because a basic fact about proofs is—proofs seem pretty\nhard to construct. People go to great trouble to build automated\nproving systems where you have tactic libraries, like, little tiny\nprograms that you can run to, like, ‘try this way or try that way’ of\ncoming up with a proof of a thing. And it all sounds really hard and\nwhen you talk to people who do kind of theorem proving on large scale\nsoftware systems, it sounds like a pretty challenging operation where\nthis is kind of a lot of engineering work that just goes into just\nconstructing the proof. So I’m curious how you think of the\npracticalities of that? Like, how convenient can you make it? And if\nyou make it a deeply embedded part of the programming process, does\nthat work well with the other things you might wanna do? Does it\ninterfere with the ordinary process of programming? How do you see the\npragmatics of that working out?\n\nYeah, that’s a great question. And this is a question that doesn’t\nhave an answer yet. This is, I think, still something that the\nprogramming languages community is grappling with. I have my own\ntakes, but this is still sort of an open question out there.\n\nI think, first of all, that for a programming language to be\neffective, everything needs to be opt-in, right? If you have a\nlanguage that supports dependent types—and there’s a bunch out\nthere. So actually, OCaml’s module system is a dependent type\nsystem. It’s missing one or two key features that makes it really sort\nof go. But that definitely has aspects of dependent types in\nit. Haskell has aspects of dependent types.\n\nThere are other languages, Coq, Agda, Idris, Lean, these are the ones\nthat really have embraced dependent types. But in any of these\nlanguages, you don’t have to use these dependent types. You can just\nwrite a sorting function that is described as ‘a list of ints to a\nlist of ints.’ That’s fine. And I think that’s a key aspect of any\nkind of system that’s gonna be using this dependent types feature,\nbecause not everyone wants to prove everything all the time. As you\nsay, proofs are expensive. And so, what you need is, you need the\nability to only prove the parts that you think are worthwhile proving.\n\nSo let’s say we have an important part of the system that might be\neasy to get wrong that we want to prove something about. How do we do\nthat? Is that still worth it? And one thing to think about is, what’s\nyour cost-benefit analysis, right? If you do this proving, can you\nspend less time on testing? Can you spend less time on debugging? Can\nyou spend less time on catastrophic failure because you missed\nsomething when debugging?\n\nIt is a lot harder to do these programs with proofs. But sometimes,\nthat’s really worth it. It’s a matter of applying good taste, like it\nis everywhere in programming, right? Any programming language gives\nyou a ton of tools to work with, and it takes time and experience and\ntaste to figure out when it’s time to use which tools.\n\nRight. And I do really like that, kind of, pay-as-you-go kind of\nattitude of, like, you want some kind of base language that’s\nrelatively simple to work with, and then the ability to add on more\nfeatures that give you more power of various kinds, and not be forced\nto pay for that complexity constantly in everything you do. Which is,\nI think, actually a really hard thing to get right in the design—of\nlike, not having these more powerful features leak in and corrupt the\nrest of your experience within the language.\n\nThat’s right. It’s a very careful thing. And my push in Haskell has\nbeen to try to increase or add new features to help support dependent\ntypes, and there’s been a large community of people really excited for\nthis. And in my measurement, my biased measurement, a smaller\ncommunity of people who have been saying, ‘No, no, no. Don’t do this\nbecause it’s gonna make it impossible to write simple programs.’ And\nmany, many, many times, I’ve had to reassure people, ‘No, no. All\nthose simple programs will continue to exist, they’ll continue to\nwork. You can do what you want.’ But I also wanna give power to people\nwho want to use the fancy dependent types.\n\nGreat. Okay. So let’s leave Haskell and dependent types behind for the\nmoment because that’s not primarily what you’re working on here. Maybe\nyou can tell us, what are you working on here? Like, what is the\nmission that you are on here, working on OCaml?\n\nSo, I’ll start more broadly and then I’ll get narrower. My broad\nmission is my belief that type systems are a fantastic way to\nstructure thought and structure programs. So by being able to write\ndown what you intend to do before doing it, then you can check what\nyou’ve done, and you can also help formulate your thoughts. And when I\nsay, ‘write down what you intend to do before doing it,’ I mean, write\ndown a specification in types.\n\nThe flip side of that, is that it must be the case that you can do\nthat without paying a one-time cost. It’s gonna be problematic if you\nwant to write an efficient program, and yet, by defining your program\ncarefully ahead of time, now it’s no longer as efficient at\nruntime. This checking and this writing of a specification should all\nhappen at compile time. This should be happening in front of the\nprogrammer and not in front of any users. If any of those details leak\ninto user land by slowing your program down or somehow interfering\nwith the operation of your program, then there’s a misdesign in the\nlanguage.\n\nSo coming down to what I’m actually working on here at Jane Street, so\nthe feature I’m working on is something called unboxed types. There’s\nvarious different ways of characterizing it, but one way to do so is,\nit allows inlining of type definitions. So what we might want to have\nin our design is to have a structure that has four fields that\ndescribe some aspects of a trade. And then maybe we store that\nstructure in some larger structure, and maybe that’s stored in some\nlarger structure.\n\nWell, if you do that the naïve way in OCaml, every time you store one\nstructure inside of another, it’s stored by a pointer. And it means\nnow when I wanna access the price of this trade that’s all the way\ndown (it’s a nested structure) I have to follow this pointer, then\nthat pointer, then that pointer, then that pointer, each time I have a\ncache miss, each time I have to load into memory. This is really bad.\n\nRight. And this highlights a kind of basic fact about OCaml, that it\nhas a very fancy, at least on the scale of modern language that people\nmight use, a very fancy type system and a brutally simple memory\nrepresentation. OCaml’s internal implementation might have been like a\nScheme or Lisp written in the mid-‘60s or something, which is to say,\neverything looks like either some immediate value, it’s no bigger than\na word that fits in a register, or a heap-allocated value, which is\nlike one header word and then one full word for every slot inside of\nit, and we have all the fancy, like, type goo on top of it that you\nwant, but all of the physical representation looks just like that.\n\nExactly. Exactly. It means that we’re building this beautiful type\ndiscipline in our software to try to avoid errors, and try to express\nourselves, and try to communicate more clearly among developers—and\nwe’re paying for that at runtime! This is ridiculous. To me, every\ntime a type system feature slows down your program or otherwise\ninterferes is just a misdesign. And so, the fact that this is our\ncurrent state of play is problematic. The task I’m working on is\ncoming up with a new design for OCaml’s type system, or this aspect of\nOCaml’s type system, that allows us to have this rich type structure\nwithout paying for it at runtime.\n\nThat’s right. Although it’s not that you can pick a type structure\nthat’s kind of oblivious to the performance details, right? In some\nsense it’s the opposite. The idea of the unboxed type work and a lot\nof the work that we’re doing now is really about taking design\ndecisions that have to do with performance and making them explicit at\nthe level of types.\n\nYes, that’s right. Because you can’t, I mean, in the end, we need to\nexecute this somehow. There needs to be an execution model. And so, if\nwe try to ignore all of these execution details in the type system,\nthen there’s not gonna be a way of making it fast. And so, the work\nis, in some sense, taking some of these execution-oriented details,\nmaking them manifest in the type system, getting programmers the\nability to write types that take these into account, so that we can\nthen execute fast.\n\nRight. In some sense, I think of this as really being about enabling\nperformance engineering, right? There’s kind of two different lines of\npeople thinking about how to optimize programs via compilers. One is,\nyou make your compiler smarter so it can do more and optimize things\nfor you. So the user can write kind of an ordinary program that just\nreflects, ‘what do they want to achieve and what’s the logical\nstructure,’ and then the compiler will, like, do something good. And\nthen, the other direction is trying to give a lot of precise\nunderstanding to the programmer so they can know exactly what they’re\ndoing and they can optimize their program. And these are both\nimportant.\n\nBut, like, in some sense the scale of optimizations are very\ndifferent. Like, if you come up with a way of making your compiler\nfaster that, like, takes most user programs and makes them 20% faster,\nthat’s an enormous win. Like, that’s a shockingly good\noutcome. Whereas, if you give people good performance engineering\ntools, the idea that they can think hard about a particular program\nand make it five, or 10, or 100 times faster is like, in some sense,\ntotally normal. And so, there’s a kind of extra power of giving\nindividuals the ability to optimize. It obviously misses out on scope\nand there’s something great about being able to go and in one swell\nfoop (laughs) make 20 different, or 100 different, or all the\ndifferent programs faster. But you can’t get the same kind of order of\nmagnitude of improvements that you can get from giving one programmer\nthe ability to really carefully engineer their system.\n\nWell, there’s a real tension because what in the end we’re doing in\nprogramming languages is, we’re trying to find a way for humans to\ncommunicate precisely to computers. And we have at our disposal our\ntool, one of our tools is the fact that this is happening on a\ncomputer. So we can write computer programs to try to sort of help\ncover this distance, right?\n\nIn the early days, humans were just completely at a disadvantage and\nthe humans wrote in assembly code. And this was kind of terrible. And\nwe’ve come some way since then, and so now instead of writing sort of\ninstruction-by-instruction that’s gonna be executed by the processor,\nwe can write in a high-level language and have a compiler translate\nthat high-level language to something that the computer can\nexecute. Hopefully along the way, it can actually make that\nfaster. But sometimes, we’ve gotten ourselves sort of too\nhigh-level. If we abstract away too many of the details of execution,\nit’s exactly as you were saying. It means that the programmer can no\nlonger do the performance engineering. And so, we need to expose just\nenough to the programmer so that now there’s some more details that\nthey can think about. Now they can do that performance engineering.\n\nBut still, I think the burden sits on the compiler to take those few\nhints that the programmer gives to make blazingly fast code come out\nthe other end. And it’s just really about this interplay between how\nmany details do we wanna expose? Certainly not all the details because\nthat’s too hard for the programmer. But we need to expose some. And\nso, it’s about, over time, programming languages developing more and\nmore features that sort of figure out the right line and the right\nbalance between this desire for high-level languages, closer to human\nthought, and low-level details, easier to execute.\n\nSo, before when we were talking about dependent types, we were talking\nabout how it’s important to have this kind of pay-as-you-go\nphenomenon, like, it gets harder as you try and get more power. It\nfeels like the same kind of thing shows up here.\n\nSo, when you try and get more control over the shape of data in the\nway that you described, what are the trade-offs? And how do you think\nabout designing the language in such a way that you don’t have\nwhatever extra complexity is there infect everything that you do?\n\nWell, we have to be really careful. So, with unboxed types, one of the\nchallenges is gonna be that unboxed types interfere with\npolymorphism. So, in a language like OCaml, you can write a function,\nsay, that computes the length of a list. And that’s gonna work over a\nlist, no matter what the list contains. And so the way that we say\nthat, is that in the type of the length function, there’s a type\nvariable. We say that it’s an ‘alpha list’ where alpha can stand for\nany type that you might wanna put in there. Once we introduce unboxed\ntypes, that no longer works out. Some of these types won’t be suitable\nreplacements for alpha. And so it means that, by having these unboxed\ntypes in the system, now this really powerful feature of polymorphism\nbecomes constrained. And so, algorithms that people are used to being\nable to use everywhere, no longer work so well.\n\nSo one of the challenges that we have is, how can we recover that? How\ncan we still keep this nice feature of polymorphism and without having\nunboxed types interfere? And so, one of the things that we’re thinking\nabout doing is some amount of essentially what could become runtime\ncode generation. It comes down to building experience with the\nfeature. As we start understanding this language feature better, we’re\ngoing to create programs using these unboxed types, recognize areas in\nwhich the current programming paradigms that we engage in no longer\nwork, and then figure out ways around them. It’s this give and take as\nwe’re doing the language design.\n\nAnd just to focus in on this code generation thing for a second, the\nbasic issue here is that the way you make in OCaml today, separate\ncompilation of work, and make the ability to write a function in one\nplace and use it polymorphically on lots of different types is, again,\nyou’re just kind of taking advantage of this rock stupid memory\nrepresentation. Like, what’s a list? A list is a collection of\nheap-allocated values, every one has, like, two slots. One is a place\nto put the data and the other is a place to have a pointer to the next\nthing on the list. And when you iterate over it, that thing always has\nthe same shape, it always has the same number of bytes, and so you\ncould just write one piece of code that kind of uniformly walks over\nit. And what happens in the unboxed types world is, suddenly you want\nthe system to contemplate multiple different possible shapes of the\ndata. And so, kind of at a mechanical level, you need different\nmachine instructions in order to do the walking of the data structure,\ndepending on what that structure is.\n\nAnd so, that’s how you might end up with wanting code generations. The\nway to kind of claw back the polymorphism is to generate the\ncode. Maybe you can generate the extra code at compile time, maybe you\nhave to generate the extra code at runtime. But you somehow now have\nto generate code for multiple different scenarios that essentially\nrepresent different physical shapes of the data.\n\nExactly. And right now, our best thought is that this will happen at\ncompile time, that we’ll be able to figure out what code we need to\ngenerate at compile time. That will prevent a few programming idioms\nthat someone might potentially want. I don’t think anyone will ever\nwant those (laughs) idioms in practice so I think we’ll be able to get\naway with it. But it does mean we’re thinking carefully about this\ndesign and it’s a hard thing. I’m not aware of another language that’s\nreally tackled the problem in the way that we expect to tackle it over\nthe next few months.\n\nSo another language I think is interesting to compare to, in all of\nthis, is Rust.\n\nSo Rust is a language which tries really hard to do two things at the\nsame time which are not trivial to do at the same time. One is to give\nstronger sense of type safety so that you can write programs that\nyou’re confident aren’t going to crash, so you get lots of protection\nfrom bugs from the type system. And also give the user a lot of\ncontrol over low-level details over how memory is managed. And we’re\nessentially trying to push OCaml in some sense at that high level of\ndescription in the same direction.\n\nHow do you think the Rust approach differs from the approach you see\nus trying to take with OCaml?\n\nThis is a good comparison. This takes us a little bit away from\nunboxed types and polymorphism because I think the way that that\nappears in Rust is quite different. But the notion of this sort of\nfiner level of control is definitely accurate. But Rust gives up\nsomething really big to do what they do. They give up garbage\ncollection. Within Jane Street and generally in programming, I think a\nlot of the time garbage collection is fantastic, right? It allows us\nto program without worrying about these low-level details that for\nmost programs, we don’t need to.\n\nSo, for instance, when I’m writing the OCaml compiler—which is written\nin OCaml, of course—I do want it to be performant, but I don’t really\ncare about microsecond latency. And so, I’m happy to write my compiler\nin a way that allocates a bunch of memory and then when it’s done with\nthat memory, the garbage collector comes and gets rid of it. This is\nreally, really convenient. In Rust, we don’t have that. In Rust, we\nare forced to think about memory, allocation, and deallocation at\nevery point in time. And this gives us this fine level of control, but\nit comes at a real cost, and it means now we’re sort of fighting\nagainst this ‘pay-as-you-go principle’ that we were talking about\nearlier. In Rust, for memory, you don’t pay as you go. Everyone has to\npay all the time for Rust fine memory control. So we wanna keep the\nhigh-level, garbage-collected OCaml for most applications, and then\nwhen we really want to have this fine level of control, we wanna have\nthat, too.\n\nAnd so, some of the work that we’re doing is around adding that finer\nlevel of control, but just where we need it.\n\nSo, one thing I wonder is whether this pay-as-you-go principle really\napplies in general or whether it’s like itself a kind of trade-off? I\nthink, if you’d asked the question of like, ‘well we should think of\ntypes in general as pay-as-you-go.’ Maybe your baseline should be by\ndefault untyped, and then when you want some extra control, you should\nadd types to it and lock it down more.\n\nThat seems in principle reasonable. But all the languages that I’ve\ndealt with that have pay-as-you-go types or what you might call\ngradual type systems, actually inherit quite a lot of complexity and\nproblems from that choice. It’s often simpler and better, at least for\nsome kinds of problems, to have a uniform approach where you sort of\nfigure out what trade-offs you wanna do and you kind of apply those\ntrade-offs uniformly. And I think, at least from my perspective, the\nbase choice you make in a language like Haskell or OCaml of like,\n‘actually, even though it has some ups and downs, we’re just going to\nhave types everywhere and that’s just how it’s gonna be,’ I think is\nat least a reasonable place in the trade off space of designs.\n\nAnd I wonder if the same is true about this kind of thing about\npay-as-you-go control? Whereas, I can imagine for some kinds of\napplications, you would want the property that, ‘yeah, I am explicit\nabout memory everywhere. I kind of have a hard guarantee that anywhere\nI look I have all of this extra information.’ I don’t know. How do you\nthink about this question of where pay-as-you-go is the right way or\nthe wrong way to think about designing something?\n\nI think that’s a great question and I agree. I mean, pay-as-you-go\ntypes, people have wanted that for some time. It hasn’t ever really\nhappened. And, I mean, you could almost say that C++ and C have\npay-as-you-go types and that they have type systems, but the type\nsystems are sort of completely broken.\n\n(laughs) Pay-as-you-go but then what do you get? I like that.\n\nWell, right, but, I mean, just to clarify for our listeners. What I\nmean by ‘completely broken’ is that at any point in time in C and C++\nyou can just say, ‘Oh, ignore the type system. And I’m gonna just take\nthis thing and change its type to be something else.’ And the\nlanguages, you know, they take this stance of, trust the programmer,\nthat when the programmer decides to do this, that this is a good\nidea. But we lose the guarantees that one would want from a type\nsystem like that when you dereference a pointer that there’s actually\nsomething there when you dereference it.\n\nSo, getting back to memory control, I like the idea of pay-as-you-go\nthere, or maybe it’s not even pay-as-you-go as much as a language that\ncan have multiple different modes of use with very easy interop. In\nthat we can have a system where there’s not fine memory management,\nthat you just sort of use the current OCaml’s system of uniform memory\nrepresentation, and then another part where maybe this particular team\nor this particular file says, ‘No, no. Here I really want careful\nmemory management.’ This is a different kind of pay-as-you-go. It’s\nsort of at the file level or something like that, or the package\nlevel, I suppose. And then as long as one piece of code can easily\ncall the other, that also works well.\n\nWe also see this kind of idea coming out in polyglot systems where we\nactually have multiple languages all calling one another because maybe\nthis part of the system is easier to write in some language, that part\nof the system is easier to write in some other language. It’s all a\nway of, these sort of different approaches to attack the same problem\nthat we don’t wanna have all of this complexity. We want to sort of\nnarrow down what complexity we have, where.\n\nRight. So there’s almost a notion of different dialects within the\nsame language?\n\nWith a really high quality FFI that really captures all of the\nimportant details so you can kind of interoperate, right? In fact, the\nwork of polyglot stories are actually really challenging to\nengineers. There’s like, a ton—\n\n… of hard work. I mean, we’ve done a bunch of work trying to get the\nPython-OCaml interop story working just right. We’ve made good\nprogress there but it’s actually quite challenging. And I feel like\nthe work is quadratic in the number of different (laughs) languages\nthat you need to hook together ‘cause it’s often unique, weird issues\nthat come with every pairing of things that you wanna make all one to\nthe other.\n\nI think that’s right. And that’s one of the appeals of having one\nlanguage that maybe is flexible enough to operate in multiple\ndifferent modes. So, in particular, in our design for unboxed types,\nwe are planning to make a box operation explicit. And the box\noperation is going to be ‘the spot’ that allocates memory. And so,\nnormally, you’ll be able to get uses of this box operation for\nfree. Programmers won’t ever notice it, they won’t write it. It just,\nall the existing code will have all the boxes inserted. But it would\nbe really easy to imagine some kind of compiler setting that turns\nthat feature off. Meaning that every time you wanna allocate memory,\nyou have to explicitly ask for it.\n\nSo this doesn’t bring you all the way to Rust, in that there’s still a\ngarbage collector operating, you still don’t have to manually\ndeallocate memory. But if I wanna write a program that absolutely,\nwhere every allocation is known, we haven’t designed this out. Maybe\nwe’re gonna go there, maybe we’re not gonna go there. Nothing is for\ncertain. But it turned out that in our design, it just naturally fell\nout that we could just add this compiler flag that just turns off\nboxing and it would be super easy to implement and we could experiment\nto see how easy it is to work with.\n\nSo, here we’re talking about a lot of very ambitious changes to\nOCaml. One uncomfortable fact about all of this is, like, we don’t own\nOCaml, we are not the (laughs) primary upstream developers. Every time\nwe wanna make a change to OCaml, there’s a bunch of people who we have\nto convince that it’s a good change. So one of the things that you’re\nthinking about in particular is, the kind of relationship of the work\nthat we’re doing here and our connection to the larger OCaml\ncommunity. Say a little bit more about how you think about this whole\nprocess.\n\nSo, I wanna start by pushing back against ‘unfortunate fact.’ I don’t\nsee that as an unfortunate fact at all. So OCaml was born as a\nresearch project out of Inria in France and still is there. That’s\nsort of its beating heart. And we are really significant benefactors\nof that work that others have done, that others continue to do. And\nso, Jane Street has chosen to work in part of this open source\nlanguage community where we’re taking others’ ideas and we’re\ncontributing our ideas back.\n\nSo in this podcast and in our work, we have these grand ideas. ‘Oh,\nwe’re gonna add this to OCaml. We’re gonna do this, we’re gonna do\nthat. Of course, what I really mean is, we’re going to experiment with\nthis idea internally. And then as that experiment unfolds, as we gain\nexperience and become more sure that it’s a right—I shouldn’t say a\nright idea. There’s many right ideas. But as we gain more confidence\nin a particular design, we can then work with the rest of the OCaml\ncommunity to try to make this part of everyone’s OCaml and not just\nJane Street’s.\n\nAnd in that way, we’re giving back to that community. At the same\ntime, we’re continuing to reap rewards from other work happening in\nthat community. So the biggest example of which is the multicore\nsupport that’s coming in OCaml 5. Still gonna be some time before Jane\nStreet’s ready to upgrade to OCaml 5. But that was a huge pile of work\ndone mostly outside, or maybe entirely outside of Jane Street’s walls,\nand we benefit by being part of this open source ecosystem. And so, I\nthink that this is a really great place to be where we’re\nparticipating, we’re getting new input of technical content, like\nmulticore OCaml, as well as design ideas. And I’m even thinking of\nsomething just a few weeks ago where I found an infelicity in the\ncompiler, made an improvement, pushed that upstream, and then we got\nfresh ideas from folks outside of Jane Street’s walls about, ‘Here’s\nactually an even better way to do it,’ and that was great. And then we\ncould incorporate that here. Without being part of this open source\necosystem, we wouldn’t have gotten that insight and we would be poorer\nfor it.\n\nSo, in the Haskell world, you spent a lot of time working on exciting\nnew type system features for Haskell and now you’re doing, in\nsubstance, similar kinds of work here. But I think that work flow is\npretty different, right? I think then, in the Haskell world, it was\nlike the primary work and ideation and evaluation was all deeply\nintegrated from the beginning in the open source world. And here,\nwe’re doing this work where we’re still open source, still, you know,\nyou can go look at the results on GitHub. But we are mostly iterating\ninternally, and then, over time, as we gain experience, as we gain\nmore confidence that the things we’ve built are good ideas, working to\nsee what subsets of these we can get upstreamed. I’m curious how that\nhas changed your feeling about the work, how it changes the texture of\nthe work that you do?\n\nSo working within the context of Jane Street gives us a lot more\nopportunity for experimentation. So a real big challenge of doing\nlanguage design is that, by necessity, you come up with an idea and\nmaybe you think it’s a good idea and you experiment with it on a few\nsmall programs on your own machine or you get your friend to sort of\nexperiment. You bounce the idea. Maybe, you know, you’re even\nproactive and you convene a committee of experts on this idea and now\nyou have, you know, five people thinking really hard about this one\nidea and trying to come up with the absolute best design.\n\nBut then, once you come up with the design, if you’re just in an open\nsource environment—without the context of a place like Jane Street—you\ndevelop the idea, implement it, and release it, and then now you have\nthousands or hundreds of thousands of programmers using it, and maybe\nit was a bad idea. But by the time you discover that it was a bad\nidea, it’s a little bit too late because maybe you have 90,000\nprogrammers who think it’s a bad idea, but you have a thousand who\nthink it’s a fantastic idea and will be very, very, very upset if you\nbreak their programs by changing it. And now you’re in a bad way.\n\nAnd even the people who think it’s a bad idea, who would like to get\nrid of it, don’t necessarily want you to break their programs in the\ninterim before they’ve (laughs) stopped relying on the feature.\n\nThat’s right. And so, it’s really, really hard to make changes to a\nproper open source programming language. In the context of Jane Street\non the other hand, it’s—I don’t wanna say dead easy. There’s work\ninvolved, but it is tractable and somewhat easy in that we can develop\nan idea, push it out there, get other programmers in the firm to start\nusing it, and then as that happens, we can say, ‘Mm. This isn’t quite\nworking out the way that we thought it would.’ That, you know, theory\nmeets reality, and theory loses.\n\nAnd so, then we can make a change to the feature and we have sort of\nan operation that we use internally called a ‘tree smash,’ where some\nJane Street engineers work together to come up with a big diff that\nhappens to all of Jane Street’s code, all at once, and we can change\nthe spelling of a keyword if we want to. And in fact, we’re imagining\nthis now. So Jane Street has been working on a feature called ‘local\ntypes’ or ‘stack allocation.’ These two things are kind of the same\nthing. And we’re realizing that one aspect of the design was just a\nbit wrong. And there’s already a ton of code written using the old\ndesign, but we’ve invented a new keyword and a new place for the\nkeyword to appear, and all this stuff.\n\nAnd so, it’s gonna be some work to fix it, but there’s no part of us\nthat’s saying, ‘Oh no. Now we need to think about a migration plan and\nwe need to make sure that no one is too unhappy with this.’ We’re just\ngonna go do it. And so, it means by the time we get to upstreaming,\neverything is battle-tested. And so, it just increases the level of\nconfidence in the design when we go through that process.\n\nOne of the concerns I could see people having about this kind of\nprocess is, it’s going to do a lot of training on, ‘What are the\nrequirements within Jane Street?’ But there are all sorts of ways in\nwhich you could imagine the requirements in Jane Street and outside of\nJane Street being different. I’m curious how you think about the\ndesign process in a way where you end up with language features that\nare likely to be of quite general utility, ‘cause I think, in the end,\nthe only ones you’re gonna get accepted upstream are the ones that\npeople think are more broadly useful than just being useful for us.\n\nSo that’s indeed a challenge, right? It’s a challenge of overfitting,\nright? We have a very particular style of code within Jane Street and\na very particular use case that we’re working on. I think that is sort\nof a harder question to answer in some sense. I think one way that we\naddress that is by seeking outside feedback from the very\nbeginning. So, the plan that we have for unboxed types, another Jane\nStreet engineer, Stephen Dolan, he made a presentation about this\ndesign for unboxed types, I think in 2019. We’ve been thinking about\nthis for a long time. The local types and stack allocation feature,\nthis has also been featured in a number of presentations that we’ve\nmade to the OCaml community, out in public.\n\nAnd so, by incorporating that process early, we can get broad\nfeedback. That’s not the kind of feedback that tells us, ‘Oh, should\nthe keyword go here, or should it go there?’ Right? That’s the kind of\nthing that we develop internally. But I think that, by giving these\npresentations, by involving the broader community, even from the very\nbeginning, that helps to prevent some of this overfitting problem.\n\nSo, another interesting aspect of your background is, you’ve spent a\nlot of time, years really, working in the Haskell community and\nworking on Haskell. And now, you’re working on a totally new\nprogramming language using it both as the surface language in which\nyou write your programs, and also helping to design that language. I’m\ncurious, what struck you about difference? I’m curious, what are the\ndifferences that have struck you about Haskell and OCaml at multiple\ndifferent levels?\n\nIt’s been really fun over the past, I guess, six months now being part\nof these two language communities. So, I should say, I’m still quite\nactive in the Haskell world. I have not left the Haskell world. I’m\nliving both Haskell and OCaml on a daily basis. So let me think of a\ncouple of interesting points of comparison.\n\nSo, one is, it seems kind of simple, but actually I think it affects\nthe way that we program. The approach toward interfaces. In Haskell,\nyou tend to write your type signatures sort of right next to the\nfunction and Haskell uses a lot of type signatures. OCaml doesn’t so\nmuch. And so, OCaml there’s these separate interface files where you\ndefine the interface to your whole module, but it’s kind of apart and\nit means, in my experience, looking at a bunch of OCaml code. OCaml\ncode tends to be rather less documented than similar Haskell code, and\nI think that’s in part because in Haskell, you put your types right\nthere and that’s a form of documentation. And once you put your types\nin, then you can also put more documentation there and it becomes part\nof the habit of the Haskell programmer to put those comments right in\nthere.\n\nA flip side of this, is that Haskell has this feature called\ntypeclasses. And typeclasses allow you to use essentially one\nfunctioning to mean a variety of different things. OCaml doesn’t have\nthat feature. And so, what that can mean sometimes is that Haskell\ncode can become quite a bit harder to understand because if you have a\nbunch of these function names, any of which can mean a variety of\ndifferent things, all strung together, then it takes a lot of work on\nthe part of the reader to try to understand what on earth is going on\nthere. And that problem just doesn’t arise in OCaml. OCaml is much\nmore explicit about what operations it’s taking.\n\nSo maybe I can even, taking these two examples, generalize that a\nlittle bit and say, I find Haskell to be somewhat more explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time. Whereas, OCaml is somewhat more\nexplicit about what’s happening at runtime. So another place where\nthat comes into play is that, the Haskell compiler—and this connects\nwith a topic we were talking about earlier—the Haskell compiler\noptimizes much more aggressively than the OCaml one does. And that’s\nbecause in Haskell, Haskell’s a lazy language which means that if you\nsay, ‘Let X equal some big computation,’ we’re not gonna compute the\nbig computation until we need the value of X. In OCaml, if you say,\n‘Let X equal a big computation,’ we just compute that thing right\naway.\n\nAnd so, that means, on the one hand you might say, ‘Oh, well maybe\nHaskell is more efficient,’ because maybe some code path never uses\nthe value of X and so it means that we can discard that whole big\nthing. But it also means that it’s much harder to predict in Haskell\nhow fast your program is going to run or what its performance\ncharacteristics are gonna be. In OCaml, it’s much easier to predict\nthat. You can just sort of read your file top to bottom and, within a\nfunction, it just performs the operations that you see roughly in the\norder that you see them. And that means, OCaml again is more explicit\nabout what happens at runtime, but without some of the type\nannotations that we see in Haskell, a little less explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time.\n\nYou mentioned a couple of things that are different that I wonder if\nthey’re really language differences, or just cultural differences. If\nyou look at the tendency to do fewer type annotations on the\ndefinition of functions, you could put more type annotations. And I\nthink there are some people who write OCaml who do, but there’s\ncertainly a tendency not to and I think the Jane Street house style\ncertainly is one that does not have lots of type annotations, outside\nof interface files where those are essentially required everywhere.\n\nAnd the documentation thing, too, like, the interface files are a very\nnatural place to put documentation and I am constantly dissatisfied\nthat I think we put way too little documentation in the (laughs)\nplaces that we could. And I don’t know that there’s anything exactly\nabout the language that forces that. Like, I’m not sure that I buy\n‘the need to put type annotations right on functions’ is the thing\nthat really makes that difference.\n\nThat may be true. It’s hard to say. I do think that form follows\nfunction, function follows form a little bit, in that, when you’re\nused to describing the specification of a thing right next to that\nthing, that, to me, is going to encourage you to write\ndocumentation. Whereas, in OCaml, you write the specification over\nthere, in that other file, nowhere near where you write your\nimplementation. And sometimes I think that means that you’re less\nlikely to put those comments on the implementation when you need them.\n\nIt’s funny. My intuition is the opposite of, like, ‘Oh, I’ve written\nthis very bare interface file that just has types,’ and I think\nempathetically about the person who’s reading it. It’s like, ‘How will\nthey have any idea what this means? I had better put a comment here.’\n(laughs)\n\nRight. So the comment and the interface files are good, but I think\nit’s not just that. I mean, and this could also be, I have a bias in\nthat, most of the OCaml that I’m reading and writing is in the OCaml\ncompiler itself. Maybe this is different than everything else at Jane\nStreet. In fact, I’m sure it is. And it has been striking for me after\nspending so many years working in Haskell’s compiler, that Haskell’s\ncompiler has many, many, many more comments than OCaml’s compiler\ndoes. Maybe I’m overfitting on this particular piece of software\ninstead of just the language in general.\n\nI do think looking at the innards of a compiler is always a weird\nplace to think about how one should write code for the\nlanguage. Because, like, one of the facts about OCaml—as it is often\nthe case for many languages—is that OCaml was written by people who\ndidn’t yet really know how to program in OCaml kind of by\ndefinition. And lots of the code that’s there now has been there for a\nlong time and you can sorta see that. I think if you went to those\nsame people today and been like, ‘How would you write this now?’\nThey’d all be like, ‘Oh, really very differently.’ But, you know,\nparts of it just kind of haven’t been rewritten and have the shape\nthat they did years ago and are harder to understand than kind of\nanyone would exactly like it to be today.\n\nAnd to be fair, that exact same thing is true in the Haskell\ncompiler. There are stretches of that that no one would write it that\nway today. But it was written that way before anyone really knew how\nto program in Haskell.\n\nSo another difference that’s always struck me about Haskell is the\ndifferent approach to language extensions. And I think about this in\ntwo different ways. One is, OCaml is just massively more\nconservative. There was a period in time early in OCaml’s development\nwhere you could almost see the process of Ph.D. students\ngraduating. It’s like someone graduates, they write some language\nfeature, and it gets added to the language. And that stopped pretty\nearly in OCaml. OCaml got pretty conservative about making changes. It\nwas like, ‘No, no, no, we’re gonna add things that are like, really\ngood, and it was pretty restrictive about what would go in. And\nthroughout that time, it kind of had one language, pretty much. OCaml\nworked in one particular way and that was kinda that.\n\nHaskell on the other hand, has had a lot of glorious experimentation\naround language features and those experimental language features were\noften hidden behind pragmas, right? There’s lots of different things\nyou could turn on and off. And so there kind of isn’t one Haskell or\ntwo Haskells, but there’s like 10,000 different Haskells, depending on\nwhich collection of flags you wanna turn on or turn off. You have 10\ndifferent pragmas and now you have two of the 10 different possible\narrangements of the language features. I’m curious how you think about\nthose different sets of choices?\n\nYeah. I mean, that’s a great question. So I do have to push back\nagainst your sense of scale. So Haskell has, when I last counted, and\nthis was a few years ago, 150 or so extensions. So Haskell has\nactually 2150 languages.\n\nOuch, indeed. So I think that this comes from the origin of Haskell\nversus the origin of OCaml so actually you probably know more about\nthe origin of OCaml than I do. But I know Haskell was started by\ncommittee. There was a committee that met starting in, I think, 1989\ninto 1990, coalescing these ideas around a lazy functional programming\nlanguage. And then this eventually became a Haskell standard and there\nwere multiple different compilers for Haskell that all implemented the\nsame standard Haskell. And then maybe one compiler would think, ‘Ooh,\nwouldn’t it be fun if we had X?’ And so, then they would add that\nfeature, but everyone still wanted to make sure that it was a Haskell\ncompiler and not this other special language based on Haskell\ncompilers. So there was an idea of language extension. So you could\nhave base Haskell plus these various extensions.\n\nSo, in other words, OCaml is like Python and Haskell is like Scheme?\n\nSure. Yes. In that OCaml has a manual for the language, but there is\nnot a standard. There are not multiple different software artifacts\nthat all compile some OCaml language that exists beyond a single\ncompiler. But, in any case, going back to Haskell, that was the early\ndays of Haskell and there were multiple Haskell compilers. As time has\ngone on, all of the other ones have either died off or there are still\na few other Haskell compilers out there, but there’s not really an\nattempt to stay current with the newest features. And there’s really\nnow just one: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, or GHC. And that’s the one\nthat, when I say that there’s 150 language extensions, the GHC is\nsupporting that.\n\nAnd so, when you have multiple different things, if you wanted to find\na common core that all of these different compilers can interop with,\nit makes a lot of sense to have individual extensions when you say\nyou’re deviating from this common core. Now there’s really just one\ncompiler.\n\nI think that the current system, the current plan at Haskell, is not\nvery well motivated. And instead, the feedback that I hear from users\nis that they find the whole language extension system very heavy and\nit means that, to get much done in Haskell, you need to now start your\nfile with the list of 20 extensions that you’re using. And newcomers\ncan’t tell the difference between brand new experimental extensions\nthat might change from one compiler to another, or extensions that\nhave been around for 20 years, or there are some extensions that have\nbeen around for 20 years but actually we know are dangerous and you\nreally shouldn’t use.\n\nAnd when I say, ‘We know,’ I mean, like, I know this and a couple of\nother Haskellers know this, but someone just picking up the language\nwon’t know that. And I personally find that quite problematic. And so,\nthere’s a debate going on right now within the GHC Steering Committee\nwho is a body chosen to sort of help evaluate the evolution of the\nlanguage to reimagine all of this. And I’m hoping that we end up with\na structure that looks quite different from what we have today, while\nstill retaining backward compatibility.\n\nSo if you have your 20 language extensions at the top of your file,\nthat will continue to work in this new vision. But I am hoping that we\ncan reorganize it in a way that’s a little bit more user-friendly.\n\nDo you think in the end it would make sense to move toward something\nwhere there’s closer to one standard language that includes most of\nthe extensions, and so that most users end up not thinking about that\n‘two to the whatever’ configuration space?\n\nI do think settling on one standard language would be good. I think we\ncan get 80% of the way there and go from 150 extensions to maybe seven\nor something like that. I don’t think we’ll be able to get all the way\nthere because there’s just too many different use cases for Haskell,\nthere’s too many different people who have slightly different ideas of\nwhat that core should be. So if we just sort of got rid of the\nextensions mechanism, I think that that would cause too much of a rift\nin the community and probably not be tenable. But we can get close.\n\nSo, throughout this conversation, I feel like there’s been a\nparticular kind of vision and idea of what programming is that’s\nmotivated a lot of your thinking. And that has something to do with\nhaving a language that’s simultaneously expressive, it lets you say\nwhat you wanna say, but also has real tools for reasoning, in both\ntype systems and, you know, more sophisticated mode-dependent types,\nor essentially automated tools for reasoning about your program. So in\nthe last, I don’t know, few months, couple of years, there’s been an\nenormous amount of motion in a totally different direction for making\nprogramming better, which is various AI-assisted ways of making\nprogramming easier. With all of this kind of recent work on large\nlanguage models, things like ChatGPT, Codex, all of that, making an\nenormous difference to how people are programming on a regular\nbasis. I’m curious how you think about this and how it fits into your\nbroader way of thinking about programming?\n\nI see this evolution of sort of AI-assisted programming as not quite\nthe sea change that maybe others have seen it to be. I see it as a big\nstep. It’s not a small step change. But it doesn’t remove the need to\ncommunicate precisely. In that, to me, the interesting thing about a\nprogramming language is that it’s a mode of communication that is\nprecise. In a sense, that’s almost the definition of what makes a\nprogramming language a programming language, as opposed to some other\nkind of language. There’s a precise semantics to everything that is\nsaid in that language. And that language is used as a medium of\ncommunication, both from human to computer. That’s how we often think\nof it. But also from human to human.\n\nWith the advent of AI-assisted programming, now we have sort of a new\nmethod of communication in that it’s a communication from computer\nback to human. In that, you might have something like ChatGPT\nproducing the code, but a human still has to read that code and make\nsure that it does what you think it does. And as a medium of precise\ncommunication, it’s still very important to have a programming\nlanguage that allows that communication to happen.\n\nAnd so, this new mode of communication is going to put different\npressures on language design than what we’ve had in the past. But I\ndon’t think it removes the need for programming language design. But\nlike I said, it does create different pressures and these have been\nevident for some time in that one little maxim I’ve had in my head for\nyears now about language design is that you wanna optimize for\nreading, not for writing. Code gets read much more often than it gets\nwritten.\n\nAnd so, when designing a new language feature, maybe you’re thinking,\n‘Okay, I could do this very cleverly with, like, a nicely placed\ntwiddle in this spot in the code. And I could use that twiddle to mean\nsomething very important about my program. And maybe that’s very\nconcise, but it’s hard to read, it’s hard to search for, it’s hard to\ntrain new people to understand. Instead, it tends to be better to\nwrite out words in your design and programming language, that’s easier\nto search for, and easier to learn, and just easier to organize in\nyour brain. If we end up getting to a mode where humans are doing even\nless and less writing, and computers are doing more and more of it,\nthen those pressures just increase. And we wanna make the language\neasier to read and maybe even harder to write. Maybe we even get to a\npoint where if computers are doing all of the code generation, it’s\njust kind of, you know, symbolic and structured. It’s not just text.\n\nSo we get these richer programming languages but I just don’t see it\nas, there was yesterday and then there’s tomorrow and it’s gonna be\ntotally different and let’s just start from scratch. I see this as\njust one phase in evolution of this precise communication medium.\n\nOne of the things that’s really striking about these AI assistants, at\nleast in their current form, is they’re really surprisingly powerful,\nright? They can really do a kind of stunningly good job of taking a\nquery and understanding it and providing a piece of code that tries to\ndo what it is that you asked for it to do.\n\nBut they’re also strikingly fallible. They make lots of mistakes. And,\nyeah, the reading thing is pretty important because you ask ChatGPT\nor, you know, whatever your favorite large language model is, to write\na piece of code and look at the result. And it’s super easy for the\nresult to just be wrong in all sorts of different ways. And I can sort\nof see the rising requirement of making things more readable. I’m\ncurious how you think things like dependent types fit into this story?\n\nSo, dependent types in their essence are a way of writing precise\nspecifications. So the sorting example that I gave earlier, I\ndescribed that, you know, you could have a function instead of going\nfrom ‘a list of ints to a list of ints’ to something more\nglorious. Well, before dependent types, or you know, language without\ndependent types, you could just do that in comments. But probably in\nyour comments, you’re not going to be as precise as you could be if\nyou really wrote it in types, right? You say, you know, return to the\ninput list in ascending order, or something like that. But what does\nthat really mean?\n\nWe need a language where we can precisely specify what this function\nis doing. So as I said earlier, ascending isn’t quite right. I mean,\nif you write in a comment, ‘This returns the input list in ascending\norder,’ well, what if the input list has duplicates? Now you can’t\neven meet that specification. Where actually, that specification\ndoesn’t make any sense at all because the input list isn’t in\nascending order. What does that mean to say to put the input list in\nascending order? That’s a contradiction in terms, because the input\nlist isn’t in ascending order.\n\nAnd so, there’s some amount of interpretation that humans can provide,\ninterpretation that a large language model can provide, but in the\nend, it’s gonna come down to precise communication and\nspecification. And so, where do dependent types fit in? Well, they can\nbecome the input to the large language model. Maybe now we have\nprogrammers who are well-versed in precise communication of\nspecifications, not implementations, and we can say, ‘ChatGPT, give me\na function of this type.’ And then you have your nice type that takes\nan input list, and it returns an output list that is a permutation of\nthe input list in non-decreasing order and we specify that.\n\nAnd then now, that gives a nice specification for ChatGPT to go off\nand say, ‘Okay, here’s an implementation that meets that. Oh, and by\nthe way, it has this asymptotic running time because I’m a nice large\nlanguage model and I’m gonna tell you that.’ And then, now we actually\nhave a model by which we can check that the result meets its\nspecification if it is in this precise language of dependent types.\n\nAlthough I have to say, I think I am more pessimistic about the idea\nof people actually going off and writing down the specifications\neven. ‘Cause those are actually pretty hard to write.\n\nI wonder if a more plausible model is, you go to your large language\nmodel and say, ‘Please write me a specification for a function that\nsorts a list.’ And then it, like, spits something out. And then you\nlook at it and think, yeah, that seems about right. And then you go\nfrom there to next stages. But the role that this kind of concise\nspecification has, it’s like a smaller and maybe more readable thing\nthat you can use as part of verifying whether the later pieces in fact\ndo what you think they’re supposed to do.\n\nYes, but I think there’s a real danger here. I agree with what you say\nin that, writing a precise specification is hard. And humans are\nlazy. So if it’s hard, we’re gonna ask the computer to do it. If we’re\nasking the computer to write the specification of the function that\nit’s going to write, now we’re getting into thin ice. Because if we’re\nworking in a system where the human is not expert enough to be able to\nread the specification and know that it’s the right specification, now\nwe’ve lost. Now the computer can just sort of go off and do whatever\nit wants and we have no way of knowing whether it’s right or wrong\nbecause we’ve lost that ability to sort of have that precise\ncommunication.\n\nI think one of the tricky things here is, people are often pretty bad\nat the reading part of this, right? The idea if something gets written\nand now you have to read it, especially if it wasn’t written in a\nreally clear way, reading some piece of code that is not really\nwell-structured is actually really challenging. Like, one of the\nactually most important parts of the process of code review I find, is\nnot so much that, like, one person writes the code and someone else\nreads it to validate that it’s done the right thing. It’s more like,\nsomebody writes the code and the other person says, ‘Oh, man. This is,\nlike, too messy for me to even read.’ And then there’s some kind of\nback and forth process where you try and get something that’s actually\nsimple enough to be understood. And I think it’s an interesting open\nquestion of, like, as we start using more of these AI assistants, how\ngood they will be at generating things that are actually simple.\n\nAlthough, if we have precise specifications, the simplicity of the\nimplementation becomes less important.\n\nThat’s fair. I mean, in some sense there’s a kind of open\ntechnological question of, like, how good will large language models\nbe, acting as tactics for theorem provers?\n\nRight. Yeah. I mean, but if we’re in an environment where there is a\ntight correspondence between the specification and the implementation,\nand what I mean by ‘tight correspondence’ is this dependent type’s\nmodel where you can—and there’s other models, it’s not just dependent\ntypes, there’s refinement types, there’s other ways of checking an\nimplementation against a specification. But if we’re in an environment\nwhere we can check an implementation against a specification, the\nspecification is simple enough and communicated precisely whether\nthat’s in very careful natural language or probably not just natural\nlanguage ‘cause natural language is very, very squishy. But probably\nin some specification language, you could call that specification\nlanguage ‘dependent types’ if you want or you could call it something\nelse. But if we can communicate that specification, check the\nimplementation against the specification, now suddenly there’s not all\nthat much incentive to ever read the implementation.\n\nRight. It becomes a little bit like, you know, reading the output of\nthe compiler.\n\nYeah. It’s interesting. I do wonder whether a whole potential kind of\ndirection for innovation here, which you more or less have pointed in\nthe direction of, is designing languages that work usefully in this\nkind of intermediate things to generate in the process of working with\nsome kind of AI assistant. The thing that’s generated as an\nintermedium really affects the overall process of working on the\nsystem and generating confidence it’s doing the right thing. It’s not\na totally new problem, I guess, in the context of language design. But\nit does put new kinds of pressure and maybe changes the trade-offs\nthat show up.\n\nYeah, that’s right. I mean, you know, it’s too early, I think, to\nstart to design a programming language around this kind of\ninteraction. We’ve only been having these interactions with these\nassistants for a few months. And they’re changing fast. So I think now\nwould be the wrong time. In two years, maybe one could start thinking\nabout designing a language from scratch to do this. That sounds\nplausible to me. But I think a good starting point would be languages\nthat we have now because they’re designed for precise\ncommunication. That’s, in the end, what we need. And, again, maybe\nthere’s less pressure on the writing piece and more pressure on the\nreading piece. But I don’t think that they’re so divorced from each\nother that it means that we throw out everything we have and start\nfrom scratch. That seems, to me, pretty unlikely.\n\nThat makes sense. Well, thanks so much for joining me. This has been a\nlot of fun.\n\nYou’ll find a complete transcript of the episode, along with links to\nsome of the things that we discussed at signalsandthreads.com.

    "fullText": "America’s distilleries have faced a perfect storm of economic and market headwinds that has pushed many out of business in recent years.\n\nFirst, many Americans are drinking less, especially younger ones.\n\n\"Young adults in the U.S. have become progressively less likely to use alcohol over the past two decades, with the percentages of 18- to 34-year-olds saying they ever drink, that they drank in the past week and that they sometimes drink more than they shouldall lower today. At the same time, drinking on all three metrics has trended up among older Americans while holding fairly steady among middle-aged adults,\" according to a Gallup poll.\n\n62% of adults under age 35 say they drink, down from 72% two decades ago.\n\nConversely, drinking has increased among adults aged 55 and older.\n\nYoung adults are also drinking less frequently and are less likely to drink to excess.\n\nIn addition, distilleries continue to feel the effects of tariffs imposed during President Donald Trump’s administration, which have increased production costs and contributed to a sharp drop in U.S. whiskey exports to key markets like the EU.\n\n“We’re very worried about what tariffs could do to our industry,” said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers Association, reported WKYT.\n\nTake those two challenges together, and it's not surprising that American distilleries, including Artisan Distillery & Craft Bar, have decided to close their doors.\n\nThose impacts are already being felt.\n\nAmerican Whiskey exports to the EU, the U.S. spirits industry’s largest export market, have tumbled by 33% and cost $300 million since the EU’s 25% retaliatory tariff went into effect on June 22, 2018, according to a new report released by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States on the two-year anniversary.\n\nThe EU levied the destructive tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.\n\n“American distillers enjoyed two decades of unparalleled growth in the EU prior to the implementation of these retaliatory tariffs,” said Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). “This report makes clear that these tariffs took the wind out of the sails for American Whiskey exports to our top export market, which has resulted in a loss of more than a quarter of a billion dollars of sales.”\n\nArtisan Distillery & Craft Bar became famous for its Spike Vodka, a spirit made with nopal instead of the traditional fermented cereal grains or potatoes. Later, the distillery added gin, whisky, moonshine, and a tequila-like agave liquor and branched out to brewing beer.",

    "title": "My friend, who had no children or wife, died suddenly. His sister is contesting his will. Will she succeed?",
    "description": "“He did not intend to leave anything to his sister, his only living relative.”",
    "fullText": "A friend died suddenly six months ago. He had told my husband and me that he did not intend to leave anything to his sister, his only living relative. He has no spouse or children. Someone closer to the situation told us she is contesting the will. In the probate filing, which is in the public domain, she is listed as “interested person.” There is also a personal representative. They are represented by the same lawyer. That doesn’t seem right.\n\nMy friend, who had no children or wife, died suddenly. His sister is contesting his will. Will she succeed?\n\n‘It’s been a struggle getting payments from her’: I rent a house to our daughter. Do I just gift her the house?\n\nFor the first time in years, more homeowners have a 6% mortgage rate than a 3% one. That’s great news for frustrated buyers.\n\nThis 100-year-old stock-market indicator just flashed a buy signal. Here’s how investors should read it.\n\nTrying to Preserve My Friend’s Wishes\n\nYour friend’s sister and the “personal representative” — likely, the executor of the will who is representing your friend’s wishes as set out in his will — sharing the same lawyer would only amount to a conflict of interest for the attorney in question if the sister files a lawsuit to contest the will. If that happened, I assume the lawyer would decline to take the sister’s case.\n\nOnly someone with legal standing — an executor, heir, creditor or beneficiary, for example — can typically file a petition in a case such as this. A friend of the deceased, in most cases, has no standing to complain about attorney conflicts. Courts expect the client who is impacted, not a third party, to raise potential ethical issues.\n\nA conflict of interest would arise only if the sister formally contests the will or otherwise takes a position directly against the estate. The lawyer would be required to withdraw from representing one of the parties or, possibly, withdraw entirely. Until that happens, shared representation alone is not improper.\n\n“When an executor or administrator has a personal interest in the estate, such as being a beneficiary, it can create a conflict of interest that may make it difficult for them to act impartially,” says GP Schoemakers, a law firm based in Houston. Being an heir and a beneficiary does not alone mean an executor should be removed. However, mismanagement of the estate or failure to perform duties could be considered problematic.\n\nA will can generally be contested among these grounds: lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence from a family member, and improper execution. The latter is often the easiest and most common way a will is contested and/or overturned. A person will often state they intend to disinherit a child or a sibling, in this case or, alternatively, leave them a small amount, or they might say any person who attempts to contest the will should be automatically barred from inheriting.\n\nThere are statutes of limitations to contest a will. The sister will have to act swiftly and hire a trust-and-estates lawyer. In California, for example, those deadlines are particularly short and, experts say, rigorously enforced. A will contest must be filed by the later of 120 days after the will is admitted to probate or 60 days after the contestant is served with notice of the court order admitting the will. If the will has not yet been admitted to probate, your friend’s sister may raise objections, but once the probate order is entered, the statutory time limits take effect.\n\nAll that said, here’s the harsh truth: It’s extremely difficult to contest a will, and the burden of proof lies with your friend’s sister. Sometimes, these third parties hope to slow down the process and hope that the estate or rightful/legal heir will settle in order to move on. I’ve received many letters where the case seems stronger than the one you describe; one reader wrote to say her millionaire cousin’s nursing home coerced her into changing her will and selling her house. That looked to be a clear breach of ethics and fiduciary duty.\n\nLack of testamentary capacity is one relatively common reason that could make a will vulnerable to being challenged, and could also leave one open to undue influence, duress or fraud, at least in the eyes of the court. “Unlike other grounds for challenging a will, capacity disputes often involve deeply personal family dynamics, medical testimony and complex legal standards that can determine the outcome of an estate plan,” says the Casiano Law Firm, which has offices in San Diego.\n\nMany states also provide a surviving spouse with a minimum “elective” share — that is, the right to take a share of a deceased spouse’s property. This serves to avoid the complete disinheritance of a surviving spouse. Some people might try to circumvent a spouse’s elective-share rights by transferring property to an irrevocable trust, but they generally must survive a look-back period for such a maneuver to work. Obviously, that does not apply to your friend, as he died without a spouse.\n\nBut your friend’s sister has her work cut out for her — and her own lawyer’s fee to pay.\n\nPrevious columns by Quentin Fottrell:\n\n‘I’m in a financial mess’: My income was cut in half.

Newlin ordered Hartmann not to have contact with minors and prohibited his use of the internet.\n\n\"The investigation began in November 2025 when agents with FDLE’s Tallahassee Regional Operations Center conducted an undercover operation aimed at targeting online predators. During the operation, Hartmann contacted an undercover FDLE agent who Hartmann believed to be a 15-year-old female. Hartmann’s charges are based on his communications with the agent acting in an undercover capacity,\" FDLE wrote in a statement released Jan. 8.\n\nThe investigation into Hartmann is still active.\n\n\"Now, he’ll be in court — not on the court,\" FDLE wrote in a post on social media that included a photo of him handcuffed outside a patrol vehicle and the school.\n\nIn an email to parents Thursday morning, Chiles Principal Joseph Burgess assured them that \"no Chiles or LCS students were involved in this matter.\"\n\nLeon County Schools spokesperson Chris Petley said Hartmann was not on the payroll or considered an employee of the district and instead was a \"volunteer coach.\"\n\n\"This morning the administration met with the student-athletes and notified their parents of the circumstances including the promotion of Coach Michael Quiggins as the Interim Chiles Head Girls Basketball Coach. Our young ladies will continue to compete and represent Chiles High School,\" Burgess wrote in the email.\n\nHartmann moved to Florida in 2014 and was the co-head coach with the Tallahassee City League. He began coaching at Chiles in 2021 and at the time told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter he was \"excited about getting the head coaching job. With my background and the staff I have, we can elevate the program.\"\n\nAccording to court records that were initially posted to the Leon County Clerk website before being removed for redaction, Hartmann used the social media platform, Kik, to reach out to a user in a \"Tally\" group chat.\n\n\"Hartmann is the owner of the Kik account 'big dirk,' which has been used repeatedly to engage in sexual conversations with minors,\" police reports say, noting he also used the alias \"Eric.\"\n\nThe user he reached out to was an undercover officer with \"2010\" in their username. Hartmann allegedly told the user he was 36 years old and assumed she was 15, the court records say.\n\nThe undercover officer told Hartmann they are currently enrolled in a local high school. After that Hartmann allegedly asked the user if she ever had sex before and expressed that he wanted to engage in sexual conduct, according to the records.\n\nIn another incident with a user said to be 15-years-old, Hartmann allegedly acknowledged the teen's age and proceeded to send her a picture of his genitals and engaged in sexual conversation with her, the court records state.\n\nAlaijah Brown covers children & families for the Tallahassee Democrat.

    "fullText": "A 550-pound black bear that had been living under an Altadena man’s home for more than a month has finally been removed, thanks to help from a wildlife rescue group.\n\n“I’m relieved – no more banging under the house and smelling him and wondering what’s going on under there,” Ken Johnson, the homeowner, told KTLA’s Jillian Smukler on Thursday.\n\nJohnson said the bear took up residence in the crawlspace beneath his home just before Thanksgiving, and repeated efforts to coax it out didn’t work.\n\nState wildlife officials tried to remove the bear using paintball guns, air horns and other tactics – but were unsuccessful. Johnson said the effort stalled after officials received instructions from Sacramento to pull back.\n\nAfter that, he threatened to sue the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for negligence and emotional distress.\n\nThe breakthrough, however, came when the BEAR League, a nonprofit based in Lake Tahoe, offered to help at no cost. The team, Johnson said, used similar methods to those employed by state agencies – paintball guns – but completed the job in about 10 minutes on Tuesday.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it was so fast,” Johnson said. “These guys went in, they crawled in behind him and, boom, he was out.”\n\nWhen the bear returned two nights later to climb back into the crawlspace, it encountered an electrified mat over the opening that gave it a small shock — so it took off. Only time will tell if it’s gone for good.\n\nJohnson described the removal as a “late Christmas gift.” He can now assess the damage the bear caused underneath his home, which includes a ruptured gas line.",

    "description": "\"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration believes you don't have the right to record Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in public. This stance is both factually wrong and an attempt to chill free speech by conflating it with violence.\n\nAt a July 2025 press conference in Tampa, Florida, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said, \"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations, encouraging other people to come and to throw things, rocks, bottles.\"\n\nIn September 2025, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin called \"videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online\" a form of doxing. She added, \"We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nThese aren't idle threats. The Trump administration strong-armed Apple into removing an app from its mobile store that tracked ICE activity and threatened criminal investigations into its creators.\n\nThe most aggressive application of this policy has come in Chicago under \"Operation Midway Blitz,\" where ICE officers have relentlessly targeted protesters, reporters, and clergy engaged in protected First Amendment activity.\n\nIn October, a group of journalists and protesters filed a lawsuit alleging \"a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians.\"\n\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs stated that federal officials' own testimony illustrated their point. For example, when ICE field director Russell Hott was asked if he agreed \"that it's unconstitutional to arrest people for being opposed to Midway Blitz,\" he answered \"No.\"\n\n\"Similarly, [U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Greg] Bovino testified that he has instructed his officers to arrest protesters who make hyperbolic comments in the heat of political demonstrations, even though such statements—which do not constitute true threats—are protected speech,\" the motion argued. (Hott and Bovino's depositions were filed under seal, and those comments were later redacted in a corrected filing by the lawsuit plaintiffs, but not before others took screenshots of them.)\n\nBased on voluminous evidence that feds in Chicago ignored her previous orders to curb their use of force, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction against DHS in early November 2025, saying the government's conduct \"shocked the conscience.\"\n\nEllis found much of the officials' testimony not credible. Bovino, for instance, testified that he never used force against a protester he was filmed tackling, and in another instance, Ellis said, he lied about being hit with a rock before firing tear gas at demonstrators. Nor did evidence support the government's claims that federal officers issued warnings before firing less-than-lethal projectiles at those protesters.\n\n\"Describing rapid response networks and neighborhood moms as professional agitators shows just how out of touch these agents are, and how extreme their views are,\" said Ellis.\n\nThe Trump administration responded by calling Ellis an \"activist judge,\" but it is squarely wrong when it comes to recording and protesting the police. Cato Institute senior fellow Walter Olson points out that, \"While the Supreme Court itself hasn't yet faced the issue squarely, the seven federal circuits that have done so…all agree that the First Amendment protects the right to record police performing their duties in public.\"\n\nLikewise, federal circuits have upheld the right to use vulgar language to oppose police without fear of retaliation, and to warn others of nearby police checkpoints or speed traps.\n\nAs Olson writes, the administration's \"attempt to alter reality by establishing new legal facts on the ground\" ultimately serves as a green light for informal repression. \"If the agents come to believe that they have blanket immunity [for] whatever they do, or that citizens have no right to record them, they are more likely to take aggressive informal action, such as grabbing phones or taking news reporters into custody on charges of obstruction (perhaps later quietly dropped).\"\n\nIt's not hard to find examples of this rotten agency culture in practice. In late October 2025, ICE officers broke out the window of a U.S. citizen's car and detained her for seven hours after she followed and photographed their unmarked vehicles. DHS accused her of reckless driving, attempting to block in officers with her car, and resisting arrest—all claims that she and her lawyer deny. Prosecutors did not charge the woman with a crime.\n\nRecording government agents is one of the few tools citizens have to hold state power accountable. Any attempt to redefine observation as \"violence\" is not only unconstitutional—it's authoritarian gaslighting. When a government fears cameras more than crimes, it isn't protecting the rule of law. It's protecting itself.\n\nThe post The Trump Administration Says It's Illegal To Record Videos of ICE. Here's What the Law Says. appeared first on Reason.com.",

He has long argued that affordability issues are shaped by multiple forces, including insurance costs, supply constraints and local regulation.\n\nNew report reveals US may have sold Bitcoin despite Trump exec order\n\nU.S. housing crisis sparks boom in crypto-backed mortgages\n\nVenezuela could hold as much Bitcoin as Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy\n\nWhen pressed on what unintended consequences might look like, Cuban said they are hard to predict in advance.\n\n“Meaning you can’t anticipate everything,” he said, adding “I don’t know what they could be.”\n\nHis answer highlights both the appeal and the risk of blunt policy tools.\n\nWhile restricting large buyers could ease competition in some markets, it does not address the deeper shortage of homes that economists say is the main driver of high prices.",

    "description": "The president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more in a revealing new interview",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said that his only guardrail as he looks to obtain more global power is \"my own morality\"\n\nIn a new interview with The New York Times, he said he doesn't \"need international law\" to dictate his approach to foreign policy\n\nAlso in the interview, the president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making it clear that he won't be constrained by the law as he continues teasing a takeover of the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I don’t need international law,” Trump said in a new interview with The New York Times. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”\n\nWhen pressed further, the president said he understood that his administration would need to abide by international laws. However, he added, \"It depends what your definition of international law is.\"\n\nThere is, Trump insisted, just \"one thing\" that can curtail his desire for global supremacy: \"My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.\"\n\nThe interview comes less than a week after U.S. forces, under Trump's direction, captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, first lady Cilia Flores, amid \"large-scale strikes\" on the capital city of Caracas, and brought them to the U.S. to stand trial on multiple charges related to narco terrorism.\n\nThough Venezuela has installed an interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump has stated many times that the United States is now in charge of running the independent nation.\n\n\"It's going to be run very judiciously, very fairly. And it's gonna make a lot of money,\" he previously said. \"You know they stole our oil. We built that whole industry and they just took it over like we were nothing. So we did something about it. We're late, but we did something about it.\"\n\nHe later added, \"We'll be selling large amounts of oil [from Venezuela] to other countries... We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"\n\n\"We're gonna make sure the people of Venezuela are taken care of... You're going to have peace, justice...you're going to have a real country.\"\n\nHe doesn't plan to stop there. The president is also fixated on his desire to annex Greenland, which is currently controlled by Denmark, a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nTrump admitted that \"it may be a choice\" to preserve the country's relationship with NATO versus taking over Greenland, an important trade crossroads between the U.S., Europe, China and Russia.\n\n“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” he said to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”\n\nTo The New York Times, he insisted that it wasn't enough to have the country controlled by an ally — he wants exclusive, outright ownership.\n\n“Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also has his sights set on Colombia, Cuba, Iran and Mexico.\n\n\"You have to do something with Mexico. Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something,\" he previously told reporters, referring to drug cartels in the country.\n\n\"We'd love Mexico to do it. They're capable of doing it, but unfortunately, the cartels are very strong in Mexico,\" Trump added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nReferring to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Trump said his country is being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long.\"\n\nPetro spoke with the Times prior to calling Trump to discuss the threats, expressing his concern about the U.S. making a strike in Colombia, similar to the one in Venezuela.\n\n“We are in danger,” the Colombian president said. “Because the threat is real. It was made by Trump.”",

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, January 8, 2026: A nudge higher for the week",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates, which are testing 6% lows. Shop multiple lenders and lock in your best mortgage rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates remain in the low 6% range. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate for the week is 6.16%, up one basis point. The 15-year fixed rate weekly average was 5.46%, up two basis points. For weeks, home loan interest rates have been making only fractional moves, but remember, mortgage rates vary by location, even by state.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate with not just banks, but also credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is a fantastic mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on what your financial goals are when refinancing, and when your break-even point would be after paying refinance closing costs.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nRefinancing your home loan can help you pay off other debt, especially if you qualify for a cash-out refinance.

    "title": "USMC XQ-58 Valkyrie Development Makes Leap Forward With New Contract (Updated)",
    "description": "Northrop Grumman has now joined the effort to craft a fully missionized version of Kratos' XQ-58 for the Marine Corps.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps’ pursuit of a fully missionized version of Kratos’ stealthy XQ-58A Valkyrie drone has taken another step forward with a new announcement that Northrop Grumman is now aiding in the effort. Northrop Grumman says it will deliver a “mission kit” that includes its Prism autonomy package, sensors, and other capabilities to help fully turn the Valkyrie into what looks set to be the Marines’ first operational Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA).\n\nNorthrop Grumman announced today it has received a competitively awarded deal in relation to what is formally known as the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Uncrewed Expeditionary Tactical Aircraft (MUX TACAIR) Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. U.S. officials confirmed last year that the Marine Corps was moving to transition its experimental work with the XQ-58 into a full program of record to develop and field an operational CCA-type drone. The Marines have acquired at least three Valkyries since 2023. The U.S. Air Force is the only other known current operator of the XQ-58 and has been using the type for test and evaluation work since its first flight in 2019.\n\nUnder the newly announced deal, “Northrop Grumman will develop and rapidly deliver platforms that include” the aforementioned mission kit, “inclusive of sensors and software-defined technologies designed specifically for uncrewed aircraft,” according to a company press release. “The mission kit’s flexible technology can perform various kinetic and non-kinetic effects, making the platform a combat-ready asset.”\n\n“Northrop Grumman’s open architecture autonomy software package – known as Prism – will manage the aircraft’s operations autonomously,” the release adds. The company has already been conducting flight testing involving Prism using the Model 437 Vanguard jet, now also referred to as Beacon, which was developed and built by its subsidiary Scaled Composites.\n\n“Northrop Grumman remains at the forefront of advanced sensing capabilities, delivering innovative solutions that meet the needs of the warfighter with unmatched speed and reliability,” Krys Moen, Vice President for Advanced Mission Capabilities, said in an accompanying statement. “This enhanced capability set ensures optimal performance for both crewed and uncrewed platforms.”\n\n“The integration of the Kratos Valkyrie aircraft system configured with the world’s best multifunction mission systems from Northrop Grumman results in a high-capability CCA at a price point that enables the uncrewed systems to be deployed in mass with crewed aircraft,” Steve Fendley, President of Kratos’ Unmanned Systems Division, also said in a statement included in the release.\n\nNorthrop Grumman’s press release also highlights Kratos’ work on a derivative of the XQ-58 with built-in landing gear. As originally designed, Valkyrie is fully runway independent and takes off via a rocket-assisted method from a static launcher. The drone is then recovered via parachute at the end of the sortie. Kratos has also developed a special trolley that allows versions without fixed landing gear to take off from traditional runways.\n\nNorthrop Grumman has separately told Breaking Defense that its MUX TACAIR CCA deal is valued at approximately $231.5 million and covers work over a period of 24 months, and that is a so-called Other Transactional Agreement (OTA). The U.S. military uses the OTA mechanism to support rapid prototyping and other research and development work without having to go through more traditional and often more drawn-out contracting processes.\n\nOfficial U.S. military budget documents released last year said that the Marines were looking to acquire at least one MUX TACAIR CCA prototype in a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) configuration. Kratos has referred to the fixed landing gear Valkyrie derivative as the CTOL version. However, whether that is the only configuration the Marines are eyeing now is unclear, and TWZ has reached out to Northrop Grumman, Kratos, and the Marine Corps \n\n“So we’re obviously, we’ve been doing a lot of development work for the Marines, a lot of integration of mission systems, a lot of ground and flight test of those mission systems,” Kratos’ Fendley had told TWZ on the show floor of the annual Modern Day Marine conference in Washington, D.C., last year. “And that’s continued to where we’re pretty close to having a couple final versions of the aircraft.”\n\nTWZ has previously highlighted the value a runway-independent version would bring to the Marine Corps, given the service’s current focus on future expeditionary and distributed operations. Flexibility to operate from traditional runways, which could offer benefits in terms of total payload capacity and maximum range, could still be desirable, as well.\n\nOverall, “the uncrewed weapons systems under development [as part of the MUX TACAIR program] will enhance Marine Corps Aviation’s lethality and ability to support the Stand-in Force (SiF) by delivering air-to-ground, reconnaissance, and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities,” per the aforementioned budget documents. “The Marine Corps will use a spiral approach for capability insertion into TACAIR. MUX TACAIR Increment I will rapidly accelerate the time between development and fielding, ensuring rapid and relevant capability delivery of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to the warfighter.”\n\nThere has also been explicit talk about pairing the XQ-58 with the Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, and flight tests to explore this kind of crewed-uncrewed teaming have been carried out in the past.\n\nOutside of work for the Marine Corps, beyond the aforementioned developments related to launching and recovering the Valkyrie, Kratos has been steadily working to expand the performance and other capabilities of the design. The company is separately working on a miniature cruise missile called Ragnarok, which the XQ-58 can carry in its internal bay and externally under its wings, and that you can read more about here. Renderings have also shown Valkyries with AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) under their wings. Northrop Grumman has put forward the uncrewed aircraft as a notional launch platform for its Lumberjack loitering one-way attack drone, as well.\n\nThe XQ-58 has a high degree of modularity baked in from the start. Kratos has long put heavy emphasis on open-architecture systems to make it easier to integrate new and improved capabilities and functionality down the line, as well.\n\nRegardless of the aircraft’s physical configuration, there are many other questions the Marine Corps will still need to answer before it can truly field an operational CCA force, something the service itself has been open about and that TWZ regularly highlights. Much remains to be settled about how CCA-type drones will be deployed, launched, recovered, supported, and otherwise operated on a day-to-day basis, let alone employed tactically in a real-world combat environment.\n\n“We still have a lot to learn simply to get this thing airborne, flying, and executing next to an F-35, and not hitting each other,” Col. Derek Brannon, director of the Marine Corps’ Cunningham Group, said at the Modern Day Marine exhibition last year. “I know there’s a lot of work out there, but that’s important to make sure that we become lethal.”\n\nThe Cunningham Group, which falls under the office of the Deputy Commandant for Aviation, is charged with plotting out the overall future course for Marine Corps aviation developments.\n\nThis all applies equally to the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy CCA programs. All three services are pursuing their efforts in very close cooperation, including in the development of common command and control architectures. By the Navy’s own admission, the Air Force and Marine Corps CCA programs are much more mature than its effort.\n\nJoining the Marine Corps MUX TACAIR program is an important development for Northrop Grumman as a company, which has been making other inroads in the growing CCA market space recently. In December, the Air Force announced that it had assigned a formal designation, YFQ-48A, to the Project Talon drone design developed by Northrop Grumman and its subsidiary Scaled Composites. The service also said at that time that the YFQ-48A, which had only been unveiled publicly earlier in the month, was a “strong contender” for inclusion in its CCA efforts. Project Talon leveraged lessons from Northrop Grumman’s losing entry in the competition for the first phase, or Increment 1, of the Air Force’s CCA program, as you can learn more about here. Last September, the Navy also confirmed that Northrop Grumman was among the companies it had awarded contracts to for the development of concepts for future carrier-based CCAs.\n\nProject Talon is here. This next-gen autonomous aircraft is made to adapt fast.\n\nBuilt for the challenges ahead pic.twitter.com/6UOhLSBHKn\n\n— Northrop Grumman (@northropgrumman) December 4, 2025\n\nThe Marine Corps moving to field an operational version of the Valkyrie has been significant for Kratos, as well. The company has been very actively pitching versions of the XQ-58 to other customers, including ones overseas. It is working now with Airbus to craft a version for the German armed forces. Kratos has also been seeing growing export success with other designs in its tactical drone portfolio.\n\nWhen it comes to the Marine Corps CCA plans, the service has said it hopes to take delivery of the first prototype before the end of this year, and Northrop Grumman has now joined Kratos in working to make that a reality.\n\nNorthrop Grumman has now provided additional details about how it is working together with Kratos in relation to the MUX TACAIR CCA effort, and about what the company will be contributing.\n\n“Northrop Grumman and Kratos teamed up to respond together to the Naval Aviation Systems Consortium Statement of Need Request for White Papers for USMC TACAIR Increment 1 (N00019-24-9-0021).  Northrop Grumman and Kratos have collaborated successfully together on multiple projects in prime and support roles including Valkyrie,” a company spokesperson explained to TWZ. “Due to the collaborative integration needed for this solution, the team jointly decided Northrop Grumman as Lead Systems Integrator and Kratos as airframe subcontractor provided the best approach for MUX TACAIR.”\n\n“The mission kit is a fully integrated sensor suite covering multiple functions and frequency bands,” they added. “Northrop Grumman is integrating both Northrop sensors and a variety of best of breed industry sensors into a low-cost integrated solution.”\n\n“Kratos is teamed with NGC for mission configured Valkyrie derivatives and is also a subcontractor on the MUX TACAIR contract providing Valkyrie aircraft, supporting development and testing including flight testing, and supporting integration of NGC mission systems for the ultimate Marines CCA product, which Kratos will manufacture in Oklahoma City,” a spokesperson for that company also separately told TWZ.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "fullText": "GUATIRE, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela released citizens and foreigners from its prisons on Thursday in what a top government official described as a gesture to “seek peace” less than a week after former President Nicolás Maduro was captured by U.S. forces to face federal drug-trafficking charges in New York.\n\nJorge Rodríguez, brother of acting President Delcy Rodríguez and head of the National Assembly, said a “significant number” of people would be freed, but he was not specific about how many or provide names.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have freed political prisoners before, but the releases on Thursday were the first since Maduro was deposed. Human rights groups were encouraged by the releases, though it wasn’t clear yet whether this might represent the early stages of a government in transition or was more of a symbolic effort to please the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro’s loyalists to stay in control even as it exerts political pressure through crippling sanctions.\n\nJournalists, lawyers and human rights activists were among those freed on Thursday, and families waited outside a notorious prison in hopes their loved ones would be among the detainees released.\n\n“Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,” Rodríguez said in an announcement publicized over TV.\n\nNGO: 863 detained for ‘political reasons’\n\nAlfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Caracas, praised Thursday’s release as “good news” that lifted Venezuelans’ hopes that all political detainees in the country may walk free.\n\nBut he stressed that he wanted this to become “the beginning of the dismantling of the repressive system” of Maduro’s government and not remain “a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others.”\n\nDespite a widespread crackdown during the tumultuous 2024 election – in which the government said it detained 2,000 people – Venezuela's government denies that there are “political prisoners” and accuses those detained of plotting to destabilize Maduro’s government.\n\nRomero's organization said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela “for political reasons.”\n\nThe Spanish government announced Thursday that five Spanish citizens were among those released in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.\n\nForeign Minister José Manuel Albares confirmed the group includes prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel. Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, he also confirmed that Spanish citizens Andrés Martínez, José María Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno were freed.\n\nBasoa and Martínez were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024, accused by officials of being involved in a plot to destabilize Maduro’s government as Spanish intelligence agents, allegations that Spanish authorities denied at the time. Spain’s El País newspaper reported Thursday that Gorbe had been living in Venezuela and was arrested in 2024, accused of being in the country illegally with an expired visa.\n\nA number of families of those detained rushed to wait outside of a number of Venezuelan prisons on Thursday, hoping to reunite with their loved ones.\n\nPedro Durán, 60, was among those hoping to wrap his arm around his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside a prison in the town of Guatire, around 25 miles (43 kilometers) outside of Caracas. Durán said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro’s government — an accusation the family fiercely denies.\n\nDurán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors that the government may be releasing a number of detainees on Wednesday and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.\n\n“I don’t have words to express the emotion I’m feeling,” Durán said. “We’re feeling a lot of hope ... We’re just waiting now.”\n\nDespite the anticipation, fear persists in parts of the South American country as residents brace for an uncertain future.\n\n“Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven’t done already,” he said.\n\nRonal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government periodically releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.\n\nIn July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for getting home more than 200 migrants deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where they were held in a prison built to hold alleged gang members.\n\n“The regime uses them (prisoners) like a bargaining chip,” he said, adding that he and other observers will be watching not just how many people the government releases, but also whether high-profile individuals are included or if they're being released under a condition of house arrest.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela’s petroleum worldwide.\n\nBoth moves reflect the administration’s determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the U.S. will “run” the country.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "description": "Larry Page is leaving California ahead of the proposed billionaire's tax, and Jensen Huang is staying. It shows different appetites for risk.",
    "fullText": "It's a classic fight-or-flight response — with a billionaire's twist.\n\nA proposed wealth tax in California prompted the state's resident billionaires to consider whether they wanted to continue their residency if the one-time 5% tax is approved.\n\nTheir reactions, said CFP professional Don Hilario, who works with financial planning clients in California, boil down to risk tolerance.\n\nThe tax, as proposed, would only apply to assets in the state during the 2026 tax year. Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved assets out of California ahead of the January 1, 2026, deadline to avoid facing the tax, Business Insider first reported. Meanwhile, Nvidia's billionaire CEO Jensen Huang said he has \"not even thought about it once.\"\n\n\"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,\" Huang told Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow. \"I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\nHilario, whose financial planning clients include individuals in Big Tech, said that the lingering uncertainty of the tax can trigger a need for certainty and autonomy.\n\n\"People who want to have a greater sense of control will do the Larry Page route,\" he said, \"versus people who have the temperament to endure will take Jensen's route.\"\n\nHilario described a hypothetical scenario in which individuals with high net worths are considering purchasing a home. In a period where the economy and interest rates are uncertain, do you want to put the lion's share of your expenses toward the home in the event that rates will be higher in the future, or do you hold out and continue accumulating your wealth in the event that economic conditions improve?\n\n\"That's the same type of emotions that exist with this tax bill because the fear of not taking any action is unsettling,\" Hilario said.\n\nThe proposal, put forth by the union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West to offset potential budget cuts to healthcare and education, is far from being implemented — it would require 870,000 signatures to make it onto the November 2026 ballot.\n\nThe SEIU said in its proposal that the concentration of billionaire wealth in California makes the state \"uniquely positioned to address both the well-documented crisis of wealth inequality in the United States and the emerging and interrelated crises the state faces\" with the budget cuts.\n\nIn addition to Huang, Brin, and Page, other billionaires are voicing their opinions on the proposed wealth tax. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, wrote in a post on X that the proposal has \"massive flaws.\"\n\n\"Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,\" he said.\n\nAlex Spiro, an attorney who has previously represented billionaires, wrote in a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax were to become law. Hilario said that the significant uncertainty surrounding the proposal, including how assets will be valued and whether the tax would change over time, likely forced billionaires to decide how risk-averse they really are.\n\n\"I still think ultimately it's unclear. And I think when it's unclear, it'll make people, in this case, investors, be more cautious and defensive,\" Hilario said. \"And then a big part of it is, how do we respond emotionally? I think whether you're taking early action or enduring, you do want to gather information and avoid making a decision that would ultimately be irreversible.\"",

    "description": "As farmland prices fall in west Fresno County, one farmer bought property for its access to groundwater.",
    "fullText": "With farmland prices sagging and new irrigation rules coming, diversified farmer Michael Vander Dussen didn’t hesitate to spend $1.4 million for 321 acres in west Fresno County, as an insurance policy of sorts.\n\nVander Dussen admits he isn’t as interested in the land as much as its access to water. He recently planted a field of pistachio trees nearby, and he wants to make sure they survive.\n\n“What I want to do is preserve the ability to continue to irrigate those young trees,” Vander Dussen said. “So I will use some of that water.”\n\nThe state is in the process of implementing new water rules called the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. The goal is to protect groundwater supplies by preventing over-pumping. As part of that, groundwater sustainability agencies have been formed in the high and medium priority basins to ensure the plan is being followed.\n\nVander Dussen said both properties are in the same GSA, groundwater sustainability agency. And he intends to fallow a portion of the new property that is located west of Raisin City and south of Kerman. The farm used to grow Ruby Seedless grapes.\n\nThe Fresno Bee has started tracking these types of agriculture land sales using an AI tool that we developed to more efficiently share this news with you. Bee journalists use their reporting and writing skills to create the stories. The tool alerted us to Vander Dussen’s purchase.\n\nVander Dussen is the owner of Standard Cattle LLC, a company that specializes in raising dairy replacement heifers. But he also grows wheat, corn and hay. He’s added pistachios to his mix of crops, as a way to spread his risk.\n\n“Diversification is a necessity these days because of the ebb and flow of commodity prices,” he said. “It’s feast or famine sometimes.”\n\nHelping farmers like Vander Dussen expand their holdings is the declining value of farmland in parts of Fresno County. Farms with poor-performing crops and only groundwater wells for irrigation have seen the biggest drop in value.\n\nVander Dussen said the farm he recently purchased was valued at about $4,500 an acre. At the peak of California’s almond planting boom, that same land might have sold for $15,000 to $20,000 an acre.\n\n“This is the new norm right now,” Vander Dussen said.",

    "description": "According to an etiquette coach, you should never gossip with coworkers, poke fun at others, or bring up sensitive subjects in the office.",
    "fullText": "From spreading gossip to showing up late to meetings, employees often make subtle missteps when interacting with coworkers.\n\nAlthough many of these mistakes aren't meant to be rude, they can still affect a person's reputation at work. With more and more companies requiring workers to return to the office, it may be time for a refresher on workplace etiquette.\n\nThat's why Business Insider sat down with etiquette coach Mariah Grumet to learn about what to avoid when interacting with colleagues. Here's what she said.\n\nIn the moment, gossiping at work may seem like an opportunity to bond with coworkers. However, Grumet said it's ultimately not an appropriate way to connect with others.\n\n\"We develop close relationships with many coworkers, but there is still that boundary that needs to be respected,\" she told BI. \"It's inappropriate to spread any rumors about other people at the office.\"\n\n\"There are certain topics that should be reserved for places outside of work,\" Grumet told BI. \"We shouldn't be bringing up anything too personal, such as religion, politics, personal health concerns, appearance — anything like that that might be crossing over that boundary.\"\n\nIt's important to remember that some issues may be sensitive for others, and therefore, inappropriate in a professional setting.\n\n\"Even if you have a close relationship with someone at work, you still need to remain professional with your communication,\" Grumet said.\n\nIt's important to respect people's time — and that starts with punctuality.\n\nAccording to Grumet, being on time — whether you're attending a meeting or holding one — is respectful and shows that you care about your work.\n\n\"Being punctual is a representation of your professional image,\" Grumet said.\n\nGrumet said it's important to avoid poking fun at others, as you never know how a joke will be received.\n\n\"You can never be too careful with being respectful,\" she told BI.\n\nEven if humor is your preferred way to communicate, it's important to be cautious of what you joke about in front of coworkers.\n\nIn addition to what you do or say at work, it's also important to be mindful of your body language when interacting with others.\n\n\"Even more so than the words that we say or the tone that we use, people are paying such close attention to body language,\" Grumet said. \"When you are communicating with coworkers, you want to make sure that your body language is supporting your message and not taking away from it or creating a disconnect.\"\n\nAccording to Grumet, some examples of ways to be conscientious of body language in the workplace include leaning forward in meetings to demonstrate when you're listening or not having your arms crossed when someone is speaking to you.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 18, 2024, and most recently updated on January 8, 2025.",

    "title": "Ukraine's top general says that drones are now taking out Russia's soldiers as fast as it gets new ones into battle",
    "description": "Ukraine's commander in chief said December was the first month that its drones \"neutralized\" roughly as many Russians as were called up.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's top general said that for the first time in the war, its drones are killing or seriously wounding Russia's soldiers as fast as it can get new troops into the field.\n\nDrones are the top battlefield threat, responsible for the most casualties in this war. Ukraine relies heavily on them, especially the cheap first-person-view drones, as solutions to its manpower and equipment shortages.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Tuesday in a Telegram post that December was the first month in which Ukraine's uncrewed systems units \"neutralized\" about as many Russian servicemen as it called up in a month.\n\nHe said video confirmed 33,000 Russian losses last month. \"The real losses of the occupiers are greater,\" the general said.\n\nSyrskyi did not provide a number for the number of Russian soldiers called up. Business Insider is unable to independently confirm Syrskyi's claims.\n\nRussia hasn't provided official casualty figures. As for the number of new Russian soldiers sent to Ukraine each month, a US assessment put the number around 30,000 last April. In May, however, the Russian president said that the number was twice that. A Ukrainian intelligence assessment in December said that Russia fulfilled its 2025 mobilization target of 403,000, an average of more than 36,000 a month.\n\nRussia's armed forces in Ukraine are a mixed bag of contract soldiers who volunteer for the fight — Russia attracts volunteers with various perks, like signing bonuses — conscripts pulled in through draft cycles, and other sources. Russia has previously recruited people out of its prisons.\n\nThough exact losses are unclear, Ukrainian and Western intel assessments point to substantial attrition. Russia has a much larger population to draw soldiers from than Ukraine, which is also said to have suffered significant losses in this war. Some estimates put Russian losses at 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWhile Russia has a larger population to pull from, it has tried to avoid repeated large-scale involuntary mobilizations.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin publicly promised not to send conscripts to the front lines, fearing fallout. It has limited what Russia can do with them, even though widespread reporting and captured conscripts say assurances have been misleading.\n\nSyrskyi called 2025 a great breakthrough for Ukraine's drone war and pledged that it would not stop, with plans to grow capabilities further in 2026.\n\nHe said that in December, the number of targets that were hit or destroyed by drones rose by 31% and that the number of Russian personnel hit rose by more than 25%.\n\nSyrskyi said in November that uncrewed systems were responsible for about 60 % of all enemy targets hit. That figure has also been higher, at times, in front-line areas.\n\nDrones directly attack troops and equipment — either by carrying explosives or dropping weapons like grenades — and they also collect intelligence that shapes how armies employ other forces. Even inexpensive drones have had an outsized impact, destroying sophisticated, multimillion-dollar systems such as tanks.\n\nRussia and Ukraine are locked in a drone development race to field greater numbers and more advanced drones, as well as counter-drone technology.\n\nSyrskyi warned that Russia also has ambitious plans for its drones. He said that Russia copied Ukraine by creating a separate part of the military for uncrewed systems and said that it has 80,000 servicemen. He said Russia plans to expand that to 165,500 this year and to almost 210,000 by 2030.\n\nThere are so many drones in the sky that Ukrainian soldiers previously told Business Insider that they were sometimes unable to tell which side any belonged to and would instead try to bring them all down just to be on the safe side.",

    "description": "Brick allows you to temporarily block chosen apps and notifications on your phone. You can only unblock the apps by tapping your phone on the gadget.",
    "fullText": "I'm unfortunately among the millions of people who have become hooked on TikTok, losing countless hours of productivity to 30-second clips of soup recipes I've yet to make, hair-growing products I've yet to buy, and gua sha tutorials I'll likely never try.\n\nTired of spending my one wild and precious life staring at a screen, I decided to make a change. And thanks to Brick, a $59 gadget designed to block phone apps, I've actually been able to follow through.\n\nAs my weekly screen time report became increasingly alarming, I attempted to fight back by setting a daily one-hour limit for Instagram and TikTok on my iPhone. When I realized the limit could be bypassed with the click of a button, the software was quickly rendered completely useless.\n\nThis same struggle is what led TJ Driver and Zach Nasgowitz to create Brick, which allows you to temporarily block chosen apps and their notifications via a physical device that comes in the form of a 3D printed, 2-inch by 2-inch square magnet. You can still access the apps you need throughout the day — like texts, photos, or Google Maps — but Brick makes it harder to give in to the temptation of a quick social media dopamine hit.\n\n\"With other solutions, the 'key' that re-enables distractions is always present,\" the Brick website explains. \"Brick allows you to leave that key behind, turning your phone into a new, distraction-free device until you return.\"\n\nSetting up Brick couldn't be simpler. After downloading the corresponding app and creating an account with my email, I activated my Brick by tapping the top of my phone on the lightweight square. A single Brick can be used with multiple iPhones — unlike your Netflix account, there's no limit — so my fiancé was able to connect his iPhone to it as well.\n\nI was then prompted to allow screen time access to Brick, which gives it the ability to block and unblock apps on the iPhone, and create my first \"Mode.\" You can create different modes to block different apps. I made one titled \"Get to work!\" and chose to block Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X.\n\nYou can activate these modes through the app or by physically tapping your phone on the square. However, you can only deactivate the block by tapping your phone against the Brick.\n\nThe very first day I used Brick, I was forced to come to terms with how hooked I'd become to social media. I caught myself unconsciously picking up my phone multiple times an hour to check Instagram or TikTok. It was a major wake-up call.\n\nSo I became diligent about tapping my phone to the little Brick every morning, leaving the square in my fiancé's office so I wouldn't be tempted. The effect was almost immediate.\n\nI was barely picking up my phone during work hours and feeling far less drained after each day, no doubt thanks in part to quieting the constant stream of notifications. Even when I wasn't using Brick on the weekends, I was checking TikTok and Instagram way less.\n\nI still have plenty of work to do when it comes to untethering myself from the grips of social media, but Brick is definitely helping.\n\nIn fact, I'm using it right now.",

    "fullText": "Back in the 1980s, rotisserie chicken may have existed, but it was not a staple in the way it has become today.\n\nCostco, for example, which has become well-known for selling an entire rotisserie chicken for $4.99, did not actually start selling the popular item until 1994.\n\n\"The famous $4.99 chicken made its official Costco debut in 1994. Aside from a brief dollar increase in 2008 during the Great Recession, Costco has remained committed to keeping the chicken’s price steady despite ongoing inflation,\" according to Eat This, Not That.\n\nThe warehouse club actually loses money selling its popular chicken. But Rose Sioson, founder of Deliciously Rushed and an avid Costco shopper, thinks Costco more than makes up for it just by getting customers through the door for that value chicken.\n\n“Costco may technically lose money on each rotisserie chicken they sell, but trust me —they’re not losing when it comes to what I buy next,” Sioson told. “That chicken usually ends up in a cart with salad kits, ready-made mashed potatoes, a bottle of wine, maybe a dessert, and some random item I had zero intention of buying. It’s classic Costco strategy.”\n\nWhen a major retailer sells your core product as a loss leader, that's never great for business, but that's only one reason why Boston Market has been pushed to the edge of being fully out of existence.\n\nWhen I was a child growing up outside of Boston in the 1980s, my aunt used to visit, and she often brought a chicken from what was then known as Boston Chicken. At the time, the company was a small local chain that was actually founded in a Boston suburb.\n\nThis was the first time I had been exposed to rotisserie chicken, and the concept quickly took off. McDonald's was even an investor for a brief period.\n\nPeak footprint: Boston Market once had over 1,200 U.S. restaurants at its national height in the 1990s.\n The drop from 1,200 to 300 took place from the late '90s to 2023.\n\n2023-2024 decline: The chain shrank precipitously from 300 locations at the start of 2023 to fewer than 30 by early 2024, according to Restaurant Business Online.\n\nEarly 2025 footprint: Estimates indicate fewer than 20 locations remain open nationally in early 2025, with many stores disappearing without notice, a stark collapse from its former scale, added Flavor365.\n\nFluid numbers: Official company listings on websites and apps significantly overstate open stores; many listed units are confirmed closed, reported Restaurant Business Online.",

    "description": "Amazon rolls out an updated dashboard for managers to track office attendance and hours, expanding strict RTO policies.",
    "fullText": "What kind of badger are you? Amazon managers are about to find out.\n\nAmazon is equipping its managers with powerful new metrics to monitor their reports with a dashboard that tracks not only whether employees show up to the office, but also how many hours they spend there, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe move marks an escalation in the surveillance of white-collar workers at the e-commerce and cloud computing giant. Last year, Amazon implemented one of the industry's most stringent RTO mandates, requiring most employees to work from an office for five days a week. Now, managers have a way to spot — and potentially confront — employees who fall short of these expectations.\n\nThe updated dashboard, which began rolling out in December, allows managers and HR to view how often employees come into an office, how long they stay, and the locations where they work. It refreshes at 5 p.m. PT daily and tracks these metrics over a rolling eight-week period.\n\nThe system flags three kinds of employees: \"Low-Time Badgers,\" defined as employees whose weekly median time in the office is less than four hours per day, averaged over a rolling eight-week period; \"Zero Badgers,\" who don't badge into any Amazon building during that span; and \"Unassigned Building Badgers,\" who badge into a building other than the one they're assigned to over half the time.\n\n\"These metrics are intended to surface employees operating significantly outside documented in-office expectations,\" the document says.\n\n\"For more than a year now, we've provided tools like this for managers to help identify who on their team may need support in working from the office each day,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. \"We recently updated the dashboard to make it more consistent for all managers, but most of the data and functionality was previously available. We continue to see the benefits of having our teams working together, and we haven't changed our expectations for employees to be in the office.\"\n\nAmazon notes in the document that managers are expected to \"apply judgment\" when determining whether to initiate formal disciplinary follow-ups.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon began tracking and sharing individual office attendance records, reversing a previous policy that only tracked anonymized, aggregated attendance data.\n\nA year later, the company began cracking down on \"coffee badging\" by informing some teams that they needed to be in the office for a minimum of two to six hours to have their attendance count. The crackdown received criticism from some employees, including one who compared the move to being treated \"like high school students,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe updated dashboard standardizes these metrics across Amazon's entire corporate workforce, excluding workers such as warehouse staff and contractors. It grants managers direct, on-demand access to data that they would have previously had to request from HR, according to an Amazon employee familiar with the company's policies.\n\nAmazon is positioning the dashboard as a means to encourage in-person collaboration.\n\n\"Working In-office is important to our culture and is also about more than just being physically present during the week,\" the document said. \"Managers are expected to promote meaningful team collaboration through direct interactions with their team rather than just remotely monitoring badge swipes each week.\"\n\nAmazon is hardly alone in using badge data to police return-to-office rules.\n\nSamsung rolled out a manager-facing tool that shows \"days and time in building\" metrics, aimed at discouraging \"lunch/coffee badging.\" Dell informed hybrid staff that it will track on-site presence via badge swipes and could factor attendance into performance and compensation.\n\nBank of America issued warning notices to employees, informing some that continued noncompliance with its RTO policy could result in further disciplinary action. At JPMorgan, employees have described an internal dashboard that calculates the share of eligible days spent in the office and is visible to senior managers.\n\nIn the UK, PwC has said it would track employees' work locations to enforce its RTO policy.\n\nHave a tip?

In the weeks leading up to the riot, Trump repeatedly and falsely suggested that Pence had the power to refuse to certify the 2020 election results.\n\nHe then blamed Pence for the certification of Joe Biden’s win, leading to supporters directing their ire at the outgoing vice president during the Capitol riot with chants to “hang Mike Pence!”\n\nTrump later became the first U.S. president in history to be impeached for a second time after being accused of inciting the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nTrump was first impeached in 2019 after allegedly threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, ahead of the 2020 election. Trump was acquitted by the Senate both times.\n\nDemocrats are widely predicted to post significant victories in November’s midterms. Historically, the party in power suffers heavy losses—particularly in the House—and Trump’s turbulent second term, marked by a struggling economy, is expected to fuel voter backlash.\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans on Tuesday, Trump issued a blunt warning about what could happen if the GOP loses control of the House.\n\n“You gotta win the midterms,” he said. “Because if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be—I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me. I’ll get impeached.”\n\nDuring his appearance on CNN’s The Source, Pence also suggested that Trump’s attack on Venezuela without congressional approval—and the unprecedented capture of its former leader, Nicolás Maduro—could become a liability for the remainder of Trump’s time in the White House.\n\nThe former vice president added that Americans are now longing for a “return to those timeless principles and values that really united the country.”\n\n“The year that Ronald Reagan won 49 states, they were the very same principles that President Trump and I governed on,” Pence said. “And whatever time I have left remaining in the public debate, I’m going to continue to be a consistent advocate for that broad, mainstream conservative agenda.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "description": "A virtually blank resume may spook employers, but job candidates don’t need a lengthy work career to land a gig—after all, one of Steven Bartlett’s best hires only had two lines on her CV.",
    "fullText": "Job-seekers may believe that an Ivy League degree or Fortune 500 work experience will land them a gig—but who they thank while walking into an interview could be more important than their educational pedigree.\n\nSteven Bartlett, the founder and host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, took a chance on an applicant with a virtually blank CV for that very reason.\n\n“I hired someone who’s CV was two lines. Their experience was zero,” Bartlett explained in a recent LinkedIn post. “Much of the reason why I gave her the job was because: She thanked the security guard by name on the way into the building.”\n\nShe continued to prove herself during the hiring process in seemingly small ways too—and those acts of humility got her the job, not her credentials.\n\n“When she didn’t know something, in the interview she said ‘I don’t know that yet, but here’s how I’d figure it out,’” Bartlett explained. “After the interview she went and self-taught herself the answer she didn’t know, and emailed it to me within hours.”\n\nThe founder took a chance on the experience-less candidate, and it didn’t take long to pay off; Bartlett said that six months later, she has proved herself as one of the best hires he’s ever made. “Fifteen years of hiring has taught me that culture fit and character is MUCH harder to hire than experience, skills or education.”\n\nBartlett’s hiring philosophy is music to the ears of entry-level Gen Zers kickstarting their careers without full-time work on their resumes.\n\nIt has long been the rule of thumb that the candidate with the best degree, most work experience, and impressive credentials will come out of job interview rounds victorious. But with years of successful and failed hires under their belt, bosses are bucking the status quo and chasing talent with human skills, work ethic, and integrity.\n\nDavid Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, isn’t drawn to candidates with the highest IQ. Instead, he said he’s in the “camp of smart enough” when hiring talent at the $282 billion company; in lieu of focusing on educational pedigree, he gravitates towards applicants who are in touch with “human elements” including the ability to connect, be resilient, and determined. Experience is also “hugely underrated” and a “big differentiator for the firm,” Solomon noted. Attending Harvard University or being the brightest in the room may be impressive, but it won’t get job candidates far at the banking titan.\n\n“You have to be smart enough, but the smartest person in the world without a whole package of other things [is] not going to navigate Goldman Sachs well, not going to be successful in Goldman Sachs over the long run,” Solomon revealed on Sequoia Capital’s Long Strange Trip podcast last year. “You can’t teach experience.”\n\nAnd Danny Meyer, the founder of global fast-casual chain Shake Shack, couldn’t agree more. To run the company’s 510 restaurant locations like a well-oiled machine, he needs talent to have a high “hospitality quotient” (HQ) over IQ. And he’s searching for six green flags in Shake Shack talent: integrity, optimism, intellectual curiosity, work ethic, empathy, and self-awareness.\n\n“I really don’t give a damn what your IQ is,” Meyer told Fortune’s Jason Del Rey at the Qualtrics X4 Summit last year. “What an IQ basically says is one’s aptitude for learning. What HQ is, is the degree to which someone is happier themselves when they provide happiness for someone else.”\n\nEven the Oracle of Omaha and longtime Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has fine-tuned his own hiring philosophy. After more than five decades helming the $1 trillion holding company, Buffett has witnessed professionals without glitzy Ivy League degrees succeed. And in planning his CEO succession last year, the investing mogul made one point clear: he wasn’t going to check the education section on candidates’ resumes.\n\n“I never look at where a candidate has gone to school. Never!” Buffett wrote in his 2025 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. “Of course, there are great managers who attended the most famous schools. But there are plenty such as Pete who may have benefited by attending a less prestigious institution or even not bothering to finish school.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "The head of Paramount Skydance's streaming product and tech is leaving the company, Business Insider has learned.\n\nVibol Hou told colleagues in the company's streaming tech Slack channel that he's leaving Paramount at the end of January.\n\n\"After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHou's exit has been anticipated within Paramount for months.\n\nIn Hou's Slack message, he referenced a previous memo from Dane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, that hinted at the move.\n\n\"Vibol has expressed interest in exploring other opportunities, and while he will remain in his role with an anticipated transition early next year, we will continue to explore new projects together,\" Glasgow wrote in a mid-October email viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHou was at Paramount or its subsidiaries for over a decade, including six years at its free streamer, Pluto TV. In that span, Paramount went through several corporate changes, from a ViacomCBS merger to the Paramount Skydance merger that closed in the summer of 2025.\n\n\"What we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message. \"But we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver.\"\n\nHou's Slack message was received warmly, with 118 \"care\" emojis, 67 classic \"red heart\" emojis, and 43 \"thank you\" emojis, among other signals of support as of early Thursday afternoon.\n\nSince Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison took over in early August, he's made several noteworthy moves, like landing UFC rights in the US and hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News.\n\nSeveral top executives have left the company as Ellison has taken control, including co-CEOs Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins, streaming head Tom Ryan, and international markets head Pam Kaufman.\n\nEllison is now focused on buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which has rejected its takeover offer eight times.\n\nParamount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead Hou's Slack message to colleagues announcing the move:\n\nAs Dane shared in his note, I'll be transitioning out of my role and leaving the company at the end of January. After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next.\n\nWhat we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy — but we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver. Yet again and again, this team showed grit, creativity, and passion. Whether you came from Pluto or another part of Streaming, the story is the same: we took on impossible problems and innovated our way through.\n\nThe culture we live — being curious about everything, feeling that hunger to solve problems, caring deeply for others, iterating constantly, and innovating in everything we do — belongs to all of you now. You should be proud of what you've achieved, and you should be confident that this is a team that can handle anything thrown its way.\n\nAs to the future, I have a lot of confidence in Dane and the vision and strategic pillars he's laid out for the year ahead. They set a strong foundation for where this organization can go over the next several years, and I'm excited to see what you all do together under his leadership.\n\nI plan to hold my last open office hours next Friday so anyone who wants to drop in, ask questions, or just say hello/goodbye has a space to do that together. In the meantime, if you'd like to stay in touch beyond my time here, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nServing alongside you has been one of the great privileges of my life, and I'll be proudly cheering you on as you write the next chapter together.",

    "fullText": "Add Rokos Capital to the list of macro hedge funds that outperformed in 2025.\n\nThe firm, run by former Brevan Howard cofounder Chris Rokos, made 21% last year, a person close to the London-based manager told Business Insider.\n\nThat follows gains of nearly 31% in 2024. The manager, which manages $22 billion, declined to comment.\n\nMacro hedge funds had a strong 2025 thanks to a choppy geopolitical environment caused by, among other things, President Donald Trump's tariff policies and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\nBridgewater Associates had its most profitable year ever, Business Insider previously reported, with gains of 33% in its flagship Pure Alpha fund. Rob Citrone's Discovery Capital was up more than 35%.\n\nRokos's former firm, Brevan Howard, lagged the macro pack, Business Insider reported. The firm's two largest funds, Master and Alpha Strategies, returned 0.8% and 8%, respectively.\n\nRokos, in a way, is a throwback to a previous iteration of the hedge fund industry, which was dominated by big star traders instead of the multistrategy managers that have come to rule the space.\n\nHe accounts for most of the risk-taking, Business Insider previously reported, and raised fees this past summer that give the firm a quarter of the trading profits generated.\n\nMacro funds are expected to have another strong year. Evanston Capital, an asset manager that invests in hedge funds, put out a report stating that the \"protectionism\" of the Trump administration and other nations \"will lead to more varied economic conditions across countries.\"\n\nBecause of this shift, there will be \"a richer set of prospective trades for skilled macro managers, especially those that can optimize trade expressions across directional, relative value, and volatility dimensions.\"",

    "title": "The old food pyramid vs. RFK Jr's 'New Pyramid': See how the guidelines have evolved over time",
    "description": "The USDA first published guidance in 1980, then a food pyramid in 1992 and a 2011 \"MyPlate\" version. Here's how they stack up to RFK's new pyramid.",
    "fullText": "For 46 years, the government has been trying to give us advice on how to eat better.\n\nIn 1980, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans were introduced, after lawmakers took notice of how some modern eating habits were fueling a rise in chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.\n\nThe very first guidelines looked like they were torn from a recipe book and were very basic principles.\n\nThe first guidelines didn't give people any visual aids for how to plan their daily diet, only prioritizing that people eat a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits and veggies, whole grains, dairy, meat, eggs, and beans.\n\n\"You need about 40 different nutrients to stay healthy,\" the guidelines said. \"Most foods contain more than one nutrient. Milk, for example, provides proteins, fats, sugars, riboflavin and other B-vitamins, vitamin A, calcium, and phosphorus — among other nutrients.\" But it doesn't have much iron or vitamin C. \"You should, therefore, eat a variety of foods to assure an adequate diet.\"\n\nIn 1992, 34 years ago, the US released its first food pyramid, giving people more specific guidance about how much to eat each day:\n\nHere, grains like bread, cereal, rice, and pasta were touted as the foundation of a balanced diet — the recommendation in the chart was six to 11 servings of grains per day.\n\nThe second priority, you were told, was to add in at least two to three servings of fruits and veggies each day.\n\nFinally, layer on top some protein from meat, eggs, beans, and nuts, as well as dairy.\n\nFat and sugar, which comprise more than a third of the typical American diet, were a side note.\n\nNutrition experts widely agree that six to 11 servings of bread per day is too much, crowding out space in your stomach for other important nutrients. Plus, they say, it's not just which food groups you eat, but the quality of each: whole grains are better than white bread, nuts and olive oil healthier fats than lard or bacon.\n\nDuring the first Obama administration, in 2011, the government introduced \"My Plate,\" which was meant to simplify our nutrition advice, but only added confusion, with four incredibly generic quadrants of a plate.\n\nThe portions of \"vegetables\" and \"grains\" were slightly larger than those of \"fruits\" and \"protein,\" and a glass of \"dairy\" was served on the side.\n\nCritics said this nutrition advice was oversimplified, with no mention of healthy versus unhealthy foods, no mention of portion sizes, and no room for diverse diets. After all, a \"grain\" could be a donut, or it could be some oatmeal.\n\nStill, nutritionists say a more specific version of this kind of \"plate method,\" trying to make roughly half of your plate vegetables and the other half a solid mix of carbs and protein, is a halfway decent diet strategy.\n\nThe Trump Administration released its 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans on Wednesday, a document that will guide federal nutrition policy for schoolchildren and military cafeterias, and also serves as a consumer's guide to healthier eating.\n\nThe big tagline this time is \"eat real food,\" a motto meant to encourage people to consume less ultra-processed foods, skip added sugar, and eat more whole foods.\n\n\"I agree entirely that we should eat real food,\" Professor Joan Sabaté, a nutrition expert who was one of the independent scientific advisors for the former 2020-2025 edition of the Dietary Guidelines, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Eat real food is an outstanding message. Yes. Reduce or eliminate highly processed foods, I think, is a good message. Reduce sugar is a good message,\" he said.\n\nSabaté is less thrilled with how the pyramid is designed to prominently favor red meat as the cornerstone of any healthy diet.\n\n\"Our eyes, when we have a document, or we have a screen in front of us, move from left to right and from top to bottom,\" he said. \"So the way this pyramid has been designed is that the first food that you see in the top left corner is beef.\"\n\nMeat can be part of a healthy diet, he said, but it shouldn't be so prominent.\n\n\"The scientific consensus is that plant-based diets are the healthiest diets as far as preventing chronic diseases. And there is no new evidence saying that animal-based diets are better for health and preventing diseases. There is no evidence of that,\" he said. \"People can also consume animal products, but they shouldn't be the majority of the energy on the plate.\"\n\n(The experts who helped draft these guidelines have disclosed ties to the beef and dairy industries.)\n\nOlive oil is a healthier fat than butter or beef tallow. Nuts are a great snack. Sabaté has concerns about kidney issues and cholesterol if people shun healthy carbs like oats, whole-grain bread, or quinoa, in favor of more meat and dairy.\n\n\"This pyramid, it prompts the American public to eat more animal products,\" he said.",

    "description": "Christopher Nolan's follow-up to \"Oppenheimer\" is an adaptation of Homer's epic \"The Odyssey,\" starring Matt Damon as Odysseus. Here's what we know.",
    "fullText": "After \"Oppenheimer\" was a critical and commercial hit, Christopher Nolan is adapting Homer's Greek epic poem \"The Odyssey\" for his next film.\n\nUniversal Pictures announced the movie in late 2024, saying it would be shot using \"brand new IMAX film technology\" and that it would arrive in theaters on July 17, 2026.\n\nHere's everything we know about the film so far.\n\nAyomikun Adekaiyero and Eve Crosbie previously contributed to this post.\n\nHomer is the attributed author of two ancient Greek poems that were composed in the 8th or 7th century BC, both of which tell the story of the Trojan War.\n\n\"The Iliad\" narrates the end of the war, while \"The Odyssey\" tells of Odysseus' 10-year struggle to return to his island home of Ithaca.\n\nDuring the journey, Odysseus and his crew fight against a man-eating cyclops, powerful giants, and sirens. They defeat witches and sea monsters, and anger the gods Zeus and Poseidon. But Odysseus has one god, Athena, on his side, trying to help him get home.\n\nMeanwhile, a band of suitors are trying to take over Odysseus' kingdom in Ithaca, supplanting his son Telemachus and convincing Penelope to marry one of them.\n\nIn a dramatic conclusion, Odysseus disguises himself as a beggar and sneaks back onto the island, where he observes the actions of the suitors before reclaiming his family and kingdom.\n\nThis will be Nolan's first film about Greek mythology, breaking away from his regular sci-fi and war films. Nolan also wrote the script.\n\nNolan's \"The Odyssey\" was partially filmed on the island of Favignana near Sicily, Variety reported.\n\nKnown in ancient times as Aegusa, or \"goat island,\" it's thought to be the inspiration for the fantastical island where Odysseus lands with his crew and stops to rest, barbecue goats, and drink wine before his run-in with the Cyclops.\n\nPer Variety, the scenes shot in Sicily are said to take up the bulk of the mythical action in the movie, while locations in the UK and Morocco are also being used.\n\nProduction wrapped in early August 2025.\n\nThat feat had previously been impossible because the cameras are extremely noisy.\n\nNolan, who has always loved shooting on IMAX, challenged the company to come up with a quieter camera. Damon told the \"New Heights\" podcast in January what it was like working with the new camera.\n\n\"IMAX cameras are really loud. It sounds like a blender, like a Cuisinart in your face when the camera's close to you,\" Damon told hosts Jason and Travis Kelce. So there's never been these dialogue [scenes in IMAX]. We couldn't have this conversation with a normal IMAX camera because you wouldn't be able to hear us.\"\n\n\"They built this giant thing around the IMAX for those dialogue scenes and a system of mirrors so your eye line would be close to the camera and you could talk to the other actor,\" Damon continued. \"The amount of work that went into figuring out how to do [that], because he wanted to do 100 percent IMAX, and he did it!\"\n\nSeveral filmmakers have brought Homer's work to screen over the years, including the Oscar-winning Coen brothers and Oscar-nominated German director Wolfgang Petersen.\n\nPetersen's \"Troy,\" which premiered in 2004 and starred Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom, was based on Homer's \"The Illiad.\" It was the most commercially successful Homer adaptation, grossing $497 million worldwide. However, it received mixed reviews, with some criticizing it for not translating Homer's story well. The film holds a 53% Tomatometer rating on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nPitt told The New York Times Magazine in 2019 that he was \"disappointed\" by the film, and the experience made him pivot toward \"quality stories\" for the rest of his career.\n\nThe Coen Brothers' \"O Brother, Where Are Thou?\" and the 2004 \"The Spongebob Squarepants Movie\" are two other Hollywood that are movies loosely based on \"The Odyssey.\"\n\nHomer's work has also been adapted into multiple TV series, including 1997's \"The Odyssey,\" which starred Christopher Lee and Vanessa Williams.\n\nThe most recent adaptation was \"The Return,\" directed by Italian filmmaker Uberto Pasolini and starring Ralph Fiennes as Odysseus. The film, which is a retelling of the final sections of the epic poem, received positive reviews from critics but made less than $1 million worldwide.",

    "description": "The LLC moved as California's ultrarich weigh leaving ahead of a proposed tax on billionaires that would take effect retroactively starting January 1.",
    "fullText": "An entity tied to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page moved out of California at the end of 2025, beating the deadline on a proposed wealth tax of the state's rich and powerful.\n\nT-Rex LLC, formed in 2006 and linked to Brin and Page, converted out of California into a Delaware LLC called T-Rex Holdings on December 24, 2025, according to a California filing reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior filings over the past 20 years listed Brin and Page as managers of the LLC at a Palo Alto address. In the conversion filing, T-Rex Holdings listed an address in Reno, Nevada, as its principal office, with Brin and Page both remaining managers.\n\nRepresentatives for Brin and Page didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes as California's wealthiest residents are weighing whether to leave the state. A proposed ballot measure would make the roughly 200 California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion pay a one-time 5% tax. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. The measure attempts to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nEarlier this week, Business Insider first reported that Page severed ties with California in late December by converting his family office out of the state and incorporating it in Delaware. He has also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures.\n\nIt's unclear what the entity tied to Brin and Page does. The filing describes T-Rex Holdings as a \"management company.\" Like other ultrawealthy executives, Brin and Page have used LLCs as flexible vehicles to hold assets or manage investments, often with little public disclosure. The LLC's name may be a reference to Stan, a bronze T. rex statue that presides over Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nBrin, who cofounded Google with Page in 1998, is associated with several other entities in California, including the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and Bayshore Global Management, which acts as his family office. Filings do not show any other entity associated with Brin leaving California.\n\nPage and Brin are, respectively, the second and fourth-richest people on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Each has a net worth exceeding $250 billion.\n\nAfter stepping back from executive roles in 2019, the two have taken differing paths. Brin has returned to hands-on work at Google. Page is a controlling shareholder, but has remained outside the company's daily operations.\n\nIf the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November. If approved by voters, it will apply retroactively to the beginning of the year, meaning those who wish to avoid the tax would need to have been out of the state by the end of December 2025.\n\nCalifornia law determines residency based a variety of factors, including time spent in California and any substantial business dealings.\n\nA December 11 letter from celebrity attorney Alex Spiro to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, seen by Business Insider, urged the governor to stop the proposed tax: \"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"",

    "title": "What Trump's plan to ban defense dividends and raise the military budget could mean for your portfolio",
    "description": "Defense stocks pay relatively high dividends, but there are alternative areas of the market for investors to consider if they want steady income.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump sent defense stocks on a roller coaster ride this week, and his recent executive orders on defense firms and his calls for more defense spending could impact investors' portfolios.\n\nThe president signed an order aimed at restricting some financial behavior among defense contractors, including an executive order that bans defense firms from issuing dividend payments and doing stock buybacks until they deliver a \"superior product.\" Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that he wants the US military budget could raised to a record $1.5 trillion next year.\n\nBoth developments have implications for investors who have money in the defense sector, which is known for paying relatively high dividends. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has an annual dividend yield of around 2%, compared to about 1% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere's the rundown of how investors should be thinking about the latest news — and what it means for their portfolios.\n\nFor the most part, investors shouldn't be thinking about their long-term investments too differently. Trump's push to ban dividend payments seems largely hypothetical, and it's unclear how the president will enforce such a rule, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"It feels as though this was making another random social media announcement that will likely die on the vine,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I don't know you need to make a rush to judgment in terms of changing your long-term investment plans.\"\n\nBesides the threat of barring dividend payments, Trump's announcements on social media seem largely positive for defense investors, José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. He added that those who aren't dependent on dividend payments should remain invested in the sector, pointing to the potential for growth.\n\n\"I think that investors can look forward to improved quality from those companies, in the best-case scenario,\" he told BI.\n\nIf defense companies fall in line and pause dividend payments, that could hurt investors who specifically hold dividend-paying stocks for regular income, Torres said.\n\nBut those investors can move to other dividend-paying areas of the market. Torres encouraged investors to consider value sectors with high dividend yields, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nB. Riley's Hogan encouraged investors to consider areas like energy, consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and other parts of the industrial sector, a broader umbrella that covers defense stocks.\n\nDividend ETFs, which track a basket of dividend-paying companies, are also an option for investors chasing dividends, he added.\n\n\"There's a lot of dividend darlings for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I think investors, if in fact they feel nervous about the potential for dividend cuts or the removal of dividends in any space, as unlikely as that prospect seems, there are ways to navigate around that.\"\n\nInvestors should be watching their bond investments, Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said.\n\nBerezin said that the significant increase in defense spending could lead to a rise in bond yields, which would mean bond prices could fall.\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also said he believed bond investors should \"absolutely\" be concerned about the more robust military budget, which could raise long-end bond yields in particular.\n\nLong-end bond yields have climbed in recent years as concerns have risen about the US deficit and rising levels of government debt. Higher debt levels make investors more wary of purchasing long-term US Treasurys, which means yields need to rise to attract investors. Heavy borrowing and spending are also inflationary, which could push yields higher down the road as the central bank adjusts monetary policy to keep prices under control.\n\nTorres didn't recommend selling bonds at the moment. He believes concerns around debt have caused long-end bond yields in the US to be \"too high,\" and he expects those yields to ease soon.\n\n\"I'm a bond bull at this juncture,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump took aim at defense contractors on Wednesday in an executive order.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is targeting the bank accounts of defense contractor CEOs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order outlining new rules for defense contractors that would ban stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget\" — as well as limit executive compensation.\n\nThe order stipulates that in future contracts, if the Secretary of War were unsatisfied with a company's performance, executive base salaries would be capped at current levels. Future contracts would also ensure compensation \"not be tied to short-term financial metrics\" and instead be \"linked to an on-time delivery, increased production, and all necessary facilitation of investments and operating improvements.\"\n\nThe goal, per the executive order, is to increase the speed of innovation at defense companies, rather than focus on corporate profits.\n\nTrump also took aim at the leaders of defense contractors in a series of posts on Truth Social on Wednesday.\n\n\"Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military,\" Trump wrote. \"Salaries, Stock Options, and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives.\"\n\nHe proposed that no executive should earn \"in excess of $5 million\" until their production speed and maintenance improve, though the executive order did not cap pay at that exact amount.\n\nThe leaders of the big five defense contractors — Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly known as Raytheon), Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics — each earned more than $18 million in total compensation in 2024, the most recent year for which data is available. Their total income was a combination of salary, incentives, stock options, and other forms of compensation, including the value of security services and changes in the value of pension funds.\n\nWhile exceeding the $5 million cap proposed by Trump by magnitudes, the CEOs' compensation pales in comparison to that of some other business leaders.\n\nDozens of CEOs earned more than them in 2024. James Robert Anderson, who runs materials manufacturer Coherent, had a pay package of more than $100 million last year. The CEOs of Starbucks, GE, and Microsoft each made more than $75 million.\n\nExecutive pay and stock transactions are part of Trump's larger plans for the military. On Wednesday evening, he said on Truth Social that America's military budget should be increased to $1.5 trillion in 2027, up from the record 2026 defense budget of $901 billion.\n\nThat sent defense stocks climbing on Thursday morning, gaining back what they'd lost following the signing of the executive order.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider regarding the order, a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin said the company \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nBoeing and General Dynamics declined to comment, and Northrop Grumman and RTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Tin Can, the \"landline\" for kids, got 100 times its normal call volume on Christmas. It crashed. Kids were upset. Now, it's almost back to normal.",
    "fullText": "The Tin Can phone, a \"landline\" designed for kids, is having growing pains.\n\nIt's become so popular that its service crashed on Christmas, leaving kids upset that they couldn't make calls on the gifts they'd just opened under the tree.\n\nTin Can has emailed customers at least three times since the holiday hiccup with updates on fixes in the works.\n\n\"Call volume on Christmas Day increased more than 100x from the start of the month, which impacted people's abilities to set up their devices or make calls,\" Tin Can founder Chet Kittleson told Business Insider. \"Despite spending months and months preparing for it, we didn't get it all right.\"\n\nMost services are back up and running, he said. But there are still some issues with call quality and reliability. \"This is our biggest priority and the full team is working around the clock to restore service,\" he said.\n\nThe buzzy phone was launched in the fall of 2024 and spread quickly through word of mouth — especially in Facebook groups focused on parenting. The phones, which are colorful and corded, cost $75. It's free to call other Tin Can users (or you can pay $10 a month to call outside lines, similar to VoIP), which is what makes the service so popular with parents: They can create a sort of Tin Can closed circuit.\n\nFor Maria Pahuja, a parent in Richmond, Virginia, everything was working fine when she installed the Tin Can phone on Christmas Eve morning. \"It worked great, the kids were using it,\" she said. \"Then, Christmas morning, it stopped working.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you'd pick it up, and there would be a dial tone, you would call, and nothing would happen. Once in a while, a call would go through, and then two minutes later another call wouldn't,\" she said. \"It wasn't consistent.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Conz Preti bought a Tin Can for her kids in the fall and is a big fan of it. She was delighted how, on a recent snow day, her kids used it to organize playdates for sledding — all on their own, without the parents having to act as social secretary.\n\n(Full disclosure: I have also ordered one for my own kids. In a nod to what the company said is a paced timeline to make sure it can catch up with any tech issues, mine isn't scheduled to arrive until February.)\n\nThe concept of the Tin Can is appealing to parents like Conz and me, who have kids too young for cellphones but are old enough to want to communicate with friends on their own. Although it's similar to an actual landline, it's not one: Tin Can works on WiFi. Parents can set it to make and receive calls only to and from approved contacts. And it can also be programmed to have a time limit and be silent during quiet hours.\n\nThe company was founded by Kittleson, Max Blumen, and Graeme Davies based on a desire to create something for their own kids. They raised $3.5 million in funding for the company from investors, including Pioneer Square Ventures, Newfund Capital, Mother Ventures, and Solid Foundation. Since December 2025, they have raised an additional $12 million from Greylock Partners, bringing the total to $15.5 million, the company said.\n\nIn late August 2025, Kittleson told Business Insider they had sold \"tens of thousands\" of the devices so far. The company didn't have an updated sales figure to share.\n\nEven the disappointment of the tech issues with the phone is a teaching moment, one parent said.\n\n\"Part of what we're trying to teach kids is patience and accountability,\" said Joy Engel, a parent of a 5- and 8-year-old who lives outside Portland, Maine. She received the Tin Can she ordered over the summer on the first day of Hannukkah, and her kids have loved it, even with the service outages in late December.\n\n\"The company has been so forthright in what they say and how they've communicated and stopped charging people. That's accountability,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a patience there that you're teaching them that you can't always get what you want right now. ''Your friend's not there, that stinks. You're gonna have to wait and call them back. The phone doesn't work. That stinks. You're going to have to wait and try again,\" she said.\n\nFor now, the Tin Can is backordered until April. Not because of manufacturing constraints, Kittleson told Business Insider, but to pace the onboarding of the service.\n\nUpdate: January 8, 2026 — Tin Can in December raised an additional $12 million, to bring its total fundraise to $15.5 million, the company said",

    "fullText": "The battle to become the top micro-drama app in the US is heating up.\n\nDramaBox, one of the leading producers of the short-video format filled with soapy tropes, has been seeking fresh funding from US backers, according to two people with direct knowledge of its efforts.\n\nOne said DramaBox's fundraising goal was $100 million with a $500 million valuation.\n\nDramaBox is part of Singapore-based StoryMatrix, and is behind titles like \"A Deal with the Hockey Captain\" and \"The Lost Heir: A Christmas Reckoning\" that it monetizes through one-off payments, subscriptions (usually $20 a week), and ads.\n\nDramaBox did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nExecutives at DramaBox told Business Insider in September that the company was profitable and that their ambition was to become the most popular micro-drama platform for Americans. They aimed to do so by working with Hollywood filmmakers and diversifying into new storytelling styles and genres, such as series for families and choose-your-own-adventure-style dramas.\n\nIndustry reports regularly list DramaBox as one of the top two micro-drama apps, alongside fellow Asian import ReelShort. Analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated that DramaBox generated $120 million in global in-app revenue in the first quarter of 2025, just behind ReelShort's $130 million. DramaBox countered in the September interview that its numbers were higher, without sharing specifics.\n\nThe streaming consulting firm Owl & Co. estimated that the format had generated $1.3 billion in the US in 2025, mostly from direct payments from viewers.\n\nDramaBox already has a connection to Hollywood's most blue-chip company, Disney, which has invested in DramaBox through its selective accelerator program. Disney said in late 2025 that it was in talks with DramaBox to adapt young adult fantasy novels into original micro dramas and was exploring adapting music albums into vertical short videos.\n\nInvestors have been placing bets elsewhere in the space as well:\n\nMeta's Instagram is testing the micro drama format in India with a series. TikTok, which is already widely used by short dramas for marketing, added a section called TikTok Minis where you can binge on bite-sized series without leaving the app.\n\nDespite the format's burgeoning popularity, there are those who question its long-term viability. Some investors told Business Insider they had held back from the space because of concerns that the format wouldn't succeed in areas beyond its core of female-targeted romances.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, arguing the move would lower interest rates and monthly housing payments.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said the directive was possible because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have \"$200 billion in cash.\" He added the bond purchases would help \"make the cost of owning a home more affordable.\"\n\nIt was not clear who Trump meant by his \"representatives,\" or which entity would carry out the purchases. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.\n\nTrump's proposal for his representatives to buy housing bonds comes on the heels of a Wednesday statement made by the president, in which he said he would ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that many housing economists say such a ban would do little to improve national housing affordability. It is unclear what effect Trump's latest proposal would have on the market.\n\nRichard Green, director and chair of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, told Business Insider that Trump's proposal doesn't go far enough to solve the fundamental problem with American housing, which is that there simply aren't enough homes for each person who wants to buy one.\n\nHowever, he added, even the $200 billion proposal is more symbolic than substantive.\n\n\"When the Fed was involved in buying mortgages, they were buying trillions, right? So this is a gesture, I suppose,\" Green said. \"And of course, if you drop interest rates down, it will show up at higher house prices, which means that down payment becomes more difficult.\"\n\n\"So it's not like magic, that if you push down mortgage interest rates, that you're going to make housing less or more affordable,\" Green added. \"But the big thing is that $200 billion sounds like a big number, but in context, it's not all that much.\"\n\nTrump's plan also came just a day after he signed an executive order that bans defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends unless they meet certain standards.\n\nThe approach fits with a broader shift in Trump's second-term economic playbook, as previously reported by Business Insider's Emily Stewart. The Trump administration seems to have embraced a more interventionist style of capitalism, with the federal government taking a more active role in markets, including holding direct stakes in private companies.\n\nTrump's latest rhetoric also appears to target the affordability crisis as frustration over prices builds and as midterm elections near.\n\nHousing, food, and everyday expenses remain stubbornly expensive since Trump took office for the second time, and his tariffs did not help. Zohran Mamdani, the new mayor of NYC, who had a meeting with Trump, notably won by running on universal childcare and affordable housing. According to a poll by Lake Research Partners in October 2025, support for affordability and living-wage policies in competitive swing districts is high and would give candidates who run on economic issues an advantage.",

    "fullText": "on January 8, 2026 at 11:17AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nSeason 1 Reloaded is live in Black Ops 7 and Warzone, bringing the wasteland of Fallout to Call of Duty with a brand-new collaboration event. For a limited time, players can earn Fallout operator skins and other themed rewards by unlocking them in free and paid event passes. Here's a look at all Fallout rewards in Call of Duty and how you unlock them during the event.\n\nCall of Duty's Fallout event runs from now until January 29. This adds operator skins and cosmetics themed around Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show. While there are plenty of free rewards to earn, you'll need to purchase the paid \"premium\" pass for 1,100 CoD Points ($10) if you want to unlock all items for the event.\n\nThere are 20 rewards in total for the Fallout event. There are 10 rewards in the free pass, and 10 more optional rewards can be unlocked with the paid pass. The highlights of the free pass include two vault dweller operator skins and the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun. The paid pass is required to unlock Maximus and The Ghoul characters from the show.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the character, Lucy MacLean, will arrive as a shop bundle at a later date. Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.\n\nAll Fallout event rewards can be seen below. This is an XP-based event, so you'll simply need to grind XP across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. For multiplayer, objective modes like Kill Confirmed and Domination work best, while Plunder and Casual battle royale modes will yield more XP for Warzone. This is also a good time to use double XP tokens if you have them.\n\nIt's worth noting that this crossover features Fallout-themed game modes and events across multiplayer, Zombies, Endgame, and Warzone. Make sure to check out all the details about Season 1 Reloaded's new content, and the full patch notes can be found here.\n\nThis is an operator skin for David Mason, putting him in Fallout's iconic blue vault suit. This is a free instant reward you'll get automatically at the start of the event.\n\nThis is the Power Armor skin for Maximus with his helmet on. The skin is a paid reward that you unlock automatically if you purchase the paid event pass.\n\nThis reward is a loading screen with iconic Fallout-themed artwork, and it is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is a cosmetic blueprint for the Flatline MK II melee weapon, which makes it look like the Torch Blade used by the Brotherhood of Steel. This is unlocked in the paid pass.\n\nThis reward is a one-hour double weapon XP token, and it is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is a finishing move that lets your character wield a minigun to takedown opponents. This is available to unlock in the paid pass.\n\nThis is an animated emblem of Fallout's Vault Boy. The reward is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is a weapon blueprint for the AK-27 assault rifle, and it's themed around the Brotherhood of Steel. The reward is unlocked in the paid pass.\n\nThis reward is a one-hour double XP token, and it is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis Maximus skin features the character from the show in his power armor, but the helmet is off to make the character's face visible.

The reward is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is an animated calling card featuring Maximus launching upwards in a power armor suit.

The reward is available to unlock in the paid pass.\n\nThe final reward in the free pass is the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun.\n\nThe Sturmwolf 45 is basically a renamed variant of Call of Duty's popular UMP45. This is a full-auto submachine gun, and Activision describes it as being \"highly accurate and easy to use.\"\n\nThe final reward of the paid pass is The Ghoul operator from the Fallout TV show.",

Now, some outlets are putting forth theories that there may be a new Witcher 3 expansion to fill the gap between the present and the fourth game's release.\nIGN Poland and Eurogamer separately released stories suggesting that The Witcher 3 will get its first expansion since Blood and Wine was released in 2016. Eurogamer's report suggests that the drive to release something new this year is because CD Projekt Red is behind sales goals that would trigger financial incentives for its employees.\nThat program has been mentioned by the company itself, which stated in a 2025 investor's call that, \"There is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program.",

No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist.\nSimilar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as \"Light Green.\" Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors.",

Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments.\nDuring a recent appearance on the Button Mash podcast, Schreier said, \"The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete.

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "OpenAI  invites you to hand over your medical information. Maybe don't?",
    "fullText": "This week, OpenAI announced its new ChatGPT Health feature, which will let users upload their medical records and ask health related questions. However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons.\n\nThe new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n\nCurrently, there's a waitlist to At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.",

    "title": "There's Actually a Way to Mix and Match Your Cordless Tool Batteries",
    "description": "Tool brands each have their own closed battery systems. You don't have to put up with that.",
    "fullText": "When shopping for cordless power tools, you'd think you could simply purchase the best option of each to fit your needs. But there's a big problem that makes this a lot harder (and more expensive) than it should be: battery incompatibility. By design, you can’t simply pop a Ryobi battery into a DeWalt tool and expect it to work. Engineering decisions aside, using proprietary batteries allows companies to create a sort of obligatory brand loyalty, forcing you to stick with their line of tools unless you want to invest in a whole new set of batteries for every new tool you buy.\n\nIf you've been building your cordless tool collection for some time, you may wind up with four or five different chargers and multiple batteries cluttering your workspace. And that clutter can be expensive, because you wind up buying more chargers and batteries than you might not need if batteries were interchangeable.\n\nBut it turns out they are, sort of. You can actually swap batteries between brands—you just need the right adapters.\n\nThere are two kinds of battery adapters to consider:\n\nInter-brand adapters allow you to use one brand’s batteries in another brand’s tool (like DeWalt batteries in Milwaukee tools).\n\nVoltage adapters allow you to use a different voltage battery than the tool expects (say, a 20-volt battery in a 18-volt tool).\n\nThese adapters are a fairly simple solution to the problem of incompatible battery systems. If you have a lot of DeWalt tools, for example, you can purchase a Milwaukee tool without a battery (which will be cheaper) and just use an adapter to plug in one of the DeWalt batteries you already have.\n\nOf course, these batteries weren’t specifically designed for these tools, so there can be some trade-offs. While tool performance has been found to be broadly similar (and some tools even performed better when using batteries from different brands), for some tools (like grinders and some circular saws) there’s a dropoff in power and performance when using an adapter. That said, you might not notice it if you're just looking to tackling simple DIY projects around the house.\n\nAnother caveat to consider: You might lose some features. Some tools are designed to communicate with the battery to modulate power draw in order to extend the life of the battery, and using an adapter will remove this functionality. But again, if you’re simply using a power drill for basic maintenance tasks, this might not be a huge issue for you.\n\nIf you’ve got a bunch of disparate tool brands, of course, buying multiple adapters might not seem like much of an improvement over your collection of batteries and chargers. If this is you, consider something like the Ceenr PDNation Universal Battery System, which provides an 18-volt battery and a series of adapters that allow it to be used in a wide range of power tools, including major brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee, and DeWalt.\n\nFor example, you can buy a battery with an adapter for DeWalt tools, then buy a second adapter for the same battery that will work with Makita tools. This means you can standardize on one battery system for pretty much any tool you buy (it’s not a truly universal system, since you’re dependent on the range of adapters they offer, but it’s probably close enough for most people).\n\nAs with other adapters, there can be some performance loss using a universal adapter, but by and large, it’s probably not a big issue if you’re doing work around the house, as opposed to working professionally on a job site.",

    "title": "Google's Getting Rid of a Way to Import Third-Party Accounts Into Gmail",
    "description": "This month, Gmail is ending POP support, which can break syncing your email from third-party accounts.",
    "fullText": "If you've been running several email accounts through your Gmail, you might want to double-check your settings this month—that's because Google is ending support for the POP3 protocol that can sync emails from third-party accounts. And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.\n\nPOP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.\n\nIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\n\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.\n\nUse IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.\n\nThe IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n\nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.",

    "title": "Use RICE to Prioritize Your To-Dos",
    "description": "The RICE method requires a little math, but it might be just the thing you need to tackle the new year.",
    "fullText": "Whenever you have a bunch of looming tasks—as many of us do at the start of the new year, when everyone actually \"circles back\" on the things we've been putting off—having a structured to-do list is an essential part of getting everything done. Determining what goes on that list and in what order, though, is a task all its own. I've covered a lot of ways to do that, but if you're stuck with a high volume of important responsibilities, you need an approach that matches the complexity of what you're trying to do—and that's where the RICE method comes into play.\n\nRICE, as you probably guessed, is an acronym. Here's what it stands for:\n\nReach: How many people or parts of your life or project this task will impact\n\nImpact: How meaningful that impact will be if and when it's done correctly\n\nConfidence: How sure you are about your estimates of the other three factors\n\nEffort: The time, energy, knowledge, and resources required\n\nA unique combination of those factors is going to give you guidance on which tasks are the most crucial to prioritize, which is helpful when you're overloaded by information and dread, unable to think about when or where to get started.\n\nI won't lie to you: This method is more convoluted than some of the others I've covered in the past. I might even recommend trying a simpler prioritization technique, like the Eisenhower matrix, before you try this one and only whip this out if Eisenhower or its peers aren't given you solid results. RICE takes a little time—and that's because you need to do some math.\n\nStart by writing down all your tasks. Under each, you're assigning numbers. The Reach score will be the number of people or parts of your life or project that the task will impact and the Impact score is a 3 (massive impact), 2 (high), 1 (medium), .5 (low), or .25 (minimal impact). Confidence should be a 100, 80, or 50, to represent the percentage of confidence you feel in your estimates and abilities. You can use any number between 0 and 100, but falling back on those three just makes it easier. Most adherents of this method use a complicated math equation (determining \"person-months\") for Effort, but I'm going to simplify that for you. Score it the same way you scored Impact, with a 3 for multiple days or resources, 2 for a day, 1 for half a day, .5 for an hour, and .25 for a half an hour or less. You can also score Reach that way if you're working on a personal project and your results won't necessarily reach a big number of people. In that case, think about the different areas of your life or personal goals it will affect and use that 3-to-.25 scale.\n\nThat part is all subjective, similar to using the ABCDE method to assign grades to your to-dos. It can't be avoided—you won't know the true resources required or reach of the project until it's done—but you can quantify it a bit.\n\nNext, you do math. It's R x I x C divided by E. You'll end up with a numerical score for each task. Rank the tasks in descending order, with the biggest numbers first. Obviously, you may find that some can't be completed until others are done, so use your discretion there, but for the most part, you've just created a clear outline of which things will have the biggest impact and reach and you can at least know where to start. Add each into your calendar using time boxing and time blocking, then get after it. Knowing you have a plan of attack is half the motivational battle.",

    "description": "Find out who got a 10 and who is facing an uncertain international future with our Ashes player ratings.",
    "fullText": "The Ashes series is over and, once again, it finishes with Australia holding the urn.\n\nEngland did avoid a clean sweep with victory in Melbourne but Australia reasserted their dominance in Sydney this week.\n\nHere we hand out player ratings for the whole series.\n\nZak Crawley – 5 – Averaged 27, which was entirely predictable at the beginning of the series. Did not live up to the billing of a man backed for Australia and should not be guaranteed a place for the home summer.\n\nBen Duckett – 3 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best all-format batters in the world, leaves with career at a crossroads. Did not pass 50, dropped catches and was caught on video in Noosa. Now goes to England's white-ball tours and the Indian Premier League, when a break might be the smart option.\n\nJacob Bethell – 7 – Where has he been? How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.\n\nJoe Root – 7 – Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.\n\nJamie Smith – 3 – Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?\n\nWill Jacks – 5 – Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?\n\nBrydon Carse – 6 – A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.\n\nMatthew Potts – 1 – Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.\n\nJosh Tongue – 7 – Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.\n\nMark Wood – 2 – A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?\n\nJofra Archer – 6 – Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.\n\nOllie Pope – 3 – Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.\n\nGus Atkinson – 3 – One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.\n\nShoaib Bashir – 0 – Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nThe Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction\n\nJake Weatherald – 4 – Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.\n\nTravis Head – 10 – The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.\n\nSteve Smith – 7 – Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 5 – A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.\n\nAlex Carey – 9 – One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.\n\nBeau Webster – 5 – When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.\n\nMichael Neser – 7 – Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.\n\nMitchell Starc – 10 – This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.\n\nScott Boland – 7 – Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.\n\nBrendan Doggett – 4 – Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.\n\nPat Cummins – 6 – Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.\n\nNathan Lyon – 4 – Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.\n\nJosh Inglis – 3 – Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.\n\nJhye Richardson – 2 – Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs. Should get another chance.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win",

    "fullText": "Ethan Nwaneri had a breakout season last term when the Arsenal forward deputised so impressively for the injured Bukayo Saka.\n\nHe played mostly on the right wing and scored nine goals in 37 appearances in all competitions to mark himself out as one of England's most talented young players.\n\nNwaneri, now 18, also became the second-youngest goalscorer in Champions League history when he netted against Girona last January at 17 years and 314 days old - only Jude Bellingham did so at a younger age.\n\nThe England Under-21 forward is the youngest player to feature in the Premier League thanks to a debut against Brentford at the age of 15 years and 181 days in September 2022.\n\nSo, as well as those admirable performances in 2024-25, it also feels as though Nwaneri has been on the first-team scene for a long time.\n\nYet this season, his involvement has been limited.\n\nNwaneri has made 11 appearances in all competitions, starting just three times across matches in the Carabao Cup and Champions League. He has played just 446 minutes and has scored one goal.\n\nThe Gunners spent about £250m bringing in eight players over the summer to increase the depth in their squad, with Martin Zubimendi, Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and even the younger Noni Madueke 'win now signings'.\n\nIt has worked, with Arsenal five points clear at the top of the Premier League and with a perfect record in the Champions League.\n\nMikel Arteta's side have won 23, drawn four and lost just two of their 29 matches and if they beat Liverpool in the league on Thursday, they will be eight points clear of Manchester City.\n\nBut those experienced signings, and Arsenal's success, has come at a cost to younger members of the squad like Nwaneri.",

    "fullText": "An influential Manchester United fan group is planning a protest against the ownership, which it accuses of \"turning the club into a circus\".\n\nThe 1958 group was responsible for protests at the way United was being run which attracted thousands in March last year - although they scrapped a plan to repeat it before the opening home game of this season against Arsenal.\n\nDiscontent against minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe been growing in recent weeks, and the appointment and subsequent dismissal of Ruben Amorim has triggered a call to protest before the Red Devils play Fulham on 1 February.\n\nFans held up an anti-Ratcliffe banner at Turf Moor on Wednesday before the 2-2 draw with Burnley, when supporters also sang vicious songs against co-chairman Joel Glazer.\n\n\"After lurching from one disaster to another, Ratcliffe comes across as an incompetent clown turning the club into a circus,\" said the 1958 group in a statement.\n\n\"Instead of best in class, we're a laughing stock.\n\n\"It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United. On the pitch, we are watching mediocre performances from an average team drifting without identity, direction, or ambition. Off it, the chaos is even worse.\"\n\nSenior United officials are continuing their search for a caretaker boss to replace Amorim, although sources with an understanding of the situation say substantive conversations with front-runners Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are yet to take place.\n\nSources close to Ratcliffe defend him, pointing to the £250m of his own money he has invested in the club, including a complete renovation of United's Carrington training complex, as proof he is genuine in his wish to drive the club forward.\n\nHowever, others point to the decision to retain Erik ten Hag following the 2024 FA Cup final win over Manchester City, invest £200m in new players, then sack the Dutchman just nine games into the new Premier League season, and then doing something similar with Amorim after last term's 15th-placed finish, as clear examples of flawed thinking.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli has apologised for trying to push injured Liverpool defender Conor Bradley off the pitch during Thursday's 0-0 draw between the teams.\n\nNorthern Ireland international Bradley landed awkwardly near the touchline when chasing the ball in stoppage time, falling to the ground and immediately clutching his knee.\n\nMartinelli then dropped the ball on the full-back before shoving him in the back in an attempt to get him off the playing surface to allow the game to continue.\n\nThat action sparked a melee between the two sets of players, with Martinelli and Liverpool's Ibrahima Konate both yellow-carded for their involvement.\n\nAfter receiving treatment, Bradley was taken away on a stretcher and was later seen leaving Emirates Stadium on crutches and with a knee brace.\n\nFormer Manchester United players Gary Neville and Roy Keane were both highly critical of Martinelli, with Neville saying his actions were \"absolutely disgraceful\" and describing the Arsenal winger as an \"idiot\".\n\nMartinelli later issued an apology on social media, saying the two players had been in contact and he had already said sorry.\n\n\"I really didn't understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment,\" Martinelli posted on Instagram.\n\n\"I want to say I'm deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.\"\n\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot defended Martinelli after the match, suggesting the wider issue of time-wasting in football may have led to the flashpoint.\n\n\"I don't know Gabriel Martinelli, but he comes across as a nice guy,\" said Slot.\n\n\"I think the problem for him - and it's a problem in general in football - is that there is so much time-wasting and players pretending that they are injured in the final parts of the game and during the game, that you can sometimes be annoyed if you want to try to score a goal that you think the player is time-wasting.\n\n\"You cannot ask Martinelli to think so clear in the 94th minute.\"",

    "fullText": "It was after Liverpool's 4-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven at Anfield in November that Steven Gerrard said his old team just kept on \"bleeding\".\n\nA ninth defeat in 12 matches for Liverpool was inflicted that night, but Liverpool have stemmed the painful flow and are now 10 games unbeaten since being embarrassed by the Dutch champions.\n\nWith a spirited display in Thursday's goalless draw against leaders Arsenal, Arne Slot's side became the first visiting team to take a Premier League point at Emirates Stadium since Manchester City in September.\n\nConor Bradley's first-half effort which struck the crossbar was the closest either side went to scoring, while Liverpool were the better team in the second half with 66% possession.\n\nWithout a recognised striker, however, they lacked a focal point to their attacks.\n\nHad Hugo Ekitike been fit enough to feature, the visitors could perhaps have taken the win, though this was still a decent night for Liverpool.\n\nAfter poor showings in recent draws against Leeds and Fulham, last season's champions delivered a performance from which Slot can take plenty of positives.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch were solid in midfield and Milos Kerkez had arguably his best game for the club as he dealt superbly with the threat of Bukayo Saka.\n\nDefensively, Liverpool prevented Arsenal having an attempt in the second half until stoppage time. Mikel Arteta's side have now failed to score against Liverpool in both games this season.\n\n\"I think Arne Slot will be absolutely delighted with the performance of the players,\" said ex-Reds forward Daniel Sturridge on Sky Sports.\n\n\"You've got to give him credit for his game plan. They weathered the storm for the first 20 minutes. After that, their work rate, how tenacious they were, it was a very experienced performance and they showed why they are champions.\n\n\"They lacked the cutting edge up front but had very positive moments. Jeremie Frimpong was a threat all night but missed the final pass. Florian Wirtz was very good, picked up a load of pockets and was very clean tonight. The list goes on. The defence was magnificent.\n\n\"They stopped attacks all night and I think the manager and players should be very proud of themselves. They performed exceptionally.\"",

England coach Brendon McCullum has already admitted it.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): He kept a clean sheet against Sunderland, and he's really starting to command as a regular number one. He's starting to show that he commands the area in the right way. Obviously a penalty save always helps.\n\nMichael Keane (Everton): The guy they tried to get rid of, they guy they wanted to replace, the guy they want to move on from, the guy who keeps telling them no. He keeps scoring, he keeps delivering. I think he's gotten really comfortable within his own skin as a human.\n\nIbrahima Konate (Liverpool): I thought this was a vintage Konate performance. Not only did he deliver physically, which we know he can do, but he was in a position to look after his team-mates. When Gabriel Martinelli tried to crudely push Conor Bradley off the pitch at the end, I'm glad Konate stuck up for his team. He got back physically, wasn't a liability and stood up strong.\n\nMax Alleyne (Manchester City): The young man played really, really well against a tough Brighton team. He never got caught wanting and had an opportunity to score. He conducted himself well, and I thought it was a glowing endorsement from Pep Guardiola to start him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): The best player on the pitch. People will say: \"Oh what about him and him?\" But I don't care. If you play football and watch football, you know that Szoboszlai was everywhere. Did the dirty stuff, the horrible stuff, but was one of the best attacking options for Liverpool apart from Jeremie Frimpong. He dictated the play, it was a very good performance.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): He's just a beast. The work that he has done, and the work Eddie Howe has done on him, is just frightening. He keeps popping up with important goals, but remember that they signed him as a striker. He's just turned into a beast of a midfielder who runs all over you.\n\nBrenden Aaronson (Leeds): A couple of goals - though he was at fault for the handball, which was only down to him not being brave enough to take one in the face. Scored two and has won over the Leeds faithful. He's having a really good season and has borne the brunt of some unfair criticism from Leeds fans.\n\nFerdi Kadioglu (Brighton): He was a thorn in Nathan Ake's side all day. On another day, he'd be a bit lucky and score a goal or two, but he was excellent. Brighton weren't scared of Manchester City at all.\n\nHarvey Barnes (Newcastle): Two goals, the second being the match-winner, which was absolute limbs and scenes. He's another player where you're like: \"Go on, show us who you are.\" Unfortunately he always leaves you a little bit wanting. I'm always thinking there's more to come from him. That's not to take anything away from his goals.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Sixteen goals this season. We spoke about him last week - he's flying. Scoring again, carrying Brentford. They've got a real chance as long as he stays fit and continues doing what he's doing.\n\nBenjamin Sesko (Manchester United): He has had a torrid start to his Manchester United career. But he scored two goals at Burnley and you have to give it to him.\n\nKeith Andrews (Brentford): It was a massive result for Brentford to beat Sunderland 3-0. At the start of the season, a lot of people were questioning whether Keith was the right man for the job and whether Brentford could stay in the league.\n\nHis inexperience, the squad getting depleted... now they find themselves on the path towards European places. It's frightening. Sunderland have been really good and I expected them to deal with the physicality of Brentford, but Brentford beat them up.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?
