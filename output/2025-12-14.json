    "fullText": "Jalen Brunson's first 40-point game of the year couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nThe All-Star point guard dropped a season-high on Saturday night to lead the Knicks over the Orlando Magic and advance to the NBA Cup Championship on Tuesday night in Las Vegas.\n\nBrunson's scoring outburst came on 16-of-27 shooting (59.3 percent), despite going 2-of-5 from three-point land and only making six free throws. He also added in eight assists, four rebounds, and a steal over 39 minutes in the 132-120 win.\n\nAfter the victory, Brunson spoke with the NBA on Prime crew about his performance and how his game continues to improve, especially on the big stages.\n\n\"I think the way we've been playing, I've been able to get a couple more catch and shoots. I have a lot of confidence in my shot,\" Brunson said. \"I work way too hard not to be confident. Sometimes it's going to go in, and when it's going in I'm just going to keep firing them.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old was then asked by former two-time MVP Steve Nash about his \"touch around the rim\" and how that keeps getting better over the course of his career.\n\n\"It's something I had to learn,\" Brunson said. \"Obviously I'm not the tallest and I'm not jumping over people... My game's unique. I play off balance. I'm on balance, but most people wouldn't be. That's the stuff I work on, just be deceiving. I've done it for a long time and it keeps getting better and better like you said.\"\n\nBrunson's previous season-high in scoring was 37 points, which he's had twice this year (against the Heat on Oct. 26 and vs. the Bucks on Nov. 28). He's now averaging 28.3 points per game over 22 contests and has scored 30-plus points in four consecutive games.\n\nNew York, winners of five straight games, will need Brunson to continue playing with that confidence to keep their streak going on Tuesday night in the NBA Cup Championship against the winner of the Thunder-Spurs semifinal game.\n\n\"I work way too hard not to be confident ... my game is unique.\"\n\nJalen Brunson tells the crew about the parts of his game that keep getting better. pic.twitter.com/D83qzUnMmF\n\n— NBA on Prime (@NBAonPrime) December 14, 2025",

    "fullText": "WWE Saturday Night’s Main Event Results (Dec. 13, 2025)\n\nAJ Styles & Dragon Lee vs. Je’Von Evans & Champion Leon Slater\n\nTonight at WWE’s Saturday Night’s Main Event, the incomparable career of pro wrestling icon John Cena comes to a ceremonious end.\n\nIn the evening’s main event, the future WWE Hall of Famer will take on two-time World Heavyweight champion Gunther in his retirement match. However, the card inside the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, will also include a few other notable matchups.\n\nWWE champion Cody Rhodes will face his NXT counterpart Oba Femi. Women’s division legend Bayley will take on star prospect Sol Ruca, and the current World Tag Team champs, AJ Styles and Dragon Lee, will face NXT’s Je’Von Evans and TNA X-Division title holder Leon Slater.\n\nBelow you can find all the night’s results and the best highlights from each match.\n\nRhodes and Femi delivered an entertaining match, and one of the biggest takeaways was how over the NXT star is that the crowd was split for this one. Unfortunately, after a good start to the show, it ended in disqualification due to interference from Drew McIntyre. That terrible end to the match drops the grade from a B+ to B-.\n\nWinner: Rhodes vs. Femi ends in disqualification after interference from Drew McIntyre\n\nLISTEN TO THOSE OBA CHANTS!!! 🔊#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/4FvMQYpcGu\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nOBA FEMI TAKES CONTROL AGAINST CODY RHODES!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/emPKUGRb49\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nWHAT A SPINEBUSTER 🔥🔥#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/tFXYc9jOfv\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nOBA LAUNCHES INTO CODY WITH AN UPPERCUT OVER THE ANNOUNCE TABLE!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/e2O6MN8mcX\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nDrew McIntyre spoiled the fun, but Oba Femi has no mercy.

Ruca showcased why she is one of the best prospects in the industry and looked like a superstar as she displayed her unique athleticism and moveset. She got the win and deserved it to further build a future WWE champion.\n\nSol Ruca makes her arrival with Zaria!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/Y1FYx3KY1W\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nSASUKE SPECIAL FROM SOL RUCA! 🔥#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/mFLgvVwmp7\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nSOL COUNTERS THE ROSE PLANT!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/WN25CkocNz\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nSOL RUCA DEFEATS BAYLEY!!!!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/8HN06qbjjh\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nJust like the previous match, this one showed the world why Slater and Evans are two of the best prospects in professional wrestling right now. However, Lee and Styles also proved they could hang with the pair of 20-somethings and were able to outduel them to get the victory a Saturday Night’s Main Event.\n\nJE’VON EVANS AND LEON SLATER GET THE ACTION STARTED IMMEDIATELY!!\n\nTHE YOUNG OG AND THE YOUNGEST IN CHARGE 🔥🔥#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/moPcveNhOY\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nAJ Styles moving like the two 21 year olds he's facing is crazy!#SNME pic.twitter.com/03XGWz64bG\n\n— Wrestle Vibe (@Wrestlevibe7) December 14, 2025\n\nAWESOME POWERBOMB FROM DRAGON LEE!#SNME pic.twitter.com/HLks3HZVCk\n\n— Wrestle Vibe (@Wrestlevibe7) December 14, 2025\n\nTHEY’RE GOING CRAZY!!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/Lrr0GR1Xbn\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nLEON SLATER GOES FOR THE STYLES CLASH\n\nAJ STYLES GOES FOR THE STYLES CLASH\n\nAJ SLIPS ON THE PHENOMENAL FORMARM\n\nLEON TRIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE BUT AJ KICKS OUT!#SNME pic.twitter.com/jpNRImgwW0\n\n— Wrestle Vibe (@Wrestlevibe7) December 14, 2025\n\nAJ STYLES CAUGHT LEON SLATER OUT OF THE AIR FOR THE STYLES CLASH!\n\nSTYLES AND DRAGON LEE DEFEAT SLATER AND JE’VON EVANS!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/0ZlcMgC7VI\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nIn his final match, John Cena delivered another memorable match with high drama. After a hard-fought war, like many legends before him, Cena did the honors on his way out. It enraged fans in the arena, but they clearly haven’t been paying attention to pro wrestling for the last half-century if they expected the icon to win on the way out.\n\nJOHN CENA MAKES THE FINAL ENTRANCE OF HIS CAREER!!!\n\nTHE LAST TIME IS NOW!!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/McWG8bOOww\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nLILIAN GARCIA DELIVERS THE FINAL INTRODUCTION OF JOHN CENA!!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/kZSsFceoC6\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nLOUD CHANTS OF “F*CK YOU, GUNTHER!”#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/jeT2CDTr3z\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nCENA BLOCKS A GUNTHER CHOP!!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/mJK6x7WbEq\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nPOSSIBLY THE FINAL FIVE KNUCKLE SHUFFLE EVER!!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/VBDrjpBlQz\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nAA THROUGH THE ANNOUNCE TABLE!!!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/F8qLvIOYMJ\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nCENA HITS THE TOP ROPE LEG DROP!!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/ir2W4QVVPK\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\n“YOU STILL GOT IT” CHANTS FOR CENA!!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/u3dD5Ha1Cf\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nIt's over. \n\nGunther taps out John Cena. pic.twitter.com/0O2lTpl3p1\n\nMichael Cole after John Cena tapped out to Gunther:\n\n“Tonight, professional wrestling destroyed sports entertainment.”#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/kn97EYxrcM\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\n“BULLSH*T!” chants after John Cena lost his final match#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/DcXBKpri81\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nCody Rhodes and CM Punk give their championships to John Cena#SNME pic.twitter.com/PGxC7LArS2\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nHUGE boos as Triple H hugged John Cena\n\nThe crowd is not happy#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/kgrLKqQh17\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nJohn Cena Officially Retires: 6 Dream Matches We Never Got, Including Versus Goldberg\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden\n\nMLB Free Agency Predictions: Projecting Landing Spots for Top 5 MLB Free Agents Right Now",

    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the iconic career of WWE legend John Cena will get a ceremonious end. His match with Gunther will conclude a year-long retirement tour where he took part in many entertaining matchups. However, during the tour and throughout his career, there were several dream matchups that wrestling fans missed out on.\n\nWith his career officially over, we look at six matches wrestling fans never got during John Cena’s incomparable career.\n\nDespite being on the roster together during both of Drew McIntyre’s two stints in WWE, he never faced Cena. He was also a popular pick to get a match with the legend during his 2025 tour. Yet, the stars never aligned, and the future Hall of Famer never got to face the current and best version of the “Scottish Psycho.”\n\nLA Knight nearly got his opportunity to face Cena, but came up just short to Gunther in the “Last Time is Now Tournament” final. It would have made sense for Knight to face Cena and win as a passing of the torch moment. The former United States champion would have also been a good opponent option during Cena’s short heel run. Alas, it never happened.\n\nCena wasn’t a star during Bill Goldberg’s first run in WWE, but he was an icon when he made his surprise return in the late 2010s. A dream match between them at WrestleMania could have been epic as the two powerhouses and wrestling greats went toe-to-toe in a match few would have expected. Yet, the company chose to have the former WCW champion focus on a long feud with Brock Lesnar instead of a matchup with John Cena.\n\nJey Uso eliminated John Cena in this year’s Royal Rumble. There were rumblings about a match between the two after that, but it never happened. A clash between the two would have been a lot of fun since they are two of the most beloved characters in WWE right now. Instead, Uso was busy in the World Heavyweight title picture for much of 2025.\n\nTo many wrestling fans, Japanese icon Kazuchika Okada is seen as NJPW’s version of Cena. That is why the two facing off is a unique dream match some fans hoped to see. However, when Okada chose to sign with AEW in March of last year, it killed any chance of that matchup ever happening.\n\nRic Flair has faced many elite stars from multiple generations. However, John Cena was not one of the. The idea of the long-time leader for most world title reigns facing the man who would eventually beat his record could have been interesting, but they never went toe-to-toe in that short period during the end of Flair’s run as an active competitor in WWE.\n\nShane McMahon, surprisingly, got to face many WWE legends during his part-time run wrestling in his father’s company. Yet, despite getting huge matchups with all-time greats like The Undertaker, Steve Austin, and The Rock, McMahon never got a one-on-one match with Cena. The bout probably would have been a lot of fun, especially the build-up to the unexpected bout.\n\nSaturday Night’s Main Event Results: Highlights From John Cena Retirement Match & Grades\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden\n\nMLB Free Agency Predictions: Projecting Landing Spots for Top 5 MLB Free Agents Right Now",

    "fullText": "The Jacksonville Jaguars have a chance to make history since 2017 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis season has seen a close race in the AFC South, mainly between the Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, and Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFor the Jaguars, they had an eventual season, they also lost their second overall draft pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, Travis Hunter, to a season ending knee injury after only seven games, but beating the Kansas City Chiefs on an improbable scramble by Trevor Lawrence in the fourth quarter, and are currently on a four-game winning streak, with the last two wins coming over division rivals while leading the South.\n\nOn Sunday, the team will look to continue its momentum when it hosts the New York Jets, who are 3-10 and in the running for the first draft pick in the 2026 draft, which will feature the likes of Heisman trophy winner Fernando Mendoza.\n\nWith a win, it will be the first time the team has reached 10 wins in a season since 2017, when they made a run to the AFC conference championship game before losing to the New England Patriots, 24-20, with a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nObviously, those teams are complete opposites, which emphasizes just how long it has been for the Jaguars to have a solid season with playoff aspirations. Trevor Lawrence is hoping to lead the team to their second playoff appearance as the starting quarterback.\n\nBased on how things currently stand, the last three games for the Jaguars after Sunday are winnable, with one more game against the Tennessee Titans, who have struggled in Cam Ward's first year, and the Colts, who have recently turned to a 44-year-old Philip Rivers to take over as their starting quarterback.\n\nThe only game they may not be favored in is the Week 16 showdown versus Bo Nix and the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium.",

    "fullText": "As Fernando Mendoza put the finishing touches on a Heisman Trophy-winning season, he signed an NIL deal with adidas. Shortly after he won college football’s highest honor, the brand paid tribute.\n\nAdidas released a video honoring Mendoza after he won the Heisman on Saturday night. The brand paid homage to his viral quote following the Big Ten Championship when the IU quarterback told FOX Sports’ Jenny Taft, “The Hoosiers are flippin’ champs.”\n\nThroughout the year, Mendoza not only became one of the biggest stars on the field, but one of the top names in the sport. He has a $2.6 million On3 NIL Valuation as Indiana soon prepares for the College Football Playoff as the No. 1 seed.\n\n@IndianaFootballpic.twitter.com/xafU0DhsLC\n\n— adidas US Football (@adidasFballUS) December 14, 2025\n\nJust before IU took on Ohio State in Indianapolis, Mendoza announced his high-profile NIL deal with adidas. He is the latest college football star to partner with the Three Stripes, joining Ohio State receiver Jeremiah Smith and Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola, among others.\n\n“Excited to share that I’ve accepted an opportunity to join adidas!” Mendoza wrote in a LinkedIn post. “I’m very grateful for everyone who has supported me along the way and excited to bring my passion for sport, leadership, and work ethic to the Three Stripes. Let’s get to work.”\n\nMendoza led the nation with 33 touchdown passes this year while completing 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards, to just six interceptions. Additionally, his $2.6 million On3 NIL Valuation ranks No. 5 in college football and No. 7 in the On3 NIL 100, the first of its kind and defacto NIL ranking of the top 100 high school and college athletes ranked by their On3 NIL Valuation.\n\nFernando Mendoza beat out Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia for the award, garnering 643 first-place votes and 2,362 points. Pavia got 189 first-place votes and 1,435 points. It’s the latest chapter in a special season for the former Cal star, who helped lead Indiana to its first outright Big Ten title since 1945.\n\nAfter the announcement, Mendoza delivered a passionate speech. As he wrapped, he had a message for young athletes who think they’re not getting enough attention or are ranked high enough.\n\n“The truth is, you don’t need the most stars, hype or rankings,” Mendoza said. “You just need discipline, heart and people who believe in you. And you need to believe in your own abilities. I hope this moment shows you that chasing your dreams are worth it, no matter how big or impossible they seem.”",

Miller scored his second goal of the game on a power play at 2:56 of overtime as the New York Rangers rallied to beat the Montreal Canadiens 5-4 on Saturday night.\n\nWill Cuylle, Noah Laba and Artemi Panarin also scored to help the Rangers snap a three-game skid (0-1-2).

    "title": "Online Piracy Can Boost Box Office Revenue, Study Suggests",
    "description": "A new academic study counterintuitively concludes that online piracy can boost box office revenue for some films.",
    "fullText": "The general belief in Hollywood is that piracy causes billions of dollars in lost revenue and is predominantly harmful.\n\nHowever, if research has shown anything over the years, it’s that piracy can have positive effects too.\n\nIndeed, a new study from researchers at Monash University and San Jose State University, published in Research Policy, provides fresh evidence for this. It suggests that, under the right conditions, piracy can boost box office ticket sales.\n\nThe paper, titled “Avengers assemble! When digital piracy increases box office demand”, uses a dataset that matches U.S. box office revenue with the timing of high-quality piracy releases between 2004 and 2020.\n\nThe researchers find that the impact of piracy on movie theater attendance differs for various types of films.\n\nFor this study, the researchers make a distinction between “Spectacle” films, which include stunning visual blockbusters or action flicks, and “Story” films, such as dramas and comedies.\n\nSpectacle films are broadly defined as movies where the in-theater experience significantly adds to the experience. For example, through stunning visuals and immersive surround sound. Story films, however, rely more on the dialogue, screenwriting, and acting—qualities that can also be enjoyed on a laptop or TV.\n\nAfter categorizing the films, the researchers analyzed a dataset of U.S. box office figures, matching these with upload data from The Pirate Bay to track when high-quality pirated copies appeared online. Since the timing of these pirate releases is quasi-random, the research effectively infers a causal effect of piracy on box office revenues, depending on the movie type.\n\nThese narrowed-down results are striking. While piracy seemingly hurt dramas and comedies, it appears to act as a promotional tool for ‘spectacle’ films, driving audiences to the movie theater rather than keeping them at home.\n\nThis isn’t a small effect either. The study estimates that high-quality pirate releases increase weekly box-office revenue by approximately 24.4% for spectacle films. For story films, the effect flips, as pirate releases lead to a 26.6% decline in weekly box-office revenue.\n\n“Our research shows that digital piracy does not harm all movies equally,” says the paper’s co-author Wendy Bradley, who works as an assistant professor of management at San José State University. She notes that, for spectacle-oriented films, piracy can act as a nudge to go to the box office.\n\n“Watching a pirated copy may convince people that the real value of the film comes from the shared cinematic experience, not just the story, and encourage them to watch in theaters. In contrast, story-driven movies are more vulnerable because piracy is a better substitute for in-theater visits,” Bradley says.\n\nThis is corroborated by the paper’s lead author, Klaus Ackermann, who notes that some movies are simply better suited for today’s movie theater experience.\n\n“A romantic comedy or ‘chick flick’ like 27 Dresses offers a limited in-cinema experience by itself, while Marvel movies are a different story,” Ackermann notes, adding that movie theaters have already started to respond to this by offering more ‘experiences’ and special events.\n\nImportantly, the positive effects on box office revenues are unique to high-quality piracy leaks, which include “BluRay” or “HD” rips. The researchers found that low-quality versions, including CAM rips, consistently hurt box office revenues across all genres.\n\nThe impact is substantial here as well, as low-quality pirate releases were typically linked to a 24% drop in box office revenues.\n\nWhile these results may seem counterintuitive, the authors have statistically ruled out several alternative explanations. That said, the study relies on a quasi-random research design that tried to simulate causality. Therefore, follow-up research is needed to replicate and potentially expand these spectacular results.\n\nThe paper suggests that future research may also want to consider the effect of piracy on legal streaming subscription services like Netflix, or other forms of entertainment, such as video games.\n\nFor the movie industry, the paper once again suggests that a focus on adding value is key to competing with piracy. This is in line with research we covered last month, which showed that investments in the movie theater experience can help deter piracy.\n\nBradley stresses that their research indicates that piracy does not have to be met with more enforcement all the time. Instead, studios may want to focus on offering a better theater experience. Then, high quality pirate releases serve as promotion.\n\n“My takeaway for studios is that digital piracy isn’t going away,” Bradley says.\n\n“Rather than fighting it predominantly through legal means, whether that be lobbying for anti-piracy policy or expensive IP litigation, studios can strategically design, price, and release movies so that theatrical value becomes harder to replicate at home,” she concludes.\n\nAckermann, K., Bradley, W.

Student artwork and a Blackfeet Nation flag bedecked the walls alongside a mural of a buffalo skull and the school’s name in dripping red letters. The kids didn’t sit in rows or take out homework; nobody checked whether they were on time. They shuffled around in grubby Converse, joking with each other at full volume. Some picked up instruments and started jamming with their teacher, Robert Hall (Piikunii), who was already messing around on the drum kit. It got loud, fast.</p>\n<p>“I would describe Browning as metal,” Hall told me, seated at the drums in a luau shirt and bushy black ponytail, his ferocious brown eyes the size of jawbreakers. “We don’t turn away from the darkness,” he said. “We don’t hide our own ugliness, the way that people in big cities could hide.” The town is rough, even by rez standards. “There’s buildings that have been standing just in a void. No humans, no life running through these buildings for years,” Hall explained. “But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”</p>\n<p>Another teacher, Charlie Speicher, warmed up the mic. “Who likes chaotic mathcore?” he tried, referring to a rhythmically unpredictable subgenre of hardcore punk that he describes as “bonkers” and “all over the place.” Two hands went up. One was mine. “That makes three of us,” said Speicher as he pulled up a YouTube video.</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338255) -->\n<p>The students were finishing the inaugural year of Buffalo Hide Academy’s semester-long, two-hour heavy music symposium dedicated to the study of metal and hardcore. Speicher, who’s non-Native, is a clinical counselor and also Buffalo Hide Academy’s director. The symposium was his brainchild. He and other teachers hand-picked students who looked like they might be isolated, or might be into darker, more aggressive art and music — kids who might be potential metalheads. More than fifty students initially enrolled. By the end of the first semester, kids were sneaking out of other classes to join.</p>\n<p>Speicher teaches in his “battle vest,” a staple of metal fashion that’s usually denim hand-studded with metal pyramids or spikes, and stitched with patches showing band logos in barbed, rootlike scripts impossible for the uninitiated to decipher. In addition to providing a feeling of physical protection, battle vests are threshold guardians that intimidate normies while signalling to dedicated fans who recognize the glyphs. If you know, you know — and you’re family. If not, fuck off. But Speicher is here to welcome kids into the fold, where a community of music fans understands their suffering. Or, as he put it later, “to create more safety and protection specifically from suicidal distress,” which he said has impacted every family in Browning.</p>\n<p>Some in Browning think he’s doing the devil’s work, but Speicher is as warm and approachable as a cool youth pastor, speaking gently and smiling easily through a handsome swath of stubble. His vest is emblazoned with the gaunt face from Converge’s 2001 album <em>Jane Doe.</em> He showed the kids the music video to “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY-JkeXK4dU\">Farewell, Mona Lisa</a>” by mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan. It sometimes sounds like Dick Van Dyke’s fancy footwork flawlessly executing a trip and stumble. “Goes hard, huh? What’d you see? What’d you hear?”</p>\n<p>It’s precise and complicated, students said. The guitars and drums are in conversation, mirroring each other. The drumming starts like black metal blast beats but switches into a groove. Rough vocals alternate with intelligible singing. Guitars are in standard tuning, not drop-tuning like most metal. The fashion is different from metal too – less theatrical. One student noted the singer’s contorted body language: “He’s feeling his emotions while he’s letting the art out of him.”</p>\n<p>“Mmm, beautiful,” Speicher said. Later, students looked at landscape photos and guessed which heavy genre or subgenre they represented: a frozen forest for black metal; a crumbling alley for doom; an urban protest for hardcore; an alligator swamp for death metal. They discussed “geographic determinism,” the theory that music is shaped partly by its place of origin.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But Speicher wasn’t just there to nerd out. He shifted seamlessly into an overview of heavy music’s therapeutic benefits: catharsis, community and coping skills. “Heavy music teaches us things such as we’re not alone; when life is dark, we do something about it. We’re not just a prisoner to that darkness. But also that our risk fluctuates, that our misery isn’t gonna last forever. There are ways through it.” Students doodled in notebooks, idly plucked at an unplugged bass guitar, or held hands under the table.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A history lesson from another teacher on the ’80s and ’90s Scandinavian origins of black metal — including its problematic elements, like murder and Nazism among some bands — served as a caution to consume media critically. While hardcore is overtly political and tends hard left, the morality of metal is murkier, oriented primarily around pushing extremes and attacking social norms. Results can be chaotic. This segued into a high-level, student-led conversation about whether and when to separate art from artist. In another lesson, Speicher said, they’d studied the Vietnam War through the lens of Black Sabbath, whose 1970 staple “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ssFjyDIyQ0\">War Pigs</a>” critiqued American involvement.</p>\n<p>“Your homework tonight, and I’ll remind you of this later, go listen to the song ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiKjcrniJKY\">43% Burnt</a>.’” Speicher told students to pay special attention to an influential breakdown at the end. They broke off to paint each other’s faces in “corpse paint,” and take album cover-style photos with animal skulls and hides. Emily Edwards (Piikunii), an almost-15-year-old, schooled me on Swedish rock. “You don’t know Ghost?” she said. Inspired by the class, Edwards and some friends had started their own band, Crimson Harmony. Edwards was one of many students who signed up for a paid internship at an upcoming metal festival called Fire in the Mountains coming to Blackfeet Nation later that summer. Festival internships were part of why teachers started the symposium.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nicholas Rink (Piikunii), who teaches Blackfeet studies and language, pulled me aside, brimming with excitement. He was painting the skull of a buffalo the students helped process. Across its brow he’d painted overlapping bear paws, mother and cub, in flame colors. He dotted them with pinprick white stars — Ursa Major and Minor, which he said both Piikunii and European traditions recognize as bears. The skull was a gift for Norwegian festival headliners Wardruna, whose latest album, <em>Birna</em>, was named in honor of the bear. Rink had aligned the painted stars to match the position the real stars would take when Wardruna performed beneath them in Blackfeet Nation.</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338259) -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\">\n<!-- RTT removed image (338258) -->\n<!-- RTT removed image (338257) --><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">(<em>Clockwise from top</em>) Students apply corpse paint at Buffalo Hide Academy in May.

Speicher said it hit the entire community “like a sledgehammer.” He called up a fourth grade teacher in Rathdrum, Idaho, named Steve Von Till, whom metalheads might recognize as a doomy poet-troubadour and the former Neurosis guitarist. Speicher, Hall, Rink, Von Till and a few others banded together to help their students stay alive, as if building a protective fire to shelter them in the darkness. They called themselves the <a href=\"http://firekeeperalliance.org/\">Firekeeper Alliance</a>.</p>\n<p>A few years earlier, the crunchy-pagan festival Fire in the Mountains was priced out of gentrifying Jackson, Wyoming. Speicher spoke to its owners about bringing the festival to the rez. He planned to build internships into his class to connect kids with career pathways in an industry of like-minded people. It sounded perfect. But first they needed buy-in from tribal council.</p>\n<p>The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council has long supported youth through athletics, especially running and basketball. Dipping into the arts, specifically music — to say nothing of metal — would be new territory. But Councilman Everett Armstrong told me that because it was for the kids, they considered it. “Let’s try to go a different route to give our youth something that they can open our minds to, open our hearts to, find themselves,” he said.</p>\n<p>It could help the nation economically, too, Armstrong said. The reservation lies along the imaginary line splitting Piikunii homelands into the colonial annex called Glacier National Park. The park is an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/news/tourism-to-glacier-national-park-contributes-548m-to-local-economy.htm\">over-half-billion-dollar industry</a>. But many Piikunii people, Armstrong said, live in poverty. It’s one of the factors contributing to the widespread suicidal distress that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html\">disproportionately harms Native communities</a>. When I told folks I was going to Blackfeet Nation, most didn’t know where that was, until I mentioned Glacier. The monied Glacier Park Lodge had a gift shop peddling Glacier mementos — but, despite being on the reservation, offered nothing I could take home that says “Blackfeet Nation.” “We need to try to tap into that and try to get some revenue back into the Blackfeet Reservation,” Armstrong said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the festival to work, they needed bands big enough to draw fans to the rez. So in August 2024, the Firekeepers flew to Boulder, Colorado, to court pagan folk band Wardruna, whose world tour was starting at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Speicher and the gang wanted to meet in person and convince them to play Blackfeet Nation. It’s for the children, they would say. Norwegian and Piikunii cultures share traditions of animism. The Firekeepers brought sweet pine ties, used for smudging, as gifts, and met Wardruna at the C.U. Boulder library. They didn’t know the band was already sold on the idea. Singer Einar Selvik had spoken to Speicher on the phone, and they were ready to say yes.</p>\n<p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert,” Selvik told me, “all the pieces just fit so well together.” It was a major get for the festival. Rink said they stayed up all night talking about it. Their vision and the Nordic stars had aligned.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<!-- RTT removed image (338261) -->\n<!-- RTT removed image (338262) --><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">&nbsp;Steve Von Till <em>(left</em>) and Wardruna lead singer Einar Selvik <em>(right</em>) during the festival.&nbsp;<strong>Russel Albert Daniels/High Country News</strong></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><strong>Dance Intertribal</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>LATE JULY: AMTRAK UNLOADED A GAGGLE OF BLACK DENIM</strong> and bandanna-clad metalheads onto the small, sunny platform at East Glacier Park, Montana, a tiny seasonal town 15 minutes outside Browning. Two days earlier, Ozzy Osbourne, the grandfather of metal and lead singer of Black Sabbath, had died.</p>\n<p>Because it was the festival’s first time on a reservation, nobody knew what to expect. Festivals, after all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/27/fyre-festival-2-mexico\">can go very badly</a>, and no one wanted to remember this as “Fyre” in the Mountains. But good omens greeted us. Our Lord and Savior Ozzy must have parted the week’s rainy spell for a few days of perfect festival weather: high 70s, partly cloudy, cool after sunset.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Firekeeper Alliance distributed tickets to the local community, and invited Blackfoot attendees from Canada. Others road tripped in, or flew into Kalispell, around 2,400 fans — a third of them Natives, Speicher and Rink estimated — converging from across the continent for three days and 23 bands.</p>\n<p>On the festival grounds, the party opened not with a land acknowledgement but a welcome from the land’s actual Indigenous people. In proper Native fashion, they held a grand entry, and true to form, it started late. “We’re runnin’ on Indian time!”&nbsp; shouted Hall through a megaphone, war-whooping and half-dangling from the back of a motorcycle that Speicher peeled across the rugged ground.</p>\n<p>As the crew finished setting up a stage in the distance, hundreds of metalheads sat watching in a circle while Piikunii locals in regalia danced fancy, traditional, chicken, jingle and grass. Young Grey Horse hammered the drum and Hall let his rowdy demeanor emcee, throwing out Charlie Hill jokes to keep the mood light. For many, it was a transformative moment. Some fans had never been to a powwow and were encountering Indigenous culture for the first time.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hall called for an intertribal — an all-inclusive dance. The metalheads hesitated, but after a few courageous outliers broke onto the grass, others followed, bouncing a circle in their battle vests and black jeans, like a respectful, slow-motion mosh pit, as they awkwardly tried to two-step like the pros. A showboating school-aged fancy dancer twirled past them in her shawl, rapid-fire footwork leaving them in the dust. But the dance was a welcome, not a competition. Hearts were opening. People cheered, Natives and non-Natives together.</p>\n<p>For Selvik, the powwow was a powerful way “to set the tone, to open the circle.” This festival required some vulnerability of attendees, some deference. We were guests on Piikunii lands. There would be no alcohol — a marked adjustment for metal culture. It would be, as Hall declared, “a cultural exchange between the Piikunii and metalheads.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><strong>Fringe Culture</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>“ON MY RESERVATION, PEOPLE ONLY LISTEN TO TWO THINGS:</strong> rap or hip-hop,” joked Logan Mason (Colville), who traveled from Spokane and volunteered with the camping crew in exchange for festival admission. Mason lost his brother and nephew to suicide, and metal helped him work through depression in his late teens and early 20s. “Growing up, I did not know anybody else that listened to black metal or death metal.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On other reservations, it’s different. The Navajo Nation, for example, has a genre-defining “<a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/photos-heavy-metal-music-in-the-navajo-nation-award/\">rez metal</a>” scene. Some folks joke that you’re either a hip-hop Native or a metal Native. If anything, Natives seem over-represented in the metal community. “A lot of it is land-based,” said Meg Skyum (Oji-Cree), who’d come to the festival from Ontario to see the Native black metal outfit Blackbraid and get a sneak preview of their third album. Atmospheric black metal in particular is “about the fucking trees and shit,” which Natives appreciate. Plus, Natives and metalheads, Skyum added, both live in the margins of ordinary society. “We’re fringe, they’re fringe.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“The metal tribe itself seems to attract a lot of people that go through different types of struggle,” said Tomas Falomir (Ojibwe, Hopi and Zuni Pueblo descent) from Parker, Colorado, noting that the music is healing, the community welcoming. “Any type of person could be included.”</p>\n<p>There’s also something about the sound, Falomir added. “It almost goes with the loudness, and even down to the beat of it.” Other fans agreed. The thundering drums and powerful vocals resemble a modernized version of Native music, one said. Pomona-based Indigenous death/doom project Tzompantli would later exemplify this, shaking the festival grounds with stomping downtempos from a battalion of traditional and contemporary drums. And European bands like Wardruna, fans noted, are really, <em>really</em> into their cultures, especially pre-Christian traditions, just like Natives.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma,” said Damien Jones Jr. (Diné), who traveled with family from Lukachukai in Navajo Nation, and brought one of the festival’s most-photographed battle vests, decked out with turquoise geometrics and a “Frybread Power” backpatch<em>.</em> Jones plays saxophone — classical and jazz. “That’s what I do as well, throw all my feelings and emotions into music.”</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338288) -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><strong>Dark Horse, Ride</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>“WELCOME TO THE BACKBONE OF THE WORLD,” </strong>read the sign at Red Eagle Campground, where the Rockies arched like the knobby vertebrae of a sleeping Elder God half-buried in sediment. Across glassy Two Medicine Lake an amphitheater of pines presided like a chorus between the water line and a low timberline. On the near bank, a footpath wound along the edge of the lake, opening to beach access here and there with pop-up canopies and scatterings of hay-bale seats for workshops and panels on Indigenous sovereignty, ethnobotany, the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous people, and the therapeutic effects of heavy music.</p>\n<p>A cluster of interconnected meadows transformed into parking lots, a village of glamping yurts, a small bazaar of vendor tents, and the “stage bowl”: a shallow glen with two stages set up between tipis serving as green rooms. Curtains of savory smoke stoked saliva as Montana “off-grid catering” team <a href=\"https://www.regionsauvage.com/\">Region Sauvage</a> barbecued ducks and student-processed buffalo. High school interns decorated the stages with skulls, antlers, driftwood, witchy-Indigenous pieces of the forest. Edwards worked the merch tent, hawking Firekeeper Alliance shirts that showed a malevolent spirit of suicide haunting a tipi where Native kids sheltered around a fire. Proceeds supported suicide prevention. Shirts sold out the first day. Parking attendants and security all seemed suspiciously chill. It was intentional, they explained. Natives are used to being followed and scrutinized. Nobody wanted that atmosphere here.</p>\n<p>First on stage was Sage Bond (Diné and Nde), an up-and-coming acoustic metal singer-songwriter from Tonalea in Navajo Nation, who’d previously toured in support of suicide prevention efforts on her reservation. Bond matched the mountain sunshine with a low snarl a la Eddie Vedder, before breaking into a roar the size of 10 mountain lions — what she called “the Cookie Monster vocals.” Bond expected a sparse crowd drifting in and out, but her performance captivated hundreds. It was a big moment — her first time playing a festival that size, which she jokingly called a “black metal Coachella” (though the only feather headdresses were on tribal council members). “How the heck did they even find me?”</p>\n<p>Turns out Bond was recommended by Chicago black metal artists Pan-Amerikan Native Front. During their set, they invited students onstage to headbang alongside the singer, Kurator of War, in black-and-white face paint and crossed bullet sashes. Other students held up a Blackfeet Nation flag&nbsp; and tossed their long hair next to barrel-chested guitarist Necroboar (Purépecha), who looked mean as hell in spiked leather cuffs, but later, backstage, was beaming. “A lot of people are thanking us for being here with the kids,” Necroboar said, “but it’s like you don’t understand what this means to us to be here and to see them.” He told me he and his bandmates saw themselves in the teenagers. Misty-eyed fans agreed, knowing they would remember this moment forever. The band had rehearsed their set that morning at Buffalo Hide Academy with the kids. They’d always wanted to play a rez. Being here was a dream come true. “I’m still shaking from it,” Necroboar said.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<!-- RTT removed image (338264) -->\n<!-- RTT removed image (338263) --><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">&nbsp;Sage Bond <em>(left</em>) and Liłith singer and guitarist Heather Jordan <em>(right</em>) perform during the festival. <strong>Russel Albert Daniels/High Country News</strong></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Musicians didn’t quarantine themselves. Many hung out with fans — riding horses, paddleboarding, doing yoga by the lake, attending workshops and panel discussions, or headbanging in the crowds. By the food stands selling frybread with huckleberry butter, metalheads set up a little table as an altar to Ozzy. It gathered river rocks, feathers, cigarettes, and trinkets. “Long Live the Prince of Darkness,” read a sign at the feet of a grinning Ozzy bobblehead and some candles.</p>\n<p>Twenty-four weeks pregnant, Heather Jordan (Diné) delivered a scorching set in the sunshine with her masked drummer pummeling the kit behind her. Jordan is the singer and guitarist for Navajo Nation blackened doomgaze duo Liłith. She’d wanted to play Fire in the Mountains because favorites like Wolves in the Throne Room preceded her. And it helped that this year’s festival focused on “the Native side of things.” Jordan works a day job at a restaurant serving tourists on her own rez, which is also dry. “It’s like the hardest thing for them to understand,” she said. When Fire in the Mountains invited Liłith, their answer was “Hell, yes.”</p>\n<p>The festival’s spirituality attracted Jon Krieger of Blackbraid, a solo recording project that blew up overnight when his first single, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buh0h-8zrP4\">Barefoot Ghost Dance on Blood Soaked Soil</a>,” got traction on YouTube in 2022. “All the black metal that’s the best in the world in my opinion comes from the heart,” Krieger said. Blackbraid was one of around five Native bands playing the festival, though Krieger, who was adopted, doesn’t know his tribal affiliation. Black metal is a spiritual genre, he said, and while it’s dominated by “Scandinavian dudes talking about old Norse religion and culture,” the values align. “Anti-Christianity is something that we share with them.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On stage later, beneath an array of a dozen stag skulls, Krieger was slinking around like a ghostly Indigenous Jim Morrison, windmilling his waist-length hair, blasting life force through a cedar flute and leaning over the crowd to shriek upward-arcing shards — whose strength never flagged during his entire blistering set — as his guitarist crowned his howls with constellations of tremolo picking. In the mosh pit, one fan hoisted a buffalo rib the size of a baseball bat, presumably from the barbecue, like some feral invocation. Blackbraid’s performance may have converted Daniels, the photographer, to solid metal fandom. But after Converge, he stood by me and said, “Now I get it.”</p>\n<p>Converge was another get, one of Speicher’s favorites. Bassist Nate Newton had Zoomed into Speicher’s classroom to chat music with students. So had Ivar Bjørnson from Enslaved — A-listers, donating their time to Browning rez kids.</p>\n<p>Before Converge played, Speicher and the other Firekeepers presented them with a buffalo skull painted with the iconic <em>Jane Doe</em> face. And they gifted the buffalo’s tongue, the most prized part of the animal, to tribal council.</p>\n<p>A mosh pit opened in the center of the crowd as soon as Converge blasted forth, the biggest and most fearsome pit yet. The chaos of bodies in conflict summoned a dust devil from the Earth into the sky. It might not look like it, but there’s a shared ethic at work, what Hall called “consensual fucking violence, man.” If you get a bloody nose, you can be proud. If you fall, fans pick you back up. We aren’t fighting. By bracing and colliding, we’re helping each other. The rush is purifying. The release, stabilizing. Jumping in, you might want to die, but when the pit spits you out, you’ll be beaming like Necroboar — happy to have survived the maelstrom.</p>\n<p>Partway through Converge’s set, skinny, sleeve-tatted frontman Jacob Bannon passed the mic to a Piikunii youth, who seamlessly took over the chorus of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV4x5DsES9w\">Dark Horse</a>.”</p>\n<p><em>We’ll show the demons<br />For what they are<br />Dark!<br />Horse!<br />Ride!<br />Towards the light!</em></p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338626) -->\n<p>He knew every shout and scream by heart, absolutely commanding the stage. The crowd was living for it.</p>\n<p>Musicians understood the assignment and turned it up to 11, new blood and seasoned pros alike. As dusk settled, staff closed the lakeside trails, mindful of everyone’s safety, while Finnish folk metal band Hexvessel sang about people disappearing into the forests. After dark, fans gathered around a bonfire to ward off the chill. Wardruna took the stage and spread their haunting ambience to the woods’ inky edges. Someone dressed like a wizard slipped through the crowds as a human figure with antlers danced silhouetted before a glowing tipi. High above a membrane of diffuse gray, the bear stars slowly turned.</p>\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>A Strange Road to Joy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A FULL MAP OF METAL'S SPRAWLING SUBGENRES</strong> is hard to pin down. But for what it’s worth, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Musical_subgenres_by_genre\">Wikipedia lists 34 subgenres and 16 sub-subgenres</a> of metal, rivalled primarily by much broader genres like pop, rock, and opera, the latter which has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_opera_genres\">120</a> subgenres. <em>Encyclopaedia Metallum</em> lists <a href=\"https://www.metal-archives.com/browse/genre\">16 main subgenres</a>, but sub-subgenres and combinations seem unlimited.</p>\n<p>Like opera, much of metal prioritizes the voice — though as an aesthetic inversion. Similar to Inuit throat singing, vocalizations are guttural and challenging to master. Like wine, metal adheres to a pedigree whose sense experience reflects a place of origin: Cascadian black metal, for instance, is hazy as the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest. And like European classical music, or jazz, metal ranges in style from ambient drone to bombastic spectacle to precise and unpredictable arrangements astonishing to perform.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“We’ve all&nbsp;had periods&nbsp;of hurt. And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But something deeper draws metalheads together, perhaps a willingness to inquire on levels the establishment forbids. What most clearly sets it apart from other genres is that it’s so rooted in anger and sadness — or their common ancestors: terror, lack, isolation and despair. Metal, one fan told me, is “a strange road to joy.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve all had periods of hurt,” Kurator of War said, seated on a folding chair next to Von Till with singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe, Newton and Bjørnson. No makeup, no bullets. Behind them, morning clouds rippled like flags on the glacier-crisp pebble beds of Two Medicine Lake. “And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.” A crowd of metalheads sat cross-legged on the grass, or perched on hay bales in the partial pine shade, listening to the panel. “I think we’re all curious. I think we’re all empathetic. I think we want to get to that other side of connection and knowledge.”</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338628) -->\n<p>Speicher lobbed questions that prompted an intimate conversation about the healing power of heavy music, which at times drew tears — from fans and musicians. Von Till said heavy music is a way of “getting rid of the sickness,” which helps him become more sensitive and vulnerable. He also noted the importance of catharsis. “How many times has that moment of release prevented that one moment in a kid that can’t be retaken?”</p>\n<p>Early in Bjørnson’s life, he realized people had to be athletic or good looking for acceptance in some groups. “With the metal gang, the qualification was being into metal,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It’s not like this kind of stuff attracts normal people. Like we all — you’re weird. You’re all weird,” Newton said to ripples of laughter and cheers. “And it’s beautiful. We could be completely different but we have this one thing that we both understand: why we’re into it.”</p>\n<p>“It’s them that are weird,” Von Till parried. “We’re the normal ones, right?

Then the familiar tick of a tempo rose from the drummer’s high hat cymbals. The crowd started laughing, cheering, singing. It was “War Pigs” — Sabbath. Colorful stage lights fired back up. When the metalheads sang “Oh, Lord, yeah!” the sneer of Ozzy’s voice carried like mist across the many, a phantom formed by hundreds of mouths in unison. Re-amped guitars picked up the lick to complete the collective homage. Piikunii highschoolers sieged the stage again, drumming powwow style alongside the band.</p>\n<p>Nigh had the crowd caught its breath when lightning flashed like a Catholic schoolteacher flicking the lights. Thunder murmured from the belly of the Rockies beyond a ridgeline that blurred into rolling gray. Another flash. Closer, noted Daniels, the photographer; maybe two second’s delay. Sparse droplets swelled to a downpour. The lightless heavens opened, the Prince of Darkness summoned.</p>\n<p>“This is metal,” a festival staff member in a Day-Glo vest shouted to fans gathered under the merch tent. He wasn’t speaking metaphorically. The tent’s frame could draw lightning. “Shelter in your cars or tents!” he ordered. “Go, now! <em>Now!”</em> Metalheads scrambled for cover, evacuating in slick mud.</p>\n<p>Daniels and I found ourselves with some new friends, ducking into the yurt of one of the musicians, Rebecca Vernon, founder of Salt Lake City doom-sludge band SubRosa, who now performs a solo piano project called The Keening. She invited us in, offered us snacks, made sure we were all safe and hydrated. We laughed together, Natives and non-Natives, prisoners of the darkness, speculating about whether Inter Arma had summoned the spirit of Grandfather Ozzy and he was messing with us from — wherever he was. We worried the next set might be canceled. It was one of the headliners, Old Man’s Child, a fan favorite that helped define the Norwegian black metal sound in the early days. In over 30 years, Old Man’s Child had never played in the United States. But they’d agreed to play Blackfeet Nation.</p>\n<p>“Debuting in a setting like this adds depth to the moment,” singer Galder <a href=\"https://knotfest.com/blogs/from-the-artist/galder-discusses-old-man-s-child-s-homecoming-and-american-debut-at-fire-in-the-mountains\">told the website <em>Knotfest</em></a> before the festival. “There’s something about the rawness and unpredictability of the natural world that mirrors what I try to capture in Old Man’s Child. The beauty in the darkness, the stillness before the storm, the feeling of something ancient just beneath the surface.” That ancient unpredictability may have just gotten the better of his grand North American debut.</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338269) -->\n<p>A scream rang through the night. Or a shout? It was hard to understand, like metal vocals. I unzipped the door flap. The rain had stopped. The shouts rang clearer a second time: “Show’s back on!” We jammed our feet back into soggy shoes and boots.</p>\n<p>It was fully nighttime when the storm’s misery passed. A string of fans with phone flashlights and headlamps meandered back down the muddy path and over a little footbridge, across a babbling brook to the clearing where the bonfire flared bright and warm between the stages, belching embers upward like some inverted underworld rain. From a distance, the returning metalheads looked like a serpent of stars.</p>\n<p>By firelight we danced with a Piikunii grandmother in a silk bandanna to Dio’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrBUjXaRSUQ\">Rainbow in the Dark</a>,” euphoria setting in from the topsy-turvy snafu and the might of nature, which had banished all traces of late-festival fatigue. Then finally, riding in on the heels of the thunderstorm, Old Man’s Child took the stage. Galder, in corpse paint, dispatched legions of fog wraiths, strobe spectres galloping across a sea of electrified faces. A beautiful hell broke loose, exorcising our collective and personal demons. The festival — the ceremony — was complete.</p>\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>‘Our ancestors held ceremony together’</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ON SOCIAL MEDIA, FANS WERE STUPID WITH ENTHUSIASM </strong>about the weekend: <em>“Pure magic,”</em> <em>“transformational,”</em> <em>“profound,</em>”<em> “life changing.” </em>They posted reports of unexpected tears and healing. One Instagram comment called it the “the most incredible metal festival I’ve been to, and it was my 3rd one this summer.” Others called it the best music festival they’d been to of any genre. Daniels, newly baptized, joined the chorus: “<em>I have joined the cvlt.”</em></p>\n<p>And it wasn’t just the music. The consensus seemed to be that the lack of alcohol actually enhanced the experience. Frank Godla, co-founder of digital publication <em>Metal Injection</em>, said he learned <a href=\"https://metalinjection.net/show-recap/fire-in-the-mountains-2025-rewrote-the-script-of-what-a-heavy-metal-fest-could-should-be\">more about Native people at this festival</a> than he ever had from books or documentaries. Wardruna echoed the many in posting humble thanks to the Blackfeet Nation: “There are so many people out there in the world who deeply sympathize and stand with you and your ancestors in all your struggles. I am one of those people,” Salnik captioned a picture of himself on stage, proudly holding aloft the hand-painted buffalo skull. “It was like our ancestors held ceremony together and their meeting is rippling as we speak.”</p>\n<p>And the learning was two-way: Tribal Chairman Rodney “Minnow” Gervais took the stage to remark on how kind and diverse the metalheads were, how clean they kept the grounds. “Be proud of yourselves,” he said. “What you see here is proof that music transcends religion, color, whatever you want. It brings us all together.”</p>\n<p>“They look scary,” Councilman Armstrong told me about the metalheads, “but they’re some of the nicest people. They’re so welcoming.” People I spoke to in East Glacier agreed. Armstrong said tribal council is now considering branching into music events of other genres, too.</p>\n<p>“It’s heartwarming to have a full circle moment for me,” Mason, the fan from Spokane, said, seeing Native culture come together with the music he loves, in support of a cause close to his heart. “I was like damn, was this festival calling me?” After interning at the merch tent, Edwards said she might pick a different long-term job, but does see herself working in the music industry. And she wants to keep playing in a band when she is older, Crimson Harmony or otherwise.</p>\n<p>As stray metalheads sat around the grand foyer of Glacier Park Lodge, leaning on their backpacks or napping on the sofas, waiting for the evening train, a classical guitarist plucked out a polished-up version of the Led Zeppelin classic “Stairway to Heaven.” On the train back to the West Coast, the metalheads hung out as new friends. In the observation car, they shared weekend highlights, Natives and non-Natives together.</p>\n<p>A week later, I saw Von Till and Vernon again, this time in Portland, the last stop on Von Till’s summer tour before the new school year. We were still thinking about the festival. We tried to pin down what it was about Fire in the Mountains that still had us sobbing intermittently a week out. Von Till nailed it: “It made me dare to hope.”</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338267) -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Can You Imagine</strong></p>\n<p><em>“If there’s a world where we don’t have to worry about suicide, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about bullying, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about violence, about war.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I feel like that world wouldn’t work.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“You could try to picture it, but it never really fully comes into view.”</em></p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338268) -->\n<p><em>“I feel like it needs to be talked about.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I like to daydream about that a lot.”&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>“These are things I think about too much and I don’t have too many spaces to set them out of my mind.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“There’d probably be a lot more people at the reservations, and more family and connection.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Those little subtle moments that we all share, of sitting next to the fireplace, or sharing a new book, making a new friend, all of that would still keep expanding in mysterious ways of goodness.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Everyone just being creative.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“It looks probably a little bit like heaven.”</em> &nbsp;</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n<p>If you’re considering suicide, please call or text <strong>988</strong>, or chat online at <strong><a href=\"http://www.988lifeline.org\">988lifeline.org</a></strong>, for a free, confidential conversation with a trained crisis counselor.

    "fullText": "However, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nHowever, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nApple has lost its appeal of a massive district court ruling in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic Games.\n\nThat April ruling from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple “willingly” failed to comply with a 2021 order allowing mobile app developers to link to payment options outside of Apple’s, and she barred Apple from charging a commission on in-app purchases using external payment links, among other restrictions. In today’s opinion, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.\n\nGonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”\n\nBut the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting any fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.\n\nThe panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”\n\nThe opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”\n\nApple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from Bloomberg and Schaeffer’s Investment Research about the ruling.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.\n\nThat is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.\n\nA slowing economy hits the luxury market\n\nA prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.\n\nMany car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.\n\n“Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.\n\nThat trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.\n\nChinese automakers take a bigger bite\n\nWhile luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.\n\n“Their (Chinese carmakers’) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,” Yuan said. “That’s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.”\n\nThe Chinese brands’ share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.\n\nBYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for “new energy vehicles,” which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.",

While the breathless narrator's commentary was difficult to hear over the wind, the words \"dirty camp\" were clearly audible.\n\nAbandoned tents, discarded climbing gear, and mountains of waste rivaling Everest itself were visible in every direction.\n\nAs National Geographic noted, Everest was first summited in 1953, and in the intervening decades, it has become the \"world's highest garbage dump.\" The outlet added that the broader site, Sagarmatha National Park, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.\n\nUNESCO's Cleaning Everest page, published in 2013, explained that commercially organized expeditions began in the 1980s, and with them, a waste management problem developed.\n\nClimbing Mount Everest is notoriously deadly, with mortality rates ranging between 1% and 6% of all climbers.

    "fullText": "A man is in critical condition after police say an off-duty officer shot him following a road rage confrontation in Orange County.\n\nIt happened Thursday around 3:45 p.m. on Dolsontown Road near McVeigh Road.\n\nCellphone video appears to show what went down after one man pulled a knife and the officer pulled a gun.\n\nOfficials say the confrontation escalated when the driver of a Volkswagen, 31-year-old Wallace Fisher, got out of his car and approached the driver of a Toyota.\n\nPolice say the verbal altercation at the driver's side window turned physical and Fisher allegedly pulled out a knife and took a swing inside the car.\n\nIt is unclear in the video if he is holding the knife as he takes a swing.\n\n\"The boy swing, he punched him and immediately three shots went off,\" Eyewitness Rob Parker said.\n\nThat is when the driver of the Toyota, 33-year-old Anthony Simon, an off-duty Kingston police officer, discharged his firearm and shot Fisher, authorities say.\n\nThe eyewitness who shot the video of the incident said he started rolling when he noticed the two cars swerving and cutting each other off -- a spat that began when one cut the other off while exiting a car wash.\n\n\"The person that got cut off from the cop was tailgating after that, the cop was brake-checking him then the boy tried to pass him and the cop went on the other side of the road and tried to run him off the road,\" Parker said.\n\nFisher was shot twice in the neck and shoulder and was taken to the hospital, where he was said to be critical but stable at Westchester Medical Center.\n\nSo far, no charges have been filed as state police continue to investigate.\n\nPolice are reviewing video and interviewing witnesses.\n\n\"When he got out the car, he could have left. The same way I watched him swerve lane to lane and he get out the way or him the boy from passing. I feel like the whole thing could have been avoided. On both parties, I feel like they were wrong,\" Parker said.\n\nThe Kingston Police Department said the officer, who has been employed by the Kingston Police since 2022, has been placed on administrative duty until the investigation is concluded.\n\n----------\n* More Northern Suburbs news\n* Send us a news tip\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts \n* \nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

    "description": "XRP price prediction turns critical as momentum improves and large holders step in. One level now decides if the reversal narrative holds.",
    "fullText": "XRP price has rebounded from recent lows, rising nearly 4% from yesterday’s bottom and stabilizing after a modest pullback. While the broader trend remains cautious, a new metric suggests downside momentum may be fading.\n\nWith the XRP issuer recently moving closer to regulated-banking status, the focus now shifts to whether large holders continue to step in to confirm a real trend change.\n\nOn the daily chart, the XRP price has flashed a bullish divergence between December 1 and December 12. During this period, price made a lower low, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formed a higher low. RSI measures momentum, and this pattern often appears when selling pressure weakens before a rebound.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nThis setup has already triggered a bounce, but what makes it more compelling is whale behavior. The two largest XRP holder groups have already started responding.\n\nWallets holding more than 1 billion XRP increased their holdings from 25.36 billion on December 9 to 25.42 billion. At the same time, wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP reversed their selling trend, rising from 8.08 billion on December 11 to 8.15 billion at press time.\n\nIn total, these two cohorts added roughly 130 million XRP. At the current price, that equals about $265 million in net accumulation. This confirms that the biggest holders are not just watching the divergence, they are acting on it.\n\nThe timing also matters. Ripple recently moved closer to securing a US banking license, reinforcing its long-term institutional narrative. That regulatory backdrop gives added weight to whale interest at these levels.\n\nFor the bullish divergence to stay valid, the XRP price needs follow-through. The first level that matters is $2.11. A daily close above it would mark a 3.72% move from current levels and confirm that buyers are regaining short-term control. XRP has not held above $2.11 since early December.\n\nIf that level breaks, the next resistance sits at $2.21. Only a sustained move above $2.21 would shift the structure bullish and reopen the path toward $2.58 or higher.\n\nOn the downside, risk remains clearly defined. If the XRP price falls below $1.96 while RSI weakens, the bullish divergence would be invalidated. That scenario would expose $1.88 first, followed by $1.81 if selling accelerates.\n\nRight now, the setup is constructive but unfinished. Momentum indicators show improvement, and whales have already responded once. For this reversal to fully play out, those large holders need to keep adding support, not just react briefly.\n\nRead original story Largest XRP Whales Are Making a Move – Will Price Respond? by Ananda Banerjee at beincrypto.com",

    "description": "\"That ignorant mentality might have someone throw a rock at the truck next time if we don’t stick out and tell these freaks to stop.\"",
    "fullText": "A Cybertruck owner in Worcester, Massachusetts, tried to trade in his golden Tesla Cybertruck after he and his family faced constant harassment, but the company refused, Torque News reported.\n\nKumait Jaroje shared on the Tesla Cybertruck Enthusiast Facebook group that he and his family have been regularly harassed for driving it. People would make offensive hand gestures or yell at them — someone even vandalized his truck by putting a Nazi sticker on it. The Nazis, along with their collaborators, murdered six million Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nJaroje said that the harassment was starting to affect his family. His children have become frightened by the hostilities, and his wife now refuses to drive the truck at all. \"My wife and kids don't deserve this,\" he wrote in his Facebook post.\n\nOut of concern for his family, Jaroje tried to trade in his Cybertruck at Tesla, but the company wouldn't accept it.\n\nInstances of harassment like this can hinder the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, which are crucial in reducing people's reliance on dirty energy sources like oil and gas.\n\nThe EPA noted that burning gas and diesel releases heat-trapping gases. EVs can help cut that pollution because they don't produce tailpipe exhaust. Some drivers still hesitate to switch to EVs because of myths about range anxiety, according to U.S. News and World Report, and concerns about the pollution created by battery production.\n\nEven with the mining needed for EV batteries, a researcher from the University of Oxford revealed that the world extracts far more coal, oil, and gas — about 16.5 billion tons per year, compared with roughly 7.7 million tons of minerals mined for low-carbon technology.\n\nHarassment and stigma add barriers for people trying to make cleaner transportation choices. Greater public understanding of the benefits of EVs and how they reduce reliance on dirty energy can help decrease the stigma for early adopters.\n\nCommenters on Jaroje's post sympathized with him. A few fellow Cybertruck owners suggested ignoring the hostilities, but Jaroje said that doing so might make things worse.\n\n\"It is not a 'be cool' sticker. It is someone accusing me of being a Nazi and telling me to buzz off. The truck got scratched many times, and I fixed it without a problem. That ignorant mentality might have someone throw a rock at the truck next time if we don't stick out and tell these freaks to stop,\" Jaroje wrote in response to a comment.\n\nWould you buy an EV if it only took you five minutes to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The animal \"swooped out of nowhere.\"",
    "fullText": "A forest hike turned unexpectedly dramatic for TikTok user Taylor Chine (@taylorchine), who recently shared a short clip from a trail in the area of Mount Assiniboine and Banff National Park in Canada. The video shows one hiker — along with the cameraperson — attempting to navigate around a territorial grouse blocking the path.\n\nWhat seems to have begun as a normal trek quickly escalated when the bird \"swooped out of nowhere,\" flapped its wings, and chased the hikers off the narrow forest trail, a moment captured in the footage.\n\nThe caption joked that the hikers were \"fully prepared for a grizzly attack, but not this,\" with feeble attempts at politely asking the bird, addressed as \"sir,\" to please allow them to pass.\n\nChine's TikTok shows the hikers cautiously trying to usher the grouse away from the trail while keeping a respectful distance. Instead, the bird makes the first move, lunging toward them with a flurry of wings.\n\nFor hikers in the Canadian Rockies, this kind of encounter isn't unheard of; grouse can become aggressive or defensive when nesting or when startled by sudden movement. In this case, the bird's swift, bold approach forced the hikers to retreat as it held its ground on the path.\n\nWhile the moment is lighthearted in tone, it also underscores how wildlife behavior can catch off-guard even the most prepared hikers — often those expecting larger or more widely discussed animals that pose a greater threat.\n\nUnusual or heightened wildlife interactions such as this might be partially linked to broader environmental pressures. As human populations grow and outdoor recreation expands deeper into wild spaces, animals are increasingly bumped into closer, and sometimes, tense contact with people.\n\nHabitat loss and shifting food availability driven by rising global temperatures can further intensify these overlaps, pushing wildlife to behave more defensively or wander into areas with high human traffic.\n\nProtecting healthy ecosystems doesn't just benefit animals; it helps keep human-wildlife encounters more predictable and less confrontational. When habitats remain intact and species have adequate resources, animals are more likely to stay dispersed and less likely to guard limited territory aggressively.\n\nNational parks across Canada continue to promote responsible hiking practices, including staying on marked trails, giving wildlife plenty of space, and avoiding sudden movements that can startle animals.\n\nVisitors can help by planning routes carefully, learning the behaviors of local species, and supporting conservation efforts that protect large, connected habitats.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Kent State University is dropping 19 undergraduate degree programs with low enrollment to comply with Ohio's Senate Bill 1.\n\nUnder the law, which became effective in June, state colleges are now required to “eliminate any undergraduate degree program it offers if the institution confers an average of fewer than five degrees in the program annually over any three-year period,\" according to Kent State officials.\n\nOn Dec. 11, Kent State University’s Board of Trustees agreed to eliminate the programs, with this fall being the final admission. All currently enrolled students are receiving individualized advising and teach-out plans to ensure timely degree completion.\n\nThe degree programs being dropped effective fall 2026 include:\n\nThe Africana Studies major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Classics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Community Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe Dance and Dance Studies majors within the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.\n\nThe Earth Science majors within both the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe French major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Horticulture major within the Bachelor of Applied Horticulture degree, and the Horticulture Technology major within the Associate of Applied Science degree.\n\nThe Life Science major and the Life Science/Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe Mathematics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Physical Science major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nThe Physics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Radiologic Technology major within the Associate of Technical Study degree.\n\nThe Respiratory Care major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe School Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nKent State will continue to offer related degrees or credentials in several areas under different program headings, according to university officials. For example, the Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics will sunset, but the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics continues to serve students in that field of study.\n\nFor Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Radiologic Technology, the university will maintain other degree options at the associate or bachelor’s degree level.\n\nFor Africana Studies, Classics, Dance, Earth Science, French and Horticulture, the university will continue to offer undergraduate minors or certificates.\n\nKent State also will maintain teacher education bachelor’s degree programs in science and health fields that align with the inactivated programs.\n\nThe board also approved a strategic partnership with NEOMED Clinical Services LLC to take over Kent State's student health services.\n\nThe board authorized the university to enter into a lease and health center services agreement with NEOMED Clinical Services, establishing a collaborative arrangement to provide comprehensive clinical care and preventive services on campus.\n\nNEOMED occupies about 10,500 square feet of space on the lower floor of the DeWeese Health Center to provide expanded clinical services, health education and outreach programs.\n\nThe three-year agreement begins July 1, 2026, with the option for two one-year renewals. NEOMED will provide all staffing for the health center services and will work cooperatively with Kent State’s Division of People, Culture and Belonging to offer retention to qualified employees.\n\nIn addition, the board approved a Student Health Fee effective fall 2026. Full-time undergraduate and graduate students will be assessed $90 per semester, while part-time students will pay $35 per semester.\n\nThe fee excludes College Credit Plus students, students enrolled in fully online programs, dissertation students and students enrolled at the College of Podiatric Medicine.\n\nIn other business, the board approved a six-year comprehensive capital plan for Fiscal Years 2027-32, identifying campus upgrade projects that are the most important to the institution.\n\nThe plan primarily includes projects funded by state capital appropriations and does not list projects solely financed by local funding or philanthropy.\n\nThe Ohio Office of Budget and Management requires that each state college submit a six-year capital plan.\n\nProjects for the first two years of the plan include:\n\nThe third phase of the renovation of White Hall on the Kent Campus will replace antiquated heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment to the remaining floors along with planned classroom and interior building improvements.\n\nTower renovations in University Library on the Kent Campus.\n\nContinued critical deferred maintenance of the aging infrastructure on the Kent Campus.\n\nInformation technology network access enhancements in academic buildings on the Kent Campus.\n\nThe second phase of Purinton Hall classroom renovations on the East Liverpool Campus.\n\nMain Classroom Building HVAC replacement on the Salem Campus.\n\nThe second phase of central chiller plant replacement on the Stark Campus.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Record-Courier: Kent State will eliminate 19 undergrad programs in fall 2026",

    "description": "The presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nDespite the colossal influence of cryptocurrencies on commerce, computing, and even politics, the true identity of the presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains a mystery in 2025. Making things trickier for identity sleuths, this individual (or perhaps the name represents a group?) disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010, that’s exactly 15 years ago.\n\nThough the last public message from the BTC founder was about technical matters, an email that appears to be from Nakamoto's account was sent to a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast, Mike Hearn, in April 2011. It began with an explanation for absence, of sorts, with the first line reading \"I've moved onto other things.\"\n\nBenjamin Wallace, the author of The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto: A Fifteen-year Quest to Unmask the Secret Genius behind Crypto, wrote earlier this year that the BTC creator’s defining moment was the publication of an article on November 1, 2008.\n\nOn that day, the nine-page-long Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was shared on a little-known crypto mailing list. Its significance: it would solve the double-spending problem, which had cryptographers in knots for decades prior.\n\nIn essence, Nakamoto proposed a public ledger using blockchain that would prevent fraudulent copying and thus double-spending of any digital asset. This peer-to-peer system would be developed and refined by the BTC creator over the following months before their disappearance.\n\nWherever they are or however they live today, the most famous name in crypto history may also be one of the wealthiest entities in the world. Recently cited as the 11th-richest ‘person,’ Nakamoto is thought to still hold the majority of the 1.1 million BTC they mined in the currency’s first year.\n\nToday, that crypto fortune would be worth about $99 billion. However, BTC valuations have recently slid to around $90,000 after several months of oscillation around the $110,000 to $120,000 level.\n\nNakamoto’s BTC fortune has remained unspent since 2010, while its valuation has fluctuated wildly. This incredible level of HODLing has led analysts to believe the BTC creator has either passed away or has tragically lost access to the crypto. Others still believe Nakamoto is intentionally maintaining an absolute silence.\n\nBitcoin has no expiration mechanism, with no timeouts, no inactivity penalties, or other kind of reversion to the network. Moreover, there seems to be no quantum or other new-fangled computer cryptography tech that is anywhere near breaking the SHA-256 algorithm. Thus, these coins may indeed remain inaccessible to anyone other than Nakamoto for the next 20–40 years.\n\nHowever, the situation could change if any of the founders’ coins are ever moved or spent. Such an action would cause a stir in itself. Still, it would also expose the public key of that specific coin, creating a more vulnerable attack surface for a sufficiently powerful future quantum computer.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "title": "Unreleased Epstein Photos Show People 'Engaged in Sexual Acts' and Victims in 'Compromising Positions,' Congressman Says",
    "description": "Rep. Suhas Subramanyam confirmed that sex acts are depicted, while Rep. Robert Garcia stated that \"some are very disturbing [images] of women and their conditions\"",
    "fullText": "There are photos of \"people engaged in sexual acts\" among the images the House Oversight Committee collected from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, per Rep. Suhas Subramanyam\n\nRep. Robert Garcia echoed that \"some are very disturbing [images] of women and their conditions\"\n\nHouse Democrats released two batches of photos on Dec. 12, with Garcia promising more will come to light\n\nAs House Democrats continue to release photos collected from late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate, a congressman has confirmed that some of the images depict people engaged in sexual acts.\n\nAfter the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee shared a selection of photos from Epstein's estate — more than 95,000 photos have reportedly been collected, in total — on Friday, Dec. 12, Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam confirmed on CNN’s The Arena with Kasie Hunt that some of the unreleased images depict “a lot of people” engaging in sexual acts.\n\nAsked if the committee has pictures of “people engaged in sexual acts” among the collected images, the Democratic congressman told Hunt that “as part of this release, yes, there are pictures of people engaged in sexual acts.”\n\nThe CNN political correspondent also inquired about whether men other than Epstein are shown engaging in these acts, to which Subramanyam answered: “We’re going through that.” The congressman said that lawmakers are “not really quite sure yet who is who,” but added, “Certainly, there are a lot of people involved, though, in some of these acts.”\n\nThe first batch of 19 images show more than 10 prominent men — including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Steve Bannon and the former Prince Andrew — in a variety of settings through the years. The same day as the initial release, House Democrats released 70 more images, which depict different angles of previously released photos from Epstein’s private island, per CNN.\n\nNone of the photographs released so far depict any sexual misconduct or individuals believed to be minors, according to CNN.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHunt also asked Subramanyam about what “disturbing\" — which has been widely used to discuss the Epstein photos, both released and unreleased — means in this context. \"I mean, we’re talking about sexual acts involving, potentially, minors and certainly victims, too, in very suggestive, compromising positions,” the Virginia Democrat said. “Just to leave it at that.”\n\nThe congressman also offered comments on some of the figures depicted in the newly released images. Asked if the Clinton family was given a warning ahead of the release, Subramanyam said: “We are not looking to shield anyone, Democrat or Republican. We are finding the evidence, and we’re putting it out.”\n\n“The only people we’re really consulting with, when it comes to whether or not it’s appropriate to put something out, is victims,” Subramanyam added. (The House Oversight Committee covered the faces of several women in the newly shared photos for privacy reasons.)\n\n“If the Clintons have information, we want to hear it. We welcome them to come testify before a committee, clear their names,” he said, adding that the same is true for Gates, the former Prince Andrew and any others pictured in the photographs.\n\nAdded Subramanyam: “We want to hear from them all about what they know when it came to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.”\n\nCalifornia Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, also addressed the reportedly “disturbing” photos collected from Epstein's estate in a Friday interview.\n\nAppearing on CNN’s The Source with Kaitlan Collins on Dec. 12, Garcia told the host and White House correspondent that some of the images they received from Jeffrey Epstein's estate are \"quite disturbing.\"\n\nHe also told Collins that there are “many, many photos of women” among them. Specifically, he said, \"some are very disturbing of women and their conditions,” per Garcia, who added that lawmakers hope to release the photos in the “days and weeks” to come.\n\nHouse Democrats have vowed to release additional photographs as they continue to pore through the thousands of files they received.",

    "fullText": "CLEVELAND (WJW) — Cleveland Metroparks is highlighting an exciting wildlife sighting experts say proves conservation efforts are working.\n\nWhat are the most searched Christmas cookies in your states this year?\n\nA fisher, an animal in the same family as weasels, mink, martens and otters, according to U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, was spotted on a wildlife camera in Cuyahoga County earlier this year, a Saturday Instagram post from Cleveland Metroparks stated.\n\nThough dozens of reported sightings have been filed in several Ohio counties, including the first in 2013, this marks the first verified sighting in Cuyahoga County and Cleveland Metroparks, according to Cleveland Metroparks Ecologist Jonathan Cepek.\n\n“The Ohio Division of Wildlife confirmed that this sighting in Cleveland Metroparks is the first record in Cuyahoga County since the species originally disappeared in the 1800s,” the post said.\n\nCleveland Metroparks said the fisher is listed as a “Species of Special Interest” by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. It’s thought that the fisher was extirpated, or rendered extinct, in Ohio by the mid-1800s. Causes for their extirpation were “unregulated harvest and loss of habitat,” according to the post.\n\nJosh Allen, Hailee Steinfeld announce pregnancy\n\n“This is tremendously exciting, as this is yet another extirpated native Ohio mammal species to be documented for the first time in Cleveland Metroparks. The return of fishers and other extirpated species like otters, bobcats and trumpeter swans are a result of conservation efforts and emphasize the importance of our healthy forests, wetlands, waterways and natural areas in Cleveland Metroparks,” the post said.\n\nFishers are typically found in forested areas with large tree canopies, and use tree cavities as dens, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. The mammals prey on squirrels, mice and birds.",

But will progressives warm to the California governor?\n\nRepublicans are getting rattled by a run of special-election losses and weak showings on GOP-friendly turf, according to a new report. Amid the electoral defeats, the White House is planning to push President Donald Trump, 79, onto the campaign trail ahead of next year’s midterms. But after Democrats just grabbed Miami’s mayor’s office and flipped a pro-Trump Georgia House seat, Republicans fear the president’s campaign blitz may not stop a midterm slide, The Hill reports.\n\nThe Swedish Royal Court said that Princess Sofia met the late, disgraced Epstein in \"social settings\"\n\n‘Why did Trump just toss the coin into the air like he was releasing a baby bird?’ said one bemused viewer\n\nA Brown University sophomore shared her harrowing experience of living through two school shootings, including the Parkland, FL, shooting in 2018.\n\nThe president took a weird detour about wives at the ball and it got laughs.\n\nThe Winooski School District began to display the flag Dec. 5 to show solidarity with a student body that includes about 9% people of Somali descent. “We invited our students and community to come together for a little moment of normalcy in a sea of racist rhetoric nationally,” said Winooski School District Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria, himself a Nicaraguan immigrant. The Somali flag was flown alongside the Vermont state flag and beneath the United States flag at a building that includes K-12 classrooms and administrative offices.\n\nDisturbing new information has surfaced in the tragic death of Ryan Easley, a longtime associate of \"Tiger King\" star Joe Exotic.\n\nKent State trustees also approved a new deal with NEOMED to provide campus health services.\n\nWho do the CFN Experts think will win the 2025 Heisman Trophy?

    "description": "I went Christmas tree shopping with my teens and was stunned by a $370 price tag. It sent me back to my childhood and our tiny cheap recycled tree.",
    "fullText": "It's traditional for our family to go Christmas tree shopping together, even though my kids are now 15 and 17 and practically leading their own lives.\n\nThis year was no exception. We found a brief window between my daughter's clock-in time for her part-time job at a gift store and my son's dentist appointment.\n\nIn previous years, we had invariably bought a tree from a Vermonter who set up camp in the parking lot of our local church.\n\nWhen we lived in New York City before our children arrived, my husband and I would buy one from a friendly sidewalk vendor with a truck full of fir trees.\n\nThere was something magical about picking it out, throwing it over your shoulder, and bringing it up to your apartment, despite the pine needles that dropped in the elevator.\n\nStill, as an immigrant from the UK, where people literally drag them home or transport them in the back of their vehicle, I still get a kick from seeing cars on the road with a tree strapped to the roof.\n\nThe guy from Vermont had failed to make the journey to our suburb for some reason this year. We chose to visit a nursery based on a friend's recommendation.\n\nIt was packed, but there were scores of trees remaining tethered to poles.\n\nSince it's my daughter's last Christmas before she heads off to college, we decided to make it extra special by getting a taller tree than usual.\n\nShe got first dibs on choosing, and after browsing the 9-foot and 10-foot sections, settled on the third one she saw.\n\nI strolled off to look at some garlands, only to see my husband frantically waving his arms at me. \"Get back in the car,\" he mouthed, not wanting anyone to hear.\n\nIt turned out the tree that our daughter selected cost $370 — the equivalent of $37 a foot. I gasped in shock. I knew we lived in one of the most expensive counties in New York — if not the US — but the price was off the charts.\n\nThere was no way I was going to pay close to $400 for something that would grace our living room for less than a month. Even the kids acknowledged that it wasn't worth the cash.\n\nThe experience prompted me to reflect on my childhood in northeast England during the 1970s. A distant memory stirred in my mind.\n\nI recalled how, several Decembers in a row, my dad dug up a 4-foot fir— for some reason nicknamed George — which was growing in our front garden.\n\nGeorge was so small and sparse, he could have belonged to Charlie Brown. But he'd replant him in a pot, and my sister, Alison, and I would decorate him with lights, tinsel, and ornaments.\n\nThen, at the beginning of January, Dad would put him back in the ground until the end of that year. I suppose we were a green family, long before it became a thing.\n\nGeorge was unearthed one year too many and then died. It was a sad day. We had always been thrilled to watch George enter and exit the house every Christmas.\n\nAfter the sticker shock over the $370 tree, I considered telling my kids that we would plant another George. But we ended up buying another 10-footer for just over $200 from a roadside stand.\n\nI mentioned our search for a more affordable tree to Ali. We reminisced about George. Two days later, she sent me a black-and-white photo from 1976 over WhatsApp.\n\nShe'd found a picture of 8-year-old me standing in our yard next to George. My mom had kept it at the bottom of a drawer all these years.",

    "description": "I never thought I'd plan my dad's funeral so soon. His death showed me why preparing for the inevitable brings comfort, not fear.",
    "fullText": "Sitting across from the funeral director, I held my husband's hand. I needed to feel something real while my body moved between sadness and shock. I glanced at my mom to steady her and at my husband for support. There was one person noticeably missing from our group: my dad.\n\nThe day before, I wouldn't have guessed I'd be spending my afternoon at a funeral home. I had talked to my dad that night and made plans for our weekly dinner. When I hung up the phone, I had no clue that was the last time I'd speak to him. There was no inner hunch that doom was on the horizon, and nothing that said he wasn't feeling well. So, the next morning, when the ER doctor told my mom, husband, and me that they tried to revive him and failed — I didn't know how to process the information. Dying of a heart attack made no sense. I thought we had plenty of time.\n\nThroughout my life, we had relied on him to answer the hard questions, and we desperately needed him now. It had only been three hours since his unexpected passing, and here we were planning his funeral. I had no idea what he wanted.\n\nI recall sitting at my parents' dinner table with my then-9-year-old son. He drank his milk while my dad gestured to the desk behind him. The white stack of papers (the size of a small novel) stood out against the stack of magazines. \"Do you want to read my will?\" my dad asked with a wink.\n\nNot really what I'd call an uplifting dinnertime read. At 71 years young, he was active and in good shape — a recent retiree ready to travel and spend time with his grandkids. I didn't want to think about his potential decline — my dad was invincible.\n\nHe never caught the colds and stomach flus I brought home from school. He rarely missed work, and I figured I wouldn't have to deal with this anytime soon. My grandparents lived well into their 80s — my great-grandmother until 100. I did the quick math — that was at least another 10 years or more.\n\nI politely declined the read, telling him there'd be plenty of time to cover that another day. \"That's all right,\" he began with a smirk,\" I fell asleep when I tried to proofread it.\" And that was that. There was no talk of caskets or whether he preferred The Beatles or the Rolling Stones to be played at his funeral.\n\nNo reason to discuss his death when he was so full of life. That night, we finished our hamburgers, and his will stayed on the desk, gathering dust, for the next year. And then time ran out.\n\nThis memory ran through my mind as I tried to answer the questions the funeral director asked. It was hard to concentrate with this huge lump in my stomach. Mostly, I wanted to cry and run away. Even hiding under the covers right now sounded like a good option.\n\nI concentrated on the warmth of my husband's hand and answered some basic questions, such as where my dad was born and his age. I failed when asked for his Social Security number. My mom tried to take over, but she was so distressed that her answers were slow and hard to access. I wanted to talk to my dad. I wish I had. This would be so much easier.\n\nLooking at my husband, I immediately thought about my son sitting in a similar seat for us. My shoulders tensed. My tears started again, but this time because I imagined an older version of my kid stumbling through unknown answers with no space to feel his feelings. I did not want this overwhelming ordeal for him. If I could make it easier or eliminate this step completely, I would.\n\nLater that night, when my husband and I had a quiet moment alone, I told him I wanted to write out our death details for our son. He looked surprised and whispered, \"We have plenty of time.\" I'm sure that was meant to reassure me, but it was exactly what I said to my dad not that long ago. My mom heart would do anything to protect our son's space to grieve. I wanted cozy childhood memories to comfort him when one of us couldn't — not images of his mom or dad in a casket.\n\nA few weeks later, as I processed my dad's passing, my husband and I talked about our own. We created a checklist of what we wanted, including which funeral home and cemetery to contact. My husband and I added doodles and love notes to the list and made sure our will was in order, too. Instead of freaking my 9-year-old with more morbid information, we told trusted family members where to find all the papers. Fingers crossed, it will sit in my desk drawer gathering dust for many more years to come.",

    "description": "OpenAI overtook SpaceX as the most valuable private company. SpaceX could soon reclaim the title. It's the latest in the rivalry between Musk and Altman.",
    "fullText": "If Elon Musk and Sam Altman like each other, they hide it well.\n\nIn the latest turn in the rivalry, the two are battling over the top spot on the list of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nWhile the two cofounded OpenAI together back in 2015, the partnership has frayed spectacularly since.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018 and later founded rival startup, xAI. Musk or his company, xAI, has filed lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI held a secondary share sale in October that valued it at $500 billion, taking the lead from Musk's SpaceX by a cool $100 billion.\n\nNot one to cede ground to a rival, Musk is now planning his own secondary share sale at SpaceX, according to an internal letter to employees seen by multiple outlets. It would value the company at a whopping $800 billion. If that happens soon, it means Musk would have only let Altman hold the mantle for a couple of months.\n\nMusk also confirmed on X this week that the company is exploring a blockbuster initial public offering, which might be the only way OpenAI can regain its lead as a private company. OpenAI this year restructured its business, which would allow it to also pursue its own eye-watering IPO in the future.\n\nWhile this valuation battle between the two billionaires is maybe cringeworthy theater for the average earner, it underscores a significant shift: investors are pouring unprecedented money into technologies once viewed as speculative science projects.\n\nSpaceX, which aims to make life multi-planetary and colonize Mars, and OpenAI, which seeks to develop a theoretical AI that can reason like humans, are two of the most visible examples, but they are part of a broader surge in frontier-tech valuations. AI, robotics, and defense tech startups have all notched multibillion-dollar valuations in the past year — bubble be damned.",

    "description": "Companies like Meta are offering huge pay packages for top AI talent. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, however, says he isn't giving in to the pressure.",
    "fullText": "The talent wars continue to rage across Silicon Valley as companies vie for the best and brightest minds in AI. There is, however, one major AI company that says it is not giving in to pressure.\n\nMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said on Bloomberg Podcasts that he doesn't plan to compete with tech giants like Meta by offering top dollar for talent.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's matching those things,\" Suleyman said of the $100 million signing bonuses Meta has been offering engineers, and the $250 million packages it's been using to lure top AI researchers.\n\n\"I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team, and I don't really think that's the right approach,\" he said.\n\nSuleyman said he was \"very selective\" about new hires when he previously worked at DeepMind. At Microsoft, he said he has hired \"incrementally,\" prioritizing candidates who aligned with the team's culture and had the right skills, and let go of those who did not.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the top ranks of AI talent are commanding pay packages in the millions.\n\nIn June, Meta spent $14.3 billion on an investment in Scale AI — a deal widely seen as an acquihire of its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Google also made a similar move, acquiring the leaders of Windsurf, an AI coding platform. in a deal worth $2.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that Meta tried to lure his employees away with $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said OpenAI later offered to match.\n\nEven at smaller startups, someone in an AI leadership role can command between $300,000 and $400,000 in base pay, Shawn Thorne, managing director at executive search firm True Search, previously told Business Insider.\n\nSuleyman said \"rotation\" is part of the industry, given the small pool of talent. He cited Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI, Amar Subramanya, decamping to Apple earlier this month as an example.\n\nMicrosoft recently brought in several new hires from DeepMind and OpenAI, he said.\n\n\"There's certainly no 'no poach' agreements, that would not be legal,\" he added. \"People can go work for whoever they want to work for.\"",

    "description": "A one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work for parenting. Over 20 years, I've learned my kids all respond to different styles.",
    "fullText": "For years, the soundtrack of my household has included some version of: \"But why doesn't she have to do that?\" or \"You never punish him!\" Every time I heard it, I'd get that familiar pang of mother guilt.\n\nHad I gotten lazy? Did I care less about what one did over the other? Was I a terrible parent for being too strict with one and not strict enough with another? Did I, in fact, have a favorite child?\n\nNow, nearly 21 years and three kids into motherhood, I finally understand that while yes, I was slightly less anxious as each kid joined our family, it wasn't so much that my parenting style was changing. It was that each of my kids needed to be parented differently, and I had been doing it all along without even realizing it.\n\nMy oldest made this realization the easiest. He genuinely values my advice and still calls me from college to ask for my thoughts on something before he makes a decision. He shares his fears, anxieties, and illness symptoms with me on the regular. But once we talk it through, he almost always goes off and figures things out for himself. With him, parenting is often about stepping back. He wants a sounding board, not a manager, and knowing he'll take the baton and run reassures me that with him, my job is to guide, not direct.\n\nMy middle child is the opposite. Being her parent activates a very specific reflex in me — the instinct to swoop in and take care of it all. She's the kid I want to protect from anything uncomfortable, the one I have to force myself to let wobble so she can learn to balance. She is smart, capable, and resourceful, but she processes her uncertainty through emotion and anxiety, and when I sense her panic, my impulse is to jump in and fix it. The hardest thing I've had to learn is that helping my daughter means not doing things for her but offering solutions while giving her the tools to manage them for herself.\n\nAnd then there's my youngest, who behaves as if he's been fiercely independent since birth. He likes to wave off my involvement and gets irritated if I so much as offer to set an alarm to wake him for school, ask if he's done his homework, or attempt to do his laundry for him. He doesn't want to be micromanaged, but likes to know that I am always close by, waiting quietly in the wings for those moments when it's all just too much, and he wants me to step in. With him, there's less heavy lifting and more just being there to catch him when he's falling.\n\nFor so long, I assumed parenting was something that should feel uniform, a philosophy you carry from one child to the next, maybe tweaking for age but not for temperament. All the while, I was unintentionally adjusting my parenting for each kid, while beating myself up for treating them differently. At some point, I internalized (or let my kids convince me) that \"fair\" meant \"the same.\" But the older my kids get, the clearer it becomes that what one kid experiences as support, another might experience as pressure. What one sees as freedom, another might interpret as abandonment.\n\nAnd while the soundtrack remains the same: \"She's your favorite!\" \"Why do you let him get away with that?!\" I stopped asking myself whether I was getting too lenient or too strict. I started asking a better question: What does this child need from me right now — not what did their sibling need at this age, not what I think I'm supposed to do, or how their sibling wishes I would handle it, but what actually helps this particular kid thrive. I no longer measure my consistency by how similarly I treat my kids, but by how attuned I am to each of them as individuals.\n\nIn the end, the thing my children have taught me, each in their own way, is that my job isn't to parent them the same way three times. It's to parent three different children in ways that help them become who they're meant to be based on who they are now.",

    "description": "Dick Van Dyke , who celebrated his 100th on Saturday,  hasn't shied away from sharing his advice for a long, healthy life.",
    "fullText": "Dick Van Dyke, the larger-than-life comedian, is now a centenarian.\n\nVan Dyke celebrated his 100th birthday on Saturday, marking a new chapter in his already storied life and career.\n\nHe became a household name in the 1960s while starring on the CBS sitcom, \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which won 15 Emmys and two Golden Globes. Van Dyke's star rose even higher when he headlined \"Mary Poppins\" alongside Julie Andrews in 1964 and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" with Sally Ann Howes in 1968.\n\nIn addition to an extensive filmography, Van Dyke also won a Tony Award in 1961 for his role as Albert Peterson in \"Bye Bye Birdie.\"\n\nAs Van Dyke grew older, he has often shared insights and advice on living a long life. Here are three tips Van Dyke follows.\n\nDuring an appearance on actor Ted Danson's podcast, \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name,\" in January, Van Dyke said he exercises several times a week.\n\n\"I've always exercised,\" Van Dyke said. \"Three days a week, we go to the gym. I think that's why I'm not stove-up like my equals.\"\n\nDanson recalled seeing Van Dyke at the gym and being impressed by his routine.\n\n\"I would go to the same gym you did, and if I got there early enough, I would see you, literally, work out on some weight machine,\" Danson said. \"And then, almost like you were doing circuit training, you would not walk to the next machine, you'd dance. You literally danced to the next machine.\"\n\nDanson said he later asked Van Dyke about his workout routine.\n\n\"You said you would come to the gym and work out for whatever hour, whatever it is, then you would go home. You would swim laps and then get back into bed and take a nap.\"\n\nVan Dyke said these days, he's doing a lot of stretching and yoga.\n\nIn his new book, \"100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life,\" Van Dyke wrote that his short-term memory is \"shot,\" but he still has \"his marbles.\"\n\n\"I used to do the crossword religiously for years (in pen), and now it's 'Jeopardy!' that keeps me sharp, though Arlene always has the answer before I do,\" Van Dyke wrote, referring to his wife, Arlene Silver.\n\nVan Dyke and Silver, 54, tied the knot in 2012. In his book, Van Dyke wrote that his job as an entertainer required him to have a good memory.\n\n\"For my whole career, I had to memorize pages and pages of lines and a ton of songs, backward and forward, so I was able to say or sing them without even thinking,\" he wrote. \"When I sing with The Vantastix, it's often songs from shows and movies I've done, and those are right at the front of my brain.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can still pick up new material easily, too, though it might take three or four more run-throughs than it used to be before the lyrics feel like second nature.\"\n\nVan Dyke also wrote that cutting alcohol out of his diet likely played a part in his good brain health.\n\nIn his book, Van Dyke recalled his former roles, including a series of old men, like Mr. Dawes Sr. in \"Mary Poppins.\"\n\n\"I'm not playing super-old anymore. I am super old. Speaking now from this position of centenarian authenticity, I can look back on my old man roles and say that some stuff I got right,\" he wrote.\n\nVan Dyke wrote that it's \"frustrating to feel diminished in the world, physically and socially,\" in addition to navigating the uncertainty of current global events.\n\nHowever, Van Dyke said keeping a positive outlook on life is key.\n\n\"I've made it to one hundred, in no small part, because I have stubbornly refused to give in to the bad stuff in life: failure and defeats, personal losses, loneliness and bitterness, the physical and emotional pains of aging. Because, as I see it, to do that would be to throw in the towel on life itself.\"\n\nInstead, Van Dyke said, \"for the vast majority of my years, I have been in what I can only describe as a full-on bear hug with the experience of living. Being alive has been doing life — not like a job, but rather like a giant playground.\"",

Jalibert conducted a devastating counter attack, linking up with France team-mates Damian Penaud and Louis Bielle-Biarrey.\n\nScarlets kept in the fight and the forwards showed great patience with Thomas eventually squeezing over.\n\nAnd while they looked to consolidate, Bordeaux managed one more before the break with Jalibert offloading to Tiaan Jacobs who rode the tackle before stretching for the line.\n\nScarlets defended heroically in the second-half as both sides introduced their benches early.\n\nAnd it took almost 20 minutes for Bordeaux to find a breakthrough after Sam Costelow held up an effort from a charging Temo Matiu.\n\nScarlets were reduced to 14 players with Jarrod Taylor's sin-binning and the damage was almost instant with Pablo Uberti one of several players queuing up to score out wide.\n\nStill a man down, Scarlets found their third try of the evening and it was another close-range effort from Anderson who is proving a valuable signing from Crusaders.\n\nBut slim hopes of a comeback took a significant blow as some tired defence saw Xan Mousques power over, with his effort quickly followed by a break away from Bielle-Biarrey, with Joey Carbery's conversion taking Bordeaux's score to half a century.\n\nScarlets desperately chased a try bonus-point in the dying minutes, but the defensive effort had taken its toll.\n\nBordeaux-Begles fly-half Joey Carbery said:\n\n\"Thankfully we got the result, especially after going away to Bulls last week.\n\n\"Training and playing [with players like Jalibert] you get to see how special they are. It's a privilege to be out here.\n\n\"To win in Europe is tough, especially at home we have to win these games, and I'm just thankful we have done that.\"\n\nScarlets head coach Dwayne Peel said:\n\n\"It is obviously disappointing that we didn't get anything out of the game, we were fighting hard for that fourth try at the end.\n\n\"I can't fault the effort of the boys, it was just our inaccuracies that hurt us out there, you can't allow a side of the quality of Bordeaux easy ins and I felt we did that at times.\n\n\"Our forwards carried strongly, I thought Fletcher Anderson at eight was excellent, he has been a really good signing for us.\n\n\"When we were in their 22 we took our tries well, it was just frustrating that the game got away through our inaccuracies.\"\n\nBoth sides return to festive league action before playing their final two Pool 4 games in January.\n\nBordeaux face Northampton Saints on Saturday, 10 January (15:15 GMT) and Scarlets welcome Pau in the day's later kick-off (20:00 GMT).\n\nEight days later Bordeaux are at Bristol Bears (13:00 GMT), while Scarlets travel to Northampton Saints (15:15 GMT).\n\nBordeaux-Begles: Mousques; Penaud, Uberti, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Page-Relo: Poirot (capt), Barlot, Falatea, Palu, Coleman, Jacobs, Vergnes-Taillefer, Matiu.\n\nReplacements: Everitt, Perchaud, B Tameifuna, J Gray, Gardrat, Retiere, Carbery, R Janse van Rensburg.\n\nScarlets: J Davies; Lewis, Roberts, James, Mee; Hawkins, Blacker; Hepburn, Van der Merwe, Thomas, Douglas, Ball, Macleod (capt), Davis, Anderson.\n\nReplacements: Elias, Mathias, H O'Connor, Lousi, J Taylor, A Hughes, Costelow, Page.\n\nReferee: Morne Ferreira (South Africa)\n\nAssistants: Griffin Colby & Christopher Allison (South Africa)\n\nTMO: Marius van der Westhuizen (South Africa).",

    "fullText": "Paul Lim became the oldest player to win a match at the PDC World Championship as the 71-year-old claimed a stunning victory over Jeffrey de Graaf.\n\nBacked by a partisan crowd at the Alexandra Palace, the Singapore veteran claimed a 3-1 success over the Dutch-born Swede.\n\nHe beat a record held by Northern Irishman John MaGowan, who was 67 when he knocked out Chris Mason in the first round of the tournament in December 2008.\n\n\"A moment like this has kept me going for all these years,\" said Lim.\n\n\"The standard of play nowadays is not like how it was before. This tournament is the Super Bowl of darts so I would say this is a good moment.\"\n\nLim will face Luke Humphries in the second round after the 2024 world champion progressed with a 3-1 win over Ted Evetts in his opening match later on Saturday evening.\n\nHumphries had cruised into a 2-0 lead against his fellow Englishman before Evetts pinched a set back.\n\nHowever, 30-year-old Humphries regained his intensity and clinically finished out the contest with an average of 98.58, throwing eight 180s.\n\nLim, who thew the first world championship nine-darter at the BDO event at Lakeside in 1990, beat Humphries when the pair last met at the Ally Pally five years ago.\n\nOn meeting again, Humphries told Sky Sports: \"He's amazing, he's a legend. The crowd are going to be against me so it's going to be a tough game.\"\n\nLim said: \"I hope on a given day it can happen again. I never give up. He is good but he can be beaten.\"\n\nThe crowd roared on Lim, who is 72 next month, when he won the first set against De Graaf before his opponent levelled the match.\n\nLim went ahead again after a scrappy third set as De Graaf wilted while the experienced 'Singapore Slinger' held his nerve in a tense fourth, sealing victory with an average of 86.52.\n\nFive-time world championship semi-finalist Wayne Mardle said Lim was able to \"take his chances\" against De Graaf to secure an \"incredible\" win.\n\n\"If you have the desire, the passion but most of all the ability humans can achieve amazing things - and that was amazing,\" said Mardle on Sky.\n\nDe Graaf was six years old when Lim made his PDC debut 29 years ago.\n\nElsewhere, Wessel Nijman of the Netherlands eased to a 3-0 win over Czech Karel Sedlacek while Germany's Gabriel Clemens beat American Alex Spellman by the same scoreline.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca described the build-up to Saturday's victory over Everton as \"the worst 48 hours\" since he arrived at the club.\n\nThe Italian delivered a cryptic message in his post-match news conference despite the 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge courtesy of goals from Cole Palmer and Malo Gusto.\n\nThe three points, which lifted Chelsea back into the Premier League top four, might have improved the mood after defeat at Atalanta in the Champions League extended Chelsea's winless run to four matches.\n\nHowever, when asked about Gusto's assist and overall performance, Maresca surprisingly revealed his frustration over the previous two days at the club.\n\n\"The way the players want to learn has been fantastic and this is the reason why I praise them - because with so many problems, they are doing very well after a complicated week,\" he said.\n\n\"Since I joined the club, the last 48 hours have been the worst because many people didn't support us.\"\n\nPressed on what he meant, the former Leicester City manager added: \"Worst 48 hours since I joined the club because people didn't support me and the team.\"\n\nWhen asked if he meant people internally at Chelsea, he replied: \"In general. In general,\" before clarifying when asked if it was aimed at fans or the media: \"I love the fans and we are very happy with the fans.\"\n\nMaresca also highlighted Chelsea's injury and suspension issues, pointing out they had been without star attacker Cole Palmer for much of the season, as well as losing key midfielder Moises Caicedo to a three-match ban and striker Liam Delap to two significant injuries.\n\n\"I really praise the players and the squad because we played 16 Premier League games, five of them without Moises Caicedo, 11 of them without Cole Palmer, almost all of them without Liam Delap,\" he said.\n\n\"And this squad, no matter who is playing, they are doing fantastic. Today was five games in 12 days so for sure when you see Cole Palmer there, we said many times that he's our best player but we play almost all season without our best player.\n\n\"We play five games in the Premier League without Moises Caicedo. This is the reason why I'm so happy for the players and it's something that I would like people outside to appreciate because the effort from the players is fantastic.\"\n\nChelsea's victory over Everton consolidated their position in fourth in the Premier League table, with a Carabao Cup quarter-final at Cardiff and a league trip to Newcastle to come next week.",

Glasgow needed something to offer a glimmer of hope and they got it when some slick handling set McKay free up the touchline to run in for the try.\n\nWhether it was some strong words at half-time from head coach Franco Smith, or turning around to play with the wind now at their backs, a flick had switched and suddenly Warriors were putting it up to their illustrious opponents.\n\nThe Glasgow bench was making an impact and one of the substitutes, Brown, blasted over from close range to reduce the arrears to seven points and bring Scotstoun to life.\n\nThe roof nearly came off the place when Tuipulotu finished off an a period of intense pressure on the Toulouse line, and when Adam Hastings banged over the conversion we were all square.\n\nStill Glasgow came. They had Toulouse rocking and they landed another blow, a rolling line-out maul thundering over the try-line with substitute Hiddleston touching down to give Warriors the lead for the first time.\n\nThe great teams often find their way out a hole, but on this particular night, the Toulouse Galacticos had the fight knocked out of them by an inspired Glasgow Warriors side on a beautifully bonkers evening at Scotstoun that will live long in the memory.\n\nGlasgow: McKay; Steyn, McDowall, Tuipulotu, Smith; Hastings, Dobie; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, M Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Horne, Lancaster.\n\nToulouse: Ramos; Capuozzo, Costes, Gourgues, Kinghorn; Ntamack, Dupont; Ainuu, Marchand, Aldegheri, Brennan, Flament, Willis, Banos, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Lacombre, Neti, Merkler, Meafou, Castro Ferreira, Roumat, Graou, Thomas.",

There is nothing for me to talk about after what happened against Leeds.\"\n\nIn his outburst at Elland Road last Saturday - where he claimed to have been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and had no relationship with his Dutch boss - Salah said this game against Brighton could well be his farewell.\n\nHaving been left out of the squad for the midweek Champions League win at Inter Milan, he came off the bench against the Seagulls as a 26th-minute replacement for the injured Joe Gomez.\n\nAnd the expectation now is very much that the 33-year-old will return to Liverpool next month after international duty.\n\nTalks are still planned between both parties while Salah is away but, a week on from his emotional interview at Leeds, he was all smiles in the mixed zone at Anfield as he walked past the media and was asked for a chat.\n\n\"Two weeks in a row?
