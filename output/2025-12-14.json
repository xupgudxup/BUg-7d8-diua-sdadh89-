    "description": "Our Packers vs. Broncos predictions like the Green Bay moneyline on Sunday, December 14.",
    "fullText": "Two of the best teams in football collide at Empower Field at Mile High when the Green Bay Packers visit the Denver Broncos today. Kickoff is at 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS.\n\nMy Packers vs. Broncos predictions and NFL picks call for Green Bay to leave The Centennial State victorious on Sunday, December 14.\n\nPackers vs Broncos Best bet: Packers moneyline (-125)\n\nQuarterback play is the No. 1 reason I’m backing the Green Bay Packers to win on the road against the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High in Week 15.\n\nPackers QB Jordan Love paced the NFL in EPA + CPOE composite while throwing for the second most air yards during a three-game sweep of the NFC North, and Green Bay also ranks higher than Denver in DVOA.\n\nAdd the Pack pacing the league in EPA per play while playing a considerably more difficult schedule than the Broncos, and I’m confident in Green Bay leaving The Centennial State with a win.\n\nDenver has played the fifth easiest schedule per PFF and second-easiest by DVOA, after all.\n\nReturning to the QB comparison, Broncos signal caller Bo Nix ranks 18th in EPA + CPOE composite, and his 6.3 yards per attempt and 63.2 completion percentage are both also below-average marks.\n\nOf course, the Green Bay defense has also allowed the fifth-fewest yards per play and ranks ninth in defensive DVOA, and the Packers generate pressure at a respectable 12th-highest clip despite blitzing at the second-lowest rate.\n\nEven with a pair of solid defenses, I’m expecting both the Packers and Broncos to put points on the board Sunday.\n\nThey’ve both hit the Over in consecutive games, and in addition to the highlighted strength of the Love-led Packers on offense, Nix also has the Broncos ranking above average in offensive DVOA, points per game, and both EPA and yards per play.\n\nGreen Bay wideout Jayden Reed is a big-play threat as a receiver and rusher, and he’s found the end zone 18 times through 36 career games.\n\nAdditionally, while the Broncos have only allowed five touchdowns to opposing wide receivers, three of those scores have come in the past two weeks with Denver dipping to 18th in pass defense DVOA through the two-game stretch after ranking third across the first 12 weeks of the year.\n\nBroncos back RJ Harvey has found the end zone in four of the past six games for seven total touchdowns, and he’s also piled up a healthy 15 carries and five targets in the red zone during the stretch.\n\nJayden Reed Over 0.5 touchdowns\n\nSpread: Green Bay -2.5 (-110) | Denver +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Green Bay -136 | Denver +116\n\nOver/Under: Over 42.5 (-118) | Under 42.5 (-104)\n\nI’m obviously backing the Pack, and I think they’re a more complete team on offense with the defensive gap between the two teams far smaller. Additionally, the Broncos couldn’t pull away from the lowly Washington Commanders and Las Vegas Raiders the past two weeks, while the Packers just swept a tough stretch of three consecutive divisional opponents.\n\nThis spread is where things are tricky because I’m anticipating a close game, and the Broncos have won 10 straight, after all. There’s a strong case for taking the points with Denver, and I particularly think the Broncos are an excellent leg for six-point teasers with the spread moving through multiple key numbers to +8.5.\n\nAs noted, I think this total is just a touch short. Both defenses are excellent, but there are no weather concerns, and the Broncos are no slouches on offense with above-average ranks in in offensive DVOA, points per game, and both EPA and yards per play.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have won four straight road games.

    "description": "Ivan Gabriel Mafla Bolanos won the US Polo Assn. Palm Beaches Marathon eight days after finishing third in a marathon in his native country of Ecuador.",
    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH — Ivan Gabriel Mafla Bolanos recently placed third in the Cruzando La-Isla Marathon in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. Eight days later, he ran - and won - a marathon, this time in South Florida.\n\nTraveling from Ecuador the day before, Bolanos was the firsts finisher in the 2025 U.S. Polo Assn. Palm Beaches Marathon in 2:37:56 on a cool, breezy December morning in downtown West Palm Beach. Bolanos finished ahead of Wellington's Charles Richardson (2:43:16) and Canada's Simon Boudreau (2:43:59).\n\n“It’s something incredible when you win the races,” Bolanos said. “Because when you are second — or third — that’s not a good feeling.”\n\nMeanwhile, Teresita Granados Solis was the first female to cross the finish line in the marathon. The 35-year-old Costa Rica native took home first-place honors in 3:06:55, finishing ahead of Palm Beach Gardens' Eryn Renehan (3:19:28) and Palm Beach's Alina Morrison (3:19.36). The win was Solis' third marathon victory.\n\nVia an interpreter, Solis said she felt very satisfied with the result, and was happy that she was able to finish a race outside of her home country. Solis — an elementary school P.E. teacher — also said she is focusing her attentiontowards the Boston Marathon in April 2026, which she has already qualified for.\n\nThe Half-Marathon saw Tyler Bernier of Singer Island place first (1:18:39) over Daniel Viera (01:20:57) of West Palm Beach in the Men’s competition, and Emily Paradis (1:23:55) of Fort Lauderdale outlast Staci Huelat (01:26:24) of Wellington in the Women’s competition.\n\n“I thought there was a chance,” Bernier said when asked if he felt he could win the Half-Marathon. “I just tried to come and run my race. I was just kind of trying to pick it up every last mile until the end.”\n\nThere were a record 6,100 runners participating in the weekend of races.\n\nBolanos, an Ecuador native, said he has participated in five marathons in 2025. His previous marathon on Dec. 6 saw him trek through the mountainous terrain of the Galápagos Islands, a stark contrast from the flat surfacel he saw in West Palm Beach. Usually, the smoother running surface results in runners posting some of their personal best performances. Oddly enough, this wasn’t the case for Bolanos.\n\n“I believe that this kind of race is more difficult, because it is faster,” Bolanos said. “So you have to always run at a high pace and that is very difficult.”\n\nDespite the different site, Bolanos says he wasn’t focusing on his surroundings, and his only concern was finishing the race.\n\n“When I am running, I can’t see anything,” Bolanos said. “I just focus on the race. I believe that’s the secret to perform better in this kind of race.”\n\nBolanos said he felt some discomfort in his legs early in the marathon, which he attributed to taking part in the Cruzando La-Isla Marathon last weekend. Nonetheless, Bolanos was able to power through and claim victory.\n\n“I feel great, really, really great,” Bolanos said, who added that he trains for two to three hours every day. “I don’t know how I am able to recover so fast.”\n\nBolanos also contributed his healthy lifestyle to giving him the strength necessary to come out on top. “I don’t drink, I have a healthy diet, and I just run, and run everyday,” he added.\n\nIf placing within the top three in two marathons a week apart from each other wasn’t impressive enough, Bolanos is also a full-time university professor in Ecuador. Along with his training, Bolanos spent this past week teaching his classes back home, then traveling 15 hours on Saturday to Miami, before taking a Brightline train to WestPalm Beach to compete in the marathon.\n\nOh, and winning a marathon away from home isn’t stopping Bolanos from being back in the classroom on Monday.\n\n“I believe they are going to be really, really happy, as I am,” Bolanos said when asked how his students will react to his victory\n\n1 Ivan Gabriel Mafla Bolanos Ecuador 02:37:56\n\n2 Charles Richardson Wellington 02:43:16\n\n3 Simon Boudreau Canada 02:43:59\n\n4 Harold Barba Colombia 02:58:38\n\n5 Yomedy Vega Colombia 02:59:15\n\n6 Mitchell Kusick Firestone, CO 03:00:07\n\n7 Samir Sanchez Plantation 03:01:06\n\n9 Seth Miller Portage, MI 03:05:28\n\n10 Brooks Robinson North Andover,MA 03:07:02\n\n11 Alec Estrill Boynton Beach 03:12:04\n\n12 Mark Eidelman Jupiter 03:12:48\n\n13 Edward Hartman Boca Raton 03:13:30\n\n14 Michael Pych Jupiter 03:15:46\n\n15 Romario Mendoza Lake Worth 03:16:43\n\n16 Oliver Schr÷er Duisburg,Germany 03:17:32\n\n17 Neil Savage Atlanta 03:17:48\n\n18 Stratas Anastopoulo Charleston 03:18:03\n\n19 Dylan Valenzuela Brighton, UK 03:18:07\n\n20 David Savoff Jupiter 03:18:20\n\n21 Peter Cassels Bonita Springs 03:18:52\n\n22 Daniel Weiss Wynnewood, PA 03:19:05\n\n23 Michael Hicks Rochester 03:19:53\n\n24 Claudio Cotter Boca Raton 03:20:15\n\n25 Adam Obrien Saint Petersburg 03:21:09\n\n1 Teresita Granados Solis Costa Rica 03:06:55\n\n2 Eryn Renehan P.

    "description": "After finishing second in Heisman Trophy voting, Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia posted a message on social media saying 'F-ALL THE VOTERS'",
    "fullText": "Diego Pavia made history Saturday night, becoming the first finalist for the Heisman Trophy in the history of the Vanderbilt football program.\n\nHe finished just shy of college football’s most storied individual award, coming in second place to Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza, but he didn’t leave New York City without making a statement.\n\nThe Commodores’ star quarterback reposted a picture on Instagram of himself with his offensive line at the Heisman ceremony, along with a caption that read “F-ALL THE VOTERS, BUT…..FAMILY FOR LIFE.”\n\nDiego Pavia’s message on instagram:\n\nF*** all the voters.. but family for life. pic.twitter.com/arGq0naWC3\n\n— Dylan Tovitz (@dtovitz) December 14, 2025\n\nREQUIRED READING: Diego Pavia didn't win Heisman, but this sure wasn't a defeat | Estes\n\nWhat was expected to be a tight race between Mendoza and Pavia was a little more lopsided than previously envisioned. Mendoza finished in first place, with 2,362 points and 643 first-place votes while Pavia was second with 1,435 points and 189 first-place votes.\n\nSo, despite what he posted on social media, maybe at least 189 voters were spared from Pavia’s ire.\n\nIn his second season at Vanderbilt, Pavia threw for 3,192 yards, 27 touchdowns and eight interceptions, along with 826 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Pavia was second among all FBS players in total yards per game, with 334.8, behind only South Florida’s Byrum Brown.\n\nWhile racking up those yards, he led the Commodores to a program-record 10 wins. In two seasons, he helped guide Vanderbilt to a 17-9 mark. The Commodores had a combined record of 12-45 in the four seasons before Pavia transferred in from New Mexico State.\n\nVanderbilt will wrap up its record-setting season against Missouri in the ReliaQuest Bowl on Dec. 31.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Diego Pavia posts 'F-ALL THE VOTERS' on social media after Heisman Trophy runner-up",

The Canadiens were lucky to earn a point on Saturday versus the New York Rangers, while the Oilers easily dispatched the Toronto Maple Leafs, winning 6-3.\n\nAs per usual, Oilers forward Connor McDavid was at the centre of the action, scoring two goals, including one play that would lead to envy from Moses himself.\n\nThe Leafs just creating a highway for McDavid lmao pic.twitter.com/HM3TJxDTRk\n\n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) December 14, 2025\n\nMcDavid has registered 15 points over the course of his last five games (7G, 8A), and while stopping him is out of the question, the Canadiens can mitigate some of the damage he inflicts on a nightly basis.\n\nA big part of that equation will be the play of either Jakub Dobes or Samuel Montembeault, but given that the Canadiens did not hold practice on Sunday morning, we won’t know who Martin St-Louis plans to start until warmups begin. Statistically speaking, it should be Dobes’ start, but there’s always a chance that St-Louis will opt for yet another vote of confidence in Montembeault.\n\nOf course, there’s more to playing solid defence than hoping a goaltender can save the day. The Canadiens will need a much better performance from the defensive group, not to mention the many forwards who were caught cheating on Saturday.\n\nFlying the zone too early, or failing to maintain your defensive coverage is a cardinal sin in the NHL, and the penance usually involves opponents scoring easy goals.\n\nRangers cut the lead to 3-1 after the Habs forget they're on the penalty kill. pic.twitter.com/UM7Ph3K8Pk\n\n— Marc Dumont (@MarcPDumont) December 14, 2025\n\nCole Caufield – Nick Suzuki – Zachary Bolduc\n\nJuraj Slafkovsky – Oliver Kapanen – Ivan Demidov\n\nJoe Veleno – Jake Evans – Brendan Gallagher\n\nAlexandre Texier – Owen Beck – Josh Anderson\n\nMike Matheson – Alexandre Carrier\n\nJakub Dobes / Samuel Montembeault\n\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins – Connor McDavid – Zach Hyman\n\nVasily Podkolzin – Leon Draisaitl – Matthew Savoie\n\nTrent Frederic – Adam Henrique – Mattias Janmark\n\nAndrew Mangiapane – Curtis Lazar – David Tomasek\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens versus the Edmonton Oilerse, Sunday, December 14, 2025, will be aired on Sportsnet West, TSN2, and RDS.

    "fullText": "With RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund dropping points earlier on matchday 14, Bayern Munich knew a win would extend their lead to 11 points. Vincent Kompany surprised Mainz with a makeshift defense as Hiroki Itō, Kim Min-Jae, and Tom Bischof earned starting nods.\n\nApart from the suspended Luis Diaz, Bayern had their strongest lineup in the attack, though. Lennart Karl added himself to that list with his breakthrough season, and he had the game’s first shot with his usual technique.\n\nAt the other end, Lee Jae-sung was denied by the woodwork, although he knew very little about his header. That served as a wakeup call for Bayern with Daniel Batz forced to make three saves in less than five minutes.\n\nThe 34-year-old goalkeeper thwarted Harry Kane, Serge Gnabry, and Michael Olise, but it’s almost impossible to keep the Rekordmeister at bay these days. Karl opened the gates with a tap-in after an excellent play by Gnabry.\n\nThomas Müller, who could be considered as the last world-class attacker to come out of Bayern’s academy before Karl, celebrated the goal from the stands. Bayern did very little for the rest of the half, and they were punished for it before the half-time whistle.\n\nIn only his second Bundesliga appearance, Kacper Potulski beat Manuel Neuer with a strong header from William Bøving’s free-kick. Mainz’s equalizer needed a lengthy VAR check for an offside before Dr. Robin Braun allowed it to stand.\n\nBayern’s first chance of the second-half came at the hour-mark when Karl and Gnabry combined again. The latter failed to score from a close range after Karl’s excellent crossing. Kompany responded with triple changes, including handing Alphonso Davies his first minutes of the Bundesliga campaign.\n\nThe hosts seemed to raise the tempo as Batz denied Gnabry before Potulski’s goalline clearance from Kane’s follow-up effort. However, Mainz took the lead right away with a magnificent header from Lee Jae-sung.\n\nThe South Korean scored a brace when Mainz beat Bayern on matchday 14 last season, and he was at it again to guide home Stefan Bell’s inviting delivery. Kompany took the risk of playing without a recognized center-back by taking off Kim Min-jae and Hiroki Ito.\n\nComing off the bench, Nicolas Jackson tried to score from a difficult angle when Karl was waiting for another simple finish. Bayern did get a lifeline when Potulski fouled Kane inside the box, though. The Englishman kept his perfect record from penalty-kicks by scoring his 80th Bundesliga goal.\n\nHowever, Urs Fischer’s side managed to salvage a point in the first Bundesliga game for the Swiss as Mainz’s coach. Bayern Munich will travel to Heidenheim for their last game of the year, while Mainz play two more games in the space of three days against Samsunspor and St. Pauli.",

You always wanted to have a laugh and were a pleasure to be around.\n\n“I know how much Rute and your family meant to you and I know you will always be looking down on them. Thank you for everything you brought into this world, we will all miss you.\n\n“Rest in peace along with your brother Andre. Love ya mate.

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola claimed Manchester City had made a \"big statement\" in the Premier League title race with their 3-0 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nGuardiola's side struggled to impose themselves for long spells at Selhurst Park but Erling Haaland's header late in the first half finally broke the deadlock.\n\nAfter riding their luck thanks to several missed Palace chances before and after Haaland's opener, City showed a ruthless streak to kill off the Eagles.\n\nPhil Foden drilled home from the edge of the area before Haaland added a late third from the penalty spot.\n\nSecond-placed City have now won four in a row in the league and sit just two points behind leaders Arsenal as the title race heats up.\n\nGuardiola was especially impressed with the way City dug deep to subdue tenacious Palace just days after their draining 2-1 win at Real Madrid in the Champions League.\n\n\"Always when you approach the game, whoever the opponent, on your terms, good things are going to happen. There's no sense to playing football without being who you are as an individual,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"Still we are not at the top, but we are learning. We will be closer in the future. After playing in the Bernabeu, then we prepared to play the FA Cup winners.\"\n\nIt was a sweet victory for Guardiola after he was out-witted by Palace boss Oliver Glasner in last season's shock FA Cup final defeat at Wembley.\n\nPalace have been a thorn in the side of champions Liverpool, beating them three times this season, and Guardiola acknowledged the threat posed by the south Londoners.\n\n\"It's behind a lot of work. Palace are so strong. Every time we play them it's so difficult,\" he said.\n\nGuardiola conceded City are still a work in progress following his expensive overhaul of the squad since last season.\n\nBut he took heart from their willingness to fight for the win over Palace -- a vital characteristic they lacked throughout last season.\n\n\"Many things we have to improve. Madrid gave me a lot of things, that still we are not ready, not in mentality but in how to approach certain games. They are young some of the players. But 3-0 here is a big statement for us,\" he said.\n\n\"When you win in the past, you believe the past was perfect, always brilliant, always the red carpet. When we won with 100 points, all the things we achieved, we had a lot of games like today. The resilience was part of that.\n\n\"There are moments that you struggle. Madrid was not the perfect game, but it was a step. We fought unbelievably to achieve that.\n\n\"We are in a better position than last season. We are close in the competitions we are in,\" Guardiola added.",

A pillar of what makes Boston's atypical approach to the sport on both ends of the ball work at a fairly high level, Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla was recently asked about that tendency after a recent Celtics practice, specifically regarding Boston's backcourt starters, Derrick White and Payton Pritchard.\n\n\"We have a little bit more spacing, more dribble drive,\" began the Celtics coach via CLNS Media. \"It just makes the two-on-ones a little bit easier to see.\"\n\n\"I mean, we've always been a relatively knock-on-wood, a good taking care of the basketball team that helps us control the shot margin,\" he added.\n\n\"So, I mean, they're smart players,\" said Mazzulla They can handle, they can shoot off pick and rolls. They can make good decisions.\"\n\n\"Really, it's just about what they're able to do when they have the ball in their hands.\"\n\nListen to \"Havlicek Stole the Pod\" on:\n\nBlue Wire: https://tiny.ee/CdKp\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: Mazzulla on how White, Pritchard keep turnovers low with Celtics",

    "description": "Jaxon Smith-Njigba is one of the best wideouts in the game, and our expert NFL predictions expect him to find the paint against the Indianapolis Colts.",
    "fullText": "The 8-5 Indianapolis Colts continue their free fall, turning to Philip Rivers in their trip to Lumen Field to take on the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nMy Colts vs. Seahawks predictions are taking Indy's offense out of the equation, instead focusing on the special talent of Jaxon Smith-Njigba.\n\nFind out \n\nColts vs Seahawks Best bet: Jaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown (-120)\n\nThis is a nightmare matchup scenario for the Indianapolis Colts with the NFL's leading receiver this season lining up against them on the outside.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba has nine touchdowns this season, with multi-touchdown games in two of his last three.\n\nThe Colts have allowed 18 passing touchdowns this season to only 13 rushing touchdowns. Most of those touchdowns have come to receivers that have lined up outside compared to the slot position and on the line.\n\nSmith-Njigba has aligned out wide on 77.4% of his routes this season compared to only 14.8% of routes last season. From wide alignment, he has averaged 12.0 yards per target and caught eight touchdowns.\n\nThe Colts have only allowed 7.4 yards per target to receivers aligned out wide, but they have given up 13 touchdowns, which is tied for second-most in the NFL.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks rank third in the NFL in deep passing and seventh in long passing. Most of that is because of JSN and his ability to make big plays downfield. The Colts' defense ranks 22nd and 26th in those two categories.\n\nThis is a matchup tailor-made for Smith-Njigba to find the endzone.\n\nTo add to my best bet, I'm adding Kenneth Walker III to stay Under his rushing total, as he does most of his damage on outside runs, and the Colts are excellent at defending those.\n\nFinally, I am taking Alec Pierce to stay Under his receptions, as he is a serious deep threat mostly, and I don’t expect Rivers to be launching too many of those in his return.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown\n\nKenneth Walker III Under 57.5 rushing yards\n\nAlec Pierce Under 2.5 receptions\n\nWith Rivers starting, I expect Jonathan Taylor to be heavily involved in both the passing and running games, and he will be needed to literally do it all.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown\n\nKenneth Walker III Under 57.5 rushing yards\n\nAlec Pierce Under 2.5 receptions\n\nJonathan Taylor Over 97.5 rushing + receiving yards\n\nJonathan Taylor anytime touchdown\n\nThere is no chance that Rivers and the Colts will be able to come into Seattle and beat a team still desperately fighting for the NFC West.\n\nThe Seahawks have a great pass rush, and that is going to be trouble for a 44-year-old quarterback who hasn’t played in five years.\n\nThe Under has hit in three of the last five Colts games, and the Seahawks have only allowed nine points in the previous two games combined, and they haven’t allowed a touchdown in eight quarters.\n\nSpread: Colts +10 (-110) | Seahawks -10 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Colts +425 | Seahawks -600\n\nOver/Under: Over 43.5 (-110) | Under 43.5 (-110)\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts have only hit the moneyline in three of their last 10 away games.

    "description": "John Cena reflects on winning 17 world titles, claims he was unsure about surpassing Ric Flair's iconic championship record due to his respect for the legend.",
    "fullText": "Just three months into his farewell tour this year, John Cena captured his 17th world title when he defeated Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41, officially surpassing Ric Flair's long-standing record of 16 world championships. Cena originally tied Flair in 2017 when he finally scored a victory over AJ Styles, but for years fans questioned if WWE would allow the 48-year-old to become the sole holder of the milestone. However, Cena himself was unsure about beating Flair's record, as he outlined his respect for \"The Nature Boy\" during in an interview on \"Insight,\" and hopes to one day congratulate the performer that wins 18 world titles.\n\n\"I have been apprehensive for quite some time for that because I love Ric. Super mentor to me. Always been a great guy to me and I love him. I meant what I said in the press conference at Rumble ... I want to win 17 so I can shake the hand of the performer that wins 18. So what it meant to me personally was like, hey youngins, one of them is going to be you or you better get working because I don't want to be in the ground when 18 happens. I want to shake somebody's hand and something that's impossible is now possible. So that's what it means to me of hopefully by my actions, this is possible, and holy hell this guy wants to shake my hand when I pass it and I can't wait to do that.\"\n\nCena's Undisputed WWE Championship reign would last 105 days before he was dethroned by Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam this past August. Cena never received an opportunity to win back the gold, and instead set his sights on the Intercontinental Title, where he would defeat Dominik Mysterio and officially become a Grand Slam Champion.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "title": "Panthers vs Saints Predictions, Picks & Best Bets for Today's NFL Week 15 Game",
    "description": "Our Panthers vs. Saints predictions see Rico Dowdle starring in a Carolina victory in Week 15.",
    "fullText": "The Carolina Panthers can take another step toward a playoff berth — their first since 2017 — with a win at New Orleans today.\n\nMy Panthers vs. Saints predictions and NFL picks call for the Panthers to roll as road favorites on Sunday, December 14.\n\nPanthers vs Saints Best bet: Panthers moneyline (-156)\n\nThe Carolina Panthers have been wandering through the desert since Cam Newton's peak. They have a seven-season playoff drought and have gone through coaches and starting quarterbacks like Gatorade cups on the sidelines under fiery owner David Tepper.\n\nDave Canales and former top overall pick Bryce Young have stabilized things, however. Carolina has already matched its best win total of the last eight seasons, and the Panthers are in first place in the division by a half game. If they win this week and next, they'll wrap up the division crown before week 17.\n\nCarolina is a road favorite this week, just the second time that's happened in three years. The Panthers haven't handled success well this season. Just as the team seems ready to take a step forward, it's fallen on its face.\n\nThat pattern includes embarrassing losses to the Bills at home and the 49ers on Monday Night Football. It also consists of a 17-7 home loss to these Saints in November.\n\nThat game was the best start of the season for New Orleans Saints rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, who had a career-high 282 passing yards against the Panthers.\n\nAs if the promise of a playoff berth weren't motivation enough, the Panthers will be looking for a bit of revenge against Shough and the Saints, whom several players on Carolina feel they may have overlooked in that first matchup.\n\nThe Saints' offense is bottom five in the league in scoring, turnovers lost, passing touchdowns, and the major rushing categories (yards, TDs, and per carry average).\n\nThe Saints have lost three straight ATS at home, and last week's upset at Tampa Bay was their first time topping the 20-point mark in eight games.\n\nBoth teams have low-scoring offenses. The Saints are in the bottom five in most categories, and Carolina is one of the five worst scorers and, other than rushing yards, is in the bottom half of the NFL in most offensive measures. \n\nThe Panthers have gone under in the last three games; their over/under was as low as 40.5, including the 17-7 (-38) loss to the Saints last month. New Orleans has gone under four of the previous five times they've seen a total of 40.5 or lower, including twice over the previous four games.\n\nThis game should be a low-scoring battle of field goals, but the Panthers will give the ball to Rico Dowdle to kill the clock in the second half. He'll likely reward them with a late touchdown to seal things in what may be the game's only trip to the end zone.\n\nAfter just over a month as a starter, the league has enough film on Shough. He had his worst passing day since his first NFL start last week at Tampa Bay (144 yards).\n\nThis week, he'll be without his top running back as Alan Kamara has been ruled out. Kamara is also a valuable dump-off passing target for Shough, who will be facing a Panthers defense that can apply pressure and force turnovers.\n\nRico Dowdle Over 56.5 rushing yards\n\nTyler Shough under 202.5 passing yards\n\nTyler Shough under 31.5 yards longest pass\n\nThe Panthers are dialed in and ready to break their win one/lose one streak, while the Saints have nothing to play for and will be down one of their top offensive contributors in Kamara. Carolina should be ready to take a step toward wrapping up the division.\n\nWhat you see is what you get with the Panthers. Their ATS outcome has matched their straight-up one for the last 10 games. This is an unfamiliar spot for them, as they haven't been a road favorite very often. Still, in a game that will likely be an old-school smashmouth affair, they should be able to control the time of possession and put the game away late with a superior running game.\n\nThis game will feature plenty of threes and a shortage of sevens. Neither quarterback is a proven playmaker. Young is in game manager mode, and, for this game, that means not taking risks and getting the team in scoring position.\n\nSpread: Panthers -2.5 (-110) | Saints +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Panthers -135 | Saints +115\n\nOver/Under: Over 40 (-110) | Under 40 (-110)\n\nThe New Orleans Saints have hit the team total Under in 12 of their last 20 games.

In the second half he was outstanding.\"\n\nOliver Glasner's Palace, who beat City in last season's FA Cup final, squandered their chances in the first half, with Yeremy Pino hitting the bar when he had only goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to beat.\n\nHaaland was a largely peripheral figure but came alive shortly before half-time, heading a pinpoint Matheus Nunes cross across Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson to give City the lead.\n\nPalace again started the second half brightly and Wharton cracked a low drive against the base of the post.\n\nBut they paid the price for their wayward finishing when Foden drilled expertly into the bottom corner after a powerful run from Rayan Cherki to double the visitors' lead.\n\nCity added gloss to the scoreline when Haaland thundered a penalty past Henderson after Savinho was taken down by the goalkeeper following a surging run late in the game.\n\nVilla started their match at the London Stadium as the form team in the league, with nine wins in 10 matches.\n\nThe visitors fell behind twice, to Mateus Fernandes' goal after just 29 seconds and a poacher's strike from Jarrod Bowen.\n\nBut a Konstantinos Mavropanos own goal cancelled out the opener and Morgan Rogers hauled Villa level at 2-2, before the England midfielder capped a sparkling performance with a stunning shot from outside the box.\n\nThe victory leaves Unai Emery's men just three points behind Arsenal, while West Ham remain stuck in the relegation zone.\n\nIt is an astonishing turnaround for Villa, who did not score a single Premier League goal in their first four matches of the season.\n\nTwo goals from Callum Hudson-Odoi and a screamer from Ibrahim Sangare gave Forest a comfortable victory over troubled Spurs and lifted Sean Dyche's Forest five points above the drop zone.\n\nUnder-fire Tottenham manager Thomas Frank insisted he would be given time to solve their issues.\n\n\"I can't see why not. I think it's pretty evident that if no one gets the time, no one can turn this around. This is not a quick fix,\" he said.\n\nNewcastle are languishing in 12th place in the table after sinking to a 1-0 defeat at the home of local rivals Sunderland, courtesy of Woltemade's blunder in the opening minutes of the second half.\n\nThe two teams were facing each other for the first time in the Premier League for nearly a decade after the Black Cats' recent return to the top division.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin extended his hot streak as Leeds rescued a 1-1 draw at Brentford.\n\nJordan Henderson bagged his first goal for Brentford in the 70th minute, but Calvert-Lewin notched his fourth goal in his last four games with an 82nd minute header.\n\nLeeds sit three points above the relegation zone, while Brentford are seven points ahead of the bottom three.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nErling Haaland is leading the way in the Premier League Golden Boot race.\n\nMohamed Salah equaled the Premier League record for goal contributions in a single season last campaign, scoring 29 goals to win the Golden Boot while pairing it with 18 assists to put himself in contention for the Ballon d'Or.\n\nHowever, he already appears out of the running after Haaland once again reached double figures in quick time. He moved to 14 with a goal in City's 3-1 win over Liverpool on November 9, even though he missed a penalty earlier in the contest.\n\nBrentford's Igor Thiago has established himself as Haaland's main challenger. Igor's five goals in four matches in November saw him named Premier League Player of the Month.\n\nHaaland's brace in a 3-0 win at Crystal Palace on December 14 took him to 17 for the season. Phil Foden continued his fine run of form at Selhurst Park and is one of a cluster of players on seven goals. Another is Hugo Ekitike, whose double helped Liverpool to a much-needed 2-0 win over Brighton earlier in the weekend.\n\nThe Sporting News details the chase for the Premier League top goal-scorer award, which will be a heated battle throughout the 2025/26 season.\n\nMORE:All the latest EPL club news | Latest Premier League scores and schedule | Premier League standings\n\nTable updated after games on Sunday, December 14\n\nAssists serve as the first tiebreaker for the Premier League top scorer, followed by a lower minutes-per-goal value.\n\nMORE: Premier League's all-time top scorers\n\nBelow are the top scorers in each season of the Premier League era (since 1992-93).\n\nAndrew Cole and Alan Shearer saw their record for most goals in a Premier League season shattered by Erling Haaland in 2022/23.\n\nThierry Henry finished atop the Premier League scoring chart in four different seasons, more than any player all-time until Mohamed Salah equaled his mark in 2024/25. Shearer and Harry Kane follow with three scoring titles each.\n\nMORE: Premier League all-time top scorers\n\nLiverpool star Mohamed Salah ran away with the 2024/25 Premier League Golden Boot award, equaling the league record for most goal contributions in a season. The Egyptian scored 29 goals and assisted 18 more for a combined 47 total contributions.\n\nNewcastle striker Isak burst onto the scene by finishing second with 23 goals, while ever-present Haaland was third with 22. Mbeumo and Cunha both secured moves to Manchester United in the ensuing summer by finishing in the top 10, while Chris Wood helped Nottingham Forest qualify for Europe with a sensational season of his own.\n\nErling Haaland secured his second consecutive Premier League Golden Boot in 2023/24 with 27 goals, despite a mid-season injury. He led Manchester City to another title, finishing five goals ahead of Chelsea's Cole Palmer, who surged with a record-breaking hat-trick.\n\nIsak placed third with 21 goals. Haaland scored against all 22 league opponents and capped City's title with a double against Tottenham.\n\nErling Haaland won the 2022/23 Premier League Golden Boot with a new Premier League single-season record of 36 goals.\n\nThe City striker had built an insurmountable lead over Harry Kane (30 goals), who previously won the Golden Boot three times. Brentford's Ivan Toney was the other to hit the 20-goal mark, while the previous season's joint-top scorer Salah slowly rose up the ranks to fourth.\n\nIt came down to the final day of the 2021/22 season between Tottenham's Son Heung-min and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.\n\nSon's two goals at Norwich City on the final day allowed him to momentarily move ahead of Salah in the scoring table. But the Liverpool star came off the bench and netted late to catch Son, as the two stars shared the Golden Boot on 23 goals.\n\nMORE:Full Premier League goalscoring leaders & statistics from 2021/22 season",

    "fullText": "Aberdeen fans have been allowed to buy alcohol at Pittodrie Stadium - the first trial of its kind at a Scottish Premiership match since a ban was introduced 44 years ago.\n\nHome supporters were allowed to purchase drinks in the stadium concourse before kick-off in Sunday's 2-1 win against Kilmarnock.\n\nAberdeen City Council granted a one-off licence with strict conditions to gather information on whether a relaxation of the ban could be introduced safely.\n\nThe Scottish government says it has no current plans to change the law but it has allowed pilot schemes to go ahead.\n\nBBC Scotland News spoke to several Dons fans who felt the experiment went well and had enhanced the experience for supporters.\n\nGary McIntosh from Stonehaven said it was \"a long time coming\" and a chance to show that people can \"behave like an adult\".\n\n\"You can drink at rugby, you can drink at ice hockey, you can drink at football matches down south. Why not up here?\" he said.\n\nHe said many fans already enjoyed a drink in the pub before a match so there was little difference in being allowed to do so in the stadium.\n\nAberdeen heap misery on Kilmarnock in comeback win\n\nAberdeen to trial alcohol sales at Scottish Premiership match\n\nAnother fan, Kevin Randall, said: \"If everyone's sensible I think it's a great idea, long may it continue.\n\n\"It happens in every country in Europe and seems to work OK so I don't see why it can't happen in Scotland.\"\n\nCraig McIntosh said a small minority of fans could spoil it for the majority but he believed it would work well in Aberdeen.\n\n\"Whether it works everywhere? That's a different story,\" he added.\n\n\"But we go to games down in England and it's a great experience going for a few beers beforehand and you're supporting the club as well, making some money out of it.\"\n\nThe alcohol ban - which does not cover hospitality sections of grounds - was introduced following a riot during the 1980 Scottish Cup final between Rangers and Celtic at Hampden.\n\nThe Scottish Beer and Pub Association (SBPA) argues the restrictions are outdated and it would like to see a season-long trial being held, paving the way for a possible permanent lifting of the ban.\n\nTrials have recently been held at matches at Arbroath, Ayr United, Queen of the South and Stirling Albion prior to the start of the league season.\n\nSt Johnstone was also granted permission to sell alcohol to supporters at two games but the Pittodrie trial was the first for a top-flight match.\n\nA legislative change would be required to amend part of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 to allow the regular sale of alcohol at football stadiums.\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Our position on alcohol sales at Scottish football grounds has not changed.\n\n\"It is for local licensing authorities and Police Scotland to satisfy themselves that the pilot projects are permissible within the current legislative framework when granting licences.\"\n\nAberdeen to trial alcohol sales at Scottish Premiership match\n\nPolice 'open to discussions' on football booze ban",

Unfortunately, it came with one major physical drawback.\n\nOn Instagram, Grey revealed that she competed in the WBFF event with a torn ACL she had sustained during her TBS Championship match against Mone on \"Collision.\" As such, she will soon undergo surgery to address her knee injury, which will keep her sidelined for an extended period of time. In the meantime, though, Grey sported a bedazzled knee brace for her December 13th event and earned the status of being a WBFF Pro Fitness Diva.\n\n\"For those that may not know, I tore my ACL last week in my match with Mercedes,\" Grey wrote. \"I'll be going into surgery and will be out of commission for a while. This couldn't have happened at a worse time. Not only did it affect my championship match, a MAJOR opportunity for me, but it happened one week out from the @wbffentertainment show that I had invested so much of my life into the past year. People expected me to drop out, but honey, there's no quit in me. I'm a boss ass baddie, and I always get the job done. Strapped up, blinged out my knee brace and it was go time! The devil tried to take this away from me but God said nope!\"\n\nToward the end of her in-ring encounter with Mone, Grey charged into the corner with a knee strike. Upon impact, Grey then dropped to the mat and clutched her knee, signaling a potential injury. Still, she continued and followed with a bulldog before Mone rolled into the Statemaker Maker for a submission win. As of now, there is no official word on whether the knee strike or another move resulted in Grey's torn ACL.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "On Thursday at Northwestern’s bowl game press conference, Wildcat head coach David Braun said that watching Central Michigan tape is like looking in a mirror. He’s right in more ways than one.\n\nNorthwestern’s opponent in the GameAbove Sports Bowl runs the ball hard and plays tough defense. CMU Linebacker Jordan Kwiatkowski spends as much time in opposing backfields as Wildcat safety Robert Fitzgerald. Toss in a senior quarterback — who, like Northwestern’s Preston Stone, came by way of the transfer portal. a three-deep running back by committee that features two underclassmen, and Mount Pleasant starts to have shades of Evanston-North.\n\n“I’m from Iowa originally, so I’ve been following coach Braun’s career since he was at [Northern Iowa] and then NDSU, and I’ve got a couple guys on my staff that have crossed paths with him,” said Central Michigan head coach Matt Drinkall. “You knew exactly when you drew them in the bowl game, like, ‘Oh man, I already know what this film is going to look like.’”\n\nDrinkall, a former offensive assistant at Army, was hired a year ago to right the ship after three consecutive losing seasons. He didn’t inherit a crisis like Northwestern’s 2023 hazing scandal, but seven wins in year one is still an accomplishment with real weight. His Chippewas entered the final week of the season with a shot at the MAC Championship.\n\nIt’s no secret that bowl season isn’t what it once was. Nine teams have declined bowl invitations thus far in 2025, including a 10-2 Notre Dame side that chose to end its season after missing out on the College Football Playoff. Countless more juniors and seniors will end their college football careers prematurely, opting out of a bowl game to focus on the NFL Draft. Who can blame them?\n\nBut then again, you can’t tell the story of Northwestern’s 2023 season without the Las Vegas Bowl. That 14-7 fistfight of a victory over Utah is up there in the pantheon of Wildcat football history. Ben Bryant’s Tyson Fury, get-off-the-mat moment before throwing a perfect ball to Bryce Kirtz for the go-ahead touchdown. That’s Northwestern legend Ben Bryant to you. `\n\nAll those seniors, the group who stayed after a 1-11 season without a win on America soil and after their coach was fired in a scandal that became a national embarrassment.\n\n“This senior class is incredibly personal to me,” he said. “I got hired here [in December], and we started up operations in mid-January. The portal opened two teams with this group of seniors, and the ones that stayed had two different opportunities to leave.”\n\nCentral Michigan will have its shot at its own Las Vegas Bowl moment in Detroit. Drinkall’s Chippewas got killed in its only two matchups against Power Four opponents in 2025, falling by a combined 88 points to Pittsburgh and Michigan in Weeks 2 and 3. Drinkall said his team relishes the chance at redemption.\n\nNorthwestern is now two years removed from Las Vegas, and the GameAbove Sports Bowl is a far cry from the championship aspirations set out by its head coach, even if most didn’t have the ‘Cats sniffing six wins in 2025. The stakes feel elevated by the $860 million stadium project that should be ready for kickoff in 2026.\n\nA little more than a month ago, with Northwestern on the precipice of bowl eligibility after an upset win over Penn State and a 19-0 shellacking of Purdue, coach Braun told reporters that he was not satisfied with six wins.\n\n“Nowhere on our list of goals does it say, ‘make a bowl game,’” he said. “Nowhere does it say, ‘beat Purdue.’ This team set out to do something really special this year.”\n\nThe goal remains a Big Ten championship and the College Football Playoff — on Thursday, Braun made sure we knew that just about every time he opened his mouth — but that does not mean that Northwestern’s matchup against Central Michigan is a meaningless football game.\n\nAsk Caleb Tiernan, Northwestern’s beast of a left tackle who will be among the first offensive linemen selected in the NFL Draft come April. Braun told reporters that he and offensive line coach Bill O’Boyle were trying to manage Tiernan’s reps ahead of the bowl game, nervous at the possibility of anything going wrong that could impact his NFL future.\n\n“Caleb, day two of practice…comes over to coach O’Boyle and says, ‘Hey, you’re not managing my reps today. I showed up to practice today to get better,’” said Braun. “I think that embodies who our team is, what we’re about and how much this full opportunity means to this team.”\n\nThe bowl game provides Northwestern with an opportunity to develop its young players — Braun shouted out true freshmen Elijah Jones, Jon Jon Stevens and Trey Boyd by name — but the focus remains on the seniors. Sophomore quarterback Ryan Boe will have to wait another day for his first career start. Preston Stone will get the chance to end his college football career with a victory.\n\n“We’ve got to do a really good job around college football not diminish how much it means to play in a bowl game,” said Braun. “We’ve got to protect that. I don’t have answers, but that’s something as a college football community we’ve got to figure out, because it matters. When it starts to not matter, we’ve got to evaluate how we’re doing things.”\n\nNorthwestern has been slow to adapt to many of the new realities of the current college football landscape, but Braun’s emphasis on postseason football is one relic of the past that ‘Cats fans should be proud of. It matters that the seniors take pride in their one last ride.\n\nPlaying for a trophy matters, especially given the state of this program two-and-a-half years ago. The standards can and should be higher than the GameAbove Sports Bowl against an opponent from the MAC. But for the next two weeks, it’s worth appreciating the opportunity to win two bowl games in three years.",

    "description": "New England is looking to clinch the AFC East on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are back from their bye and welcoming the Buffalo Bills to a snowy Gillette Stadium in Week 15.\n\nAs Mike Vrabel stated this week, it’s a championship week for his Patriots: a win would clinch the team its first AFC East title since 2019. It will be no easy task, however, as reigning MVP Josh Allen, James Cook and one of the league’s best run games stands on the other side.\n\nFollow along live from Gillette Stadium throughout Sunday.\n\nSunday, Dec. 14, 1 p.m. ET | Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, MA | Broadcast information | Inactives | Game day roster\n\nThe Bills won the toss and deferred, putting Drake Maye and the Patriots offense on the field first. The first play from scrimmage saw a handoff to Rhamondre Stevenson and the back break free up the middle for 15 yards. Then facing a 3rd-and-7, Maye perfectly placed a fade to Kayshon Boutte down the right sideline for 30 yards to quickly have New England in Buffalo territory. Quickly getting on the ball to avoid a challenge, New England moved the chains again on the ground to set up a goal-to-go situation. One play later, Drake Maye kept a zone read and found the end zone from eight yards out. [Patriots 7 : 0 Bills]\n\n.@DrakeMaye2 caps a 🔥 first drive#ProBowlVote | #NEPats \n\n📺 CBS pic.twitter.com/HXOwMV35E9\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) December 14, 2025\n\nA 45-yard kick return by Ray Davis started the Bills first drive on the other side of the 50-yard line. A first-down deep completion to Brandin Cooks — that would’ve found Buffalo in the red zone — was overturned out of bounds which eventually set up an opening 3rd-and-5, where Allen’s pass was over an open Dalton Kincaid forcing a punt.\n\nNew England’s next drive started backed up at their own 12-yard line. After picking up an opening first-down on the ground, the unit faced a 3rd-and-1 where a pass from Maye to Mack Hollins fell incomplete.\n\nBuffalo’s second drive of the afternoon began with a 3rd-and-10 following a false start, which led to New England bringing pressure and bringing Allen down for a sack.\n\nStarting at midfield, Maye shrugged off a Bills defender in the backfield to avoid a sack and broke free for a 17-yard gain. A throw-back from Maye to Stevenson back to Maye then had the QB find Mack Hollins to move things into the red zone. Then set up in a goal-to-go situation, a second-down QB draw saw Maye break through the offensive line with his legs for another rushing touchdown. [Patriots 14 : 0 Bills]",

Frustratingly bad, even terrible performance.\n\nBayern once again undone by low blocks and set-pieces. This has been a thing (mainly inability to break down low blocks) for at least five years now and nothing has changed.\n\nSerge Gnabry has been poor, Lennart Karl has been great. Kim Min-jae and Josip Stanisic were poor for both goals; Manuel Neuer somehow poor in both. The midfielder that played 61 minutes was nonexistent. The referee was a joke. A lot of things went against Bayern’s way.\n\nHarry Kane once again rescues Bayern from dropping any more points.\n\nThat’s all, everyone. Bayern’s last match of the year is away to Heidenheim. See you then.\n\n87’ — TOR! Harry Kane scores from a penalty!\n\n73’ — Nicolas Jackson replaces Kim Min-jae.\n\n68’ — This is Mainz’s only other chance and they’ve scored from it.

The carnival team probably put three points in their Christmas wishlist because they’ve lost nine matches and won a single game and drew the other three at this point in time. Similarly, they should add luck on said list because taking down Bayern, regardless of the team they roll out, will need a Christmas miracle.\n\nLet’s see what Bayern have on their wishlist; the board told us not to leak this, but it wouldn’t hurt to have a look inside:\n\nLots of interesting stuff in there, but not as interesting as their match today (hopefully from a Bayern perspective only). The Nullfünfer can and will try to take the win, but Bayern will simply stand firm and score a couple goals while they’re at it.\n\nWhile waiting for the match, do consider listening to the latest episode of Bavarian Podcast Works!

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a five-game stint on the sideline due to a quad injury, Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry returned to game action against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. There was no visible rust for the two-time MVP as he pored in 39 points in the contest. Unfortunately for Golden State, Curry’s production wasn’t enough in the end, as they lost the game, 127-120.\n\nThe Warriors will be back in action when they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday night. The question is, will Curry be back in action also?\n\nQuad injuries can be tricky, so sometimes players might miss a game out of precaution after a return from such an injury. However, that won’t be the case with Curry. The star guard isn’t listed on the official injury report for the game, so he’ll be good to go and available to play.",

    "fullText": "Both Bayern Munich and Mainz were in action in midweek, with the Bundesliga leaders presenting the first league challenge for Urs Fischer as Mainz head coach.\n\nThe first half went as you would expect it. Bayern dominated possession while the visitors had to rely on goalkeeper Daniel Batz to make several saves.\n\nMainz had the first meaningful chance of the game, hitting the crossbar from an awkward chance, but it would be Bayern who would open the scoring in the 29th minute when Lennart Karl converted a cut back from Serge Gnabry. The goal was the league leader’s 50th of the season, and in doing so, they became the quickest team to reach the margin, beating a record they set themselves back in 2019/20.\n\nFor Fischer’s side, it was then about holding on and hoping for just one opportunity and that came just before half-time when a William Bøving free-kick was headed in by Kacper Potuslki to score his first ever goal for the club.\n\nThe trend of the second 45 minutes went the same as the first, with Bayern dominating the ball and looking for a way to break down the solid Mainz defence.\n\nHowever, against the run of play, the 05ers took an unlikely lead when Stefan Bell’s looping pass was met by the head of Jae-Sung Lee, who made it 2-1.\n\nMainz continued to absorb the pressure that Bayern threw at them, with Nicolas Jackson firing an effort straight across the face of the goal, but the Rekordmeister’s blushes would be saved when Potuslki would pull on the shirt of Harry Kane, who went to ground, resulting in a penalty for Bayern. The Englishman would, of course, convert it to rescue a point for Vincent Kompany’s side.\n\nDespite throwing away a potential vital three points, it was a positive first game for Fischer as Mainz’s head coach, and with a relegation six-pointer next week against St.Pauli, they have definitely built momentum following this performance.",

    "description": "Before hosting Miami in the CFP, Texas A&M Edge Cashius Howell and WR KC Concepcion are projected as first-round NFL Draft selections.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is just six days away from hosting Miami (FL) (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff, as both teams are headed to the tournament for the first time in program history, and will meet for the third time in the last three seasons.\n\nOn paper, both teams are highly similar, possessing NFL talent on both sides of the ball, and their starting quarterbacks, Marcel Reed and Carson Beck, each threw for 25 touchdowns and 10 interceptions during the regular season, connecting with elite playmakers.\n\nFor the Hurricanes, freshman wideout Malachi Toney is a nightmare matchup. At the same time, Texas A&M transfer wide receivers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver combined for over 1,700 yards and 15 total touchdowns, and are a mismatch for every secondary they've faced this season. With Craver expected to return next season, Concepcion will likely declare for the NFL Draft.\n\nOn defense, Texas A&M edge Cashius Howell and Miami defensive lineman Rueben Bain are both considered top 10 prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft, and have a chance to solidify their standing as elite pass rushers on Saturday afternoon. Either way, both players are headed to the draft regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis week, Pro Football Focus's Trevor Sikkema released his latest 2026 Mock Draft, projecting Cashius Howell as the 6th overall pick to the Washington Commanders, who would join former Texas A&M and future Hall of Fame defensive end Von Miller for at least one season.\n\nThe Commanders defense is in a bad place right now, and it starts up front. Howell will face plenty of skepticism about his draft range, given his very short arms for the position, yet he has earned pass-rush grades above 90.0 in three straight seasons, with win rates above 19.0% over that same span.\n\nConcepcion, who finished his first season in College Station with 57 receptions and a team-high 886 receiving yards and 9 touchdowns, paired with two punt return scores, is the perfect addition for any team looking for a Day 1 starting slot receiver and punt returner. According to Sikkema, the San Francisco 49ers will be looking to replace Debo Samuels for the first time in two seasons.\n\nWithout Deebo Samuel, it feels like the 49ers are missing that go-to yards after catch receiver. They are using running back Christian McCaffrey a lot for that, but it’s not quite the same as scheming things up for a receiver. Concepcion is averaging more than 7.0 yards after the catch this year and has that kind of acceleration and athleticism.\n\nFor the Aggies to have any shot at making it to the quarterfinals against No. 2 Ohio State, both Conecpcion and Howell will need to play their best football.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Two Texas A&M starters projected as first-round NFL Draft picks",

    "description": "A retired lawyer lost the money in a tech support scam, a type of online fraud that is surging. Citibank said it couldn’t recover the funds, which criminals wired from inside his account.",
    "fullText": "David Welles, a retired lawyer, had been struggling with his new iPad for hours when he tried to call tech support.\n\nBut instead of dialing Microsoft to help him connect his email, the phone number he found on Google put him in touch with cybercriminals.\n\nThe smooth talking scammer who answered called himself Alex and built a rapport with Mr. Welles, assuring him that he could resolve his tech headaches. Before too long, Mr. Welles downloaded remote access software, both on his iPhone and his laptop, allowing the scammer to burrow deep inside of his devices, where he stored his username and passwords on his hard drive.\n\n“A big mistake,” said Mr. Welles, who is 87. “All of a sudden, on the laptop, I could see it going blank, and little lights flashing around.”\n\nThe scammer wore him down over a series of calls over nearly five hours, according to text messages and other records. Finally, a little after 7 p.m., Mr. Welles called his work assistant and told her he had been on the line with Microsoft all day.\n\nShe immediately sensed something was off.\n\nThey quickly called the scammer on a three-way call. But they had no idea Alex had already made a wire transfer of $85,000 from Mr. Welles’s checking account at Citibank.\n\nIt seems Citi didn’t immediately notice either — even after Mr. Welles and his assistant contacted the bank to alert it of the scammer, just three hours after the money left Mr. Welles’s account.\n\nCybercrime has become a global, industrialized operation that captures billions of dollars from Americans every year. Con artists create sophisticated schemes by exploiting basic tech — planting malicious ads bought from search engines or social media companies, buying phone lines and sending deceptive text messages from VoIP providers and more.\n\nThen they do their best to slide through the banking system undetected with their ill-gotten gains. If they can move money from a customer’s own account and devices, it’s far less likely to set off any alarm bells.\n\nAccount takeovers — including those similar to Mr. Welles’s— are surging, having tripled over the past five years, according to an analysis of Treasury data by David Maimon, a criminal justice professor and director of a cybersecurity research group at Georgia State University. In May, there were 16,556 reports filed to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, an arm of the Treasury known as FinCEN, up from 5,145 at the beginning of 2020.\n\n“From the bank side, almost everything looks legit” because the signals are coming from the customer’s electronic devices, said Professor Maimon, who is also head of fraud insights at SentiLink, a fraud prevention company.\n\nAmericans over age 60 lost roughly $982 million last year to tech support scams alone, one of the more lucrative frauds, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center. That figure is up 66 percent from 2023, but it’s still just a fraction of the estimated $16.6 billion cybercriminals took in 2024 overall, up 33 percent from the year before, and widely viewed as an under representation since so much fraud goes unreported.\n\nMany criminals move the stolen money using crypto or wire transfers, a method that carries weaker consumer protections than other electronic transfers made through online banking platforms. That issue is now at the center of a lawsuit — filed by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, against Citibank — which argues that stricter rules should apply.\n\nWhen Mr. Welles and his assistant called Citi around 8 p.m. after they hung up with the scammer, the bank told him it would freeze his accounts. But the bank didn’t flag, or even mention, that $85,000 had been wired from his account just hours earlier, at 4:45 p.m.\n\nMr. Welles said he had checked for any suspicious withdrawals, noting his balance of about $20,000 — but had forgotten that he transferred a large sum a few days earlier to pay a tax bill.\n\nAs a 50-year client of the bank, Mr. Welles said he felt confident that the bank would pick up any unusual activity. But he still had trouble sleeping that night.\n\nThe next morning, he received a call from what appeared to be Citibank’s private bank on his caller ID. “Did you make an $85,000 wire?” asked a man who called himself Michael Wink. He reassured Mr. Welles that he didn’t need to call the bank because they were already on the case.\n\nBut it was the hackers calling him.\n\nMr. Welles and his assistant called the real Citibank, which confirmed that $85,000 had indeed left his account the afternoon before. The bank then initiated a recall on the wire, but it was too late — the money had landed at Wells Fargo and had already moved on to its next destination.\n\nHad Citi set off alarm bells the night before, when Mr. Welles first called, would he have been more likely to recover his money? Citi declined to comment on the specifics of his case.\n\nThe bank refused to reimburse him, news that arrived in a letter nine days after the incident. “Based on the information provided and the results of our research, the transfer was made using your Citibank online credentials and were initiated using their registered device ID,” it said. “As a result, we’re unable to honor your claim.”\n\nWires have typically been governed by a part of the Uniform Commercial Code, designed for business transactions, which says that reimbursement isn’t necessary if “an agreed-upon commercially reasonable security procedure is in place” and the bank proves it accepted the wire order in good faith.\n\nBut Attorney General James’s legal action asserts that greater protections for consumers are warranted: She argues that Regulation E, the rules part of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, known as EFTA, should apply when wires are made available online and through mobile banking apps. That requires banks to reimburse victims, as they do with other electronic transfers or debit card fraud, when their money is lost or stolen through unauthorized electronic payments — liability is generally limited to $500 if the bank is notified within 60 days.\n\nCarla Sanchez-Adams, a senior lawyer focusing on banking and payment systems at the National Consumer Law Center, agreed with the suit’s position and said transfers that were initiated the same way, electronically, should come with similar protections. From the consumer’s perspective, she added, “it’s all the same.”\n\nBanks argue the law is settled, and that bank-to-bank wire transfers are excluded from EFTA. But consumer advocates point out that when EFTA was written in 1978, wires were rarely used for consumers — and certainly not through online banking, which didn’t exist.\n\nIn January, a Federal District Court judge denied Citi’s request to dismiss New York’s suit, a decision that Citi appealed in September. A coalition of other banks and credit unions have lined up behind Citi, filing an amicus brief supporting its appeal to the Second Circuit.\n\nSome financial institutions are already threatening that a “seismic shift in regulatory treatment” could lead them to eliminate wires for consumers altogether.\n\nMr. Welles is still struggling to understand exactly how the fraudster pulled off the scheme. His private banker answered some of his security-related questions in an email, which said that “debit/pin verification” was used to add the wire recipient, and a one-time password was sent via text message to confirm the wire — both of which, it seems, the scammers had accessed. Mr. Welles later learned from a police report that the money was wired to an account registered under the name Adedela Sodiq at Wells Fargo.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesman declined to say if that account was closed or had been investigated.\n\nIn a statement, Citi said that it took client protection seriously, and that it had robust controls and processes in place. The bank said it also offered customizable alerts that customers could receive when transactions exceeded an amount they selected.\n\nThere isn’t a way to stop transactions above a certain amount from going through. When Mr. Welles asked his private bank representatives to call his adviser before making wires for more than $10,000, they told him the system itself determines the authentication required on a per-transaction basis, and it “would not be able to direct that a non-account owner be called for transactions over a certain amount,” according to their email correspondence last month.\n\nThe scam artists continued to torment Mr. Welles weeks later.\n\nHe received a call from someone calling himself Mark Wood, who claimed to be a senior investigator at Citi — and promised he would get his money back in a week or so. Mr. Welles emailed his private bankers about the incident to confirm it was indeed the fraudsters, which they did.\n\n“Fortunately, although a bit worse, I am still OK to make it through the few years I have left to live comfortably,” he said in the Sept. 24 email, but not psychologically. “Anxiety dreams,” he added.\n\nSusan C.

    "description": "Secret parties, lavish buffets, and talks of annihilation at one of the largest AI-research conferences",
    "fullText": "In a small room in San Diego last week, a man in a black leather jacket explained to me how to save the world from destruction by AI. Max Tegmark, a notable figure in the AI-safety movement, believes that “artificial general intelligence,” or AGI, could precipitate the end of human life. I was in town for NeurIPS, one of the largest AI-research conferences, and Tegmark had invited me, along with five other journalists, to a briefing on an AI-safety index that he would release the next day. No company scored better than a C+.\n\nThe threat of technological superintelligence is the stuff of science fiction, yet it has become a topic of serious discussion in the past few years. Despite the lack of clear definition—even OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has called AGI a “weakly defined term”—the idea that powerful AI contains an inherent threat to humanity has gained acceptance among respected cultural critics.\n\nGranted, generative AI is a powerful technology that has already had a massive impact on our work and culture. But superintelligence has become one of several questionable narratives promoted by the AI industry, along with the ideas that AI learns like a human, that it has “emergent” capabilities, that “reasoning models” are actually reasoning, and that the technology will eventually improve itself.\n\nI traveled to NeurIPS, held at the waterfront fortress that is the San Diego Convention Center, partly to understand how seriously these narratives are taken within the AI industry. Do AGI aspirations guide research and product development? When I asked Tegmark about this, he told me that the major AI companies were sincerely trying to build AGI, but his reasoning was unconvincing. “I know their founders,” he said. “And they’ve said so publicly.”\n\nParallel to the growth of fear and excitement about AI in the past decade, NeurIPS attendance has exploded, increasing from approximately 3,850 conference-goers in 2015 to 24,500 this year, according to organizers. The conference center’s three main rooms each have the square footage of multiple blimp hangars. Speakers addressed audiences of thousands. “I do feel we’re on a quest, and a quest should be for the holy grail,” Rich Sutton, the legendary computer scientist, proclaimed in a talk about superintelligence.\n\nThe conference’s corporate sponsors had booths to promote their accomplishments and impress attendees with their R&D visions. There were companies you’ve heard of, such as Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, ByteDance, and Tesla, and ones you probably haven’t, such as Runpod, Poolside, and Ollama. One company, Lambda, was advertising itself as the “Superintelligence Cloud.” A few of the big dogs were conspicuously absent from the exhibitor hall, namely OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI. Consensus among the researchers I spoke with is that the cachet of these companies is already so great that setting up a booth would be pointless.\n\nThe conference is a primary battleground in AI’s talent war. Much of the recruiting effort happens outside the conference center itself, at semisecret, invitation-only events in downtown San Diego. These events captured the ever-growing opulence of the industry. In a lounge hosted by the Laude Institute, an AI-development support group, a grad student told me about starting salaries at various AI companies of “a million, a million five,” of which a large portion was equity. The lounge was designed in the style of a VIP lounge at a music festival. It was, in fact, located at the top of the Hard Rock Hotel.\n\nThe place to be, if you could get in, was the party hosted by Cohere, a Canadian company that builds large language models. (Cohere is being sued for copyright and trademark infringement by a group of news publishers, including The Atlantic.) The party was held on the USS Midway, an aircraft carrier used in Operation Desert Storm, which is now docked in the San Diego harbor. The purpose, according to the event’s sign-up page, was “to celebrate AI’s potential to connect our world.”\n\nWith the help of a researcher friend, I secured an invite to a mixer hosted by the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, the world’s first AI-focused university, named for the current UAE president. Earlier this year, MBZUAI established the Institute for Foundation Models, a research group in Silicon Valley. The event, held at a steak house, had an open buffet with oysters, king prawns, ceviche, and other treats. Upstairs, Meta was hosting its own mixer. According to rumor, some of the researchers downstairs were Meta employees hoping to be poached by the Institute for Foundation Models, which supposedly offered more enticing compensation packages.\n\nOf 5,630 papers presented in the poster sessions at NeurIPS, only two mention AGI in their title. An informal survey of 115 researchers at the conference suggested that more than a quarter didn’t even know what AGI stands for. At the same time, the idea of AGI, and its accompanying prestige, seemed at least partly responsible for the buffet. The amenities I encountered certainly weren’t paid for by chatbot profits. OpenAI, for instance, reportedly expects its massive losses to continue until 2030. How much longer can the industry keep the ceviche coming? And what will happen to the economy, which many believe is propped up by the AI industry, when it stops?\n\nIn one of the keynote speeches, the sociologist and writer Zeynep Tufekci warned researchers that the idea of superintelligence was preventing them from understanding the technology they were building. The talk, titled “Are We Having the Wrong Nightmares About AI?,” mentioned several dangers posed by AI chatbots, including widespread addiction to chatbots and the undermining of methods for establishing truth. After Tufekci gave her talk, the first audience member to ask a question appeared annoyed. “Have you been following recent research?” the man asked. “Because that’s the exact problems we’re trying to fix. So we know of these concerns.” Tufekci responded, “I don’t really see these discussions. I keep seeing people discuss mass unemployment versus human extinction.”\n\nIt struck me that both might be correct: that many AI developers are thinking about the technology’s most tangible problems while public conversations about AI—including those among the most prominent developers themselves—are dominated by imagined ones. Even the conference’s name contained a contradiction: The name “NeurIPS” is short for “Neural Information Processing Systems,” but artificial neural networks were conceived in the 1940s by a logician-and-neurophysiologist duo who wildly underestimated the complexity of biological neurons and overstated their similarity to a digital computer. Regardless, a central feature of AI’s culture is an obsession with the idea that a computer is a mind. Anthropic and OpenAI have published reports with language about chatbots being, respectively, “unfaithful” and “dishonest.” In the AI discourse, science fiction often defeats science.\n\nOn the roof of the Hard Rock Hotel, I attended an interview with Yoshua Bengio, one of the three “godfathers” of AI. Bengio, a co-inventor of an algorithm that makes ChatGPT possible, recently started a nonprofit called LawZero to encourage the development of AI that is “safe by design.” He took the nonprofit’s name from a law featured in several Isaac Asimov stories that states that a robot should not allow humans to be harmed. Bengio was concerned that, in a possible dystopian future, AIs might deceive their creators and that “those who will have very powerful AIs could misuse it for political advantage, in terms of influencing public opinion.”\n\nI looked around to see if anyone else was troubled by the disconnect. Bengio did not mention how fake videos are already affecting public discourse. Neither did he meaningfully address the burgeoning chatbot mental-health crisis, or the pillaging of the arts and humanities. The catastrophic harms, in his view, are “three to 10 or 20 years” away. We still have time “to figure it out, technically.”\n\nBengio has written elsewhere about the more immediate dangers of AI. But the technical and speculative focus of his remarks captures the sentiment among technologists who now dominate the public conversation about our future. Ostensibly, they are trying to save us, but who actually benefits from their predictions? As I spoke with 25-year-olds entertaining seven-figure job offers and watched the industry’s millionaire luminaries debate the dangers of superintelligence, the answer seemed clear.",

    "description": "A definitive 2025 comparison of Vect AI, Copy.ai, and ChatGPT. Discover why specialized 'Marketing Operating Systems' are replacing generalist chatbots for serious growth teams.",
    "fullText": "Every week, a new \"ChatGPT Killer\" launches on Product Hunt. But for distinct, revenue-focused marketers, the noise is distracting. You don't need another chatbot that can write a mediocre limerick about a pirate. You don't need a tool that requires a 50-paragraph \"mega-prompt\" just to sound human.\n\nYou need a system that drives Revenue.\n\nIn 2025, the AI landscape has calcified into three distinct categories. Understanding this split is critical before you swipe your credit card.\n\nThis guide isn't just a list of features or a rehash of pricing pages. It is a \"Stress Test\" of how these tools handle the real, messy, complex work of a modern high-growth marketing team.\n\nTo understand the tool, you must understand the brain behind it. Each platform was built with a fundamentally different thesis about what a marketer needs.\n\nOpenAI built a general-purpose reasoning engine. It is brilliant at coding, summarizing history, and casual chat. But it has no \"opinion\" on marketing. It doesn't know that a headline should differ between a cold email and a landing page unless you explicitly tell it the precise psychological framework to use.\n\nCopy.ai pivoted from a simple writing tool to a \"GTM AI Platform.\" Their thesis is that marketing is a series of data flows. Scrape LinkedIn -> Enrich Data -> Write Email -> Send.\n\nVect AI was built with a single thesis: Strategy should come before generation. It assumes you want the best marketing outcome, not just any text. It is \"State-Aware\"—meaning it permanently remembers your brand voice, audience pains, and product details.\n\nLet's move away from theory and look at three common, painful scenarios every marketer faces.\n\nYou need to fix a landing page that isn't converting.\n\nChatGPT Approach:\nYou paste the text. You ask: \"Make this better.\" ChatGPT changes a few synonyms. It sounds robotic. You spend 15 minutes explaining your customer persona. It eventually gives you something passable but generic.\n\nCopy.ai Approach:\nYou look for a \"Landing Page Rewriter\" workflow. You run it. It generates 10 variations. You have to read all 10 to decide which one is good.\n\nVect AI Approach:\nYou open the Conversion Killer Detector. You paste your URL. The Agent scans the live page, identifies \"Passive Voice\" and \"Weak Value Props,\" assigns a \"Panic Score,\" and auto-rewrites the specific sections that are killing sales.\n\nYou released a new feature. You need a blog, 10 tweets, 3 LinkedIn posts, and a newsletter.\n\nCopy.ai Approach (The Engineer's Way):\n\nVect AI Approach (The Strategy Way):\n\nThis is the single biggest differentiator.\n\nChatGPT has \"Custom Instructions,\" but they are weak. It often forgets them in long threads.\nCopy.ai uses \"Brand Voice\" snippets, but you have to manually select them for every workflow.\n\nVect AI uses a Global Brand Kernel.\nWhen you onboard, you define your audience, your pain points, and your \"Anti-Persona\" (who you don't want).\n\nMost AI tools are \"Yes Men.\" If you ask them to write a boring, 3,000-word email, they will say \"Sure!\" and do it.\n\nVect AI has a conscience. It's called the Resonance Engine.\nBefore you publish, you can run your content through this simulation. It uses historical data from millions of high-performing ads and posts to predict success.\n\nOnly Vect AI protects you from looking stupid. The others just execute orders.\n\nMarketing isn't just text. It's visual.\n\nCopy.ai is purely text-based. You need a separate Midjourney subscription for images.\nChatGPT has DALL-E 3, which is fun but often too \"cartoony\" for enterprise brands.\n\nVect AI includes a commercial-grade AI Ad Creative Studio and Marketing Video Ad generator.\n\nWhen comparing prices, most people look at the monthly fee. This is a mistake. You must calculate the Time Cost.\n\nTo give you a sense of the specialization, look at how granular Vect AI gets compared to the generic \"Write an Article\" button in other tools:\n\nThe era of \"Generalist AI\" for professionals is ending. We are entering the era of \"Agentic Workflows.\"\n\nStop fighting with prompts. Stop building workflows. Start leading your market.\n\nYou have the blueprint. Now you need the engine. Launch the AI agent for \"Conversion Killer Detector\" and get results in minutes.",

    "title": "My kids went to an outdoor elementary school with no art, music, or library. They loved it, but adjusting to public school was hard.",
    "description": "My kids loved their private elementary school because they got to learn in small groups outside. They missed out on a lot, but it was worth it.",
    "fullText": "In 2019, my 5-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter were excited to start their first year of public school. But like millions of students in March of 2020, they never got to finish the school year.\n\nThe COVID pandemic closed the classrooms, forcing my husband and me to rethink how we wanted to handle our children's education. An outdoor learning school at The Learning Tree, a local day care, became our solution.\n\nThe unique education exceeded our expectations in every way.\n\nThe pandemic made us nervous to send our kids back to school after summer break. We were told that if someone in their class contracted COVID, the entire class would shut down for two weeks. This wasn't feasible for us as parents with full-time jobs, plus it would disrupt the learning experience for our kids.\n\nThat summer, the day care our kids attended prior to starting school announced a new opportunity: a K/1 program focused on interactive, accelerated education. It promised small class sizes (roughly 12 students per class), project-based and student-led learning, and academics balanced with outdoor activities and healthy habits.\n\nDespite the $125 weekly tuition fee per child, we were sold on smaller classes, less exposure to others, and the included after-school care.\n\nWe enrolled our kids for the 2020-2021 school year: our daughter in kindergarten and our son in first grade. When the school added second grade the following year and then third grade the year after, we stayed.\n\nWe didn't plan on sending our kids to a private program for most of their elementary school years. But after comparing what public school offered that The Learning Tree didn't, and vice versa, the outdoor learning school was a no-brainer.\n\nAt The Learning Tree, there was no library, computer lab, or even a cafeteria. They didn't have art, music, or gym classes. The playground was small, and there was no option for gifted testing.\n\nHowever, they did have an in-ground swimming pool, and swimming was built into the curriculum during warm months. A mile-long nature trail and morning fitness exercises replaced the gym. Students helped to build gardens and grow food, which made its way into their lunches. Most notably, screen time was minimal — almost nonexistent.\n\nThere was also more parental involvement. We went kayaking on the river as part of a history lesson, and we always had special celebrations for Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nInstead of reading math word problems, they acted them out in real time with things like farmers' markets and food prep. Projects, not worksheets, were a focal point for each grade. And since students played a role in their own education and pacing, there was no need for a separate \"gifted\" curriculum.\n\nThe original K/1 program added a new grade each year, up to fifth grade. However, we pulled our children out when they started fourth grade to give them time to transition back into public education before middle school. Where we live, fifth grade is at the middle school, and we felt like jumping from outdoor learning to a public middle school would be too stressful.\n\nBoth of our kids already had lots of friends in public school, so it wasn't completely unfamiliar to them. Still, it was challenging.\n\nThey went from spending most of the day outside to getting only 20 minutes of recess. Classes were much larger, so they didn't have the opportunity to learn at their own pace. They had more rules and a more rigid structure to follow. There was more sitting and busywork than they were used to.\n\nThey missed the kindness and genuine interest of their teachers at their old school. They also lacked the opportunities to guide their own education and pursue their own interests in the classroom.\n\nWhile we loved our time at the outdoor learning school, all good things must end. Our kids gained a solid foundation of work ethic, self-discovery, and leadership that continues to help them in and out of the classroom, and we'd do it again in a heartbeat — pandemic or no pandemic.",

    "description": "I've driven my 2017 Volvo for over 112,000 miles, and I still love it. Keeping it has been one of my smartest choices.",
    "fullText": "When I bought my Volvo XC90 in 2017, I was thrilled to get a safe, third-row vehicle. With three kids between the ages of 3 and 8, the extra space meant fewer fights and more room, and reassured me that the car's safety features would help me drive through snowy roads and city traffic.\n\nAlmost a decade later, that same Volvo has over 112,000 miles on it. I still remember when my family and I sat on the front porch, excited, as we watched the car get delivered from the truck.\n\nThese days, my kids have been asking me when I'm going to get a new car, and my answer remains the same — I love my car and I'm going to keep driving it.\n\nAside from regular maintenance and tire changes, the car has been reliable. Before the warranty expired, we purchased an extended warranty on the vehicle. Now that the extended warranty has expired due to mileage, I am still in awe at how reliable the car has remained.\n\nYears ago, we appreciated that the trunk could hold the double stroller, and that the built-in booster seat allowed us to drive car pools with small children. These days, we appreciate the third-row flexibility that allows us to fit our skis, snowboards, soccer gear, backpacks, and all the other essentials my kids need.\n\nI spend a lot of time in the car driving people around, and I am thankful for a car I can rely on.\n\nMy mom used to say that the best car is one that reliably gets you from point A to point B. I still agree with this statement.\n\nI appreciate the small safety features that I now take for granted. From the computer technology to the warning lights on the mirrors and back-up cameras, the car has helped keep my family safe on numerous occasions and helped me avoid some near accidents.\n\nThe car is part of our family. We have taken it on adventures to national parks, ski resorts in the Rockies, and even to an alligator farm. The vehicle has had its share of muddy shoes, candy wrappers, and dog hair. It also has dings from when I backed the car into the garage.\n\nWhen my car is in the garage, the dealer provides me with a loaner car — a brand-new version of my current vehicle. I get tempted and think about how nice it would be to get a new car. The latest vehicles have more power, fewer scratches, are cleaner, and have that new-car smell.\n\nI've crunched the numbers. After years of car payments, my car is now paid off. Every month that goes by without a car payment means more money toward saving for the future. More money for food, utilities, saving for college, and the occasional splurge. Saving money now means more financial freedom for tomorrow.\n\nBuying a new car is expensive. Borrowing money for car payments these days costs more than it did in the past. Even yearly vehicle registration costs less for an older car.\n\nWe live in a world that tells us that newer is better, that we should want more. Although external validation of a new car is nice, I am focusing on the internal satisfaction that comes from knowing I am saving money by driving an older car.\n\nMy car may not turn heads in the school pick-up line, but I view the scratches and door dings much like wrinkles- a sign of a good life.\n\nI will continue to drive my older car, and I am thankful for a safe and reliable vehicle that has served my family well.",

    "title": "At this small buyout firm, talking about AI for cost-cutting is off-limits",
    "description": "Unlike their buyout peers, Tide Rock isn't looking to AI to cut costs. Instead, it's CEO told us, its using it to find new customers and deals.",
    "fullText": "Most fears and hopes surrounding AI center on its ability to save on labor costs. Whether it's Jamie Dimon predicting a three-and-a-half-day workweek, the chorus of CEOs saying that AI will help its workers get more done, or the research predicting potentially catastrophic white-collar job cuts, the focus is on efficiency.\n\nBut at one investing firm, cost-cutting is practically a forbidden word.\n\n\"The mandate across the company is don't talk about using our resources in AI or tech to cut costs or create efficiencies,\" Tide Rock CEO Ryan Peddycord told Business Insider.\n\nThe firm has had AI engineers for two years, but they're aimed at growing business, not cutting, said Peddycord.\n\nThe San Diego and New York-based firm, which invests in smaller businesses than your typical private-equity giants, does not use debt to finance its acquisitions. It manages $1 billion, including its current investments and dry powder. It has done over 50 acquisitions, with growth, not just financial engineering, as its goal.\n\n\"Our foundation is, and our principle is, that we are focused on being growth engines for these businesses, and that's where we want to focus our resources,\" Peddycord said.\n\nPeddycord spoke to Business Insider about how the firm's use of AI fits into its business model and gave some real-world examples of where it has made an impact.\n\nThe company buys founder-run businesses when founders have \"a catalyst to change,\" like their own looming retirement or an illness in their family, which means they're much more protective of the asset they're selling than your typical financial investor.\n\nThey then focus on growing those companies, which means Tide Rock hires chief marketing officers and chief revenue officers \"who know how to run businesses\" instead of your typical private equity partners, Peddycord said.\n\nThe firm's companies have seen organic revenue growth of 24% a year since Tide Rock was launched 13 years ago, said Peddycord. (He also said the firm has only lost money on one deal over that time period.)\n\nThey're looking for a way to monetize what they built over time, but really just as important to them is for their brand and their legacy and their employees to be able to kind of continue on without them,\" Peddycord said.\n\nFor founders like this, the story of growth is an essential reason they'd choose to sell to Tide Rock. As such, any discussion of using AI to cut employees or costs is anathema to their sales pitch, whereas AI for growth is a selling point.\n\nAI is becoming an integral part of the firm's strategy, but they've been doing this for years before the advent of LLMs some operational best practices in a library of over 100 videos and 500 pages of documentation.\n\n\"A CEO of a portfolio company has access to certain information, a controller has access to a different set of information, a VP of sales has access to information,\" Peddycord said.\n\nAI tools have become another operational best practice that the firm shares across the companies it manages, which it tracks in a library of 100 videos and 500 pages of documentation.\n\nThe firm also has other centralized resources in-house, \"as a bridge\" to get the businesses to a place where they can operate on their own, including a centralized talent acquisition team and centralized chief marketing and revenue officers.\n\nThis has led to a world where the firm has, for example, been able to integrate a customer relationship management system in \"30 to 45 days\" instead of \"12 to 18 months,\" said Peddycord.\n\nThe company is happy to use third-party applications that can cut costs, but it's a waste of their own resources, said Peddycord.\n\n\"I have a belief that everybody's so focused on cost-cutting that third parties are going to pick off all the low-hanging fruit there,\" Peddycord said. \"So us trying to invest our dollars to go create things that other people are creating and probably investing more dollars to do isn't the right place to spend our money.\"\n\nThe first tool they invested in was finding companies to purchase. The data on platforms like Pitchbook and Crunchbase is \"very, very incomplete\" at the sub-$10 million EBITDA level the firm invests in, said Peddycord, so the firm first invested \"heavily\" in ways to find these companies and start pitching them.\n\nSoon, the firm realized that this ability to find a lot of \"non-public information\" about companies and then reach out to them would also be \"super relevant\" for their portfolio companies when they're looking for new customers, Peddycord said.\n\nPeddycord provided the example of identifying potential customers for its manufacturing portfolio companies that sell to the government, aerospace, or defense industries.\n\n\"When Blue Origin wins a large contract, there is some public information that we are able to gather to identify what it is that they won the contract for, and we can even reverse engineer what sub-component parts and services are going to be necessary to then go create that,\" Peddycord said.\n\nFrom there, the firm's portfolio companies could \"get in the door earlier\" to offer their sub-component manufacturing help, Peddycord said.\n\n\"In those high-growth areas like aerospace and defense, they are working as hard to find new qualified suppliers as we are to find new customers,\" Peddycord said.",

    "description": "Many IT professionals would recommend Python as the best programming language for beginners. Why? The syntax of the Python code is considered simple.",
    "fullText": "TL;DR: Python leads with 29.85% market share driven by AI/ML demand, while JavaScript remains essential for web development. But here’s what most hiring managers miss: the rise of AI-powered coding tools like GitHub Copilot has fundamentally altered what skills you should prioritize when building your engineering team.\n\nThe question isn’t simply “which programming language should we hire for?” anymore. Companies are increasingly leveraging AI to automate routine coding tasks, reducing the need for large engineering teams and prioritizing professionals who can manage AI-driven workflows rather than simply write code.\n\nLet’s cut through the noise and examine what’s actually happening in today’s tech hiring landscape.\n\nSoftware developer job listings are down 35% from their 2022 peak, but don’t let that fool you into thinking demand has disappeared. Most technology positions tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show unemployment rates well below the national average—software developers at 2.8%, systems analysts at 1.8%, and security analysts at 2.3%.\n\nWhat’s changed is selectivity. Companies are becoming more selective with their technical hires while businesses struggle to ship quickly due to a shortage of qualified engineers. The old approach of scanning resumes for keyword matches no longer works when every engineer claims “full-stack” experience.\n\nPython dominates with 29.85% market share, and it’s no surprise given AI and machine learning’s explosive growth. But here’s what matters for your hiring strategy: the type of Python developer you need has evolved.\n\nTraditional Python roles focused on web development with Django or Flask. Modern Python roles require understanding of:\n\nWhen interviewing Python candidates, dig beyond syntax knowledge. Ask: “How would you architect a system that processes real-time data for ML model inference?” The answer reveals whether they understand modern Python’s role in AI-driven products.\n\nJavaScript maintains its position with 7.92% market share, remaining essential for front-end development. But traditional frontend development is seeing fewer job postings, suggesting a shift toward full-stack or specialized backend roles.\n\nThe modern JavaScript landscape demands expertise in:\n\nTypeScript continues gaining popularity for large-scale web development, with its static typing and enhanced tooling making it preferred for complex applications. If your product serves enterprise clients or handles complex state management, TypeScript experience isn’t optional, it’s essential.\n\nGo’s popularity continues to grow as global demand for cloud computing rises, with its simple syntax, built-in concurrency support, and high performance making it well-suited for cloud-native applications.\n\nRust is emerging for system-level programming where memory safety and performance are critical. Rust’s memory safety, high performance, and robust security properties make it particularly well-suited for performance- and safety-critical applications.\n\nIf your architecture includes real-time systems, embedded software, or blockchain applications, Rust expertise provides competitive advantages that Go simply cannot match.\n\nIn this article, you can find answers to these questions. Keep in mind that these are all useful languages that will bring you closer to your goal if you’re committed.\n\nDespite competition from newer languages like Kotlin and Go, Java remains widely used in enterprise software, Android development, and backend systems. But the Java developer you need in 2025 looks different from five years ago.\n\nModern Java development requires:\n\nC# has been increasingly utilized in game development and enterprise software, with deep integration with the Unity game engine cementing C# as a top game developer language. For enterprise applications, .NET’s cross-platform capabilities make C# developers valuable for modernizing legacy Windows-based systems.\n\nAccording to research for the Demand for Skilled Talent report, the most evident skills gap on technology teams is within AI, machine learning and data science. But let’s be specific about what this means for different roles:\n\nPlatform-focused AI engineers build centralized tools and infrastructure to accelerate AI development, while product-focused AI engineers work inside product teams and ship AI features for users. Understanding this distinction helps you write better job descriptions and evaluate candidates correctly.\n\nDevelopers who can maintain and modernize legacy systems are highly valued, with work including ensuring security, improving performance, and integrating legacy systems with newer technologies like APIs or microservices. Many companies underestimate this need when planning their hiring strategy.\n\nCloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure are at the core of modern software infrastructure, with over 90% of global enterprises expected to use cloud platforms by 2025.\n\nCritical cloud competencies include:\n\nWhen evaluating DevOps candidates, focus on their experience with incident response and disaster recovery. Anyone can deploy to the cloud; few can architect systems that gracefully handle failure at scale.\n\nEnterprise blockchain adoption is driving legitimate technical roles:\n\nMajor industries entering the space, including finance, healthcare and logistics, are expanding demand for blockchain engineers. When Deutsche Bank builds blockchain settlement systems or Nike creates digital collectibles, they need engineers who understand both traditional software architecture and decentralized protocols.\n\nEntry-level Solidity developers can write basic smart contracts and deploy them to testnets. Senior Solidity engineers architect systems that handle millions in value while remaining secure and gas-efficient.\n\nCore technical competencies for serious Solidity roles:\n\nFor Startups and Scale-ups: Python and JavaScript remain your best bets for rapid development and talent availability. The ecosystem maturity and hiring pool depth outweigh cutting-edge performance considerations.\n\nFor Enterprise and Financial Services: Java and C# provide the stability, security, and regulatory compliance frameworks that regulated industries require. Don’t chase trends when handling mission-critical systems.\n\nFor Performance-Critical Applications: Go for backend services, Rust for system programming, and C++ for real-time applications. Latency requirements should drive language selection, not popularity metrics.\n\nFor AI/ML Products: Python dominates, but consider Julia for scientific computing or R for statistical analysis. Language choice depends on your specific AI use case and team expertise.\n\nGiven 95% of tech leaders face challenges finding skilled workers, your approach to technical hiring needs to evolve beyond traditional methods.\n\nFocus on fundamental problem-solving over specific syntax knowledge. A strong engineer can learn new languages; analytical thinking and system design skills transfer across technologies.\n\nPrioritize hands-on experience with real-world projects over certification collections. Ask candidates to walk through architecture decisions they’ve made and trade-offs they’ve considered.\n\nEvaluate AI collaboration skills. The shift toward engineers with expertise in AI augmentation, system architecture, and cross-functional problem-solving means traditional coding assessments miss crucial competencies.\n\nIt’s easy enough for software engineers to become AI engineers: just build applications on top of LLMs. This accessibility is reshaping what skills remain uniquely human and valuable.\n\nLanguages that enhance AI productivity:\n\nThe programming languages your team learns should align with how AI tools augment rather than replace human developers. Focus on languages that excel in areas where human judgment and creativity remain irreplaceable: system architecture, user experience design, and complex business logic implementation.\n\nBottom Line: The most important programming language for your 2025 hiring strategy isn’t determined by popularity rankings—it’s the one that best matches your technical architecture, team experience, and business requirements. Technology hiring trends in 2025 indicate that candidates place high value on exposure to AI and machine learning projects, as these skills significantly enhance their career trajectories.\n\nThe companies succeeding in today’s competitive hiring market understand that language proficiency is just the foundation. The real competitive advantage comes from engineers who can architect systems, collaborate with AI tools, and adapt to evolving technical requirements.\n\nReady to build a hiring strategy that actually reflects today’s market realities? Let’s discuss how the current tech landscape impacts your specific technical requirements and talent acquisition approach.",

    "description": "This decision forces Terraform's users to migrate to HCL, drawing criticism from those who point to the CDK's popularity as proof Terraform still needs advanced programming capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Going forward, when you run IBM‘s Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software, you will have one language to write your configurations: the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).\n\nOn Monday, HashiCorp, an IBM company, announced that it will no longer support the Terraform Cloud Development Kit (CDK or CDKTF). Although the existing code will remain available in a GitHub archive, HashiCorp will no longer maintain or update the code, leaving it all but unusable for enterprises.\n\n“Unfortunately, Terraform CDK did not find product-market fit at scale. HashiCorp, an IBM Company, has chosen to focus its investments on Terraform core and its broader ecosystem,” a note on the site read.\n\nThe CDK itself is licensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL), so users are free to fork the software itself, IBM suggested.\n\nThe company, however, is encouraging users to use HCL, which was developed by HashiCorp and licensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL), originally designed for the software.\n\nOriginally released in 2014 by HashiCorp, Terraform is software that allows administrators to automate the deployment of IT infrastructure, either in the cloud or on premises, through the use of scripts and a set of Terraform commands such as terraform init, terraform plan and terraform apply. The output is rendered as JSON.\n\nOver time, Terraform has become the most popular software for automated IT deployment, especially in the cloud native community.\n\nIn 2023, HashiCorp switched the Terraform license from open source to a Business Source License, which spurred a user-based open source fork of the software, called OpenTofu, that was adopted by the Linux Foundation and, later, by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).\n\nIn 2024, IBM announced it was acquiring HashiCorp and finalized the purchase earlier this year.\n\nDespite a call to open source the CDK, IBM is encouraging current users to adopt the HCL if they are not already doing so.\n\n“If you are not using AWS CDK, we highly recommend migrating to standard Terraform and HCL for long-term support and ecosystem alignment,” the company asserted.\n\nTerraform users with .tf files created under the CDK can convert them to HCL with the following command:\n\nThose using CDTF on Amazon Web Services infrastructure can also use AWS’ own CDK.\n\nOverall, the Infrastructure as Code user base appears to be chafing from the limits of IaC.\n\nAs a result, many alternative approaches to Terraform have popped up in the last few years, including Adam Jacob’s System Initiative and Formae from Platform Engineering Labs.\n\nThey point to how HCL has its limits, especially for highly scalable environments. A declarative configuration language, HCL is limited in offering advanced programming constructs, and many resulting workarounds have resulted in obtuse code. Tooling is limited as well.\n\nThe advantage that the CDKTF brought to users was that it allowed them to detail deployment instructions through their own favorite programming language rather than HCL. CDKTF supported TypeScript, Python, C# and the Go programming language.\n\nThis is also the approach that Terraform competitor Pulumi has staked out, namely the ability to provision infrastructure in any one of a number of programming languages.\n\nYet, there has also been considerable debate around whether a general-purpose programming language is better than a domain-specific language. Terraform’s users are administrators, not programmers, as critics have pointed out.\n\nNonetheless, many of those in the IaC community took the news hard. Kubernetes expert David Flanagan noted that the development kit has gotten over 140,000 downloads per week for TypeScript alone, with similar numbers in other language communities.\n\nSo clearly, the CDKTF is still highly used by the community, he argued.\n\nFuck you, Hashicorp … an IBM Company. pic.twitter.com/h1EicnT3pL\n\n— David Flanagan (@rawkode), Dec. 11, 2025\n\n“You don’t kill a project with [an estimated] million users every single month because nobody likes it or it doesn’t have a ‘market fit.’ You kill it because it is not increasing your profit margin, it is not selling enterprise licenses,” Flanagan said in a short video.\n\nTo be fair, IBM has a long history of buying open source-based companies, and keeping the open source licensing intact, including the Linux-based Red Hat, the Cassandra-focused Datastax and, most recently, the Kafka-based Confluent. (There’s been no word, however, on whether IBM would revert the Terraform license back to open source.)\n\nFlanagan went on to note that people are probably using the CDKTF because they require the additional programming capabilities. “It’s called Infrastructure as Code, not Infrastructure as JSON,” he quipped.\n\nSite reliability engineer Liz Fong-Jones offered a more measured response.\n\n“To be more gentle about this, HashiCorp has decided to stop trying to compete with Pulumi with language-native APIs; they’re all in on HCL as the only way to work with Terraform,” Fong-Jones wrote on BlueSky.\n\nIn fact, others think this may not be a bad idea.\n\nPlatform Engineering Labs’ Co-Founder and CEO Pavlo Baron thought the IBM move made sense.\n\n“IBM is historically good at optimizing for the target buyer. This is rather a sign that nobody on the right side of the cycle wants to do full-blown programming. CDKs, and this includes the approach Pulumi takes, are exclusively for developers. Developers usually don’t operate infrastructure,” he wrote by email.\n\n“Serious operations happen on the right side of the cycle, though. Thus, the CDK is missing their target user and addresses the wrong one. So I understand and support the logic behind this move.”",

    "fullText": "Tries: Ambadiang, Zarantonello, Ardron, Vargas, Botitu Cons: Popelin 4\n\nA much-changed Edinburgh side shipped five tries in an Investec Champions Cup drubbing by Castres in the south of France.\n\nHead coach Sean Everitt made 11 changes from the side that started last weekend's impressive home victory against Toulon as he prioritised the forthcoming 1872 Cup derbies with Glasgow Warriors.\n\nAnd Edinburgh were unable to replicate that level of performance in their second match of the competition.\n\nThey had plenty possession and territory in the first half, but were ineffective in attack and went into half-time five points behind after Castres wing Christian Ambadiang dived over in the corner.\n\nLoris Zarantonello, Tyler Ardron, Adam Vargas and Vilimoni Botitu then crossed after the break in a dominant home display.\n\nEdinburgh hooker Ewan Ashman thought he had gone over under the posts for a late consolation, but the try was ruled out for a knock-on earlier in the move as the visitors failed to score a single point.\n\nBoth teams have won one and lost one in their opening two matches in Pool 2.\n\n'Statement' Toulouse win 'means the world' to Glasgow\n\nGlasgow mount incredible comeback to stun Toulouse\n\nThe much-changed Edinburgh outfit never got going, but the nature in which the conceded the first try will frustrate Everitt.\n\nCammy Scott launched a kick dead, gifting possession back to the French side and soon after, Matt Currie knocked on under no pressure in his own 22.\n\nFrom the resulting scrum, Ambadiang stepped past one defender and found his way to the whitewash.\n\nEdinburgh could have been ahead at that point. They'd crossed the whitewash through Piers O'Conor, only for the centre to be held up, and had thrown the ball away when there was an opportunity to score out wide.\n\nOnly 5-0 down, Everitt would have felt his side had a chance but the second-half was about as one-sided as it gets.\n\nConstantly camped in their own half, Edinburgh succumbed to wave after wave of Castres attack.\n\nIt took seven minutes for the hosts to score, as hooker Zarantonello crashed over at the back of the maul.\n\nFive minutes later, Edinburgh gifted Castres their third when substitute Ewan Ashman launched a throw over his jumper on his own 5m line, with Tyler Ardron gleefully crossing.\n\nO'Conor was then sent to the bin for a high tackle and Castres inflicted further punishment, scoring quick tries through Vargas and player of the match Botitu while Edinburgh were down to 14 men.\n\nAshman's try being ruled out was only further salt in the wound on a bruising day for Edinburgh, but they will hope to welcome plenty key men back for the upcoming 1872 Cup double header.\n\nCastres: Palis, Ambadiang, Bottin, Goodhue, Vargas; Popelin, Fernandez; Walcker, Zarantonello, Azar, Maravat, Staniforth, Delaporte (c), Ardron, Papalii.\n\nReplacements: Durand-Pradere, Guerois-Galisson, Corato, Nakarawa, Cope, Doubrere, Herve, Karawalevu.\n\nEdinburgh: Brown, McCann, M Currie, O'Conor, Wells, Scott, Vellacott (c); Venter, Morris, O Blyth-Lafferty, Hunter-Hill, Young, McConnell, Douglas, Dodd.\n\nReplacements: Ashman, Jones, Hill, Boyle, Watson, Shiel, Lang, Goosen.",

Former Harlequins prop Kyle Sinckler powered towards the posts before being hauled down, Toulon moved the ball wide and Juan Ignacio Brex strolled over.\n\nToulon thought they had scored again in the final action of the first half, but Bath held the ball up to keep the deficit to five points.\n\nGarcia kicked another penalty as the hosts started to dominate up front in the second half but Bath dug deep to keep in touch.\n\nScrum-half Tom Carr-Smith, making his first European start in place of captain Ben Spencer, was involved as Santiago Carreras dived over for the visitors' second try.\n\nRussell's conversion closed the gap to one point but back came Toulon. Sinckler again played a prominent role with a surging run and Toulon worked the ball to the rapid Drean, who restored the home side's eight-point cushion.\n\nBath turned to their bench and replacement Arthur Green grounded the ball from close range to cut the deficit.\n\nBut Ludlam buried over for Toulon's bonus-point try from a five-metre scrum, and Garcia's steely conversion from the touchline extended their lead to eight points once again.\n\nHennessey's try showed Bath's resilience but a Toulon maul proved to be unstoppable as the hosts sealed victory.\n\nBath face Castres away in their third Champions Cup pool match on 9 January before hosting Edinburgh in their final game on 16 January.\n\nToulon will be at home to Munster before travelling to Gloucester.\n\nPrem leaders Bath return to domestic action at Newcastle Red Bulls next Sunday, while Toulon face a tough trip to Champions Cup holders Bordeaux in the Top 14 on the same day.\n\nFive-try Castres cruise past rotated Edinburgh\n\nHendy hat-trick as eight-try Saints hammer Bulls\n\nHarlequins score 10 tries in thrashing of Bayonne\n\nToulon: Ferte; Drean, Brex, Sinzelle, Tuicuvu; Garcia, Serin; Gros, Lucchesi, Sinckler, Rebbadj, Alainu'uese, Ludlam, Ollivon, Mercer.\n\nReplacements: Baubigny, Ametlla, Priso, Mezou, Abadie, White, Smaili, Karaba.\n\nBath: Carreras; Cokanasiga, Ojomoh, Redpath, Arundell; Russell Carr-Smith; Obano, Dunn, Sela, Roux, Molony, Hill, Underhill, Barbeary.\n\nReplacements: Tuipulotu, Van Wyk, Du Toit, Richards, Reid, Le Roux, Hennessey, Green.\n\nReferee: Nika Amashukeli (Georgia)\n\nAssistant referees: Saba Abulashvili (Georgia) and Saba Makharadze (Georgia)",

Tshakweni was adamant he had been reacting to a trip momentarily before by Iyogun but the contact from the Saints replacement prop was ruled accidental when looked at by the officials.\n\nSaints seized the opportunity of having the extra man to secure the bonus point through Pollock before Alex Coles and Sleightholme crossed as the hosts registered three tries in five minutes.\n\nHendy wrapped up his hat-trick with 12 minutes remaining and Josh Kemeny strolled in for the eighth try of an excellent afternoon for Saints in the final minute.\n\nThe top two teams in the pool meet in a rerun of last year's final when the Investec Champions Cup returns in January as Saints head to Bordeaux. Northampton then round off the pool stage with a home game against Scarlets on 18 January.\n\nThe Bulls, who have one point from two matches, host Bristol next before before an away trip to Pau.\n\nNorthampton: Furbank; Sleightholme, Hutchinson, Dingwall, Hendy; F Smith, Mitchell; Fischetti, Wright, Davison, Coles, Van der Mescht, Kemeny, Pearson, Pollock\n\nReplacements: R Smith, Iyogun, Kundiona, Munga, Prowse, Graham, James, Thame\n\nBulls: Williams; Petersen, Gans, Vorster, Jacobs; Wolhuter, Burger; Tshakweni, Van der Merwe, Smith, Wiese, Van Heerden, Coetzee, Ludwig, Louw\n\nReplacements: Else, Sithole, Mchunu, Gumede, Carr, Papier, Johannes, Van Niekerk\n\nAssistant referees: Rob McDowell (Sco) and Dave Sutherland (Sco)",

    "description": "It could come at a huge cost to many retirees.",
    "fullText": "Like much of the developed world, Germany is facing an aging population that is making its national pension system unsustainable.\n\nTo fix the problem, a panel of economic experts has floated a controversial idea: raise the retirement age to 73 by the year 2060, up from the current age of 65, according to the Telegraph. (1)\n\nGermany isn’t the only country considering this drastic move. Denmark is set to raise its retirement age to 70 by 2040 (2) while France raised its retirement age from 62 to 64 in 2023 despite public backlash. (3)\n\nSimilar proposals have been floated in the U.S., though their legitimacy is unclear. When asked in September if a retirement age hike could be on the horizon, Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano said “everything’s being considered.” (4) However, that comment was later withdrawn. (5)\n\nWhile a higher retirement age could one day be on the horizon for millions of American workers, it’s not a silver bullet for the Social Security system’s funding challenges, and could come at a huge cost to many retirees.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), proponents of raising the retirement age point to the Social Security trust fund’s imminent depletion and rising life expectancy as key reasons for the move. (6)\n\nThe underlying trust funds are on track to be depleted by late 2032, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (7), which could result in a 24% benefit cut across the board or the equivalent of a $18,100 cut for a couple retiring at the start of 2033.\n\nMeanwhile, life expectancy at birth has jumped from 73.7 in 1980 to 78.4 as of 2023, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. (8)\n\nRaising the retirement age could reduce the amount of benefits paid out from the Social Security trust fund and be \n\nHowever, opponents argue raising the retirement age is a de-facto benefit cut for all workers and is particularly negative for vulnerable workers. A retiree turning 62 in 2034 could lose a total of $100,000 in total benefit payments if the retirement age is raised to 69, according to Senator Elizabeth Warren. Similarly, the CPBB found that the average lifetime benefit cut would be nearly 20% if the retirement age is lifted to 70.",

    "title": "The Bay Area neighborhood most vulnerable to sea level rise is also sinking: ‘A right now problem'",
    "description": "Thousands of people in a major Bay Area city already face periodic flooding. It's projected to get much worse.",
    "fullText": "During high-water events like last week's king tide, Marin County's densest neighborhood begins to drown.\n\nNear the harbor, saltwater trickles out from under an apartment building and swamps a restaurant patio, finding cracks in foundations and cement walls put up to staunch it. It inches up the tires of parked cars and pools over evacuation routes. Multistory buildings loom like islands.\n\nThis San Rafael neighborhood, home to 12,000 people, is the Bay Area's most vulnerable to sea level rise, for a multitude of reasons. It perches over a canal leading to the San Francisco Bay, and parts of it were originally built on soil added to fill in the wetlands and bay itself - a topography that is causing it to sink even as the ocean and bay rise. Even in the immediate term, a large earthquake or a huge, 100-year storm combined with a high tide could create inundation by several feet, experts say.\n\n\"People aren't necessarily aware that this is happening and the risks that are present,\" said Rita Mazariegos, a member of a community sea level rise steering committee, who spoke in Spanish through an interpreter. She said displacement is a constant worry. \"There is not enough affordable housing here, and so the moment (a flood) happens, it's a grave situation for everyone that lives here.\"\n\nThe area of San Rafael, called the Canal District, is the Bay Area's densest neighborhood after Chinatown. It is also the most segregated: Predominantly Latino and working-class, it is one of  Marin's few low-income areas. Most of the land and buildings along the channel are privately owned, leaving no room to build seawalls or levees to defend against both emergency floods and the long-term threat of climate change.\n\n\"All these adaptation options would involve putting something between the bay and the urban area. But right now that's not possible,\" said Kate Hagemann, climate adaptation and resilience planner for the city of San Rafael.\n\nOne immediate problem is that the neighborhood's two main exit roads are lower than the highest tide. Already prone to tidal flooding, they are expected to become permanently inundated by 2050, according to the Transportation Authority of Marin's recent sea level rise study, which suggested elevating the roadways.\n\nConsultants published a draft feasibility study in October for the city with alternative options to consider for protecting the shoreline and surrounding neighborhood. One alternative would involve the government purchasing up to 86 of the more than 100 private properties that line the shoreline, or at least buying easements on them, in order to build shoreline protection, and then selling the land back to private developers. That route could take at least two decades to complete, at a cost of $211 million for the property acquisitions, the study found.\n\n\"All of that is seven steps in the future,\" said Hagemann, who previously had a similar role in Miami-Dade County. San Rafael is exploring the options while asking the community for feedback, she said. \"By no means is a choice being made at the moment.\"\n\nThe study also presents ideas for immediate fixes, such as raising areas along the canal above the current highest tide and upgrading pump stations that are already overwhelmed at high tides - and only designed to deal with rainwater, not seawater. Along with other long-term strategies like building levees, the adaptations could cost an estimated $719 million to $1.9 billion. The city would likely need to bring in outside funding and would be responsible for at least 35% of any project that received federal support, according to the study.\n\nSuch fixes can't come soon enough, community members say, because flooding is already a chronic problem. Mazariegos' husband lost his car to floodwaters two decades ago. Raquel Sanchez, who lived in the Canal District for 20 years, said water filled parking areas during rainstorms, dampening her car's interior. Moisture seeped into the house she shared with her sons, blooming into mold on the walls and infusing her clothes with mildew.\n\n\"When I changed to a different building I thought it would be better. It had the same problem,\" said Sanchez, who moved three times within the neighborhood and has since relocated just outside of it.\n\nIn addition to being the home of mostly working class residents, thousands of people have jobs in the neighborhood at places like a wastewater treatment plant and recycling center, which are also vulnerable, said Hagemann.\n\n\"The scale is really large,\" said Isabel French, director of marketing and communications at Canal Alliance, a nonprofit offering legal and other services to Latino immigrants. \"And it's not a future problem, it's a right now problem.\"\n\nThe Bay Conservation and Development Commission, the state agency that oversees sea level rise planning in the San Francisco Bay, found that San Rafael has the highest proportion of people at risk of flooding from early sea level rise impacts, compared to 30 other areas around the region, in a 2020 vulnerability study.\n\n\"In most places around the bay there's maybe 20 years to patch cracks in the bathtub,\" said Kristina Hill, a professor at UC Berkeley's Department of Landscape Architecture & Environmental Planning, referring to the vulnerability of the shoreline as sea levels rise. \"In San Rafael, the bathtub is already really cracked. They maybe have 10 years to really patch the cracks.\"\n\nAccording to the city, parts of eastern San Rafael have sunk by several feet in areas built over fill, and some areas are expected to subside 2 to 4 more feet in coming decades. Like many parts of the Bay Area, much of it was built on bay mud soil or areas where construction waste or other material was used to fill former wetlands and parts of the bay.\n\nSea levels have risen 3 inches in the past 25 years and are expected to rise another foot in the coming 25 to 45 years. That is considered a tipping point when, if nothing is done, economic losses could reach $130 million to $210 million, according to the feasibility study. By that point, the canal would overtop barriers once a month, which would \"disrupt regular function\" in the area, \"through regular flooding of vehicles, salt corrosion of infrastructure, business disruption, market perception of risk and potential collapse in real estate values,\" the study said.\n\n\"We're going to be living in this time of incremental flooding events that get worse and worse and worse. They'll seem like small disasters but eventually the water won't go away,\" said Hill, whose graduate students just finished a class devoted to finding solutions for both short- and long-term flood risk in the Canal District, including from an earthquake, which they found could lead to flooding during a high tide by disabling pumps and knocking over informal barriers.\n\nHill was encouraged by the city and county's purchase of 1.6 acres in the neighborhood last month to build a much-needed park: They spent  $3.35 million with the help of private partners like the Canal Alliance. The city will explore the idea of building a pedestrian bridge from the park to connect the neighborhood better to other parts of the city.\n\nHills' students envisioned using the new space, and other existing parks, as emergency hubs, with storage for tents and other supplies, she said.\n\nIf  roads were elevated, they could later be transformed into levees, Hill's students suggest, when more protection is needed from rising seas.\n\nThe city and county must build more low-income housing for the region's workforce in a less vulnerable area, Hill said, but the Canal District does not have to be abandoned. Buildings in the flood zone can be redesigned to be floodproof on the first floor, as is done in Humboldt County, or to float, as in the Netherlands, she said.\n\nBut Marin County has many other places to protect along its bayshore, said Michael Wara, the director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University and a Marin County resident.\n\n\"The only solutions are going to involve really intensive engineering,\" he said. \"There's going to be places where Marin has the money to defend and places where it's not going to be able to defend.\"\n\nThe Canal District lies within the jurisdiction of San Rafael, so the city is responsible for raising funding, but the county can advocate for it when it applies for state and federal funding - though the latter has been scarce lately, which is making getting state funding more competitive, said Talia Smith, interim deputy county executive.\n\nThe county is working on creating a more unified approach to the problem for the eight jurisdictions that lie along the county's bayshore, including unincorporated areas - similar to the organization called OneShoreline in San Mateo County, Smith said.\n\nThat way, she said, \"We don't have the county competing with San Rafael.\"\n\nThis article originally published at The Bay Area neighborhood most vulnerable to sea level rise is also sinking: ‘A right now problem'.",

James Austin Johnson‘s Trump, addled by Ambien and Adderall, expounded on Caribbean boat strikes and found the time to lash out at CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.\n\nThe proud Trump of “SNL” showed off his latest airstrike video, an obvious attack on Santa’s sleigh, to the horror of the gathered reporters.\n\n“Was that Santa?” a confused reporter asked.\n\nThe faux-Trump repeatedly waxed poetic about White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt‘s lips, a detail that feels like “SNL” laying it on thick that is actually ripped from the headlines.\n\n“Look at those lips. They go bop-bop-bop like a machine gun, just spectacular. I’m a married man. I’m obsessed with this woman,” he said. “She liked it because I’m very nice to women.”\n\nJust then, the sketch’s Trump noticed that Collins had a question.\n\n“You have a question, you nasty, horrible witch?” he said.\n\n“That’s actually one of the nicest things you’ve called me,” she replied.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\n\nThe actual Trump has turned attacking the reporters who follow him a near-daily routine, but he’s been particularly vicious to CNN anchor Collins.\n\n“Caitlin Collin’s of Fake News CNN, always Stupid and Nasty, asked me why the new Ballroom was costing more money than originally thought one year ago,” he wrote on Truth Social earlier this month. “FAKE NEWS CNN, and the guy who runs the whole corrupt operation that owns it, is one of the worst in the business. Their ratings are so low that they’re not even counted or relevant anymore.”\n\nCollins responded to the dig on Instagram, noting that she didn’t actually ask Trump about his massive and costly ballroom.\n\n“Technically, my question was about Venezuela,” she said.\n\nWatch the skit below via YouTube:\n\nThe post “You nasty, horrible witch”: Trump attacks Kaitlan Collins, strikes Santa’s sleigh on “SNL” appeared first on Salon.com.",

It also wounded three members of the Syrian security forces who clashed with the gunman, interior ministry spokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba said.\n\nAl-Baba said that Syria’s new authorities had faced shortages in security personnel and had to recruit rapidly after the unexpected success of a rebel offensive last year that intended to capture the northern city of Aleppo but ended up overthrowing the government of former President Bashar Assad.\n\n“We were shocked that in 11 days we took all of Syria and that put a huge responsibility in front of us from the security and administration sides,” he said.\n\nThe attacker was among 5,000 members who recently joined a new division in the internal security forces formed in the desert region known as the Badiya, one of the places where remnants of the Islamic State extremist group have remained active.\n\nAl-Baba said the internal security forces’ leadership had recently become suspicious that there was an infiltrator leaking information to IS and began evaluating all members in the Badiya area.\n\nThe probe raised suspicions last week about the man who later carried out the attack, but officials decided to continue monitoring him for a few days to try to determine if he was an active member of IS and to identify the network he was communicating with if so, al-Baba said. He did not name the attacker.\n\nAt the same time, as a “precautionary measure,” he said, the man was reassigned to guard equipment at the base at a location where he would be farther from the leadership and from any patrols by U.S.-led coalition forces.\n\nOn Saturday, the man stormed a meeting between U.S. and Syrian security officials who were having lunch together and opened fire after clashing with Syrian guards, al-Baba said. The attacker was shot and killed at the scene.\n\nAl-Baba acknowledged that the incident was “a major security breach” but said that in the year since Assad’s fall “there have been many more successes than failures” by security forces.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting, he said, the Syrian army and internal security forces “launched wide-ranging sweeps of the Badiya region” and broke up a number of alleged IS cells.\n\nThe incident comes at a delicate time as the U.S. military is expanding its cooperation with Syrian security forces.\n\nThe U.S. has had forces on the ground in Syria for over a decade, with a stated mission of fighting IS, with about 900 troops present there today.\n\nBefore Assad’s ouster, Washington had no diplomatic relations with Damascus and the U.S. military did not work directly with the Syrian army. Its main partner at the time was the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country’s northeast.\n\nThat has changed over the past year. Ties have warmed between the administrations of U.S. President Donald Trump and Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, the former leader of an Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that used to be listed by Washington as a terrorist organization.\n\nIn November, al-Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit Washington since the country’s independence in 1946. During his visit, Syria announced its entry into the global coalition against the Islamic State, joining 89 other countries that have committed to combating the group.\n\nU.S. officials have vowed retaliation against IS for the attack but have not publicly commented on the fact that the shooter was a member of the Syrian security forces.\n\nCritics of the new Syrian authorities have pointed to Saturday’s attack as evidence that the security forces are deeply infiltrated by IS and are an unreliable partner.\n\nMouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, an advocacy group that seeks to build closer relations between Washington and Damascus, said that is unfair.\n\nDespite both having Islamist roots, HTS and IS were enemies and often clashed over the past decade.\n\nAmong former members of HTS and allied groups, Moustafa, said, “It’s a fact that even those who carry the most fundamentalist of beliefs, the most conservative within the fighters, have a vehement hatred of ISIS.”\n\n“The coalition between the United States and Syria is the most important partnership in the global fight against ISIS because only Syria has the expertise and experience to deal with this,” he said.",

    "description": "The new Bluey game is the first made in Australia, the first to involve creator Joe Brumm and the first to respect the kids playing...",
    "fullText": "The new Bluey game is the first made in Australia, the first to involve creator Joe Brumm and the first to respect the kids playing it\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nBluey embodies the talent, heart and character of Australia’s creative industries. But unfortunately, until now, the beloved franchise’s video games had a track record spottier than her friend Chloe the dalmatian.\n\nSome parents treated Budge Studios’ 2023 mobile game Bluey: Let’s Play! with caution, with its $9.99 monthly subscription and persistent adverts for Budge’s other licensed games. Later that same year, Artax Games’ Bluey: The Videogame was widely criticised on release for its barely two-hour run time, technical problems and $60 price tag. In his review, Australian game critic Luke Plunkett called it: “a slapdash cash grab that does the bare minimum.”\n\nAnd released in August this year, StoryToys’s mobile game Lego Bluey offers block-building, minigames and another subscription – this one cheaper and less aggressively advertised. All three games were commissioned by BBC Studios, which co-commissions the show with ABC and handles all of Bluey’s international merchandising and licensing.\n\nBut Bluey’s Quest for the Gold Pen is the first to live up to the standards that made Bluey one of the most-watched shows in the world. Also commissioned by BBC Studios, it was made in Brisbane by Bluey creator Joe Brumm and Halfbrick Studios of Fruit Ninja fame, making it the first Bluey game made in Australia, the first to involve Bluey’s creator, and the last original Bluey story we’re likely to get from Brumm until the 2027 movie.\n\nAfter playing the opening levels of Halfbrick’s take on Bluey, I can say it feels like an actual game; the studio has said it should take about 10 hours to complete, which feels accurate. It is essentially a classic adventure game in which Bluey and Bingo chase their impish dad Bandit through a series of magical artworks after he pinches their pen. The game’s design rewards curiosity, exploration and the liberal use of Bluey’s magic wand. Meanwhile, Brumm’s script gets Chilli and Bandit debating how to avoid lawnmower parenting while they concoct the game’s next level.\n\nHalfbrick Studio’s CEO, Shainiel Deo, was always a strong contender to win Bluey’s video game rights. Hundreds of millions around the world have played Halfbrick games, and he and Brumm have been friends since they worked on the game for Brumm’s Dan the Man series in 2016.\n\nWhen Brumm suggested Deo should pitch BBC Studios, other Bluey games were already under way. “It definitely should have gone to an Australian developer first,” says Deo; still, he understands why the BBC went with developers they had worked with before.\n\nFrom the start, doing Bluey proud was Halfbrick’s primary concern. “This game will be ready when it’s ready,” Deo remembers telling BBC decision makers. “We took on all the risks in terms of funding it, that was on our coin, but I wanted to make a great experience.”\n\nDeo insisted on an uncertain timeline to allow for exploration and prototyping. Despite footing the bill for delays, Deo feels the process worked thanks to a team driven by passion for their homegrown hero Bluey, and a deep connection to the Heelers’ contemporary Brisbane lifestyle. “They take a lot of pride in being the first Australian team to work on a Bluey game,” he says.\n\nIt is another win for the Australian games industry after Adelaide-made Hollow Knight: Silksong’s immense popularity crashed global storefronts in September. Aussie developers, still suffering layoffs, have deserved better when it comes to landing their biggest homegrown licences. To date, no Australian developer has released a Mad Max game; even a frankly inexplicable Neighbours racing game was made in the UK.\n\nFellow Australian developer Jason Imms says while the BBC owed nothing to Australia, taking advantage of the local talent that birthed Bluey was “a no-brainer”.\n\nImms, the head of quality assurance at Keywords Studios, says he’s pleased a respected Queensland developer like Halfbrick got a go. “We have so few homegrown franchises, and we have so few opportunities to play with Australian IP in games. Bluey is such a special thing, with such broad reach. It speaks to an Australiana that other Australian media really hasn’t been able to deliver to the rest of the world.”\n\nJoey Egger, head of games at Screen Australia, which co-funds Bluey the show but not the games, is delighted Halfbrick got to showcase Bluey’s “unique Australian-ness”. “It’s so daggy. It’s got all the nuances; it’s very Brisbane,” says Egger of the show. “It’s something you can only truly replicate and extend into the games world if you really understand those nuances.”\n\nWorking on beloved homegrown franchises is an “immense source of pride” for developers, says Egger, who previously produced Wiggles games. “Today’s youth don’t think just TV, just movies, just games,” she adds. “They find an IP that they love and adore, and they will consume it on any platform.”\n\nThe quality of a Bluey game isn’t just a matter of national pride. Children can be treated as easily fooled customers who will play anything or as gullible marks for manipulative, lucrative business models.\n\nHalfbrick Studios has made both “freemium” games (free with ads, with a one-time payment for an ad-free version) and subscription games. Neither model seemed appropriate for Bluey’s young audiences, so Deo returned to the one-time-purchase “premium” model the studio used in the 2000s, before mobile games exploded. “We don’t want to put people on a treadmill where they have to keep grinding to get stuff or pay,” he says. “Ethics is important for me.”\n\nImms, who says his kids quickly tired of Bluey: The Videogame, feels developers owe kids more, not less, than adult gamers. “Do kids deserve better? Of course they do. You could argue they need it more than we do because they’re still growing; they’re still shaping their understanding of the world. Stories that teach them about kindness and care, love and hardship – all those good things that Bluey teaches – are going to be beneficial for them.”\n\nBluey’s Quest for the Gold Pen is out now on iOS, Android on 10 January 2026, and PC and consoles later in 2026.",

    "fullText": "LUXOR, Egypt (AP) — Egypt on Sunday revealed the revamp of two colossal statues of a prominent pharaoh in the southern city of Luxor, the latest in the government’s archaeological events that aim at drawing more tourists to the country.\n\nThe giant alabaster statues, known as the Colossi of Memnon, were reassembled in a renovation project that lasted about two decades. They represent Amenhotep III, who ruled ancient Egypt about 3,400 years ago.\n\n“Today we are celebrating, actually, the finishing and the erecting of these two colossal statues,” Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told The Associated Press ahead of the ceremony.\n\nAttempts to revive a prestigious temple\n\nIsmail said the colossi are of great significance to Luxor, a city known for its ancient temples and other antiquities. They’re also an attempt to “revive how this funerary temple of king Amenhotep III looked like a long time ago,” Ismail said.\n\nAmenhotep III, one of the most prominent pharaohs, ruled during the 500 years of the New Kingdom, which was the most prosperous time for ancient Egypt. The pharaoh, whose mummy is showcased at a Cairo museum, ruled between 1390–1353 BC, a peaceful period known for its prosperity and great construction, including his mortuary temple, where the Colossi of Memnon are located, and another temple, Soleb, in Nubia.\n\nThe colossi were toppled by a strong earthquake in about 1200 BC that also destroyed Amenhotep III’s funerary temple, said Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.\n\nThey were fragmented and partly quarried away, with their pedestals dispersed. Some of their blocks were reused in the Karnak temple, but archaeologists brought them back to rebuild the colossi, according to the Antiquities Ministry.\n\nIn late 1990s, an Egyptian German mission, chaired by German Egyptologist Hourig Sourouzian, began working in the temple area, including the assembly and renovation of the colossi.\n\n“This project has in mind … to save the last remains of a once-prestigious temple,” she said.\n\nA Pharoah facing the rising sun\n\nThe statues show Amenhotep III seated with hands resting on his thighs, with their faces looking eastward toward the Nile and the rising sun. They wear the nemes headdress surmounted by the double crowns and the pleated royal kilt, which symbolizes the pharaoh’s divine rule.\n\nTwo other small statues on the pharaoh’s feet depict his wife, Tiye.\n\nThe colossi — 14.5 meters (48 feet) and 13.6 meters (45 feet) respectively — preside over the entrance of the king’s temple on the western bank of the Nile. The 35-hectare (86-acre) complex is believed to be the largest and richest temple in Egypt and is usually compared to the temple of Karnak, also in Luxor.\n\nThe colossi were hewn in Egyptian alabaster from the quarries of Hatnub, in Middle Egypt. They were fixed on large pedestals with inscriptions showing the name of the temple, as well as the quarry.\n\nUnlike other monumental sculptures of ancient Egypt, the colossi were partly compiled with pieces sculpted separately, which were fixed into each statue’s main monolithic alabaster core, the ministry said.\n\nSunday’s unveiling in Luxor came just six weeks after the inauguration of the long-delayed Grand Egyptian Museum, the centerpiece of the government’s bid to boost the country’s tourism industry and bring cash into the troubled economy. The mega project is located near the famed Giza Pyramids and the Sphinx.\n\nThe tourism sector, which depends heavily on Egypt’s rich pharaonic artifacts, has suffered during years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover after the coronavirus pandemic and amid Russia’s war on Ukraine — both countries are major sources of tourists visiting Egypt.\n\n“This site is going to be a point of interest for years to come,” said Tourism and Antiquities Minister Sherif Fathy, who attended the unveiling ceremony. “There are always new things happening in Luxor.”\n\nA record number of about 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt in 2024, contributing about 8% of the country’s GDP, according to official figures.\n\nFathy, the minister,has said about 18 million tourists are expected to visit the country this year, with authorities hoping for 30 million visitors annually by 2032.",

    "description": "2026 should kick off a long-term process of housing market normalization, with small improvements in affordability.",
    "fullText": "For more than three years, it’s been dismal to be a homebuyer. But in 2026, things might get just a little easier.\n\nHousing affordability is poised to improve next year as mortgage rates decrease slightly and home price appreciation slows down. Those conditions — provided they hold — could bring more buyers and sellers off the sidelines and into the market during the traditional busy spring homebuying season, and help home sales notch their first significant gain since they plunged in 2023 to levels not seen since the mid-1990s.\n\nUltimately, affordability improvements next year are likely to be the first step in a longer period of market normalization, economists and experts who spoke to Yahoo Finance say. Given just how aggressively prices and mortgage rates have risen in recent years, many buyers will remain shut out of the market.\n\n“It’s really only the start of a long process,” said Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the brokerage Redfin. “For a lot of people, they’re still not necessarily going to be able to get into the housing market.”\n\nWhen many people think of scenarios that would make homes more affordable, what often comes to mind is events like the global financial crisis, which sent US home prices down an average of 27% between 2006 and 2012.\n\nWhile it’s possible that home prices fall slightly on average next year, few housing experts expect a crash because the country still has a shortage of homes.\n\nInstead, most affordability gains will likely come via slightly lower mortgage rates and a pace of home price appreciation that drops below average wage growth.\n\nMany economists forecast only modest home price gains of 1% to 3% next year. That gives incomes, which have been rising in the 3% to 4% range annually, a chance at outpacing home price appreciation for the first time in years. Home prices are also falling in some markets, particularly in parts of the Southeast and the Mountain West.\n\nLower mortgage rates would also help affordability, and are a real possibility. Rates have been hovering around 6.2% in recent months, and many economists expect them to average somewhere in the low 6% range next year. That’s down from this year’s average of about 6.6%.\n\n“Across the year, there will be an improvement,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. “We expect monthly payments to be a little bit lower for the first time in five years.”\n\nEven relatively small drops in mortgage rates can translate to meaningful changes in monthly payments. A homeowner with a $320,000 mortgage at 6.8% — where rates were at the beginning of the year — would pay about $2,086 toward their loan each month. At 6.2% — where rates are now — they’d pay $1,960.",

    "fullText": "V3 engines are about as rare as unicorns, having made only sporadic appearances through motorcycling history. The first known example of such a layout, with two cylinders in one bank of the V and a single on the other, was created by German motorcycle manufacturer DKW in 1955 to power their two-stroke grand prix race bikes.\n\nSuzuki dabbled in this configuration in the late ‘60s for a 50cc race bike that never saw the light of day due to regulation changes, after which V3 engines surfaced again only in the ‘80s, powering Honda’s 500cc two-stroke grand prix race machines from 1982 to 1984, as well as 250cc and 400cc road-going two-stroke models up to 1987. The compact V3 engine configuration then faded into obscurity and was replaced in subsequent decades by the extremely popular inline four and V4 layouts. Well, the elusive V3 is now all set to make a 21st-century return.\n\nAt last year’s EICMA, the annual Milan Motorcycle Show, Honda surprised us all with their latest innovation — a modern 75-degree V3 engine, equipped with forced induction. The engine was presented mounted within a steel trellis frame with an inverted fork up front, single-sided swingarm at the rear, and 17-inch alloy wheels shod with Pirelli tyres, all of which signalled sporty intentions for this platform. This year, the Japanese manufacturer has taken things a step further by presenting the camouflaged V3R 900 E-Compressor Prototype, indicating that a production version is closer than we initially thought.\n\nAll previous V3 engines through history have been two-stroke. Honda’s latest creation is a liquid-cooled four-stroke, with a 75-degree angle between cylinder banks and a claimed capacity of 900cc. But what really stands out is the incorporation of forced induction, something rarely seen on motorcycles.\n\nWhile the 1980s saw all the big four Japanese manufacturers create turbocharged bikes, this trend was short-lived, killed off by unpredictable power delivery due to lag, weight, complexity, and cost. The only mainstream forced induction motorcycles in the modern era are Kawasaki’s H2 series of supercharged inline-four machines. Honda is now looking to change this with their V3 creation that casts aside turbocharging and supercharging, and instead takes a novel approach to forced induction — an electronically-controlled compressor mounted atop the forward bank of cylinders feeding the airbox.\n\nHonda’s system allows boost pressures to be controlled independently of engine speed or exhaust gas velocity, meaning that the engine can deliver high torque even from low rpm. The ECU can instruct the compressor to spin up and help the engine produce the power being demanded by the rider’s right wrist at a moment’s notice, eliminating the lag associated with turbos and the parasitic losses of a supercharger, while saving a great deal of weight in the process. The whole motor is extremely well packaged and slim, and Honda claims that this compact 900cc three-cylinder motor will make as much power as a conventional naturally-aspirated 1,200cc motor, which we imagine to be in the region of 200 horsepower.\n\nHonda has always been at the forefront of motorcycle engine innovation. They created the howling inline-six-cylinder CBX 1000, the oval-piston 32-valve V4 in the NR500 and NR750, and the highest revving production motorcycle engine ever — the little inline-four in the CBR250RR that screamed to 20,000 rpm. With most manufacturers today focused on building small, economical twins and developing EV technology, it seemed that the days of innovation in the internal combustion space were behind us, but here comes Honda to the rescue with something that the world hasn’t seen before. We can’t wait to see what they come up with next.",

    "fullText": "Is there nothing he can’t do? President Donald Trump has astounded viewers of the 126th Army-Navy football game with his unique approach to flipping a coin.\n\nWhile officiating the customary coin toss at the historic football clash at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, Trump demonstrated a bizarre heaving motion that resulted in almost no actual flipping of the coin itself.\n\nTaking the coin with a pinched left hand, and placing it into the open palm of his right, the president heaved the coin forward, sending it in a feeble, plunging arc. Helpfully, he pointed out where the coin had landed after it hit the ground.\n\nViewers immediately expressed their surprise at this pioneering method of coin-based decision-making.\n\n“Donald Trump may have executed the single worst coin flip in history,” wrote former independent congressional candidate Hal Stewart. “That coin is headed to the hall of shame!”\n\n“President Trump with the unprecedented coin toss that doesn’t appear to flip at all,” wrote author and radio host Clay Travis.\n\n“Donald Trump flips a coin like a pansy,” added political commentator Ed Krassenstein.\n\nHowever, the shock and surprise may be unwarranted as Trump has form in this area. In fact, as he has previously demonstrated, the president appears to believe that this is exactly how coins are flipped.\n\nIn 2018, Trump demonstrated his idiosyncratic style at that year’s Army-Navy Game, drawing critical fire from then-MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\n“Why is everything with this president so weird and so awkward?” Hayes asked. “Flipping a coin is not some great feat of athletics.”\n\n“To flip a coin, you just have to, uh, flip the coin. You use the thumb, you flick it into the air, get a good rotation going, let it land on the ground, see if it’s heads or tails.”\n\nThe All In host described Trump’s efforts as how one might release a baby bird into the air.\n\nThe Army Black Knights correctly called the coin in Saturday’s game tails. That did not, however, help them win, as the Navy Shipmen beat them in a close 17-16 game.",

Jasmine Crockett entered the Texas U.S. Senate race this week. Since her election to the House of Representatives in 2022, Crockett has built a national profile off viral confrontations with MAGA figures like President Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Crockett has already made clear she isn’t going to twist herself into a pretzel to try to win over previous Trump voters at the margins. She hopes to build bridges to new voters, arguing she can run as a progressive and outperform Beto O’Rourke, who fell just short of victory in his 2018 Senate bid. While that approach has earned her enthusiastic support with parts of the Democratic base, it has also left others questioning whether she can compete in a Republican-leaning state like Texas. This skepticism surrounding Crockett’s campaign rests on the same risk-minimizing logic that Texas Democrats have relied on for decades—a logic that has produced zero statewide victories since 1994.

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia as he held talks with U.S. envoys on ending the war.\n\nZelenskyy sat down with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. The Ukrainian leader posted pictures of the negotiating table with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sitting next to him facing the U.S. delegation.\n\nResponding to journalists’ questions in audio clips on a WhatsApp group chat before the talks, Zelenskyy said that since the U.S. and some European nations had rejected Ukraine’s push to join NATO, Kyiv expects the West to offer a set of guarantees similar to those offered to the alliance members.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he said. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has cast Ukraine's bid to join NATO as a major threat to Moscow's security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded tha Ukraine renounce the bid for the alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nZelenskyy emphasized that any security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress, adding that he expected an update from his team following a meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. military officials in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nWashington has tried for months to navigate the demands of each side as Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into major obstacles, including control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, which is mostly occupied by Russian forces.\n\nPutin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control among the key conditions for peace, a demand rejected by Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said that the U.S. had floated an idea for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk and create a demilitarized free economic zone there, a proposal he rejected as unworkable.\n\n“I do not consider this fair, because who will manage this economic zone?” he said. “If we are talking about some buffer zone along the line of contact, if we are talking about some economic zone and we believe that only a police mission should be there and troops should withdraw, then the question is very simple. If Ukrainian troops withdraw 5–10 kilometers, for example, then why do Russian troops not withdraw deeper into the occupied territories by the same distance?”\n\nZelenskyy described the issue as “very sensitive” and insisted on a freeze along the line of contact, saying that “today a fair possible option is we stand where we stand.”\n\nPutin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of the Donetsk region even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.\n\nUshakov warned that a search for compromise could take a long time, noting that the U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been “worsened” by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.\n\nSpeaking to Russian state TV in remarks broadcast Sunday, Ushakov said that “the contribution of Ukrainians and Europeans to these documents is unlikely to be constructive,\" warning that Moscow will “have very strong objections.”\n\nUshakov added that the territorial issue was actively discussed in Moscow when Witkoff and Kushner met with Putin earlier this month. “The Americans know and understand our position,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday just before the talks with Trump’s envoys, thanking him on X for his support and adding that “we are coordinating closely and working together for the sake of our shared security.”\n\nMacron vowed on X that “France is, and will remain, at Ukraine’s side to build a robust and lasting peace — one that can guarantee Ukraine’s security and sovereignty, and that of Europe, over the long term.”\n\nMerz, who has spearheaded European efforts to support Ukraine alongside Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said Saturday that “the decades of the ‘Pax Americana’ are largely over for us in Europe and for us in Germany as well.”\n\nHe warned that Putin's aim is “a fundamental change to the borders in Europe, the restoration of the old Soviet Union within its borders.”\n\n“If Ukraine falls, he won’t stop,” Merz warned on Saturday during a party conference in Munich.\n\nPutin has denied plans to restore the Soviet Union or attack any European allies.\n\nRussia and Ukraine exchange aerial attacks\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia overnight launched ballistic missiles and 138 attack drones at Ukraine. The air force said 110 had been intercepted or downed, but missile and drone hits were recorded at six locations.\n\nZelenskyy said Sunday that hundreds of thousands of families were still without power in the south, east and northeast regions and work was continuing to restore electricity, heat and water to multiple regions following a large-scale attack the previous night.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said that in the past week, Russia had launched over 1,500 strike drones, nearly 900 guided aerial bombs and 46 missiles of various types at Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 235 Ukrainian drones late Saturday and early Sunday.\n\nIn the Belgorod region, a drone injured a man and set his house ablaze in the village of Yasnye Zori, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nUkrainian drones struck an oil depot in Uryupinsk in the Volgograd region, triggering a fire, according to regional Gov. Andrei Bocharov.\n\nIn the Krasnodar region, the Ukrainian drones attacked the town of Afipsky, where an oil refinery is located. Authorities said that explosions shattered windows in residential buildings, but didn’t report any damage to the refinery.\n\nCiobanu reported from Warsaw, Poland.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

According to the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, 159 countries have recognized Palestine. The vast majority of the international community believes that a two-state solution is the only way to end decades of conflict.\n\nNetanyahu's government has said the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas.\n\nHere are some global reactions to the Australia shooting:\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei condemned the attack: “Terrorism and the killing of people, wherever they occur, are unacceptable and must be condemned.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington strongly condemned the attack and that “Antisemitism has no place in this world.”\n\nKing Charles III said he was “appalled and saddened.” He also leads the Commonwealth, and the office of Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Sunday said Herzog had reached out to the king in September warning of an “epidemic of antisemitism” in three Commonwealth countries: Britain, Canada and Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, police in London said they would step up security at Jewish sites.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack “has left me speechless” and added that “this is an attack on our shared values. We must stop this antisemitism, here in Germany and worldwide.”\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified and that “My heart is with the Jewish community worldwide on this first day of Hannukah, a festival celebrating the miracle of peace and light vanquishing darkness.”\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the “ghastly terrorist attack” and said that “we stand in solidarity with the people of Australia in this hour of grief.”\n\nThe organization's president, Ronald Lauder, said that “No community should ever fear ​coming together to celebrate its faith, traditions, or identity,” adding: “Make no mistake, this will not break us.\"\n\n\"I’m surrounded by antisemitic graffiti constantly. I think for our community in the east (of Sydney), and as a Christian, I just want to declare I stand with the people of Israel,” Anglican pastor Matt Graham told Australian Broadcasting Corp. He said he had been conducting a service at the nearby Bondi Anglican Church when panicked people began entering to take shelter.",

    "fullText": "Former Michigan Wolverines head coach Sherrone Moore appeared in court on Friday, facing multiple charges.\n\nMoore, who was Michigan's head coach for two seasons, was charged with felony home invasion, before getting released on bond. Moore was formally charged with third-degree home invasion, stalking, and breaking and entering or entering without breaking. He was allegedly at the home of the woman with whom he had been having an affair with. His \"inappropriate\" relationship ultimately led to his firing.\n\nDuring the arraignment on Friday, the prosecutor brought up the relationship.\n\n\"Our victim broke up with the defendant on Monday morning. She presented herself to [the school] and corroborated the fact they had a relationship,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nThe school acted swiftly, firing Moore on Wednesday night.\n\nMoore's attorney, meanwhile, spoke at the hearing as well.\n\n\"My client [Sherrone Moore] is 39 years old, zero prior criminal history, zero contact with the criminal justice system ... there's no evidence to suggest he's a threat to public safety.\"\n\nThe University of Michigan stands by its decision.\n\n“When the findings of a university investigation into Coach Moore’s behavior were presented on Wednesday, we immediately terminated his employment,” Grasso wrote in a letter to the university,\" the school's president said.\n\n“There is absolutely no tolerance for this conduct at the University of Michigan. None.”\n\nMoore's wife of 10 years made a 911 call to authorities following his firing earlier this week. She said that he was \"suicidal\" after \"losing his job,\" according to dispatch audio obtained by The Detroit News.\n\n\"According to our victim here, he did put a knife to his throat and ran out,\" the audio said. \"They're also advising that when he left the location on their call, he walked out with several knives.\"\n\nMoore allegedly told the woman with whom he was having an affair with, \"my blood is on your hands\" and \"you ruined my life.\"",

    "description": "The No. 1 Michigan Hockey team has been BUZZING. Here is what you may have missed from the Wolverines so far this season:",
    "fullText": "Amid the sadness and confusion this week has brought to the University of Michigan, there is some good happening in Ann Arbor, particularly with the Wolverines’ hockey team.\n\nMichigan is ranked first in the country, garnering slightly more votes than the No. 2 Wisconsin Badgers and far more than the No. 3 Michigan State Spartans. The Wolverines (16-4, 7-3 Big Ten) trail only the Badgers (12-2-2, 8-2 Big Ten) in the conference, and erasing a two-point deficit by the end of the regular season is far from improbable.\n\nThere were questions about how Michigan’s roster overhaul — headlined by a bevy of transfers and Canadian Hockey League commitments — would fare, but head coach Brandon Naurato’s squad has answered resoundingly. The Wolverines looked as dominant as the basketball team early on, ripping off seven consecutive victories before dropping the back-half of its series with the then-No. 2 Western Michigan Broncos (WMU is now ranked No. 7).\n\nMichigan has had trouble sweeping opponents, as all three of its conference losses have come on night two of series vs Wisconsin, at No. 9 Penn State and vs Michigan State.\n\nAs impressive as this first half of the regular season has been, there is reason to believe these Wolverines will only improve gradually. Naurato’s lineup is littered with young talent, namely sophomore forwards Will Horcoff (19 goals, nine assists) and Michael Hage (10 goals, 18 assists), who are tied with senior captain T.J. Hughes (nine goals, 19 assists) at 28 points.\n\nThose three have been unstoppable, and Horcoff in particular looks like he will be a very, very good NHL player with his combination of size, hands and smarts.\n\nNorth Dakota junior transfer Jayden Perron (six goals, 18 points) has a dangerous, right-handed shot and has looked more than comfortable on the power play. But beyond the skill and speed of the top six guys, Naurato has a plethora of upperclassmen grinders who bring that sandpaper and ferocity needed not only to survive, but to thrive in the Big Ten.\n\nJosh Eernissee (nine goals, 15 points) is having a productive offensive campaign. Nick Moldenhauer (three goals, 13 points) may go under the radar, but do not underestimate his forechecking impact. There are also guys like Garrett Schifsky (six goals, 10 points) and Kienan Draper (two goals, eight points) who are poised, tough forwards that further illustrate the ridiculous depth Naurato has to configure.\n\nOther notable underclassmen include a stellar group of freshmen forwards. Adam Valentini (five goals, 17 points), Malcom Spence (seven goals, 12 points), Cole McKinney (five goals, 11 points) and Aidan Park (six goals, 10 points) have delivered against the rigors of college hockey and ensure scoring is not all on the big dogs.\n\nDefensively, Cornell junior transfer Ben Robertson (14 assists) has been a revelation, bringing that veteran presence and responsible play every team covets. Senior Tyler Duke is still a stalwart and one of the more fiery competitors on a roster filled with them. Senior Luca Fantilli remains solid, too. Duke, Fantilli and Draper round out the Hughes-led leadership group, all wearing an “A.”\n\nFreshmen Asher Barnett and Drew Schock have stepped up nicely, especially after their classmate Henry Mews (9 assists in 10 games) was lost to a season-ending injury. Neither Barnett nor Schock plays like a freshman, a rare trait for anyone, but even more so on the back end.\n\nSomehow, we have gone all this time without talking about arguably Michigan’s MVP so far. Freshman goaltender Jack Ivankovic was highly touted for his work with junior Canadian national teams and was expected to right a goaltending ship that has struggled to navigate Big Ten waters in recent years.\n\nIvankovic has been everything and more. Not only has he started every game, but his numbers are impeccable — a 1.90 goals allowed average and a .927 save percentage. He may be a little small for an NHL goaltender (5-foot-11), but the Nashville Predators should be thrilled with their 2025 second-rounder. Ivankovic is the real deal.\n\nMuch like all Wolverines teams of the last decade or half-decade, this team is not built like a typical national champion. Those teams are usually old, heavy and roll four lines in their sleep. Yet, while Michigan certainly has some of the trying-to-be-too-fancy negative tendencies of late, this iteration plays the most sound and structured defensive game I have seen since enrolling in 2019, and there is clearly no shortage of scorers up top.\n\nIs this finally the year for the Wolverines? Maybe. Maybe not. But, I am confident saying Michigan will be a difficult out come postseason play and has many of the makings of (at least) a Frozen Four team.",

The offensive line play for Philadelphia has been poor, to say the least. As a result, the run game and Saquon Barkley, to be specific, have not been as effective.\n\nThe Raiders have been a disaster. However, there are still some bright spots on this roster. Brock Bowers has finally started to look like himself after recovering from his injury, but more importantly, after the firing of offensive coordinator Chip Kelly.\n\nAfter surpassing 100 rushing yards in Week 4 against the Chicago Bears, rookie running back Ashton Jeanty has not exceeded 75 rushing yards in any other game.

    "title": "China leads research in 90% of crucial tech – a dramatic shift this century",
    "description": "The United States tops the remaining areas in an assessment of 74 technologies.",
    "fullText": "China is leading research in nearly 90% of the crucial technologies that “significantly enhance, or pose risks to, a country’s national interests”, according to a technology tracker run by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) — an independent think-tank.\n\nThe ASPI’s Critical Technology Tracker evaluated research on 74 current and emerging technologies this year, up from the 64 technologies it analyzed last year. China is ranked number one for research on 66 of the technologies, including nuclear energy, synthetic biology, small satellites, while the United States topped the remaining 8, including quantum computing and geoengineering.\n\nThe results reflect a drastic reversal. At the beginning of this century, the United States led more than 90% of the assessed technologies, whereas China led less than 5% of them, according to the 2024 edition of the tracker.\n\n“China has made incredible progress on science and technology that is reflected in research and development, as well as in publications,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, who researches China’s industrial policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a non-profit research organization based in Washington DC.\n\nMazzocco says the general trend identified by the ASPI is not a surprise, but it is “remarkable” to see that China is so dominant and advanced in so many fields compared with the United States.\n\nThis might have something to do with the type of technologies that are tracked, says Wang Yanbo, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong. The country is more likely to be a research leader in new technologies, where it has focused its efforts, compared to traditional fields where other country's lead, such as semi conductor chips, he notes.\n\nThe ASPI team based its analysis on a database that contains more than nine million publications from all around the world. It ranked nations in each technology by identifying the top 10% of the most-cited papers produced by researchers in a country over a five-year period, between 2020 and 2024, and calculated that country's global share.\n\nOne noteworthy finding is that China is outpacing the United States in cloud and edge computing, according to David Lin, a national security and technology strategist at the Special Competitive Studies Project, a non-profit organization based in Arlington, Virginia. Cloud computing enables artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train models and process data without the need for physical infrastructure, whereas edge computing processes data locally. China’s research intensity in these fields “probably reflects the urgency with which Beijing is moving AI from the lab into deployment”, Lin says.\n\nThe analysis should not be interpreted as “a collapse of American power”, says Steven Hai, a political economist focusing on technology innovation at Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University in Suzhou, China. In general, the United States is still an important player globally in these technologies, Hai says.\n\nJenny Wong-Leung, a data scientist at ASPI who participated in the study, warns that the findings show democratic nations risk losing “hard-won, long-term advantages in cutting-edge science and research” in a range of essential sectors, which is the crucial for the development and advancement of the world’s most important technologies.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-04048-7\n\nGrowing cities face mounting challenges\n\nChina accounts for more than half of leading output in the applied sciences\n\nGeothermal networks let cities warm and cool as one\n\nWill young universities set the pace in the age of AI?\n\nWhat would an AI university look like and how might it change education?\n\nChina is leading the world on AI governance: other countries must engage\n\nAustralia’s world-first social media ban is a ‘natural experiment’ for scientists\n\nChina is leading the world on AI governance: other countries must engage\n\nThe top US health director who stood up for science — and was fired\n\nJoin HZAU's global faculty team to advance research with competitive benefits.\n\nNo.1 Shizishan Street, Hongshan District, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China\n\nHuazhong Agricultural University (HZAU)\n\nChair Professors / Professors / Associate Professors / Assistant Professors\n\nGreat Bay University, China (GBU)\n\nseeking outstanding, innovative tenured/tenure-track Principal Investigators to establish independent research programs\n\nExceptional young scholars worldwide with strong research achievements in relevant fields\n\nInstitute of Nanotechnology and Intelligence (inAI), Jinan University, China.",

    "fullText": "Denmark has labeled the United States as a potential security concern for the first time in an annual report released by one of its intelligence agencies, offering more evidence of the increasingly fraught transatlantic alliance between Europe and the US.\n\nThe report, compiled by the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS), warns that the US “uses economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to enforce its will and no longer rules out the use of military force, even against allies.”\n\nThat assessment forms part of the service’s wider analysis that “great powers increasingly prioritize their own interests and use force to achieve their goals.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the US Embassy in Copenhagen and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in Washington for comment.\n\nApart from its warning relating to the US, the report largely focuses on strategic threats posed by Russia and China, as well as instability brought about by China’s rise and the resulting global shift in power.\n\nIt points out that the “military threat from Russia to NATO will increase,” a concern magnified for the Danes since “there is uncertainty about the role of the United States as a guarantor of Europe’s security.”\n\nDenmark’s normally friendly relationship with its NATO ally grew strained earlier this year when US President Donald Trump expressed an interest in taking control of Greenland, an autonomous, resource-rich, strategically significant Arctic island that is legally part of the Danish kingdom.\n\nWhile Trump has not revisited that idea for months, it signaled his willingness to stress the US’s relationship with its European partners following decades of close cooperation since the end of World War II.\n\nThat relationship is once again under scrutiny as the differing strategic priorities of the US and Europe have been exposed in the recent Ukrainian peace talks and, most dramatically, in the national security strategy released Friday by the Trump administration, which adopted an unprecedented confrontational posture toward Europe.\n\nAnd for Denmark, the threats posed by Russia and the US are intertwined. The report argues that “Russia will try to exploit the US desire for a quick end to the (Ukraine) war to sow division between the US and Europe.”",

    "fullText": "Senior DP members previously allege being told to disband or face severe consequences including possible arrest\n\nHong Kong’s last major opposition party has disbanded after a vote by its members, the culmination of Chinese pressure on the city’s remaining liberal voices in a years-long security crackdown.\n\nThe Democratic party (DP) has been Hong Kong’s main opposition since its founding three years before the financial hub’s return to Chinese rule in 1997. The party used to sweep city-wide legislative elections and push China on democratic reforms and upholding freedoms.\n\nHowever, mass pro-democracy protests in 2019 against a perceived tightening of China’s grip on the city prompted Beijing to enact a sweeping national security law to stifle dissent.\n\nOn Sunday, DP members voted to disband the party and to enter liquidation, its chair, Lo Kin-hei, told reporters after an extraordinary general meeting.\n\n“To have journeyed through these three decades, shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong, has been our greatest honour. Throughout these years, we have always treated the wellbeing of Hong Kong and its people as our guiding purpose,” Lo said.\n\nOf 121 votes cast, 117 were in favour of disbanding while four were abstentions.\n\nSenior party members previously told Reuters they had been approached by Chinese officials or “middlemen” and told to disband or face severe consequences, including possible arrest.\n\nThere was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Hong Kong Liaison Office, China’s main representative body in the special administrative region.\n\nEmily Lau, a former DP chair, expressed regret at the vote’s outcome.\n\n“Why does an organisation that has done so much for Hong Kong need to end like this? I find it very problematic,” she said.\n\nChina’s “one country, two systems” arrangement, promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. However, in recent years, authorities have used new security laws to arrest scores of opponents, disband civil society groups and close media outlets.\n\n“We were never able to have democracy. We never had the chance to elect our government … We hope it [the principle of one country, two systems] won’t keep shrinking more and more. We hope there won’t be more and more people being arrested,” Lau said.\n\nThe DP’s vote to disband came a week after Hong Kong held a “patriots only” legislative council election and a day before a verdict is due in the national security trial of the media mogul and China critic Jimmy Lai.\n\nChina’s move in 2021 to overhaul Hong Kong’s electoral system – allowing only those vetted as “patriots” to run for public office – marginalised the DP by removing it from mainstream politics.\n\nIn June, another pro-democracy group, the League of Social Democrats, said it would disband amid “immense political pressure”.\n\nSenior DP members Wu Chi-wai, Albert Ho, Helena Wong and Lam Cheuk-ting have been jailed or held in custody under a national security law that China imposed in 2020 in response to mass pro-democracy protests the year before.\n\nSome governments, including those of the US and the UK, have criticised the law, saying it has been used to stifle dissent and individual freedom.\n\nChina has said no freedom is absolute and that the national security law has restored stability to Hong Kong.",

    "description": "When someone commits a horrific, inexplicable crime, we naturally wonder whether he’s mentally ill: Who but a crazy person could do such a thing? But...",
    "fullText": "When someone commits a horrific, inexplicable crime, we naturally wonder whether he’s mentally ill: Who but a crazy person could do such a thing? But when a killer acts crazy after his arrest, we also might wonder whether he’s preparing for his trial. That’s the speculation around Colorado shooter James Holmes, whose psychiatric treatment and bizarre behavior in court and prison make people wonder whether he’s truly insane or building a case for an insanity defense. It leads to the question: Can a criminal get away with faking insanity?\n\nExperts have been debating that question since the creation of the insanity defense in the mid-19th century. To avoid the noose or the guillotine, criminals of the era would fake symptoms from the then-emerging field of psychology. It soon became a cat-and-mouse game: Criminals would act out their understanding of insane behaviors, and alienists (the era’s term for psychologists) would write studies on how to detect those “malingerers.” Most techniques relied on the investigators’ experience and powers of observation—looking for inconsistencies in symptoms, waiting until the suspect tired of the game, or simply catching a telltale look in his eye. As the Austrian criminologist Hans Gross wrote: “The shammer, when he thinks no one is looking, casts a swift and scrutinizing glance on the Investigating Officer to see whether or not he believes him.”\n\nToday, less than 1 percent of felony defendants raise an insanity defense, and a tiny fraction of those succeed. Yet in a state like Colorado, where proving insanity can avert a death sentence, the temptation to appear mentally ill must be strong. And so modern forensic psychologists, just like their forebears, watch for malingering with a sharp clinical eye. They determine whether the symptoms match those of well-studied pathologies and whether the signs remain consistent over time. They also can apply a battery of tests that essentially fake-out the faker.\n\nThe first step is to do a thorough review of the suspect’s history. Mental illness doesn’t develop overnight, so it’s important to know if the person has been hospitalized or treated for similar symptoms. The investigators also review the crime-scene report. If the suspect has hidden the weapon, washed off his fingerprints, or taken other steps to elude the police, it’s a sign of clear thinking—not mental illness.\n\nThen come one or more long, rambling interviews—the longer the better, because after a few hours, some suspects begin to lose track of their symptoms or grow weary of the con. Phillip J. Resnick, professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, says he asks the suspect to talk at length about his history before saying a word about the crime, to lessen the chance of “retrofitting” a pattern of alleged illness to the deed. He and his colleagues listen carefully for signs of particular mental illnesses.\n\n“Most malingerers don’t read the psychological literature,” says Tali Walters, a Boston forensic psychologist, so they present a Hollywood version of how a crazy person acts.\n\nFor example, some suspects claim to hear voices in their head that they’re powerless to resist, a commonly dramatized depiction of schizophrenia. Unlike what we see in the movies, most auditory hallucinations are benign; they seem to originate outside the head (not inside), and rarely come from aliens or other non-human beings. Only a small percentage are “command hallucinations,” and even fewer command a violent act. Furthermore, genuine schizophrenics find strategies to ignore these voices, or even make peace with them. They learn that certain activities, such as exercise, mute the voices; while others, such as watching TV, encourage them—the “voice” can’t seem to resist commenting on what it sees.\n\nSo if a suspect says he feels compelled to obey alien voices inside his head telling him to kill, there’s a good chance he’s feigning. Case in point: David Berkowitz, aka “Son of Sam,” who shot six people in a three-year murder spree in New York. Berkowitz claimed that he was following the commands of a demon-possessed Labrador retriever, but later admitted it was a hoax. “A dog,” says Resnick, “is not a typical [auditory] hallucination.”\n\nMalingerers often exaggerate their symptoms and ignore common, subtle signs such as the blunting of a mentally ill patient’s emotions. Some fakers say one thing and do another. They might feign confusion to the psychiatrist but later converse easily with cell-mates, or claim to be paranoid while sitting at ease. Some combine symptoms from different conditions, such as hallucinations of schizophrenia and obscene outbursts found in Tourette’s syndrome. The forensic psychologist may suggest an outrageous delusion during the interview, such as, “Do you believe cars are part of an organized religion?” Fakers might latch onto this bait and perhaps even run with it. Real schizophrenics would say no.\n\nAt some point the examiner leads the discussion to the crime, which sets another trip-wire for deceivers. No matter how delusional the suspect claims to be, the crime scene must fit the hallucinations he describes. It’s hard to believe a suspect who says he was slashing wildly with a kitchen knife against an army of aliens when he actually left a single stab wound in his mother’s chest. Another clue is a cover story that conveniently mixes delusion and reality.\n\n“Sometimes all it takes is one sentence,” says Resnick. “It’s one thing to say ‘God told me to kill my mother to save all mankind.” It’s quite another to say, “God told me to kill my mother so I could get money to buy more drugs.”\n\nThere are also standardized tests that trip up malingerers. A preliminary, 10-minute test, called M-FAST (Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test), presents a series 25 questions that intermix phony and real symptoms. It’s almost impossible to pick the right combinations if you’re not mentally ill or a highly trained forensic psychologist. A more thorough series of questions, called SIRS (Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms) takes about an hour.\n\nThere’s even a test for faking amnesia, which is among the most common of feigned mental illnesses. Contrary to popular belief, people with amnesia don’t completely lose their ability to remember things. So forensic psychologists give a memory test that’s so easy that even a person with amnesia could pass it. They show a series of letters, numbers, and shapes for a few seconds and then ask him to draw them on a blank sheet of paper. Even people with amnesia caused by brain damage can reproduce most of the symbols. The only way to fail is if you do so on purpose. “I don’t want to be so specific that people can avoid our detection methods,” says Jerry J. Sweet, director of neuropsychology for the North Shore University Health System in Evanston, Ill. “So in this case we try not to educate the public.”\n\nThe psychologists and psychiatrists interviewed for this story were hesitant to comment on the Holmes case, not having seen the suspect or his file. But they voiced suspicion over his claimed amnesia, which is exceedingly rare without brain injury, drugs, or another medical condition. Walters cautioned that even though Holmes’ psychiatrist reportedly sent a warning to the University of Colorado’s threat team, it’s not clear whether the behavior that triggered the warning resulted directly from mental illness.\n\nSurveys show that of the roughly 60,000 “competency to stand trial” referrals forensic psychologists evaluate each year, anywhere from 8 percent to 17 percent of the suspects are found to be faking it.\n\nProbably the most brilliant malingerer ever was the mafia chieftain Vincent Gigante, dubbed “Oddfather” by the New York press for his strange behavior. For decades, he shuffled about Greenwich Village in his pajamas, talking to parking meters, slobbering, and muttering to show mental incompetence. When brought up on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and racketeering, he fooled several leading psychologists and delayed the trial for half a dozen years. Even after he was sent to jail in 1997, he maintained the appearance of insanity. It wasn’t until 2003, when he plea-bargained his way out of more serious charges, that Gigante admitted it had all been a sham.",

    "description": "I’ve spent the last few years building my own game engine from scratch. Here are some of the things I learned.",
    "fullText": "Our next game, Dave’s Word Game, comes out tomorrow.\nThis is very exciting for several reasons, but for me personally\nit’s significant as it’s the first thing we’ve done in Growl, my game engine\nproject I’ve been working on, at first sporadically and then pretty seriously,\nfor the last few years.\n\nI started doing this mostly for fun and for my own learning, but I had a couple\nof other motivations. The first was that our previous game,\nFeud, was written in Java\nusing libGDX. libGDX is a great library, but, while I’m not a Java hater, it\ncertainly caused us no end of issues around things like code signing and\nportability to other platforms, particularly iOS. Compound that with my dream of\neventually releasing stuff on Switch and it became clear I needed something\nelse.\n\nAround 2019, I did a little bit of open source work on\nHalley, the game engine used by\nChucklefish and largely developed by Rodrigo Braz Monteiro, a fearsomely\ntalented game programmer. Rodrigo was kind and patient enough to answer all my\nstupid questions and I eventually managed to port the engine to iOS and to\nMetal, Apple’s graphics library. I had so much fun. I was hooked.\n\nIt was at around this time that I started entertaining the idea of making my own\nengine. The amount of stuff I’d need to learn was intimidating - I had basically\nzero experience in graphics programming and none whatsoever in fonts, audio,\ninput, UI and all the myriad other things needed to make even the simplest 2D\nengine function. A few years later, in early 2022, I took my first baby steps.\n\nI’m not going to try and make the argument here that anyone should make their\nown game engine. If your priority is to actually ship a game, it’s probably the\nmost time-inefficient way possible to make that happen. I’ve seen so many\nfriends fall into the trap of having so much fun making the engine they never\nget around to making a game in it, and while I actually think this is a pretty\nnice outcome it’s not what I wanted for myself. However, I can’t think of any\nother software project I’ve ever done where I have pushed myself so far, learned\nso much, and spoken to so many interesting and talented people in the process.\nIf you want to have a good time writing code, a game engine might be the best\nway to do that.\n\nI’m going to write this chronologically, going through the various different\nthings I had to learn about and implement to get this working. The timeline will\nbe a bit strange - I had to finish Feud while I was doing this, and then at a\ncertain point the majority of development was on Dave’s Word Game itself and not\nthe engine. Feel free to follow along in Growl’s commit history, if you dare.\n\nThis post is quite long. Here’s a table of contents.\n\nI decided at the beginning I was going to use C++ 17; my reasons for this were\nprobably laughably vague, being simply “that’s what Halley uses”. In hindsight,\nthere have been a few C++ 20 features I’ve missed out on but largely 17 has been\nfine. At the time, though, I barely knew C++, and had some stupid idea that I\nwas going to try and write the engine in such a way that someone could use it\nwithout knowing all that “hard stuff” like move semantics. I was quickly\ndisabused of this notion by my good pals Pat and Stu, yet more extremely\ntalented programmers with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of patience for Local\nIdiot Asking Questions. This is one of the prerequisites of writing a game\nengine.\n\n(Stu’s new game, Substructure, was revealed\nrecently, and you should definitely check if out if you’re a Factorio sicko like\nhe is.)\n\nI knew just about enough about CMake at this point to hurt myself badly with it.\nI had to do quite a substantial refactor later in the year.\n\nThe structure of the engine was heavily inspired by Halley, which uses a plugin\nbased architecture where everything is a type of plugin; system, graphics,\naudio, network and so on. The API was designed to be very much like libGDX, with\nan “outside-in” style of architecture where the user is responsible for bringing\nthe executable entry point. I had to bend this a bit for iOS and Android.\n\nI started out building the basic interfaces for the various APIs, which at the\nbeginning looked like this:\n\nI would eventually add NetworkAPI and ScriptingAPI, but that wasn’t til\nquite a bit later.\n\nMy first System API was for SDL2, and for graphics it was my old friend Metal.\nThe first thing I ever got it to do was create a window and clear the background\ncolour in it. I was extremely proud of this.\n\nThe next thing was loading and rendering textures. Metal makes this relatively\neasy to do, but I still needed to go and relearn what the hell a projection was,\nhaving not touched this kind of maths since university. Here’s an early attempt\nusing some assets from Feud - you can see I hadn’t really got my head around\nthe matrix maths yet.\n\nEventually I got a somewhat sensible structure working for textures, sprite\nbatches, and shaders. I then started trying to implement the same thing in\nOpenGL as an additional graphics plugin.\n\nI think I may be somewhat atypical in going from Metal to OpenGL rather than the\nother way around, and while this did make some things quite hard I think it also\ntaught me some good habits - putting things in buffers, for example, is\nthe default in Metal, and while it’s considered a modern best practice in OpenGL\na lot of the beginner tutorials don’t teach it.\n\nI started using this image of a cat for testing as it was something I could put\ninto a public repo, and it stayed as the unofficial mascot of Growl until I\neventually replaced it\nwith a picture of my own cat.\n\nNext, I had my eye on doing texture atlases, something I used extensively in\nFeud, and for that I’d need the ability to create those offline. I was and am\nresistant to the idea of shipping the engine with an “editor” - I tend to do\neverything I possibly can in a terminal and resent ever needing to touch a\nmouse - so I made a command-line tool, growl-cmd. I used CLI11 for this, which is great. This tool has\nbasically been unchanged since; I had a vision of also adding stuff like Metal\nshader precompilation to it but never really got around to it.\n\nThe texture atlases and render-to-texture came next. This was fun! I learned a\nlot writing my own bleed algorithm for the texture atlases and implementing the\nskyline algorithm for the packing, and needing to grapple with concepts like\nhalf-pixel correction was a tremendous learning experience even if it did make\nmy brain hot like an old laptop. Some of the test images from the time were\ntrippy, I wish I still had them.\n\nOne fairly important thing I added at this point was a Result/Error type. I\ndon’t really like the way exceptions work in most languages, but I do like Go’s\nstyle of value based error handling, so I made a simple class for this, based on\nstd::variant. It was at this stage I needed to go and really get my head\naround move semantics, rvalues, and a small amount of templates; things I had\nlittle comparable experience in from other languages, so this was hard. The\n#joel-learns-things channel on my Discord server got a lot of use this month.\n\nI added keyboard, mouse and gamepad input using SDL’s event system. I remember\nbeing surprised at how easy it was - SDL does a huge amount for you here. Having\neven the most basic input possible suddenly changed this from feeling like a\nrendering library to feeling like something that could make games. Steady on,\nkid, long way to go yet.\n\nBecause I didn’t at this stage have a particular game I was trying to make, I\nwas free to follow my own interests. I didn’t have any sort of audio support in\nthe engine yet but I had a couple of weeks off work and decided to take a big\nol’ detour into text rendering.\n\nText is a fascinating topic that more than deserves its own writeup, which I’ve\nbeen telling myself I’ll do for three years now. Due to my frustrations getting\ncertain languages supported in Feud, I had pretty big ambitions for this; I was\ngoing to support CJK, RTL, BiDi, emojis, the lot. In the end I added Signed\nDistance Fields to this list. I’m pretty proud of Growl’s text rendering.\n\nThe first bit was learning to actually parse fonts and extract the glyphs, so\nthat I could pack them into a texture atlas offline. Feud would rebuild font\natlases on the fly, which works totally fine for English and is abysmally slow\nfor Simplified Chinese. Here’s an image showing the extracted glyphs of an emoji\nfont, for some reason:\n\nWith font atlases done came rendering the text. I used a combination of\nHarfbuzz, FreeType and utfcpp to parse strings, determine their layout and then\nmatch the glyphs up to those in my font atlas. Harfbuzz does a lot of the work\nfor you, so extending this to support non-Latin scripts and even emojis with\nZero Width Joiners (used to specify things like skin tone) wasn’t too much of a\nstretch.\n\nNext up was the SDF fonts. The big advantage of these is that you can pre-bake\njust one font atlas at a fixed size, and then use your shader to make that font\nscale and appear crisp at any other size, within limits. This meant I could do\nthe sort of dynamic text resizing that would have been much harder in Feud, and\nI wouldn’t have to build fonts at runtime.\n\nI settled on Multi-Channel Signed Distance Fonts for this, a method developed by Viktor\nChlumský, inspired by the original Valve paper. This involves generating font\natlases using the three colour channels in addition to the alpha channel SDF\nfonts use.\n\nIntegrating this into my rendering stack proved to be quite tricky; I had to do\na lot of fiddling with it to get FreeType’s metrics to match up to the metrics\nemitted by MSDFgen. I’m still making adjustments to it even now, and the MSDF\nfonts don’t look exactly like their rasterised counterparts, but it’s a\ndifference so slight only I will notice and get annoyed by it. Here are a few\nold screenshots showing my attempts to get it working.\n\nI implemented line breaking after this, using libunibreak. In the end I didn’t get around to\ndoing bidirectional text, but it’s on my list. Here’s a screenshot showing where\nthe text rendering ended up:\n\nI finally got around to doing audio next. I went with SoLoud, which does most of\nthe work for me, so in the end I didn’t need to learn that much about audio\nprogramming. However, SoLoud is now effectively unmaintained, so I have a vague\nplan to migrate to MiniAudio, which will require me to learn a bit more as\nthat library is rather more low-level.\n\nThe one slightly tricky bit with the audio was getting streaming to work from my\nasset bundle - I don’t encrypt the data in the bundle but it’s all smooshed\ntogether contiguously, so I needed to write some file adapter code to get SoLoud\nto be able to read it.\n\nOne thing I regret not investing \nchange to the game, even tweaking an asset or changing the speed of an\nanimation, required the other lads to upload things to Google Drive and then get\nme to make the change in the code. While I wasn’t interested in building an\neditor for Growl, I did want some sort of way to make it easier to plug in\nexternal tooling.\n\nDear ImGui was the natural choice for this.\nI added a little debug menu in-game, and then certain variables could be bound\nto sliders in that UI. I would go on to add quite a bit of tooling to this menu,\neventually turning it into something a bit more like an embedded editor, though\nstill much leaner than a real editor would be.\n\nI also started doing the porting process here. iOS was the first port of call,\nas I was a bit more familiar with it, though in the intervening few years I’d\nforgotten how strange Objective C’s memory model can be. The plugin architecture\nlent itself well to porting, and Metal is consistent enough between macOS and\niOS that I hardly needed to change anything at all, just adjust some memory\nalignment issues. I was very pleased when I got the test app running on my iPad;\nit brought back that thrill from the Halley days. Porting is so much fun.\n\nIt was around this time that Dave, knowing I was after some kind of simple game\nidea to dogfood the engine with, told me about his word game idea, then unnamed.\nFrom this point on DWG became the guiding force of the engine - I’d work on it\nfor a little bit, realise some other huge thing was totally missing, then go and\nimplement that into Growl. Having this structure meant I was much less likely\nto go off on a side quest (though that certainly did still happen). Here’s the\nearliest screenshot I can find of Dave’s Word Game with its original art style,\nrendered in Growl.\n\nAndroid was the next target. I’d done quite a lot of Android development - it\nwas probably the first thing I ever really programmed for - but I’d never gone\nnear the NDK. I ended up using GameActivity, which makes a few things like\ninput handling a little easier.\n\nI found Android really interesting. There were a few issues I needed to iron\nout - in particular, I only supported OpenGL, not OpenGL ES, so I needed to do a\nbit of messing with loaders and so on - but for the most part it was relatively\nsmooth. The documentation is decent, and I remain pretty amazed at Android’s\ncommitment to backward compatibility; both my test devices were from 2013 and\nthey worked totally fine.\n\nAmusingly, I could also run it on the Oculus Quest, it being essentially an\nAndroid phone strapped to the face.\n\nI was determined to do everything I could to stay in the NDK and avoid having\nany Java code or build system at all; I really didn’t want to have to mix CMake\nand Gradle, and having multiple languages felt icky. I wrote a blog post at the time explaining how to\npackage an APK without using any of the Gradle based tools. Later, I would\nabandon this, as some things simply can’t be done without bridging to Java via\nJNI.\n\nI would later come to encounter a lot of Android-specific issues, particularly\naround streaming audio from disk, but at this point I was high on the joy of\nporting and I was happy.\n\nThings got a little silly from here out.\n\nI had been very deliberately architecting the engine towards maximum\nportability, and getting it to run on 3DS (via the homebrew SDK) felt like the\nbest possible test of that. It worked, kind of! I never got around to doing\naudio, but it was able to load stuff from the asset bundle and render it on\nscreen.\n\n3DS is a tricky platform for Growl, which is built around the assumption that\nwhatever it’s running on has a shader pipeline of some description. The 3DS has\nprogrammable vertex shaders but, weirdly, fixed-function fragment shaders. This\nmeant that getting stuff like the SDF font rendering to work was a little\nbeyond my capabilities. Still, a good learning experience, and I actually made a\nsmall contribution to Harfbuzz to get it building on arm-none-eabi; getting to interact briefly\nwith Behdad Esfahbod left me a little starstruck.\n\nI also got the engine running on web, via Emscripten - because Emscripten ships\nwith an SDL2 implementation this ended up being very easy indeed. You can have a\nplay with it here, though bear in\nmind it’s a very old version of the engine!\n\nBack to DWG, and realised the next thing I needed was a scene graph or some sort\nof UI toolkit; I found that I was essentially implementing that in the game and\nthought it made more sense to have in the engine. I put together a simple\nhierarchical scene graph, where positions, scales and rotations could be put on\na parent node and they’d be applied to any children. I had to root around in my\nbrain to remember how order of operation for this type of matrix maths works,\nbut it wasn’t too complicated.\n\nI took a break from Growl at the start of 2023, and this ended up being a break\nthat lasted nearly the whole year. This surprises me, looking back! I don’t\nremember a period where I wasn’t working on it. Time is an illusion and all\nthat.\n\nAnyway, in 2023 I had a couple of other projects consuming all my time. I\nhad to get Feud out of Early Access, and there was quite a lot to do there. One\nof the tasks was to get it built for the Epic Games Store, and making it work\nwith Epic Online Services. EOS don’t ship a Java SDK, and Feud is written in\nJava, so I ended up being inspired by steamworks4j and made my own library, eos4j. This was my first experience using JNI, and\nit would come to be very useful later down the line when I had to move a bunch\nof Growl’s Android stuff out to Java.\n\nYou should play Feud, by the way. It consumed eight years of my life and I have\na sort of resentment towards it but I’m also really proud of it.\n\nTowards the end of 2023 I dipped my toes back into Growl, hooking up the ImGui\ndebug menu to the scene graph. This meant I could have various widgets and\ndoodads attached to the nodes in the graph, making it organised a bit more like\nwhat you’d see in the editor of a big game engine.\n\nIn the new year, I got a bit distracted again.\n\nI had this idea that having built-in scripting support would be really useful in\nsome games. I had a little toy shmup idea I was playing around with and being\nable to adjust enemy behaviour and so on without needing to rebuild the game\nsounded really cool. We ended up not using this at all in DWG, but it’s in the\nengine, it works, and I spent ages on it so I’m going to talk about it.\n\nRather than pick one language as the default, I wanted to make scripting\nlanguages act like plugins via a Scripting API. The idea was you could bind\nfunctions to scripts and then the scripting layer in the engine would take care\nof doing all the language-specific bits to connect everything up. I would\nprovide Lua scripting as a reference implementation, but wanted it to be\npossible to drop in something like Wren.\n\nThis is insanely over-engineered, and it took about six months of my life to get\nit properly working. In the process I had to take my first hesitant steps into\nthe world of template metaprogramming, from which I have still not\npsychologically recovered.\n\nThe end result is this fairly clean setup where you can attach a script like\nthis to any arbitrary node and “override” any methods that have been made\navailable to the scripting layer.\n\nI’ve not revisited the scripting stuff in over a year and still haven’t really\nused it in anger, so no doubt there’s still a lot to do there.\n\nTowards the middle of the year I also put a bit of time into tidying up how\nGrowl manages shaders, applies uniforms and allows for users to package custom\nshaders in the asset bundle, then edit them live in the debug menu. Once again,\nthis wasn’t something I needed for DWG, but I’d been playing around with\nShadertoy and thought it’d be neat to have a\nlittle shader playground in Growl.\n\nI went with a setup where every shader gets a shared “header” prepended to it\nbefore compilation, so that every (fragment) shader has access to variables like\ntime and screen resolution. I made my little playground and started using it\nwhen doing shader tutorials. It’s on GitHub.\n\nI had a scene graph, now I needed to add the UI framework on top of that.\nI decided to go with something fairly similar to GTK, the first UI library I\never used - widgets (a specialisation of the scene graph’s nodes) get added as\nchildren and provide their packing preferences (expand, fill, margins and so\non).\n\nI followed Scene2d’s approach to validation/invalidation/layout, which worked\nnicely at first and then became quite tricky due to text reflow causing\ninvalidations up and down the tree. I had to tinker with that for quite a while\nto get it working reliably.\n\nTowards the end of the year, once the UI stuff was in, I felt it was time to go\nback to DWG armed with the new Growl features and Dave’s newest designs. We\nbuilt a prototype relatively quickly, and had our families playing with it over\nthe Christmas holidays.\n\nDWG had always been intended as a small dogfooding exercise, but once we started\nplaying it and saw our families interact with it we realised it was actually\nreally fun, and after some encouragement we decided to try and make the whole\nthing.\n\nThe focus now squarely on DWG, everything I did on Growl was driven by whatever\nthat game needed at the time. This meant the development was quite scattered,\nmostly small additions and changes rather than big new features, though I did\nadd a couple of significant things.\n\nOne really fun addition was haptic feedback - in Growl this is responsible for\nboth mobile haptics and controller rumble. Building this out was really\nenjoyable, and the addition of haptics into the game made it immediately feel so\nmuch more polished. iOS in particular has a really robust and powerful haptics\nsystem that you can do a lot with. It’s hard to show it in a screenshot, though.\n\nThe other big addition was networking support. This was a lot harder than I\nexpected; networking is one area I have a lot of confidence in, but the\ndifficulty ended up being around managing dependencies for it. The various\ndifferent platforms handle networking and particularly TLS in quite different\nways, with some having libraries provided and some requiring you to bring your\nown. I use vendored dependencies in Growl, but OpenSSL is so large that adding\nit immediately ballooned the size of the build. It took a while to work out\nwhich libraries to use on which platform.\n\nThe rest of the year was spent adding what I needed, when I needed it: dark mode\nquerying, text input, new UI widgets, file I/O, interpolations, a preferences\nsystem and mobile share sheets all made appearances. Most of my time was spent\nin the DWG codebase itself, though, so Growl changes became a bit more sporadic.\n\nI implemented things like platform login and achievements in DWG rather than in\nGrowl. I don’t really have a super good justification for why this stuff felt\nlike it didn’t belong in the engine. Some of the flows do end up being quite\ngame-specific, and it’s quite hard to make achievements stuff generic, but\nI might well move it in or make it a separate library at some point.\n\nTomorrow, December 15th, Dave’s Word Game launches on iOS and Android. We plan\nto put the PC version out a little later. Please play it! You can preregister at\nplaydwg.com.\n\nIn the grand scheme of games and game engines, Growl is very basic. It’s 2D only\nand doesn’t have many of the more advanced features of an engine like Unity or\nGodot. If the goal was simply to build Dave’s Word Game, it probably would have\nbeen faster to just do it in Java again.\n\nBut! If I hadn’t started making my own engine, DWG would probably not have\nhappened. I wouldn’t have learned C++, or OpenGL, or Metal, or about font\nrendering, or how to integrate Lua, or CMake, or the myriad other little bits\nof knowledge that are now lodged in my brain. It has been intensely rewarding,\nand probably the most enjoyable project I’ve ever undertaken.\n\nI’ve also met some really interesting and inspiring people. In particular are\nthe denizens of the Game Engine Developers Discord server, which I was added to\nat a time when I couldn’t reasonably call myself that. They have been incredibly\nsupportive, and I want to shout out Ruby, Rodrigo and Pat in particular for\nanswering my stupid questions, giving encouragement, and saying “hell yeah” at\nexactly the right moments. Also Ruby for the phrase “solve problems that exist”\nwhich, yeah, I’ll keep trying.\n\nIt’s hard to say right now what the next things to add to Growl are. We have a\nroadmap for DWG, but it’s mostly things that won’t need additions to the engine.\nInevitably, some of them will turn out to need changes, but I can’t yet\nforesee any big new features. Perhaps whatever the next game is will drive those\nrequirements!\n\nAt the back of my mind I do have the desire to tidy up Growl, document it, make\nit usable to other people. That’s a lot of work, though, and it’s not yet clear\nthere’s anyone out there who wants to use it who wouldn’t be better served by\nsomething like Godot, so I’m holding fire.\n\nIf you’re thinking about building a game engine, be aware that it will consume\nso much more of your life than you expect. But you’ll have the best time.",

    "description": "A twelve-year-old's perspective on the most hated input device",
    "fullText": "The Magic Mouse is the most controversial computer peripheral. The haters eschew it in favor of a big, bulky, button-packed Logitech MX Master 3S. But why does half the web so strongly dislike it, and why does that drive them to create the anti-Magic Mouse?\n\nFor one, the mouse’s charger port is on the bottom, which means you can’t use it while you’re charging it. Since you only have to about charge it once a month, it’s not nearly as big of a deal as Reddit would have you think. (My dad, an iMac user, finds that not being able to use it upside-down is quite annoying when he forgets to charge it, but he’s been using it for years and happy with it overall.)\n\nAlso, some people find that the mouse’s shape is unergonomic and uncomfortable. Again, a valid concern, but not something everyone cares about/notices. People talk all about how the Magic Mouse is horrible, how could Apple sell such a product. But the issues aren’t that big.\n\nPeople have tried to fix both concerns. Of course, buying a standard computer mouse can solve both issues, or, if you want to be fancy about it, get an MX Master 3S. But over the past few years, we’ve seen products pop up like the $30 Magic Mouse sock, an off-brand Amazon product that attaches to the bottom of the Magic Mouse and adds a more ergonomic grip and MagSafe charging (still not as cool as the Razer mousepads that beam charge to your mouse).\n\nI saw another, even more interesting product to address people’s hatred, the Melt Mouse (courtesy of clicks ‘n clacks, one of my favorite newsletters). The Melt Mouse is a distinct computer peripheral that keeps all the same swipe-y gestures of the Magic Mouse, but gives it a much more defined, ergonomic shape and a shortcut pad. It also uses LRAs, which provide haptic feedback, instead of buttons to click. LRAs are the same thing that Apple uses in its Magic Trackpad and the trackpads that come with its MacBooks (another thing you could get if you hate the Magic Mouse). I think that when Sensel, the company that makes the haptic trackpads in pretty much every PC (though I don’t believe Apple uses them), goes public, they’d be a great investment, because they’re going to be in every PC laptop within the next few years.\n\nThe Melt Mouse seems really interesting, and might be a good purchase if you have a very strong dislike for the Magic Mouse. One thing to note is that the charging port appears to be on the bottom from the renders, but looks like it’s in a spot that you can still use it while it’s charging (fingers crossed). The most useful feature, for me at least, is that you can turn the mouse into trackpad mode, which lets you use things like pinch-to-zoom. I do think that Melt Interface should have done slightly more market research, because just the potential for the charging port to be on the bottom might lead to a boycott. I also think they need a better name. The current name evokes images of computer mice disintegrating, which probably isn’t their goal?\n\nI’d say that if you hate your Magic Mouse, get a Magic Trackpad. If you want a mouse, get a Logitech MX Master 3S. If you miss the gestures but still hate your Magic Mouse, get a Melt Mouse (assuming you have money to spare, because every single one of those is quite pricey, including the Melt Mouse, which you can buy from Kickstarter for $270).\n\nOr just pause and take a moment to think — these supposed issues are barely issues. Why am I wasting my time throwing mice at the wall?",

    "fullText": "The Hubble Tension is one of the great mysteries of cosmology. Solving it might require a fundamental change in how we understand the universe - but scientists have to prove it actually exists first. A new paper from a collective of cosmologist researchers known as the TDCOSMO Collaboration adds further fuel to that first with updated measurements of the “Late Universe” measurement of the Hubble Constant using gravitational lenses of quasars, which shows that the Tension might exist after all.\n\nSo what is the Hubble Constant, and why is there a “tension”? Cosmologists agree that the universe is expanding, and appears to be doing so at an increasing rate. They know this because, the farther away (and therefore farther back) you look in the universe, objects seem to be moving away from us at an increasing rate. However, depending on what method you use to find that rate, there are two different answers, which differ by about 10%.\n\nOne technique is to look using “Late Universe” objects, such as quasars that we can actively see with current telescopes. This gives a measurement of around 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec (about 3.3 million light years). In other words, for every megaparsec between us and an object, the speed at which it's moving away from us increases by 73 kilometers per second.\n\nThe other technique is to look at the “Early Universe” - primarily the Cosmic Microwave Background, which is some of the earliest light from the Universe. When measured using this technique, the value appears to be about 67 km per second per megaparsec.\n\nThat 6 km/s difference may not seem like much on a cosmological scale, but it has persisted through all attempts over past decades to reconcile it. And that likely means there’s something wrong with how we understand at least one of those measurements. Since they are based on our current standard model of the universe, that means that our standard model is wrong, and we need a new one. Hence the name the “Hubble tension”.\n\nSeveral research groups have suggested that there is no actual Hubble tension, and the discrepancy can be explained by errors in the data collection methods in one or the other of the methods. But this paper provides two nails in the coffin of that argument. First, it uses a different technique than the standard “distance ladder” traditionally used to measure Late Universe objects. Second, it uses some of the most modern data available for its calculations, and strongly aligns with the Late Universe values previously found, softening some of the argument that the tension only exists because of signal inaccuracies.\n\nTraditional methods of establishing the Late Universe method have relied on what cosmologists call the “local distance ladder”, where they measure distances to increasingly distant objects whose properties are thought to be well known, such as supernovae and Cepheid variables, which have a well known luminosity based on their spin rate. Using those values and searching throughout the observable universe for supernovae will baseline how bright a supernova should be, and what its spectral profile should look like. Calculating the redshift from those supernovae gives a value for the Hubble Constant that typically aligns with the Late Universe side.\n\nThe paper describes a technique completely separate from that method, though. They use a set of eight gravitational lenses that have a large galaxy passing in front of a quasar farther away from us in time. This creates a gravitational lens of the quasar - essentially recreating it in multiple separate “images”, each of which takes a slightly different path to get to Earth. The cosmologists could then measure differences in those images when a specific event happened to the quasar. By using the properties of the lensing galaxy, they could then estimate the different paths the light took to get to us - and therefore have an estimate of how the expansion of the universe is affecting its path.\n\nA critical feature of the paper is the use of highly accurate measurements of the movement of stars in the foreground galaxy to eliminate what cosmologists call the Mass-Sheet Degeneracy (MSD). MSD is used to describe how hard it is to differentiate the physical properties of a lensing galaxy from a “mass sheet” of just generic mass without any intricacies of a galaxy, which can dramatically mess up the calculation of the Hubble constant. Accounting for accurate “stellar kinematics” in the lensing galaxies allows the researchers to accurately interpret their weight, as the faster the stars within them are moving, the larger their mass must be. Advanced telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are critical enabling factors for those stellar kinematic equations, as previous data sets had been unable to resolve individual star movements in these massive, far-away galaxies.\n\nAfter all was said and done, and the researchers calculated their new number for the Hubble constant, it came out as 74.3 km/s/Mpc - almost exactly in line with Late Universe calculations. So even with a completely new method, and updated, more accurate data, they proved that the Late Universe measurements are indeed accurate, for their way of measuring. And, importantly, that they are statistically different from Early Universe measurements - therefore the Hubble Tension is real.\n\nWhile this work doesn’t offer any solution to it, it does offer further validation that it exists, and disproves some of the arguments that it is just an data artifact that would be resolved with better methods of data collection. Even using data from our most powerful telescopes, and a completely different calculation method, still shows there’s something fishy in cosmology. We just need some testable hypotheses, and likely a whole bunch more data collection time, to figure it out.\n\nUniversity of Tokyo / EurekaAlert - A speed camera for the universe\n\nTDCOSMO Collaboration et al. - TDCOSMO 2025: Cosmological constraints from strong lensing time delays\n\nUT - If The Supernova Standard Candle Is Wrong, It Could Solve The Hubble Tension\n\nUT - Is the Hubble Tension Starting to Go Away?",

    "title": "AI and the ironies of automation – Part 2",
    "description": "Some (well-known) consequences of AI automating work",
    "fullText": "In the previous post, we discussed several observations, Lisanne Bainbridge made in her much-noticed paper “The ironies of automation”, she published in 1983 and what they mean for the current “white-collar” work automation attempts leveraging LLMs and AI agents based on LLMs, still requiring humans in the loop. We stopped at the end of the first chapter, “Introduction”, of the paper.\n\nIn this post, we will continue with the second chapter, “Approaches to solutions”, and see what we can learn there.\n\nHowever, before we start: Some of the observations and recommendations made in the paper must be taken with a grain of salt when applying them to the AI-based automation attempts of today. When monitoring an industrial production plant, it is often a matter of seconds until a human operator must act if something goes wrong to avoid severe or even catastrophic accidents.\n\nTherefore, it is of the highest importance to design industrial control stations in a way that a human operator can recognize deviations and malfunctions as easily as possible and immediately trigger countermeasures. A lot of work is put into the design of all the displays and controls, like, e.g., the well-known emergency stop switch in a screaming red color that is big enough to be punched with a flat hand, fist or alike within a fraction of a second if needed.\n\nWhen it comes to AI-based solutions automating white-collar work, we usually do not face such critical conditions. However, this is not a reason to dismiss the observations and recommendations in the paper easily because, e.g.:\n\nIf we let this sink in (plus a few other aspects, I did not write down here but you most likely will add in your mind), we quickly come to the conclusion that also in our AI-related automation context humans are often expected to make quick decisions and act based on them, often under conditions that make it hard (if not impossible) to conduct any in-depth analysis.\n\nIf we then also take into account, that depending on the situation a wrong result produced by an AI solution which eluded the human operator may have severe consequences in the worst case (e.g., assume a major security incident due to a missed wrongdoing of the AI solution), the situation is not that far away anymore from the situation in an industrial plant’s control station.\n\nSummarizing, we surely need to add the necessary grain of salt, i.e., ask ourselves how strict the timing constraints in our specific setting are to avoid comparing apples and oranges in the worst case. However, in general we need to consider the whole range of possible settings which will – probably more often than we think – include that humans need to make decisions in a very short time under stressful conditions (which makes things more precarious).\n\nThis brings us immediately to Lisanne Bainbridge’s first recommendation:\n\nIn any situation where a low probability event must be noticed quickly then the operator must be given artificial assistance, if necessary even alarms on alarms.\n\nIn other words, the system must support the human operator as well as possible in detecting a problem, especially if it tends to occur rarely. It is a consequence of the “monitoring fatigue” problem we discussed in the previous post.\n\nDue to the learnings people have made, a lot of effort has been put into the design of the displays, the controls and also the alerting mechanisms of industrial production control stations, making sure the human operators can make their jobs as good, as stress-free and as reliable as possible.\n\nThe usual idea is that a single human controls a fleet of AI agents that are designed to do some kind of job, e.g., writing code. Sometimes, most agents are generic “workers”, orchestrated by some kind of supervisor that delegates parts of the work to the worker agents. Sometimes, the different agents are “specialists”, each for a certain aspect of the job to be done, that collaborate using some kind of choreography (or are also orchestrated by a supervisor). While the generic workers are easier to set up, the specialized workers usually produce more accurate results.\n\nBecause these AI-based agents sometimes produce errors, a human – in our example a software developer – needs to supervise the AI agent fleet and ideally intervenes before the AI agents do something they should not do. Therefore, the AI agents typically create a plan of what they intend to do first (which as a side effect also increases the likelihood that they do not drift off). Then, the human verifies the plan and approves it if it is correct, and the AI agents execute the plan. If the plan is not correct, the human rejects it and sends the agents back to replanning, providing information about what needs to be altered.\n\nLet us take Lisanne Bainbridge’s recommendation and compare it to this approach that is currently “best practice” to control an AI agent fleet.\n\nUnless we tell them to act differently, LLMs and also AI agents based on them are quite chatty. Additionally, they tend to communicate with an air of utter conviction. Thus, they present to you this highly detailed, multi-step plan of what they intend to do, including lots of explanations, in this perfectly convinced tone. Often, these plans are more than 50 or 100 lines of text, sometimes even several hundred lines.\n\nMost of the time, the plans are fine. However, sometimes the AI agents mess things up. They make wrong conclusions, or they forget what they are told to do and drift off – not very often, but it happens. Sometimes the problem is obvious at first sight. But more often, it is neatly hidden somewhere behind line 123: “… and because 2 is bigger than 3, it is clear, we need to < do something critical >”. But because it is so much text the agents flood you with all the time and because the error is hidden so well behind this wall of conviction, we miss it – and the AI agent does something critical wrong.\n\nWe cannot blame the person for missing the error in the plan. The problem is that this is probably the worst UI and UX possible for anyone who is responsible for avoiding errors in a system that rarely produces errors.\n\nBut LLM-based agents make errors all the time, you may say. Well, not all the time. Sometimes they do. And the better the instructions and the setup of the interacting agents, the fewer errors they produce. Additionally, we can expect more specialized and refined agents in the future that become increasingly better in their respective areas of expertise. Still, most likely they will never become completely error-free because of the underlying technology that cannot guarantee consistent correctness.\n\nThis is the setting we need to ponder if we talk about the user interface for a human observer: a setting where the agent fleet only rarely makes errors but we still need a human monitoring and intervening if things should go wrong. It is not yet clear how such an interface should look like, but most definitely not as it looks now. Probably we could harvest some good insights from our UX/UI design colleagues for industrial production plant control stations. We would need only to ask them …\n\nLisanne Bainbridge then makes several recommendations regarding the required training of the human operator. This again is a rich section, and I can only recommend reading it on your own because it contains several subtle yet important hints that are hard to bring across without citing the whole chapter. Here, I will highlight only a few aspects. She starts with:\n\n[Some points made in the previous section] make it clear that it can be important to maintain manual skills.\n\nThen she talks about letting the human operator take over control regularly, i.e., do the job instead of the machine as a very effective training option. Actually, without doing hands-on work regularly, the skills of a human expert deteriorate surprisingly fast.\n\nBut if taking over the work regularly is not an option, e.g., because we want continuous superhuman productivity leveraging AI agents (no matter if it makes sense or not), we still need to make sure that the human operator can take over if needed. In such a setting, training must take place in some other way, usually using some kind of simulator.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with simulators, especially if human intervention is only needed (and wanted) if things do not work as expected:\n\nThere are problems with the use of any simulator to train for extreme situations. Unknown faults cannot be simulated, and system behaviour may not be known for faults which can be predicted but have not been experienced.\n\nThe consequence of this issue is:\n\nThis means that training must be concerned with general strategies rather than specific responses […]\n\nIt is inadequate to expect the operator to react to unfamiliar events solely by consulting operating procedures. These cannot cover all the possibilities, so the operator is expected to monitor them and fill in the gaps.\n\nWhich leaves us with the irony:\n\nHowever, it is ironic to train operators in following instructions and then put them in the system to provide intelligence.\n\nThis is a problem we will need to face with AI agents and their supervising humans in the future, too. The supervising experts are meant to intervene whenever things become messy, whenever the AI agents get stuck, often in unforeseen ways. These are not regular tasks. Often, these are also not the issues we expect an AI agent to run into and thus can provide training for. These are extraordinary situations, the ones we do not expect – and the more refined and specialized the AI agents will become in the future, the more often the issues that require human intervention will be of this kind.\n\nThe questions seem to hint at a sort of paradox, and an answer to both questions is all but obvious. At the moment, we still have enough experienced subject matter experts that the questions may feel of lower importance. But if we only start to address the questions when they become pressing, they will be even harder – if not impossible – to solve.\n\nTo end this consideration with the words of Lisanne Bainbridge:\n\nPerhaps the final irony is that it is the most successful automated systems, with rare need for manual intervention, which may need the greatest investment in human operator training.\n\nIn other words, we cannot simply take a few available human experts and make them supervise agents that took over their work without any further investments in the humans. Instead, we need to train them continuously, and the better the agents become, the more expensive the training of the supervisors will become. I highly doubt that decision makers who primarily think about saving money when it comes to AI agents are aware of this irony.\n\nAs I wrote in the beginning of first part of this blog series, “The ironies of automation” is a very rich and dense paper. We are still only at the end of the second chapter “Approaches to solutions” which is two and a half pages into the paper and there is still a whole third chapter called “Human-computer collaboration” which takes up another page until we get to the conclusion.\n\nWhile this third chapter also contains a lot of valuable advice that goes well beyond our focus here, I will leave it to you to read it on your own. As I indicated at the beginning, this paper is more than worth the time spent on it.\n\nHowever, before finishing this little blog series, I would like to mention a new kind of dilemma that Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper because the situation was a bit different with industrial production plant automation than with AI-agent-based automation. But as this topic fits nicely into the just-finished training paradox section, I decided to add it here.\n\nThe issue is that just monitoring an AI agent fleet doing its work and intervening if things go wrong usually is not sufficient, at least not yet. All the things discussed before apply, but there is more to interacting with AI agents because we cannot simply be reactive with AI agents. We cannot simply watch them doing their work and only intervene if things go wrong. Instead, we additionally need to be proactive with them: We need to direct them.\n\nWe need to tell the AI agents what to do, what not to do, which chunks to pick and so on. This is basically a leadership role. While you do not lead humans, the kind of work is quite similar: You are responsible for the result; you are allowed to set directions and constraints, but you do not immediately control the work. You only control it through communicating with the agents and trying to direct them in the right direction with orders, with feedback, with changed orders, with setting different constraints, etcetera.\n\nThis is a skill set most people do not have naturally. Usually, they need to develop it over time. Typically, before people are put in a leadership role directing humans, they will get a lot of leadership training teaching them the skills and tools needed to lead successfully. For most people, this is essential because if they come from the receiving end of orders (in the most general sense of “orders”), typically they are not used to setting direction and constraints. This tends to be a completely new skill they need to learn.\n\nThis does not apply only to leading humans but also to leading AI agents. While AI agents are not humans, and thus leadership will be different in detail, the basic skills and tools needed are the same. This is, BTW, one of the reasons why the people who praise agentic AI on LinkedIn and the like are very often managers who lead (human) teams. For them, leading an AI agent fleet feels very natural because it is very close to the work they do every day. However, for the people currently doing the work, leading an AI agent fleet usually does not feel natural at all.\n\nHowever, I have not yet seen anyone receiving any kind of leadership training before being left alone with a fleet of AI agents, and I still see little discussion about the issue. “If it does not work properly, you need better prompts” is the usual response if someone struggles with directing agents successfully.\n\nSorry, but it is not that easy. The issue is much bigger than just optimizing a few prompts. The issue is that people have to change their approach completely to get any piece of work done. Instead of doing it directly, they need to learn how to get it done indirectly. They need to learn how to direct a group of AI agents effectively, how to lead them.\n\nThis also adds to the training irony of the previous topic. Maybe the AI agent fleets will become good enough in the future that we can omit the proactive part of the work and only need to focus on the reactive part of the work, the monitor-and-intervene part. But until then, we need to teach human supervisors of AI agent fleets how to lead them effectively.\n\nWe discussed several ironies and paradoxes from Lisanne Bainbridge’s “The ironies of automation” and how they also apply to agentic AI. We looked at the unlearning and recall dilemma and what it means for the next generation of human supervisors. We discussed monitoring fatigue and the status issue. We looked at the UX and UI deficiencies of current AI agents and the training paradox. And we finally looked at the leadership dilemma, which Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper but which complements the training paradox.\n\nI would like to conclude with the conclusion of Lisanne Bainbridge:\n\n[…] humans working without time-pressure can be impressive problem solvers. The difficulty remains that they are less effective when under time pressure. I hope this paper has made clear both the irony that one is not by automating necessarily removing the difficulties, and also the possibility that resolving them will require even greater technological ingenuity than does classic automation.\n\nI think over time we will become clear on how much “The ironies of automation” also applies to automation done with AI agents and that we cannot ignore the insights known for more than 40 years meanwhile. I am also really curious how the solutions to the ironies and paradoxes will look like.\n\nUntil then, I hope I gave you a bit of food for thought to ponder. If you should have some good ideas regarding the ironies and how to address them, please do not hesitate to share them with the community. We learn best by sharing and discussing, and maybe your contribution will be a step towards solving the issues discussed …",

    "title": "Vacuum Is a Lie: About Your Indexes",
    "description": "PostgreSQL VACUUM cleans tables but leaves indexes bloated. Learn why B-trees fragment and how to fix them properly.",
    "fullText": "There is common misconception that troubles most developers using PostgreSQL:\ntune VACUUM or run VACUUM, and your database will stay healthy. Dead tuples will\nget cleaned up. Transaction IDs recycled. Space reclaimed. Your database will\nlive happily ever after.\n\nBut there are couple of dirty \"secrets\" people are not aware of. First of them\nbeing VACUUM is lying to you about your indexes.\n\nWhen you delete a row in PostgreSQL, it is just marked as a 'dead tuple'.\nInvisible for new transactions but still physically present. Only when all\ntransactions referencing the row are finished, VACUUM can come along and actually\nremove them - reclamining the space in the heap (table) space.\n\nTo understand why this matters differently for tables versus indexes, you need\nto picture how PostgreSQL actually stores your data.\n\nYour table data lives in the heap - a collection of 8 KB pages where rows are\nstored wherever they fit. There's no inherent order. When you INSERT a row,\nPostgreSQL finds a page with enough free space and slots the row in. Delete a\nrow, and there's a gap. Insert another, and it might fill that gap - or not - they\nmight fit somewhere else entirely.\n\nThis is why SELECT * FROM users without an ORDER BY can return rows in order\ninitially, and after some updates in seemingly random order, and that order can\nchange over time. The heap is like Tetris. Rows drop into whatever space is\navailable, leaving gaps when deleted.\n\nWhen VACUUM runs, it removes those dead tuples and compacts the remaining\nrows within each page. If an entire page becomes empty, PostgreSQL can reclaim\nit entirely.\n\nAnd while indexes are on surface the same collection of 8KB pages, they are\ndifferent. A B-tree index must maintain sorted order - that's the\nwhole point of their existence and the reason why WHERE id = 12345 is so\nfast. PostgreSQL can binary-search down the tree instead of scanning every\npossible row. You can learn more about the fundamentals of B-Tree Indexes and\nwhat makes them fast.\n\nBut if the design of the indexes is what makes them fast, it's also their\nbiggest responsibility. While PostgreSQL can fit rows into whatever space is\navailable, it can't move the entries in index pages to fit as much as possible.\n\nVACUUM can remove dead index entries. But it doesn't restructure the B-tree.\nWhen VACUUM processes the heap, it can compact rows within a page and reclaim\nempty pages. The heap has no ordering constraint - rows can be anywhere. But\nB-tree pages? They're locked into a structure. VACUUM can remove dead index\nentries, yes.\n\nMany developers assume VACUUM treats all pages same. No matter whether they are\nheap or index pages. VACUUM is supposed to remove the dead entries, right?\n\nYes. But here's what it doesn't do - it doesn't restructure the B-tree.\n\nYour heap is Tetris, gaps can get filled. Your B-tree is a sorted bookshelf.\nVACUUM can pull books out, but can't slide the remaining ones together. You're\nleft walking past empty slots every time you scan.\n\nLet's get hands-on and create a table, fill it, delete most of it and watch what happens.\n\nAt this point, our index is healthy. Let's capture the baseline:\n\nNow remove some data, 80% to be precise - somewhere in the middle:\n\nThe goal is to simulate a common real-world pattern: data retention policies,\nbulk cleanup operations, or the aftermath of a data migration gone wrong.\n\nThe table shrunk significantly, while index remained unchanged. You now have\n20,000 rows indexed by a structure build to handle 100,000. Please, also notice\nfile_size remain unchanged. VACUUM doesn't return space to the OS, it only\nmarks pages as reusable within PostgreSQL.\n\nThis experiment is really an extreme case, but demonstrates the problem.\n\nLeaf pages have several states:\n\nFull page (>80% density), when the page contains many index entries,\nefficiently utilizing space. Each 8KB page read returns substantial useful data.\nThis is optimal state.\n\nPartial page (40-80% density) with some wasted space, but still reasonably\nefficient. Common at tree edges or after light churn. Nothing to be worried about.\n\nSparse page (<40% density) is mostly empty. You're reading an 8KB page to\nfind a handful of entries. The I/O cost is the same as a full page, but you get\nfar less value.\n\nEmpty page (0% density) with zero live entries, but the page still exists in\nthe tree structure. Pure overhead. You might read this page during a range scan\nand find absolutely nothing useful.\n\nYou might be wondering how can fillfactor help with this? It's the setting you\ncan apply both for heap and leaf pages, and controls how full PostgreSQL packs the\npages during the data storage. The default value for B-tree indexes is 90%. This\nleaves 10% of free space on each leaf page for future insertions.\n\nA lower fillfactor (like 70%) leaves more room, which can reduce page splits\nwhen you're inserting into the middle of an index - useful for tables random index\ncolumn inserts or those with heavily updated index columns.\n\nBut if you followed carefully the anatomy of storage section, it doesn't help\nwith the bloat problem. Quite the oppossite. If you set lower fillfactor and then\ndelete majority of your rows, you actually start with more pages, and bigger\nchance to end up with more sparse pages than partial pages.\n\nLeaf page fillfactor is about optimizing for updates and inserts. It's not a\nsolution for deletion or index-column update bloat.\n\nPostgreSQL's query planner estimates costs based on physical\nstatistics, including the number of pages in an index.\n\nWhile the execution is almost instant, you need to look behind the scenes. The\nplanner estimated 200 rows and got zero. It traversed the B-tree structure\nexpecting data that doesn't exist. On a single query with warm cache, this is\ntrivial. Under production load with thousands of queries and cold pages,\nyou're paying I/O cost for nothing. Again and again.\n\nIf you dig further you discover much bigger problem.\n\nThe relpages value comes from the physical file size divided by the 8 KB page\nsize. PostgreSQL updates it during VACUUM and ANALYZE, but it reflects the\nactual file on disk - not how much useful data is inside. Our index file is still\n2.2 MB (276 pages × 8 KB), even though most pages are empty.\n\nThe planner sees 276 pages for 20,000 rows and calculates a very low\nrows-per-page ratio. This is when planner can come to conclusion - this index\nis very sparse - let's do a sequential scan instead. Oops.\n\n\"But wait,\" you say, \"doesn't ANALYZE fix statistics?\"\n\nYes and no. ANALYZE updates the row count estimate. It will no longer think you\nhave 100,000 rows but 20,000. But it does not shrink relpages, because that\nreflects the physical file size on disk. ANALYZE can't change that.\n\nThe planner now has accurate row estimates but wildly inaccurate page estimates.\nThe useful data is packed into just ~57 pages worth of entries, but the planner\ndoesn't know that.\n\nWe can dig even more into the index problem when we look at internal stats:\n\nWait, what? The avg_leaf_density is 86% and it looks perfectly healthy. That's a\ntrap. Due to the hollow index (we removed 80% right in the middle) we have 57\nwell-packed leaf pages, but the index still contains 217 deleted pages.\n\nThis is why avg_leaf_density alone is misleading. The density of used pages\nlooks great, but 79% of your index file is dead weight.\n\nThe simplest way to spot index bloat is comparing actual size to expected size.\n\nA bloat_ratio of 2.8 means the index is nearly 3x larger than expected. Anything\nabove 1.8 - 2.0 deserves investigation.\n\nWe filter to indexes over 1 MB - bloat on tiny indexes doesn't matter that much.\nPlease, adjust the threshold based on your environment; for large databases, you\nmight only care about indexes over 100 MB.\n\nBut here comes BIG WARNING: pgstatindex() we used earlier physically reads\nthe entire index. On a 10 GB index, that's 10 GB of I/O. Don't run it against\nall indexes on a production server - unless you know what you are doing!\n\nHow to actually fix index bloat problem? REINDEX is s straightforward solution as\nit rebuilds the index from scratch.\n\nAfter which we can check the index health:\n\nOur index shrunk from 2.2 MB to 456 KB - 79% reduction (not a big surprise\nthough).\n\nAs you might have noticed we have used CONCURRENTLY to avoid using ACCESS\nEXCLUSIVE lock. This is available since PostgreSQL 12+, and while there's an\noption to omit it - the pretty much only reason to do so is during planned\nmaintenance to speed up the index rebuild time.\n\nIf you look above at the file_size of our relations, we have managed to reclaim\nthe disk space for the affected index (it was REINDEX after all), but the table\nspace was not returned back to the operating system.\n\nThat's where pg_squeeze\nshines. Unlike trigger-based alternatives, pg_squeeze uses logical decoding,\nresulting in lower impact on your running system. It rebuilds both the table and\nall its indexes online, with minimal locking:\n\nThe exclusive lock is only needed during the final swap phase, and its duration\ncan be configured. Even better, pg_squeeze is designed for regular automated\nprocessing - you can register tables and let it handle maintenance whenever bloat\nthresholds are met.\n\npg_squeeze makes sense when both table and indexes are bloated, or when you want\nautomated management. REINDEX CONCURRENTLY is simpler when only indexes need\nwork.\n\nThere's also older tool pg_repack - for a deeper comparison of bloat-busting\ntools, see article The Bloat Busters: pg_repack vs\npg_squeeze.\n\nVACUUM FULL rewrites the entire table and all indexes. While it fixes\neverything it comes with a big but - it requires an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE\nlock - completely blocking all reads and writes for the entire duration. For a\nlarge table, this could mean hours of downtime.\n\nGenerally avoid this in production. Use pg_squeeze instead for the same\nresult without the downtime.\n\nBefore you now go and REINDEX everything in sight, let's talk about when index\nbloat actually matters.\n\nB-trees expand and contract with your data. With random insertions affecting\nindex columns - UUIDs, hash keys, etc. the page splits happen constantly. Index\nefficiency might get hit at occassion and also settle around 70 - 80% over\ndifferent natural cycles of your system usage. That's not bloat. That's the tree\nfinding its natural shape for your data.\n\nThe bloat we demonstrated - 57 useful pages drowning in 217 deleted ones - is\nextreme. It came from deleting 80% of contiguous data. You won't see this\nfrom normal day to day operations.\n\nWhen do you need to act immediately:\n\nBut in most cases you don't have to panic. Monitor weekly and when indexes bloat\nratio continously grow above warning levels, schedule a REINDEX CONCURRENTLY\nduring low traffic period.\n\nIndex bloat isn't an emergency until it is. Know the signs, have the tools\nready, and don't let VACUUM's silence fool you into thinking everything's fine.\n\nVACUUM is essential for PostgreSQL. Run it. Let autovacuum do its job. But\nunderstand its limitations: it cleans up dead tuples, not index structure.\n\nThe truth about PostgreSQL maintenance is that VACUUM handles heap bloat\nreasonably well, but index bloat requires explicit intervention. Know when your\nindexes are actually sick versus just breathing normally - and when to reach for\nREINDEX.\n\nVACUUM handles heap bloat. Index bloat is your problem. Know the difference.",

Michael admitted he spends freely on electronics and has never planned financially.\n\nSethi said their pattern reflects a parent-child dynamic that develops when one partner manages most responsibilities and the other disengages. He added that the strain often affects trust and communication. The couple said they tried multiple budgeting systems and coaching sessions over the years, yet none produced lasting change.\n\nImani said the debt makes her \"want to cry and scream and fight,\" and added she is angry at Michael and herself.\n\nWhen Sethi asked whether Michael believed he would die with debt, he replied that avoiding that outcome \"is going to be a stretch.\" At one point, Imani considered walking out of the house with her youngest son because she felt exhausted by the financial pressure.\n\nTrending: Have $100k+ to invest?

He also described impulsive purchases, including buying vehicles during major life events.\n\nImani grew up in a household defined by budgeting and saving.

    "fullText": "Ever wonder which brand-new cars are gathering dust on dealer lots across America? iSeeCars did a deep dive into more than 2.6 million new car listings across the United States, revealing some surprising answers.\n\nThe data shows the percentage of 2024 inventory still sitting unsold, and the results paint an interesting picture of what today's buyers are actually looking for. From luxury SUVs to sports cars, these twelve models are having a tougher time finding homes than dealers probably anticipated.\n\nSome of the names might surprise you, while others make perfect sense once you consider pricing, timing, and market trends.\n\nLeading the pack with a staggering 82% of inventory still available, the Dodge Hornet plug-in hybrid is struggling to find its audience. This compact crossover arrived with plenty of expectations, bringing electrification to the Dodge lineup in an unexpected package.\n\nThe pricing sits in an awkward middle ground where buyers shopping for practicality might opt for less expensive options, while performance enthusiasts may not see the Hornet as a true Dodge muscle vehicle. The plug-in hybrid powertrain adds complexity and cost that many shoppers in this segment simply aren't asking for.\n\nIt's a challenging market position when your brand identity is built on roaring V8s and quarter-mile times.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee has long been a cornerstone of Jeep's lineup, but more than 70% of 2024 models remain unsold at an average price above $64,000. That price point puts it in direct competition with luxury European SUVs that offer prestigious badges and refined experiences.\n\nThe midsize SUV market is fiercely competitive, especially at this price point where buyers have dozens of well-established two-row luxury and near-luxury options to choose from. Jeep's recent quality perception issues haven't helped matters, as buyers spending this much want assurance their investment will be reliable.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee remains capable and spacious, but convincing buyers to choose it over established luxury competitors at this price requires a compelling value proposition.\n\nAlfa Romeo's entry into the compact luxury crossover segment has met a lukewarm reception, with nearly half of the 2024 Tonale Hybrid inventory still available. The Italian brand brings undeniable style and driving dynamics, but the hybrid powertrain in a segment where buyers often prioritize either pure efficiency or pure performance creates an identity challenge.\n\nAt almost $52,000, shoppers have access to well-established German competitors with stronger dealer networks and better resale values. The Tonale looks fantastic and drives with characteristic Alfa flair, but breaking into the American market with limited brand presence remains an uphill battle.\n\nEnthusiasts love what Alfa Romeo represents, though convincing mainstream luxury buyers to take the leap is another story entirely.\n\nThe Malibu's struggles reflect a broader trend: the American sedan is facing an existential crisis. With 31% of inventory unsold, this dependable midsize sedan is caught in a market that has decisively shifted toward SUVs and crossovers.\n\nChevrolet has already announced the Malibu's discontinuation, which certainly doesn't help sales as buyers tend to avoid models they know are being phased out. The pricing is reasonable and the Malibu offers solid value with good fuel economy and a comfortable ride.\n\nHowever, when most buyers can get into a Chevy Trax or Trailblazer for similar money with the added versatility of a crossover, the traditional sedan becomes a tougher sell.\n\nThe non-hybrid Dodge Hornet appears again, this time the base model with 26% of inventory still on lots. At nearly $32,000, this Alfa Romeo Tonale-based crossover faces an identity crisis within the Dodge lineup.\n\nTraditional Dodge buyers expect American muscle and V8 rumble, not a turbocharged four-cylinder Italian-rooted crossover. The Hornet offers decent performance and modern features, but it doesn't fit the brand's muscle car image that draws customers to showrooms. Meanwhile, buyers simply looking for a compact crossover have dozens of more established options to choose from.\n\nDodge is attempting to pivot toward a more diverse lineup, though this transition is proving challenging when your brand loyalty is built on a very specific type of vehicle.\n\nWhen your average transaction price approaches six figures, you're competing with some serious luxury iron. The Grand Wagoneer L stretches the already-large Grand Wagoneer even further, creating a true land yacht for families who need maximum space.\n\nAt over $92,000, buyers at this level expect Range Rover levels of refinement and prestige, which represents a significant leap for the Jeep brand. The Grand Wagoneer L offers impressive capability and generous three-row seating, but the price tag puts it in rarefied air where badge perception matters enormously.\n\nJeep has made tremendous strides in luxury execution, yet convincing ultra-luxury buyers to choose a Jeep over established European competitors remains a formidable challenge.\n\nGenesis continues working to establish itself in the American luxury market, and the electric GV60 crossover exemplifies both the brand's potential and its challenges. With nearly 22% of inventory unsold, this stylish EV offers distinctive design and impressive technology at a price point below comparable European EVs.\n\nThe challenge is brand awareness and dealer network size, as Genesis simply doesn't have the visibility or accessibility of established luxury brands. The GV60 delivers genuine luxury and engaging driving dynamics in an eye-catching package.\n\nHowever, when spending nearly $58,000 on an electric vehicle, many buyers gravitate toward Tesla's established Supercharger network or prestigious German alternatives with decades of luxury credibility.\n\nThe legendary Charger's presence on this list might seem surprising given its cult following, but at nearly $60,000 average price, we're looking at well-equipped or performance variants. The Charger has enjoyed an incredible run as one of the last V8-powered sedan options, yet the transition to electric power looms on the horizon.\n\nBuyers interested in the traditional Charger experience may be waiting for deals as inventory clears, while those interested in the upcoming electric version are simply waiting for its arrival. The pricing also reflects how expensive these muscle sedans have become, potentially pricing out some traditional buyers.\n\nThe Charger remains an automotive icon, though this transitional moment creates uncertainty in the marketplace.\n\nThe reborn Z sports car brought tremendous excitement when it launched, combining retro-inspired styling with modern performance. However, with nearly 19% of inventory unsold at an average price above $53,000, the market reality for two-seater sports cars is challenging.\n\nThis price point puts the Z in competition with the Toyota Supra, Chevrolet Corvette, and various European sports cars that offer different flavors of performance. The Z delivers fantastic driving dynamics and that classic long-hood proportions that enthusiasts love, but sports car sales volumes are inherently limited.\n\nAdditionally, the automatic-only NISMO trim disappointed some purists, even though manual transmissions remain available on other Z trims.\n\nThe Wrangler 4xe brings electrification to Jeep's most iconic nameplate, yet 18% of inventory remains unsold at an eye-watering average of nearly $61,000. This price reflects the technology premium for the plug-in hybrid system, pushing the Wrangler into luxury vehicle territory.\n\nTraditional Wrangler buyers often prioritize simplicity and proven off-road capability, while the added complexity of a PHEV system may not align with how they use their vehicles. The 4xe actually offers impressive off-road benefits with instant electric torque and silent running capability, plus daily driving efficiency that traditional Wranglers can't match.\n\nHowever, convincing buyers to spend this much on a Wrangler requires demonstrating clear advantages over the less expensive conventional powertrains.\n\nHyundai's electrified Tucson represents a logical evolution of the popular compact crossover, though 14% of PHEV inventory remains available. At over $45,000, the plug-in hybrid commands a significant premium over the regular Tucson, which already offers excellent value and features.\n\nBuyers interested in electrification at this price point have numerous options, including fully electric vehicles that eliminate gas stations entirely. The Tucson PHEV makes sense for drivers who want electric-only commuting capability with gas backup for longer trips, though that specific use case represents a smaller slice of the market.\n\nHyundai's rapid advancement in quality and technology is impressive, yet the price premium for plug-in capability remains a hurdle for value-conscious crossover shoppers.\n\nThe standard-length Grand Wagoneer rounds out our list with 13% of inventory unsold at an average price approaching $84,000. Jeep's flagship SUV aims to reclaim the brand's heritage of premium American utility vehicles with genuine luxury appointments.\n\nThe execution is impressive with high-quality materials, advanced technology, and commanding road presence that makes a statement. Yet at this price, buyers comparison shop against well-established luxury SUVs from brands with long histories of premium vehicle production.\n\nThe Grand Wagoneer succeeds in offering Jeep capability with upscale execution, though breaking into the established luxury SUV market requires time for brand perception to catch up with product reality.\n\nThis inventory analysis reveals some clear patterns about today's automotive market. Plug-in hybrids face an uphill battle as buyers increasingly choose either conventional powertrains or fully electric vehicles, skipping the middle ground entirely.\n\nPremium pricing pushes vehicles into competitive territory where brand perception and established luxury credentials matter enormously. The data also shows that even beloved nameplates like the Wrangler and Charger face sales challenges when configurations push prices into unexpected territory.\n\nThese inventory levels don't necessarily indicate bad vehicles, but rather misalignments between product offerings, pricing, and what buyers are actually seeking in today's market.",

    "fullText": "Iceland has sounded the alarm regarding the potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, declaring it a national security risk that requires its immediate attention.\n\nAs reported by Reuters, officials in Iceland are warning that the collapse of the AMOC could lead to a modern ice age scenario in Northern Europe. This would result in plummeting temperatures, increased snowfall and ice accumulation, and the potential destabilization of weather patterns across the world.\n\nNot only would this harm the agriculture industry and vulnerable ecosystems in Europe, but other regions could also face an existential threat due to far-reaching and severe climate impacts.\n\n\"It is a direct threat to our national resilience and security,\" said Iceland Climate Minister Johann Pall Johannsson in an email, per Reuters. \"[This] is the first time a specific climate-related phenomenon has been formally brought before the National Security Council as a potential existential threat.\"\n\nAccording to the Integrated Carbon Observation System, the AMOC is a crucial component of our global climate, transporting heat from the tropics to the North Atlantic, helping keep Europe's climate balanced and relatively mild. It also distributes nutrients essential for marine life and plays a significant role in the global distribution of heat, salt, and carbon.\n\nHowever, rising global temperatures have threatened to completely disrupt the AMOC. The addition of massive amounts of freshwater into the North Atlantic, mainly from melting ice sheets, glaciers, and increased precipitation, is directly linked to warmer global temperatures.\n\nA slowdown in the AMOC could lead to more extreme weather events in some regions around the globe, while triggering extended droughts in others. This could result in a devastating blow to local agriculture industries that may jeopardize food security for millions of people.\n\nIn an effort to slow the continued rise of global temperatures and prevent the melting of Arctic glaciers and ice sheets, many countries have enacted policies to reduce their reliance on planet-heating fossil fuels. Other initiatives look to promote the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.\n\n\"The science is evolving quite rapidly and time is running out to do anything about it because the tipping point may well be quite close,\" said oceanographer and climatologist Stefan Rahmstorf, per Reuters.\n\nIceland's national security risk designation of the potential collapse of the AMOC allows the country's government to develop worst-case scenario plans. This may buy them valuable time to put proactive measures in place while safeguarding vulnerable industries.\n\n\"Sea ice could affect marine transport; extreme weather could severely affect our capabilities to maintain any agriculture and fisheries, which are central to our economy and food systems,\" added Johannsson, according to Reuters. \"We cannot afford to wait for definitive, long-term research before acting.\"\n\nShould we be harnessing the ocean to power our homes?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The sheriff claims that Rittenhouse is trying to make money off an incident in his county.",
    "fullText": "Kyle Rittenhouse returned to social media this week, and he is already drawing the ire of at least one sheriff in Florida.\n\nRittenhouse, who shot three people, killing two, during a racial injustice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 2020, claimed self-defense and was acquitted of all charges. He remains controversial, though, and his new gig appears to be attempting to call out incidents that he believes are Second Amendment issues.\n\nThat led him to share a video on Friday standing in front of the Walton County Jail while claiming that Michael Rediker “used Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ law to lawfully defend himself when his life was put in jeopardy.”\n\n“Michael did nothing wrong, and he deserves all our support,” Rittenhouse said in the video which he pinned to his X page.\n\n“We are expecting an outright not guilty under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law,” he added.\n\nWalton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson did not take kindly to Rittenhouse’s claims. He reshared the video via the Walton County Sheriff Office’s official X account, and issued a video of his own scathing response.\n\n“I don’t normally do this,” Adkinson said. “I don’t normally take the time to speak to public comments on cases, certainly not open cases. But in this particular situation, a murder that occurred yesterday in Walton County, I feel compelled to respond to what I can only call wildly irresponsible. I would say motivated by many factors, none of them in the interest of justice in which individuals, particularly Kyle Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, are attempting to frame the murder here in Walton County on Thursday of Mr. Keen as a Stand Your Ground case or wrapping it in the Constitution or that it is Second Amendment case.”\n\n“After 30-something years of doing this, I very rarely get personally offended, but I’m actually just kind of disgusted with them,” the sheriff continued. “There was a man who lost his life yesterday. A father, a husband with two small children, who was murdered, unarmed on his own property, unprovoked by an individual who drove a tractor over a half a mile onto the victim’s property. Once there, batters his wife in front of eyewitnesses. When the husband, whom there had been no confrontation with, gets out to come over and help pick his wife up off the ground the suspect shoots him in the face. He was unarmed. There was no fight between them. There was no attack, and as he is laying dying on the ground, this suspect, Michael Rediker, stood over him and made some comments for which he is going to answer to in court. At the same time, he committed aggravated assault on multiple other people because he murdered this man in front of witnesses that watched this as this man was murdered. Again, unarmed, on his own property, after his wife had been battered, and no confrontation.\n\n“Now, somehow out of that, Mr. Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, have determined that this is the great Stand Your Ground case,” Adkinson continued. “Well, I’ll tell you this. I’ll bet my badge on this. Not only is that not a stand your ground, Mr. Rediker will face either the ultimate penalty in the state of Florida or God willing the rest of his natural life in prison. Because, come Christmas morning in two weeks, there are two little boys elementary school age, two children, that are not going to have their father, and there’s a wife whose not going to have her husband all so these two idiots can get more likes on their Facebook and call it a Constitutional issue.”\n\n“I’m actually just disgusted with @rittenhouse2a and @AnthonySabatini. A man lost his life yesterday. A father. A husband. With two small children. Who was murdered, unarmed, on his own property unprovoked by an individual who drove a tractor a half a mile onto the victim’s… https://t.co/HQbexbApzO pic.twitter.com/y6t7lGMKOd\n\n— Walton County Sheriff's Office, Florida (@WCSOFL) December 13, 2025\n\n“I think both of you are jokes, and I don’t think you should make a damn cent off the suffering of someone else,” he said. “So, if you don’t like that, well you can file that under I don’t really give a damn. I know people aren’t’ going to like this, and I don’t care about that either. I’m so disgusted and sad for the Keen family and their loss and the fact that these two yo-yos are going to try to make money and news on it. And I probably shouldn’t give them this, but I think the public deserves to know this doesn’t have a damn thing to do with the Second Amendment or Stand Your Ground. So, I hope that many of you will reach out and tell these two jack-wagons what you think about what they are doing to this family suffering.\n\n“Don’t let them make on penny off a like.”\n\nWMBB reported that Rediker, 44, was arrested on Thursday and charged with one count of open murder, battery, and three counts of aggravated battery.\n\nRittenhouse made headlines this week when he returned to social media after leaving in June and sharing some big news.\n\n“I’m back on social media, I’m back in the fight, and I’m here to stay,” he wrote on X alongside a pair of photos of himself with a girl.\n\nHe then explained what that was all about.\n\n“For a quick update, 6 months ago I made the best decision of my life and married my best friend,” he wrote. “(Bella Rittenhouse), I couldn’t be happier. I love you beautiful.”\n\nShe replied back, “I love you!”\n\nOne of his followers replied, “Couldn’t be happier for you Kyle. To have your entire world upended and fight through it. Dude, that’s awesome.”\n\n“I’m still being sued for $20 million,” Rittenhouse replied. “But thankfully the Lord provides.”\n\nRittenhouse made several more posts during the day, including one where he said that the assassination of Charlie Kirk convinced him he “couldn’t sit on the sidelines anymore.”\n\n“So I’m back,” he wrote. “Not quietly. Not halfway. I’m coming back in a big way.”",

These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients’ Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nChenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida’s college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals that are frequently under-resourced and under-staffed. They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.\n\nPhysicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nA recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians, but worse than those of expert physicians. Tan said that it’s important to take context – like frequent physician burnout in rural hospitals – into account when evaluating risks and benefits.\n\n“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.\n\n“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.\n\nThe FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.\n\nWhile Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.\n\n“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.\n\nBut this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.\n\n“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.",

    "description": "So what exactly is a QCD and how does it work?",
    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor many retirees, the holiday season is the perfect time to give back. And there’s one IRS-approved trick that can make that generosity go even further.\n\nA qualified charitable distribution, or QCD, is a direct donation from your IRA that can shrink your tax bill while helping your favorite charity.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“It’s one of the IRS’ best-kept secrets for retirees,” Ashton Lawrence, a certified financial planner at Mariner Wealth Advisors in Greenville, South Carolina, told CNBC (1).\n\nSo what exactly is a QCD and how does it work?\n\nA qualified charitable distribution is a direct transfer from your pretax IRA to a qualified charity. Instead of withdrawing the money and then donating it, which counts as taxable income because it impacts your adjusted gross income (AGI), you send it straight from your IRA and keep it off your tax return entirely.\n\nAccording to Fidelity, QCDs are most optimal for retirees who are 70½ or older and taking required minimum distributions (RMDs), who don’t itemize deductions and have IRA balances that are typically mid–six figures or higher. Retirees with smaller IRAs can still benefit, but the tax impact may be less dramatic (2).\n\nFor 2025, retirees aged 70½ or older can donate up to $108,000 this way, according to the IRS (3). Married couples can each give up to that limit if both spouses qualify. Thanks to the Secure Act 2.0, that cap now adjusts for inflation every year.\n\nThe majority of Americans, 91% of filers, according to the IRS, take the standard deduction instead of itemizing (4). While some chose not to itemize because it legitimately yields a larger deduction, others opt for this route because it tends to be easier. That means their regular charitable donations don’t actually lower their taxable income.\n\nThere’s no deduction because the money is simply excluded from income, which is “better than a deduction,” according to Juan Ros, CFP and partner at Forum Financial Management in Thousand Oaks, California (1).\n\nIf you’re 73 or older, you have to start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your pretax retirement accounts, whether you need the cash or not. Skip it, and the IRS hits you with a penalty.",

    "description": "With seller financing, the seller acts as the lender, typically providing their buyer with a short-term home loan.",
    "fullText": "Carson Austin began to worry after his home had been sitting on the market for a couple of months with barely any interest from potential buyers.\n\nIt was early 2025, and he had listed the 4,600-square-foot Georgetown, Texas, property for $1.6 million, which he thought was a competitive price, comparable to other large homes in the area. But mortgage rates were hovering around 7%, keeping buyers out of the market and sales stagnant.\n\nSo Austin decided to try something a bit unconventional. He offered seller financing — an agreement in which the seller acts as the lender, typically providing the buyer with a short-term home loan. In Austin's case, he held firm on the home's sale price, but offered a below-market interest rate to entice buyers.\n\nAs soon as he offered the creative financing option, interest picked up. Within two days, the house was under contract with a buyer who agreed to a 35% down payment and a six-year seller-financed loan with a 4% interest rate. The sale closed just days later. Austin worked with a firm, MORE Seller Financing, to facilitate the deal, vetting and approving the buyer, and structuring the transaction with the help of lawyers and other specialists.\n\nAustin said his buyer only came to see his house because of the below-market interest rate.\n\n\"I 100% know that the only reason that house sold, especially in that timeframe, was the owner financing — they told us that,\" he said.\n\nSeller or owner financing gained popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, when interest rates were sky-high, but it developed a bad reputation for lacking sufficient protections, particularly for buyers. Federal regulators have criticized the model for exploiting low-income buyers with high interest rates on low-quality homes in poor neighborhoods.\n\nHowever, as mortgage rates have soared since 2022, the creative financing strategy has regained popularity, despite remaining a niche offering. The practice is increasingly common in higher-end home sales, according to Realtor.com. Sales involving seller financing grew by 8% in dollar volume to more than $30 billion between 2023 and 2024, according to Note Investor.\n\n\"This used to be kind of a sketchy thing that happened with really cheap properties and really under-qualified buyers, and now the median price is on par with what's on the market as a whole,\" said Joel Berner, a senior economist at Realtor.com. \"So it's moving upmarket, becoming more widespread, happening on higher dollar properties.\"\n\nSeller financing often appeals to buyers who want a below-market interest rate or who are struggling to qualify for a traditional mortgage. The so-called bridge loan from the seller, typically lasting about three years, provides the buyer with time to wait for rates to come down and find a traditional mortgage. Meanwhile, sellers can get an edge in the market and benefit from earning interest on the loan.\n\nSellers often use the financing strategy to market a home that isn't selling. Both buyers and sellers can benefit from a quicker timeline and can avoid fees, including mortgage origination and appraisal costs.\n\n\"At its best, seller financing creates genuine win-wins,\" said Ryan Leahy, who founded MORE Seller Financing. \"Sellers often preserve more equity and earn predictable income, while qualified buyers benefit from payments that can be meaningfully below market rates.\"\n\nBut the practice can be financially and legally risky without the right protections. Leahy conceded that seller financing can have \"lots of pitfalls and risk if it's not done right.\" He argued that his firm helps protect both parties by educating them about the process, ensuring the agreement is in compliance with the law, and connecting them with all the specialists they need, including residential mortgage loan originators, lawyers, title companies, and other servicers.\n\nIt's more popular with wealthier people in part because the transaction \"requires financial stability and liquidity of the seller,\" Berner said, while the buyer needs \"to be able to either change what's keeping them from getting a mortgage in three to five years, or rates to come down considerably in three to five years.\"\n\nBut while the financing type has gained popularity, it remains a niche practice. Less than 1% of home listings mention private financing, Berner said.\n\nMORE deals with higher-end homes — typically valued between $800,000 and $3 million, Leahy said. Sellers typically have a fair amount of cash and equity in their property, allowing them to wait several years before receiving the full cash from their home sale. MORE's approved buyers are often self-employed with income that can be challenging to account for, making it more difficult to qualify for a mortgage.\n\n\"There's so many people out there self-employed or have income that doesn't qualify for a traditional mortgage, meaning you have influencer income, crypto income, side hustle income,\" Leahy said. \"Seller financing isn't going away.\"\n\nWhen another of MORE's clients turned to seller financing to sell his multi-million dollar Austin, Texas, home, he realized that his potential buyers faced a different conundrum. They could afford to buy a home all-cash, but preferred to invest their money elsewhere, avoiding high interest rates.\n\nJames S., who requested partial anonymity to protect his privacy, eventually sold his 5,200-square-foot house for $2.9 million in January 2025, providing the buyer with a three-year loan at a 5.5% interest rate.\n\n\"It's always that question: pay cash for a house or use that money for other things,\" he said. \"People could take the money, and they could go invest in the stock market, they could do other business ventures.\"\n\nJames and his wife also didn't need all the cash from their home sale immediately. They haven't bought a new home yet and are instead living in furnished short-term rentals in California as they figure out their next steps.\n\n\"My mortgage is being paid down,\" James said. \"And we make some money per month as well, so that's also good.\"",

    "description": "Snacking on junk food can disrupt your diet even if you eat healthy meals. A nutritionist recommends her favorite healthy snacks for lasting energy.",
    "fullText": "Eating more snacks can make it easier to stay on track with a healthy diet, according to a top nutritionist — if you pick the right kind of snacks.\n\nResearcher Federica Amati said smart snacking has been a game-changer for her personal eating habits on a busy schedule.\n\n\"If I've got a really busy day, sometimes I don't get time to have a proper lunch. If I have these snacks with me, I'm good and I'm feeling good. If I don't, then I'm ravenous later,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAmati, medical scientist and head nutritionist at the nutrition app ZOE, has also seen the power of snacking first-hand in her work.\n\nEven if you're careful with most of your diet, snacking on junk food can leave you struggling with metabolic health issues like weight gain, low energy, high cholesterol and high blood sugar, she said. That's backed up by research from ZOE and other experts.\n\n\"Crappy snacks can basically outdo a lot of the greatness you are doing for yourself with good food,\" Amati said. \"Snacking per se isn't good or bad for you, but what you snack on has a massive influence on your metabolic health.\"\n\nShe shared the two foods she always carries for a nutrient-dense boost, and how to optimize your snacking routine for a healthier diet.\n\nAmati's go-to snack combination at work is an apple and a small jar of mixed nuts.\n\nThe pairing of fruit and nuts offers gut-healthy fiber, plant-based protein, and healthy fats — all satiating nutrients that tell your brain you're full.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be some sort of chef situation,\" Amati said.\"It's just about having a very different mentality to snacking. If you are hungry, eat something that's a food.\"\n\nWhat's key is that you reach for whole foods. If you snack on ultra-processed foods, like a granola bar loaded with additives like sugar, fat, and salt, it's easy to overeat.\n\nWhy? Because the nutrients in ultra-processed foods are already broken down, leaving you with less to digest. So, they offer a temporary energy fix but leave you crashing afterward, often leading to overindulgence at your next meal or snack.\n\n\"It's nutritionally pretty void. So though you may temporarily not be so ravenous, your body's not benefiting from it, and your hunger will remain later that day,\" Amati said.\n\nPlus, the benefit of Amati's fruit-and-nuts snack is that it's relatively inexpensive and requires zero prep: just grab and go.\n\nThe specifics aren't crucial — you can make a healthy snack from fruits like berries and other nuts and seeds, from almonds to pepitas.\n\nWhatever you choose to snack on, being proactive about your hunger cues can lead to better results, according to Amati.\n\nEating early helps you stay in tune with your circadian rhythm to feel consistently energized and make better choices throughout the day.\n\n\"We're primed to more efficiently deal with nutrients and with energy storage and distribution from fats or sugars at the beginning of the day,\" she said.\n\nSkimping on early meals and snacks can leave you so hungry by dinner that you double-down on dessert or late-night snacking, often with less-healthy choices.\n\nWhile timing your snacks can be a matter of personal preference, eating when you're hungry but not hangry can stave off temptations for a more balanced diet.\n\n\"You'd be surprised how many people who struggle with their weight or who struggle with poor metabolic health don't eat enough during the day,\" Amati said.",

    "title": "A 42-year-old CEO was diagnosed with colon cancer. It pushed her to trade perfectionism for vulnerability.",
    "description": "A CEO who was diagnosed with late-stage colon cancer at 42 says she learned three things about good leadership from the experience.",
    "fullText": "When Jennifer Goldsack woke up after emergency surgery last Christmas, she was waiting to hear she had a stress ulcer. Maybe appendicitis. But not this.\n\nThe surgeon had news that made no sense to her, as a 42-year-old CEO and former athlete: late-stage cancer.\n\nGoldsack had always prided herself on being able to get anything done — Olympic training schedules, corporate roadmaps, back-to-back meetings.\n\nCancer forced her into a new, uncertain kind of leadership: one built on vulnerability, delegation, and uncertainty.\n\n\"Good leadership is to be able to be clear and to have a plan,\" Goldsack, head of the Digital Medicine Society (DiMe), told Business Insider. \"Or, to at least have a plan to make a plan. And I wasn't able to do that.\"\n\nShe is sharing her story to highlight the pressures that today's leaders face, often having to shoulder pain and stress in silence. And to share how she's learned, over the past 10 months, to lead her organization with more vulnerability than she ever imagined she'd allow.\n\nAs a world-class Olympic rower, Goldsack knew how to push her limits. She had perfected the art of identifying her strengths and working effectively as part of a team.\n\nThat helped her move seamlessly into leading a company. As a CEO, she prided herself on being the kind of boss who never asks her employees to do more than she would. \"Be humble, be hungry, and always be the hardest working person in the room\" was her mantra.\n\nThe early signs of cancer crept in slowly over time. With the omniscience of hindsight, it's easy to say Goldsack should have realized something was really wrong last year. In the moment, she just thought she was run down.\n\nShe was rejected from giving blood for two months in a row, because her iron levels kept getting lower and lower — too low to help others. She was dealing with stomach pain that was bordering on excruciating.\n\nThrough it all, she was telling herself she was a failure. This was her fault. How else to explain it? She'd perfected the art of training hard and recovering smart over many years. Inexplicably, her winning strategy wasn't cutting it anymore.\n\n\"It was almost an affront on how I defined myself as a person because I didn't know what I was doing wrong,\" she said. Her self-talk disintegrated. \"You idiot, suck it up, get it together, you need to get better with your sleep.\"\n\nShe was so tired in a way that a good nap on the couch simply couldn't fix. Picking at meals, stopping for Pedialyte at the gas station regularly. Was she experiencing the \"hot girl IBS\" that everyone on the internet was buzzing about? Did she need to start drinking one of those expensive green supplement powders every morning?\n\nHow foolish she had been to let the stress of her work get to her like this, she thought. Becoming that sad kind of character who eats girl dinner over the sink each night.\n\n\"My self-talk was really poor, that it was my fault,\" Goldsack said. \"I sort of absorbed pretty aggressive symptoms of a pretty frightening disease and allowed myself to drift until it really was a late-stage diagnosis.\"\n\nFor Goldsack, one of the hardest parts of being a CEO with colon cancer is the endless uncertainty.\n\nHer cancer diagnosis was a crash course in living in the moment — not in the eat-pray-love and meditate way (she hates that stuff) — but because she had to constantly reassess her prognosis day by day. She was out of work for a month in January, living in the hospital.\n\nUnable to eat, she lost 40 pounds, dropping almost a third of her body weight. She felt like a frail little bird. Even walking was exhausting, and she needed help with everything.\n\nAs a result, she got better at communicating vulnerability and signposting her own limits for others. Some of the learnings were small, but meaningful; others were radical shifts in the way she delegated her work. Here are three of her biggest lessons:\n\nGoldsack uses green to block off anything health-related on her calendar. Chemotherapy appointments and infusions are clearly marked as such on the work calendar, so everyone can see when she's out and know when she'll return to her desk. At first, the shift felt radical, but as a leader juggling cancer treatment, it's been crucial to her workflow.\n\n\"I've really leaned into using my calendar and being really clear about what I'm up to,\" she said. She expects her team to carry on while she's away, knowing she'll get to her work when she can. \"Really communicating with them early: 'Look, this is what's going on with me.'\"\n\nShe hopes the transparency helps foster more open lines of communication, even as she juggles care. \"You don't have to be my gatekeeper,\" she said. \"I will be my own gatekeeper.\"\n\nShe also began to feel more comfortable stepping back, at least sometimes.\n\nOn mornings when she felt unwell, she'd tell her team she had to go back to bed or cancel her meetings for the day — something she would have never done before.\n\n\"It's been interesting for me on a leadership journey, but also thinking about what it means to have a healthy workforce, and healthy in every sense,\" she said. \"Me saying 'guys, I can't do it today,' and I'm giving myself space, and I'm being very transparent about that and hopefully creating an environment where you guys know that you can do this too, and you will be supported.\"\n\nIt was a kind of vulnerability she'd never experienced before. She asked the chair of the board at her organization if he wanted to \"bench\" her. He didn't.\n\n\"50% of Jen's effort is like 150% of a normal person,\" DiMe chairman Dan Karlin said. \"Together we came to the conclusion that staying engaged while making sure to make time to attend to her treatment and her needs, her physical needs, of course, she needs to do that.\"\n\nBack-to-back meetings during cancer treatment quickly became an untenable situation.\n\nSo, Goldsack started giving herself five minutes at the top of every call. She starts meetings at :05 and :35 now. Those few extra minutes have been game-changing during treatment. She uses them for grabbing a drink, using the bathroom, closing her eyes for a few minutes, or vomiting. Everyone found them restorative and replenishing, to the extent that \"take 5\" has become an unofficial company policy.\n\n\"That's now sort of become best practice across the organization,\" she said. \"People realize it's actually quite nice when you're stacked with calls.\"\n\nAfter a year of cancer, Goldsack's anxious to get back to normal life. She had a public speaking gig at a major industry conference in Las Vegas in October and has her sights set on more in 2026.\n\nHer treatment course is technically over, but the odds of remission are still high, so she's being closely monitored, in a kind of cancer limbo.\n\nThe good news is that her feet no longer feel like they're stuck in flippers. Now, she's able to work out more, regaining her muscles.\n\nShe knows she's lucky. But she's also frustrated by the time she's lost.\n\nWorking has been such a gift during treatment, she said, to be able to be something other than a cancer patient. And yet the way she works has been forever changed by this year of cancer treatment.\n\n\"I always used to think that by being the toughest person, I was leading by example in the best possible way,\" she said. \"This has been an interesting way for me to think about leadership through a different lens.\"",

    "description": "American has axed first class for a single business cabin with beds and doors. The plane is overall chic and modern, but there's a row I'd avoid.",
    "fullText": "Out with the old and in with the new: American Airlines' niche cross-country Airbus jet is getting a major upgrade.\n\nOn Thursday, I toured American's first-ever Airbus A321XLR — a stretched narrowbody that can fly up to 5,400 miles (11 hours) nonstop thanks to an extra fuel tank. It's the first among US carriers.\n\nAmerican's A321XLR will replace roughly a dozen of its aging A321T jets that fly select domestic routes. The \"T\" stands for transcontinental, and the specific aircraft type is an Airbus A321-200.\n\nFor about a decade, the A321T has shuttled high-paying business and first-class passengers across the US as American's bi-coastal workhorse.\n\nThe modern A321XLR, which will launch its first cross-country route from New York to Los Angeles on December 18, retains the A321T's signature three-class layout and enhanced meal and drink service.\n\nBut the most premium cabins will feature a distinctly different design. There's no more first class; instead, a single front business cabin in a 1x1 configuration will give travelers direct aisle access.\n\nThere is also a premium economy cabin. And the coach cabin has been fine-tuned with more comfortable seats, USB-C outlets, and Bluetooth-compatible seatback screens.\n\nFares on New York—Los Angeles flights hover around $200 round-trip in economy, $1,000 in premium economy, and $2,000 in business in early 2026, rising during the busier spring break, summer, and holiday seasons.\n\nUnlike the A321T, the A321XLR will also fly transatlantic routes, beginning with New York to Edinburgh in March and eventually expanding to other European destinations. Tickets start at $600 in coach, $2,700 in premium economy, and $3,700 in business before peak-season increases.\n\nTransatlantic flying is central to the A321XLR's appeal: its range makes longer routes viable and opens access to far-flung cities that can't support a widebody (e.g., a Boeing 767 or an Airbus A330) or are out of reach for older narrowbodies. Think New York to West Africa or Florida to Northern Italy.\n\nAmerican sees the A321XLR as an opportunity to tap into this growing market for long, thin transatlantic routes while rebuilding a long-haul footprint to catch up to Delta and United, which have recovered and expanded faster post-COVID.\n\nStill, it also marks the end of an era for the A321T. But I think most customers will likely welcome the upgrades — particularly business class' sliding doors and easier bathroom access.\n\nThough there are a few asterisks: American said the doors won't be usable for a couple of months, and economy passengers in row 25 should expect a windowless view.\n\nAmerican has abandoned its A321T Flagship First for a single Flagship Business cabin with 20 private pod-like suites.\n\nThere are also 12 premium economy recliners, and 123 regular economy seats. This is down from the 190 on the A321T\n\nAmerican designed the A321XLR to cater to high-paying business and leisure passengers who want added space and comforts at 39,000 feet, and the dated A321T was no longer cutting it.\n\nFitting a suite-style business seat onto a narrowbody jet is a careful game of Tetris to ensure every foot of cabin real-estate is making money.\n\nAnd American packed in a lot: a bed, a large tray table, a Bluetooth-capable screen, a remote control, charging ports, and storage space.\n\nI liked all the amenities and found the cabin to be chic, modern, and spacious overall.\n\nThe A321XLR suites are arranged in a 1x1 layout — a major upgrade from the A321T's 2x2 business configuration that essentially trapped window-seat passengers whenever their neighbor went lie-flat.\n\nNow, every A321XLR business-class passenger gets direct aisle access. The A321T's first class is 1×1.\n\nAmong the biggest comfort requests from premium travelers worldwide is better privacy in business class.\n\nThe A321XLR achieves this with a redesigned layout and sliding doors that give it the feel of a flying mini-hotel.\n\nThe bulkier business seats narrow the cabin's single aisle to the point where there's barely any room to squeeze by another person. That tight space could create bottlenecks near the lavatory or make the aisle impassable during meal service.\n\nAnother caveat: an American spokesperson told Business Insider that the new sliding door can't be used until the airline secures certification for the feature, which they said is expected in the \"coming months.\"\n\nJetBlue Airways offers a two-passenger front-row \"Mint Studio\" on its A321LR (the A321XLR's predecessor). It's a conference-style setup that allows the airline to charge a premium for the extra space.\n\nAmerican's A321XLR lacks this suite, meaning it can't capture the potential extra revenue, but it preserves lucrative cabin real estate.\n\nUnlike the A321T, American's A321XLR will have a dedicated premium economy section.\n\nThe 2×2 cabin features winged recliners, adjustable leg and footrests, elevated food and beverage options, 37 inches of pitch, and an amenity kit. Customers also get priority check-in and boarding.\n\nAlthough the recliners do not offer the same bedroom-like experience as those at the front of the plane, they are sometimes hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars more expensive than coach.\n\nCustomers can expect the standard seatback screen, adjustable headrests, 31-inch pitch seats, and food already offered on American's A321T and most transatlantic flights.\n\nExtra legroom seats make up the first few coach rows and are distinguished by their brown headrests. Standard seats have a blue one.\n\nThe A321T seats have a different color scheme and dated amenities compared to the A321XLR.\n\nI was happy to see that the screens in every cabin, including coach, are Bluetooth-capable. The A321T is not.\n\nI can finally use my AirPods instead of the often scratchy and uncomfortable airline-provided wired headphones.\n\nThere is almost always one row on these new narrowbody planes that does not have a window. On American's A321XLR, that's row 25.\n\nCustomers here will be treated to a wall panel with no outside view — so it may be worth paying extra to avoid these windowless seats.\n\nThough some customers may prefer it for sleeping.",

    "description": "Rebag released its 2025 Comprehensive Luxury Appraisal Index for Resale report. These are the luxury jewelry and watch brands that topped the list.",
    "fullText": "The resale market is heating up, and certain jewelry and watch brands are outperforming the rest, according to new data from US-based luxury resale company Rebag.\n\nTariffs are driving up retail prices and prompting more shoppers to turn to the secondhand market. At the same time, more consumers are looking at jewelry and watches as investments, pushing 2025 to be one of the most dynamic years yet for luxury resale, Rebag said.\n\nThe resale market is expected to reach as much as $360 billion by 2030, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group and pre-owned fashion marketplace Vestiaire Collective.\n\n\"Rising primary market prices pushed more consumers to the secondary market, reaffirming its stability as a trusted and lucrative channel for collectors,\" Charles Gorra, CEO and founder of Rebag, said in a press release.\n\nThese are the jewelry and watch brands that saw the most significant value increase and experienced the fastest growth in 2025, according to Rebag's annual resale report.\n\nVan Cleef & Arpels leads among jewelry and watch brands in resale value for 2025, with styles holding 112% of their value on average, up 9% from 2024. The growth was led by the Sweet Alhambra collection, which features necklaces, bracelets, and more with unique motifs.\n\nThat means styles can resell for more than their original retail price.\n\nThe Sweet Alhambra bracelet retained 117% of its value in 2025. The 18-karat gold, mother-of-pearl bracelet with a single motif, retails for $1,540 before taxes as of December. The same style — tagged as an investment piece — is going for $2,020 on Rebag.\n\nRolex maintained its \"unicorn\" status — reserved for brands with over 90% value retention — with a 104% value retention rate. That's a 4% jump from 2024.\n\nDemand for secondhand watches is on the rise as Swiss watchmakers respond to the previous 39% tariff imposed on Switzerland. In November, the country reached a deal with the US that brought the staggering rate down to 15%.\n\nOne model, the Oyster Perpetual Submariner Hulk Date, was particularly valuable on Rebag in 2025, with an average resale value retention of 244%. A \"good\" condition Hulk Submariner sold for $19,415 on Rebag. Rolex discontinued the style in 2020, fueling demand for the piece.\n\nCartier is a brand that's gaining popularity among Gen Z secondhand shoppers. It's been spotted on famous wrists like Taylor Swift's in her engagement photos. Its bracelets, like those from the \"Love\" collection, are also particularly popular.\n\nThe French brand, which makes its watches in Switzerland, grew 4% to an average value retention of 87% in 2025, driven by its bracelet and watch offerings. The Santos de Cartier saw its value retention reach 92% with an \"excellent\" condition iteration of the model selling for $8,840 on Rebag and carrying a retail price tag of $8,650 for the same style.",

    "description": "After going through multiple layoffs as a UX designer, Kelly Withers used her savings to fund her startup, Carmu, which sells yoga mats.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kelly Withers, 36, who lives outside Detroit and is the founder of Carmu, a yoga mat startup. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nAbout seven years ago, I was in my 20s and getting divorced. I was a single mom to a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old, with no outside help. I had no place to live and no full-time job. So I started coming up with ideas as fast as I could. How am I going to take care of these two kids? I felt alone.\n\nAt that time, I was doing photography to help restaurants build their brands. Then I went to a yoga class. When I walked in, every person had the same mat and the same outfit. I started thinking about my mom and how she raised us to be individuals and stand out. I had this idea that since I was designing so many things already, I would go home and try to design a mat so I could feel more like myself when I went to class.\n\nAbout a week before I went to place my order for all the mat designs, the pandemic hit, and I was back to square one. I also lost my photography clients, because restaurants were shuttered. I panicked because I had two tiny humans relying on me.\n\nSo, I started teaching myself design for tech, because it seemed much more lucrative. From everything I've ever heard, you go into the corporate world — that's how you have a comfortable life.\n\nI got a syllabus from an online boot camp, but I couldn't afford it. So, I bought a book on every topic. Then I hired a tutor for 30 minutes at a time to go over my work and my portfolio, to make sure I was doing it right. He worked at Microsoft. He told me how much money I would potentially make as a junior designer. I remember thinking, \"Well, I'm going to have to pretend I'm a senior designer.\"\n\nPretty much on my first interview, I got a corporate job doing UX design as a lead designer. I was bullshitting, so it was a little nerve-racking. Whenever I had a project, I'd run it by the tutor, just praying that I didn't get busted. I caught on quickly, and it was fine. I did that for a couple of years.\n\nEventually, there was a lot less work. So, I started panicking.\n\nI found another job, so then I had two. Sure enough, about a month later, layoffs hit, and our whole team from the first job got wiped out.\n\nPeople talk about corporate life and how that gives you security. In my experience, you're handing over your control, your finances, your future — and it's still a gamble. I can't live my life constantly betting on somebody else and somebody else's company.\n\nI've always been into design. I want to build something tangible. I ordered about 250 mats to start. The idea was that I would continue working in tech, and then I would soft-launch these as my side hustle. That way, if I ever got laid off again, I'd have some security.\n\nThe day my yoga mats got delivered to my house, I got laid off. I looked at it as a sign: Go all in. You have some savings. See what you can do. Within about a month, I sold out.\n\nI was like, \"Now what am I going to do?\" They're made outside the US, so it takes a while for them to get here. I took the few mats that I had left and reached out to style editors.\n\nI took the rest of my savings, and I bought 1,000 mats. It was a scary moment because I was living off those savings, too.\n\nPeople talk about entrepreneurship and say, \"Oh, it's so risky.\" Well, it isn't. If you have the product, I like to think of it as a calculated risk. At this point, if I'm being honest, it was the only way I could think of making money, as I could not get a job interview.\n\nThe company is named after my mom, Carolyn Mulligan, who passed away 10 years ago after she was hit by a car on her bicycle. She had just been on my mind, and I'm convinced that because she was so strong, she has something to do with how this is working out.\n\nThe day I launched, in May, I sent out this post on Instagram to announce it. My friend called me and said to open up Vogue. Hailey Bieber was on the yoga mat in the magazine. About a week later, GQ wrote about Carmu. From there, it was just enough leverage where I could take it all over the place. We got into Goop, and we got into Anthropology in Europe. It's just crazy because it's been such a little amount of time.\n\nWhen I got the next shipment of mats, I hadn't had an interview in tech for a year. With my business, I was profitable from day one.\n\nThe big question now is whether I want to have outside investment or do it myself. I believe I could find outside investment. Have I been traumatized in handing over control of my life to other people? Yeah. I don't know if I'm ready to give up control of anything right now, just because of how everything has gone.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "title": "An 18-year-old brings in $300,000 a month selling 3D printed 'reload can holders.' Here's how he comes up with unique product ideas.",
    "description": "\"I didn't know if it was that good of an idea, but I just posted it on Instagram to see how it would do. The video went wild.\"",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, Michael Satterlee posted a video chugging a Dr Pepper from his \"tactical reload can holder.\" It's like a coozie, but more fun.\n\nIn the video, as he finishes the beverage, another soda can slides into the frame. He slams the can holder on top of it, sending the original Dr Pepper can flying, and proceeds to chug the second soda.\n\nThe video has more than 50 million views on Instagram.\n\nWhen asked why it went viral, the 18-year-old entrepreneur points to the novelty factor: \"I think it's just, they hadn't seen anything like it before.\" Viewers were also astounded by how quickly he could chug a Dr Pepper, according to the thousands of comments. That part was just good acting, though. Satterlee told Business Insider that he'd drained the can beforehand and \"pretended to drink it in like a second.\"\n\nA post shared by CruiseCup™️ (@cruisecup)\n\nSatterlee's viral video has contributed to the quick success of his e-commerce business, Cruise Cup, which sells a variety of 3D printed products, including the top-selling can holder. In November 2025 alone, he generated $300,000 in sales, which Business Insider verified by reviewing a screenshot of his Shopify dashboard.\n\nHe was poised to capitalize on the viral moment. Satterlee has been building businesses since he was 10, when he went door-to-door asking neighbors if he could mow their lawns. Nearly everyone declined.\n\n\"I knocked on doors every day for like a month straight, and I think I had one client,\" he said. However, he had more success with e-commerce, creating and selling a sand-repellent product, which funded his next project: a clog accessory company called Solefully.\n\n\"I was no stranger to the orders flooding in and what it's like as soon as a viral video goes off,\" said Satterlee, who scaled Solefully's Instagram account to more than 100,000 followers. However, he did need to buy more 3D printers to keep up with the demand for Cruise Cup products.\n\n\"When you're printing a big product, it could take 10 hours, so if you get 10 orders, then you're going to need 100 hours' worth of print time,\" he explained. \"For Solefully, I was able to maintain all my orders with around 50 printers, but when Cruise Cup hit, it just got so insane. I'd be buying batches of 30 printers and still not being able to keep up.\"\n\nSatterlee, who learned about 3D printing in a design class he took his freshman year of high school, said that one of the main benefits of printing products, rather than going through a manufacturer, is the low barrier to entry.\n\n\"Anybody could do it. You could get a 3D printer for like 100 bucks, and a roll of filament costs like $20. They make the modeling software so easy now; there's even AI where you could just type in a prompt, and it will come up with a model for you that'll be ready to 3D print.\"\n\nSatterlee's company has outgrown his childhood home in Clifton Park, New York. The operation \"took over my entire house,\" he recalled. \"My basement was all 3D printers, my dining room was my shipping area, and then my room was my studio.\"\n\nWhile he still lives there, he's shifted operations to a nearby warehouse that houses more than 130 printers. He's also in the process of setting up a mold with a manufacturer and expects to produce stainless steel products by mid-2026.\n\nBefore the viral can holder, Satterlee experimented with a variety of products, including a one-can cooler that was performing well. It prompted him to look at the most dominant player in the cooler space — Yeti — and see if there were any products he could innovate.\n\n\"I was looking at a standard Yeti coozie, and I was like, 'How can I make this better?'\" he said.\n\n\"A couple of things popped into my mind: I can make it easier to load. Instead of having to twist the top off, why couldn't you just be able to slide a drink in through the bottom and then drink it through the top? If I tighten the caps up a little bit, then I can make it so when you put a new can in, the empty will fly out like a shell case.\"\n\nHe figured he was onto something, and Instagram confirmed his suspicions.\n\n\"I didn't know if it was that good of an idea, but I just posted it on Instagram to see how it would do,\" he said. \"The video went wild.\"\n\nThen, he paid close attention to what his audience was saying about the product. One comment popped up over and over again: \"Make it hold two cans,\" he said. \"So that's what I did from there, and that did even better.\"\n\nSatterlee believes in creating a product quickly and iterating from there, rather than spending months trying to perfect it. That's a major advantage of working with a 3D printer: you can create products quickly and at a low cost, and then test the market before deciding to invest time, money, and materials in producing something at scale.\n\n\"Just make whatever idea you have exist first, and then make it good later,\" he said. \"People would tell me all the time, 'What's the point of a can cooler if it's 3D printed? It's not insulated. It's not going to keep the drink cold.' But I didn't care. I had the vision. If you have an idea, just bring it to life as fast as you can, and then go from there.\"\n\nDon't expect your first product, or even first several products, to succeed, he added.\n\n\"You have to be super, super resilient because you're going to fail a ton of times. I just listed to you the companies that I had that made some money. I've lost money on a bunch of businesses, a bunch of ventures — and then sometimes you just get lucky, and it hits.\"",

    "title": "Netflix paid $55 million for a 'visionary' sci-fi epic that was never finished. We saw a glimpse of it at the director's criminal trial.",
    "description": "Carl Rinsch was found guilty of defrauding Netflix when he went on a spending spree instead of finishing \"White Horse.\" We got some of the footage.",
    "fullText": "When Netflix executives first saw a glimpse of \"White Horse\" in 2018, they were blown away.\n\nCindy Holland, who at the time oversaw the streaming service's original content, read the script sitting in Keanu Reeves' home, she said in court testimony earlier this month. \"White Horse\" was the brainchild of Carl Rinsch, who had previously directed Reeves in the big-budget \"47 Ronin.\"\n\nAt the time, Rinsch had already created a trailer and six preliminary episodes of \"White Horse,\" funded in part with his own money. Holland testified she found the footage \"stunning\" and the script \"really impressive.\"\n\n\"I believed we should pursue the project,\" testified Holland, who is now an executive at Paramount.\n\nNetflix agreed to pay tens of millions of dollars on the project, but \"White Horse\" was never finished. Instead of premiering on the nation's biggest streaming platform, \"White Horse\" has become the subject of legal disputes, news articles, and, finally, a criminal trial against Rinsch in Manhattan federal court.\n\nIt culminated in a guilty verdict on Thursday, where a jury found Rinsch guilty of defrauding Netflix by using the $11 million on a personal spending spree.\n\nOver the years, the public has seen very little of the sci-fi passion project that wowed Netflix executives into shelling out $55 million for the project — until now.\n\nWhite Horse\" depicts a world with artificially created \"Organic Intelligence\" beings, which resemble humans. When the world discovers they're not flesh-and-blood humans, the artificial beings create their own private cities, walled off from the rest of the world, and form their own society.\n\nIn 2018, Netflix agreed to pay $44 million for Rinsch to deliver about 13 episodes, ranging from about four to 14 minutes and totaling about 120 minutes. It gave Rinsch an additional $11 million in March 2020 to finish \"White Horse\" — money the jury found he spent on luxury goods instead of finishing the show.\n\nThe lack of public images has made it difficult to understand why a major entertainment company would agree to spend $55 million on \"White Horse\" and why Netflix continued to infuse cash into the project after Rinsch exceeded his initial budget.\n\nNetflix even gave Rinsch coveted \"final cut\" privilege, effectively giving him ultimate creative control over what \"White Horse\" would look like, despite \"47 Ronin\" flopping at the box office.\n\nSome of the work that went into the production made it into the evidentiary material for Rinsch's trial, including six episodes that Rinsch created with his own money, before Netflix agreed to invest in the project.\n\nProsecutors played the trailer for jurors, then asked former Netflix executives about their high hopes for \"White Horse\" — and the disappointment and anxiety that followed as the production fell apart.\n\nPeter Friedlander, another Netflix executive, testified early in the trial that he was \"blown away\" by Rinsch's \"visionary\" footage.\n\n\"The visuals were something that I had never seen before,\" Friedlander said.\n\nRinsch's defense lawyers showed jurors concept art that Rinsch and his production team created to illustrate the elaborate sci-fi world the director had built. Rinsch — a protégé of \"Alien\" and \"Gladiator\" director Ridley Scott — described \"White Horse\" as a potential franchise on par with \"Star Wars\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nAfter Netflix agreed to pay Rinsch for the project, the writer-director-producer spent months filming hundreds of hours of footage in Brazil, Uruguay, and Hungary, using the production codename \"Conquest.\"\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, Rinsch \"abandoned\" \"White Horse\" after running out of money in the fall of 2019. He swindled Netflix out of the additional $11 million the streaming service agreed to pay him the following March, prosecutors said.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Rinsch's attorney Daniel McGuinness urged the jurors to watch the six episodes — which totaled about 40 minutes — while they deliberated the verdict.\n\nIt was absurd, McGuinness said, to think that Rinsch planned to scam Netflix through the production of the project when he had put so much creative energy into making it a reality.\n\nAccording to Rinsch's defense attorneys, the director believed that the bulk of the $11 million March 2020 payment was meant to reimburse him for cost overruns he had paid out of his own pocket.\n\nRinsch continued to work on \"White Horse\" throughout 2020 and in 2021, his lawyers said.\n\nTo demonstrate this, the attorneys pointed to additional concept art that he had commissioned and created himself.\n\nThe artwork featured architectural and costume designs, which Rinsch said would go toward a potential second season.\n\nMuch of the concept art depicted scenes in a castle. Trial records showed that Rinsch booked Palais Liechtenstein, a castle in Vienna. Rinsch testified he wanted to film additional scenes there, but he believed Netflix decided to scrap \"White Horse\" altogether before that could happen.\n\nAccording to one draft of Rinsch's screenplay, two twin-like \"Organic Intelligence\" beings would rule over their society and then betray each other in a Shakespearean fashion, legal records show.\n\nThe concept images for the unfinished scenes, entered into evidence in Rinsch's criminal trial, depict an apparent murder, with one of the beings lying on the floor in a pool of golden blood. The scene is not included in Rinsch's preliminary episodes.\n\nProsecutors said Rinsch's concept art was a fig leaf. Pointing to an agreement between him and Netflix, they said Rinsch was supposed to spend the entire $11 million infusion on finishing the first season — not just a small fraction of the sum for concept art. One prosecutor described the funds Rinsch paid to book the castle as \"a $30,000 down payment on an $11 million fraud.\"\n\nOne of the prosecution's arguments centered on Rinsch's purchase of multiple Rolls-Royces.\n\nRinsch testified that the cars would be used for what he called the \"Calvacade\" — a procession of cars that shuttled diplomats through the \"no man's land\" between the \"Organic Intelligence\" beings' independent cities and the human world.\n\nIn closing arguments, Assistant US Attorney David Markewitz turned the concept art against Rinsch.\n\nHe pointed the jury to planning documents that showed he had planned to shoot the \"Calvacade\" scenes in Brazil in 2019 — two years before he purchased the Rolls-Royces under his own name. On insurance records, Rinsch had said the cars were for himself, not for a Netflix production.\n\n\"At an even more basic level, you know it would make no sense to actually buy five Rolls-Royces just to shoot a few scenes with them,\" Markewitz told the jury.\"\n\nShortly before a sober-faced jury walked out of the deliberation room and announced they found him guilty of all counts, Rinsch said he was happy a journalist at Business Insider had watched the six preliminary episodes and understood his vision.\n\n\"I'm glad you watched it,\" he told Business Insider. \"It means a lot to me.\"",

    "title": "Longtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber says 2026 will be a year of reckoning for Musk's car company",
    "description": "Tesla-investor-turned-bear Ross Gerber says that Elon Musk needs to show results on the company's biggest initiatives in 2026 or face investor backlash.",
    "fullText": "Ross Gerber, an early backer of Tesla, is worried about the future of Elon Musk's car company.\n\nGerber doesn't hold back about what he thinks is the EV maker's biggest issue: its autonomous driving technology. Failure to live up to expectations would be a blow to investors' bull thesis for Tesla, which is pegged in large part to the success of its self-driving cars.\n\nGerber, the founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, has been a vocal Tesla bear all year. His perspective hasn't changed as Musk's company has rolled out driverless cars in cities across the US, and what he's seen has actually made him more concerned.\n\nGerber told Business Insider why he thinks 2026 will be a pivotal year for the EV maker, in which Musk will be forced to show real progress on the lofty goals he's set for Tesla.\n\nAnyone who follows Gerber knows that he has gone from a Musk supporter to an outspoken Tesla bear in recent years. He's publicly called for Musk to resign and criticized his focus on other ventures, such as his time leading the Department of Government Efficiency and his efforts to buy X before that.\n\nMusk stepped away from government months ago, but Gerber maintains that the time he spent away from his companies is still hurting Tesla stock, particularly as the it dukes it out with competitors in the self-driving car market.\n\n\"The year that Elon took off from Tesla really cost Tesla a year,\" Gerber told Business Insider.\n\nIn that time, Tesla's chief competitor, Waymo, has continued to dominate the self-driving car market. Gerber attributes this to Musk's refusal to use LidAR technology in Tesla's vehicles, a remote sensing method that has helped Waymo increase the safety of its cars on the road.\n\n\"Waymo has expanded rapidly in our area,\" he said. \"So Tesla has to accept, if they just throw a couple sensors on and improve their hardware system, they can solve full self-driving next month.\"\n\nHowever, Gerber thinks that Musk will continue to favor the use of AI and cameras. And since Musk has staked much of Tesla's future on its self-driving car technology, he thinks this approach is about to start costing the company.\n\nOverall, Gerber thinks that 2026 will be the year Musk needs to show investors results of Tesla's many initiatives or face backlash from the market.\n\n\"I've been saying this for some time, next year is kind of like the come-to-Jesus year for Tesla,\" he said.\n\nMusk has said that self-driving technology is Tesla's future, but so far, the company has struggled to get drivers to actually pay for it.\n\nGerber added that he sees Google and Waymo's parent company, Alphabet, as the best stock to buy for gaining exposure to the self-driving car market, due to Waymo's edge over Tesla and Alphabet's resources.\n\nHis bullish thesis on Waymo centers on the company's strong presence in major US cities, which is expanding while Tesla has only just begun its rollout this year.\n\n\"Google has the money and they're not going to wait,\" Gerber said. \"They know they can scale, so for Tesla to catch them, they would need this to work right away, basically, and then they need to start building infrastructure.\"\n\nAnother problem Gerber sees is one he's brought up before, which is Musk's public perception. That might be a problem even if Tesla catches up to competitors in key areas like autonomous driving. Gerber thinks the image of Musk has yet to recover since his foray into politics sparked divisive views among consumers earlier this year.\n\n\"The image of the company is so negative in people's minds that even if they had cabs everywhere, people would just choose another cab company, because there's plenty to choose,\" he speculated.\n\nGerber noted that he also has strong doubts about the demand for the humanoid robots that Tesla is building, despite Musk's claims that they'll eliminate poverty and be able to perform surgery.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Hiring doesn't stop in December, and some managers need to fill roles before budgets reset in January.",
    "fullText": "If all you want for Christmas is a job, don't let the holiday fanfare slow down your search.\n\nRecruiters and hiring managers say a common misconception is that employers pause interviewing at the end of the year because decision-makers are all on vacation. In reality, they say hiring activity tends to hold steady, and in some cases, managers are pressed to fill openings before their talent-acquisition budgets reset in January.\n\nThey need to \"use it or lose it,\" said Nicole Fernandez-Valle, lead talent acquisition partner at Miami-based Royal Caribbean Group. \"This is still a pretty hardworking time for our recruitment teams.\"\n\nBrian Fink, an independent recruiter in Georgia, said he's helping an AI startup in Atlanta find two managers and six software engineers to bring on board before 2025 comes to a close.\n\n\"Employers want to start 2026 ready,\" said Fink. \"They don't want to start recruiting in January. They want to start running a race.\"\n\nWhile other job seekers put their searches on hold, take advantage of the lighter competition to submit applications, said Aaron Roberts, a hiring manager at commercial real-estate company JLL. He has more than 50 openings he's looking to fill in California, including ones for administrative assistants, facilities managers, and producers. He anticipates filling at least a third by New Year's.\n\n\"You might miss an opportunity if you put your job hunt on hold,\" he said. \"Keep going.\"\n\nRoberts knows from personal experience. He applied for his current position as vice president of operations at JLL just before Thanksgiving in 2019 and did several rounds of interviews in December that year. The last one took place five days before Christmas.\n\nSince people tend to be jollier around the holidays, it's a good time to reach out to folks who could potentially help with your job search, said Julia Levy, an independent talent-acquisition executive in Memphis and author of \"From Hi to Hired: Your Insider Guide to Internships.\" They'll be more likely to take your call, she said.\n\nCompetition for jobs will also likely intensify in January, she added. People who put off their searches for the holidays return, and those resolving to find a new job in the new year enter the market, Levy said.\n\nJob hunting during the winter holidays can be more mentally challenging than at any other time of year. Your family and friends may be shopping for gifts, decorating the house, and baking sweet treats, while you're still at a computer searching for newly posted job listings.\n\nAnd if you're a parent, your kids are likely off from school and may be eager for your attention.\n\n\"It's so hard,\" said Helene Vo, a career strategist in Los Angeles. \"You're almost going against the grain of what the holidays are about.\"\n\nBut this is also why competition for jobs dies down — and why it can pay off to stick with your search routine. When you're used to applying to five or six jobs a day, \"it's much easier to override\" all of the holiday hoopla around you, Vo said.",

    "description": "Influencers are driving billions of spending each year. Here are the brands benefiting most from their endorsements.",
    "fullText": "Influencers have changed the way we shop, quite literally influencing the trends that hit, the brands we buy, and the items we covet.\n\nAffiliate marketing — a way to drive sales through links posted by creators or publishers — is expected to drive $216 billion in US e-commerce sales this year, according to data from EMARKETER.\n\nThese links are a direct way to track the shopping that is actually inspired by influencers.\n\nShopMy, a social commerce platform, enables creators to build shoppable landing pages and earn commissions from sales driven by their links on social media.\n\nMore than 185,000 creators use the platform, and their recommendations drive more than $1 billion in sales annually, according to the company. In October, ShopMy raised $70 million in a Series B funding round, a testament to the belief that the model will continue to grow.\n\n\"Affiliate has become a core part of brand building,\" Tiffany Lopinsky, cofounder and president of ShopMy, told Business Insider over email. \"The top brands now treat creators as cultural partners.\"\n\nA total of 1,200 brands use ShopMy.\n\nThe platform gave Business Insider an inside look at the best-selling brands on the platform this year as part of ShopMy's year-end report.\n\nAt the end of last year, retailer J. Crew named a new chief marketing officer, Julia Collier, who previously built out clothing brand Skims' very successful influencer marketing arm. She has made creators a key part of J. Crew's strategy; its holiday campaign featured popular influencers, like \"Subway Takes\" host Kareem Rahma and TikToker Delaney Rowe, who created shoppable wishlists on Shopmy.\n\nRedlight masks are all over social media, and CurrentBody has won customers through influencer partnerships.\n\nIn job descriptions, CurrentBody's parent company, The Beauty Tech Group, has said influencer marketing is a \"growth engine.\" Its masks are featured on the ShopMy profiles of reality star Bethenny Frankel and fitness instructor Melissa Wood-Tepperberg.\n\nFashion brand Tory Burch's social media marketing has stood out this year. In addition to being a best-selling brand on ShopMy, it had the most engagement of any brand at New York Fashion Week earlier this year, according to social analytics firm ListenFirst. Its social posts featured influencers like TikToker Alex Consani and celebrities like Sydney Sweeney, Lana Condor, and Chloe Fineman.\n\nA multibrand e-commerce retailer, Tuckernuck's executives have discussed the importance of creators to its brand. Cofounder September Rinnier Votta told EMARKETER last year that the company looks for influencers who are already touring Tuckernuck, as well as microinfluencers with an authentic following.\n\nWomen's contemporary label Veronica Beard is favored by big-name influencers like Tinx and Valeria Lipovetsky, who have posted in the brand's clothing for years. Long-term relationships with creators are key to the company's strategy, Veronica Beard execs have said in multiple interviews, and the brand brings them in to launch products and at other key moments.\n\nDirect-to-consumer home and apparel brand Jenni Kayne understands the power of influencers. Its first hit product, a pair of flats, went viral thanks to one. Now it has a large and eclectic influencer network; Reese Witherspoon, Sofia Richie Grainge, and Gucci Westman feature Jenni Kayne products on their ShopMy pages.",

    "description": "I became a morning person when I stopped pressing snooze and started my day with something I like. Now, I feel calmer throughout the day.",
    "fullText": "At the start of the summer, I was desperately craving some new routines to propel me into a new chapter. I wanted to create some scaffolding in my daily life that would help hold me up during a difficult time. I didn't intend to become a morning person in the process, but that's what happened.\n\nI realized that if I wanted to change the way I felt throughout my day, the best place to start would be, well, at the start of it. If I could get myself into a better headspace as close to when I woke up as possible, maybe that good mood would be more resilient, and so would I.\n\nI didn't even need to change the time my alarm was set for — I just needed to stop pressing snooze.\n\nWhen I thought about it, I realized that I'd never been glad I pressed the snooze button; I'd never thought to myself, \"I'm so glad I got that extra seven minutes of sleep.\" Instead, I often woke up after a snooze — or series of snoozes — feeling more groggy and disoriented than had I just stuck to the tiny promise I made myself the night before when I set the alarm and put my feet on my floor when it first went off.\n\nOver time, both Rooney and I started to love the dog park; not only did it become part of our routine, but we both made friends. He is learning how to play with other dogs — he used to just make the rounds from person to person, enjoying getting pet — and I enjoy starting my day talking to other people, rather than staring at screens.\n\nI also realized that by waking up earlier and starting my day with something I actually enjoy, it's become easier to exercise in the morning afterward. I've tried — and failed — plenty of times to be a morning exercise person, but it's never the first thing I want to do when I open my eyes.\n\nStarting my morning like this has a few benefits. I feel less rushed and more productive by the time I sit down to work, which sets me up to feel more positive throughout the day. Overall, I feel less anxious, and I've been sleeping better, as well.\n\nIt also means I've barely looked at my phone for the first couple of hours that I'm awake; for some reason, this has translated to less mindless scrolling throughout the day. I feel more grounded, calmer, and more mindful, and though I rolled my eyes at them before, I'm now a proud member of the morning person club.",

    "description": "Jane Post, 81, lives in a small mobile home on her daughter's land. It gives her both the freedom and closeness to family she needs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation between writer Jennifer Jane and her mom, Jane Post. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAfter moving out of the home I loved and lived in for 31 years, it took me a few years to settle on a housing situation that suited me. I was used to living alone and liked it, but my home became too much work and responsibility once I reached my mid-70s, and I needed something different.\n\nI lived with a friend for a few months, then moved across the country from Florida to New York in 2020 to live with my older daughter for a couple of years. However, neither of those arrangements was the right fit for me.\n\nI left New York and moved back to Florida without a plan. My younger daughter offered me a mobile home on her property to stay in while I figured it out. I moved in and didn't move out. It felt just right. It is small and easy for me to take care of. It's the perfect size to fit the things I hold dear. I call it \"The Teapot.\"\n\nI have always loved teapots. I once read a story about a retired Colonel who bought a very tiny cottage in England that had belonged to a little old lady who used it as a tearoom for walkers that wandered by. It was so small that it had just one tiny table and two chairs. The Colonel said it was like living in a teapot. I recalled this story when I stepped into the mobile home, and I knew I had at last found my home sweet home…The Teapot.\n\nI like nearly everything about living in my Teapot. Old people often have balance issues... if I lose my balance, I always have a nearby wall, table, or counter to bounce off of. The only thing I don't like is that there aren't enough electrical outlets.\n\nI share my little home with a cast of characters: Penny, the tubby brown mystery mutt mix; Choccy, the chihuahua who has difficulty walking due to old age; Little Thing, a three-legged tiny chihuahua mix; Pinkie, the cat; Agatha Raisin, the bantam chicken; Sarose, her evilness, a seabrite chicken; Jaeger, the barn cat; and then there's me, the human who does their bidding. My animals bring a huge amount of joy into my small space.\n\nMy day begins around 5 am when I start taking care of my animals. I take the ones with special needs outside one by one. I feed and water them. I make my tea. I take Penny for a walk, then put the chickens outside in their pen. I make more tea. I feed and water the wild birds.\n\nI spend the afternoon doing whatever I want. It's heavenly to sit and watch the birds at the feeders, just six feet away, and sip tea. Everything I want is close by and easy to reach. There is a stack of books sitting on a table to be read.\n\nThere are shallow boxes of fossilized shells on top of the two chickens' indoor overnight pen. I love looking through the shells, thinking about how to make them into lovely works of art. I can't do that if they are in a box out of sight. I have made many beautiful things in my small world. I think the smallness helps me to focus and be even more creative.\n\nI love that my two great-grandsons, ages 4 and 8, who live nearby, enjoy visiting my little enchanted world. They pop in and out to spend time with me and my collection of little creatures. They feel the magic and love the Teapot as I do.\n\nI was very ill recently, and all I could manage was to feed all my animals and get them in and out, then I had to go back to bed, too sick to read or watch a movie. As I lay there, I really felt as if the Teapot was giving me comfort like a warm hug. I could look around and see, with one glance, all the things I hold dear that bring me happy memories.\n\nWhen you get old, the list of things you'll never get to do, have, or own might seem never-ending, and past memories are your lifeline. Every memory I've fit into my little home brings me happiness and comfort.\n\nLiving in a small space is not for everyone, but for me, the Teapot is heaven on Earth. I'm in my 80s now. My younger daughter is nearby if I need anything or want company, but I am able to live independently in a way that works for me. I can have everything that's important to me at this time of my life — family, freedom from the responsibilities and demands of home ownership, my animals, privacy, peace, and most everything I love at my fingertips.",

    "fullText": "AI won't change what it takes to be a good lawyer, according to one industry leader.\n\n\"So I actually think a lot of what makes an incredible lawyer today is still what will make one tomorrow,\" Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive, wrote during a recent Reddit Ask Me Anything chat.\n\nWeinberg, whose AI startup is already disrupting Big Law, said the best partners Harvey works with understand their business needs.\n\n\"I've found that the best partners are the ones that are incredible at understanding what the actual business needs are and framing an agreement based on that,\" Weinberg wrote. \"Same goes for litigation, it's who can come up with the best arguments/story not who is the best at going through emails in discovery.\"\n\nOverall, junior partners should try to get \"as much client experience as possible,\" Weinberg said.\n\n\"That's actually the main thing I pitch to firm leaders - they should focus more on giving juniors client experience, and be okay with them making some mistakes - that's how they become the best partners in the future,\" he wrote.\n\nLast week, Harvey reached a valuation of $8 billion, thanks to a recent funding round led by A16z. Weinberg said that no single company, including Harvey, will own the legal tech market.\n\n\"I don't think a single player is going to capture all of the pretty enormous amount of value that will be created in the next 10 years in this space,\" he wrote in the Reddit chat.\n\nAs for lawyers who want to follow in his footsteps, Weinberg said they need to get used to failure.\n\n\"Junior lawyers are often practiced perfectionists, and startups are all about risk, reward, and resilience,\" Weinberg told Business Insider after his Reddit chat. \"So I meant what I said--the biggest thing a lawyer who wants to work in the tech space should do is build up tolerance for failure.\"",

    "fullText": "Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Burnout is common. For $130,000 a week, this burnout clinic treats CEOs, founders, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals who require discreet and private care. Included: medical treatments, a midday IV, a personal trainer, and a private chef.\n\nBut first: The new wave of leaders is young.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, Download Business Insider's app here.\n\nForget big lecture halls, dream internships, or comfy full-time jobs.\n\nThere's a growing cohort of young professionals who are approaching their careers differently. They're torching the traditional playbook and doing things their own way in an effort to reshape industries and solve global challenges.\n\nWe've spent the past year interviewing \"young geniuses\" — the next wave of leaders, innovators, and builders who are taking unconventional approaches to work, some as early as high school.\n\nThese folks aren't just making a living, either. They're earning serious dough at a young age by building AI tools, moving fast, and raising money from investors willing to bet big on the AI race.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to 16 young founders this year who have collectively raised over $100 million. They're under the age of 27. Many are even teenagers.\n\nHere are some of their stories and advice for others.\n\nZach Yadegari sold his first app at 16 and cofounded an AI-powered nutrition app while he was still in high school. It's generating around $30 million annually. \"My advice to anyone would be to get started. Ignore the noise, ignore the people telling you that it's impossible to do it at a young age, and ignore the people trying to push you down a specific path to accomplish your goals.\"\n\nChristine Zhang turned down an internship to spend two months building an AI startup with her college roommate. By the end of the summer, they raised $1 million. She's taking a gap year from Harvard to focus on the startup. \"I had to delete my Instagram during the first week of classes so I wouldn't get FOMO. However, I don't regret my decision, and the feeling of missing out has definitely improved over time.\"\n\nArlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped out of high school to launch an AI coding agent startup that's raised $6.2 million. Both of his parents are entrepreneurs. He taught himself to code and founded his first company at the age of 15. \"Being young gives you a head start. There's still time if you fail, which is why young people try crazy things.\"\n\nAre you a young genius? In awe of what the kids are doing these days? Drop me a line and let me know what you think — srussolillo@businessinsider.com\n\nWhat are the values that define America? Liberty, patriotism — and thievery, as it turns out. From petty shoplifting to return fraud, everyday Americans are becoming small-time scammers.\n\nThey're not stealing from everyone — just the companies they deem big enough to weather the loss, or those they think are making money off their backs. But too much Robin Hood-ing could have unintended consequences for small businesses … and the rest of us who are still paying for things.\n\nWhile much of the broader labor market has been marked by slow hiring, it's also been cushioned by low levels of firing. That's not the case for the tech industry, though.\n\nUS tech companies have announced roughly 154,000 layoffs through November, according to Challenger. That's a 17% increase from the prior year and the most of any private-sector industry. These cuts have fueled fierce competition for roles. BI spoke to more than 20 tech professionals who are struggling to find work.\n\n\"It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman.\"\n\nWhen a jury returned an $11.5 million verdict to a former SHRM employee who sued for racial discrimination, CEO Johnny Taylor sent a clear message: The fight isn't over yet.\n\nIn a video seen by Business Insider, Taylor said the case lacked merit and would go down as \"just a blip in the history of SHRM.\" The company said in a LinkedIn post that it planned to appeal the decision.\n\nWhen Sima Sistani left her role as CEO at WeightWatchers, she called Oprah for advice. She told Sistani to take a year to say no to everything. Now, Sistani is an adjunct professor at Duke University, teaching a course on women's leadership.\n\nFor BI's Power Hours series, Sistani shared what a typical day in her life looks like — from reading a physical newspaper and prepping talking points for her class, to ending the day with a romance fantasy novel.\n\nDaily affirmations and less time on phones.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse.\"\n\n— Doug Shapiro, a media analyst and senior advisor at BCG, on media companies struggling to get people to engage with their content following Disney's deal with OpenAI.\n\nBI rode a Rivian spin-off e-bike around New York City\n\nBike fanatic and BI correspondent Jack Newsham took Also's TM-B e-bike for a spin around the city.

    "description": "BBC Scotland previews the Scottish League Cup final between St Mirren and Celtic.",
    "fullText": "Premier Sports Cup final: St Mirren v Celtic\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Sunday, 14 December Kick-off: 15:30 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds & digital\n\nIt's a game which means so much to so many, and for so many reasons.\n\nFor St Mirren, the objective is a straightforward one. Win the Scottish League Cup for only the second time in the club's history. Be heroes. Legends. Deities of Paisley who will never have to buy a beer again.\n\nIn the other half, it's about another trophy to add to the cabinet. But, it's also about arresting a run of two straight defeats for new Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy with the deafening din of fan unrest bellowing towards the club's board.\n\nWhatever happens at Hampden on Sunday, it promises to be a defining day for both sides.\n\nSt Mirren arrive at the national stadium with nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\nAny team who faces either half of the Old Firm in a cup final will know they are up against a huge task. Vastly higher amounts of resources, money, fans and quality set the bar high.\n\nYet, Stephen Robinson's team will emerge from the Hampden tunnel on Sunday with a steely-eyed determination and a swagger of self belief.\n\nIt's founded on both their own ethos and also the fortunes of their opponents.\n\nSt Mirren faced in-form Motherwell in last month's semi-final, a game many tipped the Lanarkshire team to win given their heralded brand of intricate football. Instead, they were outfought, out-thought and outplayed by Saints on the way to a deserved 4-1 victory.\n\nIt was a tactical lesson from Robinson who masterminded the perfect game plan to nullify his old club.\n\nDuring his time at Fir Park, he guided them to a final at Hampden twice in the one season. On both occasions, they came up short against Celtic.\n\nThis time, he'll surely feel that it can be third-time lucky.\n\nSt Mirren and Celtic have played each other twice on league duty this season, and Saints have been desperately unlucky to lose both by a late goal.\n\nThe cause for concern for the 13,000 or so Saints fans going to Hampden will come from their form since beating Motherwell in that semi-final.\n\nFive games have been and gone with just one win, albeit that came in their last game with a 2-0 victory over Dundee United.\n\nSt Mirren sit ninth in the league - although with two games in hand over some of their rivals - but Robinson is famous for his team being well drilled and hard to play against.\n\nThey are tags which Saints took umbrage with in the wake of that Hampden win last month. While many presumed they would just try to stifle Motherwell, the Paisley side were ruthless, clinical, and played with a desire which blew away Jens Berthel Askou's team.\n\n'Old ladies were hanging out windows' - remembering St Mirren's 2013 League Cup win\n\nSt Mirren's journey to Hampden began all the way back in July, in the group stages. After a goalless draw in their opener against Arbroath, who snatched the bonus point with a shootout victory, the Buddies beat Forfar 2-1 then skelped Annan 8-2, helped by a hat-trick from Mikael Mandron.\n\nA 2-1 closing victory over Ayr, thanks to Killian Phillips' double, earned top spot with 10 points from 12.\n\nSecond round: St Mirren 1-1 Hearts (5-4 on pens)\n\nThe Paisley side had their work cut out against high-flying Premiership leaders Hearts in round two.\n\nAlex Gogic put Saints ahead before half-time, only for Oisin McEntee to level with just over 10 minutes to play. The tie went the distance and Shamal George's save from Claudio Braga's penalty in the shootout proved decisive as the Buddies squeezed through.\n\nQuarter-final: Kilmarnock 2-2 St Mirren (3-5 on pens)\n\nYet again St Mirren had to progress on spot-kicks. Mandron and Jayden Richardson struck either side of Robbie Deas' equaliser but a late penalty from Bruce Anderson took the tie to a shootout.\n\nMalik Dijksteel capitalised on Kyle Magennis' miss for the hosts to set up a semi-final against Motherwell.\n\nSemi-final: Motherwell 1-4 St Mirren\n\nThe Buddies had no reason to fear as they cruised past Jens Berthel Askou's highly-praised Steelmen and were two to the good at half-time thanks to Mandron and Dan Nlundulu.\n\nCallum Hendry pulled one back late on but it wasn't enough to mount a comeback as Robinson's side found another two goals courtesy of Richard King and Mandron.\n\nNancy's introduction to life in Glasgow as Celtic manager has been a challenging one, to say the least.\n\nThe former Columbus Crew head coach has two games and two defeats under his belt in what is a pivotal week for the defending Scottish champions.\n\nFollowing the sudden resignation of Brendan Rodgers, Martin O'Neill was sworn in to take temporary charge.\n\nAmid amusing anecdotes in press conferences, leaping about on the touchline and chat about stealing tracksuits as a souvenir of his second spell at Parkhead, a ship that was heading for trouble was steadied.\n\nRangers were defeated in the League Cup semi-final, a heroic showing in Rotterdam stunned Feyenoord, and the gap to league leaders Hearts was narrowed to three points before their visit to Glasgow last Sunday.\n\nIt proved to be Nancy's first game, and one in which the Edinburgh club surged to a 2-1 victory as howls of ire around Celtic Park were swapped for swathes of empty seats before full-time.\n\nNext was Thursday's 3-0 Europa League loss to Roma, with the margin of defeat not reflective of the large gulf between the two teams on the night.\n\nDiscussion of whether Nancy should have been excused from taking charge across this hat-trick of games before beginning his era has raged across the air waves, column inches and social media pages.\n\nFan dissatisfaction at the club's board also doesn't help the backdrop to this one.\n\nAlready there is pressure on Nancy, there always is in this part of town. But what has gone in the last week, and even before he even set foot in Glasgow, has raised the tension level.\n\nWinning the club's 23rd League Cup will not cure Celtic of all its problems. Months of supporter frustration at league placing, a failed transfer window and a botched attempt at Champions League progression will take some undoing.\n\nHowever, victory over St Mirren would provide a firm foothold for the Frenchman to dig into. It's the chance for a first win on the board, an incredibly early shot at a first trophy at the club, and a platform on which to stabilise and build.\n\nIf they don't win, the level of fury from fans could be off the scale.\n\n'Nancy exposed to brutal life as Celtic manager as cup final looms'\n\nCup final victory would 'validate' Celtic process - Nancy\n\nSecond round: Celtic 4-1 Falkirk\n\nCeltic kicked off their trophy defence under Brendan Rodgers back in August, beating Falkirk 4-1 at home with Daizen Maeda, Alistair Johnston and Dane Murray on target along with a Liam Henderson own goal.\n\nQuarter-final: Partick Thistle 0-4 Celtic\n\nThey followed that up by swatting aside Partick Thistle 4-0 in the quarter-final at Firhill. Sebastian Tounekti scored his first goal for the club and Yang Hyun-jun, Liam Scales and substitute Luke McCowan also netted.\n\nSemi-final: Celtic 3-1 Rangers AET\n\nQuestions were raised about the 73-year-old's return but O'Neill kept the momentum going as Celtic sailed to a 3-1 win after extra time over their fierce rivals.\n\nGoals from Jonny Kenny, captain Callum McGregor and Callum Osmand secured their passage to the final.\n\nSt Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: \"There will be a nervous energy, of course. We aren't Celtic who get to every cup final or every other cup final.\n\n\"So we have to embrace the day and enjoy the day but most of all what I coin it with is have faith over fear. Really believe in the system, in each other, in the staff, and the stuff we've put on in preparation.\n\n\"We see all the photographs of the teams that have been very, very successful here and won trophies and they're held in such high regard. What I try and do is to tell the players 'We want your names there, we want your pictures there'.\n\n\"They've got their pictures up for the European achievements, for the top-six achievements, now we want them up [for winning the cup]. We want them to be remembered, we want them to be recognised everywhere they go for the rest of their life.\"\n\nSt Mirren defender Marcus Fraser: \"In 10, 20 years, people will probably still be talking about it [a win] and you can obviously write your own chapter in the club's history.\n\n\"So I think that's one of the key aspects that we want to do, really grab the opportunity with two hands and if we can get up on that wall, then in a few years' time, when you walk by it, that would be a great feeling.\"\n\nCeltic manager Wilfried Nancy: \"Yes, I would like to win the trophy. I'm pretty sure that, if we don't win it, it's going to be difficult, because when we lose, this is painful.\n\n\"But, again, I am optimistic as a person. So hopefully we're going to do it. And also if it's going to validate what we are doing. But, if not, I don't want to think about this because, for the moment, I want to stay positive and this is the way I think.\n\n\"I'm going to have many, many other times to show, to do my stuff and to convince the fans that I am the right guy.\"\n\nCeltic midfielder Luke McCowan: \"We're disappointed as a team with the last two results and we need to get on top of it.\n\n\"We have to [stick by Nancy], there's no way around it. He's the manager, he's got his staff with him, we're players at this club. He's the one that's going to lead us into victories with whatever style and whatever management the way he wants.\n\n\"Once it clicks then we're hopefully thinking that's going to propel us into the performances we need and winning games most importantly.\"",

These North East neighbours have won only one major domestic trophy between them in the past 50 years, and Sunday's game (14:00 GMT) marks the first time they will even meet in the Premier League for nearly a decade.\n\nBut few fixtures bring a region to a standstill quite like the Tyne-Wear derby as former Sunderland manager Peter Reid knows better than most.\n\n\"They're football crackers,\" he said. \"Let's just say there is a little bit more needle up there.\"\n\nAnother Liverpudlian across the divide feels similarly before the game at the Stadium of Light.\n\nRyan Taylor, the last player to score a winning goal for Newcastle against Sunderland in the top flight back in 2011, likens the intensity of the rivalry to the Old Firm in Scotland.\n\n\"There is a hell of a lot more passion in this derby compared to the Manchester derby and, even the Merseyside derby,\" the retired defender said. \"There's just raw emotion.\"\n\nSuch fervour is one of the many reasons why the This is Wearside supporters group started planning their biggest ever flag display for the derby once Sunderland secured promotion via the play-offs in May.\n\nDedicated volunteers have been spending up to 12 hours a day preparing the mammoth operation in recent weeks.\n\nThat is how much this game means.\n\n\"It's going to be like two worlds colliding,\" said Daniel Stokell, the group's co-founder.",

    "description": "Alabama basketball couldn't compete on the glass against No. 1 ranked Arizona Saturday, lost in a rout, and Jimi Hendrix summed it up well.",
    "fullText": "BIRMINGHAM — The Jimi Hendrix rendition of \"All Along the Watchtower\" blasted loudly through Legacy Arena as the Alabama basketball team walked off the floor as losers of a blowout, summed up perfectly how the Crimson Tide must have been feeling.\n\nThere must be some way out of here, said the joker to the thief.\n\nThere’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief.\n\nAlabama was looking for a way out of the building as fast as possible, but have no confusion about this: Rebounding was the reason. Arizona 96, Alabama 75.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: Alabama basketball vs Arizona live updates, highlights from C.M. Newton Classic\n\nPushing the Crimson Tide (7-3) around under the basket is the book being written by opponents on this Nate Oats team, and it's not a first edition. It's been UA's undoing more often than not when things don't go well in the Oats era; the Wildcats — ranked No. 1 in the nation — were just the latest to expose it on Saturday night.\n\nArizona dominated the boards 52-32.\n\nThe neutral floor, of course, didn't sound neutral at all. A lively pro-Alabama crowd roared for about a half, until the top team in America started playing like it. By the end of a 28-6 Arizona run that took roughly nine minutes off the second-half clock, the outcome had been decided, fans at the BJCC were sitting on their hands, and the Crimson Tide's rebounders might as well have been doing the same.\n\nOf course, that 28-6 hammer, during which Oats stubbornly declined to call a timeout, was punctuated by more than just rebounding problems. The shooting went cold, the defense lapsed, and lest anyone forget, a Final-Four threat of an Arizona team just played some really good basketball. But nothing exposed where the Crimson Tide needs to improve more than the rebounding disparity. Arizona piled up 22 offensive rebounds to Alabama's three. That translated into 28 more field goal attempts for the Wildcats, which Oats lamented as the determining factor.\n\nIn one maddening sequence in the second half, Crimson Tide center Aiden Sherrell and forward Amari Allen blocked two shots in four seconds, but gave up five offensive rebounds on the same possession, ultimately yielding a layup for a 55-48 Arizona lead. Alabama's defense recorded a whopping 15 blocks, led by Sherrell's eight, but allowed far too many second and third shots to have a chance at upending the Wildcats.\n\nBeating Alabama up under the glass might be the right song for opponents, but only a few of them can sing it. The Crimson Tide's three losses have come at the hands of the nation's No. 1, No. 5 and No. 12 teams, but the same problem cropped up in all of them.\n\n\"This has been a recurring issue with us,\" Oats said. \"Purdue, I think we lost (in rebounding) by 24. Gonzaga beat us. When we've played these tough, physical teams, we haven't answered the bell real well on the glass.\"\n\nSEC play is three weeks away for Oats, and when it comes to rebounding woes, he must find a way out.\n\nTuscaloosa News columnist Chase Goodbread is also the weekly co-host of Crimson Cover TV on WVUA-23.

    "fullText": "Victor Wembanyama made a triumphant return from injury to lead the San Antonio Spurs to a stunning NBA Cup semi-final upset of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday as the New York Knicks downed the Orlando Magic to book their place in the final.\n\nFrench prodigy Wembanyama, who has missed the Spurs' last 12 games after suffering a left calf strain last month, produced a dominant performance at both ends of the court to set up a thrilling 111-109 victory at Las Vegas's T-Mobile Arena.\n\nThe 7ft 4in (2.24m) 21-year-old finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in 21 minutes on court, helping the Spurs climb out of a 16-point hole in the second quarter to inflict only the second Oklahoma City defeat this season.\n\nNBA champions Oklahoma City had gone into the game on the back of a 16-game winning streak, boasting a 24-1 record for the season that had prompted talk of them breaking Golden State's record 73-win season.\n\nBut after making a smooth start to control the game, Wembanyama began to make his presence felt off the bench in the second quarter to breathe new life into the San Antonio ranks.\n\n\"I knew I had limited minutes so I had to make the most out of it,\" Wembanyama said.\n\n\"Winning against a team like this, it might seem like it's just a game but it's a collective effort and it's not an easy thing.\n\n\"It's only their second loss of the season. It means something.\"\n\nWembanyama was one of four San Antonio players to finish with double figures, with Devin Vassell scoring 23, and Stephon Castle and De'Aaron Fox adding 22 apiece.\n\n\"It says a lot. And it says a lot about where this team is going to be in the future,\" he said.\n\nReigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder scoring with 29 points, while Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren added 17 points each.\n\nIn Saturday's other semi-final, Jalen Brunson scored 40 points to power the New York Knicks to their first NBA Cup final with a 132-120 win over the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe Knicks' in-form offense proved too hot for injury-hit Orlando as New York took their recent streak to nine wins from 10 games.\n\n\"We came out here and did exactly what we said we wanted to do, which was play Knicks basketball,\" said Karl-Anthony Towns, who backed Brunson with 29 points.\n\nThe Magic had led 36-33 after making a rapid start to a breathless opening quarter -- earning the Knicks players some harsh and fiery words from coach Mike Brown in an early timeout.\n\n\"The way they came out, physicality-wise, we weren't ready for it,\" said Brunson.\n\n\"We bounced back and responded to that, and the way we played the rest of the game is a testament to that first timeout.\"\n\nNew York went on a tear at the start of the second quarter, capitalizing on a missed floating jump shot from Desmond Bane to take the lead through Josh Hart.\n\nThe Knicks briefly relinquished their advantage soon after half-time, when Bane put the Magic back ahead with a running layup.\n\nBut Orlando ultimately could not keep pace with Brunson, who late in the third quarter left opposing guard Anthony Black sitting helplessly on the floor before executing a three-point step-back jumpshot.\n\nOrlando's Jalen Suggs managed a team-high 26 points, but failed to complete the game after suffering with an apparent injury to his left side.\n\nThe Magic also felt the absence of Franz Wagner, their leading scorer this season.\n\nThe NBA Cup, a mid-season knockout tournament now in its third year, is proving a hit with audiences and players.\n\nIt now offers a tantalizing opportunity for the Knicks to win their first overall trophy since 1973.",

    "description": "Another career night from AJ Dybantsa and strong bench contributions powered the Cougars past the Highlanders.",
    "fullText": "When BYU took the Marriott Center floor Saturday night, it was the Cougars’ first appearance at their home arena in 32 days.\n\nAnd what a 32 day stretch it was.\n\nOver that span, BYU hopped on three separate flights to the east coast and two bus trips up to Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Cougars played in six Quad 1 or 2 contests — winning five — and captured a Thanksgiving tournament championship in Florida.\n\nBYU took blue blood UConn down to the wire in Boston, blew out ranked foe Wisconsin at the Delta Center and stormed back to stun Clemson at the buzzer in New York City’s famed Madison Square Garden.\n\nAs eventful as the past 32 days were for the Cougars, it clearly made them a much better team, which was quite evident as BYU stomped UC Riverside 100-53 in Saturday’s long-awaited return to Provo.\n\n“I mean, this place always has energy,” BYU head coach Kevin Young said after the game. “That trip to New York (earlier this week) was great, but it was exhausting. We felt like we were there forever, honestly. We had a pretty exhausting day the day after the game. It took us an hour and 40 minutes to get to the airport, and then we had a five-hour flight.\n\n“It was a long day, so I was honestly a little worried about a letdown getting back home just in terms of like letting our guard down, but that was clearly not the case, so kudos to the guys to respond.”\n\nSuch a response came in the form of BYU’s best offensive showing of the young season, as it crossed the century mark in points and averaging a blistering 1.389 points per possession.\n\nHERE YOU GO @SportsCenter 🤯\n\n📺 ESPN+ | #SCTop10 pic.twitter.com/KQrpnstoyn\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) December 14, 2025\n\nAfter being plagued by slow starts throughout the year, the Cougars instead came out swinging to the tune of 49 first half points before pouring on another 51 after halftime.\n\n“We’re just trying to bring the mentality we have in second halves to the first half,” said AJ Dybantsa. “Obviously, we’ve been coming out pretty lazy. Our second halves have been good, so we just wanted to bring that same mentality to the first half.”\n\nThe Cougars shot 59.1% from the field and 47.4% from 3-point range, dishing out 22 collective assists, scoring 54 paint points, another 29 points in transition and even getting a season-high 36 points from their bench.\n\n“There were a couple of things we wanted to highlight or emphasize coming into this game, and the No. 1 thing offensively was just playing with the pass \n\n“... (We) subsequently had the most fast break points with 29 fast break points, which is easier to do when you’re getting stops obviously, and then 22 assists, you know, that’s more how we want to play, and I thought the guys were really good there.”\n\nFresh off his finest performance to date against Clemson earlier this week, Dybantsa dazzled yet again on his home floor, scoring a game-high 26 points on 11 of 17 shooting and setting new personal bests with eight rebounds, seven assists and five steals.\n\nAnd ever the finisher, 16 of his 26 points came in the second half.\n\nAJ DYBANTSA vs UC Riverside \n\n26 PTS | 8 REB | 7 AST | 0 PF pic.twitter.com/pysbEZ4v7y\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) December 14, 2025\n\n“It was ridiculous what he just did out there,” Young said of Dybantsa. “I mean, he had 26 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, five steals, one block, and probably could have had 50 (points), truly. He’s a special player. That was incredible what he was doing out there. I’m just incredibly impressed with what he did tonight and what he’s done all season. The kid’s good, man, and then everyone feeds off him.\n\n“... We’re gonna win a lot of games because of how good he is, but you know, it’s more about he’s good because he’s talented, but he’s a team guy. They’re hard to find, man. They’re really hard to find.”\n\nIn addition to Dybantsa, Richie Saunders posted 10 points in the game’s first four minutes to end up with a total of 19 points and five rebounds.\n\nRob Wright III scored nine points with six assists, and remaining starters Keba Keita and Kennard Davis Jr. teamed up for 10 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nhere's your regularly scheduled Keba rim rocker\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/NvGQo4A3XQ\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) December 14, 2025\n\nLeading BYU’s encouraging bench charge was backup point guard Aleksej Kostić, who drained five 3-pointers — including a heat check of three in a row in the first half — for 15 points, four assists and a plus/minus of +36 in 22 minutes to draw chants of his name from the ROC student section by game’s end.\n\n“His shot making is a beautiful thing. I mean, that’s why we brought him here,” Young said of Kostić. “We felt like it was a matter of time before he was able to have a game like he had tonight.\n\n“He’s kind of a hybrid between like Trevin (Knell) from last year and Dawson (Baker) because he can play with the ball a little bit more off the dribble, and if he can do that, man, that’s going to be obviously a huge weapon for us. Especially when we sub Rob out, he can do that next to AJ. I like that pairing.”\n\nKostić was joined in his bench excellence by redshirt freshman Khadim Mboup, who notched his first career double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nBut Kostić’s night carries a great deal of significance — having the Austrian newcomer serve as BYU’s ball-handling and sharpshooting option off the bench going forward would be massive in filling the crucial role left by previous sixth man Baker following his season-ending knee injury.\n\n“I always try to stay ready, and when I come in the game, try to shoot. I wouldn’t say it was something different that I did today. I just shoot the ball, and today I made a lot,” Kostić said.\n\n“... It’s of course, very sad that we lose a player like Dawson. They told me that I will have a bigger role, and I’ll try to stay ready and step in his footsteps.”\n\nBYU, now 9-1 on the season and 3-0 at home, will be back at the Marriott Center Tuesday night to face former WCC foe Pacific in the Cougars’ third-to-last contest before the start of Big 12 play in January.",

    "fullText": "MANDEVILLE, La. (WGNO) — Once Mandeville defensive end Nick Ingram got to high school, he hit the books just like he hits the opposition. It paid off, as he has a 4.62 GPA and a score of 34 on the ACT.\n\n“In junior high, I was not very focused on school. But in high school, I really started focusing on my academics,” Ingram said. “Looking at where I am today, I am proud of what I have done. My GPA, my test scores, all that stuff.”\n\nIngram is an AP scholar with multiple outstanding student awards. His academic success stems from making the classroom his top priority.\n\n“Academics are very important to me. As important as football, if not more important,” Ingram said. “If you have a 2.0 GPA, you’re not going to get into a great school since you don’t have the academics for it.”\n\nIngram’s intelligence has also translated to the trenches.\n\n“Nick helps us get lined up in formation. Makes our checks on defense in the box with the front six, he’s been very helpful there,” Mandeville head coach Craig Jones said.\n\nNick is uncertain of where he’ll attend college, but his work as president of the Mandeville youth and government program has helped pave the way for a bright future.\n\n“I think I’ll double major in political science and public policy. It’ll allow me to go into a field with law, so I will probably go to law school afterwards,” Ingram said.\n\nMandeville’s Nick Ingram is our Friday Night Football Scholar Athlete of the Week, brought to you by your Southern Quality Ford Dealers.\n\nStay up to date with the latest news, weather and sports by downloading the WGNO app on the Apple or Google Play stores and by subscribing to the WGNO newsletter.\n\nFNF Southern Quality Ford Dealers Scholar-Athlete of the Week: Mandeville’s Nick Ingram\n\nFNF: Andre Anthony reflects on incredible year-one run as Bonnabel head coach\n\nFNF Championship: No. 14 Ouachita Parish upsets top-seeded Ruston, 21-20, to win Division I Non-Select title\n\nEarly morning showers & storms followed by gusty winds for Sunday\n\nPowerball: Here are the winning numbers for the $1B jackpot",

    "fullText": "Well, here it is folks – the game we’ve all been ‘looking forward to’. Putting aside all of the noise surrounding the fixture, it’s going to be intriguing from a team selection persepective as to how Regis Le Bris approaches this game. Will we attack from the off or will we try to to soak up their energy before countering? Will we go five at the back or will we be confident in a four? How will our young players adapt to the atmosphere? Loads of questions to be answered during the course of the game – but here’s how I think we’ll go into the match today.\n\nRoefs has been exceptional this season, and his ability to claim the ball in his box will be vital today.\n\nI think we’ll go with a back four today, as we won’t want to give Newcastle a numerical advantage in midfield – that said, I think it’ll be a fluid formation that will enable us to switch with ease. Reinildo’s back after missing City, which is great news, and I think we’ll see Nordi at right back, with Ballard and Alderete in the centre of the defence.\n\nXhaka and Sadiki thankfully came through the City game, and they’ll line up in the centre of midfield – with Le Fee in there too. I think Le Fee’s all round game will be important today and we’ll see him in the thick of the action. The wings are interesting – I have a feeling we’ll see a surprise here, with Trai Hume replicating the role he did later on against Bournemouth and at Liverpool, which gives us strength in front of Mukiele and a bit more protection for Le Fee, too. On the other wing, I’m taking a flyer here and going with Simon Adingra – he’s been left out of the AFCON squad and will have a point to prove. Talbi’s looked a bit indifferent out there in recent games and it’s probably too big an occasion for Mundle to start, so I’m thinking Adingra might get the nod today.\n\nThis is a tough one to call as there are compelling arguments for both Brobbey and Isidor to start – however I think Brobbey’s strength and experience will get the nod to start, with the plan of Isidor coming on for the last 30 against tiring legs. We’ll see…",

    "description": "Who would have thought at 2-0 down to Swansea that a year on it would be time for a Wear-Tyne derby?",
    "fullText": "Christmas comes earlier every year supposedly, but for Sunderland fans it currently feels as if the club is light years on from where it was 12 months ago, when a remarkable come from behind win against Swansea City had us all in raptures.\n\nWe are just 365 days on from that trip to Wales but compare the squad from that match with the team now expected to line up against Newcastle United this afternoon and you will get a real sense for the rate of progress since then. At best there will be three, but most likely fewer, players still involved in the starting XI that were around last season, but whilst some of their old teammates have since dropped out of the picture their roles were essential at the time.\n\nThe promotion winners of 2024-25 helped usher in a new sense of hope at SAFC that has supporters looking very much ahead. It wasn’t all that long ago that people were unsure of what to make of head coach Régis Le Bris however, with the summer appointment experiencing a loss of momentum in the build-up to Last Christmas.\n\nPrior to that, the Lads had been flying under their new French connector. Four Championship wins out of four, with just one goal conceded during the run, had Sunderland leading the fledgling table and it wasn’t until a run of five successive draws that they fell out of the automatic spots. An unfortunate defeat to fellow promotion hopefuls Sheffield United then cast further doubt on the push, with some wondering if Le Bris had just been enjoying a touch of ‘beginners luck’ – only for their fears to be eased when the team showed real determination to see off Stoke City in filthy weather conditions and then grab an equaliser against Bristol City a couple of days after.\n\nPatrick Robert’s last gasp leveller against the Robins certainly set things up nicely ahead of a game with the Swans, but for all it was celebrated that fight-back soon paled into insignificance in terms of drama when put up against the resurgence seen in Glamorgan – Le Bris’ men proving beyond all doubt that they had the mental strength needed to achieve their aims.\n\nThe Jacks had initially taken an early lead through Zan Vipotnik, who capitalised on some defensive hesitancy to score from close range. Having then tested Anthony Patterson, Liam Cullen added a second less than 20 minutes in with a free kick to leave shell shocked Sunderland looking very uncertain, but it wasn’t long before they pulled themselves round – and getting back into things before half-time handed them a vital lifeline.\n\nDan Ballard did well to angle a header into the net as he connected with a set piece that had been whipped into the box by Trai Hume, and once the break was over the Lads started moving building up a head of steam. Now looking more composed and able to push men forward, a string of chances was created before Dan Neil levelled things up with a screamer. Collecting the ball from Jobe, the captain drove through the middle of the park before firing in an unstoppable 20-yard effort, and whilst he was keen to get back on with the action as soon as possible the celebrations that followed the next goal were much more prolonged.\n\nSwansea were the ones that were rocking now, but unlike their opponents they were unable to gather themselves and just two minutes on from Neil’s excellent solo strike they found themselves behind, albeit this Sunderland goal was via an excellent team move. Hume, Patrick Roberts and Chris Rigg worked down the right-hand side before the ball was put on a plate for Jobe to smash past Lawrence Vigouroux, and with the turn around complete wild scenes behind the goal followed.\n\nWith the players as ecstatic as the supporters the ‘limbs’ shown suggested that everybody in red and white knew that this was big. The three points were a massive confidence boost and helped keep the squad in the promotion frame, making this game a pivotal step towards what came afterwards. Since plunging into League One many players have come and gone, and whilst several of them failed to make an impact the ones that did aid the revival will always be valued. Jon McLaughlan for example, an unused substitute for Swansea on this day, did what he could, and the ones that built on that to deliver two promotions and get the club back to where it now is did so, like they did in Wales, by keeping going Til The End…\n\nSwansea City 2 (Vipotnik 5’, Cullen 17’)\n\nSunderland 3 (Ballard 28’, Neil 73’, Jobe 75’)\n\nSunderland: Patterson; Hume, Mepham, Ballard, Cirkin (O’Nien 70’); Rigg, Neil, Jobe; Roberts, Isidor, Mayenda Unused: Moore, Hjelde, Alese, Jones, Aleksić, Aouchiche, Rusyn, Connolly.\n\nSwansea.com Stadium, attendance 15,791",

    "description": "Mark Wood pays tribute to club legend Gary Rowell, whose sad passing was announced last night.",
    "fullText": "At Roker Report, we have put together a number of tributes to ex-players and club legends down the years, but this feels like one of the most difficult.\n\nGary Rowell was a true club legend, and his hat-trick at St. James Park will forever be cemented in club folklore.\n\nHe had earned a legendary status among my own generation of Sunderland fans who saw him play, which he carried on long after he hung up his boots.  His death at a way too early 68 years old, announced in the late hours of Saturday evening and on the eve of the first Wear-Tyne derby for almost 10 years, is sad news for all Sunderland fans.\n\nWhile the man will be mourned among the fanbase, he left us with some of the most amazing memories in a red and white shirt.\n\nGary Rowell was Sunderland through and through. Born in Seaham, he came through the ranks at the club, first making a few appearances for Bob Stokoe’s promotion-winning side of 1976 before making his breakthrough as a first-team regular the following season.\n\nAs Sunderland toiled desperately at the foot of the First Division, the new manager Jimmy Adamson called on the youth of Gary, Shaun Elliott and Kevin Arnott to form a new midfield which nearly and so spectacularly saved the club from relegation.\n\nAlthough playing in midfield at this point in his career, Gary, as well as having an eye for a pass, also weighed in with some crucial goals,notably in a 4-0 win against Middlesbrough, a 6-1 win against West Brom, and a 6-0 win against West Ham.  All in consecutive home games.\n\nThe following season, he began to operate in a more advanced role and began to make a name for himself as a goal scorer – 19 in all competitions -, but his career really began to take off in the 1978-79 season.  Twenty-four goals in thirty-nine appearances – and one game Sunderland fans will remember forever.  24 February 1979 at St. James Park. Sunderland win 4-1 and Gary Rowell scored a hattrick.\n\nA bad injury a few weeks later somewhat interrupted his progress, and some might say took away some of his pace, but when he did come back into the first team, Sunderland were back in the top flight, and Gary had not lost any of his prowess in front of goal.  From the summer of 1980 to the summer of 1984, he was the club’s leading goal scorer in each season, and from 1977-78 to 1984, he was the club’s leading scorer in each season bar one.  There was another hat-trick against Arsenal along the’ way, and it’s fair to say that those goals did so much to keep Sunderland in the First Division.\n\nHe was also a penalty taker of some repute and only ever missed one in 26 attempts.  Watching him take a penalty you could see why – he was very cool, and hit them low, hard and into the corner, a technique which even many of the very best players would love to master.\n\nAll in all, Gary Rowell hit 103 goals in 297 games for Sunderland and it was a complete shock to all fans when he was released by the club at just 26 years of age.\n\nHe still had a couple of outstanding memories to share with Sunderland fans after he left.\n\nThe first was in the League Cup Final of 1985 at Wembley when he was a Norwich player – although injured – he walked around the pitch at the final whistle with the celebrating Norwich squad, but paused in front of the Sunderland fans to chat and sign autographs with them and donned a Sunderland scarf.  He looked for all the world like he wanted to be standing on the terraces with us.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I wrote a ‘Sunderland Great’ article which featured him, and while researching it, I saw a thread mentioning that he had not been well, which I and everyone who got wind of it hoped was not true. Unfortunately, it transpired it was.\n\nIt is awfully sad news, but despite the loss we feel as fans the thoughts of everyone should be with his family.\n\nThe second memory is also from the ‘Sunderland Great’ article and one that sums up the man.\n\nMay 5, 1996, and Peter Reid’s Sunderland are at Tranmere, riding the crest of a wave, confirmed as champions with the fans in full voice.\n\nMidway through the second half and from my seat among the home support I see the whole of the Sunderland support in the stand to my right turn around singing to one guy half way up. ’We all live in a Gary Rowell World’.\n\nAnd it is him, sitting and giving a big grin and a cheery wave back. He absolutely loved it, and while not being at St. James that day but despite witnessing who knows how many of his goals, it is the memory of him I’ll take all day long. Sat in the middle of the Sunderland fans, loving being the centre of attention with a great big smile on his face.\n\nThe Sunderland fans would sing ‘ Gary Rowell is Magic’. He was. Gary Rowell was completely bloody magic.  He’ll be sorely missed, but never forgotten.",

We’ve played them in the play-offs in the past, and when both sides have been struggling at the wrong end of the table, but today feels like a victory would feel hugely symbolic.\n\nNewcastle fans were likely feeling comfortable that we wouldn’t be around to compete for a long time to come. Still, the accelerated progress has led us from League One play-offs to competing as equals in under four years, and we’re making the most of it. Whatever happens, we know we’re back, but it would be the cherry on top of a stupidly big sundae if we collect three points today.\n\nWe’ve mentioned our unbeaten record at home, and Eddie Howe’s side had a timely reminder of what it feels like to win on the road a fortnight ago – as they beat a very poor Everton for their first win away from home this season. Three draws and three defeats make up the other six, and it remains their weakness on paper this season.\n\nThe expectations were high after collecting more than half the total of our summer outlay from Liverpool for Isak, but three wins in the first eleven fell short of what they hoped. Three wins and a draw in the last four have improved the picture, but they didn’t have it all their own way at home to Burnley last weekend, and the trip to Germany with Bayer Leverkusen scoring a late equaliser.\n\nHowever, that occurrence in midweek isn’t anything new, with Newcastle conceding nine goals in the final ten minutes of games in all competitions this season. The goal in Germany had the players, manager, and pundits all questioning their mentality.\n\nWith the effort of midweek and the visit of Chelsea at the weekend, and a trip to Old Trafford coming quickly after that, they’ll know that their biggest test out of those could be today.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 9/4 to win the game, while that lot are priced at 6/5, and the draw is 9/4.\n\n[Ballard (OG) 35’, Isak 46’, 90’ (pen)]\n\nSunderland: Patterson, Hume, O’Nien, Ballard, Alese, Ekwah, Neil, Pritchard, Bellingham, Clarke, Rusyn (Ba) Substitutes not used: Bishop, Pembele, Seelt, Triantis, Rigg, Aouchiche, Hemir, Burstow\n\nNewcastle United: Dubravka, Trippier, Burn (Dummett), Guimaraes, Schar (Lascelles), Botman, Almiron (Livramento), Longstaff, Isak, Joelinton (Miley), Gordon (Ritchie) Substitutes not used: Karius, Krafth, Hall\n\nWell, it’s usually a choice between 2-1 or 3-0… so I’m going 2-1.",

    "title": "Nevada Survives Another Nail Biter in 78-75 Win over Duquesne",
    "description": "Another down to the wire game, and now it’s time for conference play.",
    "fullText": "Nevada hosted Duquesne on Saturday night, a game that wasn’t 100 percent guaranteed to happen. A power outage hit the north side of campus, which included Lawlor Events Center. The outage forced the Nevada women’s game to go into a no-contest and there was uncertainty if it would be back on in time for the men’s tip-off.\n\nLuckily, power was restored, and a win was granted to Nevada, beating Duquesne 78-75 in another nail-biter that came down to the wire. This game was a constant momentum shift, with both sides trading off dominant runs and long scoring droughts.\n\nNevada was playing behind to start, but Chuck Bailey was keeping Nevada in it early on. Six of Nevada’s eight early points came from Bailey inside.\n\nThe offense took advantage of the Duke’s scoring drought, going on a 15-0 run that included a three-pointer by Peyton White, giving Nevada its first lead of the game. White hit a mid-range jumper followed by three from Amire Robinson, giving Nevada a quick seven point lead in a matter of minutes.\n\nNevada’s offense just kept on pounding. A 25-6 run over a span of 10 minutes helped give the Wolf Pack a lead as high as 14 points toward the end of the first half. Nearly half of Nevada’s points in that first half came from inside the paint as it took a 42-35 lead into halftime. Nevada also shot over 50 percent from the field in the first half.\n\nA hot start to the second half for Duquesne was a cold one for Nevada. The Pack collected eight points to open up before hitting a scoring drought, allowing Duquesne to close within a few points. The drought lasted a little over three minutes before freshman Myles Walker hit a three to extend the game to 53-49.\n\nIt was off and on for Nevada’s offense from there, which allowed the Dukes to tie and then take the lead on a Nevada scoring drought that lasted over three minutes. A free throw by Elijah Price and a layup by Tayshawn Comer allowed Nevada to retake a slim 72-71 lead with 1:13 to go.\n\nIt came down to free throws, which Nevada made 24-32 to seal a close 78-75 win. Nevada went 7-8 from the free-throw line in the final minute of the half to seal its eighth win.\n\n“What can you say about your freshmen, Myles [Walker] and Peyton [White], who continue to make veteran plays,” Alford said. “That was a highly contested game, down to the wire, and you got two freshmen going to the line the last two trips and go 4-4 at the line, that’s big time.”\n\nDuquesne opened up the game with two quick threes on some missed defensive switches for Nevada. There were two quick turnovers for the Pack in the first seven minutes of the half that turned into six points for the Dukes.\n\nAfter going up by eight for a 16-8 lead, Duquesne went on a scoring drought of over five minutes. The Dukes also gave up three turnovers in that span. They broke out of the dry spell just under the 10-minute mark with another shot beyond the arc.\n\nDuquesne closed the gap a bit but didn’t shoot the best in the first half, going 36 percent from the field and 39 percent from beyond the arc. Guards Tarence Guinyard and Jimmie Williams both collected double digits in that first half, but the rest of the Duke’s offense was slow. Guinyard ended the night as the Dukes’ lead scorer with 21 points on 5-11 shooting.\n\nThe Dukes opened the second half with much more pace, leading to a 7-0 run before Nevada had to take a timeout.\n\nIt was much more tight-knit within the final 10 minutes, as both sides traded momentum. With 2:04 to go, Duquesne made a three to tie the game at 69 and used a turnover to take the lead in the middle of a 9-0 run. All in all, Nevada’s defense may have played hot potato, but it closed it out when it needed to. Duquesne finished shooting 39 percent from the field and 33 from three.\n\n“I didn’t think our start and finish in the first half was very good defensively,” head coach Steve Alford said. “In the middle, it was really good, and then to start the second half was bad, but we closed out some good stops.”\n\nNevada will begin conference play next weekend, and it’ll do it from the comfort of its own home. The Wolf Pack will host rival Boise State on Saturday, Dec. 20, at Lawlor. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. PST.\n\nThe Broncos are coming off a dominant win over Duquesne a week ago and will be playing St Mary’s tomorrow night.\n\n“Beat ‘em [Boise State],” Amire Robinson said about what the mindset is going into the first conference game of the year. “We didn’t come out good against Duquesne, and they beat Duquesne pretty good, so we got to shove back and really kill them this time.”",

    "fullText": "My first ever Sunderland game was on 24 February 2002 — a Wear-Tyne Derby.\n\nThis was the first game my father brought me to and I recall the build up like it happened yesterday. The face paint, putting on my Sunderland jersey with “Phillips” on the back (because the club shop had run out of the numbers 1 and 0!) and the increasing sense of trepidation and anticipation as the kick off time approached.\n\nWe lost that game 0-1 due to the magnificent performance of Shay Given in the Newcastle goal, and it crushed me as an Irish goalkeeper destroyed a little eight year old Irish boy’s dreams on his first trip to Sunderland.\n\nThe heartbreak didn’t last too long, as like the resilient Sunderland fan I’ve become, you learn to grudgingly accept defeat and chase that next high; the next opportunity to roar, to celebrate a goal and to hug the ones close to you when these moments occur.\n\nAs some may already know, I’m not from the area nor the country, but my passion for this club goes back to the beginning of my supporting days back in 2002.\n\nIt was the way the people made me feel on my first trip with the Irish Sunderland Supporters Club, as it was then. How the Belfast branch dressed me up for the occasion with their face paint and scarves, and how I would readily begin a conversation with anyone in the city who would talk Sunderland AFC with me.\n\nThe Sunderland AFC I knew back then was lost along the way — through chaos, decline and ridicule — but it’s fought its way back to become something we can believe in again.\n\nToday, my father and I will fly from Dublin to see our team take on their greatest enemy almost twenty five years on from that trip, and we’ll be there with immense pride in where Kyril Louis-Dreyfus, Kristjaan Speakman and Régis Le Bris have brought the club in such a short space of time.\n\nFor years, this club has been the butt of a joke, the laughing stock of the football community and Netflix’s black comedy success story, but that Sunderland is well and truly gone.\n\nIn many ways, this edition of the derby is an opportunity for the players but especially the fans to announce that we aren’t the jokers anymore. It’s another opportunity for this club to show that it belongs here and to seize the moment and the occasion.\n\nWe’re a proud fanbase but we’re also a fanbase that’ll back our players to the hilt once we see the effort on the pitch. Today, we must match the effort on the pitch with noise that’ll rattle in the stands and that a young kid will remember for a lifetime — just like I did twenty five years ago.\n\nDespite my confident prediction that we’ll win, today is another chapter on the new story of Sunderland AFC. It could be the day that a new generation of fans will be hooked by this incredible football club, and it’s a day to make new memories.\n\nLong after the result is forgotten, it won’t be the scoreline that remains.\n\nInstead, it’ll be the walk to the ground, the nervous laughter, the roar that shakes your chest, and the arms you find yourself wrapped in when the ball hits the Newcastle net. This is what a derby is — memories passed from one generation to the next. And today, once again, we go to make another one.",

    "description": "Roker Report reader Keith Davison has shared his memories of Gary Rowell with us.",
    "fullText": "Gary Rowell’s greatest moment was probably the hat trick he scored against Newcastle in a 4-1 win for the Lads away at Sid James Park.\n\nIn 1979 I was just a naïve teenager scared of my own shadow and definitely scared of football ‘hooligans’. But football was my obsession, and when my older and much more street-wise brother (who had a bit of hooligan experience himself) suggested that the best way to watch the derby at Sid James was to go incognito amongst the bar codes, I jumped at the idea.\n\nWe’d then be able to travel to and from the ground amongst them and be safer than if we went in the away end and then had to get away home as being obviously from Sunderland.\n\nYounger readers will be shocked to hear that in those days you could just turn up to a ground on the day of the match and pay at the gate. No all-ticket matches, no purchase history required, no BCPs. This was a reasonable enough idea and did work in terms of getting us to the game safely.\n\nWhat we hadn’t contemplated and planned for was the Lads winning 4-1 and Lord Rowell scoring a hat trick.\n\nYou can imagine what the atmosphere was like among the mags at seeing their team dismantled by Rowell that day with a clinical display of finishing. You will also be able to imagine what it was like to be a Sunderland supporter being amongst this angry mob and not being able to celebrate.\n\nI was later to discover that at 4-1 up Rowell had a discussion with Kevin Arnott about whether to go for a 5th goal or to just to take the piss. Apparently they decided to take the piss and annoy the locals more. Thanks lads.\n\nAnyway, we did make it out of the ground safely and went back to the multi-storey car park where we had parked up. We got into the car park lift alongside an old couple returning from a shopping trip, and finally, much to their shock, we were able to celebrate the Lads’ success properly after 90 minutes of bottling it up. They must have thought we were crackers.\n\nWhen I think of Rowell I find it difficult to describe him and his attributes. He wasn’t fast and skilful like Marco, he couldn’t dribble around teams like McGeady or even Nedum Onuoha. He wasn’t a tackler like Cattermole or Bally.\n\nWhat he did do was score goals. He always seemed to be in the right place or just be able to create the right amount of space to get a shot away. He never seemed to blast the ball into the net – it was always more of a pass right into the corner of the net and out of the keeper’s reach. I don’t recall him scoring many spectacular goals – I just remember him scoring lots of goals.\n\nI remember when he first came into the team I thought he was just going to be a fairly steady midfield player. He didn’t particularly stand out, but gradually, as Stokoe began to shake up the cup-winning team from 1973, and then Stokoe himself left, Rowell went from being a bit-part player to our leading man and top goal scorer. When he was joined in the first team by Arnott and Elliott the sudden burst of youthful enthusiasm totally revived the team.\nI never met the man, but nothing I have heard about him would lead me to think anything other of him than – Gary Rowell, a true Sunderland legend, one of our own, and a boyhood hero of my generation.",

    "description": "It’s the big one. The game we’ve all been waiting for: Newcastle at home. Time to step up, Lads!",
    "fullText": "Score prediction: Sunderland 2 Newcastle 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Granit Xhaka\n\nA big, big day on Wearside. This is a huge game in our resurgence — and a win here could be the cherry on top of what’s been an exceptional 2025.\n\nIt’ll be a tough game, but I’m hoping beyond hope that we can get the win today, which will be worth more than three points.\n\nFirst scorer? Xhaka to lead by example in a tense, tight and nervy win.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Newcastle 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Wilson Isidor\n\nThe Lads have had a full week off to rest, recover and train ready for today. They’ll be ready for battle and baying for blood after the disappointment of a 3-0 loss away to Manchester City last weekend.\n\nThat passion for victory should especially be the case against this collection of over-entitled pond life, who seem to think since winning the League Cup, they’re even more of “the dog’s nob” than before, and it’s our turn to wake up this bunch of self indulgent, tree-felling, oppressive-regime-loving saddos.\n\nWe’re back, we’re on the up, and you’re next. Can you deal with the 2025/2026 version of Sunderland AFC? I don’t think so.\n\nMonologues aside, Newcastle have had a wee resurgence of late, closing the points gap behind us well, but they’ll be tired from their midweek Champions League game and I’m sure they’ll have absolutely no idea about the wall of red and white which is about to hit them at 100mph.\n\nIsidor is going to get our first for me, using his pace against a less-than-mobile backline — including Dan “The Tanker” Burn.\n\nDan Ballard will get a second early in the second half to get his own back for that deflected own goal in the cup game, and we’ll cruise the rest of the game without incident, wondering what all the fuss was about.\n\nI’ve manifested it, lads. Go and do it. It’s nothing less than you’re capable of.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 3 Newcastle 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Enzo Le Fée\n\nAre you nervous yet? Because they are.\n\nIt’s to our great credit that we go into this game one point ahead of our rivals and I’m sure that despite the usual nonsense spouted, they know they’re coming into a real game after a slow start to their Premier League season.\n\nI expect it to be a physical, fast-paced affair. They like to mix it (see also: “cheat”) and can break with speed, so our midfield maestro Granit Xhaka will be pivotal in keeping us organised and driving us on against a set of robust players.\n\nAnother tiring trip for Newcastle in midweek to drop points again at Bayer Leverkusen will have taken its toll, and we have to take full advantage of that. Having Noah Sadiki and his outrageous energy against a team who’ve already played once this week looks even more dangerous now — thank the red and white gods that those yellow cards were avoided.\n\nI fancy Le Fée to follow in the footsteps of Patrice Carteron and Djibril Cissé, with a tenacious display and a sumptuous goal to go with it.\n\nThe Stadium of Light has proved a fortress so far this season but on Sunday, we prepare for war.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Newcastle 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Noah Sadiki\n\nAll the noise this week has been from them: excuses, downplaying it and pretending they’re not rattled. But they know exactly what’s waiting at 2:00pm: a Stadium of Light that’s been itching for this.\n\nWe look built for this battle; Granit Xhaka running the show, Dan Ballard and Omar Alderete as solid as granite, and Noah Sadiki ready to outrun every black and white shirt in sight. Hit them early, win the duels, keep the tempo high, and this is our game to grab.\n\nI fancy Sadiki to spark it off: press, pinch it, slot it, bedlam.\n\nDerbies come down to desire. And this time, it’s our lads who want it more.\n\nScore prediction: Newcastle 2 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Dan Ballard\n\nForget the years spent lost in the doldrums of League One. Forget the sneering Mags who laughed at our misfortune and forget the 0-3 in the FA Cup, because this time, we meet them as equals.\n\nThe superiority complex runs deep on the dark side of the North East and the narrative is that this is their “third most important game of the week”.\n\nThat’s fine. Underestimate us at your peril, because I have no doubt these lads know exactly what this means to the fans.\n\nThis is their chance to write themselves into folklore and to become heroes on Wearside.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 5 Newcastle 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Dan Ballard\n\nWe’re going to come out all guns blazing and score three before Newcastle actually realise they’re playing.\n\nThey’ll come out in the second half the better team, score a goal, and Granit Xhaka will rally the troops to punish them further until the ninetieth minute.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Newcastle 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Dan Ballard\n\nForm and league position can go in the bin — it’s ninety minutes decided by who wants it more, a bit of quality, and a bit of luck.\n\nFor occasions like this, we have the players I want in my team: Granit Xhaka, Dan Ballard, Omar Alderete, Nordi Mukiele, Reinildo, Noah Sadiki…and I could go on.\n\nI have full confidence in the Lads that they understand the importance of this game and how much it means to the fans and the city. And they’ll certainly feel that on the day, just when they thought they understood.\n\nAs long as they show the unwavering commitment on the pitch that we’ve seen already, and strike a balance with their emotions, I believe we’ll win this match.\n\nBallard getting the first goal would be immense and a signal of how far he’s grown since the last time.\n\nThe Mags don’t get to play this fixture down now it’s here and tell us we are over the top, whilst it’s not as big a game for them — you’re not fooling us.\n\nThere’s too many receipts out there, and we’re here to collect.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 3 Newcastle 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Granit Xhaka\n\nThe boys did OK for the first third of the game at Manchester City, but when we were undone by a deflection and then a set piece, it rapidly became clear this run was simply too much with tough games in quick succession. The third City goal was quality that we simply can’t argue against. Lovely stuff — sadly against us and not by us.\n\nWe had some great chances for Enzo Le Fée, Granit Xhaka and Wilson Isidor and on another day, two or even all three of them would’ve gone in rather than narrowly missing, hitting the woodwork or being saved.\n\nIt was a step too far to face Liverpool and City away and so close to each other, but we left with our heads held high, and now we need to focus on the big one.\n\nMost of the lads went for either a loss or a draw, with the odd outlier, which brought in just a few points for a few of the team.\n\nNo points for first scorer as nobody went for a loss to nil, either.\n\nMinor moves in the table only, with only four points between sixth place and top.\n\nFour points is exactly what you get for the right score and first scorer.\n\nEasy for anyone to rally across Christmas, then!\n\nJust a quick reminder of how we allocate points to our match-by-match predictions:\n\nCorrect outcome (but not correct score) = One point\n\nCorrect first Sunderland goalscorer = One point (no goalscorer is a valid call)\n\nPossible deductions for being lazy and not submitting on time = a two-point deduction.",

    "fullText": "A Premier League player has been tipped to join Chelsea now very soon in a move that could see one in and one out.\n\nThe news comes off the back of Chelsea getting back to winning ways yesterday afternoon by beating Everton 2-0 in the Premier League. It was a game that many Blues fans had been fearing due to a rough run of form lately.\n\nThere was a bizarre reaction from Enzo Maresca after the game when he complained about the lack of support that he has been receiving lately, the worst he has experienced since he’s been at the club according to the gaffer.\n\nIt was Malo Gusto who grabbed the decisive second goal in the game to finish things off in what was a fine overall display from the right back yesterday.\n\nAnd now, another player is being tipped to join this squad under Maresca.\n\nKobbie Mainoo with a Chelsea and Man U logo. (Photo by Ben Roberts Photo/Getty Images)\n\nFormer Everton CEO Keith Wyness told Football Insider he’s heard Manchester United are lining up a one in, one out swap of two England internationals:\n\n“I think it’s very unfair and I think that Mainoo, look, he’s a squandered talent in that sense. I just don’t think he’s, for some reason, he hasn’t caught [Ruben] Amorim’s eye. He thinks he doesn’t fit the style.\n\n“I think that they decided that Adam Wharton is going to be one of their targets and I think that Mainoo may find himself reinventing himself at Chelsea.\n\n“That’s where I see the situation going and that’s the whispers I’ve been hearing. I think it would be good for Mainoo. I think he needs to get out of there and move forward.”",

    "description": "Liverpool’s head coach was upbeat following their 2-nil victory over Brighton.",
    "fullText": "It’s been sometime since Liverpool have felt like the play and results have felt like they were reflective of defending champions. With their comprehensive 2-nil victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday, Liverpool can not only claim back-to-back victories, but also point to a current streak of 5 matches unbeaten.\n\nFor head coach Arne Slot, it’s clear that while the point is to bring victories, being able to keep the opposition out of the goal is a prime objective. So, it’s unsurprising that Slot would have mentioned keeping this clean sheet – and the others within this solid run for the Reds – within the remarks he gave following the match.\n\n“In my opinion, we are starting to play better and better on the ball as well. And from the last five games we’ve played, we kept three clean sheets and that is something to build on, especially after conceding four against PSV [Eindhoven] and three against Nottingham Forest.”\n\nLots of talk has surrounded the club, especially through the difficult stretch they seem to be climbing out of, with much of it focusing on the seeming difficulty of the coaching staff to find the right balance between defense and attack given the new offensive weapons acquired during the transfer windows. If this match were to serve as an indicator of progress on that project, though, the boss would have you think there’s more work to be done.\n\n“That’s funny, this is what people now say if you win 2-0 and then all of a sudden we were solid. But I think we conceded in one game more than we did in the last four games. But now all of a sudden it’s solid because we won the game. And when we had a draw or are conceding in the last minute against Leeds, I assume that people weren’t as positive as after this game.”\n\nWhile it might seem harsh to assess what felt a solid victory as something that should be improved, the stats say the boss isn’t far off. According to Opta, the xG battle actually went – ever so marginally – towards Brighton, with a draw being a pretty fair assessment based on the data set.\n\nLiverpool fans, though, would have found it rather harsh given how well the team looked moving forward with scuffed chances from Mohamed Salah among them. And speaking of the Egyptian goalscorer, it was inevitable given the past week that Slot would be asked about the relationship with Mo. The Dutchman gave a straightforward refusal to get drawn in, though, opting to toe a line that expressed clear respect and admiration but provided nothing in terms of specifics on the current state of things.\n\n“I think the reason why he wasn’t in Milan was his interview and the question is always – and everybody has a different opinion about that – should he be once, twice, three times, four times, four months, 12 years… every manager makes [a] different decision in that. He wasn’t involved in the game against Milan, I spoke to him yesterday and usually I never say anything about what we talk about, I am not going to make an exception now but I think actions speak louder than what has been said. He was in the squad again and when I had to make my first substitution, I brought him in and he performed as I think every fan – including me – would like him to perform today.”\n\nAll told, it’s the type of professional media appearance you’d expect from a top-flight manager. Slot has come in for a lot of criticism over the past week with some it being warranted and a surprising amount seeming to be pot-shots at a coach trying to manage a grieving football club through a difficult patch on the pitch. It is not an excuse for the poor results, but it certainly helps me to maintain a certain perspective on Slot and the lads; that this season is a gift and the matches will be opportunities for the squad to band closer together.\n\nIt’s not the most rigorous approach to sport and fandom, but with a Premier League trophy in tow and the weight of losing a friend overshadowing things, I’m having a hard time mustering up too much angst – even when things were going wrong. I’m happy for every day we get to see this group and, in particular, the opportunity to watch the remnants of Klopp’s core try to figure out if they’ve got one more evolution in them.\n\nI’ve counted this team out before and they’ve managed to surprise. Maybe, this season, it’ll all click and we’ll get a run of form to rival anything we’ve seen before. But on the off-chance that doesn’t happen, I’m just glad this team is trending in the right direction. Progress. That’s all I need.",

    "description": "This is pretty high praise for a rookie.",
    "fullText": "76ers rookie named one of best NBA players under 25 years old originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne thing that the Philadelphia 76ers have been able to do relatively well over the past decade or so is infusing the roster with young talent.\n\nBack in 2017, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were both ranked highly on ESPN’s list of the top NBA players under 25 years old. Embiid ranked No. 4 on the list that year, and Simmons placed 10th.\n\nLast year, guard Tyrese Maxey came in at No. 6 on The Ringer’s iteration of the top players under 25 list. This year, it’s V.J. Edgecombe’s turn. Philadelphia’s prized rookie was recently ranked by ESPN as the 19th-best player under 25.\n\n\"While there have been some predictable rookie growing pains, Edgecombe has largely rewarded the 76ers' decision to pick him third, with his explosiveness attacking the paint and flashes of defensive playmaking that point to major long-term upside. The future of the franchise rests on Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey, and how well Philly can develop them in tandem.\"\n\nEdgecombe stepped right into a starting spot for the Sixers this season, and he’s been impressive. In 21 appearances, he’s averaging 14.7 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.3 steals per performance.\n\nWhile the raw numbers aren’t staggering, Edgecombe has shown the Sixers everything that they could have hoped to see from him at this early point in his career. He’s an elite athlete who can get to the rim almost at will and finish once there. He’s also shown an ability to space the floor, as he’s shooting 38 percent from long range and nearly 44 percent on catch-and-shoot opportunities from distance.\n\nBut, he’s been perhaps even more impressive on the defensive end where he’s shown the potential to be an elite perimeter defender. Last month, Sixers coach Nick Nurse even referred to Edgecombe as one of the best defenders on the team. He truly has All-Defensive team talent and potential.\n\nAs we've seen with the likes of Ben Simmons, being named as one of the best players under 25 isn't a guarantee that a player's potential will be realized, but it's high praise nonetheless, especially for a rookie.",

    "fullText": "Brandon Royval vs. Manel Kape squared off in a Flyweight bout earlier tonight (Sat., Dec. 13, 2025) at UFC Vegas 112 inside UFC Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nKape opened the fight with some chopping low kicks, pressing Royval backwards. Royval ripped a nice body kic but absorbed a counter right hand in response. Royval was active with his kicks but didn’t commit his weight to all of them. Kape flurried forward with a couple nice body punches. Royval blasted another kick, but Kape backed him into the fence and unloaded with a vicious right hook.\n\nRoyval hit the floor in a heap! Royval tried to pop back up but found himself under a hail of fast power punches. Royval went out cold at least once and then woke back up as the referee moved to intervene. “Raw Dog” protested, but this was a clean KO from “Starboy.”\n\nIs this Kape finally living up to his potential? He just blitzed the No. 2-ranked Flyweight in the world and made it look pretty easy. Now riding a three-fight finish streak, there’s chance we see Kape vs. Joshua Van sometime in the next few months. Between the recent victories of Kape, Kyoji Horiguchi, and Tatsuro Taira, Flyweight has really heated up!\n\nResult: Manel Kape defeats Brandon Royval via first-round knockout",

    "description": "The final UFC fight of 2025, and on ESPN, was a short one.",
    "fullText": "The final UFC fight of 2025, and on ESPN, was a short one. In a battle of flyweight contenders, Manel Kape made short work of Brandon Royval with a first-round knockout Saturday at UFC Vegas 112, earning his eighth win in his past nine fights.\n\nWith such a one-sided win over a one-time title challenger, Kape made his case for a title shot against new UFC flyweight champion Joshua Van, though he might have to get in line.\n\nThe fight was fairly even for the first couple of minutes, but it ended almost immediately after Kape landed a right hook that left Royval falling to the mat. A few more strikes and referee Herb Dean had seen enough at the 3:18 mark of the opening round, even though Royval wasn't happy with the stoppage.\n\nThe last UFC fight of 2025 was ended in style by @ManelKape 😲 #UFCVegas112pic.twitter.com/uwtIhwQ8EZ\n\n— Uncrowned (@uncrownedcombat) December 14, 2025\n\nKape had a rude welcome to the UFC in 2021, suffering back-to-back losses to Alexandre Pantoja (a tough first assignment in retrospect) and Matheus Nicolau. Since then, he has been on a tear, earning three straight wins by finish since his last loss to Muhammad Mokaev. He was supposed to face Royval in June, but had to withdraw due to a broken foot.\n\nVan took that spot and used it as a launching pad to his successful title shot against Pantoja, won via freak injury at UFC 323.\n\nKape took the opportunity Saturday to call out the Houston-based champ. It was one of the more colorful callouts you will ever hear:\n\n\"Joshua Van, you have my belt. If I hadn't broke my feet in July, I would be the champion right now. Now baby, listen very well. I'm here, your daddy. Your daddy is going to take your diapers, alive, on the new deal, Paramount deal. I'm going to take your diapers, alive.\n\n\"Be ready, because you are in Houston, right? Let's fight in Houston in February, or whatever you want. Just sign the contract. Houston is my city.\"\n\nKape's win doesn't make the UFC's path forward at flyweight any simpler. Tatsuro Taira was quickly presented as a natural option for Van following his own win over Brandon Moreno at UFC 323, and Pantoja had the kind of run atop the division that warrants an immediate rematch as soon as he's healthy. But Kape sure looks like a guy who can challenge for the belt soon.\n\nCheck out full UFC Vegas 112 results and highlights below.\n\nFlyweight: Manel Kape def.

    "fullText": "It was Dave Shondell's three-word reply on social media that became the rallying cry for Purdue volleyball.\n\n\"We not dead,\" Shondell posted March 28, a response to an account that claimed NIL had killed the Boilermaker volleyball program.\n\nPurdue then spent 34 matches during the 2025 season backing up their coach's belief.\n\nIt concluded Saturday night in Fitzgerald Field House against top-seeded and regional host Pitt, a 25-22, 25-21, 22-25, 25-17 winner, in the Elite Eight, the Panthers' fifth straight Final Four appearance.\n\nBefore it ended, though, the Boilermakers made one thing perfectly clear: Purdue volleyball did not die.\n\nAfter losing 92.5% of its offense from a season ago, including four potential starting players who transferred elsewhere, Purdue rebuilt its roster through the portal and with returnees stepping into larger roles.\n\nThe Boilermakers went 27-7, reaching their first regional final since 2021.\n\n\"I will never forget this year,\" junior outside hitter Kenna Wollard, a first-team All-Big Ten selection and Midwest Region Player of the Year, said. \"Everything we've gone through and everything we've accomplished has just been absolutely amazing.\n\n\"The girls that I played with this year were so, so special to me.\"\n\nOn Wollard: Elite 8 run inspires Purdue volleyball coach to sign new contract\n\nPurdue will lose four players from its roster: Rachel Williams, Julia Kane, Lindsey Miller and Akasha Anderson, the latter two transfers who played just one season with the Boilermakers.\n\nShondell opened his post-match news conference following the team's season-ending loss with a cautionary tale of current-age college athletics in its era of name, image and likeness, revenue sharing and mass transfers.\n\n\"It was a meaningful season for Purdue and a meaningful season, as I told our team, for college athletics,\" Shondell said. \"First of all, college athletics has changed. It's not going to go backwards ... I think teams and programs and administrations just have to recognize that when people do decide to leave, you wish them well and you go find more players.\n\n\"If your program truly is a positive program that develops athletes and provides great experiences, players will come into your program and you'll be able to continue. I think that's what we were able to do at Purdue.\"\n\n1 on 1: Dave Shondell was ready to retire, how 'ever grateful' Purdue reenergized him\n\nPurdue welcomed in five new faces via the portal: Anderson (Michigan State), Miller (USC), Bianka Lulić (Miami), Dior Charles (Wake Forest) and Nataly Moravec (Iowa). Purdue tied a program record with five All-Big Ten selections, which included All-Midwest Region honorees Grace Heaney, Taylor Anderson and Ryan McAleer, all returnees.\n\nAn offseason was spent as much on relationship building as much as skill development.\n\nPurdue's volleyball program didn't die. It got better.\n\n\"When I got there in the spring, it felt like people just were a little broken, emotionally and mentally, and I feel like the entire team just used the entire spring, in the summer, in the fall, to just completely love each other with open arms,\" Akasha Anderson said. \"I think that's just been shown on every single game that we've won, every single game that we've lost, this team just loves each other.\n\n\"If they keep that up, that's just going to take them so far.\"\n\nNathan Baird and Sam King have the best Purdue sports coverage, and \n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Purdue volleyball proves it can win in NIL era of college athletics",

    "fullText": "Manchester City travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace in what promises to be an entertaining Premier League affair later this afternoon.\n\nThe Cityzens will be out for vengeance after falling to the Eagles in the 2024/25 FA Cup final, but Palace have proven they’re no pushovers this season.\n\nNevertheless, City head into the game in remarkable form, having won four consecutive games in all competitions, most recently claiming a 2-1 Champions League win against familiar foes Real Madrid.\n\nLos Blancos got off to a fine start when Rodrygo broke the deadlock just before the half-hour mark, but goals from Nico O’Reilly and Erling Braut Haaland helped City turn the game on its head.\n\nBefore that fixture, City had seen off Leeds United, Fulham, and Sunderland to keep pace with Arsenal at the Premier League summit.\n\nThe Gunners extended their lead with a 2-1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, so it’s up to City to respond, but it may not be straightforward.\n\nCity have a dominant record against Palace. They’ve won four of their last seven league meetings with the Eagles (D3), but the FA Cup final is proof that Palace have what it takes to halt their momentum.\n\nThe last time Pep Guardiola made sweeping changes to his starting line-up, City paid the price with a 2-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nSince then, the Spaniard has made it a habit of keeping the core of the squad intact, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he makes just one change to his starting XI against Palace.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma is guaranteed to retain his place in goal ahead of out-of-favour James Trafford, while a back four of O’Reilly, Josko Gvardiol, Ruben Dias, and Mathues Nunes should also remain intact.\n\nThe minor tweak expected should come in midfield, although Nico Gonzalez is expected to keep his place while Rodri continues his recovery.\n\nTijjani Reijnders should come in for Bernardo Silva, who wasn’t at his best against Madrid.\n\nThe 31-year-old’s 6/10 performance might be a sign of fatigue, so Reijnders, who has notched seven goal contributions (two goals and five assists), could get a chance.\n\nThe Dutchman will likely be joined by Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki, and Phil Foden, while Haaland leads the line.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City will enter today’s pivotal Premier League fixture against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park off the back of four consecutive victories in all competitions. Pep Guardiola’s side scraped their way to wins over Leeds United and Fulham. They put in arguably their best performance of the season to beat Sunderland 3-nil last weekend at the Etihad. They followed that win with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. It is clear that this City side is beginning to build real momentum ahead of a critical stage of the 25/26 season. They’ll face a tough test against a well-organised Crystal Palace side to continue the momentum they have built.\n\nWe are now seeing that Pep Guardiola’s side is developing the tough edge that previous Manchester City sides have been renowned for. City scrapped and fought their way to a crucial win against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu and that win should fill this City side with confidence and self-belief. The win over Real Madrid was Manchester City’s fourth consecutive win in all competitions and the manner of City’s win in Madrid showed that this City side is in a good position ahead of a critical stage of the 25/26 season.\n\nIn an interview with mancity.com, Ruben Dias has shared his belief that this new-look City team is in a good position. But they must continue to progress and grow if they wish to continue their momentum and challenge for honours at the end of this season. He explained: “We all have to work out how we can be as profitable as possible for the team. For the team. And in that sense, I think that as one of the captains, as one of the team leaders, you have and we have this mission to make it very clear what the essentials are – the things our team can’t live without.”\n\n“And I think we’re getting better and better at that. In that sense, everyone feels and knows exactly how they can best contribute to the team. I feel like we’re in a good place, but I still feel we have a lot of progress to make.”\n\nPep Guardiola’s side will face a tough test against Crystal Palace today if they wish to continue their recent momentum and continue the process of growing as a team. Oliver Glasner’s side is tough to beat at Selhurst Park and they are a team that is well-organised defensively and is also packed with quality all over the pitch. Defensively, Palace have the second-best defence in the Premier League. They have only conceded 12 goals in 15 Premier League matches and their defensive solidity forms the foundation of their play. Marc Guehi and Maxine Lacroix form the backbone of their defence. Dean Henderson is a proven Premier League goalkeeper who helps give Palace a strong defensive foundation.\n\nBut Crystal Palace are more than just a solid defensive outfit. With Jean-Philippe Mateta, Adam Wharton, Daniel Munoz, Yéremy Pino and Eddie Nketiah in their lineup, they do pack a punch in the final third. Oliver Glasner’s squad is well-constructed and they will pose a tough challenge for Manchester City to overcome today.\n\nManchester City have built real momentum in recent matches. They are also growing as a team and the scope for them to grow even further is clear to see. They’ll face a tough test against a quality opponent today in Crystal Palace. Oliver Glasner’s side has the talent to provide a stern test for Pep Guardiola’s side. If City can overcome Palace at Selhurst Park it could be a result that could see them progress as a team as Ruben Dias has demanded.",

    "fullText": "It was just one of those nights for the Washington Capitals (18-10-4). They put up one of their weaker performances and got crushed 5-1 by the Winnipeg Jets (15-15-1) on Saturday.\n\nFrom the get-go, the Capitals just couldn’t get much going, as they only totaled three shots in the first period.\n\nThe Capitals’ performance was so bad to the point where they trailed 5-0 in the third period. It took a 5-on-3 opportunity for the team to end the shutout, thanks to Jakob Chychrun.\n\nIt also didn’t help that defending Hart Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck made his return for Winnipeg after his injury.\n\nLogan Thompson did all he could as he stopped 30 of 35 shots, but wasn’t given much help from his teammates.\n\nWith this result, the Capitals’ nine-game point streak comes to an end. They will look to regroup as they visit the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday.\n\nComing off the previous game, it seemed like the Capitals’ offense had been sputtering. Saturday’s loss against Winnipeg wasn’t any better.\n\nThe Capitals got off to another slow start, as they were outshot by Winnipeg 13-3 and trailed 2-0 in the opening period.\n\nDefending Hart Trophy winner Hellebuyck made his return for Winnipeg after missing time due to knee surgery. He was too much for the Capitals as he stopped 24 of 25 shots.\n\nThe Capitals struggled on the 5-on-5 throughout the night, failing to generate much pressure or enter the zone cleanly. Carbery changed up the lines, with Brandon Duhaime and Nic Dowd reuniting, and Hendrix Lapierre moving up to 3C. Unfortunately, the new lines didn’t work.\n\nMultiple Capitals players finished below zero when it came to the plus-minus. However, Justin Sourdif registered the worst at -3.\n\nThe Capitals also struggled on special teams, failing to convert on their first three power-play opportunities. The team also gave up a Winnipeg goal on the penalty kill in the middle frame.\n\nThe Capitals finally got on the board late when Chychrun fired the puck past Hellebuyck on the 5-on-3.\n\nChychrun now has 12 goals on the season, while Alex Ovechkin’s assist moved him past Jaromir Jagr for 10th-most power-play points in NHL history.\n\nThis just wasn’t one of the better performances for the Capitals. The team couldn’t generate chances and was outplayed by Winnipeg.\n\nWhile the Capitals weren’t able to get going on the 5-on-5, the special teams didn’t help for the most part. The Capitals finally scored via Chychrun on the two-man advantage late in the game.\n\nThompson was put in a rough situation as he made 30 saves on the night. Though the five goals he gave up made all the difference (not his fault).\n\nThe 23-year-old made his NHL debut and was quite all right. Playing on the fourth line with Duhaime and Dowd, Trineyev tried to be physical and finished with 11:45 of ice time.\n\nJohn Cena Officially Retires: 6 Dream Matches We Never Got, Including Versus Goldberg\n\nSaturday Night’s Main Event Results: Highlights From John Cena Retirement Match & Grades\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden",

    "fullText": "PEORIA — Jean-Guy Trudel spelled out a clear message to his Peoria Rivermen team Saturday, and he didn't need any letters to do it.\n\nThe four-time SPHL Coach of the Year stripped the leadership letters off his players' jerseys before a rematch against Knoxville.\n\nThe Rivermen responded with a 5-0 victory that gave them a split in the weekend series before 3,989 who braved a winter storm to watch inside Carver Arena.\n\nThe Rivermen did it, technically, without a captain or two assistants.\n\nTrudel's decision to remove the \"C\" from veteran captain Alec Baer's jersey and the \"A\" off Garrett Devine's and Josh Martin's jerseys came overnight, after the Rivermen lost to Knoxville on Friday and slipped into sixth place. But it was something Trudel had been thinking about all week as he assessed his team amid four losses in six outings.\n\n\"Leadership has to be above and beyond, it has to be special,\" Trudel said. \"If you don't lead, you don't stay with the Peoria Rivermen. This is who we are, it's how we win, it's our culture to play fast, play heavy and play like this team means everything in the world to us.\n\n\"Leaders have to earn it every day. We're going to wait before we put any letters back on any uniforms. We're going to see who responds. We're going to see who steps up. It's a simple message: The Rivermen Way, or the highway.\"\n\nDevine responded with a two-goal, +4 game in which he imposed his will on the Ice Bears with a high-motor outing from start to finish.\n\nRivermen linemate and newcomer Khaden Henry? He merely notched a hat trick in his second game with the team, one of them a spectacular skill display. He produced 3 goals on 13 shots and a +4 rating in two games.\n\n\"We didn't really have any choice but to receive Jean-Guy Trudel's message,\" Devine said. \"It was a big game for us. A big inflection point. Early in a year you can reach a point where your season goes one of two ways, and I'm really proud of the way the guys responded and did a lot of the right things. The letter stuff is what it is. Guys know who the leaders are and it's everyone's job to lead.\n\n\"Everyone stepped up and played as a team effort, on the ice, off the ice, locker room, bench, everywhere. It's a matter of doing this every single night, every single guy.\n\n\"That's the biggest thing with our team, the way we're composed right now. Every single guy has to bring it, every single guy has to be a leader, every single guy has to do everything.\"\n\nThis story will be updated with more interviews and information.\n\nDave Eminian is the Journal Star sports columnist, and covers Bradley men's basketball, the Rivermen and Chiefs.

    "fullText": "Manel Kape closed out the last UFC fight of the ESPN era last night (Sat., Dec. 13, 2025) at UFC Vegas 112 LIVE on ESPN+ from inside UFC Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada, putting a vicious stop to flyweight contender Brandon Royval with a first-round TKO (punches).\n\nRoyval is as durable as they come, but some feared he’d get caught too often in a striking battle with Kape. It was paramount for Royval to be able to utilize his grappling, wild transitions, and submission threats to drag this fight into deep water. If “Raw Dawg” couldn’t keep Kape guessing it was going to be a long night.\n\nUnfortunately for Royval, Kape was dialed in from the opening bell and he was dictating the action all the way through. Kape eventually forced his way inside along the cage and landed a huge right hand that sent Royval crumbling to the ground. In less than a second Kape was on “Raw Dawg” again for another clean right followed by a few more shots. There was no doubt that Royval was out as the referee slid in for the stoppage, even though he quickly got back to his feet (albeit stumbling).\n\nIt was a great way to close out 2025 and a perfect knockout finish to end the ESPN era.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder saw its 16-game winning streak end in Saturday night’s 111-109 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe Thunder held a 49-46 lead at halftime, but were unable to hold off the Spurs, who had four players score 20 points or more.\n\n“When you play close games, you’re not going to win them all,” Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault said. “I thought we put ourselves in a tough position there, playing from behind down the stretch.”\n\nOklahoma City gave up 65 second-half points in Saturday’s loss. The Spurs made 13 3-pointers and had 40 points in the paint.\n\n“Sometimes it comes down to make or miss plays,” Daigneault said. “We made some good passes out of double teams and stuff like that, so I thought our offensive attacks were okay. We didn’t get a ton of stop down at the other end.”\n\nGuard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led Oklahoma City with 29 points on 12/23 shooting. He also added four rebounds and five assists but also had five turnovers. Daigneault said the Spurs did a good job defending Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\n“There was a lot of controllable stuff we can learn from that game that wasn’t where we’d like it to be,” Daigneault said.\n\nThe Thunder struggled from 3-point range, shooting 9/37 (24%) from behind the arc.\n\n“It wasn’t our sharpest night,” Daigneault said. “Certainly, our attacks weren’t as sharp as they’ve normally been.”\n\nIt was the first loss for the Thunder since a 121-119 defeat to the Portland Trail Blazers on Nov. 5.",

    "description": "Brandon Svaboda scored the go-ahead goal for Boston University men's ice hockey in the third period of Saturday's game.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON – Before the lights went out at Matthews Arena for the last time, they shined brightly on Boston University center Brandon Svoboda.\n\nThe sophomore from Pittsburgh scored two goals including the game-winner at 18:21 of the third to lift the Terriers to a 4-3 victory over Northeastern, on Saturday night. Svoboda’s fourth of the season was the final goal scored at Northeastern’s historic Matthews Arena.\n\nThe Terriers’ victory over the Huskies was the last sporting event played inside Matthews Arena, which officially opened its doors as Boston Arena in April of 1910.\n\n“I got a lucky bounce and I capitalized on it and put it in the back of the net,” said Svoboda. “Playing the last game ever in this building is pretty special and what was it, 1910 this place was built so it was pretty special being the last team playing in this building.\n\n“We are a young group and we are figuring it out so it was obviously a big deal to get a W in the last game in this arena.”\n\nBU improved to 9-8-1 and 6-3-0 in Hockey East going into the semester break while the No. 11 Huskies fell to 10-6-0 and 5-4-0 in the conference.\n\n“It was just a big win for us going into the semester break,” said BU coach Jay Pandolfo. “The first half has not been ideal for us so to finish it that way, to come back in the third period to win a hockey game in this environment, where this is their last home game here and they wanted to win and we found a way to pull it off.”\n\nNortheastern purchased the structure in 1979 and renamed it Matthews Arena three years later. The demolition of the old barn nestled between Mass. Ave and Gainsborough Street will begin in January and the new arena is scheduled to go online in September of 2028.\n\n“Having a new facility is definitely a big selling point,” said NU coach Jerry Keefe. “It is going to have all the amenities you need to develop players and I think this generation of recruits like the shiny and the new.”\n\nThe first Beanpot Tournament was played at Boston Arena in 1952, so it seemed appropriate that Northeastern would play its final game against a neighboring Beanpot opponent. BU played its home games at Boston Arena from 1918 to 1971 before moving into its new facility on Babcock Street.\n\nPandolfo enjoyed many Matthews moments both on the ice and behind the bench. Pandolfo also played in the final Beanpot game at the old Boston Garden.\n\n“I always enjoyed playing here that’s for sure,” Pandolfo said. “It was a fun place to play and I always enjoyed it and I enjoyed coaching there. It is a great environment and a special old building.\n\n“That’s the biggest attachment for me and that I just enjoyed it. My grandfather played at Northeastern, my mom’s dad and that makes it special as well. It was also Boston University’s home rink as well for a long time and that is a big reason we are here closing it out with Northeastern.”\n\nThe Huskies had some extra zip in their blades that created several scoring opportunities, all of which deftly handled by BU netminder Mikhail Yegorov.\n\nNU went up 1-0 on a power play goal by freshman center Jacob Mathieu at 11:28 of the first. Mathieu found an opening outside the BU crease and redirected Giacomo Martino’s wrister from the left circle for his fifth of the season.\n\nNU went up 2-0 at 14:36 when junior center Tyler Fukakusa finished a two-on-one break with his second goal of the season. BU got on the board when Svoboda netted a power play goal at 17:40, his third of the season.\n\n“We were playing fine but we just made some mistakes so to get out of that first period 2-1 was important no question about that,” said Pandolfo.\n\nBU tied the game 2-2 on sophomore center Sacha Boisvert’s second of the season at 13:38 of the second. NU went up 3-2 when sophomore left wing Joe Connor beat the buzzer at 19:59 with his sixth of the season. NU tied the game 3-3 on Kamil Bednarik tally at 18:02 of the third. Svoboda would score 19 seconds later to complete the comeback.\n\n“You give up a late goal at the end of the second period after a power play, that can really hurt you,” said Pandolfo. “But our guys were determined to come back.”",

    "fullText": "Head coach Brendon McCullum said England are unlikely to make changes to their batting line-up for the crucial third Ashes Test in Adelaide, which begins on Wednesday.\n\nEngland, 2-0 down after the first two Tests, must beat Australia at the Adelaide Oval to keep their hopes of regaining the Ashes alive.\n\nNumber three Ollie Pope and wicketkeeper Jamie Smith may have been candidates to be left out if England had considered making changes.\n\nBut asked if he anticipated fielding the usual top seven, McCullum said: \"I would have thought so.\n\n\"We've been in positions where we have made some mistakes, and that can happen at times. But for us to go on and win this series, it's not about throwing out what has been successful for us over the last few years. It's about having more conviction.\n\n\"Knee-jerk reactions and chopping and changing settled batting line-ups is not really our way.\"\n\nIt is unusual for McCullum to address the media before a Test, and he explained his appearance on Sunday was because \"we know where we are in the series\".\n\nIn wide-ranging comments, McCullum:\n\nleft the door open for spinner Shoaib Bashir and seamer Josh Tongue to play in Adelaide\n\nsaid any speculation that his job would be on the line if England lose this week \"does not really bother me\"\n\nexplained his previous comments about England being \"overprepared\" for their second-Test defeat in Brisbane\n\nrejected any suggestion his team go about things in a \"casual manner\".\n\nWith changes to the top seven now seemingly off the table, England could opt to refresh their bowling line-up.\n\nConditions in Adelaide, including the high temperatures forecast when the Test begins on Wednesday (23:30 GMT on Tuesday), could necessitate the inclusion of specialist spinner Bashir.\n\n'Noosa, Noosa, Noosa' - England's Ashes break ends\n\nEngland security guard accused of 'confrontation'\n\nAll-rounder Will Jacks was chosen ahead of Bashir in Brisbane, though captain Ben Stokes insisted Bashir remains England's first-choice spinner.\n\nThe 22-year-old was earmarked for this trip more than a year ago, but has not played a Test since July because of a broken finger and has figures of 2-266 from his two tour games in Australia.\n\nTongue would be the most likely candidate to come in if England want a new paceman, with Gus Atkinson possibly making way.\n\n\"We need to have a look at the conditions,\" McCullum told BBC Sport. \"We have a squad of 16 here, which in a five-Test series, we know we will have to call upon the majority if not all of those.\n\n\"We will work out what we think is the best option to be successful in these conditions.\"\n\nHeavy defeats on Ashes tours have often brought changes to England regimes.\n\nThis series was billed as a huge opportunity for England to win back the urn, yet the tourists are at risk of being out of the series at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nThough McCullum and Stokes are contracted to England until the end of the next home Ashes in 2027, their positions - along with that of director of cricket Rob Key - will come in for intense scrutiny if England are beaten in Adelaide.\n\nAsked if a loss would put his job under pressure, McCullum said: \"I don't know, but it doesn't really bother me, to be honest.\n\n\"I certainly don't coach to protect the job. I coach to get the best out of people and that's the same with the skipper. We both go about that in our same way with the same level of conviction and that won't be changing this week just because the prize is at its highest.\n\n\"I firmly believe that if we play our best cricket, we are a massive chance in this Test match. If we do that, then the narrative changes and the series momentum changes.\"\n\nHow much do you know about past Ashes games in Adelaide?\n\nIn the run-up to the second Test, England chose not to send players from the first Test to join a day-night England Lions game against a Prime Minister's XI in Canberra.\n\nThe tourists instead opted for five days of training in Brisbane which, in the aftermath of the Gabba defeat, McCullum claimed left them \"overprepared\".\n\nOn Sunday, the former New Zealand captain said he stood by his comments, but also explained he made them to draw attention away from the players.\n\n\"There's things that you say and things that you do - in the job you're in, sometimes it's better for the scrutiny to be on yourself,\" said McCullum.\n\n\"There is no perfect preparation. If there was and you could hit 4,000 balls to guarantee an average of 90, or bowl however many balls to guarantee 10 wickets, then we'll do it - don't worry. But that doesn't exist.\n\n\"Five intense days leading up to a Test match is not the best way to prepare. We'll be working out these next three days to make sure we get ourselves in the right frame of mind and skill level to be able to perform.\"\n\nEngland returned to training on Sunday following a break in the Queensland resort town of Noosa.\n\nTheir approach has often attracted criticism, in particular their off-field activities during this tour.\n\nOn Sunday they began their training session with intense fielding drills, which have been uncommon for England under Stokes and McCullum.\n\n\"I do feel like there's a feeling that we go about our work in a very casual manner, but it couldn't be further from the truth,\" added McCullum.\n\n\"The level of intensity with which we try to operate with and the hard edge we try to bring to the team, is all encompassing. It's how we try to live our lives and set about this cricket team.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Belfast-based Sumo Na hÉireann is Ireland's first sumo club, capitalising on the sports growing popularity.",
    "fullText": "It's a scene you would expect to see in Tokyo.\n\nBut the sound of bare feet padding, and bodies thudding on the mat of a sports hall in Belfast signals an unlikely first - the ancient Japanese tradition of sumo wrestling has landed in Northern Ireland.\n\nSumo Na hÉireann is thought to be the first sumo wrestling club on the island of Ireland and its members are keen to make their mark.\n\nAmong them is Toraigh Mallon, who believes she is Ireland's first female sumo wrestler.\n\nShe says sumo is \"definitely on the up,\" with \"new members coming along every week\".\n\nSumo Na hÉireann club founder Johnny Templeton said the growing interest comes hot on the heels of the professional Grand Sumo Tournament in London's Royal Albert Hall in October.\n\nUnlike professional sumo in Japan, where women are not allowed to compete, amateur sumo does have female competitions.\n\nMs Mallon is determined to break through to the top, and is training hard in preparation for the inaugural British Isles Sumo Wrestling Championship at Ulster University in January, where she expects a \"grudge match\" against her Norwegian counterpart.\n\nShe was drawn into the world of sumo by an advert on Instagram and has not looked back since.\n\n\"I would do anything to get out of the house, because I don't like sitting in, I like being active.\"\n\nFor Toraigh, it's training every night of the week, be that in the gym, boxing and in the dohyō (sumo ring) in preparation for her match in January.\n\nShe said she sees sumo wrestling taking off in Ireland.\n\n\"There's new people here every night, there's a new club in Dublin, it's on the up definitely,\" she added.\n\nIn the amateur games, size and weight doesn't matter just as much as it does in the professional world.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Mr Templeton said: \"In amateur competitions, which we compete in, there is weight classes, so you'll never have to fight someone outside of your weight class, unless you want to.\"\n\n\"The professionals you see on TV, there's no weight classes so they can get as big as they like,\" he said.\n\nMr Templeton said Sumo Na hÉireann came to be after he competed for Team GB in the world championships and in amateur competitions across the UK.\n\nHe got into sumo after competing in other types of martial arts and wrestling for most of his life and after having sumo success in the UK, that's when he decided to carry sumo over to Ireland.\n\nSumo Na hÉireann is just over a year old, and expanded to Dublin last month.\n\nMr Templeton believes sumo wrestling has found a home here in Ireland, and thinks sumo has some interesting similarities to an old Irish form of wrestling.\n\n\"The way sumo is the native, indigenous traditional wrestling of Japan, Ireland does have that as well, it's just that it's practice has been lost over the years.\"\n\nTraditional Irish wrestling is called collar-and-elbow wrestling.\n\n\"It is focused mostly on foot sweeps, and is a type of jacketed wrestling but the goal is very much the same as it is in sumo.\n\n\"The parallels are amazing,\" he added.\n\nRising sumo star Matt Wilson has been competing in the UK and has his eye on the world championships next year.\n\nSumo is his passion, and he said aside from the weekly bouts, he trains hard in the gym and keeps an eye on his diet.\n\n\"I used to eat loads to get my weight up so I could wrestle some of the heavier guys,\" he said.\n\nNow he keeps a \"maintenance weight\" so he is able to fight faster and still stay heavy.\n\nMr Wilson said he \"can definitely see sumo exploding\" in the UK and Ireland especially after the Grand Sumo Tournament in London.\n\nFrom leg stomps to drive away evil spirits, to throwing salt to purify the ring (or dohyō), and burying food as an offering, sumo wrestling is steeped in traditions and sumo wrestlers (or Rikishi), live highly-regimented lives.\n\nMost sumo wrestlers in Japan are required to live in communal sumo training stables, where every aspect of their daily lives - from diet to dress code - are dictated by traditions.\n\nYet while the ancient Japanese customs are acknowledged and respected at Sumo Na hÉireann, the focus is on the wrestling, and everyone is welcome.\n\nThe basic principle of sumo is that a match is decided by a fighter either being forced out of the circular dohyō (ring), or touching the ground inside the ring with any part of the body other than the soles of the feet.\n\nRitual, wrestling and Reddit: Grand Sumo meets internet fandom in London",

    "description": "Manel Kape wants a fight against new flyweight champion Joshua Van in 2026",
    "fullText": "Manel Kape made quite a statement that a title fight should be next after he flattened Brandon Royval with a devastating knockout in the first round in the main event at UFC Vegas 112.\n\nIt was a stunning performance from Kape, who showed no fear taking on a known finisher like Royval. After a few exchanges on the feet, Kape finally saw his opening to jump into a combination and it was a short right hand that blasted Royval and sent him crashing to the canvas.\n\nKape followed up with a few more punches and Royval was knocked unconscious momentarily until the next shot woke him up again. The referee rushed in to rescue Royval with the end coming at just 3:18 into the opening round.\n\nMANEL KAPE FINISHES BRANDON ROYVAL IN ROUND 1 😲 #UFCVegas113 pic.twitter.com/PpgXiNOmI3\n\n— ESPN MMA (@espnmma) December 14, 2025\n\nWith the win, Kape sent an emphatic message to new UFC flyweight champion Joshua Van after he claimed the belt at UFC 323 following a freak injury suffered by Alexandre Pantoja.\n\n“Now we’re talking,” Kape said looking directly into the camera. “Joshua Van, you thought Brandon Royval would do something. Now you have my belt. If I didn’t break my foot in July, I would be the champion now.\n\n“I’m here. Your daddy’s going to take your diapers. Be ready. Let’s fight in Houston in February. Just sign the contract. Just be ready. Nobody can f*cking deny the belt. I’m the f*cking best.”\n\nIn a battle of strikers, Royval actually set the tone early with a couple of nasty body kicks while Kape was the aggressor moving forward and trying to cut off the cage. Royval kept backing up and that was exactly what Kape wanted as he set up his combinations.\n\nFollowing a couple of exchanges, Kape finally saw the opening he wanted as he surged forward and trapped Royval against the cage as he unloaded a perfectly timed right hand that landed flush. Royval’s head snapped back and he crumbled to the canvas.\n\nKape continued firing shots until Royval went out with the referee jumping in to stop the contest. While Royval was seemingly woken up by one of the final punches landed, he was obviously very wobbly when attempting to get back to his feet after Kape delivered the knockout blow.\n\nAfter the win, Kape admitted he didn’t actually have a strategy that would lead to the finish but the knockout came just the same.\n\n“There is no game plan,” Kape said. “Brandon Royval just has to step into the cage and I will do the rest. This is beautiful violence. Where I touch, you guys die. Where I touch, coma. Where I touch, hospital I’m the most dangerous man in this division. I’m different. Just pay attention. I’m coming for my belt.”\n\nNow the UFC has a decision to make about what comes next for Van, especially if Pantoja is going to be sidelined for some time with the injury he suffered at UFC 323. Kape clearly made quite a statement with his win on Saturday and Tatsuro Taira did the same after he finished former champion Brandon Moreno.\n\nIt’s likely one of those two are going to get the next shot when Van is ready to defend his flyweight title in 2026.",

    "description": "The Bayern loanee's future in Hamburg is unkown",
    "fullText": "Daniel Peretz was surprised earlier this year when he was not named number one for newly promoted Hamburg when he joined them on loan. Instead he has been left on the bench for every league match and only played in three DFB-Pokal matches — including last week’s thriller against Holstein Kiel. He had back to back wins to begin his campaign, before coming up against Kiel. He was able to keep a cleansheet for 118 minutes, but conceded a late equalizer that forced penalty kicks. Peretz saved one penalty, but they ultimately fell 4-2.\n\nAfter the match Peretz was asked if he would terminate the loan in January when the transfer window opens. He told Sport Bild (as reported by @iMiaSanMia) that, “I expected to be number one. That hasn’t been the case so far. Of course, I’m not happy about it. I make no secret of that. I think no footballer is happy when he’s not playing. My goal remains to play every game. I came to HSV to play as many matches as possible. I’m accepting the situation now, taking it one game at a time, training hard, and trying to give my best every day – to make it as difficult as possible for the coaching staff.”\n\nBayern are unlikely to recall Peretz to Munich without a solid plan to loan him out for the rest of the season. The question remains: if no other Bundesliga team is willing to give Peretz playing time, would it be better for him to remain in Hamburg and fight for a spot or go to a lower division where he could have constant playing time? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",

    "fullText": "A Chelsea legend has declared that he wants to become manager of the club one day very soon, but he’s not yet retired.\n\nThe Blues have a lot of legends of course, and I am sure that there is many of them who would love the idea of managing the club one day, but not all of them will manage it.\n\nNot all of them will even go into coaching or become successful doing it, but if any current player can do it to a top standard then I have no doubt that Thiago Silva can. He’s a superbly intelligent player and has the right attitude and mentality to move into coaching, which is what he is planning to do once he retires from the game soon.\n\nSilva is still currently playing back in his native Brazil to see his career out, but he will soon be stepping up into a coaching role, and who would bet against him becoming Chelsea manager one day? Those are his intentions.\n\nThiago Silva claps the Chelsea fans\n\n‘When I become a coach, I’ve set myself a goal: To coach all the teams where I have played,’ Silva told L’Equipe.\n\nIt does seem like something that is destined to happen. When Silva says something, you know he means it and you know he aims to follow through on all his goals. His sons are in the Chelsea academy, imagine he manages them at the club one day soon? Don’t bet against that either.\n\nYou get a sense that Enzo Maresca and the Chelsea board are having a bit of a rift and that the two could part ways sooner rather than later, especially judging off the gaffers latest interview yesterday.\n\nIt came after Chelsea beat Everton 2-0 in what seemed to be a relief feeling for Maresca after Malo Gusto scored the decisive second goal for his side to go away with all three points.\n\nObviously it’s way too soon for Silva to jump in yet, but the way Chelsea go I am sure there will be an opportunity down the line in the not so distant future.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLess than two weeks after their first meeting of the season, the Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns are set to go head-to-head again on Sunday night.\n\nThe Suns won the first meeting between the two teams by a score of 125-108, so the Lakers will be looking for some revenge this time around. Luckily, they’ll have their future Hall-of-Famer available for the game.\n\nLeBron James, who has been dealing with various ailments throughout the season, isn’t listed on the official injury report for the contest, so he should be good to go. On the season, James is averaging 16.5 points, 7.6 assists and 6.0 rebounds per performance in just eight appearances.\n\nBut, while James will be available for L.A. against Phoenix, a few other players won’t be. Austin Reaves, Maxi Kleber and Bronny James have all been ruled out of the game. Reaves, who has been a huge factor in L.A.'s early-season success, is expected to miss a week of action with a calf strain.\n\nMeanwhile, the Suns will be without Jalen Green and Isaiah Livers. Star guard Devin Booker is also listed as questionable for the contest.\n\nHeading into the game, the Lakers are fifth in the Western Conference standings with a 17-7 record while the Suns sit seventh at 14-11. Since they're in the same division, the two teams will play two more times this season after Sunday, including once later this month. They'll also play in late February.",

    "fullText": "A number of players are being touted as potential additions to Liverpool’s front line as the January window fast approaches.\n\nAntoine Semenyo and Yan Diomande are two of the names that are being constantly linked with a move to Merseyside but, whilst both are great players in their own right, neither are on the level of Salah.\n\nVery few players in fact are capable of reaching the level that Salah displayed last season, when the forward scored 34 goals and provided 23 assists for Liverpool.\n\nThe man who looks closest to that level currently in Europe is long-term Reds’ target Michael Olise.\n\nThe Frenchman has six goals and nine assists in just 13 appearances for Bayern Munich this season, but a reported price tag of €150 million (~£131m) complicates things.\n\nThat fee would exceed the club-record £125m Liverpool paid for Alexander Isak in the summer, a window in which the Reds broke their club record twice after bringing in Florian Wirtz a few weeks before Isak’s arrival.\n\nThe bar has been set high by Salah at Liverpool. Isak and Wirtz may be capable of picking up some of the responsibility in the Reds’ front line without Salah, but the addition of Olise would take Arne Slot’s side to a whole new level.\n\nOver the past year, the Frenchman ranks in the top percentile among Europe’s wingers for both assists and shot creating actions.\n\nThe 24-year-old plays 6.74 progressive passes per 90 minutes, has 5.18 progressive carries per 90 and completes 2.5 successful take-ons per 90.\n\nOn top of that he also takes 3.61 shots per 90 and averages 6.5 touches in the opposition penalty area.\n\nOlise would not only unlock Liverpool’s current forwards, he provides plenty of goal threat himself.\n\nHaving spent three seasons at Crystal Palace, Olise boasts Premier League experience and wouldn’t need to take time to adjust to English football like Wirtz has this season.\n\nIf that output were to continue if Olise made a Premier League return, he would look well worth the hefty price tag.\n\nThe Reds broke the bank last summer and so far it hasn’t yielded the results many were hoping for.\n\nLiverpool’s chances of retaining the Premier League title looked almost non-existent by the start of December and throwing more money at the situation is an approach many supporters will be cautious off.\n\nManchester United and Chelsea have proven over the last five years that splashing big money on players to add to an already struggling side does not always lead to success.\n\nA record-breaking deal for Olise represents a huge risk, but it could have a huge pay-off.\n\nSlot’s biggest problem this season has been chance creation. Isak and Hugo Ekitike are both known to be ruthless in front of goal, but a lack of consistent high-quality chances has meant they are perceived to be underperforming.\n\nOlise could be the man to finally get Liverpool’s forwards firing and his addition, although expensive, could be the catalyst that makes the Reds title challengers once again.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur are looking to preserve their unbeaten start to December when they take on Nottingham Forest at City Ground later today.\n\nThe mood in the Tottenham dressing room has shifted over the past couple of weeks, with December offering Thomas Frank’s side a renewed sense of belief.\n\nTottenham visit City Ground looking for a third consecutive win in all competitions and a fourth game without defeat (W2, D1).\n\nSpurs ended last month with three consecutive defeats in all competitions.\n\nHowever, they seem to have turned a corner after following up a 2-2 draw at Newcastle United with back-to-back wins over Brentford and Slavia Prague.\n\nThe 2-0 win against Brentford lifted Tottenham closer to the European places.\n\nThey’ll head into the game against Forest six points off fourth-placed Chelsea, and a win over the Tricky Trees will keep them within touching distance.\n\nTottenham’s recent form will take the sting off the fact that they started the weekend in the bottom half of the Premier League table.\n\nHowever, their away form is cause for concern as they take on a resurgent Forest side.\n\nTottenham have lost three of their last four games (D1) away from home, but at least they’ve scored at least twice in six of their seven trips this season.\n\nAfter watching his side put in a performance of complete domination in midweek, Frank will be forgiven for making only a couple of tweaks for the battle with Forest at City Ground.\n\nThe Danish manager will be wary of compromising his chances of putting together three consecutive wins for the first time since joining Spurs.\n\nThat should see Guglielmo Vicario retain his spot in goal as well as a familiar backline of Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, and Djed Spence.\n\nThe “very talented” Archie Gray is in line to start back-to-back Premier League games and a third in a row in all competitions after forcing his way into Frank’s plans.\n\nHe’ll likely be joined by Rodrigo Bentancur, who returns to the XI after sitting out the midweek game.\n\nRandal Kolo Muani should also return to the XI in place of Wilson Odobert, while Xavi Simons, Mohammed Kudus, and Richarlison reprise their roles.",

    "description": "Scientists are testing whether GLP-1 drugs can help to cut cravings for cigarettes, alcohol and opioids — as well as food.",
    "fullText": "Last April, neuroscientist Sue Grigson received an e-mail from a man detailing his years-long struggle to kick addiction — first to opioids, and then to the very medication meant to help him quit.\n\nThe man had stumbled on research by Grigson, suggesting that certain anti-obesity medications could help to reduce rats’ addiction to drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. He decided to try quitting again, this time while taking semaglutide, the blockbuster GLP-1 drug better known as Ozempic. “That’s when he wrote to me,” says Grigson, who works at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey. “He said that he was drug- and alcohol-free for the first time in his adult life.”\n\nStories like this have been spreading fast in the past few years, through online forums, weight-loss clinics and news headlines. They describe people taking diabetes and weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (also marketed as Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound) who find themselves suddenly able to shake long-standing addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. And now, clinical data are starting to back them up.\n\nEarlier this year, a team led by Christian Hendershot, a psychologist now at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, reported in a landmark randomized trial that weekly injections of semaglutide cut alcohol consumption1 — a key demonstration that GLP-1 drugs can alter addictive behaviour in people with a substance-use disorder. More than a dozen randomized clinical studies testing GLP-1 drugs for addiction are now under way worldwide, with some results expected in the next few months.\n\nNeuroscientists, meanwhile, are working out how the weight-loss drugs suppress addiction by acting on hormone receptors in brain regions that control craving, reward and motivation. They are finding that GLP-1 therapies help to blunt urges for alcohol, opioids, nicotine and cocaine through some of the same brain pathways that also quell hunger cues and overeating. “At the end of the day, the neurobiological system that is activated by rewarding substances — food, sex, drugs, rock and roll — it’s the same system,” says Roger McIntyre, a psychopharmacologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. And some researchers are testing whether, by influencing reward-related brain circuits, the drugs might help with dementia and depression as well.\n\nThe research is still in its early stages, scientists warn. “We first need to find out if it’s efficacious and safe,” says W. Kyle Simmons, a neuroimaging specialist at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, who is leading a GLP-1 trial for alcohol reduction.\n\nBut some researchers and physicians are excited. No truly new class of addiction medicine has won approval from regulators in decades, says Elisabet Jerlhag Holm, an addiction biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If GLP-1 drugs prove effective in bigger trials, she says, “it’s a revolution”.\n\nIt took some years for the current buzz around GLP-1 drugs in addiction medicine to build. Researchers originally developed them to control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes by mimicking the hormone GLP-1. Soon it became clear that the drugs could curb appetite and promote weight loss, too. They act on hormone receptors located in the pancreas and gut — where they help to regulate blood sugar and signal fullness — but also in key regions of the brain that control reward and motivation, dialling down the urge for tasty, calorie-laden food.\n\nYet her findings barely registered among addiction researchers, she says, and pharmaceutical companies showed no interest either. “I was quite alone for a long time,” says Jerlhag Holm.\n\nBut Lorenzo Leggio, a physician-scientist at the US National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, noticed the work. He had also been following clues that GLP-1 might influence addictive behaviour and, in 2015, joined forces with Jerlhag Holm to uncover the first evidence of a connection between the hormone and alcohol dependence in humans. The team found that a common variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene was linked to heavier drinking6.\n\nUsing post-mortem human brain tissue, Leggio’s lab later showed that people with alcohol-use disorder have elevated levels of GLP-1 receptors in key reward-related regions of the brain7. Leggio suspects that this reflects an adaptive response: alcohol dampens the body’s GLP-1 production, and so the brain boosts expression of the hormone’s receptors to preserve sensitivity to it in circuits that govern reward and motivation.\n\nThese results, together with a growing number of animal studies, solidified GLP-1’s connection to addictive behaviour. Yet it was not until May 2023 that the story spilled into the public eye. The Atlantic magazine published an article about people taking semaglutide who said their urge to smoke or drink had faded. ‘Did Scientists Accidentally Invent an Anti-addiction Drug?’ it was headlined. “That was definitely a turning point,” says Leggio, who suddenly found himself getting calls from journalists.\n\nThe first few rigorous trials, however, had largely disappointing results. A 2022 study in Denmark, led by psychiatrist Anders Fink-Jensen at the University of Copenhagen, found that weekly treatment with exenatide — a ‘first-generation’ GLP-1 compound used since 2005 to treat diabetes but never approved for weight loss — did not substantially reduce the number of heavy drinking days in people diagnosed with alcohol dependence8. A 2023 trial in Switzerland likewise found that dulaglutide, another older GLP-1 drug, did not help people to quit smoking9.\n\nBut other results suggested that the drugs might have an effect. In a trial10 involving 20 people with opioid-use disorder, led by Grigson and psychologist Scott Bunce, also at Pennsylvania State University, treatment with liraglutide — another first-generation GLP-1 drug — reduced opioid craving by roughly 40%. And when Fink-Jensen’s team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at the brains of people taking exenatide in their clinical trial, they saw muted activity in reward-related regions when the participants viewed images of alcoholic drinks8.\n\nBut the first-generation drugs tested in these preliminary studies are much less potent than agents such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. These second-generation compounds bind more tightly to the GLP-1 receptor, stay active in the body for longer and have shown greater benefits across a range of health conditions. So, could these latest drugs change the behaviour of people struggling with substance misuse?\n\nThat’s what researchers are now examining in a raft of clinical trials with hotly anticipated results. Fink-Jensen and his colleagues have already tested whether the high dose of semaglutide approved for weight loss can cut alcohol intake in 108 people with alcohol-use disorder and obesity, in a clinical trial that wrapped up earlier this year. He says the results should be published in early 2026.\n\nIn the United States, meanwhile, Leggio and Simmons are each leading independent but coordinated randomized trials testing injected semaglutide in moderate-to-heavy drinkers who meet the diagnostic criteria for problematic alcohol use. Leggio’s trial will involve 52 people and test the high-dose Wegovy form of the drug, whereas Simmons’s trial, involving 80 people, is testing the lower-dose Ozempic, typically prescribed for diabetes. And psychologist Joseph Schacht at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora has been running his own alcohol trial with the oral version of semaglutide (marketed as Rybelsus). By coordinating their efforts, the three teams hope to tease apart how differences in dose and delivery affect outcomes.\n\nSchacht says that the pills, although less potent than injections, could be more appealing to people with alcohol addiction, many of whom also have a history of using injectable drugs such as fentanyl. “They can be gun-shy around needles, because that is a cue related to injection drug use,” he says.\n\nIn all of these trials of semaglutide for alcohol dependence, the research teams are also using fMRI to capture before-and-after snapshots of the brain to show how the drug alters responses to alcohol-related prompts, such as drinks or photos. This could reveal whether and how the drug disrupts the brain’s drive for alcohol — the reward-seeking sense of ‘wanting’ that fuels addiction. The imaging results might also show brain activity patterns that are more common in people who benefit from GLP-1 therapy than in those who don’t. “It may give us a better understanding for whom the drug works best,” Simmons says.\n\nResearchers are already piecing together a picture of how GLP-1 drugs act on the brain’s reward system. They know from animal models that rewarding substances — alcohol, nicotine, opioids, food — activate similar neural circuitry. This links deep brain structures such as the ventral tegmental area, where neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine originate, to the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine signals arrive and register as pleasure. Normally, every sip, puff or hit sends a jolt of rewarding dopamine through this circuit, teaching the brain to want more and reinforcing addictive behaviour.\n\nGLP-1 receptors sit on neurons throughout this network and, when triggered, are thought to reduce the flow of dopamine and other chemical messages to make rewarding experiences feel less compelling. When drugs such as semaglutide mimic GLP-1, they blunt the dopamine response and the compulsion to repeat the addictive behaviour fades away.\n\nStress responses come into play as well, animal studies show. When drugs activate GLP-1 receptors in brain regions such as the amygdala, they help to mute the surge of stress hormones that accompany anxiety, withdrawal and craving. This dual action — calming both the urge and the unease — could help to explain why the therapies seem to reduce not only consumption but also relapse, at least in rodents.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03911-x\n\nHendershot, C.

    "description": "Rivian's autonomy chief James Philbin told Business Insider that the cost of lidar, a sensor that can be found in robotaxis, is no longer expensive.",
    "fullText": "For Rivian's chief of autonomy, the decision to put in lidar for the EV company's coming R2 SUV was obvious.\n\nJames Philbin, Rivian's VP of autonomy and AI, told Business Insider that the price of lidar has decreased significantly enough in recent years to be able to put the sensor inside a personally-owned, mass-production vehicle.\n\n\"It's been on this incredible cost curve, where 10 years ago, it would be just unimaginable that you could put a lidar on a consumer vehicle. And now it's getting into that price point, kind of in the range of a radar,\" Philbin said. Radar, a sensor that uses radio waves, is commonly seen in modern cars that have an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) or blind spot detection.\n\nLidar is a sensor that uses laser light to measure depth. While it's historically been used for topography, the sensor has gained more visibility in the automotive world with the advent of self-driving cars.\n\nMost notably, Waymo's robotaxis have multiple lidar sensors, including the spinning lidar on the roof of the vehicle. Waymo has said that lidar provides additional safety to the vehicle's AI driver.\n\nOn Thursday, Rivian announced a road map to fully autonomous driving, which includes building an in-house chip and installing a lidar sensor in the company's coming SUV, the R2.\n\nPhilbin, who previously worked at Zoox and Waymo, told Business Insider that lidar makes an autonomous system \"more robust\" and can help the company get to its self-driving goal \"faster.\"\n\n\"It's very affordable,\" he said. \"The performance it gives you for that cost is really amazing. And so to me, it's kind of a no-brainer that you would want more sensors and more modalities for something that's so safety critical.\"\n\nUsing lidar diverges from the strategy of Rivian's main EV competitor, Tesla, which has taken a strong stance on pursuing self-driving with cameras only.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk once called lidar an expensive \"crutch.\"\n\nIn the late 2000s, during the days of the Google Self-Driving Car Project, a single lidar unit could come with a five-figure price tag. Today, industry leaders say a similar unit could cost a few hundred dollars.\n\nRivian employees, including Philbin, did not disclose the cost of the lidar unit in the R2 when asked by Business Insider.\n\nR2 will first be launched without the sensor in early 2026. It's slated to be Rivian's cheapest car to date, with a starting price of $45,000. The company aims to launch an R2 with lidar in late 2026.\n\nWhen asked what the cost difference was to put a lidar in the R2, Philbin declined to comment but said that it was \"not a significant consideration.\"",

    "fullText": "A humanoid robotics startup in Silicon Valley appears to have an acceptance rate lower than any Ivy League university.\n\nFigure AI has been flooded with résumés since its founding in 2022, according to the startup's founder and CEO, Brett Adcock.\n\n\"Just checked, 176,000 job applications at Figure the last 3 years,\" he wrote in an X post on Saturday. \"We've hired ~425 people.\"\n\nThat amounts to a hiring rate of about .24% within the three years. Adcock wrote that most of the submissions were \"slop.\"\n\nThe spread of the 176,000 applications over the three years is unclear. Adcock did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven if the number of applications were divided equally among the years Figure AI was operating — just under 59,000 applications a year — the acceptance rate would still be lower than that of the hardest university to get into. Caltech had the lowest acceptance rate of 3%, according to US News & World Report's rankings list.\n\nAdcock wrote in the comments of his X post that the review process has been a slog.\n\n\"We go through these one by one like a monkey — it's incredibly time consuming,\" he wrote.\n\nAccording to the CEO, the \"ATS\" or applicant tracking system — a software employers use to sift through résumés — can't save a lot of time if a company is being barraged with hundreds of thousands of applications.\n\n\"In the ATS it takes at least 20 seconds of button clicks per submission even if it's garbage,\" he wrote.\n\nAdcock did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA company like Figure AI sits right in the intersection of two trends within the job market.\n\nToday's job candidates aren't applying to just a handful of roles. Business Insider's chief correspondent Aki Ito reported that the average job opening saw 242 applications, citing data from Greenhouse, a leading ATS platform.\n\n\"Applying to a job in 2025 really is the statistical equivalent of hurling your résumé into a black hole,\" Ito wrote.\n\nOn the other hand, Figure AI operates in one of the hottest spaces of the tech industry, that is, robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nTop tech firms like Meta and OpenAI are in the midst of an AI talent war, offering up to seven- to nine-figure pay packages just to poach superstar AI researchers.\n\nEven tech startups are scrapping for AI talent, floating higher equity packages and other perks that may not come as easily at a big company, such as a co-founding title or more time for research.\n\nFigure AI happens to be one of the leading names in the humanoid robotics space.\n\nThe company recently raised more than $1 billion in its Series C funding round — with backing from Parkway Venture Capital, Brookfield Asset Management, and Nvidia, among others — for a $39 billion valuation.\n\nAdcock said on X that he may need to find another way to sift through résumés.\n\n\"Need a model to do this for us better, maybe I'll work on one,\" he wrote.",

If you started one in 2023, you are likely struggling.\nIf you sold Hand Sanitizer in 2019, you were weird. In 2020, you were a genius.\n\nMost aspiring entrepreneurs look for \"Business Ideas.\" Smart entrepreneurs look for \"Market Signals.\"\n\nThe internet is not just a communication network; it is a Global Consciousness. Every day, billions of people type their fears, desires, and problems into search bars and forums. This data stream contains the blueprint for the next Unicorn—if you know how to read it.\n\nThis guide will teach you the art of Trend Hacking: The scientific process of using AI to scan the global data-stream for \"rising waves\" before they hit the shore.\n\nWe will show you exactly how to use the Market Signal Analyzer to find your Blue Ocean, validate it for $0, and scale it before the competition even wakes up.\n\nEvery trend follows a mathematical curve known as the Gartner Hype Cycle, modified for the viral internet age. Understanding this curve is the difference between catching the wave and crashing.\n\nThe Market Signal Analyzer Advantage:\nMost free tools (Google Trends) only visualize Phase 3. By the time a line goes vertical on Google Trends, the market is saturated. The Signal Analyzer detects the \"Velocity of Discussion\" in Phase 1, giving you a 6-month head start.\n\nBefore you build, you must filter your ideas through the \"Triad of Profit.\" A valid business idea must pass all three filters.\n\nPeople pay to stop pain. They rarely pay for \"vitamins.\"\n\nMonopolies are hard to kill. You want fragmented, messy markets.\n\nHere is your Saturday Morning workflow. Follow this exactly to generate 5 valid ideas in 30 minutes.\n\nDon't just trust the keyword. Understand the driver.\n\nAsk: \"What are the biggest complaints about current solutions?\"\n\nYou have found a \"Bleeding Neck\" (Fines) in a \"Fragmented Market\" (New Law) with \"Wallet\" (Funded Startups). This is a million-dollar signal.\n\nLet's look at real-world examples of founders who used this methodology to win.\n\nThe biggest mistake founders make is building the product before selling it.\nOnce you have the Signal, run a \"Smoke Test.\"\n\nThe Market Signal Analyzer gives you the data foundation, but the Smoke Test gives you the truth.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to SaaS. If you are a content creator, this is your cheat code.\n\nIn 2025, 'Intuition' is a liability. Data is an asset.\nThe founders who win are not the \"Visionaries\" staring at the stars. They are the Scientists staring at the data.\n\nThey don't guess what the market wants. They measure it. They intercept the demand.\n\nYou don't need to be a genius to build a million-dollar business. You just need to be First. And to be first, you need the Signals.\n\nStop staring at a blank whiteboard. The answers are floating in the data stream right now. You just need the right net.\n\nYou have the blueprint.

    "fullText": "Marketing automation used to mean \"scheduling emails.\" In 2025, it means \"replacing the marketer.\"\n\nThe landscape has shifted. The goal is no longer to make your marketing team faster; the goal is to build a system that runs without them.\n\nThis is the age of the Autonomous Growth Engine.\n\nWe are witnessing the most significant shift in business economics since the Industrial Revolution. The \"Cost of Cognition\" is dropping to zero. Tasks that previously required expensive humans—writing strategy, editing video, analyzing data—can now be executed by autonomous agents for fractions of a cent.\n\nIf you are a founder, a CMO, or a growth hacker looking to dominate your niche without burning cash on headcount, this is your blueprint. We will break down exactly how to architect a \"Zero-Touch\" marketing strategy that operates 24/7/365.\n\nTo understand where we are going, we must understand why the old model is dead.\n\nIn 2021, the standard advice for a Series A startup was:\n\nThis created massive OpEx (Operating Expense) bloat. When the market turned, these startups died. They couldn't move fast enough because every decision required a meeting.\n\nToday, a \"One-Person Unicorn\" can out-execute a 50-person team.\n\nThe competitive advantage of the next decade is not \"Talent.\" It is \"Architecture.\" Can you architect a system that scales infinitely?\n\nJust like self-driving cars, marketing automation has levels. Most companies are stuck at Level 2.\n\nThis guide is about moving you from Level 2 to Level 3 immediately.\n\nTo build a Level 3 system, you need three core engines working in harmony. We call this the \"Trinity of Autonomy.\"\n\nThe Goal: Dominate \"Share of Voice\" without typing.\n\nTotal Human Time: 5 Minutes (Review & Approve).\nTotal Output: 1 Pillar Page + 10 Social Assets.\n\nThe Goal: Broadcast-quality production at \"TikTok Speed.\"\n\nVideo is the highest-converting asset class, but traditionally the hardest to automate. Not anymore.\n\nAn AI Video Agent doesn't just \"make video\"; it engineers retention.\n\nThe Result: You can test 20 different video angles in a single day. A human team would take a month to shoot one concept.\n\nThe Goal: Turn traffic into revenue without sales calls.\n\nTraffic is vanity. Revenue is sanity. An autonomous system doesn't just drive clicks; it ensures they buy.\n\nThe biggest reason landing pages fail is \"The Maker's Blind Spot.\" You love your product, so you assume everyone else gets it. They don't.\n\nThis creates a \"Self-Healing Funnel.\" The system identifies leaks and proposes patches before you bleed revenue.\n\nYou have the theory. Here is exactly what to do, week by week.\n\nDon't turn on ads yet. You need Authority.\n\nLet's look at the hard numbers. This is what you save by moving to Vect AI.\n\nThis is not a \"saving.\" This is a War Chest. You can take that $359k and pour it into paid acquisition, product development, or just profit.\n\nThe future belongs to the founders who leverage leverage.\n\nArchimedes said, \"Give me a lever long enough, and I shall move the world.\"\nIn 2025, AI is the lever.\n\nYou don't need a team. You need a system. You don't need overhead. You need output.\n\nThe tools are here. The playbook is open. The only question is: Will you hire people, or will you hire the OS?\n\nYou have the blueprint. Now you need the engine. Launch the AI agent for \"Marketing Video Ad\" and get results in minutes.",

    "description": "Does today's Wordle have you stumped? Here are some hints and the answer.",
    "fullText": "Hey, there! We hope you're having a great weekend. If you're looking for a little help with today's Wordle, you've certainly found it. Here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Sunday's puzzle (#1,639).\n\nIt may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that as well.\n\nWordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that debuted in 2021. There is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.\n\nWordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that shows how they fare each day in a spoiler-free way. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.\n\nThe New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.\n\nTo start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard. However, you can still use those letters in subsequent guesses.\n\nYou'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.\n\nWordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets and Discord. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.\n\nIf you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,600 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.\n\nIn addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.\n\nBefore today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed:\n\nYesterday's Wordle answer for Saturday, December 13 — MISER\n\nEvery day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word.\n\nIn case you still haven't quite figured it out by that point, we'll then provide the first letter of the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle.\n\nThis should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly. Spoilers are ahead.\n\nHere is a hint for today's Wordle answer:\n\nWhat a batting coach might help a baseball player improve.\n\nThere are no repeated letters in today's Wordle answer.\n\nThe first letter of today's Wordle answer is S.\n\nThis is your final warning before we reveal today's Wordle answer. No take-backs.\n\nDon't blame us if you happen to scroll too far and accidentally spoil the game for yourself.\n\nWhat is today’s Wordle? Today's Wordle answer is...\n\nNot to worry if you didn't figure out today's Wordle word. If you made it this far down the page, hopefully you at least kept your streak going. And, hey: there's always another game tomorrow.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Hundreds of police officers were scouring the Brown University campus along with nearby neighborhoods and poring over video in the hunt for a shooter who opened fire in a classroom, killing two people and wounding nine others.\n\nThe search stretched late into the night, well after the shooting erupted Saturday afternoon in the engineering building of the Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island, during final exams.\n\nSurveillance video released by police shows the suspect, dressed in black, calmly walking away from the scene. His face is not visible and investigators said it wasn't clear whether the suspect is a student.\n\nThe suspect was last seen leaving the engineering building and some witnesses told police the suspect, who could be in his 30s, may have been wearing a camouflage mask, Providence Police Deputy Chief Timothy O’Hara said.\n\nUniversity President Christina Paxson said she was told 10 people who were shot were students. Another person was injured by fragments from the shooting but it was not clear if the victim was a student, she said.\n\nThe search for the shooter paralyzed the campus, the nearby neighborhoods filled with stately brick homes and the downtown in Rhode Island's capital city. Streets normally bustling with activity on weekends were eerily quiet.\n\nStudents sheltered in place for hours into the night. Officers in tactical gear led students out of some campus buildings and into a fitness center where they waited. Others arrived at the shelter on buses without jackets or any belongings.\n\nMayor advised people to stay home\n\nInvestigators were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom. Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said.\n\nHe encouraged people living near the campus to stay inside or not return home until a shelter-in-place order was lifted.\n\n“The Brown community’s heart is breaking and Providence’s heart is breaking along with it,” Smiley said.\n\nAuthorities believe the shooter used a handgun, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Dan McKee vowed that all resources were being deployed to catch the suspect. Rhode Island has some of the strictest gun laws in the U.S.\n\nNine people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island Hospital, where one was in critical condition. Six required intensive care but were not getting worse and two were stable, hospital spokesperson Kelly Brennan said.\n\nExams were underway during shooting\n\nEngineering design exams were underway when the shooting occurred in the Barus & Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department. The building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices, according to the university’s website.\n\nEmma Ferraro, a chemical engineering student, was in the building’s lobby working on a final project when she heard loud pops coming from the east side. Once she realized they were gunshots, she darted for the door and ran to a nearby building where she sheltered for several hours.\n\nFormer ‘Survivor’ contestant just left the building\n\nEva Erickson, a doctoral candidate who was the runner-up earlier this year on the CBS reality competition show “Survivor,” said she left her lab in the engineering building 15 minutes before shots rang out.\n\nThe engineering and thermal science student shared candid moments on “Survivor” as the show’s first openly autistic contestant. She was locked down in the campus gym following the shooting and shared on social media that the only other member of her lab who was present was safely evacuated.\n\nBrown senior biochemistry student Alex Bruce was working on a final research project in his dorm directly across the street from the building when he heard sirens outside.\n\n“I’m just in here shaking,” he said, watching through the window as armed officers surrounded his dorm.\n\nStudents in a nearby lab turned off the lights and hid under desks after receiving an alert about the shooting, said Chiangheng Chien, a doctoral student in engineering who was about a block away from the scene.\n\nMari Camara, 20, a junior from New York City, was coming out of the library and rushed inside a taqueria to seek shelter. She spent more than three hours there, texting friends while police searched the campus.\n\n“Everyone is the same as me, shocked and terrified that something like this happened,” she said.\n\nBrown, the seventh oldest higher education institution in the U.S., is one of the nation’s most prestigious colleges with roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students. Tuition, housing and other fees run to nearly $100,000 per year, according to the university.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are barely moving, refusing to react to the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.13%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.53%.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nDiscover 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rates.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nWant to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025? Here's what to do.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how today's interest rates would affect your monthly mortgage payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You also have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues, if applicable. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped with those of the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDig deeper into 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to get an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nFirst of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\n\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\n\nWhich is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.13% right now. But keep in mind that mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect mortgage interest rates to significantly drop before the end of the year. They may inch down here or there, but they probably won't plummet.\n\nOverall, mortgage rates have dropped gradually. The 30-year fixed rate is still below where it was one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nWith mortgage rates hovering above 6%, is now a good time to refinance your mortgage? Learn what factors to consider when deciding if you should refinance.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.",

    "fullText": "Van Giesen Street was under about two feet of water Saturday morning as the Yakima River overflowed its banks and surged into businesses and homes.\n\nIt rose to the level considered major flood stage — 16 feet at the Kiona gauge near Benton City — at 3 a.m. Saturday.\n\nVan Giesen was closed to both eastbound and westbound traffic between South 38th Avenue in West Richland and Highway 240 in Richland by 10:30 p.m. Friday, according to a Washington state Department of Transportation official.\n\nEarlier at least one lane of the roadway had been underwater and closed to traffic.\n\nThe water was forecast to drop to just below 16 feet by Saturday evening.\n\nThe Yakima River has not been this high near the Tri-Cities since the February 1996 flood, when the river reached nearly 21 feet at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kiona gauge, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.\n\nThe flooding water was flowing into Richland to the west of the bypass highway in the Van Giesen Street area Saturday morning.\n\nAt the Richland Riders Club, a stream of pickups hauling horse trailers carrying their animals to safety were pulling out of the equestrian boarding and riding facility on Van Giesen Street in Richland before noon Saturday.\n\nEarlier Saturday morning there was just a trickle at the club, but that rose to about three feet before noon.\n\nAt the Buckskin Golf Course in Richland, golfers played until dark Friday as owner Jeff Marcum kept an eye on nearby pastures that flood before water reaches his courses.\n\nAt 9 p.m., he grew concerned and started moving golf carts out of cart sheds and barely beat the rising water.\n\n“I was still chasing my tail about three in the morning,” he said.\n\nWater covered the entire course Saturday morning, including the lawn out front and the driving range, and had reached the interior of the pro shop.\n\nThis was the first year since he built the business in 1998 on Bronco Lane not far from the Columbia Basin Racquet Club in Richland that flooding has crossed Bronco Lane to the west, he said.\n\nIt’s the first time his driving range has been underwater and that he has had water in his buildings, he said.\n\n“We got a whopper this time,” he said.\n\nHe was watching the water level on a stake he pounded into the ground and the water was continuing to rise just before noon, he said.\n\nOnce the water starts to drop, it goes down quickly, he said. He’s hoping to reopen by Christmas.\n\nThe Yakima River is expected to drop to just over 11 feet at the Kiona gauge by Tuesday, but then to start to rise again. It could crest at 13.5 feet Friday morning, considered minor flood stage, according to early predictions by the National Weather Service.\n\nFlooding of rivers and streams in the Mid-Columbia was caused by a strong atmospheric river that dumped rain in the Cascade Mountains early in the week, melting snow and swelling rivers.\n\nAnother atmospheric river is expected to hit Washington and Oregon Monday. It is not forecast to be as strong or as warm. Heavy snow is expected in the Cascade Mountains.",

    "description": "The girl lay in a makeshift health clinic, her eyes glazed over and her mouth open, flies resting on her lips.  It was the last moment to save her life, said Bethsabee Djoman Elidje, the women's health manager, who led the clinic's effort as the heart monitor beeped rapidly.  The girl had an infection after a sexual assault, Elidje said, and had been in shock, untreated, for days.",
    "fullText": "DOUANKARA, Mauritania (AP) — The girl lay in a makeshift health clinic, her eyes glazed over and her mouth open, flies resting on her lips. Her chest barely moved. Drops of fevered sweat trickled down her forehead as medical workers hurried around her, attaching an IV drip.\n\nIt was the last moment to save her life, said Bethsabee Djoman Elidje, the women's health manager, who led the clinic's effort as the heart monitor beeped rapidly. The girl had an infection after a sexual assault, Elidje said, and had been in shock, untreated, for days.\n\nHer family said the 14-year-old had been raped by Russian fighters who burst into their tent in Mali two weeks earlier. The Russians were members of Africa Corps, a new military unit under Russia's defense ministry that replaced the Wagner mercenary group six months ago.\n\nMen, women and children have been sexually assaulted by all sides during Mali's decade-long conflict, the U.N. and aid workers say, with reports of gang rape and sexual slavery. But the real toll is hidden by a veil of shame that makes it difficult for women from conservative, patriarchal societies to seek help.\n\nThe silence that nearly killed the 14-year-old also hurts efforts to hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe AP learned of the alleged rape and four other alleged cases of sexual violence blamed on Africa Corps fighters, commonly described by Malians as the “white men,” while interviewing dozens of refugees at the border about other abuses such as beheadings and abductions.\n\nOther combatants in Mali have been blamed for sexual assaults. The head of a women’s health clinic in the Mopti area told the AP it had treated 28 women in the last six months who said they had been assaulted by militants with the al-Qaida affiliated JNIM, the most powerful armed group in Mali.\n\nThe silence among Malian refugees has been striking.\n\nIn eastern Congo, which for decades has faced violence from dozens of armed groups, “we didn’t have to look for people,” said Mirjam Molenaar, the medical team leader in the border area for Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, who was stationed there last year. The women \"came in huge numbers.”\n\nIt's different here, she said: “People undergo these things and they live with it, and it shows in post-traumatic stress.\"\n\nThe aunt of the 14-year-old girl said the Africa Corps fighters marched everyone outside at gunpoint. The family couldn't understand what they wanted. The men made them watch as they tied up the girl’s uncle and cut off his head.\n\nThen two of the men took the 14-year-old into the tent as she tried to defend herself, and raped her. The family waited outside, unable to move.\n\n“We were so scared that we were not even able to scream anymore,” the aunt recalled, as her mother sobbed quietly next to her. She, like other women, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, and the AP does not name victims of rape unless they agree to be named.\n\nThe girl emerged over a half-hour later, looking terrified. Then she saw her uncle's body and screamed. She fainted. When she woke up, she had the eyes of someone “who was no longer there,” the aunt said.\n\nThe next morning, JNIM militants came and ordered the family to leave. They piled onto a donkey cart and set off toward the border. At any sound, they hid in the bushes, holding their breath.\n\nThe girl's condition deteriorated during the three-day journey. When they arrived in Mauritania, she collapsed.\n\nThe AP came across her lying on the ground in the courtyard of a local family. Her family said they had not taken her to a clinic because they had no money.\n\n“If you have nothing, how can you bring someone to a doctor?” the girl’s grandmother said between sobs. The AP took the family to a free clinic run by MSF. A doctor said the girl had signs of being raped.\n\nThe clinic had been functioning for barely a month and had seen three survivors of sexual violence, manager Elidje said.\n\n“We are convinced that there are many cases like this,\" she said. \"But so far, very few patients come forward to seek treatment because it’s still a taboo subject here. It really takes time and patience for these women to open up and confide in someone so they can receive care. They only come when things have already become complicated, like the case we saw today.”\n\nAs Elidje tried to save the girl's life, she asked the family to describe the incident. She did not speak Arabic and asked the local nurse to find out how many men carried out the assault. But the nurse was too ashamed to ask.\n\nScratch marks are part of story she could not tell\n\nThousands of new refugees from Mali, mostly women and children, have settled just inside Mauritania in recent weeks, in shelters made of fabric and branches. The nearest refugee camp is full, complicating efforts to treat and report sexual assaults.\n\nTwo recently arrived women discreetly pulled AP journalists aside, adjusting scarves over their faces. They said they had arrived a week ago after armed white men came to their village.\n\n“They took everything from us. They burned our houses. They killed our husbands,” one said. “But that’s not all they did. They tried to rape us.”\n\nThe men entered the house where she was by herself and undressed her, she said, adding that she defended herself “by the grace of Allah.”\n\nAs she spoke, the second woman started crying and trembling. She had scratch marks on her neck. She was not capable of telling her story.\n\n“We are still terrified by what we went through,” she said.\n\nSeparately, a third woman said that what the white men did to her in Mali last month when she was alone at home “stays between God and me.”\n\nA fourth said she watched several armed white men drag her 18-year-old daughter into their house. She fled and has not seen her daughter again.\n\nThe women declined the suggestion to speak with aid workers, some of whom are locals. They said they were not ready to talk about it with anyone else.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to questions, but an information agency that the U.S. State Department has called part of the “Kremlin’s disinformation campaign” called the AP’s investigation into Africa Corps fake news.\n\nWagner has a legacy of sexual abuse\n\nAllegations of rapes and other sexual assaults were already occurring before Wagner transformed into Africa Corps.\n\nOne refugee told the AP she witnessed a mass rape in her village in March 2024.\n\n“The Wagner group burned seven men alive in front of us with gasoline.” she said. Then they gathered the women and raped them, she said, including her 70-year-old mother.\n\n“After my mother was raped, she couldn’t bear to live,” she said. Her mother died a month later.\n\nIn the worst-known case of sexual assault involving Russian fighters in Africa, the U.N. in a 2023 report said at least 58 women and girls had been raped or sexually assaulted in an attack on Moura village by Malian troops and others that witnesses described as “armed white men.\"\n\nIn response, Mali’s government expelled the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Since then, gathering accurate data on the ground about conflict-related sexual violence has become nearly impossible.\n\nThe AP interviewed five of the women from Moura, who now stay in a displacement camp. They said they had been blindfolded and raped for hours by several men.\n\nThree of the women said they hadn't spoken about it to anyone apart from aid workers. The other two dared to tell their husbands, months later.\n\n“I kept silent with my family for fear of being rejected or looked at differently. It’s shameful,” one said.\n\nThe 14-year-old whose family fled to Mauritania is recovering. She said she cannot remember anything since the attack. Her family and MSF said she is speaking to a psychiatrist — one of just six working in the country.\n\nAid workers are worried about others who never say a thing.\n\n“It seems that conflict over the years gets worse and worse and worse. There is less regard for human life, whether it’s men, women or children,” said MSF’s Molenaar, and broke into tears. “It’s a battle.”\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "fullText": "Joe’s Crab Shack was never as big as Red Lobster or one of the other chains, but it was a common enough site for folks through the years.\n\nUnfortunately, it might not have been a common enough stop. Because, as well known as the seafood chain was, it’s footprint of nearly 150 restaurants across the country is now down to less than 20.\n\nIn fact, Tasting Table reported that the company’s website currently shows just 15 active restaurants.\n\nSo, how did things get so bad for Joe’s?\n\nWell, Tasting Table reported that the chain actually began to struggle back in the mid-2010s due to the increase in cost of seafood. That came while its sales began decreasing, and at least some of that was self-inflicted because Tasting Table noted that as well known as Joe’s was, it actually rated it as one of the worst seafood chains in business.\n\nThe outlet said lease expirations also hit Joe’s hard, particularly in 2017, when the chain dropped from 112 locations to 70 from June to August. That number was down to 30 last year, and now … again, just 15.\n\nSo, for fans of Joe’s, that is obviously pretty concerning news.\n\nJoe’s was founded in 1991, according to Tasting Table, and was sold in 1994 to Landry’s Inc. JCS Holdings, which became Ignite Restaurant Group, bought Joe’s in 2006, and Landry’s bought it again in 2017.\n\nIf things continue to go downhill at the rate they have, though, there may be nothing left for Landry’s to sell this time around.",

    "fullText": "Jalen Brunson's first 40-point game of the year couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nThe All-Star point guard dropped a season-high on Saturday night to lead the Knicks over the Orlando Magic and advance to the NBA Cup Championship on Tuesday night in Las Vegas.\n\nBrunson's scoring outburst came on 16-of-27 shooting (59.3 percent), despite going 2-of-5 from three-point land and only making six free throws. He also added in eight assists, four rebounds, and a steal over 39 minutes in the 132-120 win.\n\nAfter the victory, Brunson spoke with the NBA on Prime crew about his performance and how his game continues to improve, especially on the big stages.\n\n\"I think the way we've been playing, I've been able to get a couple more catch and shoots. I have a lot of confidence in my shot,\" Brunson said. \"I work way too hard not to be confident. Sometimes it's going to go in, and when it's going in I'm just going to keep firing them.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old was then asked by former two-time MVP Steve Nash about his \"touch around the rim\" and how that keeps getting better over the course of his career.\n\n\"It's something I had to learn,\" Brunson said. \"Obviously I'm not the tallest and I'm not jumping over people... My game's unique. I play off balance. I'm on balance, but most people wouldn't be. That's the stuff I work on, just be deceiving. I've done it for a long time and it keeps getting better and better like you said.\"\n\nBrunson's previous season-high in scoring was 37 points, which he's had twice this year (against the Heat on Oct. 26 and vs. the Bucks on Nov. 28). He's now averaging 28.3 points per game over 22 contests and has scored 30-plus points in four consecutive games.\n\nNew York, winners of five straight games, will need Brunson to continue playing with that confidence to keep their streak going on Tuesday night in the NBA Cup Championship against the winner of the Thunder-Spurs semifinal game.\n\n\"I work way too hard not to be confident ... my game is unique.\"\n\nJalen Brunson tells the crew about the parts of his game that keep getting better. pic.twitter.com/D83qzUnMmF\n\n— NBA on Prime (@NBAonPrime) December 14, 2025",

    "fullText": "WWE Saturday Night’s Main Event Results (Dec. 13, 2025)\n\nAJ Styles & Dragon Lee vs. Je’Von Evans & Champion Leon Slater\n\nTonight at WWE’s Saturday Night’s Main Event, the incomparable career of pro wrestling icon John Cena comes to a ceremonious end.\n\nIn the evening’s main event, the future WWE Hall of Famer will take on two-time World Heavyweight champion Gunther in his retirement match. However, the card inside the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, will also include a few other notable matchups.\n\nWWE champion Cody Rhodes will face his NXT counterpart Oba Femi. Women’s division legend Bayley will take on star prospect Sol Ruca, and the current World Tag Team champs, AJ Styles and Dragon Lee, will face NXT’s Je’Von Evans and TNA X-Division title holder Leon Slater.\n\nBelow you can find all the night’s results and the best highlights from each match.\n\nRhodes and Femi delivered an entertaining match, and one of the biggest takeaways was how over the NXT star is that the crowd was split for this one. Unfortunately, after a good start to the show, it ended in disqualification due to interference from Drew McIntyre. That terrible end to the match drops the grade from a B+ to B-.\n\nWinner: Rhodes vs. Femi ends in disqualification after interference from Drew McIntyre\n\nLISTEN TO THOSE OBA CHANTS!!! 🔊#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/4FvMQYpcGu\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nOBA FEMI TAKES CONTROL AGAINST CODY RHODES!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/emPKUGRb49\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nWHAT A SPINEBUSTER 🔥🔥#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/tFXYc9jOfv\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nOBA LAUNCHES INTO CODY WITH AN UPPERCUT OVER THE ANNOUNCE TABLE!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/e2O6MN8mcX\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nDrew McIntyre spoiled the fun, but Oba Femi has no mercy.

    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the iconic career of WWE legend John Cena will get a ceremonious end. His match with Gunther will conclude a year-long retirement tour where he took part in many entertaining matchups. However, during the tour and throughout his career, there were several dream matchups that wrestling fans missed out on.\n\nWith his career officially over, we look at six matches wrestling fans never got during John Cena’s incomparable career.\n\nDespite being on the roster together during both of Drew McIntyre’s two stints in WWE, he never faced Cena. He was also a popular pick to get a match with the legend during his 2025 tour. Yet, the stars never aligned, and the future Hall of Famer never got to face the current and best version of the “Scottish Psycho.”\n\nLA Knight nearly got his opportunity to face Cena, but came up just short to Gunther in the “Last Time is Now Tournament” final. It would have made sense for Knight to face Cena and win as a passing of the torch moment. The former United States champion would have also been a good opponent option during Cena’s short heel run. Alas, it never happened.\n\nCena wasn’t a star during Bill Goldberg’s first run in WWE, but he was an icon when he made his surprise return in the late 2010s. A dream match between them at WrestleMania could have been epic as the two powerhouses and wrestling greats went toe-to-toe in a match few would have expected. Yet, the company chose to have the former WCW champion focus on a long feud with Brock Lesnar instead of a matchup with John Cena.\n\nJey Uso eliminated John Cena in this year’s Royal Rumble. There were rumblings about a match between the two after that, but it never happened. A clash between the two would have been a lot of fun since they are two of the most beloved characters in WWE right now. Instead, Uso was busy in the World Heavyweight title picture for much of 2025.\n\nTo many wrestling fans, Japanese icon Kazuchika Okada is seen as NJPW’s version of Cena. That is why the two facing off is a unique dream match some fans hoped to see. However, when Okada chose to sign with AEW in March of last year, it killed any chance of that matchup ever happening.\n\nRic Flair has faced many elite stars from multiple generations. However, John Cena was not one of the. The idea of the long-time leader for most world title reigns facing the man who would eventually beat his record could have been interesting, but they never went toe-to-toe in that short period during the end of Flair’s run as an active competitor in WWE.\n\nShane McMahon, surprisingly, got to face many WWE legends during his part-time run wrestling in his father’s company. Yet, despite getting huge matchups with all-time greats like The Undertaker, Steve Austin, and The Rock, McMahon never got a one-on-one match with Cena. The bout probably would have been a lot of fun, especially the build-up to the unexpected bout.\n\nSaturday Night’s Main Event Results: Highlights From John Cena Retirement Match & Grades\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden\n\nMLB Free Agency Predictions: Projecting Landing Spots for Top 5 MLB Free Agents Right Now",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis season has seen a close race in the AFC South, mainly between the Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, and Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFor the Jaguars, they had an eventual season, they also lost their second overall draft pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, Travis Hunter, to a season ending knee injury after only seven games, but beating the Kansas City Chiefs on an improbable scramble by Trevor Lawrence in the fourth quarter, and are currently on a four-game winning streak, with the last two wins coming over division rivals while leading the South.\n\nOn Sunday, the team will look to continue its momentum when it hosts the New York Jets, who are 3-10 and in the running for the first draft pick in the 2026 draft, which will feature the likes of Heisman trophy winner Fernando Mendoza.\n\nWith a win, it will be the first time the team has reached 10 wins in a season since 2017, when they made a run to the AFC conference championship game before losing to the New England Patriots, 24-20, with a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nObviously, those teams are complete opposites, which emphasizes just how long it has been for the Jaguars to have a solid season with playoff aspirations. Trevor Lawrence is hoping to lead the team to their second playoff appearance as the starting quarterback.\n\nBased on how things currently stand, the last three games for the Jaguars after Sunday are winnable, with one more game against the Tennessee Titans, who have struggled in Cam Ward's first year, and the Colts, who have recently turned to a 44-year-old Philip Rivers to take over as their starting quarterback.\n\nThe only game they may not be favored in is the Week 16 showdown versus Bo Nix and the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium.",

Shortly after he won college football’s highest honor, the brand paid tribute.\n\nAdidas released a video honoring Mendoza after he won the Heisman on Saturday night. The brand paid homage to his viral quote following the Big Ten Championship when the IU quarterback told FOX Sports’ Jenny Taft, “The Hoosiers are flippin’ champs.”\n\nThroughout the year, Mendoza not only became one of the biggest stars on the field, but one of the top names in the sport. He has a $2.6 million On3 NIL Valuation as Indiana soon prepares for the College Football Playoff as the No. 1 seed.\n\n@IndianaFootballpic.twitter.com/xafU0DhsLC\n\n— adidas US Football (@adidasFballUS) December 14, 2025\n\nJust before IU took on Ohio State in Indianapolis, Mendoza announced his high-profile NIL deal with adidas. He is the latest college football star to partner with the Three Stripes, joining Ohio State receiver Jeremiah Smith and Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola, among others.\n\n“Excited to share that I’ve accepted an opportunity to join adidas!” Mendoza wrote in a LinkedIn post. “I’m very grateful for everyone who has supported me along the way and excited to bring my passion for sport, leadership, and work ethic to the Three Stripes. Let’s get to work.”\n\nMendoza led the nation with 33 touchdown passes this year while completing 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards, to just six interceptions. Additionally, his $2.6 million On3 NIL Valuation ranks No. 5 in college football and No. 7 in the On3 NIL 100, the first of its kind and defacto NIL ranking of the top 100 high school and college athletes ranked by their On3 NIL Valuation.\n\nFernando Mendoza beat out Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia for the award, garnering 643 first-place votes and 2,362 points. Pavia got 189 first-place votes and 1,435 points. It’s the latest chapter in a special season for the former Cal star, who helped lead Indiana to its first outright Big Ten title since 1945.\n\nAfter the announcement, Mendoza delivered a passionate speech. As he wrapped, he had a message for young athletes who think they’re not getting enough attention or are ranked high enough.\n\n“The truth is, you don’t need the most stars, hype or rankings,” Mendoza said. “You just need discipline, heart and people who believe in you. And you need to believe in your own abilities. I hope this moment shows you that chasing your dreams are worth it, no matter how big or impossible they seem.”",

    "title": "Online Piracy Can Boost Box Office Revenue, Study Suggests",
    "description": "A new academic study counterintuitively concludes that online piracy can boost box office revenue for some films.",
    "fullText": "The general belief in Hollywood is that piracy causes billions of dollars in lost revenue and is predominantly harmful.\n\nHowever, if research has shown anything over the years, it’s that piracy can have positive effects too.\n\nIndeed, a new study from researchers at Monash University and San Jose State University, published in Research Policy, provides fresh evidence for this. It suggests that, under the right conditions, piracy can boost box office ticket sales.\n\nThe paper, titled “Avengers assemble! When digital piracy increases box office demand”, uses a dataset that matches U.S. box office revenue with the timing of high-quality piracy releases between 2004 and 2020.\n\nThe researchers find that the impact of piracy on movie theater attendance differs for various types of films.\n\nFor this study, the researchers make a distinction between “Spectacle” films, which include stunning visual blockbusters or action flicks, and “Story” films, such as dramas and comedies.\n\nSpectacle films are broadly defined as movies where the in-theater experience significantly adds to the experience. For example, through stunning visuals and immersive surround sound. Story films, however, rely more on the dialogue, screenwriting, and acting—qualities that can also be enjoyed on a laptop or TV.\n\nAfter categorizing the films, the researchers analyzed a dataset of U.S. box office figures, matching these with upload data from The Pirate Bay to track when high-quality pirated copies appeared online. Since the timing of these pirate releases is quasi-random, the research effectively infers a causal effect of piracy on box office revenues, depending on the movie type.\n\nThese narrowed-down results are striking. While piracy seemingly hurt dramas and comedies, it appears to act as a promotional tool for ‘spectacle’ films, driving audiences to the movie theater rather than keeping them at home.\n\nThis isn’t a small effect either. The study estimates that high-quality pirate releases increase weekly box-office revenue by approximately 24.4% for spectacle films. For story films, the effect flips, as pirate releases lead to a 26.6% decline in weekly box-office revenue.\n\n“Our research shows that digital piracy does not harm all movies equally,” says the paper’s co-author Wendy Bradley, who works as an assistant professor of management at San José State University. She notes that, for spectacle-oriented films, piracy can act as a nudge to go to the box office.\n\n“Watching a pirated copy may convince people that the real value of the film comes from the shared cinematic experience, not just the story, and encourage them to watch in theaters. In contrast, story-driven movies are more vulnerable because piracy is a better substitute for in-theater visits,” Bradley says.\n\nThis is corroborated by the paper’s lead author, Klaus Ackermann, who notes that some movies are simply better suited for today’s movie theater experience.\n\n“A romantic comedy or ‘chick flick’ like 27 Dresses offers a limited in-cinema experience by itself, while Marvel movies are a different story,” Ackermann notes, adding that movie theaters have already started to respond to this by offering more ‘experiences’ and special events.\n\nImportantly, the positive effects on box office revenues are unique to high-quality piracy leaks, which include “BluRay” or “HD” rips. The researchers found that low-quality versions, including CAM rips, consistently hurt box office revenues across all genres.\n\nThe impact is substantial here as well, as low-quality pirate releases were typically linked to a 24% drop in box office revenues.\n\nWhile these results may seem counterintuitive, the authors have statistically ruled out several alternative explanations. That said, the study relies on a quasi-random research design that tried to simulate causality. Therefore, follow-up research is needed to replicate and potentially expand these spectacular results.\n\nThe paper suggests that future research may also want to consider the effect of piracy on legal streaming subscription services like Netflix, or other forms of entertainment, such as video games.\n\nFor the movie industry, the paper once again suggests that a focus on adding value is key to competing with piracy. This is in line with research we covered last month, which showed that investments in the movie theater experience can help deter piracy.\n\nBradley stresses that their research indicates that piracy does not have to be met with more enforcement all the time. Instead, studios may want to focus on offering a better theater experience. Then, high quality pirate releases serve as promotion.\n\n“My takeaway for studios is that digital piracy isn’t going away,” Bradley says.\n\n“Rather than fighting it predominantly through legal means, whether that be lobbying for anti-piracy policy or expensive IP litigation, studios can strategically design, price, and release movies so that theatrical value becomes harder to replicate at home,” she concludes.\n\nAckermann, K., Bradley, W.

Grinning rez dogs with patchy coats rested in the sidewalk shade outside an alternative public high school called Buffalo Hide Academy, where lunch was ending. Students ambled into a warehouse-sized classroom with a podium and some tables at the far end, and musical instruments in a corner by the teacher’s office. Student artwork and a Blackfeet Nation flag bedecked the walls alongside a mural of a buffalo skull and the school’s name in dripping red letters. The kids didn’t sit in rows or take out homework; nobody checked whether they were on time. They shuffled around in grubby Converse, joking with each other at full volume. Some picked up instruments and started jamming with their teacher, Robert Hall (Piikunii), who was already messing around on the drum kit. It got loud, fast.</p>\n<p>“I would describe Browning as metal,” Hall told me, seated at the drums in a luau shirt and bushy black ponytail, his ferocious brown eyes the size of jawbreakers. “We don’t turn away from the darkness,” he said. “We don’t hide our own ugliness, the way that people in big cities could hide.” The town is rough, even by rez standards. “There’s buildings that have been standing just in a void. No humans, no life running through these buildings for years,” Hall explained. “But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”</p>\n<p>Another teacher, Charlie Speicher, warmed up the mic. “Who likes chaotic mathcore?” he tried, referring to a rhythmically unpredictable subgenre of hardcore punk that he describes as “bonkers” and “all over the place.” Two hands went up. One was mine. “That makes three of us,” said Speicher as he pulled up a YouTube video.</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338255) -->\n<p>The students were finishing the inaugural year of Buffalo Hide Academy’s semester-long, two-hour heavy music symposium dedicated to the study of metal and hardcore. Speicher, who’s non-Native, is a clinical counselor and also Buffalo Hide Academy’s director. The symposium was his brainchild. He and other teachers hand-picked students who looked like they might be isolated, or might be into darker, more aggressive art and music — kids who might be potential metalheads. More than fifty students initially enrolled. By the end of the first semester, kids were sneaking out of other classes to join.</p>\n<p>Speicher teaches in his “battle vest,” a staple of metal fashion that’s usually denim hand-studded with metal pyramids or spikes, and stitched with patches showing band logos in barbed, rootlike scripts impossible for the uninitiated to decipher. In addition to providing a feeling of physical protection, battle vests are threshold guardians that intimidate normies while signalling to dedicated fans who recognize the glyphs. If you know, you know — and you’re family. If not, fuck off. But Speicher is here to welcome kids into the fold, where a community of music fans understands their suffering. Or, as he put it later, “to create more safety and protection specifically from suicidal distress,” which he said has impacted every family in Browning.</p>\n<p>Some in Browning think he’s doing the devil’s work, but Speicher is as warm and approachable as a cool youth pastor, speaking gently and smiling easily through a handsome swath of stubble. His vest is emblazoned with the gaunt face from Converge’s 2001 album <em>Jane Doe.</em> He showed the kids the music video to “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY-JkeXK4dU\">Farewell, Mona Lisa</a>” by mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan. It sometimes sounds like Dick Van Dyke’s fancy footwork flawlessly executing a trip and stumble. “Goes hard, huh? What’d you see? What’d you hear?”</p>\n<p>It’s precise and complicated, students said. The guitars and drums are in conversation, mirroring each other. The drumming starts like black metal blast beats but switches into a groove. Rough vocals alternate with intelligible singing. Guitars are in standard tuning, not drop-tuning like most metal. The fashion is different from metal too – less theatrical. One student noted the singer’s contorted body language: “He’s feeling his emotions while he’s letting the art out of him.”</p>\n<p>“Mmm, beautiful,” Speicher said. Later, students looked at landscape photos and guessed which heavy genre or subgenre they represented: a frozen forest for black metal; a crumbling alley for doom; an urban protest for hardcore; an alligator swamp for death metal. They discussed “geographic determinism,” the theory that music is shaped partly by its place of origin.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But Speicher wasn’t just there to nerd out. He shifted seamlessly into an overview of heavy music’s therapeutic benefits: catharsis, community and coping skills. “Heavy music teaches us things such as we’re not alone; when life is dark, we do something about it. We’re not just a prisoner to that darkness. But also that our risk fluctuates, that our misery isn’t gonna last forever. There are ways through it.” Students doodled in notebooks, idly plucked at an unplugged bass guitar, or held hands under the table.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A history lesson from another teacher on the ’80s and ’90s Scandinavian origins of black metal — including its problematic elements, like murder and Nazism among some bands — served as a caution to consume media critically. While hardcore is overtly political and tends hard left, the morality of metal is murkier, oriented primarily around pushing extremes and attacking social norms. Results can be chaotic. This segued into a high-level, student-led conversation about whether and when to separate art from artist. In another lesson, Speicher said, they’d studied the Vietnam War through the lens of Black Sabbath, whose 1970 staple “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ssFjyDIyQ0\">War Pigs</a>” critiqued American involvement.</p>\n<p>“Your homework tonight, and I’ll remind you of this later, go listen to the song ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiKjcrniJKY\">43% Burnt</a>.’” Speicher told students to pay special attention to an influential breakdown at the end. They broke off to paint each other’s faces in “corpse paint,” and take album cover-style photos with animal skulls and hides. Emily Edwards (Piikunii), an almost-15-year-old, schooled me on Swedish rock. “You don’t know Ghost?” she said. Inspired by the class, Edwards and some friends had started their own band, Crimson Harmony. Edwards was one of many students who signed up for a paid internship at an upcoming metal festival called Fire in the Mountains coming to Blackfeet Nation later that summer. Festival internships were part of why teachers started the symposium.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nicholas Rink (Piikunii), who teaches Blackfeet studies and language, pulled me aside, brimming with excitement. He was painting the skull of a buffalo the students helped process. Across its brow he’d painted overlapping bear paws, mother and cub, in flame colors. He dotted them with pinprick white stars — Ursa Major and Minor, which he said both Piikunii and European traditions recognize as bears. The skull was a gift for Norwegian festival headliners Wardruna, whose latest album, <em>Birna</em>, was named in honor of the bear. Rink had aligned the painted stars to match the position the real stars would take when Wardruna performed beneath them in Blackfeet Nation.</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338259) -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\">\n<!-- RTT removed image (338258) -->\n<!-- RTT removed image (338257) --><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">(<em>Clockwise from top</em>) Students apply corpse paint at Buffalo Hide Academy in May.

Speicher said it hit the entire community “like a sledgehammer.” He called up a fourth grade teacher in Rathdrum, Idaho, named Steve Von Till, whom metalheads might recognize as a doomy poet-troubadour and the former Neurosis guitarist. Speicher, Hall, Rink, Von Till and a few others banded together to help their students stay alive, as if building a protective fire to shelter them in the darkness. They called themselves the <a href=\"http://firekeeperalliance.org/\">Firekeeper Alliance</a>.</p>\n<p>A few years earlier, the crunchy-pagan festival Fire in the Mountains was priced out of gentrifying Jackson, Wyoming. Speicher spoke to its owners about bringing the festival to the rez. He planned to build internships into his class to connect kids with career pathways in an industry of like-minded people. It sounded perfect. But first they needed buy-in from tribal council.</p>\n<p>The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council has long supported youth through athletics, especially running and basketball. Dipping into the arts, specifically music — to say nothing of metal — would be new territory. But Councilman Everett Armstrong told me that because it was for the kids, they considered it. “Let’s try to go a different route to give our youth something that they can open our minds to, open our hearts to, find themselves,” he said.</p>\n<p>It could help the nation economically, too, Armstrong said. The reservation lies along the imaginary line splitting Piikunii homelands into the colonial annex called Glacier National Park. The park is an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/news/tourism-to-glacier-national-park-contributes-548m-to-local-economy.htm\">over-half-billion-dollar industry</a>. But many Piikunii people, Armstrong said, live in poverty. It’s one of the factors contributing to the widespread suicidal distress that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html\">disproportionately harms Native communities</a>. When I told folks I was going to Blackfeet Nation, most didn’t know where that was, until I mentioned Glacier. The monied Glacier Park Lodge had a gift shop peddling Glacier mementos — but, despite being on the reservation, offered nothing I could take home that says “Blackfeet Nation.” “We need to try to tap into that and try to get some revenue back into the Blackfeet Reservation,” Armstrong said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the festival to work, they needed bands big enough to draw fans to the rez. So in August 2024, the Firekeepers flew to Boulder, Colorado, to court pagan folk band Wardruna, whose world tour was starting at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Speicher and the gang wanted to meet in person and convince them to play Blackfeet Nation. It’s for the children, they would say. Norwegian and Piikunii cultures share traditions of animism. The Firekeepers brought sweet pine ties, used for smudging, as gifts, and met Wardruna at the C.U. Boulder library. They didn’t know the band was already sold on the idea. Singer Einar Selvik had spoken to Speicher on the phone, and they were ready to say yes.</p>\n<p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert,” Selvik told me, “all the pieces just fit so well together.” It was a major get for the festival. Rink said they stayed up all night talking about it. Their vision and the Nordic stars had aligned.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<!-- RTT removed image (338261) -->\n<!-- RTT removed image (338262) --><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">&nbsp;Steve Von Till <em>(left</em>) and Wardruna lead singer Einar Selvik <em>(right</em>) during the festival.&nbsp;<strong>Russel Albert Daniels/High Country News</strong></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><strong>Dance Intertribal</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>LATE JULY: AMTRAK UNLOADED A GAGGLE OF BLACK DENIM</strong> and bandanna-clad metalheads onto the small, sunny platform at East Glacier Park, Montana, a tiny seasonal town 15 minutes outside Browning. Two days earlier, Ozzy Osbourne, the grandfather of metal and lead singer of Black Sabbath, had died.</p>\n<p>Because it was the festival’s first time on a reservation, nobody knew what to expect. Festivals, after all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/27/fyre-festival-2-mexico\">can go very badly</a>, and no one wanted to remember this as “Fyre” in the Mountains. But good omens greeted us. Our Lord and Savior Ozzy must have parted the week’s rainy spell for a few days of perfect festival weather: high 70s, partly cloudy, cool after sunset.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Firekeeper Alliance distributed tickets to the local community, and invited Blackfoot attendees from Canada. Others road tripped in, or flew into Kalispell, around 2,400 fans — a third of them Natives, Speicher and Rink estimated — converging from across the continent for three days and 23 bands.</p>\n<p>On the festival grounds, the party opened not with a land acknowledgement but a welcome from the land’s actual Indigenous people. In proper Native fashion, they held a grand entry, and true to form, it started late. “We’re runnin’ on Indian time!”&nbsp; shouted Hall through a megaphone, war-whooping and half-dangling from the back of a motorcycle that Speicher peeled across the rugged ground.</p>\n<p>As the crew finished setting up a stage in the distance, hundreds of metalheads sat watching in a circle while Piikunii locals in regalia danced fancy, traditional, chicken, jingle and grass. Young Grey Horse hammered the drum and Hall let his rowdy demeanor emcee, throwing out Charlie Hill jokes to keep the mood light. For many, it was a transformative moment. Some fans had never been to a powwow and were encountering Indigenous culture for the first time.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hall called for an intertribal — an all-inclusive dance. The metalheads hesitated, but after a few courageous outliers broke onto the grass, others followed, bouncing a circle in their battle vests and black jeans, like a respectful, slow-motion mosh pit, as they awkwardly tried to two-step like the pros. A showboating school-aged fancy dancer twirled past them in her shawl, rapid-fire footwork leaving them in the dust. But the dance was a welcome, not a competition. Hearts were opening. People cheered, Natives and non-Natives together.</p>\n<p>For Selvik, the powwow was a powerful way “to set the tone, to open the circle.” This festival required some vulnerability of attendees, some deference. We were guests on Piikunii lands. There would be no alcohol — a marked adjustment for metal culture. It would be, as Hall declared, “a cultural exchange between the Piikunii and metalheads.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><strong>Fringe Culture</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>“ON MY RESERVATION, PEOPLE ONLY LISTEN TO TWO THINGS:</strong> rap or hip-hop,” joked Logan Mason (Colville), who traveled from Spokane and volunteered with the camping crew in exchange for festival admission. Mason lost his brother and nephew to suicide, and metal helped him work through depression in his late teens and early 20s. “Growing up, I did not know anybody else that listened to black metal or death metal.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On other reservations, it’s different. The Navajo Nation, for example, has a genre-defining “<a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/photos-heavy-metal-music-in-the-navajo-nation-award/\">rez metal</a>” scene. Some folks joke that you’re either a hip-hop Native or a metal Native. If anything, Natives seem over-represented in the metal community. “A lot of it is land-based,” said Meg Skyum (Oji-Cree), who’d come to the festival from Ontario to see the Native black metal outfit Blackbraid and get a sneak preview of their third album. Atmospheric black metal in particular is “about the fucking trees and shit,” which Natives appreciate. Plus, Natives and metalheads, Skyum added, both live in the margins of ordinary society. “We’re fringe, they’re fringe.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“The metal tribe itself seems to attract a lot of people that go through different types of struggle,” said Tomas Falomir (Ojibwe, Hopi and Zuni Pueblo descent) from Parker, Colorado, noting that the music is healing, the community welcoming. “Any type of person could be included.”</p>\n<p>There’s also something about the sound, Falomir added. “It almost goes with the loudness, and even down to the beat of it.” Other fans agreed. The thundering drums and powerful vocals resemble a modernized version of Native music, one said. Pomona-based Indigenous death/doom project Tzompantli would later exemplify this, shaking the festival grounds with stomping downtempos from a battalion of traditional and contemporary drums. And European bands like Wardruna, fans noted, are really, <em>really</em> into their cultures, especially pre-Christian traditions, just like Natives.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma,” said Damien Jones Jr. (Diné), who traveled with family from Lukachukai in Navajo Nation, and brought one of the festival’s most-photographed battle vests, decked out with turquoise geometrics and a “Frybread Power” backpatch<em>.</em> Jones plays saxophone — classical and jazz. “That’s what I do as well, throw all my feelings and emotions into music.”</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338288) -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><strong>Dark Horse, Ride</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>“WELCOME TO THE BACKBONE OF THE WORLD,” </strong>read the sign at Red Eagle Campground, where the Rockies arched like the knobby vertebrae of a sleeping Elder God half-buried in sediment. Across glassy Two Medicine Lake an amphitheater of pines presided like a chorus between the water line and a low timberline. On the near bank, a footpath wound along the edge of the lake, opening to beach access here and there with pop-up canopies and scatterings of hay-bale seats for workshops and panels on Indigenous sovereignty, ethnobotany, the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous people, and the therapeutic effects of heavy music.</p>\n<p>A cluster of interconnected meadows transformed into parking lots, a village of glamping yurts, a small bazaar of vendor tents, and the “stage bowl”: a shallow glen with two stages set up between tipis serving as green rooms. Curtains of savory smoke stoked saliva as Montana “off-grid catering” team <a href=\"https://www.regionsauvage.com/\">Region Sauvage</a> barbecued ducks and student-processed buffalo. High school interns decorated the stages with skulls, antlers, driftwood, witchy-Indigenous pieces of the forest. Edwards worked the merch tent, hawking Firekeeper Alliance shirts that showed a malevolent spirit of suicide haunting a tipi where Native kids sheltered around a fire. Proceeds supported suicide prevention. Shirts sold out the first day. Parking attendants and security all seemed suspiciously chill. It was intentional, they explained. Natives are used to being followed and scrutinized. Nobody wanted that atmosphere here.</p>\n<p>First on stage was Sage Bond (Diné and Nde), an up-and-coming acoustic metal singer-songwriter from Tonalea in Navajo Nation, who’d previously toured in support of suicide prevention efforts on her reservation. Bond matched the mountain sunshine with a low snarl a la Eddie Vedder, before breaking into a roar the size of 10 mountain lions — what she called “the Cookie Monster vocals.” Bond expected a sparse crowd drifting in and out, but her performance captivated hundreds. It was a big moment — her first time playing a festival that size, which she jokingly called a “black metal Coachella” (though the only feather headdresses were on tribal council members). “How the heck did they even find me?”</p>\n<p>Turns out Bond was recommended by Chicago black metal artists Pan-Amerikan Native Front. During their set, they invited students onstage to headbang alongside the singer, Kurator of War, in black-and-white face paint and crossed bullet sashes. Other students held up a Blackfeet Nation flag&nbsp; and tossed their long hair next to barrel-chested guitarist Necroboar (Purépecha), who looked mean as hell in spiked leather cuffs, but later, backstage, was beaming. “A lot of people are thanking us for being here with the kids,” Necroboar said, “but it’s like you don’t understand what this means to us to be here and to see them.” He told me he and his bandmates saw themselves in the teenagers. Misty-eyed fans agreed, knowing they would remember this moment forever. The band had rehearsed their set that morning at Buffalo Hide Academy with the kids. They’d always wanted to play a rez. Being here was a dream come true. “I’m still shaking from it,” Necroboar said.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<!-- RTT removed image (338264) -->\n<!-- RTT removed image (338263) --><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">&nbsp;Sage Bond <em>(left</em>) and Liłith singer and guitarist Heather Jordan <em>(right</em>) perform during the festival. <strong>Russel Albert Daniels/High Country News</strong></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Musicians didn’t quarantine themselves. Many hung out with fans — riding horses, paddleboarding, doing yoga by the lake, attending workshops and panel discussions, or headbanging in the crowds. By the food stands selling frybread with huckleberry butter, metalheads set up a little table as an altar to Ozzy. It gathered river rocks, feathers, cigarettes, and trinkets. “Long Live the Prince of Darkness,” read a sign at the feet of a grinning Ozzy bobblehead and some candles.</p>\n<p>Twenty-four weeks pregnant, Heather Jordan (Diné) delivered a scorching set in the sunshine with her masked drummer pummeling the kit behind her. Jordan is the singer and guitarist for Navajo Nation blackened doomgaze duo Liłith. She’d wanted to play Fire in the Mountains because favorites like Wolves in the Throne Room preceded her. And it helped that this year’s festival focused on “the Native side of things.” Jordan works a day job at a restaurant serving tourists on her own rez, which is also dry. “It’s like the hardest thing for them to understand,” she said. When Fire in the Mountains invited Liłith, their answer was “Hell, yes.”</p>\n<p>The festival’s spirituality attracted Jon Krieger of Blackbraid, a solo recording project that blew up overnight when his first single, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buh0h-8zrP4\">Barefoot Ghost Dance on Blood Soaked Soil</a>,” got traction on YouTube in 2022. “All the black metal that’s the best in the world in my opinion comes from the heart,” Krieger said. Blackbraid was one of around five Native bands playing the festival, though Krieger, who was adopted, doesn’t know his tribal affiliation. Black metal is a spiritual genre, he said, and while it’s dominated by “Scandinavian dudes talking about old Norse religion and culture,” the values align. “Anti-Christianity is something that we share with them.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On stage later, beneath an array of a dozen stag skulls, Krieger was slinking around like a ghostly Indigenous Jim Morrison, windmilling his waist-length hair, blasting life force through a cedar flute and leaning over the crowd to shriek upward-arcing shards — whose strength never flagged during his entire blistering set — as his guitarist crowned his howls with constellations of tremolo picking. In the mosh pit, one fan hoisted a buffalo rib the size of a baseball bat, presumably from the barbecue, like some feral invocation. Blackbraid’s performance may have converted Daniels, the photographer, to solid metal fandom. But after Converge, he stood by me and said, “Now I get it.”</p>\n<p>Converge was another get, one of Speicher’s favorites. Bassist Nate Newton had Zoomed into Speicher’s classroom to chat music with students. So had Ivar Bjørnson from Enslaved — A-listers, donating their time to Browning rez kids.</p>\n<p>Before Converge played, Speicher and the other Firekeepers presented them with a buffalo skull painted with the iconic <em>Jane Doe</em> face. And they gifted the buffalo’s tongue, the most prized part of the animal, to tribal council.</p>\n<p>A mosh pit opened in the center of the crowd as soon as Converge blasted forth, the biggest and most fearsome pit yet. The chaos of bodies in conflict summoned a dust devil from the Earth into the sky. It might not look like it, but there’s a shared ethic at work, what Hall called “consensual fucking violence, man.” If you get a bloody nose, you can be proud. If you fall, fans pick you back up. We aren’t fighting. By bracing and colliding, we’re helping each other. The rush is purifying. The release, stabilizing. Jumping in, you might want to die, but when the pit spits you out, you’ll be beaming like Necroboar — happy to have survived the maelstrom.</p>\n<p>Partway through Converge’s set, skinny, sleeve-tatted frontman Jacob Bannon passed the mic to a Piikunii youth, who seamlessly took over the chorus of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV4x5DsES9w\">Dark Horse</a>.”</p>\n<p><em>We’ll show the demons<br />For what they are<br />Dark!<br />Horse!<br />Ride!<br />Towards the light!</em></p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338626) -->\n<p>He knew every shout and scream by heart, absolutely commanding the stage. The crowd was living for it.</p>\n<p>Musicians understood the assignment and turned it up to 11, new blood and seasoned pros alike. As dusk settled, staff closed the lakeside trails, mindful of everyone’s safety, while Finnish folk metal band Hexvessel sang about people disappearing into the forests. After dark, fans gathered around a bonfire to ward off the chill. Wardruna took the stage and spread their haunting ambience to the woods’ inky edges. Someone dressed like a wizard slipped through the crowds as a human figure with antlers danced silhouetted before a glowing tipi. High above a membrane of diffuse gray, the bear stars slowly turned.</p>\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>A Strange Road to Joy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A FULL MAP OF METAL'S SPRAWLING SUBGENRES</strong> is hard to pin down. But for what it’s worth, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Musical_subgenres_by_genre\">Wikipedia lists 34 subgenres and 16 sub-subgenres</a> of metal, rivalled primarily by much broader genres like pop, rock, and opera, the latter which has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_opera_genres\">120</a> subgenres. <em>Encyclopaedia Metallum</em> lists <a href=\"https://www.metal-archives.com/browse/genre\">16 main subgenres</a>, but sub-subgenres and combinations seem unlimited.</p>\n<p>Like opera, much of metal prioritizes the voice — though as an aesthetic inversion. Similar to Inuit throat singing, vocalizations are guttural and challenging to master. Like wine, metal adheres to a pedigree whose sense experience reflects a place of origin: Cascadian black metal, for instance, is hazy as the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest. And like European classical music, or jazz, metal ranges in style from ambient drone to bombastic spectacle to precise and unpredictable arrangements astonishing to perform.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“We’ve all&nbsp;had periods&nbsp;of hurt. And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But something deeper draws metalheads together, perhaps a willingness to inquire on levels the establishment forbids. What most clearly sets it apart from other genres is that it’s so rooted in anger and sadness — or their common ancestors: terror, lack, isolation and despair. Metal, one fan told me, is “a strange road to joy.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve all had periods of hurt,” Kurator of War said, seated on a folding chair next to Von Till with singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe, Newton and Bjørnson. No makeup, no bullets. Behind them, morning clouds rippled like flags on the glacier-crisp pebble beds of Two Medicine Lake. “And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.” A crowd of metalheads sat cross-legged on the grass, or perched on hay bales in the partial pine shade, listening to the panel. “I think we’re all curious. I think we’re all empathetic. I think we want to get to that other side of connection and knowledge.”</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338628) -->\n<p>Speicher lobbed questions that prompted an intimate conversation about the healing power of heavy music, which at times drew tears — from fans and musicians. Von Till said heavy music is a way of “getting rid of the sickness,” which helps him become more sensitive and vulnerable. He also noted the importance of catharsis. “How many times has that moment of release prevented that one moment in a kid that can’t be retaken?”</p>\n<p>Early in Bjørnson’s life, he realized people had to be athletic or good looking for acceptance in some groups. “With the metal gang, the qualification was being into metal,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It’s not like this kind of stuff attracts normal people. Like we all — you’re weird. You’re all weird,” Newton said to ripples of laughter and cheers. “And it’s beautiful. We could be completely different but we have this one thing that we both understand: why we’re into it.”</p>\n<p>“It’s them that are weird,” Von Till parried. “We’re the normal ones, right? Fuck that.” More cheers.</p>\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Oh, Lord, Yeah</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ON THE THIRD DAY, THE SKY RENT IN TWO.</strong> Just as the evening drained of color, the power went out — halfway through a set by Virginia headbangers Inter Arma.

Then the familiar tick of a tempo rose from the drummer’s high hat cymbals. The crowd started laughing, cheering, singing. It was “War Pigs” — Sabbath. Colorful stage lights fired back up. When the metalheads sang “Oh, Lord, yeah!” the sneer of Ozzy’s voice carried like mist across the many, a phantom formed by hundreds of mouths in unison. Re-amped guitars picked up the lick to complete the collective homage. Piikunii highschoolers sieged the stage again, drumming powwow style alongside the band.</p>\n<p>Nigh had the crowd caught its breath when lightning flashed like a Catholic schoolteacher flicking the lights. Thunder murmured from the belly of the Rockies beyond a ridgeline that blurred into rolling gray. Another flash. Closer, noted Daniels, the photographer; maybe two second’s delay. Sparse droplets swelled to a downpour. The lightless heavens opened, the Prince of Darkness summoned.</p>\n<p>“This is metal,” a festival staff member in a Day-Glo vest shouted to fans gathered under the merch tent. He wasn’t speaking metaphorically. The tent’s frame could draw lightning. “Shelter in your cars or tents!” he ordered. “Go, now! <em>Now!”</em> Metalheads scrambled for cover, evacuating in slick mud.</p>\n<p>Daniels and I found ourselves with some new friends, ducking into the yurt of one of the musicians, Rebecca Vernon, founder of Salt Lake City doom-sludge band SubRosa, who now performs a solo piano project called The Keening. She invited us in, offered us snacks, made sure we were all safe and hydrated. We laughed together, Natives and non-Natives, prisoners of the darkness, speculating about whether Inter Arma had summoned the spirit of Grandfather Ozzy and he was messing with us from — wherever he was. We worried the next set might be canceled. It was one of the headliners, Old Man’s Child, a fan favorite that helped define the Norwegian black metal sound in the early days. In over 30 years, Old Man’s Child had never played in the United States. But they’d agreed to play Blackfeet Nation.</p>\n<p>“Debuting in a setting like this adds depth to the moment,” singer Galder <a href=\"https://knotfest.com/blogs/from-the-artist/galder-discusses-old-man-s-child-s-homecoming-and-american-debut-at-fire-in-the-mountains\">told the website <em>Knotfest</em></a> before the festival. “There’s something about the rawness and unpredictability of the natural world that mirrors what I try to capture in Old Man’s Child. The beauty in the darkness, the stillness before the storm, the feeling of something ancient just beneath the surface.” That ancient unpredictability may have just gotten the better of his grand North American debut.</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338269) -->\n<p>A scream rang through the night. Or a shout? It was hard to understand, like metal vocals. I unzipped the door flap. The rain had stopped. The shouts rang clearer a second time: “Show’s back on!” We jammed our feet back into soggy shoes and boots.</p>\n<p>It was fully nighttime when the storm’s misery passed. A string of fans with phone flashlights and headlamps meandered back down the muddy path and over a little footbridge, across a babbling brook to the clearing where the bonfire flared bright and warm between the stages, belching embers upward like some inverted underworld rain. From a distance, the returning metalheads looked like a serpent of stars.</p>\n<p>By firelight we danced with a Piikunii grandmother in a silk bandanna to Dio’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrBUjXaRSUQ\">Rainbow in the Dark</a>,” euphoria setting in from the topsy-turvy snafu and the might of nature, which had banished all traces of late-festival fatigue. Then finally, riding in on the heels of the thunderstorm, Old Man’s Child took the stage. Galder, in corpse paint, dispatched legions of fog wraiths, strobe spectres galloping across a sea of electrified faces. A beautiful hell broke loose, exorcising our collective and personal demons. The festival — the ceremony — was complete.</p>\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>‘Our ancestors held ceremony together’</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ON SOCIAL MEDIA, FANS WERE STUPID WITH ENTHUSIASM </strong>about the weekend: <em>“Pure magic,”</em> <em>“transformational,”</em> <em>“profound,</em>”<em> “life changing.” </em>They posted reports of unexpected tears and healing. One Instagram comment called it the “the most incredible metal festival I’ve been to, and it was my 3rd one this summer.” Others called it the best music festival they’d been to of any genre. Daniels, newly baptized, joined the chorus: “<em>I have joined the cvlt.”</em></p>\n<p>And it wasn’t just the music. The consensus seemed to be that the lack of alcohol actually enhanced the experience. Frank Godla, co-founder of digital publication <em>Metal Injection</em>, said he learned <a href=\"https://metalinjection.net/show-recap/fire-in-the-mountains-2025-rewrote-the-script-of-what-a-heavy-metal-fest-could-should-be\">more about Native people at this festival</a> than he ever had from books or documentaries. Wardruna echoed the many in posting humble thanks to the Blackfeet Nation: “There are so many people out there in the world who deeply sympathize and stand with you and your ancestors in all your struggles. I am one of those people,” Salnik captioned a picture of himself on stage, proudly holding aloft the hand-painted buffalo skull. “It was like our ancestors held ceremony together and their meeting is rippling as we speak.”</p>\n<p>And the learning was two-way: Tribal Chairman Rodney “Minnow” Gervais took the stage to remark on how kind and diverse the metalheads were, how clean they kept the grounds. “Be proud of yourselves,” he said. “What you see here is proof that music transcends religion, color, whatever you want. It brings us all together.”</p>\n<p>“They look scary,” Councilman Armstrong told me about the metalheads, “but they’re some of the nicest people. They’re so welcoming.” People I spoke to in East Glacier agreed. Armstrong said tribal council is now considering branching into music events of other genres, too.</p>\n<p>“It’s heartwarming to have a full circle moment for me,” Mason, the fan from Spokane, said, seeing Native culture come together with the music he loves, in support of a cause close to his heart. “I was like damn, was this festival calling me?” After interning at the merch tent, Edwards said she might pick a different long-term job, but does see herself working in the music industry. And she wants to keep playing in a band when she is older, Crimson Harmony or otherwise.</p>\n<p>As stray metalheads sat around the grand foyer of Glacier Park Lodge, leaning on their backpacks or napping on the sofas, waiting for the evening train, a classical guitarist plucked out a polished-up version of the Led Zeppelin classic “Stairway to Heaven.” On the train back to the West Coast, the metalheads hung out as new friends. In the observation car, they shared weekend highlights, Natives and non-Natives together.</p>\n<p>A week later, I saw Von Till and Vernon again, this time in Portland, the last stop on Von Till’s summer tour before the new school year. We were still thinking about the festival. We tried to pin down what it was about Fire in the Mountains that still had us sobbing intermittently a week out. Von Till nailed it: “It made me dare to hope.”</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338267) -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Can You Imagine</strong></p>\n<p><em>“If there’s a world where we don’t have to worry about suicide, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about bullying, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about violence, about war.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I feel like that world wouldn’t work.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“You could try to picture it, but it never really fully comes into view.”</em></p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338268) -->\n<p><em>“I feel like it needs to be talked about.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I like to daydream about that a lot.”&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>“These are things I think about too much and I don’t have too many spaces to set them out of my mind.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“There’d probably be a lot more people at the reservations, and more family and connection.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Those little subtle moments that we all share, of sitting next to the fireplace, or sharing a new book, making a new friend, all of that would still keep expanding in mysterious ways of goodness.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Everyone just being creative.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“It looks probably a little bit like heaven.”</em> &nbsp;</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n<p>If you’re considering suicide, please call or text <strong>988</strong>, or chat online at <strong><a href=\"http://www.988lifeline.org\">988lifeline.org</a></strong>, for a free, confidential conversation with a trained crisis counselor.

    "description": "A judge will have to make some changes to the original ruling, though.",
    "fullText": "However, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nHowever, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nApple has lost its appeal of a massive district court ruling in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic Games.\n\nThat April ruling from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple “willingly” failed to comply with a 2021 order allowing mobile app developers to link to payment options outside of Apple’s, and she barred Apple from charging a commission on in-app purchases using external payment links, among other restrictions. In today’s opinion, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.\n\nGonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”\n\nBut the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting any fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.\n\nThe panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”\n\nThe opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”\n\nApple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from Bloomberg and Schaeffer’s Investment Research about the ruling.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.\n\nThat is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.\n\nA slowing economy hits the luxury market\n\nA prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.\n\nMany car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.\n\n“Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.\n\nThat trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.\n\nChinese automakers take a bigger bite\n\nWhile luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.\n\n“Their (Chinese carmakers’) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,” Yuan said. “That’s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.”\n\nThe Chinese brands’ share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.\n\nBYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for “new energy vehicles,” which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.",

    "fullText": "Summiting Mount Everest is not just a major feat of human endurance; it also requires immense preparation, knowledge, and environmental awareness.\n\nProspective climbers need to meet prerequisites, undertake a brutal training regimen, and spend a significant amount of money to even attempt it.\n\nHowever, you'd never guess that looking at a short video shared on Reddit's r/InterestingAsF***. ()\n\nMount Everest covered in waste, including lots of human excrement \n byu/batninam3000 ininterestingasfuck\n\nIt wasn't clear precisely where on Everest the footage was taken, but the conditions depicted were unacceptable in any natural setting.\n\n\"Mount Everest covered in waste, including lots of human excrement,\" the post's title read. While the breathless narrator's commentary was difficult to hear over the wind, the words \"dirty camp\" were clearly audible.\n\nAbandoned tents, discarded climbing gear, and mountains of waste rivaling Everest itself were visible in every direction.\n\nAs National Geographic noted, Everest was first summited in 1953, and in the intervening decades, it has become the \"world's highest garbage dump.\" The outlet added that the broader site, Sagarmatha National Park, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.\n\nUNESCO's Cleaning Everest page, published in 2013, explained that commercially organized expeditions began in the 1980s, and with them, a waste management problem developed.\n\nClimbing Mount Everest is notoriously deadly, with mortality rates ranging between 1% and 6% of all climbers. Historically, these ecological impacts have been attributed in part to a focus on survival — but that doesn't mean the issue isn't grave.\n\nDo you think America has a plastic waste problem?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Pollution in the Himalayas endangers access to and consumption of water, as the glaciers feed Asia's biggest rivers, used by over 2 billion people,\" UNESCO stated.\n\nDebris, deforestation, and unnatural stress on footpaths and natural resources have taken a huge toll on the region, with as many as 1,000 people attempting the climb each year.\n\nAccording to National Geographic, each climber produces around 18 pounds of waste, \"and the majority of this waste gets left on the mountain,\" leaving the mess to locals.\n\nSeasoned trekkers emphasize the importance of sustainable expeditions to those considering the journey, but the problem persists, and Reddit users were horrified by the short clip.\n\n\"Genuinely don't get the concept of people littering in nature. If you had the room to bring it, you have the room to take it away,\" one observed.\n\n\"Extremely wealthy people are toxic to society. … These people have never taken out the trash in a day in their lives,\" another remarked, referring to the prohibitive cost of summiting Everest.\n\n\"Humans are a plague.

The same way I watched him swerve lane to lane and he get out the way or him the boy from passing. I feel like the whole thing could have been avoided. On both parties, I feel like they were wrong,\" Parker said.\n\nThe Kingston Police Department said the officer, who has been employed by the Kingston Police since 2022, has been placed on administrative duty until the investigation is concluded.\n\n----------\n* More Northern Suburbs news\n* Send us a news tip\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts \n* \nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

    "description": "XRP price prediction turns critical as momentum improves and large holders step in. One level now decides if the reversal narrative holds.",
    "fullText": "XRP price has rebounded from recent lows, rising nearly 4% from yesterday’s bottom and stabilizing after a modest pullback. While the broader trend remains cautious, a new metric suggests downside momentum may be fading.\n\nWith the XRP issuer recently moving closer to regulated-banking status, the focus now shifts to whether large holders continue to step in to confirm a real trend change.\n\nOn the daily chart, the XRP price has flashed a bullish divergence between December 1 and December 12. During this period, price made a lower low, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formed a higher low. RSI measures momentum, and this pattern often appears when selling pressure weakens before a rebound.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nThis setup has already triggered a bounce, but what makes it more compelling is whale behavior. The two largest XRP holder groups have already started responding.\n\nWallets holding more than 1 billion XRP increased their holdings from 25.36 billion on December 9 to 25.42 billion. At the same time, wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP reversed their selling trend, rising from 8.08 billion on December 11 to 8.15 billion at press time.\n\nIn total, these two cohorts added roughly 130 million XRP. At the current price, that equals about $265 million in net accumulation. This confirms that the biggest holders are not just watching the divergence, they are acting on it.\n\nThe timing also matters. Ripple recently moved closer to securing a US banking license, reinforcing its long-term institutional narrative. That regulatory backdrop gives added weight to whale interest at these levels.\n\nFor the bullish divergence to stay valid, the XRP price needs follow-through. The first level that matters is $2.11. A daily close above it would mark a 3.72% move from current levels and confirm that buyers are regaining short-term control. XRP has not held above $2.11 since early December.\n\nIf that level breaks, the next resistance sits at $2.21. Only a sustained move above $2.21 would shift the structure bullish and reopen the path toward $2.58 or higher.\n\nOn the downside, risk remains clearly defined. If the XRP price falls below $1.96 while RSI weakens, the bullish divergence would be invalidated. That scenario would expose $1.88 first, followed by $1.81 if selling accelerates.\n\nRight now, the setup is constructive but unfinished. Momentum indicators show improvement, and whales have already responded once. For this reversal to fully play out, those large holders need to keep adding support, not just react briefly.\n\nRead original story Largest XRP Whales Are Making a Move – Will Price Respond? by Ananda Banerjee at beincrypto.com",

    "fullText": "A Cybertruck owner in Worcester, Massachusetts, tried to trade in his golden Tesla Cybertruck after he and his family faced constant harassment, but the company refused, Torque News reported.\n\nKumait Jaroje shared on the Tesla Cybertruck Enthusiast Facebook group that he and his family have been regularly harassed for driving it. People would make offensive hand gestures or yell at them — someone even vandalized his truck by putting a Nazi sticker on it. The Nazis, along with their collaborators, murdered six million Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nJaroje said that the harassment was starting to affect his family. His children have become frightened by the hostilities, and his wife now refuses to drive the truck at all. \"My wife and kids don't deserve this,\" he wrote in his Facebook post.\n\nOut of concern for his family, Jaroje tried to trade in his Cybertruck at Tesla, but the company wouldn't accept it.\n\nInstances of harassment like this can hinder the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, which are crucial in reducing people's reliance on dirty energy sources like oil and gas.\n\nThe EPA noted that burning gas and diesel releases heat-trapping gases. EVs can help cut that pollution because they don't produce tailpipe exhaust. Some drivers still hesitate to switch to EVs because of myths about range anxiety, according to U.S. News and World Report, and concerns about the pollution created by battery production.\n\nEven with the mining needed for EV batteries, a researcher from the University of Oxford revealed that the world extracts far more coal, oil, and gas — about 16.5 billion tons per year, compared with roughly 7.7 million tons of minerals mined for low-carbon technology.\n\nHarassment and stigma add barriers for people trying to make cleaner transportation choices. Greater public understanding of the benefits of EVs and how they reduce reliance on dirty energy can help decrease the stigma for early adopters.\n\nCommenters on Jaroje's post sympathized with him. A few fellow Cybertruck owners suggested ignoring the hostilities, but Jaroje said that doing so might make things worse.\n\n\"It is not a 'be cool' sticker. It is someone accusing me of being a Nazi and telling me to buzz off. The truck got scratched many times, and I fixed it without a problem.

    "title": "Hiker shares video of startling encounter deep in forest: 'Fully prepared for a grizzly attack, but not this'",
    "description": "The animal \"swooped out of nowhere.\"",
    "fullText": "A forest hike turned unexpectedly dramatic for TikTok user Taylor Chine (@taylorchine), who recently shared a short clip from a trail in the area of Mount Assiniboine and Banff National Park in Canada. The video shows one hiker — along with the cameraperson — attempting to navigate around a territorial grouse blocking the path.\n\nWhat seems to have begun as a normal trek quickly escalated when the bird \"swooped out of nowhere,\" flapped its wings, and chased the hikers off the narrow forest trail, a moment captured in the footage.\n\nThe caption joked that the hikers were \"fully prepared for a grizzly attack, but not this,\" with feeble attempts at politely asking the bird, addressed as \"sir,\" to please allow them to pass.\n\nChine's TikTok shows the hikers cautiously trying to usher the grouse away from the trail while keeping a respectful distance. Instead, the bird makes the first move, lunging toward them with a flurry of wings.\n\nFor hikers in the Canadian Rockies, this kind of encounter isn't unheard of; grouse can become aggressive or defensive when nesting or when startled by sudden movement. In this case, the bird's swift, bold approach forced the hikers to retreat as it held its ground on the path.\n\nWhile the moment is lighthearted in tone, it also underscores how wildlife behavior can catch off-guard even the most prepared hikers — often those expecting larger or more widely discussed animals that pose a greater threat.\n\nUnusual or heightened wildlife interactions such as this might be partially linked to broader environmental pressures. As human populations grow and outdoor recreation expands deeper into wild spaces, animals are increasingly bumped into closer, and sometimes, tense contact with people.\n\nHabitat loss and shifting food availability driven by rising global temperatures can further intensify these overlaps, pushing wildlife to behave more defensively or wander into areas with high human traffic.\n\nProtecting healthy ecosystems doesn't just benefit animals; it helps keep human-wildlife encounters more predictable and less confrontational. When habitats remain intact and species have adequate resources, animals are more likely to stay dispersed and less likely to guard limited territory aggressively.\n\nNational parks across Canada continue to promote responsible hiking practices, including staying on marked trails, giving wildlife plenty of space, and avoiding sudden movements that can startle animals.\n\nVisitors can help by planning routes carefully, learning the behaviors of local species, and supporting conservation efforts that protect large, connected habitats.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Kent State University is dropping 19 undergraduate degree programs with low enrollment to comply with Ohio's Senate Bill 1.\n\nUnder the law, which became effective in June, state colleges are now required to “eliminate any undergraduate degree program it offers if the institution confers an average of fewer than five degrees in the program annually over any three-year period,\" according to Kent State officials.\n\nOn Dec. 11, Kent State University’s Board of Trustees agreed to eliminate the programs, with this fall being the final admission. All currently enrolled students are receiving individualized advising and teach-out plans to ensure timely degree completion.\n\nThe degree programs being dropped effective fall 2026 include:\n\nThe Africana Studies major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Classics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Community Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe Dance and Dance Studies majors within the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.\n\nThe Earth Science majors within both the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe French major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Horticulture major within the Bachelor of Applied Horticulture degree, and the Horticulture Technology major within the Associate of Applied Science degree.\n\nThe Life Science major and the Life Science/Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe Mathematics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Physical Science major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nThe Physics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Radiologic Technology major within the Associate of Technical Study degree.\n\nThe Respiratory Care major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe School Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nKent State will continue to offer related degrees or credentials in several areas under different program headings, according to university officials. For example, the Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics will sunset, but the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics continues to serve students in that field of study.\n\nFor Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Radiologic Technology, the university will maintain other degree options at the associate or bachelor’s degree level.\n\nFor Africana Studies, Classics, Dance, Earth Science, French and Horticulture, the university will continue to offer undergraduate minors or certificates.\n\nKent State also will maintain teacher education bachelor’s degree programs in science and health fields that align with the inactivated programs.\n\nThe board also approved a strategic partnership with NEOMED Clinical Services LLC to take over Kent State's student health services.\n\nThe board authorized the university to enter into a lease and health center services agreement with NEOMED Clinical Services, establishing a collaborative arrangement to provide comprehensive clinical care and preventive services on campus.\n\nNEOMED occupies about 10,500 square feet of space on the lower floor of the DeWeese Health Center to provide expanded clinical services, health education and outreach programs.\n\nThe three-year agreement begins July 1, 2026, with the option for two one-year renewals. NEOMED will provide all staffing for the health center services and will work cooperatively with Kent State’s Division of People, Culture and Belonging to offer retention to qualified employees.\n\nIn addition, the board approved a Student Health Fee effective fall 2026. Full-time undergraduate and graduate students will be assessed $90 per semester, while part-time students will pay $35 per semester.\n\nThe fee excludes College Credit Plus students, students enrolled in fully online programs, dissertation students and students enrolled at the College of Podiatric Medicine.\n\nIn other business, the board approved a six-year comprehensive capital plan for Fiscal Years 2027-32, identifying campus upgrade projects that are the most important to the institution.\n\nThe plan primarily includes projects funded by state capital appropriations and does not list projects solely financed by local funding or philanthropy.\n\nThe Ohio Office of Budget and Management requires that each state college submit a six-year capital plan.\n\nProjects for the first two years of the plan include:\n\nThe third phase of the renovation of White Hall on the Kent Campus will replace antiquated heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment to the remaining floors along with planned classroom and interior building improvements.\n\nTower renovations in University Library on the Kent Campus.\n\nContinued critical deferred maintenance of the aging infrastructure on the Kent Campus.\n\nInformation technology network access enhancements in academic buildings on the Kent Campus.\n\nThe second phase of Purinton Hall classroom renovations on the East Liverpool Campus.\n\nMain Classroom Building HVAC replacement on the Salem Campus.\n\nThe second phase of central chiller plant replacement on the Stark Campus.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Record-Courier: Kent State will eliminate 19 undergrad programs in fall 2026",

    "description": "The presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nDespite the colossal influence of cryptocurrencies on commerce, computing, and even politics, the true identity of the presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains a mystery in 2025. Making things trickier for identity sleuths, this individual (or perhaps the name represents a group?) disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010, that’s exactly 15 years ago.\n\nThough the last public message from the BTC founder was about technical matters, an email that appears to be from Nakamoto's account was sent to a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast, Mike Hearn, in April 2011. It began with an explanation for absence, of sorts, with the first line reading \"I've moved onto other things.\"\n\nBenjamin Wallace, the author of The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto: A Fifteen-year Quest to Unmask the Secret Genius behind Crypto, wrote earlier this year that the BTC creator’s defining moment was the publication of an article on November 1, 2008.\n\nOn that day, the nine-page-long Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was shared on a little-known crypto mailing list. Its significance: it would solve the double-spending problem, which had cryptographers in knots for decades prior.\n\nIn essence, Nakamoto proposed a public ledger using blockchain that would prevent fraudulent copying and thus double-spending of any digital asset. This peer-to-peer system would be developed and refined by the BTC creator over the following months before their disappearance.\n\nWherever they are or however they live today, the most famous name in crypto history may also be one of the wealthiest entities in the world. Recently cited as the 11th-richest ‘person,’ Nakamoto is thought to still hold the majority of the 1.1 million BTC they mined in the currency’s first year.\n\nToday, that crypto fortune would be worth about $99 billion. However, BTC valuations have recently slid to around $90,000 after several months of oscillation around the $110,000 to $120,000 level.\n\nNakamoto’s BTC fortune has remained unspent since 2010, while its valuation has fluctuated wildly. This incredible level of HODLing has led analysts to believe the BTC creator has either passed away or has tragically lost access to the crypto. Others still believe Nakamoto is intentionally maintaining an absolute silence.\n\nBitcoin has no expiration mechanism, with no timeouts, no inactivity penalties, or other kind of reversion to the network. Moreover, there seems to be no quantum or other new-fangled computer cryptography tech that is anywhere near breaking the SHA-256 algorithm. Thus, these coins may indeed remain inaccessible to anyone other than Nakamoto for the next 20–40 years.\n\nHowever, the situation could change if any of the founders’ coins are ever moved or spent. Such an action would cause a stir in itself. Still, it would also expose the public key of that specific coin, creating a more vulnerable attack surface for a sufficiently powerful future quantum computer.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "Rep. Suhas Subramanyam confirmed that sex acts are depicted, while Rep. Robert Garcia stated that \"some are very disturbing [images] of women and their conditions\"",
    "fullText": "There are photos of \"people engaged in sexual acts\" among the images the House Oversight Committee collected from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, per Rep. Suhas Subramanyam\n\nRep. Robert Garcia echoed that \"some are very disturbing [images] of women and their conditions\"\n\nHouse Democrats released two batches of photos on Dec. 12, with Garcia promising more will come to light\n\nAs House Democrats continue to release photos collected from late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate, a congressman has confirmed that some of the images depict people engaged in sexual acts.\n\nAfter the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee shared a selection of photos from Epstein's estate — more than 95,000 photos have reportedly been collected, in total — on Friday, Dec. 12, Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam confirmed on CNN’s The Arena with Kasie Hunt that some of the unreleased images depict “a lot of people” engaging in sexual acts.\n\nAsked if the committee has pictures of “people engaged in sexual acts” among the collected images, the Democratic congressman told Hunt that “as part of this release, yes, there are pictures of people engaged in sexual acts.”\n\nThe CNN political correspondent also inquired about whether men other than Epstein are shown engaging in these acts, to which Subramanyam answered: “We’re going through that.” The congressman said that lawmakers are “not really quite sure yet who is who,” but added, “Certainly, there are a lot of people involved, though, in some of these acts.”\n\nThe first batch of 19 images show more than 10 prominent men — including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Steve Bannon and the former Prince Andrew — in a variety of settings through the years. The same day as the initial release, House Democrats released 70 more images, which depict different angles of previously released photos from Epstein’s private island, per CNN.\n\nNone of the photographs released so far depict any sexual misconduct or individuals believed to be minors, according to CNN.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHunt also asked Subramanyam about what “disturbing\" — which has been widely used to discuss the Epstein photos, both released and unreleased — means in this context. \"I mean, we’re talking about sexual acts involving, potentially, minors and certainly victims, too, in very suggestive, compromising positions,” the Virginia Democrat said. “Just to leave it at that.”\n\nThe congressman also offered comments on some of the figures depicted in the newly released images. Asked if the Clinton family was given a warning ahead of the release, Subramanyam said: “We are not looking to shield anyone, Democrat or Republican. We are finding the evidence, and we’re putting it out.”\n\n“The only people we’re really consulting with, when it comes to whether or not it’s appropriate to put something out, is victims,” Subramanyam added. (The House Oversight Committee covered the faces of several women in the newly shared photos for privacy reasons.)\n\n“If the Clintons have information, we want to hear it. We welcome them to come testify before a committee, clear their names,” he said, adding that the same is true for Gates, the former Prince Andrew and any others pictured in the photographs.\n\nAdded Subramanyam: “We want to hear from them all about what they know when it came to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.”\n\nCalifornia Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, also addressed the reportedly “disturbing” photos collected from Epstein's estate in a Friday interview.\n\nAppearing on CNN’s The Source with Kaitlan Collins on Dec. 12, Garcia told the host and White House correspondent that some of the images they received from Jeffrey Epstein's estate are \"quite disturbing.\"\n\nHe also told Collins that there are “many, many photos of women” among them. Specifically, he said, \"some are very disturbing of women and their conditions,” per Garcia, who added that lawmakers hope to release the photos in the “days and weeks” to come.\n\nHouse Democrats have vowed to release additional photographs as they continue to pore through the thousands of files they received.",

It’s thought that the fisher was extirpated, or rendered extinct, in Ohio by the mid-1800s. Causes for their extirpation were “unregulated harvest and loss of habitat,” according to the post.\n\nJosh Allen, Hailee Steinfeld announce pregnancy\n\n“This is tremendously exciting, as this is yet another extirpated native Ohio mammal species to be documented for the first time in Cleveland Metroparks. The return of fishers and other extirpated species like otters, bobcats and trumpeter swans are a result of conservation efforts and emphasize the importance of our healthy forests, wetlands, waterways and natural areas in Cleveland Metroparks,” the post said.\n\nFishers are typically found in forested areas with large tree canopies, and use tree cavities as dens, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. The mammals prey on squirrels, mice and birds.",

    "description": "I went Christmas tree shopping with my teens and was stunned by a $370 price tag. It sent me back to my childhood and our tiny cheap recycled tree.",
    "fullText": "It's traditional for our family to go Christmas tree shopping together, even though my kids are now 15 and 17 and practically leading their own lives.\n\nThis year was no exception. We found a brief window between my daughter's clock-in time for her part-time job at a gift store and my son's dentist appointment.\n\nIn previous years, we had invariably bought a tree from a Vermonter who set up camp in the parking lot of our local church.\n\nWhen we lived in New York City before our children arrived, my husband and I would buy one from a friendly sidewalk vendor with a truck full of fir trees.\n\nThere was something magical about picking it out, throwing it over your shoulder, and bringing it up to your apartment, despite the pine needles that dropped in the elevator.\n\nStill, as an immigrant from the UK, where people literally drag them home or transport them in the back of their vehicle, I still get a kick from seeing cars on the road with a tree strapped to the roof.\n\nThe guy from Vermont had failed to make the journey to our suburb for some reason this year. We chose to visit a nursery based on a friend's recommendation.\n\nIt was packed, but there were scores of trees remaining tethered to poles.\n\nSince it's my daughter's last Christmas before she heads off to college, we decided to make it extra special by getting a taller tree than usual.\n\nShe got first dibs on choosing, and after browsing the 9-foot and 10-foot sections, settled on the third one she saw.\n\nI strolled off to look at some garlands, only to see my husband frantically waving his arms at me. \"Get back in the car,\" he mouthed, not wanting anyone to hear.\n\nIt turned out the tree that our daughter selected cost $370 — the equivalent of $37 a foot. I gasped in shock. I knew we lived in one of the most expensive counties in New York — if not the US — but the price was off the charts.\n\nThere was no way I was going to pay close to $400 for something that would grace our living room for less than a month. Even the kids acknowledged that it wasn't worth the cash.\n\nThe experience prompted me to reflect on my childhood in northeast England during the 1970s. A distant memory stirred in my mind.\n\nI recalled how, several Decembers in a row, my dad dug up a 4-foot fir— for some reason nicknamed George — which was growing in our front garden.\n\nGeorge was so small and sparse, he could have belonged to Charlie Brown. But he'd replant him in a pot, and my sister, Alison, and I would decorate him with lights, tinsel, and ornaments.\n\nThen, at the beginning of January, Dad would put him back in the ground until the end of that year. I suppose we were a green family, long before it became a thing.\n\nGeorge was unearthed one year too many and then died. It was a sad day. We had always been thrilled to watch George enter and exit the house every Christmas.\n\nAfter the sticker shock over the $370 tree, I considered telling my kids that we would plant another George. But we ended up buying another 10-footer for just over $200 from a roadside stand.\n\nI mentioned our search for a more affordable tree to Ali. We reminisced about George. Two days later, she sent me a black-and-white photo from 1976 over WhatsApp.\n\nShe'd found a picture of 8-year-old me standing in our yard next to George. My mom had kept it at the bottom of a drawer all these years.",

    "description": "I never thought I'd plan my dad's funeral so soon. His death showed me why preparing for the inevitable brings comfort, not fear.",
    "fullText": "Sitting across from the funeral director, I held my husband's hand. I needed to feel something real while my body moved between sadness and shock. I glanced at my mom to steady her and at my husband for support. There was one person noticeably missing from our group: my dad.\n\nThe day before, I wouldn't have guessed I'd be spending my afternoon at a funeral home. I had talked to my dad that night and made plans for our weekly dinner. When I hung up the phone, I had no clue that was the last time I'd speak to him. There was no inner hunch that doom was on the horizon, and nothing that said he wasn't feeling well. So, the next morning, when the ER doctor told my mom, husband, and me that they tried to revive him and failed — I didn't know how to process the information. Dying of a heart attack made no sense. I thought we had plenty of time.\n\nThroughout my life, we had relied on him to answer the hard questions, and we desperately needed him now. It had only been three hours since his unexpected passing, and here we were planning his funeral. I had no idea what he wanted.\n\nI recall sitting at my parents' dinner table with my then-9-year-old son. He drank his milk while my dad gestured to the desk behind him. The white stack of papers (the size of a small novel) stood out against the stack of magazines. \"Do you want to read my will?\" my dad asked with a wink.\n\nNot really what I'd call an uplifting dinnertime read. At 71 years young, he was active and in good shape — a recent retiree ready to travel and spend time with his grandkids. I didn't want to think about his potential decline — my dad was invincible.\n\nHe never caught the colds and stomach flus I brought home from school. He rarely missed work, and I figured I wouldn't have to deal with this anytime soon. My grandparents lived well into their 80s — my great-grandmother until 100. I did the quick math — that was at least another 10 years or more.\n\nI politely declined the read, telling him there'd be plenty of time to cover that another day. \"That's all right,\" he began with a smirk,\" I fell asleep when I tried to proofread it.\" And that was that. There was no talk of caskets or whether he preferred The Beatles or the Rolling Stones to be played at his funeral.\n\nNo reason to discuss his death when he was so full of life. That night, we finished our hamburgers, and his will stayed on the desk, gathering dust, for the next year. And then time ran out.\n\nThis memory ran through my mind as I tried to answer the questions the funeral director asked. It was hard to concentrate with this huge lump in my stomach. Mostly, I wanted to cry and run away. Even hiding under the covers right now sounded like a good option.\n\nI concentrated on the warmth of my husband's hand and answered some basic questions, such as where my dad was born and his age. I failed when asked for his Social Security number. My mom tried to take over, but she was so distressed that her answers were slow and hard to access. I wanted to talk to my dad. I wish I had. This would be so much easier.\n\nLooking at my husband, I immediately thought about my son sitting in a similar seat for us. My shoulders tensed. My tears started again, but this time because I imagined an older version of my kid stumbling through unknown answers with no space to feel his feelings. I did not want this overwhelming ordeal for him. If I could make it easier or eliminate this step completely, I would.\n\nLater that night, when my husband and I had a quiet moment alone, I told him I wanted to write out our death details for our son. He looked surprised and whispered, \"We have plenty of time.\" I'm sure that was meant to reassure me, but it was exactly what I said to my dad not that long ago. My mom heart would do anything to protect our son's space to grieve. I wanted cozy childhood memories to comfort him when one of us couldn't — not images of his mom or dad in a casket.\n\nA few weeks later, as I processed my dad's passing, my husband and I talked about our own. We created a checklist of what we wanted, including which funeral home and cemetery to contact. My husband and I added doodles and love notes to the list and made sure our will was in order, too. Instead of freaking my 9-year-old with more morbid information, we told trusted family members where to find all the papers. Fingers crossed, it will sit in my desk drawer gathering dust for many more years to come.",

    "fullText": "If Elon Musk and Sam Altman like each other, they hide it well.\n\nIn the latest turn in the rivalry, the two are battling over the top spot on the list of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nWhile the two cofounded OpenAI together back in 2015, the partnership has frayed spectacularly since.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018 and later founded rival startup, xAI. Musk or his company, xAI, has filed lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI held a secondary share sale in October that valued it at $500 billion, taking the lead from Musk's SpaceX by a cool $100 billion.\n\nNot one to cede ground to a rival, Musk is now planning his own secondary share sale at SpaceX, according to an internal letter to employees seen by multiple outlets. It would value the company at a whopping $800 billion. If that happens soon, it means Musk would have only let Altman hold the mantle for a couple of months.\n\nMusk also confirmed on X this week that the company is exploring a blockbuster initial public offering, which might be the only way OpenAI can regain its lead as a private company. OpenAI this year restructured its business, which would allow it to also pursue its own eye-watering IPO in the future.\n\nWhile this valuation battle between the two billionaires is maybe cringeworthy theater for the average earner, it underscores a significant shift: investors are pouring unprecedented money into technologies once viewed as speculative science projects.\n\nSpaceX, which aims to make life multi-planetary and colonize Mars, and OpenAI, which seeks to develop a theoretical AI that can reason like humans, are two of the most visible examples, but they are part of a broader surge in frontier-tech valuations. AI, robotics, and defense tech startups have all notched multibillion-dollar valuations in the past year — bubble be damned.",

    "description": "Companies like Meta are offering huge pay packages for top AI talent. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, however, says he isn't giving in to the pressure.",
    "fullText": "The talent wars continue to rage across Silicon Valley as companies vie for the best and brightest minds in AI. There is, however, one major AI company that says it is not giving in to pressure.\n\nMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said on Bloomberg Podcasts that he doesn't plan to compete with tech giants like Meta by offering top dollar for talent.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's matching those things,\" Suleyman said of the $100 million signing bonuses Meta has been offering engineers, and the $250 million packages it's been using to lure top AI researchers.\n\n\"I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team, and I don't really think that's the right approach,\" he said.\n\nSuleyman said he was \"very selective\" about new hires when he previously worked at DeepMind. At Microsoft, he said he has hired \"incrementally,\" prioritizing candidates who aligned with the team's culture and had the right skills, and let go of those who did not.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the top ranks of AI talent are commanding pay packages in the millions.\n\nIn June, Meta spent $14.3 billion on an investment in Scale AI — a deal widely seen as an acquihire of its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Google also made a similar move, acquiring the leaders of Windsurf, an AI coding platform. in a deal worth $2.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that Meta tried to lure his employees away with $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said OpenAI later offered to match.\n\nEven at smaller startups, someone in an AI leadership role can command between $300,000 and $400,000 in base pay, Shawn Thorne, managing director at executive search firm True Search, previously told Business Insider.\n\nSuleyman said \"rotation\" is part of the industry, given the small pool of talent. He cited Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI, Amar Subramanya, decamping to Apple earlier this month as an example.\n\nMicrosoft recently brought in several new hires from DeepMind and OpenAI, he said.\n\n\"There's certainly no 'no poach' agreements, that would not be legal,\" he added. \"People can go work for whoever they want to work for.\"",

    "title": "My 3 kids all need very different parenting styles from me. Being fair doesn't mean being the same.",
    "description": "A one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work for parenting. Over 20 years, I've learned my kids all respond to different styles.",
    "fullText": "For years, the soundtrack of my household has included some version of: \"But why doesn't she have to do that?\" or \"You never punish him!\" Every time I heard it, I'd get that familiar pang of mother guilt.\n\nHad I gotten lazy? Did I care less about what one did over the other? Was I a terrible parent for being too strict with one and not strict enough with another? Did I, in fact, have a favorite child?\n\nNow, nearly 21 years and three kids into motherhood, I finally understand that while yes, I was slightly less anxious as each kid joined our family, it wasn't so much that my parenting style was changing. It was that each of my kids needed to be parented differently, and I had been doing it all along without even realizing it.\n\nMy oldest made this realization the easiest. He genuinely values my advice and still calls me from college to ask for my thoughts on something before he makes a decision. He shares his fears, anxieties, and illness symptoms with me on the regular. But once we talk it through, he almost always goes off and figures things out for himself. With him, parenting is often about stepping back. He wants a sounding board, not a manager, and knowing he'll take the baton and run reassures me that with him, my job is to guide, not direct.\n\nMy middle child is the opposite. Being her parent activates a very specific reflex in me — the instinct to swoop in and take care of it all. She's the kid I want to protect from anything uncomfortable, the one I have to force myself to let wobble so she can learn to balance. She is smart, capable, and resourceful, but she processes her uncertainty through emotion and anxiety, and when I sense her panic, my impulse is to jump in and fix it. The hardest thing I've had to learn is that helping my daughter means not doing things for her but offering solutions while giving her the tools to manage them for herself.\n\nAnd then there's my youngest, who behaves as if he's been fiercely independent since birth. He likes to wave off my involvement and gets irritated if I so much as offer to set an alarm to wake him for school, ask if he's done his homework, or attempt to do his laundry for him. He doesn't want to be micromanaged, but likes to know that I am always close by, waiting quietly in the wings for those moments when it's all just too much, and he wants me to step in. With him, there's less heavy lifting and more just being there to catch him when he's falling.\n\nFor so long, I assumed parenting was something that should feel uniform, a philosophy you carry from one child to the next, maybe tweaking for age but not for temperament. All the while, I was unintentionally adjusting my parenting for each kid, while beating myself up for treating them differently. At some point, I internalized (or let my kids convince me) that \"fair\" meant \"the same.\" But the older my kids get, the clearer it becomes that what one kid experiences as support, another might experience as pressure. What one sees as freedom, another might interpret as abandonment.\n\nAnd while the soundtrack remains the same: \"She's your favorite!\" \"Why do you let him get away with that?!\" I stopped asking myself whether I was getting too lenient or too strict. I started asking a better question: What does this child need from me right now — not what did their sibling need at this age, not what I think I'm supposed to do, or how their sibling wishes I would handle it, but what actually helps this particular kid thrive. I no longer measure my consistency by how similarly I treat my kids, but by how attuned I am to each of them as individuals.\n\nIn the end, the thing my children have taught me, each in their own way, is that my job isn't to parent them the same way three times. It's to parent three different children in ways that help them become who they're meant to be based on who they are now.",

    "title": "Dick Van Dyke is 100 years old. Here are his 3 tips for living a long life.",
    "description": "Dick Van Dyke , who celebrated his 100th on Saturday,  hasn't shied away from sharing his advice for a long, healthy life.",
    "fullText": "Dick Van Dyke, the larger-than-life comedian, is now a centenarian.\n\nVan Dyke celebrated his 100th birthday on Saturday, marking a new chapter in his already storied life and career.\n\nHe became a household name in the 1960s while starring on the CBS sitcom, \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which won 15 Emmys and two Golden Globes. Van Dyke's star rose even higher when he headlined \"Mary Poppins\" alongside Julie Andrews in 1964 and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" with Sally Ann Howes in 1968.\n\nIn addition to an extensive filmography, Van Dyke also won a Tony Award in 1961 for his role as Albert Peterson in \"Bye Bye Birdie.\"\n\nAs Van Dyke grew older, he has often shared insights and advice on living a long life. Here are three tips Van Dyke follows.\n\nDuring an appearance on actor Ted Danson's podcast, \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name,\" in January, Van Dyke said he exercises several times a week.\n\n\"I've always exercised,\" Van Dyke said. \"Three days a week, we go to the gym. I think that's why I'm not stove-up like my equals.\"\n\nDanson recalled seeing Van Dyke at the gym and being impressed by his routine.\n\n\"I would go to the same gym you did, and if I got there early enough, I would see you, literally, work out on some weight machine,\" Danson said. \"And then, almost like you were doing circuit training, you would not walk to the next machine, you'd dance. You literally danced to the next machine.\"\n\nDanson said he later asked Van Dyke about his workout routine.\n\n\"You said you would come to the gym and work out for whatever hour, whatever it is, then you would go home. You would swim laps and then get back into bed and take a nap.\"\n\nVan Dyke said these days, he's doing a lot of stretching and yoga.\n\nIn his new book, \"100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life,\" Van Dyke wrote that his short-term memory is \"shot,\" but he still has \"his marbles.\"\n\n\"I used to do the crossword religiously for years (in pen), and now it's 'Jeopardy!' that keeps me sharp, though Arlene always has the answer before I do,\" Van Dyke wrote, referring to his wife, Arlene Silver.\n\nVan Dyke and Silver, 54, tied the knot in 2012. In his book, Van Dyke wrote that his job as an entertainer required him to have a good memory.\n\n\"For my whole career, I had to memorize pages and pages of lines and a ton of songs, backward and forward, so I was able to say or sing them without even thinking,\" he wrote. \"When I sing with The Vantastix, it's often songs from shows and movies I've done, and those are right at the front of my brain.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can still pick up new material easily, too, though it might take three or four more run-throughs than it used to be before the lyrics feel like second nature.\"\n\nVan Dyke also wrote that cutting alcohol out of his diet likely played a part in his good brain health.\n\nIn his book, Van Dyke recalled his former roles, including a series of old men, like Mr. Dawes Sr. in \"Mary Poppins.\"\n\n\"I'm not playing super-old anymore. I am super old. Speaking now from this position of centenarian authenticity, I can look back on my old man roles and say that some stuff I got right,\" he wrote.\n\nVan Dyke wrote that it's \"frustrating to feel diminished in the world, physically and socially,\" in addition to navigating the uncertainty of current global events.\n\nHowever, Van Dyke said keeping a positive outlook on life is key.\n\n\"I've made it to one hundred, in no small part, because I have stubbornly refused to give in to the bad stuff in life: failure and defeats, personal losses, loneliness and bitterness, the physical and emotional pains of aging. Because, as I see it, to do that would be to throw in the towel on life itself.\"\n\nInstead, Van Dyke said, \"for the vast majority of my years, I have been in what I can only describe as a full-on bear hug with the experience of living. Being alive has been doing life — not like a job, but rather like a giant playground.\"",

Jalibert conducted a devastating counter attack, linking up with France team-mates Damian Penaud and Louis Bielle-Biarrey.\n\nScarlets kept in the fight and the forwards showed great patience with Thomas eventually squeezing over.\n\nAnd while they looked to consolidate, Bordeaux managed one more before the break with Jalibert offloading to Tiaan Jacobs who rode the tackle before stretching for the line.\n\nScarlets defended heroically in the second-half as both sides introduced their benches early.\n\nAnd it took almost 20 minutes for Bordeaux to find a breakthrough after Sam Costelow held up an effort from a charging Temo Matiu.\n\nScarlets were reduced to 14 players with Jarrod Taylor's sin-binning and the damage was almost instant with Pablo Uberti one of several players queuing up to score out wide.\n\nStill a man down, Scarlets found their third try of the evening and it was another close-range effort from Anderson who is proving a valuable signing from Crusaders.\n\nBut slim hopes of a comeback took a significant blow as some tired defence saw Xan Mousques power over, with his effort quickly followed by a break away from Bielle-Biarrey, with Joey Carbery's conversion taking Bordeaux's score to half a century.\n\nScarlets desperately chased a try bonus-point in the dying minutes, but the defensive effort had taken its toll.\n\nBordeaux-Begles fly-half Joey Carbery said:\n\n\"Thankfully we got the result, especially after going away to Bulls last week.\n\n\"Training and playing [with players like Jalibert] you get to see how special they are. It's a privilege to be out here.\n\n\"To win in Europe is tough, especially at home we have to win these games, and I'm just thankful we have done that.\"\n\nScarlets head coach Dwayne Peel said:\n\n\"It is obviously disappointing that we didn't get anything out of the game, we were fighting hard for that fourth try at the end.\n\n\"I can't fault the effort of the boys, it was just our inaccuracies that hurt us out there, you can't allow a side of the quality of Bordeaux easy ins and I felt we did that at times.\n\n\"Our forwards carried strongly, I thought Fletcher Anderson at eight was excellent, he has been a really good signing for us.\n\n\"When we were in their 22 we took our tries well, it was just frustrating that the game got away through our inaccuracies.\"\n\nBoth sides return to festive league action before playing their final two Pool 4 games in January.\n\nBordeaux face Northampton Saints on Saturday, 10 January (15:15 GMT) and Scarlets welcome Pau in the day's later kick-off (20:00 GMT).\n\nEight days later Bordeaux are at Bristol Bears (13:00 GMT), while Scarlets travel to Northampton Saints (15:15 GMT).\n\nBordeaux-Begles: Mousques; Penaud, Uberti, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Page-Relo: Poirot (capt), Barlot, Falatea, Palu, Coleman, Jacobs, Vergnes-Taillefer, Matiu.\n\nReplacements: Everitt, Perchaud, B Tameifuna, J Gray, Gardrat, Retiere, Carbery, R Janse van Rensburg.\n\nScarlets: J Davies; Lewis, Roberts, James, Mee; Hawkins, Blacker; Hepburn, Van der Merwe, Thomas, Douglas, Ball, Macleod (capt), Davis, Anderson.\n\nReplacements: Elias, Mathias, H O'Connor, Lousi, J Taylor, A Hughes, Costelow, Page.\n\nReferee: Morne Ferreira (South Africa)\n\nAssistants: Griffin Colby & Christopher Allison (South Africa)\n\nTMO: Marius van der Westhuizen (South Africa).",

    "fullText": "Tries: Nott, Bowen, Southworth, D Thomas Cons: Halfpenny, Sheedy 2 Pen: Sheedy\n\nTries: Stewart, Hume, Kok 2 Cons: Flannery 3\n\nCardiff fly-half Callum Sheedy kicked a last-gasp winning penalty to defeat Ulster in a Challenge Cup thriller at the Arms Park.\n\nSheedy's nerveless effort completed a remarkable Cardiff comeback from 26-12 down and ensured Leigh Halfpenny's homecoming ended in a dramatic victory.\n\nCardiff had raced into a 12-0 lead through tries from lock George Nott and teenage wing Tom Bowen.\n\nUlster rallied with tries from captain Tom Stewart, centre James Hume and a double from wing Werner Kok to give the visitors a 14-point lead after 65 minutes.\n\nCardiff responded with tries from replacement prop Danny Southworth and flanker Dan Thomas, before Sheedy stepped up with the final kick of the game.\n\nYou can not blame players for leaving - Hook\n\nGloucester's Llewellyn out until 'latter part' of season\n\nEtzebeth explains eye gouge 'mistake' on Wales' Mann\n\nRichie Murphy's side had started their European campaign with a thumping 61-7 win over Racing 92.\n\nIn contrast, Cardiff suffered a 38-17 away defeat against Stade Francais.\n\nBoth sides rung the changes with Ulster making eight alterations as the likes of Jacob Stockdale, Rob Baloucoune, Jude Postlethwaite, Jack Murphy, Nathan Doak, Rob Herring and Nick Timoney were rested.\n\nOnly captain Alun Lawrence, flanker James Botham, prop Rhys Barratt and lock Thornton survived in the Cardiff starting side from the Paris trip.\n\nCentre Ben Thomas, prop Keiron Assiratti and lock Rory Thornton all made their 100th Cardiff appearance and led the team out with their children.\n\nHalfpenny, who will celebrate his 37rd birthday later this month, was making his first Cardiff appearance in 4,347 days since he left for Toulon in 2014.\n\nAfter playing spells with Scarlets, Crusaders and Harlequins and a coaching stint with Wales in the summer in Japan, Halfpenny has returned to the Arms Park 11 years later in a playing-coach role.\n\nDespite all the milestones and comebacks, it was Nott who opened the scoring after a clever tip pass from fellow lock Thornton.\n\nBowen, who was only three when Halfpenny made his first Cardiff debut in 2008, scored a superb solo try when he collected his own grubber kick and outpaced Werner Kok.\n\nThe controversial score was given following a discussion between the referee and television match official (TMO) with the ball looked to have gone forward in the build-up off Halfpenny's chest.\n\nThe French officials decided there was no further touch from Halfpenny's hand so the score stood.\n\nUlster responded when Stewart marked his first game as captain by scoring a try from a rolling maul.\n\nAssiratti was forced off the field just before half-time before Bowen, still just 19, demonstrated both sides of his game and showed why many are tipping him for Wales senior honours soon.\n\nAfter his try-saving tackle denied Stewart a second score following a free-flowing move, Bowen's burst down the right almost led to a third Cardiff try.\n\nInstead, Ulster weathered the pressure and Hume capitalised on a Sheedy handling mistake to sprint 50 metres to score.\n\nFlannery's conversion gave Ulster a 14-12 half-time lead which the visitors extended early in the second half following a well-worked try that was finished by Kok.\n\nAfter extending the lead, Ulster were able to bring on imposing the forward trio of Angus Bell, Cormac Izuchukwu and Juarno Augustus.\n\nThe visitors' dominance continued with Kok scoring his second in the right hand corner.\n\nHalfpenny was replaced after 57 minutes by Cameron Winnett before tempers flared, with Ulster unhappy with a James Botham challenge on Zac Ward.\n\nLock Harry Sheridan and Botham clashed with both players sent to the sin-bin before Ulster were down to 13 men when the centre was shown a yellow card for a deliberate knock-on.\n\nCardiff made their extra man tell when flanker Thomas was driven over with Sheedy's conversion levelling the scores with six minutes to play.\n\nA surging home scrum then forced a penalty to give Sheedy the platform to win the match.\n\nHis goal-kicking has come under scrutiny since he arrived at Cardiff from Bristol but on this occasion the Wales fly-half demonstrated his class to clinch victory.\n\nBoth sides will return to the United Rugby Championship (URC) next weekend where Cardiff are second and Ulster fourth, with both sides only losing one league games this season.\n\nIt is the Welsh derby season for Cardiff in the Christmas and New Year period as they host Scarlets on Friday, 19 December before welcoming Dragons seven days later, with a trip to play Ospreys in Bridgend on 1 January.\n\nUlster travel to face Leinster on Friday, 19 January before they face a trip to play Connacht eight days later. They will then host Munster on Friday, 2 January.\n\nCardiff: Halfpenny; Adams, Millard, B Thomas, Bowen; Sheedy, A Davies; Barratt, D Hughes, Assiratti, Nott, Thornton, Botham, D Thomas, Lawrence (capt).\n\nReplacements: E Lloyd, Southworth, Wainwright, McNally, De la Rua, Bevan, Beetham, Winnett.\n\nUlster: S Moore; Kok, Hume, Carson, Ward; Flannery, McKee; Crean, Steward (capt), O'Toole, Sheridan, Irvine, McCann, Reffell, Ward.\n\nReplacements: Andrew, Bell, McGuire, Izuchukwu, Augustus, Shanahan, Humphreys, McNamara,\n\nSin-bin: Sheridan 68, Carson 72.\n\nReferee: Evan Urruzmendi (France)\n\nAssistant referees: Pierre-Baptiste Nuchy (France), Anthony Lac (Monaco)",

This tournament is the Super Bowl of darts so I would say this is a good moment.\"\n\nLim will face Luke Humphries in the second round after the 2024 world champion progressed with a 3-1 win over Ted Evetts in his opening match later on Saturday evening.\n\nHumphries had cruised into a 2-0 lead against his fellow Englishman before Evetts pinched a set back.\n\nHowever, 30-year-old Humphries regained his intensity and clinically finished out the contest with an average of 98.58, throwing eight 180s.\n\nLim, who thew the first world championship nine-darter at the BDO event at Lakeside in 1990, beat Humphries when the pair last met at the Ally Pally five years ago.\n\nOn meeting again, Humphries told Sky Sports: \"He's amazing, he's a legend. The crowd are going to be against me so it's going to be a tough game.\"\n\nLim said: \"I hope on a given day it can happen again. I never give up.

In general,\" before clarifying when asked if it was aimed at fans or the media: \"I love the fans and we are very happy with the fans.\"\n\nMaresca also highlighted Chelsea's injury and suspension issues, pointing out they had been without star attacker Cole Palmer for much of the season, as well as losing key midfielder Moises Caicedo to a three-match ban and striker Liam Delap to two significant injuries.\n\n\"I really praise the players and the squad because we played 16 Premier League games, five of them without Moises Caicedo, 11 of them without Cole Palmer, almost all of them without Liam Delap,\" he said.\n\n\"And this squad, no matter who is playing, they are doing fantastic. Today was five games in 12 days so for sure when you see Cole Palmer there, we said many times that he's our best player but we play almost all season without our best player.\n\n\"We play five games in the Premier League without Moises Caicedo. This is the reason why I'm so happy for the players and it's something that I would like people outside to appreciate because the effort from the players is fantastic.\"\n\nChelsea's victory over Everton consolidated their position in fourth in the Premier League table, with a Carabao Cup quarter-final at Cardiff and a league trip to Newcastle to come next week.",

    "fullText": "Tries: McKay, Brown, Tuipulotu Cons: Hastings 4\n\nTries: Dupont, Gourgues 2, Cons: Ramos 3\n\nGlasgow Warriors mounted an epic comeback from 21-0 down to beat French giants Toulouse in the Champions Cup on one of the club's greatest nights.\n\nIn torrential rain and gale-force winds, the six-time champions were still able to display all their signature power and precision in the first half as they threatened to comprehensively outclass their hosts.\n\nAntoine Dupont, making his first start in eight months after a serious knee injury, got the ball rolling with the opening try and a double from Kalvin Gourgues saw the visitors race into what looked like an unassailable lead at half-time.\n\nWarriors re-emerged like a team possessed and stunned Toulouse with tries from Josh McKay, Gregor Brown, Sione Tuipulotu and Gregor Hiddleston to send Scotstoun into raptures.\n\nA big cheer went up when Dupont's name was read out by the stadium announcer ahead of the match, and the little maestro wasted no time in showing his class.\n\nThibaud Flament burst through the Warriors defence and galloped into the 22, finding Dupont on his shoulder and he glided over for the opening try in a little over six minutes.\n\nDupont was instrumental as Toulouse struck again moments later, though the home crowd were furious as they were convinced his pass to send Gourgeus over for the second try was forward.\n\nWarriors seemed to be on referee Matthew Carley's bad side, with the penalty count and the pressure cranking up against them.\n\nThe home side were grimly hanging on for half-time, but Gourgeus shrugged off a weak tackle from Josh McKay to go over for his second and Toulouse's third.\n\nGlasgow survived another scare in the final play of the half when Ange Capuozzo's try was ruled out after he was just bundled into touch as he grounded in the corner, but at 21-0 at the break, the contest was all but done.\n\nOr was it? Glasgow needed something to offer a glimmer of hope and they got it when some slick handling set McKay free up the touchline to run in for the try.\n\nWhether it was some strong words at half-time from head coach Franco Smith, or turning around to play with the wind now at their backs, a flick had switched and suddenly Warriors were putting it up to their illustrious opponents.\n\nThe Glasgow bench was making an impact and one of the substitutes, Brown, blasted over from close range to reduce the arrears to seven points and bring Scotstoun to life.\n\nThe roof nearly came off the place when Tuipulotu finished off an a period of intense pressure on the Toulouse line, and when Adam Hastings banged over the conversion we were all square.\n\nStill Glasgow came. They had Toulouse rocking and they landed another blow, a rolling line-out maul thundering over the try-line with substitute Hiddleston touching down to give Warriors the lead for the first time.\n\nThe great teams often find their way out a hole, but on this particular night, the Toulouse Galacticos had the fight knocked out of them by an inspired Glasgow Warriors side on a beautifully bonkers evening at Scotstoun that will live long in the memory.\n\nGlasgow: McKay; Steyn, McDowall, Tuipulotu, Smith; Hastings, Dobie; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, M Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Horne, Lancaster.\n\nToulouse: Ramos; Capuozzo, Costes, Gourgues, Kinghorn; Ntamack, Dupont; Ainuu, Marchand, Aldegheri, Brennan, Flament, Willis, Banos, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Lacombre, Neti, Merkler, Meafou, Castro Ferreira, Roumat, Graou, Thomas.",

Only for now, it seems.\n\nSalah will join Egypt in Cairo over the coming days as they prepare for the Africa Cup of Nations - but the message after manager Arne Slot's post-match news conference was clear.\n\nA line has been drawn when it comes to team selection.\n\n\"There is no issue for me to resolve,\" said Slot. \"For me, he is now the same as any other player. There is nothing for me to talk about after what happened against Leeds.\"\n\nIn his outburst at Elland Road last Saturday - where he claimed to have been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and had no relationship with his Dutch boss - Salah said this game against Brighton could well be his farewell.\n\nHaving been left out of the squad for the midweek Champions League win at Inter Milan, he came off the bench against the Seagulls as a 26th-minute replacement for the injured Joe Gomez.\n\nAnd the expectation now is very much that the 33-year-old will return to Liverpool next month after international duty.\n\nTalks are still planned between both parties while Salah is away but, a week on from his emotional interview at Leeds, he was all smiles in the mixed zone at Anfield as he walked past the media and was asked for a chat.\n\n\"Two weeks in a row? No, no,\" joked Salah.",
