    "description": "Alabama basketball couldn't compete on the glass against No. 1 ranked Arizona Saturday, lost in a rout, and Jimi Hendrix summed it up well.",
    "fullText": "BIRMINGHAM — The Jimi Hendrix rendition of \"All Along the Watchtower\" blasted loudly through Legacy Arena as the Alabama basketball team walked off the floor as losers of a blowout, summed up perfectly how the Crimson Tide must have been feeling.\n\nThere must be some way out of here, said the joker to the thief.\n\nThere’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief.\n\nAlabama was looking for a way out of the building as fast as possible, but have no confusion about this: Rebounding was the reason. Arizona 96, Alabama 75.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: Alabama basketball vs Arizona live updates, highlights from C.M. Newton Classic\n\nPushing the Crimson Tide (7-3) around under the basket is the book being written by opponents on this Nate Oats team, and it's not a first edition. It's been UA's undoing more often than not when things don't go well in the Oats era; the Wildcats — ranked No. 1 in the nation — were just the latest to expose it on Saturday night.\n\nArizona dominated the boards 52-32.\n\nThe neutral floor, of course, didn't sound neutral at all. A lively pro-Alabama crowd roared for about a half, until the top team in America started playing like it. By the end of a 28-6 Arizona run that took roughly nine minutes off the second-half clock, the outcome had been decided, fans at the BJCC were sitting on their hands, and the Crimson Tide's rebounders might as well have been doing the same.\n\nOf course, that 28-6 hammer, during which Oats stubbornly declined to call a timeout, was punctuated by more than just rebounding problems. The shooting went cold, the defense lapsed, and lest anyone forget, a Final-Four threat of an Arizona team just played some really good basketball. But nothing exposed where the Crimson Tide needs to improve more than the rebounding disparity. Arizona piled up 22 offensive rebounds to Alabama's three. That translated into 28 more field goal attempts for the Wildcats, which Oats lamented as the determining factor.\n\nIn one maddening sequence in the second half, Crimson Tide center Aiden Sherrell and forward Amari Allen blocked two shots in four seconds, but gave up five offensive rebounds on the same possession, ultimately yielding a layup for a 55-48 Arizona lead. Alabama's defense recorded a whopping 15 blocks, led by Sherrell's eight, but allowed far too many second and third shots to have a chance at upending the Wildcats.\n\nBeating Alabama up under the glass might be the right song for opponents, but only a few of them can sing it. The Crimson Tide's three losses have come at the hands of the nation's No. 1, No. 5 and No. 12 teams, but the same problem cropped up in all of them.\n\n\"This has been a recurring issue with us,\" Oats said. \"Purdue, I think we lost (in rebounding) by 24. Gonzaga beat us. When we've played these tough, physical teams, we haven't answered the bell real well on the glass.\"\n\nSEC play is three weeks away for Oats, and when it comes to rebounding woes, he must find a way out.\n\nTuscaloosa News columnist Chase Goodbread is also the weekly co-host of Crimson Cover TV on WVUA-23.

    "fullText": "Victor Wembanyama made a triumphant return from injury to lead the San Antonio Spurs to a stunning NBA Cup semi-final upset of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday as the New York Knicks downed the Orlando Magic to book their place in the final.\n\nFrench prodigy Wembanyama, who has missed the Spurs' last 12 games after suffering a left calf strain last month, produced a dominant performance at both ends of the court to set up a thrilling 111-109 victory at Las Vegas's T-Mobile Arena.\n\nThe 7ft 4in (2.24m) 21-year-old finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in 21 minutes on court, helping the Spurs climb out of a 16-point hole in the second quarter to inflict only the second Oklahoma City defeat this season.\n\nNBA champions Oklahoma City had gone into the game on the back of a 16-game winning streak, boasting a 24-1 record for the season that had prompted talk of them breaking Golden State's record 73-win season.\n\nBut after making a smooth start to control the game, Wembanyama began to make his presence felt off the bench in the second quarter to breathe new life into the San Antonio ranks.\n\n\"I knew I had limited minutes so I had to make the most out of it,\" Wembanyama said.\n\n\"Winning against a team like this, it might seem like it's just a game but it's a collective effort and it's not an easy thing.\n\n\"It's only their second loss of the season. It means something.\"\n\nWembanyama was one of four San Antonio players to finish with double figures, with Devin Vassell scoring 23, and Stephon Castle and De'Aaron Fox adding 22 apiece.\n\n\"It says a lot. And it says a lot about where this team is going to be in the future,\" he said.\n\nReigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder scoring with 29 points, while Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren added 17 points each.\n\nIn Saturday's other semi-final, Jalen Brunson scored 40 points to power the New York Knicks to their first NBA Cup final with a 132-120 win over the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe Knicks' in-form offense proved too hot for injury-hit Orlando as New York took their recent streak to nine wins from 10 games.\n\n\"We came out here and did exactly what we said we wanted to do, which was play Knicks basketball,\" said Karl-Anthony Towns, who backed Brunson with 29 points.\n\nThe Magic had led 36-33 after making a rapid start to a breathless opening quarter -- earning the Knicks players some harsh and fiery words from coach Mike Brown in an early timeout.\n\n\"The way they came out, physicality-wise, we weren't ready for it,\" said Brunson.\n\n\"We bounced back and responded to that, and the way we played the rest of the game is a testament to that first timeout.\"\n\nNew York went on a tear at the start of the second quarter, capitalizing on a missed floating jump shot from Desmond Bane to take the lead through Josh Hart.\n\nThe Knicks briefly relinquished their advantage soon after half-time, when Bane put the Magic back ahead with a running layup.\n\nBut Orlando ultimately could not keep pace with Brunson, who late in the third quarter left opposing guard Anthony Black sitting helplessly on the floor before executing a three-point step-back jumpshot.\n\nOrlando's Jalen Suggs managed a team-high 26 points, but failed to complete the game after suffering with an apparent injury to his left side.\n\nThe Magic also felt the absence of Franz Wagner, their leading scorer this season.\n\nThe NBA Cup, a mid-season knockout tournament now in its third year, is proving a hit with audiences and players.\n\nIt now offers a tantalizing opportunity for the Knicks to win their first overall trophy since 1973.",

    "title": "Analysis: No. 10 BYU explodes offensively in 47-point win over UC Riverside",
    "description": "Another career night from AJ Dybantsa and strong bench contributions powered the Cougars past the Highlanders.",
    "fullText": "When BYU took the Marriott Center floor Saturday night, it was the Cougars’ first appearance at their home arena in 32 days.\n\nAnd what a 32 day stretch it was.\n\nOver that span, BYU hopped on three separate flights to the east coast and two bus trips up to Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Cougars played in six Quad 1 or 2 contests — winning five — and captured a Thanksgiving tournament championship in Florida.\n\nBYU took blue blood UConn down to the wire in Boston, blew out ranked foe Wisconsin at the Delta Center and stormed back to stun Clemson at the buzzer in New York City’s famed Madison Square Garden.\n\nAs eventful as the past 32 days were for the Cougars, it clearly made them a much better team, which was quite evident as BYU stomped UC Riverside 100-53 in Saturday’s long-awaited return to Provo.\n\n“I mean, this place always has energy,” BYU head coach Kevin Young said after the game. “That trip to New York (earlier this week) was great, but it was exhausting. We felt like we were there forever, honestly. We had a pretty exhausting day the day after the game. It took us an hour and 40 minutes to get to the airport, and then we had a five-hour flight.\n\n“It was a long day, so I was honestly a little worried about a letdown getting back home just in terms of like letting our guard down, but that was clearly not the case, so kudos to the guys to respond.”\n\nSuch a response came in the form of BYU’s best offensive showing of the young season, as it crossed the century mark in points and averaging a blistering 1.389 points per possession.\n\nHERE YOU GO @SportsCenter 🤯\n\n📺 ESPN+ | #SCTop10 pic.twitter.com/KQrpnstoyn\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) December 14, 2025\n\nAfter being plagued by slow starts throughout the year, the Cougars instead came out swinging to the tune of 49 first half points before pouring on another 51 after halftime.\n\n“We’re just trying to bring the mentality we have in second halves to the first half,” said AJ Dybantsa. “Obviously, we’ve been coming out pretty lazy. Our second halves have been good, so we just wanted to bring that same mentality to the first half.”\n\nThe Cougars shot 59.1% from the field and 47.4% from 3-point range, dishing out 22 collective assists, scoring 54 paint points, another 29 points in transition and even getting a season-high 36 points from their bench.\n\n“There were a couple of things we wanted to highlight or emphasize coming into this game, and the No. 1 thing offensively was just playing with the pass \n\n“... (We) subsequently had the most fast break points with 29 fast break points, which is easier to do when you’re getting stops obviously, and then 22 assists, you know, that’s more how we want to play, and I thought the guys were really good there.”\n\nFresh off his finest performance to date against Clemson earlier this week, Dybantsa dazzled yet again on his home floor, scoring a game-high 26 points on 11 of 17 shooting and setting new personal bests with eight rebounds, seven assists and five steals.\n\nAnd ever the finisher, 16 of his 26 points came in the second half.\n\nAJ DYBANTSA vs UC Riverside \n\n26 PTS | 8 REB | 7 AST | 0 PF pic.twitter.com/pysbEZ4v7y\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) December 14, 2025\n\n“It was ridiculous what he just did out there,” Young said of Dybantsa. “I mean, he had 26 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, five steals, one block, and probably could have had 50 (points), truly. He’s a special player. That was incredible what he was doing out there. I’m just incredibly impressed with what he did tonight and what he’s done all season. The kid’s good, man, and then everyone feeds off him.\n\n“... We’re gonna win a lot of games because of how good he is, but you know, it’s more about he’s good because he’s talented, but he’s a team guy. They’re hard to find, man. They’re really hard to find.”\n\nIn addition to Dybantsa, Richie Saunders posted 10 points in the game’s first four minutes to end up with a total of 19 points and five rebounds.\n\nRob Wright III scored nine points with six assists, and remaining starters Keba Keita and Kennard Davis Jr. teamed up for 10 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nhere's your regularly scheduled Keba rim rocker\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/NvGQo4A3XQ\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) December 14, 2025\n\nLeading BYU’s encouraging bench charge was backup point guard Aleksej Kostić, who drained five 3-pointers — including a heat check of three in a row in the first half — for 15 points, four assists and a plus/minus of +36 in 22 minutes to draw chants of his name from the ROC student section by game’s end.\n\n“His shot making is a beautiful thing. I mean, that’s why we brought him here,” Young said of Kostić. “We felt like it was a matter of time before he was able to have a game like he had tonight.\n\n“He’s kind of a hybrid between like Trevin (Knell) from last year and Dawson (Baker) because he can play with the ball a little bit more off the dribble, and if he can do that, man, that’s going to be obviously a huge weapon for us. Especially when we sub Rob out, he can do that next to AJ. I like that pairing.”\n\nKostić was joined in his bench excellence by redshirt freshman Khadim Mboup, who notched his first career double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nBut Kostić’s night carries a great deal of significance — having the Austrian newcomer serve as BYU’s ball-handling and sharpshooting option off the bench going forward would be massive in filling the crucial role left by previous sixth man Baker following his season-ending knee injury.\n\n“I always try to stay ready, and when I come in the game, try to shoot. I wouldn’t say it was something different that I did today. I just shoot the ball, and today I made a lot,” Kostić said.\n\n“... It’s of course, very sad that we lose a player like Dawson. They told me that I will have a bigger role, and I’ll try to stay ready and step in his footsteps.”\n\nBYU, now 9-1 on the season and 3-0 at home, will be back at the Marriott Center Tuesday night to face former WCC foe Pacific in the Cougars’ third-to-last contest before the start of Big 12 play in January.",

    "fullText": "MANDEVILLE, La. (WGNO) — Once Mandeville defensive end Nick Ingram got to high school, he hit the books just like he hits the opposition. It paid off, as he has a 4.62 GPA and a score of 34 on the ACT.\n\n“In junior high, I was not very focused on school. But in high school, I really started focusing on my academics,” Ingram said. “Looking at where I am today, I am proud of what I have done. My GPA, my test scores, all that stuff.”\n\nIngram is an AP scholar with multiple outstanding student awards. His academic success stems from making the classroom his top priority.\n\n“Academics are very important to me. As important as football, if not more important,” Ingram said. “If you have a 2.0 GPA, you’re not going to get into a great school since you don’t have the academics for it.”\n\nIngram’s intelligence has also translated to the trenches.\n\n“Nick helps us get lined up in formation. Makes our checks on defense in the box with the front six, he’s been very helpful there,” Mandeville head coach Craig Jones said.\n\nNick is uncertain of where he’ll attend college, but his work as president of the Mandeville youth and government program has helped pave the way for a bright future.\n\n“I think I’ll double major in political science and public policy. It’ll allow me to go into a field with law, so I will probably go to law school afterwards,” Ingram said.\n\nMandeville’s Nick Ingram is our Friday Night Football Scholar Athlete of the Week, brought to you by your Southern Quality Ford Dealers.\n\nStay up to date with the latest news, weather and sports by downloading the WGNO app on the Apple or Google Play stores and by subscribing to the WGNO newsletter.\n\nFNF Southern Quality Ford Dealers Scholar-Athlete of the Week: Mandeville’s Nick Ingram\n\nFNF: Andre Anthony reflects on incredible year-one run as Bonnabel head coach\n\nFNF Championship: No. 14 Ouachita Parish upsets top-seeded Ruston, 21-20, to win Division I Non-Select title\n\nEarly morning showers & storms followed by gusty winds for Sunday\n\nPowerball: Here are the winning numbers for the $1B jackpot",

    "description": "Is this the team to take on the mags?",
    "fullText": "Well, here it is folks – the game we’ve all been ‘looking forward to’. Putting aside all of the noise surrounding the fixture, it’s going to be intriguing from a team selection persepective as to how Regis Le Bris approaches this game. Will we attack from the off or will we try to to soak up their energy before countering? Will we go five at the back or will we be confident in a four? How will our young players adapt to the atmosphere? Loads of questions to be answered during the course of the game – but here’s how I think we’ll go into the match today.\n\nRoefs has been exceptional this season, and his ability to claim the ball in his box will be vital today.\n\nI think we’ll go with a back four today, as we won’t want to give Newcastle a numerical advantage in midfield – that said, I think it’ll be a fluid formation that will enable us to switch with ease. Reinildo’s back after missing City, which is great news, and I think we’ll see Nordi at right back, with Ballard and Alderete in the centre of the defence.\n\nXhaka and Sadiki thankfully came through the City game, and they’ll line up in the centre of midfield – with Le Fee in there too. I think Le Fee’s all round game will be important today and we’ll see him in the thick of the action. The wings are interesting – I have a feeling we’ll see a surprise here, with Trai Hume replicating the role he did later on against Bournemouth and at Liverpool, which gives us strength in front of Mukiele and a bit more protection for Le Fee, too. On the other wing, I’m taking a flyer here and going with Simon Adingra – he’s been left out of the AFCON squad and will have a point to prove. Talbi’s looked a bit indifferent out there in recent games and it’s probably too big an occasion for Mundle to start, so I’m thinking Adingra might get the nod today.\n\nThis is a tough one to call as there are compelling arguments for both Brobbey and Isidor to start – however I think Brobbey’s strength and experience will get the nod to start, with the plan of Isidor coming on for the last 30 against tiring legs. We’ll see…",

    "description": "Who would have thought at 2-0 down to Swansea that a year on it would be time for a Wear-Tyne derby?",
    "fullText": "Christmas comes earlier every year supposedly, but for Sunderland fans it currently feels as if the club is light years on from where it was 12 months ago, when a remarkable come from behind win against Swansea City had us all in raptures.\n\nWe are just 365 days on from that trip to Wales but compare the squad from that match with the team now expected to line up against Newcastle United this afternoon and you will get a real sense for the rate of progress since then. At best there will be three, but most likely fewer, players still involved in the starting XI that were around last season, but whilst some of their old teammates have since dropped out of the picture their roles were essential at the time.\n\nThe promotion winners of 2024-25 helped usher in a new sense of hope at SAFC that has supporters looking very much ahead. It wasn’t all that long ago that people were unsure of what to make of head coach Régis Le Bris however, with the summer appointment experiencing a loss of momentum in the build-up to Last Christmas.\n\nPrior to that, the Lads had been flying under their new French connector. Four Championship wins out of four, with just one goal conceded during the run, had Sunderland leading the fledgling table and it wasn’t until a run of five successive draws that they fell out of the automatic spots. An unfortunate defeat to fellow promotion hopefuls Sheffield United then cast further doubt on the push, with some wondering if Le Bris had just been enjoying a touch of ‘beginners luck’ – only for their fears to be eased when the team showed real determination to see off Stoke City in filthy weather conditions and then grab an equaliser against Bristol City a couple of days after.\n\nPatrick Robert’s last gasp leveller against the Robins certainly set things up nicely ahead of a game with the Swans, but for all it was celebrated that fight-back soon paled into insignificance in terms of drama when put up against the resurgence seen in Glamorgan – Le Bris’ men proving beyond all doubt that they had the mental strength needed to achieve their aims.\n\nThe Jacks had initially taken an early lead through Zan Vipotnik, who capitalised on some defensive hesitancy to score from close range. Having then tested Anthony Patterson, Liam Cullen added a second less than 20 minutes in with a free kick to leave shell shocked Sunderland looking very uncertain, but it wasn’t long before they pulled themselves round – and getting back into things before half-time handed them a vital lifeline.\n\nDan Ballard did well to angle a header into the net as he connected with a set piece that had been whipped into the box by Trai Hume, and once the break was over the Lads started moving building up a head of steam. Now looking more composed and able to push men forward, a string of chances was created before Dan Neil levelled things up with a screamer. Collecting the ball from Jobe, the captain drove through the middle of the park before firing in an unstoppable 20-yard effort, and whilst he was keen to get back on with the action as soon as possible the celebrations that followed the next goal were much more prolonged.\n\nSwansea were the ones that were rocking now, but unlike their opponents they were unable to gather themselves and just two minutes on from Neil’s excellent solo strike they found themselves behind, albeit this Sunderland goal was via an excellent team move. Hume, Patrick Roberts and Chris Rigg worked down the right-hand side before the ball was put on a plate for Jobe to smash past Lawrence Vigouroux, and with the turn around complete wild scenes behind the goal followed.\n\nWith the players as ecstatic as the supporters the ‘limbs’ shown suggested that everybody in red and white knew that this was big. The three points were a massive confidence boost and helped keep the squad in the promotion frame, making this game a pivotal step towards what came afterwards. Since plunging into League One many players have come and gone, and whilst several of them failed to make an impact the ones that did aid the revival will always be valued. Jon McLaughlan for example, an unused substitute for Swansea on this day, did what he could, and the ones that built on that to deliver two promotions and get the club back to where it now is did so, like they did in Wales, by keeping going Til The End…\n\nSwansea City 2 (Vipotnik 5’, Cullen 17’)\n\nSunderland 3 (Ballard 28’, Neil 73’, Jobe 75’)\n\nSunderland: Patterson; Hume, Mepham, Ballard, Cirkin (O’Nien 70’); Rigg, Neil, Jobe; Roberts, Isidor, Mayenda Unused: Moore, Hjelde, Alese, Jones, Aleksić, Aouchiche, Rusyn, Connolly.\n\nSwansea.com Stadium, attendance 15,791",

    "description": "Mark Wood pays tribute to club legend Gary Rowell, whose sad passing was announced last night.",
    "fullText": "At Roker Report, we have put together a number of tributes to ex-players and club legends down the years, but this feels like one of the most difficult.\n\nGary Rowell was a true club legend, and his hat-trick at St. James Park will forever be cemented in club folklore.\n\nHe had earned a legendary status among my own generation of Sunderland fans who saw him play, which he carried on long after he hung up his boots.  His death at a way too early 68 years old, announced in the late hours of Saturday evening and on the eve of the first Wear-Tyne derby for almost 10 years, is sad news for all Sunderland fans.\n\nWhile the man will be mourned among the fanbase, he left us with some of the most amazing memories in a red and white shirt.\n\nGary Rowell was Sunderland through and through. Born in Seaham, he came through the ranks at the club, first making a few appearances for Bob Stokoe’s promotion-winning side of 1976 before making his breakthrough as a first-team regular the following season.\n\nAs Sunderland toiled desperately at the foot of the First Division, the new manager Jimmy Adamson called on the youth of Gary, Shaun Elliott and Kevin Arnott to form a new midfield which nearly and so spectacularly saved the club from relegation.\n\nAlthough playing in midfield at this point in his career, Gary, as well as having an eye for a pass, also weighed in with some crucial goals,notably in a 4-0 win against Middlesbrough, a 6-1 win against West Brom, and a 6-0 win against West Ham.  All in consecutive home games.\n\nThe following season, he began to operate in a more advanced role and began to make a name for himself as a goal scorer – 19 in all competitions -, but his career really began to take off in the 1978-79 season.  Twenty-four goals in thirty-nine appearances – and one game Sunderland fans will remember forever.  24 February 1979 at St. James Park. Sunderland win 4-1 and Gary Rowell scored a hattrick.\n\nA bad injury a few weeks later somewhat interrupted his progress, and some might say took away some of his pace, but when he did come back into the first team, Sunderland were back in the top flight, and Gary had not lost any of his prowess in front of goal.  From the summer of 1980 to the summer of 1984, he was the club’s leading goal scorer in each season, and from 1977-78 to 1984, he was the club’s leading scorer in each season bar one.  There was another hat-trick against Arsenal along the’ way, and it’s fair to say that those goals did so much to keep Sunderland in the First Division.\n\nHe was also a penalty taker of some repute and only ever missed one in 26 attempts.  Watching him take a penalty you could see why – he was very cool, and hit them low, hard and into the corner, a technique which even many of the very best players would love to master.\n\nAll in all, Gary Rowell hit 103 goals in 297 games for Sunderland and it was a complete shock to all fans when he was released by the club at just 26 years of age.\n\nHe still had a couple of outstanding memories to share with Sunderland fans after he left.\n\nThe first was in the League Cup Final of 1985 at Wembley when he was a Norwich player – although injured – he walked around the pitch at the final whistle with the celebrating Norwich squad, but paused in front of the Sunderland fans to chat and sign autographs with them and donned a Sunderland scarf.  He looked for all the world like he wanted to be standing on the terraces with us.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I wrote a ‘Sunderland Great’ article which featured him, and while researching it, I saw a thread mentioning that he had not been well, which I and everyone who got wind of it hoped was not true. Unfortunately, it transpired it was.\n\nIt is awfully sad news, but despite the loss we feel as fans the thoughts of everyone should be with his family.\n\nThe second memory is also from the ‘Sunderland Great’ article and one that sums up the man.\n\nMay 5, 1996, and Peter Reid’s Sunderland are at Tranmere, riding the crest of a wave, confirmed as champions with the fans in full voice.\n\nMidway through the second half and from my seat among the home support I see the whole of the Sunderland support in the stand to my right turn around singing to one guy half way up. ’We all live in a Gary Rowell World’.\n\nAnd it is him, sitting and giving a big grin and a cheery wave back. He absolutely loved it, and while not being at St. James that day but despite witnessing who knows how many of his goals, it is the memory of him I’ll take all day long. Sat in the middle of the Sunderland fans, loving being the centre of attention with a great big smile on his face.\n\nThe Sunderland fans would sing ‘ Gary Rowell is Magic’. He was. Gary Rowell was completely bloody magic.  He’ll be sorely missed, but never forgotten.",

We’ve played them in the play-offs in the past, and when both sides have been struggling at the wrong end of the table, but today feels like a victory would feel hugely symbolic.\n\nNewcastle fans were likely feeling comfortable that we wouldn’t be around to compete for a long time to come. Still, the accelerated progress has led us from League One play-offs to competing as equals in under four years, and we’re making the most of it. Whatever happens, we know we’re back, but it would be the cherry on top of a stupidly big sundae if we collect three points today.\n\nWe’ve mentioned our unbeaten record at home, and Eddie Howe’s side had a timely reminder of what it feels like to win on the road a fortnight ago – as they beat a very poor Everton for their first win away from home this season. Three draws and three defeats make up the other six, and it remains their weakness on paper this season.\n\nThe expectations were high after collecting more than half the total of our summer outlay from Liverpool for Isak, but three wins in the first eleven fell short of what they hoped. Three wins and a draw in the last four have improved the picture, but they didn’t have it all their own way at home to Burnley last weekend, and the trip to Germany with Bayer Leverkusen scoring a late equaliser.\n\nHowever, that occurrence in midweek isn’t anything new, with Newcastle conceding nine goals in the final ten minutes of games in all competitions this season. The goal in Germany had the players, manager, and pundits all questioning their mentality.\n\nWith the effort of midweek and the visit of Chelsea at the weekend, and a trip to Old Trafford coming quickly after that, they’ll know that their biggest test out of those could be today.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 9/4 to win the game, while that lot are priced at 6/5, and the draw is 9/4.\n\n[Ballard (OG) 35’, Isak 46’, 90’ (pen)]\n\nSunderland: Patterson, Hume, O’Nien, Ballard, Alese, Ekwah, Neil, Pritchard, Bellingham, Clarke, Rusyn (Ba) Substitutes not used: Bishop, Pembele, Seelt, Triantis, Rigg, Aouchiche, Hemir, Burstow\n\nNewcastle United: Dubravka, Trippier, Burn (Dummett), Guimaraes, Schar (Lascelles), Botman, Almiron (Livramento), Longstaff, Isak, Joelinton (Miley), Gordon (Ritchie) Substitutes not used: Karius, Krafth, Hall\n\nWell, it’s usually a choice between 2-1 or 3-0… so I’m going 2-1.",

    "title": "Nevada Survives Another Nail Biter in 78-75 Win over Duquesne",
    "description": "Another down to the wire game, and now it’s time for conference play.",
    "fullText": "Nevada hosted Duquesne on Saturday night, a game that wasn’t 100 percent guaranteed to happen. A power outage hit the north side of campus, which included Lawlor Events Center. The outage forced the Nevada women’s game to go into a no-contest and there was uncertainty if it would be back on in time for the men’s tip-off.\n\nLuckily, power was restored, and a win was granted to Nevada, beating Duquesne 78-75 in another nail-biter that came down to the wire. This game was a constant momentum shift, with both sides trading off dominant runs and long scoring droughts.\n\nNevada was playing behind to start, but Chuck Bailey was keeping Nevada in it early on. Six of Nevada’s eight early points came from Bailey inside.\n\nThe offense took advantage of the Duke’s scoring drought, going on a 15-0 run that included a three-pointer by Peyton White, giving Nevada its first lead of the game. White hit a mid-range jumper followed by three from Amire Robinson, giving Nevada a quick seven point lead in a matter of minutes.\n\nNevada’s offense just kept on pounding. A 25-6 run over a span of 10 minutes helped give the Wolf Pack a lead as high as 14 points toward the end of the first half. Nearly half of Nevada’s points in that first half came from inside the paint as it took a 42-35 lead into halftime. Nevada also shot over 50 percent from the field in the first half.\n\nA hot start to the second half for Duquesne was a cold one for Nevada. The Pack collected eight points to open up before hitting a scoring drought, allowing Duquesne to close within a few points. The drought lasted a little over three minutes before freshman Myles Walker hit a three to extend the game to 53-49.\n\nIt was off and on for Nevada’s offense from there, which allowed the Dukes to tie and then take the lead on a Nevada scoring drought that lasted over three minutes. A free throw by Elijah Price and a layup by Tayshawn Comer allowed Nevada to retake a slim 72-71 lead with 1:13 to go.\n\nIt came down to free throws, which Nevada made 24-32 to seal a close 78-75 win. Nevada went 7-8 from the free-throw line in the final minute of the half to seal its eighth win.\n\n“What can you say about your freshmen, Myles [Walker] and Peyton [White], who continue to make veteran plays,” Alford said. “That was a highly contested game, down to the wire, and you got two freshmen going to the line the last two trips and go 4-4 at the line, that’s big time.”\n\nDuquesne opened up the game with two quick threes on some missed defensive switches for Nevada. There were two quick turnovers for the Pack in the first seven minutes of the half that turned into six points for the Dukes.\n\nAfter going up by eight for a 16-8 lead, Duquesne went on a scoring drought of over five minutes. The Dukes also gave up three turnovers in that span. They broke out of the dry spell just under the 10-minute mark with another shot beyond the arc.\n\nDuquesne closed the gap a bit but didn’t shoot the best in the first half, going 36 percent from the field and 39 percent from beyond the arc. Guards Tarence Guinyard and Jimmie Williams both collected double digits in that first half, but the rest of the Duke’s offense was slow. Guinyard ended the night as the Dukes’ lead scorer with 21 points on 5-11 shooting.\n\nThe Dukes opened the second half with much more pace, leading to a 7-0 run before Nevada had to take a timeout.\n\nIt was much more tight-knit within the final 10 minutes, as both sides traded momentum. With 2:04 to go, Duquesne made a three to tie the game at 69 and used a turnover to take the lead in the middle of a 9-0 run. All in all, Nevada’s defense may have played hot potato, but it closed it out when it needed to. Duquesne finished shooting 39 percent from the field and 33 from three.\n\n“I didn’t think our start and finish in the first half was very good defensively,” head coach Steve Alford said. “In the middle, it was really good, and then to start the second half was bad, but we closed out some good stops.”\n\nNevada will begin conference play next weekend, and it’ll do it from the comfort of its own home. The Wolf Pack will host rival Boise State on Saturday, Dec. 20, at Lawlor. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. PST.\n\nThe Broncos are coming off a dominant win over Duquesne a week ago and will be playing St Mary’s tomorrow night.\n\n“Beat ‘em [Boise State],” Amire Robinson said about what the mindset is going into the first conference game of the year. “We didn’t come out good against Duquesne, and they beat Duquesne pretty good, so we got to shove back and really kill them this time.”",

    "description": "“This is what a derby is — memories passed from one generation to the next”, writes Michael Dunne.",
    "fullText": "My first ever Sunderland game was on 24 February 2002 — a Wear-Tyne Derby.\n\nThis was the first game my father brought me to and I recall the build up like it happened yesterday. The face paint, putting on my Sunderland jersey with “Phillips” on the back (because the club shop had run out of the numbers 1 and 0!) and the increasing sense of trepidation and anticipation as the kick off time approached.\n\nWe lost that game 0-1 due to the magnificent performance of Shay Given in the Newcastle goal, and it crushed me as an Irish goalkeeper destroyed a little eight year old Irish boy’s dreams on his first trip to Sunderland.\n\nThe heartbreak didn’t last too long, as like the resilient Sunderland fan I’ve become, you learn to grudgingly accept defeat and chase that next high; the next opportunity to roar, to celebrate a goal and to hug the ones close to you when these moments occur.\n\nAs some may already know, I’m not from the area nor the country, but my passion for this club goes back to the beginning of my supporting days back in 2002.\n\nIt was the way the people made me feel on my first trip with the Irish Sunderland Supporters Club, as it was then. How the Belfast branch dressed me up for the occasion with their face paint and scarves, and how I would readily begin a conversation with anyone in the city who would talk Sunderland AFC with me.\n\nThe Sunderland AFC I knew back then was lost along the way — through chaos, decline and ridicule — but it’s fought its way back to become something we can believe in again.\n\nToday, my father and I will fly from Dublin to see our team take on their greatest enemy almost twenty five years on from that trip, and we’ll be there with immense pride in where Kyril Louis-Dreyfus, Kristjaan Speakman and Régis Le Bris have brought the club in such a short space of time.\n\nFor years, this club has been the butt of a joke, the laughing stock of the football community and Netflix’s black comedy success story, but that Sunderland is well and truly gone.\n\nIn many ways, this edition of the derby is an opportunity for the players but especially the fans to announce that we aren’t the jokers anymore. It’s another opportunity for this club to show that it belongs here and to seize the moment and the occasion.\n\nWe’re a proud fanbase but we’re also a fanbase that’ll back our players to the hilt once we see the effort on the pitch. Today, we must match the effort on the pitch with noise that’ll rattle in the stands and that a young kid will remember for a lifetime — just like I did twenty five years ago.\n\nDespite my confident prediction that we’ll win, today is another chapter on the new story of Sunderland AFC. It could be the day that a new generation of fans will be hooked by this incredible football club, and it’s a day to make new memories.\n\nLong after the result is forgotten, it won’t be the scoreline that remains.\n\nInstead, it’ll be the walk to the ground, the nervous laughter, the roar that shakes your chest, and the arms you find yourself wrapped in when the ball hits the Newcastle net. This is what a derby is — memories passed from one generation to the next. And today, once again, we go to make another one.",

    "description": "Roker Report reader Keith Davison has shared his memories of Gary Rowell with us.",
    "fullText": "Gary Rowell’s greatest moment was probably the hat trick he scored against Newcastle in a 4-1 win for the Lads away at Sid James Park.\n\nIn 1979 I was just a naïve teenager scared of my own shadow and definitely scared of football ‘hooligans’. But football was my obsession, and when my older and much more street-wise brother (who had a bit of hooligan experience himself) suggested that the best way to watch the derby at Sid James was to go incognito amongst the bar codes, I jumped at the idea.\n\nWe’d then be able to travel to and from the ground amongst them and be safer than if we went in the away end and then had to get away home as being obviously from Sunderland.\n\nYounger readers will be shocked to hear that in those days you could just turn up to a ground on the day of the match and pay at the gate. No all-ticket matches, no purchase history required, no BCPs. This was a reasonable enough idea and did work in terms of getting us to the game safely.\n\nWhat we hadn’t contemplated and planned for was the Lads winning 4-1 and Lord Rowell scoring a hat trick.\n\nYou can imagine what the atmosphere was like among the mags at seeing their team dismantled by Rowell that day with a clinical display of finishing. You will also be able to imagine what it was like to be a Sunderland supporter being amongst this angry mob and not being able to celebrate.\n\nI was later to discover that at 4-1 up Rowell had a discussion with Kevin Arnott about whether to go for a 5th goal or to just to take the piss. Apparently they decided to take the piss and annoy the locals more. Thanks lads.\n\nAnyway, we did make it out of the ground safely and went back to the multi-storey car park where we had parked up. We got into the car park lift alongside an old couple returning from a shopping trip, and finally, much to their shock, we were able to celebrate the Lads’ success properly after 90 minutes of bottling it up. They must have thought we were crackers.\n\nWhen I think of Rowell I find it difficult to describe him and his attributes. He wasn’t fast and skilful like Marco, he couldn’t dribble around teams like McGeady or even Nedum Onuoha. He wasn’t a tackler like Cattermole or Bally.\n\nWhat he did do was score goals. He always seemed to be in the right place or just be able to create the right amount of space to get a shot away. He never seemed to blast the ball into the net – it was always more of a pass right into the corner of the net and out of the keeper’s reach. I don’t recall him scoring many spectacular goals – I just remember him scoring lots of goals.\n\nI remember when he first came into the team I thought he was just going to be a fairly steady midfield player. He didn’t particularly stand out, but gradually, as Stokoe began to shake up the cup-winning team from 1973, and then Stokoe himself left, Rowell went from being a bit-part player to our leading man and top goal scorer. When he was joined in the first team by Arnott and Elliott the sudden burst of youthful enthusiasm totally revived the team.\nI never met the man, but nothing I have heard about him would lead me to think anything other of him than – Gary Rowell, a true Sunderland legend, one of our own, and a boyhood hero of my generation.",

    "description": "It’s the big one. The game we’ve all been waiting for: Newcastle at home. Time to step up, Lads!",
    "fullText": "Score prediction: Sunderland 2 Newcastle 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Granit Xhaka\n\nA big, big day on Wearside. This is a huge game in our resurgence — and a win here could be the cherry on top of what’s been an exceptional 2025.\n\nIt’ll be a tough game, but I’m hoping beyond hope that we can get the win today, which will be worth more than three points.\n\nFirst scorer? Xhaka to lead by example in a tense, tight and nervy win.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Newcastle 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Wilson Isidor\n\nThe Lads have had a full week off to rest, recover and train ready for today. They’ll be ready for battle and baying for blood after the disappointment of a 3-0 loss away to Manchester City last weekend.\n\nThat passion for victory should especially be the case against this collection of over-entitled pond life, who seem to think since winning the League Cup, they’re even more of “the dog’s nob” than before, and it’s our turn to wake up this bunch of self indulgent, tree-felling, oppressive-regime-loving saddos.\n\nWe’re back, we’re on the up, and you’re next. Can you deal with the 2025/2026 version of Sunderland AFC? I don’t think so.\n\nMonologues aside, Newcastle have had a wee resurgence of late, closing the points gap behind us well, but they’ll be tired from their midweek Champions League game and I’m sure they’ll have absolutely no idea about the wall of red and white which is about to hit them at 100mph.\n\nIsidor is going to get our first for me, using his pace against a less-than-mobile backline — including Dan “The Tanker” Burn.\n\nDan Ballard will get a second early in the second half to get his own back for that deflected own goal in the cup game, and we’ll cruise the rest of the game without incident, wondering what all the fuss was about.\n\nI’ve manifested it, lads. Go and do it. It’s nothing less than you’re capable of.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 3 Newcastle 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Enzo Le Fée\n\nAre you nervous yet? Because they are.\n\nIt’s to our great credit that we go into this game one point ahead of our rivals and I’m sure that despite the usual nonsense spouted, they know they’re coming into a real game after a slow start to their Premier League season.\n\nI expect it to be a physical, fast-paced affair. They like to mix it (see also: “cheat”) and can break with speed, so our midfield maestro Granit Xhaka will be pivotal in keeping us organised and driving us on against a set of robust players.\n\nAnother tiring trip for Newcastle in midweek to drop points again at Bayer Leverkusen will have taken its toll, and we have to take full advantage of that. Having Noah Sadiki and his outrageous energy against a team who’ve already played once this week looks even more dangerous now — thank the red and white gods that those yellow cards were avoided.\n\nI fancy Le Fée to follow in the footsteps of Patrice Carteron and Djibril Cissé, with a tenacious display and a sumptuous goal to go with it.\n\nThe Stadium of Light has proved a fortress so far this season but on Sunday, we prepare for war.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Newcastle 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Noah Sadiki\n\nAll the noise this week has been from them: excuses, downplaying it and pretending they’re not rattled. But they know exactly what’s waiting at 2:00pm: a Stadium of Light that’s been itching for this.\n\nWe look built for this battle; Granit Xhaka running the show, Dan Ballard and Omar Alderete as solid as granite, and Noah Sadiki ready to outrun every black and white shirt in sight. Hit them early, win the duels, keep the tempo high, and this is our game to grab.\n\nI fancy Sadiki to spark it off: press, pinch it, slot it, bedlam.\n\nDerbies come down to desire. And this time, it’s our lads who want it more.\n\nScore prediction: Newcastle 2 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Dan Ballard\n\nForget the years spent lost in the doldrums of League One. Forget the sneering Mags who laughed at our misfortune and forget the 0-3 in the FA Cup, because this time, we meet them as equals.\n\nThe superiority complex runs deep on the dark side of the North East and the narrative is that this is their “third most important game of the week”.\n\nThat’s fine. Underestimate us at your peril, because I have no doubt these lads know exactly what this means to the fans.\n\nThis is their chance to write themselves into folklore and to become heroes on Wearside.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 5 Newcastle 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Dan Ballard\n\nWe’re going to come out all guns blazing and score three before Newcastle actually realise they’re playing.\n\nThey’ll come out in the second half the better team, score a goal, and Granit Xhaka will rally the troops to punish them further until the ninetieth minute.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Newcastle 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Dan Ballard\n\nForm and league position can go in the bin — it’s ninety minutes decided by who wants it more, a bit of quality, and a bit of luck.\n\nFor occasions like this, we have the players I want in my team: Granit Xhaka, Dan Ballard, Omar Alderete, Nordi Mukiele, Reinildo, Noah Sadiki…and I could go on.\n\nI have full confidence in the Lads that they understand the importance of this game and how much it means to the fans and the city. And they’ll certainly feel that on the day, just when they thought they understood.\n\nAs long as they show the unwavering commitment on the pitch that we’ve seen already, and strike a balance with their emotions, I believe we’ll win this match.\n\nBallard getting the first goal would be immense and a signal of how far he’s grown since the last time.\n\nThe Mags don’t get to play this fixture down now it’s here and tell us we are over the top, whilst it’s not as big a game for them — you’re not fooling us.\n\nThere’s too many receipts out there, and we’re here to collect.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 3 Newcastle 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Granit Xhaka\n\nThe boys did OK for the first third of the game at Manchester City, but when we were undone by a deflection and then a set piece, it rapidly became clear this run was simply too much with tough games in quick succession. The third City goal was quality that we simply can’t argue against. Lovely stuff — sadly against us and not by us.\n\nWe had some great chances for Enzo Le Fée, Granit Xhaka and Wilson Isidor and on another day, two or even all three of them would’ve gone in rather than narrowly missing, hitting the woodwork or being saved.\n\nIt was a step too far to face Liverpool and City away and so close to each other, but we left with our heads held high, and now we need to focus on the big one.\n\nMost of the lads went for either a loss or a draw, with the odd outlier, which brought in just a few points for a few of the team.\n\nNo points for first scorer as nobody went for a loss to nil, either.\n\nMinor moves in the table only, with only four points between sixth place and top.\n\nFour points is exactly what you get for the right score and first scorer.\n\nEasy for anyone to rally across Christmas, then!\n\nJust a quick reminder of how we allocate points to our match-by-match predictions:\n\nCorrect outcome (but not correct score) = One point\n\nCorrect first Sunderland goalscorer = One point (no goalscorer is a valid call)\n\nPossible deductions for being lazy and not submitting on time = a two-point deduction.",

    "fullText": "A Premier League player has been tipped to join Chelsea now very soon in a move that could see one in and one out.\n\nThe news comes off the back of Chelsea getting back to winning ways yesterday afternoon by beating Everton 2-0 in the Premier League. It was a game that many Blues fans had been fearing due to a rough run of form lately.\n\nThere was a bizarre reaction from Enzo Maresca after the game when he complained about the lack of support that he has been receiving lately, the worst he has experienced since he’s been at the club according to the gaffer.\n\nIt was Malo Gusto who grabbed the decisive second goal in the game to finish things off in what was a fine overall display from the right back yesterday.\n\nAnd now, another player is being tipped to join this squad under Maresca.\n\nKobbie Mainoo with a Chelsea and Man U logo. (Photo by Ben Roberts Photo/Getty Images)\n\nFormer Everton CEO Keith Wyness told Football Insider he’s heard Manchester United are lining up a one in, one out swap of two England internationals:\n\n“I think it’s very unfair and I think that Mainoo, look, he’s a squandered talent in that sense. I just don’t think he’s, for some reason, he hasn’t caught [Ruben] Amorim’s eye. He thinks he doesn’t fit the style.\n\n“I think that they decided that Adam Wharton is going to be one of their targets and I think that Mainoo may find himself reinventing himself at Chelsea.\n\n“That’s where I see the situation going and that’s the whispers I’ve been hearing. I think it would be good for Mainoo. I think he needs to get out of there and move forward.”",

    "description": "Liverpool’s head coach was upbeat following their 2-nil victory over Brighton.",
    "fullText": "It’s been sometime since Liverpool have felt like the play and results have felt like they were reflective of defending champions. With their comprehensive 2-nil victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday, Liverpool can not only claim back-to-back victories, but also point to a current streak of 5 matches unbeaten.\n\nFor head coach Arne Slot, it’s clear that while the point is to bring victories, being able to keep the opposition out of the goal is a prime objective. So, it’s unsurprising that Slot would have mentioned keeping this clean sheet – and the others within this solid run for the Reds – within the remarks he gave following the match.\n\n“In my opinion, we are starting to play better and better on the ball as well. And from the last five games we’ve played, we kept three clean sheets and that is something to build on, especially after conceding four against PSV [Eindhoven] and three against Nottingham Forest.”\n\nLots of talk has surrounded the club, especially through the difficult stretch they seem to be climbing out of, with much of it focusing on the seeming difficulty of the coaching staff to find the right balance between defense and attack given the new offensive weapons acquired during the transfer windows. If this match were to serve as an indicator of progress on that project, though, the boss would have you think there’s more work to be done.\n\n“That’s funny, this is what people now say if you win 2-0 and then all of a sudden we were solid. But I think we conceded in one game more than we did in the last four games. But now all of a sudden it’s solid because we won the game. And when we had a draw or are conceding in the last minute against Leeds, I assume that people weren’t as positive as after this game.”\n\nWhile it might seem harsh to assess what felt a solid victory as something that should be improved, the stats say the boss isn’t far off. According to Opta, the xG battle actually went – ever so marginally – towards Brighton, with a draw being a pretty fair assessment based on the data set.\n\nLiverpool fans, though, would have found it rather harsh given how well the team looked moving forward with scuffed chances from Mohamed Salah among them. And speaking of the Egyptian goalscorer, it was inevitable given the past week that Slot would be asked about the relationship with Mo. The Dutchman gave a straightforward refusal to get drawn in, though, opting to toe a line that expressed clear respect and admiration but provided nothing in terms of specifics on the current state of things.\n\n“I think the reason why he wasn’t in Milan was his interview and the question is always – and everybody has a different opinion about that – should he be once, twice, three times, four times, four months, 12 years… every manager makes [a] different decision in that. He wasn’t involved in the game against Milan, I spoke to him yesterday and usually I never say anything about what we talk about, I am not going to make an exception now but I think actions speak louder than what has been said. He was in the squad again and when I had to make my first substitution, I brought him in and he performed as I think every fan – including me – would like him to perform today.”\n\nAll told, it’s the type of professional media appearance you’d expect from a top-flight manager. Slot has come in for a lot of criticism over the past week with some it being warranted and a surprising amount seeming to be pot-shots at a coach trying to manage a grieving football club through a difficult patch on the pitch. It is not an excuse for the poor results, but it certainly helps me to maintain a certain perspective on Slot and the lads; that this season is a gift and the matches will be opportunities for the squad to band closer together.\n\nIt’s not the most rigorous approach to sport and fandom, but with a Premier League trophy in tow and the weight of losing a friend overshadowing things, I’m having a hard time mustering up too much angst – even when things were going wrong. I’m happy for every day we get to see this group and, in particular, the opportunity to watch the remnants of Klopp’s core try to figure out if they’ve got one more evolution in them.\n\nI’ve counted this team out before and they’ve managed to surprise. Maybe, this season, it’ll all click and we’ll get a run of form to rival anything we’ve seen before. But on the off-chance that doesn’t happen, I’m just glad this team is trending in the right direction. Progress. That’s all I need.",

    "description": "This is pretty high praise for a rookie.",
    "fullText": "76ers rookie named one of best NBA players under 25 years old originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne thing that the Philadelphia 76ers have been able to do relatively well over the past decade or so is infusing the roster with young talent.\n\nBack in 2017, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were both ranked highly on ESPN’s list of the top NBA players under 25 years old. Embiid ranked No. 4 on the list that year, and Simmons placed 10th.\n\nLast year, guard Tyrese Maxey came in at No. 6 on The Ringer’s iteration of the top players under 25 list. This year, it’s V.J. Edgecombe’s turn. Philadelphia’s prized rookie was recently ranked by ESPN as the 19th-best player under 25.\n\n\"While there have been some predictable rookie growing pains, Edgecombe has largely rewarded the 76ers' decision to pick him third, with his explosiveness attacking the paint and flashes of defensive playmaking that point to major long-term upside. The future of the franchise rests on Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey, and how well Philly can develop them in tandem.\"\n\nEdgecombe stepped right into a starting spot for the Sixers this season, and he’s been impressive. In 21 appearances, he’s averaging 14.7 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.3 steals per performance.\n\nWhile the raw numbers aren’t staggering, Edgecombe has shown the Sixers everything that they could have hoped to see from him at this early point in his career. He’s an elite athlete who can get to the rim almost at will and finish once there. He’s also shown an ability to space the floor, as he’s shooting 38 percent from long range and nearly 44 percent on catch-and-shoot opportunities from distance.\n\nBut, he’s been perhaps even more impressive on the defensive end where he’s shown the potential to be an elite perimeter defender. Last month, Sixers coach Nick Nurse even referred to Edgecombe as one of the best defenders on the team. He truly has All-Defensive team talent and potential.\n\nAs we've seen with the likes of Ben Simmons, being named as one of the best players under 25 isn't a guarantee that a player's potential will be realized, but it's high praise nonetheless, especially for a rookie.",

Royval ripped a nice body kic but absorbed a counter right hand in response. Royval was active with his kicks but didn’t commit his weight to all of them. Kape flurried forward with a couple nice body punches. Royval blasted another kick, but Kape backed him into the fence and unloaded with a vicious right hook.\n\nRoyval hit the floor in a heap! Royval tried to pop back up but found himself under a hail of fast power punches. Royval went out cold at least once and then woke back up as the referee moved to intervene. “Raw Dog” protested, but this was a clean KO from “Starboy.”\n\nIs this Kape finally living up to his potential? He just blitzed the No. 2-ranked Flyweight in the world and made it look pretty easy.

    "fullText": "The final UFC fight of 2025, and on ESPN, was a short one. In a battle of flyweight contenders, Manel Kape made short work of Brandon Royval with a first-round knockout Saturday at UFC Vegas 112, earning his eighth win in his past nine fights.\n\nWith such a one-sided win over a one-time title challenger, Kape made his case for a title shot against new UFC flyweight champion Joshua Van, though he might have to get in line.\n\nThe fight was fairly even for the first couple of minutes, but it ended almost immediately after Kape landed a right hook that left Royval falling to the mat. A few more strikes and referee Herb Dean had seen enough at the 3:18 mark of the opening round, even though Royval wasn't happy with the stoppage.\n\nThe last UFC fight of 2025 was ended in style by @ManelKape 😲 #UFCVegas112pic.twitter.com/uwtIhwQ8EZ\n\n— Uncrowned (@uncrownedcombat) December 14, 2025\n\nKape had a rude welcome to the UFC in 2021, suffering back-to-back losses to Alexandre Pantoja (a tough first assignment in retrospect) and Matheus Nicolau. Since then, he has been on a tear, earning three straight wins by finish since his last loss to Muhammad Mokaev. He was supposed to face Royval in June, but had to withdraw due to a broken foot.\n\nVan took that spot and used it as a launching pad to his successful title shot against Pantoja, won via freak injury at UFC 323.\n\nKape took the opportunity Saturday to call out the Houston-based champ. It was one of the more colorful callouts you will ever hear:\n\n\"Joshua Van, you have my belt. If I hadn't broke my feet in July, I would be the champion right now. Now baby, listen very well. I'm here, your daddy. Your daddy is going to take your diapers, alive, on the new deal, Paramount deal. I'm going to take your diapers, alive.\n\n\"Be ready, because you are in Houston, right? Let's fight in Houston in February, or whatever you want. Just sign the contract. Houston is my city.\"\n\nKape's win doesn't make the UFC's path forward at flyweight any simpler. Tatsuro Taira was quickly presented as a natural option for Van following his own win over Brandon Moreno at UFC 323, and Pantoja had the kind of run atop the division that warrants an immediate rematch as soon as he's healthy. But Kape sure looks like a guy who can challenge for the belt soon.\n\nCheck out full UFC Vegas 112 results and highlights below.\n\nFlyweight: Manel Kape def.

    "fullText": "It was Dave Shondell's three-word reply on social media that became the rallying cry for Purdue volleyball.\n\n\"We not dead,\" Shondell posted March 28, a response to an account that claimed NIL had killed the Boilermaker volleyball program.\n\nPurdue then spent 34 matches during the 2025 season backing up their coach's belief.\n\nIt concluded Saturday night in Fitzgerald Field House against top-seeded and regional host Pitt, a 25-22, 25-21, 22-25, 25-17 winner, in the Elite Eight, the Panthers' fifth straight Final Four appearance.\n\nBefore it ended, though, the Boilermakers made one thing perfectly clear: Purdue volleyball did not die.\n\nAfter losing 92.5% of its offense from a season ago, including four potential starting players who transferred elsewhere, Purdue rebuilt its roster through the portal and with returnees stepping into larger roles.\n\nThe Boilermakers went 27-7, reaching their first regional final since 2021.\n\n\"I will never forget this year,\" junior outside hitter Kenna Wollard, a first-team All-Big Ten selection and Midwest Region Player of the Year, said. \"Everything we've gone through and everything we've accomplished has just been absolutely amazing.\n\n\"The girls that I played with this year were so, so special to me.\"\n\nOn Wollard: Elite 8 run inspires Purdue volleyball coach to sign new contract\n\nPurdue will lose four players from its roster: Rachel Williams, Julia Kane, Lindsey Miller and Akasha Anderson, the latter two transfers who played just one season with the Boilermakers.\n\nShondell opened his post-match news conference following the team's season-ending loss with a cautionary tale of current-age college athletics in its era of name, image and likeness, revenue sharing and mass transfers.\n\n\"It was a meaningful season for Purdue and a meaningful season, as I told our team, for college athletics,\" Shondell said. \"First of all, college athletics has changed. It's not going to go backwards ... I think teams and programs and administrations just have to recognize that when people do decide to leave, you wish them well and you go find more players.\n\n\"If your program truly is a positive program that develops athletes and provides great experiences, players will come into your program and you'll be able to continue. I think that's what we were able to do at Purdue.\"\n\n1 on 1: Dave Shondell was ready to retire, how 'ever grateful' Purdue reenergized him\n\nPurdue welcomed in five new faces via the portal: Anderson (Michigan State), Miller (USC), Bianka Lulić (Miami), Dior Charles (Wake Forest) and Nataly Moravec (Iowa). Purdue tied a program record with five All-Big Ten selections, which included All-Midwest Region honorees Grace Heaney, Taylor Anderson and Ryan McAleer, all returnees.\n\nAn offseason was spent as much on relationship building as much as skill development.\n\nPurdue's volleyball program didn't die. It got better.\n\n\"When I got there in the spring, it felt like people just were a little broken, emotionally and mentally, and I feel like the entire team just used the entire spring, in the summer, in the fall, to just completely love each other with open arms,\" Akasha Anderson said. \"I think that's just been shown on every single game that we've won, every single game that we've lost, this team just loves each other.\n\n\"If they keep that up, that's just going to take them so far.\"\n\nNathan Baird and Sam King have the best Purdue sports coverage, and \n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Purdue volleyball proves it can win in NIL era of college athletics",

    "fullText": "Manchester City travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace in what promises to be an entertaining Premier League affair later this afternoon.\n\nThe Cityzens will be out for vengeance after falling to the Eagles in the 2024/25 FA Cup final, but Palace have proven they’re no pushovers this season.\n\nNevertheless, City head into the game in remarkable form, having won four consecutive games in all competitions, most recently claiming a 2-1 Champions League win against familiar foes Real Madrid.\n\nLos Blancos got off to a fine start when Rodrygo broke the deadlock just before the half-hour mark, but goals from Nico O’Reilly and Erling Braut Haaland helped City turn the game on its head.\n\nBefore that fixture, City had seen off Leeds United, Fulham, and Sunderland to keep pace with Arsenal at the Premier League summit.\n\nThe Gunners extended their lead with a 2-1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, so it’s up to City to respond, but it may not be straightforward.\n\nCity have a dominant record against Palace. They’ve won four of their last seven league meetings with the Eagles (D3), but the FA Cup final is proof that Palace have what it takes to halt their momentum.\n\nThe last time Pep Guardiola made sweeping changes to his starting line-up, City paid the price with a 2-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nSince then, the Spaniard has made it a habit of keeping the core of the squad intact, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he makes just one change to his starting XI against Palace.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma is guaranteed to retain his place in goal ahead of out-of-favour James Trafford, while a back four of O’Reilly, Josko Gvardiol, Ruben Dias, and Mathues Nunes should also remain intact.\n\nThe minor tweak expected should come in midfield, although Nico Gonzalez is expected to keep his place while Rodri continues his recovery.\n\nTijjani Reijnders should come in for Bernardo Silva, who wasn’t at his best against Madrid.\n\nThe 31-year-old’s 6/10 performance might be a sign of fatigue, so Reijnders, who has notched seven goal contributions (two goals and five assists), could get a chance.\n\nThe Dutchman will likely be joined by Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki, and Phil Foden, while Haaland leads the line.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City will enter today’s pivotal Premier League fixture against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park off the back of four consecutive victories in all competitions. Pep Guardiola’s side scraped their way to wins over Leeds United and Fulham. They put in arguably their best performance of the season to beat Sunderland 3-nil last weekend at the Etihad. They followed that win with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. It is clear that this City side is beginning to build real momentum ahead of a critical stage of the 25/26 season. They’ll face a tough test against a well-organised Crystal Palace side to continue the momentum they have built.\n\nWe are now seeing that Pep Guardiola’s side is developing the tough edge that previous Manchester City sides have been renowned for. City scrapped and fought their way to a crucial win against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu and that win should fill this City side with confidence and self-belief. The win over Real Madrid was Manchester City’s fourth consecutive win in all competitions and the manner of City’s win in Madrid showed that this City side is in a good position ahead of a critical stage of the 25/26 season.\n\nIn an interview with mancity.com, Ruben Dias has shared his belief that this new-look City team is in a good position. But they must continue to progress and grow if they wish to continue their momentum and challenge for honours at the end of this season. He explained: “We all have to work out how we can be as profitable as possible for the team. For the team. And in that sense, I think that as one of the captains, as one of the team leaders, you have and we have this mission to make it very clear what the essentials are – the things our team can’t live without.”\n\n“And I think we’re getting better and better at that. In that sense, everyone feels and knows exactly how they can best contribute to the team. I feel like we’re in a good place, but I still feel we have a lot of progress to make.”\n\nPep Guardiola’s side will face a tough test against Crystal Palace today if they wish to continue their recent momentum and continue the process of growing as a team. Oliver Glasner’s side is tough to beat at Selhurst Park and they are a team that is well-organised defensively and is also packed with quality all over the pitch. Defensively, Palace have the second-best defence in the Premier League. They have only conceded 12 goals in 15 Premier League matches and their defensive solidity forms the foundation of their play. Marc Guehi and Maxine Lacroix form the backbone of their defence. Dean Henderson is a proven Premier League goalkeeper who helps give Palace a strong defensive foundation.\n\nBut Crystal Palace are more than just a solid defensive outfit. With Jean-Philippe Mateta, Adam Wharton, Daniel Munoz, Yéremy Pino and Eddie Nketiah in their lineup, they do pack a punch in the final third. Oliver Glasner’s squad is well-constructed and they will pose a tough challenge for Manchester City to overcome today.\n\nManchester City have built real momentum in recent matches. They are also growing as a team and the scope for them to grow even further is clear to see. They’ll face a tough test against a quality opponent today in Crystal Palace. Oliver Glasner’s side has the talent to provide a stern test for Pep Guardiola’s side. If City can overcome Palace at Selhurst Park it could be a result that could see them progress as a team as Ruben Dias has demanded.",

    "fullText": "It was just one of those nights for the Washington Capitals (18-10-4). They put up one of their weaker performances and got crushed 5-1 by the Winnipeg Jets (15-15-1) on Saturday.\n\nFrom the get-go, the Capitals just couldn’t get much going, as they only totaled three shots in the first period.\n\nThe Capitals’ performance was so bad to the point where they trailed 5-0 in the third period. It took a 5-on-3 opportunity for the team to end the shutout, thanks to Jakob Chychrun.\n\nIt also didn’t help that defending Hart Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck made his return for Winnipeg after his injury.\n\nLogan Thompson did all he could as he stopped 30 of 35 shots, but wasn’t given much help from his teammates.\n\nWith this result, the Capitals’ nine-game point streak comes to an end. They will look to regroup as they visit the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday.\n\nComing off the previous game, it seemed like the Capitals’ offense had been sputtering. Saturday’s loss against Winnipeg wasn’t any better.\n\nThe Capitals got off to another slow start, as they were outshot by Winnipeg 13-3 and trailed 2-0 in the opening period.\n\nDefending Hart Trophy winner Hellebuyck made his return for Winnipeg after missing time due to knee surgery. He was too much for the Capitals as he stopped 24 of 25 shots.\n\nThe Capitals struggled on the 5-on-5 throughout the night, failing to generate much pressure or enter the zone cleanly. Carbery changed up the lines, with Brandon Duhaime and Nic Dowd reuniting, and Hendrix Lapierre moving up to 3C. Unfortunately, the new lines didn’t work.\n\nMultiple Capitals players finished below zero when it came to the plus-minus. However, Justin Sourdif registered the worst at -3.\n\nThe Capitals also struggled on special teams, failing to convert on their first three power-play opportunities. The team also gave up a Winnipeg goal on the penalty kill in the middle frame.\n\nThe Capitals finally got on the board late when Chychrun fired the puck past Hellebuyck on the 5-on-3.\n\nChychrun now has 12 goals on the season, while Alex Ovechkin’s assist moved him past Jaromir Jagr for 10th-most power-play points in NHL history.\n\nThis just wasn’t one of the better performances for the Capitals. The team couldn’t generate chances and was outplayed by Winnipeg.\n\nWhile the Capitals weren’t able to get going on the 5-on-5, the special teams didn’t help for the most part. The Capitals finally scored via Chychrun on the two-man advantage late in the game.\n\nThompson was put in a rough situation as he made 30 saves on the night. Though the five goals he gave up made all the difference (not his fault).\n\nThe 23-year-old made his NHL debut and was quite all right. Playing on the fourth line with Duhaime and Dowd, Trineyev tried to be physical and finished with 11:45 of ice time.\n\nJohn Cena Officially Retires: 6 Dream Matches We Never Got, Including Versus Goldberg\n\nSaturday Night’s Main Event Results: Highlights From John Cena Retirement Match & Grades\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden",

    "fullText": "PEORIA — Jean-Guy Trudel spelled out a clear message to his Peoria Rivermen team Saturday, and he didn't need any letters to do it.\n\nThe four-time SPHL Coach of the Year stripped the leadership letters off his players' jerseys before a rematch against Knoxville.\n\nThe Rivermen responded with a 5-0 victory that gave them a split in the weekend series before 3,989 who braved a winter storm to watch inside Carver Arena.\n\nThe Rivermen did it, technically, without a captain or two assistants.\n\nTrudel's decision to remove the \"C\" from veteran captain Alec Baer's jersey and the \"A\" off Garrett Devine's and Josh Martin's jerseys came overnight, after the Rivermen lost to Knoxville on Friday and slipped into sixth place. But it was something Trudel had been thinking about all week as he assessed his team amid four losses in six outings.\n\n\"Leadership has to be above and beyond, it has to be special,\" Trudel said. \"If you don't lead, you don't stay with the Peoria Rivermen. This is who we are, it's how we win, it's our culture to play fast, play heavy and play like this team means everything in the world to us.\n\n\"Leaders have to earn it every day. We're going to wait before we put any letters back on any uniforms. We're going to see who responds. We're going to see who steps up. It's a simple message: The Rivermen Way, or the highway.\"\n\nDevine responded with a two-goal, +4 game in which he imposed his will on the Ice Bears with a high-motor outing from start to finish.\n\nRivermen linemate and newcomer Khaden Henry? He merely notched a hat trick in his second game with the team, one of them a spectacular skill display. He produced 3 goals on 13 shots and a +4 rating in two games.\n\n\"We didn't really have any choice but to receive Jean-Guy Trudel's message,\" Devine said. \"It was a big game for us. A big inflection point. Early in a year you can reach a point where your season goes one of two ways, and I'm really proud of the way the guys responded and did a lot of the right things. The letter stuff is what it is. Guys know who the leaders are and it's everyone's job to lead.\n\n\"Everyone stepped up and played as a team effort, on the ice, off the ice, locker room, bench, everywhere. It's a matter of doing this every single night, every single guy.\n\n\"That's the biggest thing with our team, the way we're composed right now. Every single guy has to bring it, every single guy has to be a leader, every single guy has to do everything.\"\n\nThis story will be updated with more interviews and information.\n\nDave Eminian is the Journal Star sports columnist, and covers Bradley men's basketball, the Rivermen and Chiefs.

    "fullText": "Manel Kape closed out the last UFC fight of the ESPN era last night (Sat., Dec. 13, 2025) at UFC Vegas 112 LIVE on ESPN+ from inside UFC Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada, putting a vicious stop to flyweight contender Brandon Royval with a first-round TKO (punches).\n\nRoyval is as durable as they come, but some feared he’d get caught too often in a striking battle with Kape. It was paramount for Royval to be able to utilize his grappling, wild transitions, and submission threats to drag this fight into deep water. If “Raw Dawg” couldn’t keep Kape guessing it was going to be a long night.\n\nUnfortunately for Royval, Kape was dialed in from the opening bell and he was dictating the action all the way through. Kape eventually forced his way inside along the cage and landed a huge right hand that sent Royval crumbling to the ground. In less than a second Kape was on “Raw Dawg” again for another clean right followed by a few more shots. There was no doubt that Royval was out as the referee slid in for the stoppage, even though he quickly got back to his feet (albeit stumbling).\n\nIt was a great way to close out 2025 and a perfect knockout finish to end the ESPN era.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder saw its 16-game winning streak end in Saturday night’s 111-109 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe Thunder held a 49-46 lead at halftime, but were unable to hold off the Spurs, who had four players score 20 points or more.\n\n“When you play close games, you’re not going to win them all,” Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault said. “I thought we put ourselves in a tough position there, playing from behind down the stretch.”\n\nOklahoma City gave up 65 second-half points in Saturday’s loss. The Spurs made 13 3-pointers and had 40 points in the paint.\n\n“Sometimes it comes down to make or miss plays,” Daigneault said. “We made some good passes out of double teams and stuff like that, so I thought our offensive attacks were okay. We didn’t get a ton of stop down at the other end.”\n\nGuard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led Oklahoma City with 29 points on 12/23 shooting. He also added four rebounds and five assists but also had five turnovers. Daigneault said the Spurs did a good job defending Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\n“There was a lot of controllable stuff we can learn from that game that wasn’t where we’d like it to be,” Daigneault said.\n\nThe Thunder struggled from 3-point range, shooting 9/37 (24%) from behind the arc.\n\n“It wasn’t our sharpest night,” Daigneault said. “Certainly, our attacks weren’t as sharp as they’ve normally been.”\n\nIt was the first loss for the Thunder since a 121-119 defeat to the Portland Trail Blazers on Nov. 5.",

    "description": "Brandon Svaboda scored the go-ahead goal for Boston University men's ice hockey in the third period of Saturday's game.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON – Before the lights went out at Matthews Arena for the last time, they shined brightly on Boston University center Brandon Svoboda.\n\nThe sophomore from Pittsburgh scored two goals including the game-winner at 18:21 of the third to lift the Terriers to a 4-3 victory over Northeastern, on Saturday night. Svoboda’s fourth of the season was the final goal scored at Northeastern’s historic Matthews Arena.\n\nThe Terriers’ victory over the Huskies was the last sporting event played inside Matthews Arena, which officially opened its doors as Boston Arena in April of 1910.\n\n“I got a lucky bounce and I capitalized on it and put it in the back of the net,” said Svoboda. “Playing the last game ever in this building is pretty special and what was it, 1910 this place was built so it was pretty special being the last team playing in this building.\n\n“We are a young group and we are figuring it out so it was obviously a big deal to get a W in the last game in this arena.”\n\nBU improved to 9-8-1 and 6-3-0 in Hockey East going into the semester break while the No. 11 Huskies fell to 10-6-0 and 5-4-0 in the conference.\n\n“It was just a big win for us going into the semester break,” said BU coach Jay Pandolfo. “The first half has not been ideal for us so to finish it that way, to come back in the third period to win a hockey game in this environment, where this is their last home game here and they wanted to win and we found a way to pull it off.”\n\nNortheastern purchased the structure in 1979 and renamed it Matthews Arena three years later. The demolition of the old barn nestled between Mass. Ave and Gainsborough Street will begin in January and the new arena is scheduled to go online in September of 2028.\n\n“Having a new facility is definitely a big selling point,” said NU coach Jerry Keefe. “It is going to have all the amenities you need to develop players and I think this generation of recruits like the shiny and the new.”\n\nThe first Beanpot Tournament was played at Boston Arena in 1952, so it seemed appropriate that Northeastern would play its final game against a neighboring Beanpot opponent. BU played its home games at Boston Arena from 1918 to 1971 before moving into its new facility on Babcock Street.\n\nPandolfo enjoyed many Matthews moments both on the ice and behind the bench. Pandolfo also played in the final Beanpot game at the old Boston Garden.\n\n“I always enjoyed playing here that’s for sure,” Pandolfo said. “It was a fun place to play and I always enjoyed it and I enjoyed coaching there. It is a great environment and a special old building.\n\n“That’s the biggest attachment for me and that I just enjoyed it. My grandfather played at Northeastern, my mom’s dad and that makes it special as well. It was also Boston University’s home rink as well for a long time and that is a big reason we are here closing it out with Northeastern.”\n\nThe Huskies had some extra zip in their blades that created several scoring opportunities, all of which deftly handled by BU netminder Mikhail Yegorov.\n\nNU went up 1-0 on a power play goal by freshman center Jacob Mathieu at 11:28 of the first. Mathieu found an opening outside the BU crease and redirected Giacomo Martino’s wrister from the left circle for his fifth of the season.\n\nNU went up 2-0 at 14:36 when junior center Tyler Fukakusa finished a two-on-one break with his second goal of the season. BU got on the board when Svoboda netted a power play goal at 17:40, his third of the season.\n\n“We were playing fine but we just made some mistakes so to get out of that first period 2-1 was important no question about that,” said Pandolfo.\n\nBU tied the game 2-2 on sophomore center Sacha Boisvert’s second of the season at 13:38 of the second. NU went up 3-2 when sophomore left wing Joe Connor beat the buzzer at 19:59 with his sixth of the season. NU tied the game 3-3 on Kamil Bednarik tally at 18:02 of the third. Svoboda would score 19 seconds later to complete the comeback.\n\n“You give up a late goal at the end of the second period after a power play, that can really hurt you,” said Pandolfo. “But our guys were determined to come back.”",

    "description": "Head coach Brendon McCullum says England are unlikely to make changes to their batting line-up for the crucial third Ashes Test in Adelaide.",
    "fullText": "Head coach Brendon McCullum said England are unlikely to make changes to their batting line-up for the crucial third Ashes Test in Adelaide, which begins on Wednesday.\n\nEngland, 2-0 down after the first two Tests, must beat Australia at the Adelaide Oval to keep their hopes of regaining the Ashes alive.\n\nNumber three Ollie Pope and wicketkeeper Jamie Smith may have been candidates to be left out if England had considered making changes.\n\nBut asked if he anticipated fielding the usual top seven, McCullum said: \"I would have thought so.\n\n\"We've been in positions where we have made some mistakes, and that can happen at times. But for us to go on and win this series, it's not about throwing out what has been successful for us over the last few years. It's about having more conviction.\n\n\"Knee-jerk reactions and chopping and changing settled batting line-ups is not really our way.\"\n\nIt is unusual for McCullum to address the media before a Test, and he explained his appearance on Sunday was because \"we know where we are in the series\".\n\nIn wide-ranging comments, McCullum:\n\nleft the door open for spinner Shoaib Bashir and seamer Josh Tongue to play in Adelaide\n\nsaid any speculation that his job would be on the line if England lose this week \"does not really bother me\"\n\nexplained his previous comments about England being \"overprepared\" for their second-Test defeat in Brisbane\n\nrejected any suggestion his team go about things in a \"casual manner\".\n\nWith changes to the top seven now seemingly off the table, England could opt to refresh their bowling line-up.\n\nConditions in Adelaide, including the high temperatures forecast when the Test begins on Wednesday (23:30 GMT on Tuesday), could necessitate the inclusion of specialist spinner Bashir.\n\n'Noosa, Noosa, Noosa' - England's Ashes break ends\n\nEngland security guard accused of 'confrontation'\n\nAll-rounder Will Jacks was chosen ahead of Bashir in Brisbane, though captain Ben Stokes insisted Bashir remains England's first-choice spinner.\n\nThe 22-year-old was earmarked for this trip more than a year ago, but has not played a Test since July because of a broken finger and has figures of 2-266 from his two tour games in Australia.\n\nTongue would be the most likely candidate to come in if England want a new paceman, with Gus Atkinson possibly making way.\n\n\"We need to have a look at the conditions,\" McCullum told BBC Sport. \"We have a squad of 16 here, which in a five-Test series, we know we will have to call upon the majority if not all of those.\n\n\"We will work out what we think is the best option to be successful in these conditions.\"\n\nHeavy defeats on Ashes tours have often brought changes to England regimes.\n\nThis series was billed as a huge opportunity for England to win back the urn, yet the tourists are at risk of being out of the series at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nThough McCullum and Stokes are contracted to England until the end of the next home Ashes in 2027, their positions - along with that of director of cricket Rob Key - will come in for intense scrutiny if England are beaten in Adelaide.\n\nAsked if a loss would put his job under pressure, McCullum said: \"I don't know, but it doesn't really bother me, to be honest.\n\n\"I certainly don't coach to protect the job. I coach to get the best out of people and that's the same with the skipper. We both go about that in our same way with the same level of conviction and that won't be changing this week just because the prize is at its highest.\n\n\"I firmly believe that if we play our best cricket, we are a massive chance in this Test match. If we do that, then the narrative changes and the series momentum changes.\"\n\nHow much do you know about past Ashes games in Adelaide?\n\nIn the run-up to the second Test, England chose not to send players from the first Test to join a day-night England Lions game against a Prime Minister's XI in Canberra.\n\nThe tourists instead opted for five days of training in Brisbane which, in the aftermath of the Gabba defeat, McCullum claimed left them \"overprepared\".\n\nOn Sunday, the former New Zealand captain said he stood by his comments, but also explained he made them to draw attention away from the players.\n\n\"There's things that you say and things that you do - in the job you're in, sometimes it's better for the scrutiny to be on yourself,\" said McCullum.\n\n\"There is no perfect preparation. If there was and you could hit 4,000 balls to guarantee an average of 90, or bowl however many balls to guarantee 10 wickets, then we'll do it - don't worry. But that doesn't exist.\n\n\"Five intense days leading up to a Test match is not the best way to prepare. We'll be working out these next three days to make sure we get ourselves in the right frame of mind and skill level to be able to perform.\"\n\nEngland returned to training on Sunday following a break in the Queensland resort town of Noosa.\n\nTheir approach has often attracted criticism, in particular their off-field activities during this tour.\n\nOn Sunday they began their training session with intense fielding drills, which have been uncommon for England under Stokes and McCullum.\n\n\"I do feel like there's a feeling that we go about our work in a very casual manner, but it couldn't be further from the truth,\" added McCullum.\n\n\"The level of intensity with which we try to operate with and the hard edge we try to bring to the team, is all encompassing.

    "fullText": "It's a scene you would expect to see in Tokyo.\n\nBut the sound of bare feet padding, and bodies thudding on the mat of a sports hall in Belfast signals an unlikely first - the ancient Japanese tradition of sumo wrestling has landed in Northern Ireland.\n\nSumo Na hÉireann is thought to be the first sumo wrestling club on the island of Ireland and its members are keen to make their mark.\n\nAmong them is Toraigh Mallon, who believes she is Ireland's first female sumo wrestler.\n\nShe says sumo is \"definitely on the up,\" with \"new members coming along every week\".\n\nSumo Na hÉireann club founder Johnny Templeton said the growing interest comes hot on the heels of the professional Grand Sumo Tournament in London's Royal Albert Hall in October.\n\nUnlike professional sumo in Japan, where women are not allowed to compete, amateur sumo does have female competitions.\n\nMs Mallon is determined to break through to the top, and is training hard in preparation for the inaugural British Isles Sumo Wrestling Championship at Ulster University in January, where she expects a \"grudge match\" against her Norwegian counterpart.\n\nShe was drawn into the world of sumo by an advert on Instagram and has not looked back since.\n\n\"I would do anything to get out of the house, because I don't like sitting in, I like being active.\"\n\nFor Toraigh, it's training every night of the week, be that in the gym, boxing and in the dohyō (sumo ring) in preparation for her match in January.\n\nShe said she sees sumo wrestling taking off in Ireland.\n\n\"There's new people here every night, there's a new club in Dublin, it's on the up definitely,\" she added.\n\nIn the amateur games, size and weight doesn't matter just as much as it does in the professional world.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Mr Templeton said: \"In amateur competitions, which we compete in, there is weight classes, so you'll never have to fight someone outside of your weight class, unless you want to.\"\n\n\"The professionals you see on TV, there's no weight classes so they can get as big as they like,\" he said.\n\nMr Templeton said Sumo Na hÉireann came to be after he competed for Team GB in the world championships and in amateur competitions across the UK.\n\nHe got into sumo after competing in other types of martial arts and wrestling for most of his life and after having sumo success in the UK, that's when he decided to carry sumo over to Ireland.\n\nSumo Na hÉireann is just over a year old, and expanded to Dublin last month.\n\nMr Templeton believes sumo wrestling has found a home here in Ireland, and thinks sumo has some interesting similarities to an old Irish form of wrestling.\n\n\"The way sumo is the native, indigenous traditional wrestling of Japan, Ireland does have that as well, it's just that it's practice has been lost over the years.\"\n\nTraditional Irish wrestling is called collar-and-elbow wrestling.\n\n\"It is focused mostly on foot sweeps, and is a type of jacketed wrestling but the goal is very much the same as it is in sumo.\n\n\"The parallels are amazing,\" he added.\n\nRising sumo star Matt Wilson has been competing in the UK and has his eye on the world championships next year.\n\nSumo is his passion, and he said aside from the weekly bouts, he trains hard in the gym and keeps an eye on his diet.\n\n\"I used to eat loads to get my weight up so I could wrestle some of the heavier guys,\" he said.\n\nNow he keeps a \"maintenance weight\" so he is able to fight faster and still stay heavy.\n\nMr Wilson said he \"can definitely see sumo exploding\" in the UK and Ireland especially after the Grand Sumo Tournament in London.\n\nFrom leg stomps to drive away evil spirits, to throwing salt to purify the ring (or dohyō), and burying food as an offering, sumo wrestling is steeped in traditions and sumo wrestlers (or Rikishi), live highly-regimented lives.\n\nMost sumo wrestlers in Japan are required to live in communal sumo training stables, where every aspect of their daily lives - from diet to dress code - are dictated by traditions.\n\nYet while the ancient Japanese customs are acknowledged and respected at Sumo Na hÉireann, the focus is on the wrestling, and everyone is welcome.\n\nThe basic principle of sumo is that a match is decided by a fighter either being forced out of the circular dohyō (ring), or touching the ground inside the ring with any part of the body other than the soles of the feet.\n\nRitual, wrestling and Reddit: Grand Sumo meets internet fandom in London",

    "description": "Manel Kape wants a fight against new flyweight champion Joshua Van in 2026",
    "fullText": "Manel Kape made quite a statement that a title fight should be next after he flattened Brandon Royval with a devastating knockout in the first round in the main event at UFC Vegas 112.\n\nIt was a stunning performance from Kape, who showed no fear taking on a known finisher like Royval. After a few exchanges on the feet, Kape finally saw his opening to jump into a combination and it was a short right hand that blasted Royval and sent him crashing to the canvas.\n\nKape followed up with a few more punches and Royval was knocked unconscious momentarily until the next shot woke him up again. The referee rushed in to rescue Royval with the end coming at just 3:18 into the opening round.\n\nMANEL KAPE FINISHES BRANDON ROYVAL IN ROUND 1 😲 #UFCVegas113 pic.twitter.com/PpgXiNOmI3\n\n— ESPN MMA (@espnmma) December 14, 2025\n\nWith the win, Kape sent an emphatic message to new UFC flyweight champion Joshua Van after he claimed the belt at UFC 323 following a freak injury suffered by Alexandre Pantoja.\n\n“Now we’re talking,” Kape said looking directly into the camera. “Joshua Van, you thought Brandon Royval would do something. Now you have my belt. If I didn’t break my foot in July, I would be the champion now.\n\n“I’m here. Your daddy’s going to take your diapers. Be ready. Let’s fight in Houston in February. Just sign the contract. Just be ready. Nobody can f*cking deny the belt. I’m the f*cking best.”\n\nIn a battle of strikers, Royval actually set the tone early with a couple of nasty body kicks while Kape was the aggressor moving forward and trying to cut off the cage. Royval kept backing up and that was exactly what Kape wanted as he set up his combinations.\n\nFollowing a couple of exchanges, Kape finally saw the opening he wanted as he surged forward and trapped Royval against the cage as he unloaded a perfectly timed right hand that landed flush. Royval’s head snapped back and he crumbled to the canvas.\n\nKape continued firing shots until Royval went out with the referee jumping in to stop the contest. While Royval was seemingly woken up by one of the final punches landed, he was obviously very wobbly when attempting to get back to his feet after Kape delivered the knockout blow.\n\nAfter the win, Kape admitted he didn’t actually have a strategy that would lead to the finish but the knockout came just the same.\n\n“There is no game plan,” Kape said. “Brandon Royval just has to step into the cage and I will do the rest. This is beautiful violence. Where I touch, you guys die. Where I touch, coma. Where I touch, hospital I’m the most dangerous man in this division. I’m different. Just pay attention. I’m coming for my belt.”\n\nNow the UFC has a decision to make about what comes next for Van, especially if Pantoja is going to be sidelined for some time with the injury he suffered at UFC 323. Kape clearly made quite a statement with his win on Saturday and Tatsuro Taira did the same after he finished former champion Brandon Moreno.\n\nIt’s likely one of those two are going to get the next shot when Van is ready to defend his flyweight title in 2026.",

    "description": "The Bayern loanee's future in Hamburg is unkown",
    "fullText": "Daniel Peretz was surprised earlier this year when he was not named number one for newly promoted Hamburg when he joined them on loan. Instead he has been left on the bench for every league match and only played in three DFB-Pokal matches — including last week’s thriller against Holstein Kiel. He had back to back wins to begin his campaign, before coming up against Kiel. He was able to keep a cleansheet for 118 minutes, but conceded a late equalizer that forced penalty kicks. Peretz saved one penalty, but they ultimately fell 4-2.\n\nAfter the match Peretz was asked if he would terminate the loan in January when the transfer window opens. He told Sport Bild (as reported by @iMiaSanMia) that, “I expected to be number one. That hasn’t been the case so far. Of course, I’m not happy about it. I make no secret of that. I think no footballer is happy when he’s not playing. My goal remains to play every game. I came to HSV to play as many matches as possible. I’m accepting the situation now, taking it one game at a time, training hard, and trying to give my best every day – to make it as difficult as possible for the coaching staff.”\n\nBayern are unlikely to recall Peretz to Munich without a solid plan to loan him out for the rest of the season. The question remains: if no other Bundesliga team is willing to give Peretz playing time, would it be better for him to remain in Hamburg and fight for a spot or go to a lower division where he could have constant playing time? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",

    "fullText": "A Chelsea legend has declared that he wants to become manager of the club one day very soon, but he’s not yet retired.\n\nThe Blues have a lot of legends of course, and I am sure that there is many of them who would love the idea of managing the club one day, but not all of them will manage it.\n\nNot all of them will even go into coaching or become successful doing it, but if any current player can do it to a top standard then I have no doubt that Thiago Silva can. He’s a superbly intelligent player and has the right attitude and mentality to move into coaching, which is what he is planning to do once he retires from the game soon.\n\nSilva is still currently playing back in his native Brazil to see his career out, but he will soon be stepping up into a coaching role, and who would bet against him becoming Chelsea manager one day? Those are his intentions.\n\nThiago Silva claps the Chelsea fans\n\n‘When I become a coach, I’ve set myself a goal: To coach all the teams where I have played,’ Silva told L’Equipe.\n\nIt does seem like something that is destined to happen. When Silva says something, you know he means it and you know he aims to follow through on all his goals. His sons are in the Chelsea academy, imagine he manages them at the club one day soon? Don’t bet against that either.\n\nYou get a sense that Enzo Maresca and the Chelsea board are having a bit of a rift and that the two could part ways sooner rather than later, especially judging off the gaffers latest interview yesterday.\n\nIt came after Chelsea beat Everton 2-0 in what seemed to be a relief feeling for Maresca after Malo Gusto scored the decisive second goal for his side to go away with all three points.\n\nObviously it’s way too soon for Silva to jump in yet, but the way Chelsea go I am sure there will be an opportunity down the line in the not so distant future.",

Luckily, they’ll have their future Hall-of-Famer available for the game.\n\nLeBron James, who has been dealing with various ailments throughout the season, isn’t listed on the official injury report for the contest, so he should be good to go. On the season, James is averaging 16.5 points, 7.6 assists and 6.0 rebounds per performance in just eight appearances.\n\nBut, while James will be available for L.A. against Phoenix, a few other players won’t be. Austin Reaves, Maxi Kleber and Bronny James have all been ruled out of the game. Reaves, who has been a huge factor in L.A.'s early-season success, is expected to miss a week of action with a calf strain.\n\nMeanwhile, the Suns will be without Jalen Green and Isaiah Livers. Star guard Devin Booker is also listed as questionable for the contest.\n\nHeading into the game, the Lakers are fifth in the Western Conference standings with a 17-7 record while the Suns sit seventh at 14-11. Since they're in the same division, the two teams will play two more times this season after Sunday, including once later this month. They'll also play in late February.",

    "fullText": "A number of players are being touted as potential additions to Liverpool’s front line as the January window fast approaches.\n\nAntoine Semenyo and Yan Diomande are two of the names that are being constantly linked with a move to Merseyside but, whilst both are great players in their own right, neither are on the level of Salah.\n\nVery few players in fact are capable of reaching the level that Salah displayed last season, when the forward scored 34 goals and provided 23 assists for Liverpool.\n\nThe man who looks closest to that level currently in Europe is long-term Reds’ target Michael Olise.\n\nThe Frenchman has six goals and nine assists in just 13 appearances for Bayern Munich this season, but a reported price tag of €150 million (~£131m) complicates things.\n\nThat fee would exceed the club-record £125m Liverpool paid for Alexander Isak in the summer, a window in which the Reds broke their club record twice after bringing in Florian Wirtz a few weeks before Isak’s arrival.\n\nThe bar has been set high by Salah at Liverpool. Isak and Wirtz may be capable of picking up some of the responsibility in the Reds’ front line without Salah, but the addition of Olise would take Arne Slot’s side to a whole new level.\n\nOver the past year, the Frenchman ranks in the top percentile among Europe’s wingers for both assists and shot creating actions.\n\nThe 24-year-old plays 6.74 progressive passes per 90 minutes, has 5.18 progressive carries per 90 and completes 2.5 successful take-ons per 90.\n\nOn top of that he also takes 3.61 shots per 90 and averages 6.5 touches in the opposition penalty area.\n\nOlise would not only unlock Liverpool’s current forwards, he provides plenty of goal threat himself.\n\nHaving spent three seasons at Crystal Palace, Olise boasts Premier League experience and wouldn’t need to take time to adjust to English football like Wirtz has this season.\n\nIf that output were to continue if Olise made a Premier League return, he would look well worth the hefty price tag.\n\nThe Reds broke the bank last summer and so far it hasn’t yielded the results many were hoping for.\n\nLiverpool’s chances of retaining the Premier League title looked almost non-existent by the start of December and throwing more money at the situation is an approach many supporters will be cautious off.\n\nManchester United and Chelsea have proven over the last five years that splashing big money on players to add to an already struggling side does not always lead to success.\n\nA record-breaking deal for Olise represents a huge risk, but it could have a huge pay-off.\n\nSlot’s biggest problem this season has been chance creation. Isak and Hugo Ekitike are both known to be ruthless in front of goal, but a lack of consistent high-quality chances has meant they are perceived to be underperforming.\n\nOlise could be the man to finally get Liverpool’s forwards firing and his addition, although expensive, could be the catalyst that makes the Reds title challengers once again.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur are looking to preserve their unbeaten start to December when they take on Nottingham Forest at City Ground later today.\n\nThe mood in the Tottenham dressing room has shifted over the past couple of weeks, with December offering Thomas Frank’s side a renewed sense of belief.\n\nTottenham visit City Ground looking for a third consecutive win in all competitions and a fourth game without defeat (W2, D1).\n\nSpurs ended last month with three consecutive defeats in all competitions.\n\nHowever, they seem to have turned a corner after following up a 2-2 draw at Newcastle United with back-to-back wins over Brentford and Slavia Prague.\n\nThe 2-0 win against Brentford lifted Tottenham closer to the European places.\n\nThey’ll head into the game against Forest six points off fourth-placed Chelsea, and a win over the Tricky Trees will keep them within touching distance.\n\nTottenham’s recent form will take the sting off the fact that they started the weekend in the bottom half of the Premier League table.\n\nHowever, their away form is cause for concern as they take on a resurgent Forest side.\n\nTottenham have lost three of their last four games (D1) away from home, but at least they’ve scored at least twice in six of their seven trips this season.\n\nAfter watching his side put in a performance of complete domination in midweek, Frank will be forgiven for making only a couple of tweaks for the battle with Forest at City Ground.\n\nThe Danish manager will be wary of compromising his chances of putting together three consecutive wins for the first time since joining Spurs.\n\nThat should see Guglielmo Vicario retain his spot in goal as well as a familiar backline of Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, and Djed Spence.\n\nThe “very talented” Archie Gray is in line to start back-to-back Premier League games and a third in a row in all competitions after forcing his way into Frank’s plans.\n\nHe’ll likely be joined by Rodrigo Bentancur, who returns to the XI after sitting out the midweek game.\n\nRandal Kolo Muani should also return to the XI in place of Wilson Odobert, while Xavi Simons, Mohammed Kudus, and Richarlison reprise their roles.",

    "description": "Scientists are testing whether GLP-1 drugs can help to cut cravings for cigarettes, alcohol and opioids — as well as food.",
    "fullText": "Last April, neuroscientist Sue Grigson received an e-mail from a man detailing his years-long struggle to kick addiction — first to opioids, and then to the very medication meant to help him quit.\n\nThe man had stumbled on research by Grigson, suggesting that certain anti-obesity medications could help to reduce rats’ addiction to drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. He decided to try quitting again, this time while taking semaglutide, the blockbuster GLP-1 drug better known as Ozempic. “That’s when he wrote to me,” says Grigson, who works at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey. “He said that he was drug- and alcohol-free for the first time in his adult life.”\n\nStories like this have been spreading fast in the past few years, through online forums, weight-loss clinics and news headlines. They describe people taking diabetes and weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (also marketed as Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound) who find themselves suddenly able to shake long-standing addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. And now, clinical data are starting to back them up.\n\nEarlier this year, a team led by Christian Hendershot, a psychologist now at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, reported in a landmark randomized trial that weekly injections of semaglutide cut alcohol consumption1 — a key demonstration that GLP-1 drugs can alter addictive behaviour in people with a substance-use disorder. More than a dozen randomized clinical studies testing GLP-1 drugs for addiction are now under way worldwide, with some results expected in the next few months.\n\nNeuroscientists, meanwhile, are working out how the weight-loss drugs suppress addiction by acting on hormone receptors in brain regions that control craving, reward and motivation. They are finding that GLP-1 therapies help to blunt urges for alcohol, opioids, nicotine and cocaine through some of the same brain pathways that also quell hunger cues and overeating. “At the end of the day, the neurobiological system that is activated by rewarding substances — food, sex, drugs, rock and roll — it’s the same system,” says Roger McIntyre, a psychopharmacologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. And some researchers are testing whether, by influencing reward-related brain circuits, the drugs might help with dementia and depression as well.\n\nThe research is still in its early stages, scientists warn. “We first need to find out if it’s efficacious and safe,” says W. Kyle Simmons, a neuroimaging specialist at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, who is leading a GLP-1 trial for alcohol reduction.\n\nBut some researchers and physicians are excited. No truly new class of addiction medicine has won approval from regulators in decades, says Elisabet Jerlhag Holm, an addiction biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If GLP-1 drugs prove effective in bigger trials, she says, “it’s a revolution”.\n\nIt took some years for the current buzz around GLP-1 drugs in addiction medicine to build. Researchers originally developed them to control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes by mimicking the hormone GLP-1. Soon it became clear that the drugs could curb appetite and promote weight loss, too. They act on hormone receptors located in the pancreas and gut — where they help to regulate blood sugar and signal fullness — but also in key regions of the brain that control reward and motivation, dialling down the urge for tasty, calorie-laden food.\n\nYet her findings barely registered among addiction researchers, she says, and pharmaceutical companies showed no interest either. “I was quite alone for a long time,” says Jerlhag Holm.\n\nBut Lorenzo Leggio, a physician-scientist at the US National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, noticed the work. He had also been following clues that GLP-1 might influence addictive behaviour and, in 2015, joined forces with Jerlhag Holm to uncover the first evidence of a connection between the hormone and alcohol dependence in humans. The team found that a common variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene was linked to heavier drinking6.\n\nUsing post-mortem human brain tissue, Leggio’s lab later showed that people with alcohol-use disorder have elevated levels of GLP-1 receptors in key reward-related regions of the brain7. Leggio suspects that this reflects an adaptive response: alcohol dampens the body’s GLP-1 production, and so the brain boosts expression of the hormone’s receptors to preserve sensitivity to it in circuits that govern reward and motivation.\n\nThese results, together with a growing number of animal studies, solidified GLP-1’s connection to addictive behaviour. Yet it was not until May 2023 that the story spilled into the public eye. The Atlantic magazine published an article about people taking semaglutide who said their urge to smoke or drink had faded. ‘Did Scientists Accidentally Invent an Anti-addiction Drug?’ it was headlined. “That was definitely a turning point,” says Leggio, who suddenly found himself getting calls from journalists.\n\nThe first few rigorous trials, however, had largely disappointing results. A 2022 study in Denmark, led by psychiatrist Anders Fink-Jensen at the University of Copenhagen, found that weekly treatment with exenatide — a ‘first-generation’ GLP-1 compound used since 2005 to treat diabetes but never approved for weight loss — did not substantially reduce the number of heavy drinking days in people diagnosed with alcohol dependence8. A 2023 trial in Switzerland likewise found that dulaglutide, another older GLP-1 drug, did not help people to quit smoking9.\n\nBut other results suggested that the drugs might have an effect. In a trial10 involving 20 people with opioid-use disorder, led by Grigson and psychologist Scott Bunce, also at Pennsylvania State University, treatment with liraglutide — another first-generation GLP-1 drug — reduced opioid craving by roughly 40%. And when Fink-Jensen’s team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at the brains of people taking exenatide in their clinical trial, they saw muted activity in reward-related regions when the participants viewed images of alcoholic drinks8.\n\nBut the first-generation drugs tested in these preliminary studies are much less potent than agents such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. These second-generation compounds bind more tightly to the GLP-1 receptor, stay active in the body for longer and have shown greater benefits across a range of health conditions. So, could these latest drugs change the behaviour of people struggling with substance misuse?\n\nThat’s what researchers are now examining in a raft of clinical trials with hotly anticipated results. Fink-Jensen and his colleagues have already tested whether the high dose of semaglutide approved for weight loss can cut alcohol intake in 108 people with alcohol-use disorder and obesity, in a clinical trial that wrapped up earlier this year. He says the results should be published in early 2026.\n\nIn the United States, meanwhile, Leggio and Simmons are each leading independent but coordinated randomized trials testing injected semaglutide in moderate-to-heavy drinkers who meet the diagnostic criteria for problematic alcohol use. Leggio’s trial will involve 52 people and test the high-dose Wegovy form of the drug, whereas Simmons’s trial, involving 80 people, is testing the lower-dose Ozempic, typically prescribed for diabetes. And psychologist Joseph Schacht at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora has been running his own alcohol trial with the oral version of semaglutide (marketed as Rybelsus). By coordinating their efforts, the three teams hope to tease apart how differences in dose and delivery affect outcomes.\n\nSchacht says that the pills, although less potent than injections, could be more appealing to people with alcohol addiction, many of whom also have a history of using injectable drugs such as fentanyl. “They can be gun-shy around needles, because that is a cue related to injection drug use,” he says.\n\nIn all of these trials of semaglutide for alcohol dependence, the research teams are also using fMRI to capture before-and-after snapshots of the brain to show how the drug alters responses to alcohol-related prompts, such as drinks or photos. This could reveal whether and how the drug disrupts the brain’s drive for alcohol — the reward-seeking sense of ‘wanting’ that fuels addiction. The imaging results might also show brain activity patterns that are more common in people who benefit from GLP-1 therapy than in those who don’t. “It may give us a better understanding for whom the drug works best,” Simmons says.\n\nResearchers are already piecing together a picture of how GLP-1 drugs act on the brain’s reward system. They know from animal models that rewarding substances — alcohol, nicotine, opioids, food — activate similar neural circuitry. This links deep brain structures such as the ventral tegmental area, where neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine originate, to the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine signals arrive and register as pleasure. Normally, every sip, puff or hit sends a jolt of rewarding dopamine through this circuit, teaching the brain to want more and reinforcing addictive behaviour.\n\nGLP-1 receptors sit on neurons throughout this network and, when triggered, are thought to reduce the flow of dopamine and other chemical messages to make rewarding experiences feel less compelling. When drugs such as semaglutide mimic GLP-1, they blunt the dopamine response and the compulsion to repeat the addictive behaviour fades away.\n\nStress responses come into play as well, animal studies show. When drugs activate GLP-1 receptors in brain regions such as the amygdala, they help to mute the surge of stress hormones that accompany anxiety, withdrawal and craving. This dual action — calming both the urge and the unease — could help to explain why the therapies seem to reduce not only consumption but also relapse, at least in rodents.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03911-x\n\nHendershot, C.

    "description": "Rivian's autonomy chief James Philbin told Business Insider that the cost of lidar, a sensor that can be found in robotaxis, is no longer expensive.",
    "fullText": "For Rivian's chief of autonomy, the decision to put in lidar for the EV company's coming R2 SUV was obvious.\n\nJames Philbin, Rivian's VP of autonomy and AI, told Business Insider that the price of lidar has decreased significantly enough in recent years to be able to put the sensor inside a personally-owned, mass-production vehicle.\n\n\"It's been on this incredible cost curve, where 10 years ago, it would be just unimaginable that you could put a lidar on a consumer vehicle. And now it's getting into that price point, kind of in the range of a radar,\" Philbin said. Radar, a sensor that uses radio waves, is commonly seen in modern cars that have an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) or blind spot detection.\n\nLidar is a sensor that uses laser light to measure depth. While it's historically been used for topography, the sensor has gained more visibility in the automotive world with the advent of self-driving cars.\n\nMost notably, Waymo's robotaxis have multiple lidar sensors, including the spinning lidar on the roof of the vehicle. Waymo has said that lidar provides additional safety to the vehicle's AI driver.\n\nOn Thursday, Rivian announced a road map to fully autonomous driving, which includes building an in-house chip and installing a lidar sensor in the company's coming SUV, the R2.\n\nPhilbin, who previously worked at Zoox and Waymo, told Business Insider that lidar makes an autonomous system \"more robust\" and can help the company get to its self-driving goal \"faster.\"\n\n\"It's very affordable,\" he said. \"The performance it gives you for that cost is really amazing. And so to me, it's kind of a no-brainer that you would want more sensors and more modalities for something that's so safety critical.\"\n\nUsing lidar diverges from the strategy of Rivian's main EV competitor, Tesla, which has taken a strong stance on pursuing self-driving with cameras only.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk once called lidar an expensive \"crutch.\"\n\nIn the late 2000s, during the days of the Google Self-Driving Car Project, a single lidar unit could come with a five-figure price tag. Today, industry leaders say a similar unit could cost a few hundred dollars.\n\nRivian employees, including Philbin, did not disclose the cost of the lidar unit in the R2 when asked by Business Insider.\n\nR2 will first be launched without the sensor in early 2026. It's slated to be Rivian's cheapest car to date, with a starting price of $45,000. The company aims to launch an R2 with lidar in late 2026.\n\nWhen asked what the cost difference was to put a lidar in the R2, Philbin declined to comment but said that it was \"not a significant consideration.\"",

The loss of the studio, which has created iconic films ranging from Casablanca and Goodfellas to Batman and Harry Potter, likely means more job cuts and definitely means one less buyer of film and TV projects.\n\nInterviews with dozens of actors, producers and camera crews by the BBC reveal an industry attempting to weigh the lesser of two evils: control by a tech giant blamed for killing movie theatres (Netflix) or billionaires seen as too cosy with President Trump (Paramount).\n\n\"David Ellison is a right-wing billionaire Trumper,\" a camera assistant said of the Paramount Skydance CEO who is the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison. \"Netflix is much more historically inclined to not micromanage production.\"",

    "fullText": "The difference between a Billionaire and a Bankrupt Founder is rarely hard work. It is timing.\n\nIf you started a Crypto exchange in 2012, you are rich. If you started one in 2023, you are likely struggling.\nIf you sold Hand Sanitizer in 2019, you were weird. In 2020, you were a genius.\n\nMost aspiring entrepreneurs look for \"Business Ideas.\" Smart entrepreneurs look for \"Market Signals.\"\n\nThe internet is not just a communication network; it is a Global Consciousness. Every day, billions of people type their fears, desires, and problems into search bars and forums. This data stream contains the blueprint for the next Unicorn—if you know how to read it.\n\nThis guide will teach you the art of Trend Hacking: The scientific process of using AI to scan the global data-stream for \"rising waves\" before they hit the shore.\n\nWe will show you exactly how to use the Market Signal Analyzer to find your Blue Ocean, validate it for $0, and scale it before the competition even wakes up.\n\nEvery trend follows a mathematical curve known as the Gartner Hype Cycle, modified for the viral internet age. Understanding this curve is the difference between catching the wave and crashing.\n\nThe Market Signal Analyzer Advantage:\nMost free tools (Google Trends) only visualize Phase 3. By the time a line goes vertical on Google Trends, the market is saturated. The Signal Analyzer detects the \"Velocity of Discussion\" in Phase 1, giving you a 6-month head start.\n\nBefore you build, you must filter your ideas through the \"Triad of Profit.\" A valid business idea must pass all three filters.\n\nPeople pay to stop pain. They rarely pay for \"vitamins.\"\n\nMonopolies are hard to kill. You want fragmented, messy markets.\n\nHere is your Saturday Morning workflow. Follow this exactly to generate 5 valid ideas in 30 minutes.\n\nDon't just trust the keyword. Understand the driver.\n\nAsk: \"What are the biggest complaints about current solutions?\"\n\nYou have found a \"Bleeding Neck\" (Fines) in a \"Fragmented Market\" (New Law) with \"Wallet\" (Funded Startups). This is a million-dollar signal.\n\nLet's look at real-world examples of founders who used this methodology to win.\n\nThe biggest mistake founders make is building the product before selling it.\nOnce you have the Signal, run a \"Smoke Test.\"\n\nThe Market Signal Analyzer gives you the data foundation, but the Smoke Test gives you the truth.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to SaaS. If you are a content creator, this is your cheat code.\n\nIn 2025, 'Intuition' is a liability. Data is an asset.\nThe founders who win are not the \"Visionaries\" staring at the stars. They are the Scientists staring at the data.\n\nThey don't guess what the market wants. They measure it. They intercept the demand.\n\nYou don't need to be a genius to build a million-dollar business. You just need to be First. And to be first, you need the Signals.\n\nStop staring at a blank whiteboard. The answers are floating in the data stream right now. You just need the right net.\n\nYou have the blueprint.

    "fullText": "Marketing automation used to mean \"scheduling emails.\" In 2025, it means \"replacing the marketer.\"\n\nThe landscape has shifted. The goal is no longer to make your marketing team faster; the goal is to build a system that runs without them.\n\nThis is the age of the Autonomous Growth Engine.\n\nWe are witnessing the most significant shift in business economics since the Industrial Revolution. The \"Cost of Cognition\" is dropping to zero. Tasks that previously required expensive humans—writing strategy, editing video, analyzing data—can now be executed by autonomous agents for fractions of a cent.\n\nIf you are a founder, a CMO, or a growth hacker looking to dominate your niche without burning cash on headcount, this is your blueprint. We will break down exactly how to architect a \"Zero-Touch\" marketing strategy that operates 24/7/365.\n\nTo understand where we are going, we must understand why the old model is dead.\n\nIn 2021, the standard advice for a Series A startup was:\n\nThis created massive OpEx (Operating Expense) bloat. When the market turned, these startups died. They couldn't move fast enough because every decision required a meeting.\n\nToday, a \"One-Person Unicorn\" can out-execute a 50-person team.\n\nThe competitive advantage of the next decade is not \"Talent.\" It is \"Architecture.\" Can you architect a system that scales infinitely?\n\nJust like self-driving cars, marketing automation has levels. Most companies are stuck at Level 2.\n\nThis guide is about moving you from Level 2 to Level 3 immediately.\n\nTo build a Level 3 system, you need three core engines working in harmony. We call this the \"Trinity of Autonomy.\"\n\nThe Goal: Dominate \"Share of Voice\" without typing.\n\nTotal Human Time: 5 Minutes (Review & Approve).\nTotal Output: 1 Pillar Page + 10 Social Assets.\n\nThe Goal: Broadcast-quality production at \"TikTok Speed.\"\n\nVideo is the highest-converting asset class, but traditionally the hardest to automate. Not anymore.\n\nAn AI Video Agent doesn't just \"make video\"; it engineers retention.\n\nThe Result: You can test 20 different video angles in a single day. A human team would take a month to shoot one concept.\n\nThe Goal: Turn traffic into revenue without sales calls.\n\nTraffic is vanity. Revenue is sanity. An autonomous system doesn't just drive clicks; it ensures they buy.\n\nThe biggest reason landing pages fail is \"The Maker's Blind Spot.\" You love your product, so you assume everyone else gets it. They don't.\n\nThis creates a \"Self-Healing Funnel.\" The system identifies leaks and proposes patches before you bleed revenue.\n\nYou have the theory. Here is exactly what to do, week by week.\n\nDon't turn on ads yet. You need Authority.\n\nLet's look at the hard numbers. This is what you save by moving to Vect AI.\n\nThis is not a \"saving.\" This is a War Chest. You can take that $359k and pour it into paid acquisition, product development, or just profit.\n\nThe future belongs to the founders who leverage leverage.\n\nArchimedes said, \"Give me a lever long enough, and I shall move the world.\"\nIn 2025, AI is the lever.\n\nYou don't need a team. You need a system. You don't need overhead. You need output.\n\nThe tools are here. The playbook is open. The only question is: Will you hire people, or will you hire the OS?\n\nYou have the blueprint. Now you need the engine. Launch the AI agent for \"Marketing Video Ad\" and get results in minutes.",

    "description": "Does today's Wordle have you stumped? Here are some hints and the answer.",
    "fullText": "Hey, there! We hope you're having a great weekend. If you're looking for a little help with today's Wordle, you've certainly found it. Here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Sunday's puzzle (#1,639).\n\nIt may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that as well.\n\nWordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that debuted in 2021. There is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.\n\nWordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that shows how they fare each day in a spoiler-free way. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.\n\nThe New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.\n\nTo start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard. However, you can still use those letters in subsequent guesses.\n\nYou'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.\n\nWordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets and Discord. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.\n\nIf you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,600 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.\n\nIn addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.\n\nBefore today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed:\n\nYesterday's Wordle answer for Saturday, December 13 — MISER\n\nEvery day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word.\n\nIn case you still haven't quite figured it out by that point, we'll then provide the first letter of the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle.\n\nThis should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly. Spoilers are ahead.\n\nHere is a hint for today's Wordle answer:\n\nWhat a batting coach might help a baseball player improve.\n\nThere are no repeated letters in today's Wordle answer.\n\nThe first letter of today's Wordle answer is S.\n\nThis is your final warning before we reveal today's Wordle answer. No take-backs.\n\nDon't blame us if you happen to scroll too far and accidentally spoil the game for yourself.\n\nWhat is today’s Wordle? Today's Wordle answer is...\n\nNot to worry if you didn't figure out today's Wordle word. If you made it this far down the page, hopefully you at least kept your streak going. And, hey: there's always another game tomorrow.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Hundreds of police officers were scouring the Brown University campus along with nearby neighborhoods and poring over video in the hunt for a shooter who opened fire in a classroom, killing two people and wounding nine others.\n\nThe search stretched late into the night, well after the shooting erupted Saturday afternoon in the engineering building of the Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island, during final exams.\n\nSurveillance video released by police shows the suspect, dressed in black, calmly walking away from the scene. His face is not visible and investigators said it wasn't clear whether the suspect is a student.\n\nThe suspect was last seen leaving the engineering building and some witnesses told police the suspect, who could be in his 30s, may have been wearing a camouflage mask, Providence Police Deputy Chief Timothy O’Hara said.\n\nUniversity President Christina Paxson said she was told 10 people who were shot were students. Another person was injured by fragments from the shooting but it was not clear if the victim was a student, she said.\n\nThe search for the shooter paralyzed the campus, the nearby neighborhoods filled with stately brick homes and the downtown in Rhode Island's capital city. Streets normally bustling with activity on weekends were eerily quiet.\n\nStudents sheltered in place for hours into the night. Officers in tactical gear led students out of some campus buildings and into a fitness center where they waited. Others arrived at the shelter on buses without jackets or any belongings.\n\nMayor advised people to stay home\n\nInvestigators were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom. Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said.\n\nHe encouraged people living near the campus to stay inside or not return home until a shelter-in-place order was lifted.\n\n“The Brown community’s heart is breaking and Providence’s heart is breaking along with it,” Smiley said.\n\nAuthorities believe the shooter used a handgun, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Dan McKee vowed that all resources were being deployed to catch the suspect. Rhode Island has some of the strictest gun laws in the U.S.\n\nNine people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island Hospital, where one was in critical condition. Six required intensive care but were not getting worse and two were stable, hospital spokesperson Kelly Brennan said.\n\nExams were underway during shooting\n\nEngineering design exams were underway when the shooting occurred in the Barus & Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department. The building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices, according to the university’s website.\n\nEmma Ferraro, a chemical engineering student, was in the building’s lobby working on a final project when she heard loud pops coming from the east side. Once she realized they were gunshots, she darted for the door and ran to a nearby building where she sheltered for several hours.\n\nFormer ‘Survivor’ contestant just left the building\n\nEva Erickson, a doctoral candidate who was the runner-up earlier this year on the CBS reality competition show “Survivor,” said she left her lab in the engineering building 15 minutes before shots rang out.\n\nThe engineering and thermal science student shared candid moments on “Survivor” as the show’s first openly autistic contestant. She was locked down in the campus gym following the shooting and shared on social media that the only other member of her lab who was present was safely evacuated.\n\nBrown senior biochemistry student Alex Bruce was working on a final research project in his dorm directly across the street from the building when he heard sirens outside.\n\n“I’m just in here shaking,” he said, watching through the window as armed officers surrounded his dorm.\n\nStudents in a nearby lab turned off the lights and hid under desks after receiving an alert about the shooting, said Chiangheng Chien, a doctoral student in engineering who was about a block away from the scene.\n\nMari Camara, 20, a junior from New York City, was coming out of the library and rushed inside a taqueria to seek shelter. She spent more than three hours there, texting friends while police searched the campus.\n\n“Everyone is the same as me, shocked and terrified that something like this happened,” she said.\n\nBrown, the seventh oldest higher education institution in the U.S., is one of the nation’s most prestigious colleges with roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students. Tuition, housing and other fees run to nearly $100,000 per year, according to the university.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are barely moving, refusing to react to the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.13%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.53%.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nDiscover 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rates.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nWant to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025? Here's what to do.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how today's interest rates would affect your monthly mortgage payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You also have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues, if applicable. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped with those of the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDig deeper into 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to get an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nFirst of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\n\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\n\nWhich is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.13% right now. But keep in mind that mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect mortgage interest rates to significantly drop before the end of the year. They may inch down here or there, but they probably won't plummet.\n\nOverall, mortgage rates have dropped gradually. The 30-year fixed rate is still below where it was one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nWith mortgage rates hovering above 6%, is now a good time to refinance your mortgage? Learn what factors to consider when deciding if you should refinance.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.",

    "fullText": "Van Giesen Street was under about two feet of water Saturday morning as the Yakima River overflowed its banks and surged into businesses and homes.\n\nIt rose to the level considered major flood stage — 16 feet at the Kiona gauge near Benton City — at 3 a.m. Saturday.\n\nVan Giesen was closed to both eastbound and westbound traffic between South 38th Avenue in West Richland and Highway 240 in Richland by 10:30 p.m. Friday, according to a Washington state Department of Transportation official.\n\nEarlier at least one lane of the roadway had been underwater and closed to traffic.\n\nThe water was forecast to drop to just below 16 feet by Saturday evening.\n\nThe Yakima River has not been this high near the Tri-Cities since the February 1996 flood, when the river reached nearly 21 feet at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kiona gauge, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.\n\nThe flooding water was flowing into Richland to the west of the bypass highway in the Van Giesen Street area Saturday morning.\n\nAt the Richland Riders Club, a stream of pickups hauling horse trailers carrying their animals to safety were pulling out of the equestrian boarding and riding facility on Van Giesen Street in Richland before noon Saturday.\n\nEarlier Saturday morning there was just a trickle at the club, but that rose to about three feet before noon.\n\nAt the Buckskin Golf Course in Richland, golfers played until dark Friday as owner Jeff Marcum kept an eye on nearby pastures that flood before water reaches his courses.\n\nAt 9 p.m., he grew concerned and started moving golf carts out of cart sheds and barely beat the rising water.\n\n“I was still chasing my tail about three in the morning,” he said.\n\nWater covered the entire course Saturday morning, including the lawn out front and the driving range, and had reached the interior of the pro shop.\n\nThis was the first year since he built the business in 1998 on Bronco Lane not far from the Columbia Basin Racquet Club in Richland that flooding has crossed Bronco Lane to the west, he said.\n\nIt’s the first time his driving range has been underwater and that he has had water in his buildings, he said.\n\n“We got a whopper this time,” he said.\n\nHe was watching the water level on a stake he pounded into the ground and the water was continuing to rise just before noon, he said.\n\nOnce the water starts to drop, it goes down quickly, he said. He’s hoping to reopen by Christmas.\n\nThe Yakima River is expected to drop to just over 11 feet at the Kiona gauge by Tuesday, but then to start to rise again. It could crest at 13.5 feet Friday morning, considered minor flood stage, according to early predictions by the National Weather Service.\n\nFlooding of rivers and streams in the Mid-Columbia was caused by a strong atmospheric river that dumped rain in the Cascade Mountains early in the week, melting snow and swelling rivers.\n\nAnother atmospheric river is expected to hit Washington and Oregon Monday. It is not forecast to be as strong or as warm. Heavy snow is expected in the Cascade Mountains.",

    "fullText": "DOUANKARA, Mauritania (AP) — The girl lay in a makeshift health clinic, her eyes glazed over and her mouth open, flies resting on her lips. Her chest barely moved. Drops of fevered sweat trickled down her forehead as medical workers hurried around her, attaching an IV drip.\n\nIt was the last moment to save her life, said Bethsabee Djoman Elidje, the women's health manager, who led the clinic's effort as the heart monitor beeped rapidly. The girl had an infection after a sexual assault, Elidje said, and had been in shock, untreated, for days.\n\nHer family said the 14-year-old had been raped by Russian fighters who burst into their tent in Mali two weeks earlier. The Russians were members of Africa Corps, a new military unit under Russia's defense ministry that replaced the Wagner mercenary group six months ago.\n\nMen, women and children have been sexually assaulted by all sides during Mali's decade-long conflict, the U.N. and aid workers say, with reports of gang rape and sexual slavery. But the real toll is hidden by a veil of shame that makes it difficult for women from conservative, patriarchal societies to seek help.\n\nThe silence that nearly killed the 14-year-old also hurts efforts to hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe AP learned of the alleged rape and four other alleged cases of sexual violence blamed on Africa Corps fighters, commonly described by Malians as the “white men,” while interviewing dozens of refugees at the border about other abuses such as beheadings and abductions.\n\nOther combatants in Mali have been blamed for sexual assaults. The head of a women’s health clinic in the Mopti area told the AP it had treated 28 women in the last six months who said they had been assaulted by militants with the al-Qaida affiliated JNIM, the most powerful armed group in Mali.\n\nThe silence among Malian refugees has been striking.\n\nIn eastern Congo, which for decades has faced violence from dozens of armed groups, “we didn’t have to look for people,” said Mirjam Molenaar, the medical team leader in the border area for Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, who was stationed there last year. The women \"came in huge numbers.”\n\nIt's different here, she said: “People undergo these things and they live with it, and it shows in post-traumatic stress.\"\n\nThe aunt of the 14-year-old girl said the Africa Corps fighters marched everyone outside at gunpoint. The family couldn't understand what they wanted. The men made them watch as they tied up the girl’s uncle and cut off his head.\n\nThen two of the men took the 14-year-old into the tent as she tried to defend herself, and raped her. The family waited outside, unable to move.\n\n“We were so scared that we were not even able to scream anymore,” the aunt recalled, as her mother sobbed quietly next to her. She, like other women, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, and the AP does not name victims of rape unless they agree to be named.\n\nThe girl emerged over a half-hour later, looking terrified. Then she saw her uncle's body and screamed. She fainted. When she woke up, she had the eyes of someone “who was no longer there,” the aunt said.\n\nThe next morning, JNIM militants came and ordered the family to leave. They piled onto a donkey cart and set off toward the border. At any sound, they hid in the bushes, holding their breath.\n\nThe girl's condition deteriorated during the three-day journey. When they arrived in Mauritania, she collapsed.\n\nThe AP came across her lying on the ground in the courtyard of a local family. Her family said they had not taken her to a clinic because they had no money.\n\n“If you have nothing, how can you bring someone to a doctor?” the girl’s grandmother said between sobs. The AP took the family to a free clinic run by MSF. A doctor said the girl had signs of being raped.\n\nThe clinic had been functioning for barely a month and had seen three survivors of sexual violence, manager Elidje said.\n\n“We are convinced that there are many cases like this,\" she said. \"But so far, very few patients come forward to seek treatment because it’s still a taboo subject here. It really takes time and patience for these women to open up and confide in someone so they can receive care. They only come when things have already become complicated, like the case we saw today.”\n\nAs Elidje tried to save the girl's life, she asked the family to describe the incident. She did not speak Arabic and asked the local nurse to find out how many men carried out the assault. But the nurse was too ashamed to ask.\n\nScratch marks are part of story she could not tell\n\nThousands of new refugees from Mali, mostly women and children, have settled just inside Mauritania in recent weeks, in shelters made of fabric and branches. The nearest refugee camp is full, complicating efforts to treat and report sexual assaults.\n\nTwo recently arrived women discreetly pulled AP journalists aside, adjusting scarves over their faces. They said they had arrived a week ago after armed white men came to their village.\n\n“They took everything from us. They burned our houses. They killed our husbands,” one said. “But that’s not all they did. They tried to rape us.”\n\nThe men entered the house where she was by herself and undressed her, she said, adding that she defended herself “by the grace of Allah.”\n\nAs she spoke, the second woman started crying and trembling. She had scratch marks on her neck. She was not capable of telling her story.\n\n“We are still terrified by what we went through,” she said.\n\nSeparately, a third woman said that what the white men did to her in Mali last month when she was alone at home “stays between God and me.”\n\nA fourth said she watched several armed white men drag her 18-year-old daughter into their house. She fled and has not seen her daughter again.\n\nThe women declined the suggestion to speak with aid workers, some of whom are locals. They said they were not ready to talk about it with anyone else.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to questions, but an information agency that the U.S. State Department has called part of the “Kremlin’s disinformation campaign” called the AP’s investigation into Africa Corps fake news.\n\nWagner has a legacy of sexual abuse\n\nAllegations of rapes and other sexual assaults were already occurring before Wagner transformed into Africa Corps.\n\nOne refugee told the AP she witnessed a mass rape in her village in March 2024.\n\n“The Wagner group burned seven men alive in front of us with gasoline.” she said. Then they gathered the women and raped them, she said, including her 70-year-old mother.\n\n“After my mother was raped, she couldn’t bear to live,” she said. Her mother died a month later.\n\nIn the worst-known case of sexual assault involving Russian fighters in Africa, the U.N. in a 2023 report said at least 58 women and girls had been raped or sexually assaulted in an attack on Moura village by Malian troops and others that witnesses described as “armed white men.\"\n\nIn response, Mali’s government expelled the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Since then, gathering accurate data on the ground about conflict-related sexual violence has become nearly impossible.\n\nThe AP interviewed five of the women from Moura, who now stay in a displacement camp. They said they had been blindfolded and raped for hours by several men.\n\nThree of the women said they hadn't spoken about it to anyone apart from aid workers. The other two dared to tell their husbands, months later.\n\n“I kept silent with my family for fear of being rejected or looked at differently. It’s shameful,” one said.\n\nThe 14-year-old whose family fled to Mauritania is recovering. She said she cannot remember anything since the attack. Her family and MSF said she is speaking to a psychiatrist — one of just six working in the country.\n\nAid workers are worried about others who never say a thing.\n\n“It seems that conflict over the years gets worse and worse and worse. There is less regard for human life, whether it’s men, women or children,” said MSF’s Molenaar, and broke into tears. “It’s a battle.”\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "fullText": "Joe’s Crab Shack was never as big as Red Lobster or one of the other chains, but it was a common enough site for folks through the years.\n\nUnfortunately, it might not have been a common enough stop. Because, as well known as the seafood chain was, it’s footprint of nearly 150 restaurants across the country is now down to less than 20.\n\nIn fact, Tasting Table reported that the company’s website currently shows just 15 active restaurants.\n\nSo, how did things get so bad for Joe’s?\n\nWell, Tasting Table reported that the chain actually began to struggle back in the mid-2010s due to the increase in cost of seafood. That came while its sales began decreasing, and at least some of that was self-inflicted because Tasting Table noted that as well known as Joe’s was, it actually rated it as one of the worst seafood chains in business.\n\nThe outlet said lease expirations also hit Joe’s hard, particularly in 2017, when the chain dropped from 112 locations to 70 from June to August. That number was down to 30 last year, and now … again, just 15.\n\nSo, for fans of Joe’s, that is obviously pretty concerning news.\n\nJoe’s was founded in 1991, according to Tasting Table, and was sold in 1994 to Landry’s Inc. JCS Holdings, which became Ignite Restaurant Group, bought Joe’s in 2006, and Landry’s bought it again in 2017.\n\nIf things continue to go downhill at the rate they have, though, there may be nothing left for Landry’s to sell this time around.",

    "fullText": "Jalen Brunson's first 40-point game of the year couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nThe All-Star point guard dropped a season-high on Saturday night to lead the Knicks over the Orlando Magic and advance to the NBA Cup Championship on Tuesday night in Las Vegas.\n\nBrunson's scoring outburst came on 16-of-27 shooting (59.3 percent), despite going 2-of-5 from three-point land and only making six free throws. He also added in eight assists, four rebounds, and a steal over 39 minutes in the 132-120 win.\n\nAfter the victory, Brunson spoke with the NBA on Prime crew about his performance and how his game continues to improve, especially on the big stages.\n\n\"I think the way we've been playing, I've been able to get a couple more catch and shoots. I have a lot of confidence in my shot,\" Brunson said. \"I work way too hard not to be confident. Sometimes it's going to go in, and when it's going in I'm just going to keep firing them.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old was then asked by former two-time MVP Steve Nash about his \"touch around the rim\" and how that keeps getting better over the course of his career.\n\n\"It's something I had to learn,\" Brunson said. \"Obviously I'm not the tallest and I'm not jumping over people... My game's unique. I play off balance. I'm on balance, but most people wouldn't be. That's the stuff I work on, just be deceiving. I've done it for a long time and it keeps getting better and better like you said.\"\n\nBrunson's previous season-high in scoring was 37 points, which he's had twice this year (against the Heat on Oct. 26 and vs. the Bucks on Nov. 28). He's now averaging 28.3 points per game over 22 contests and has scored 30-plus points in four consecutive games.\n\nNew York, winners of five straight games, will need Brunson to continue playing with that confidence to keep their streak going on Tuesday night in the NBA Cup Championship against the winner of the Thunder-Spurs semifinal game.\n\n\"I work way too hard not to be confident ... my game is unique.\"\n\nJalen Brunson tells the crew about the parts of his game that keep getting better. pic.twitter.com/D83qzUnMmF\n\n— NBA on Prime (@NBAonPrime) December 14, 2025",

    "fullText": "WWE Saturday Night’s Main Event Results (Dec. 13, 2025)\n\nAJ Styles & Dragon Lee vs. Je’Von Evans & Champion Leon Slater\n\nTonight at WWE’s Saturday Night’s Main Event, the incomparable career of pro wrestling icon John Cena comes to a ceremonious end.\n\nIn the evening’s main event, the future WWE Hall of Famer will take on two-time World Heavyweight champion Gunther in his retirement match. However, the card inside the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, will also include a few other notable matchups.\n\nWWE champion Cody Rhodes will face his NXT counterpart Oba Femi. Women’s division legend Bayley will take on star prospect Sol Ruca, and the current World Tag Team champs, AJ Styles and Dragon Lee, will face NXT’s Je’Von Evans and TNA X-Division title holder Leon Slater.\n\nBelow you can find all the night’s results and the best highlights from each match.\n\nRhodes and Femi delivered an entertaining match, and one of the biggest takeaways was how over the NXT star is that the crowd was split for this one. Unfortunately, after a good start to the show, it ended in disqualification due to interference from Drew McIntyre. That terrible end to the match drops the grade from a B+ to B-.\n\nWinner: Rhodes vs. Femi ends in disqualification after interference from Drew McIntyre\n\nLISTEN TO THOSE OBA CHANTS!!! 🔊#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/4FvMQYpcGu\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nOBA FEMI TAKES CONTROL AGAINST CODY RHODES!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/emPKUGRb49\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nWHAT A SPINEBUSTER 🔥🔥#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/tFXYc9jOfv\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nOBA LAUNCHES INTO CODY WITH AN UPPERCUT OVER THE ANNOUNCE TABLE!!#SNME\n\n pic.twitter.com/e2O6MN8mcX\n\n— WrestlePurists (@WrestlePurists) December 14, 2025\n\nDrew McIntyre spoiled the fun, but Oba Femi has no mercy.

    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the iconic career of WWE legend John Cena will get a ceremonious end. His match with Gunther will conclude a year-long retirement tour where he took part in many entertaining matchups. However, during the tour and throughout his career, there were several dream matchups that wrestling fans missed out on.\n\nWith his career officially over, we look at six matches wrestling fans never got during John Cena’s incomparable career.\n\nDespite being on the roster together during both of Drew McIntyre’s two stints in WWE, he never faced Cena. He was also a popular pick to get a match with the legend during his 2025 tour. Yet, the stars never aligned, and the future Hall of Famer never got to face the current and best version of the “Scottish Psycho.”\n\nLA Knight nearly got his opportunity to face Cena, but came up just short to Gunther in the “Last Time is Now Tournament” final. It would have made sense for Knight to face Cena and win as a passing of the torch moment. The former United States champion would have also been a good opponent option during Cena’s short heel run. Alas, it never happened.\n\nCena wasn’t a star during Bill Goldberg’s first run in WWE, but he was an icon when he made his surprise return in the late 2010s. A dream match between them at WrestleMania could have been epic as the two powerhouses and wrestling greats went toe-to-toe in a match few would have expected. Yet, the company chose to have the former WCW champion focus on a long feud with Brock Lesnar instead of a matchup with John Cena.\n\nJey Uso eliminated John Cena in this year’s Royal Rumble. There were rumblings about a match between the two after that, but it never happened. A clash between the two would have been a lot of fun since they are two of the most beloved characters in WWE right now. Instead, Uso was busy in the World Heavyweight title picture for much of 2025.\n\nTo many wrestling fans, Japanese icon Kazuchika Okada is seen as NJPW’s version of Cena. That is why the two facing off is a unique dream match some fans hoped to see. However, when Okada chose to sign with AEW in March of last year, it killed any chance of that matchup ever happening.\n\nRic Flair has faced many elite stars from multiple generations. However, John Cena was not one of the. The idea of the long-time leader for most world title reigns facing the man who would eventually beat his record could have been interesting, but they never went toe-to-toe in that short period during the end of Flair’s run as an active competitor in WWE.\n\nShane McMahon, surprisingly, got to face many WWE legends during his part-time run wrestling in his father’s company. Yet, despite getting huge matchups with all-time greats like The Undertaker, Steve Austin, and The Rock, McMahon never got a one-on-one match with Cena. The bout probably would have been a lot of fun, especially the build-up to the unexpected bout.\n\nSaturday Night’s Main Event Results: Highlights From John Cena Retirement Match & Grades\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden\n\nMLB Free Agency Predictions: Projecting Landing Spots for Top 5 MLB Free Agents Right Now",

    "fullText": "The Jacksonville Jaguars have a chance to make history since 2017 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis season has seen a close race in the AFC South, mainly between the Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, and Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFor the Jaguars, they had an eventual season, they also lost their second overall draft pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, Travis Hunter, to a season ending knee injury after only seven games, but beating the Kansas City Chiefs on an improbable scramble by Trevor Lawrence in the fourth quarter, and are currently on a four-game winning streak, with the last two wins coming over division rivals while leading the South.\n\nOn Sunday, the team will look to continue its momentum when it hosts the New York Jets, who are 3-10 and in the running for the first draft pick in the 2026 draft, which will feature the likes of Heisman trophy winner Fernando Mendoza.\n\nWith a win, it will be the first time the team has reached 10 wins in a season since 2017, when they made a run to the AFC conference championship game before losing to the New England Patriots, 24-20, with a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nObviously, those teams are complete opposites, which emphasizes just how long it has been for the Jaguars to have a solid season with playoff aspirations. Trevor Lawrence is hoping to lead the team to their second playoff appearance as the starting quarterback.\n\nBased on how things currently stand, the last three games for the Jaguars after Sunday are winnable, with one more game against the Tennessee Titans, who have struggled in Cam Ward's first year, and the Colts, who have recently turned to a 44-year-old Philip Rivers to take over as their starting quarterback.\n\nThe only game they may not be favored in is the Week 16 showdown versus Bo Nix and the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium.",

    "fullText": "As Fernando Mendoza put the finishing touches on a Heisman Trophy-winning season, he signed an NIL deal with adidas. Shortly after he won college football’s highest honor, the brand paid tribute.\n\nAdidas released a video honoring Mendoza after he won the Heisman on Saturday night. The brand paid homage to his viral quote following the Big Ten Championship when the IU quarterback told FOX Sports’ Jenny Taft, “The Hoosiers are flippin’ champs.”\n\nThroughout the year, Mendoza not only became one of the biggest stars on the field, but one of the top names in the sport. He has a $2.6 million On3 NIL Valuation as Indiana soon prepares for the College Football Playoff as the No. 1 seed.\n\n@IndianaFootballpic.twitter.com/xafU0DhsLC\n\n— adidas US Football (@adidasFballUS) December 14, 2025\n\nJust before IU took on Ohio State in Indianapolis, Mendoza announced his high-profile NIL deal with adidas. He is the latest college football star to partner with the Three Stripes, joining Ohio State receiver Jeremiah Smith and Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola, among others.\n\n“Excited to share that I’ve accepted an opportunity to join adidas!” Mendoza wrote in a LinkedIn post. “I’m very grateful for everyone who has supported me along the way and excited to bring my passion for sport, leadership, and work ethic to the Three Stripes. Let’s get to work.”\n\nMendoza led the nation with 33 touchdown passes this year while completing 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards, to just six interceptions. Additionally, his $2.6 million On3 NIL Valuation ranks No. 5 in college football and No. 7 in the On3 NIL 100, the first of its kind and defacto NIL ranking of the top 100 high school and college athletes ranked by their On3 NIL Valuation.\n\nFernando Mendoza beat out Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia for the award, garnering 643 first-place votes and 2,362 points. Pavia got 189 first-place votes and 1,435 points. It’s the latest chapter in a special season for the former Cal star, who helped lead Indiana to its first outright Big Ten title since 1945.\n\nAfter the announcement, Mendoza delivered a passionate speech. As he wrapped, he had a message for young athletes who think they’re not getting enough attention or are ranked high enough.\n\n“The truth is, you don’t need the most stars, hype or rankings,” Mendoza said. “You just need discipline, heart and people who believe in you. And you need to believe in your own abilities. I hope this moment shows you that chasing your dreams are worth it, no matter how big or impossible they seem.”",

    "title": "Online Piracy Can Boost Box Office Revenue, Study Suggests",
    "description": "A new academic study counterintuitively concludes that online piracy can boost box office revenue for some films.",
    "fullText": "The general belief in Hollywood is that piracy causes billions of dollars in lost revenue and is predominantly harmful.\n\nHowever, if research has shown anything over the years, it’s that piracy can have positive effects too.\n\nIndeed, a new study from researchers at Monash University and San Jose State University, published in Research Policy, provides fresh evidence for this. It suggests that, under the right conditions, piracy can boost box office ticket sales.\n\nThe paper, titled “Avengers assemble! When digital piracy increases box office demand”, uses a dataset that matches U.S. box office revenue with the timing of high-quality piracy releases between 2004 and 2020.\n\nThe researchers find that the impact of piracy on movie theater attendance differs for various types of films.\n\nFor this study, the researchers make a distinction between “Spectacle” films, which include stunning visual blockbusters or action flicks, and “Story” films, such as dramas and comedies.\n\nSpectacle films are broadly defined as movies where the in-theater experience significantly adds to the experience. For example, through stunning visuals and immersive surround sound. Story films, however, rely more on the dialogue, screenwriting, and acting—qualities that can also be enjoyed on a laptop or TV.\n\nAfter categorizing the films, the researchers analyzed a dataset of U.S. box office figures, matching these with upload data from The Pirate Bay to track when high-quality pirated copies appeared online. Since the timing of these pirate releases is quasi-random, the research effectively infers a causal effect of piracy on box office revenues, depending on the movie type.\n\nThese narrowed-down results are striking. While piracy seemingly hurt dramas and comedies, it appears to act as a promotional tool for ‘spectacle’ films, driving audiences to the movie theater rather than keeping them at home.\n\nThis isn’t a small effect either. The study estimates that high-quality pirate releases increase weekly box-office revenue by approximately 24.4% for spectacle films. For story films, the effect flips, as pirate releases lead to a 26.6% decline in weekly box-office revenue.\n\n“Our research shows that digital piracy does not harm all movies equally,” says the paper’s co-author Wendy Bradley, who works as an assistant professor of management at San José State University. She notes that, for spectacle-oriented films, piracy can act as a nudge to go to the box office.\n\n“Watching a pirated copy may convince people that the real value of the film comes from the shared cinematic experience, not just the story, and encourage them to watch in theaters. In contrast, story-driven movies are more vulnerable because piracy is a better substitute for in-theater visits,” Bradley says.\n\nThis is corroborated by the paper’s lead author, Klaus Ackermann, who notes that some movies are simply better suited for today’s movie theater experience.\n\n“A romantic comedy or ‘chick flick’ like 27 Dresses offers a limited in-cinema experience by itself, while Marvel movies are a different story,” Ackermann notes, adding that movie theaters have already started to respond to this by offering more ‘experiences’ and special events.\n\nImportantly, the positive effects on box office revenues are unique to high-quality piracy leaks, which include “BluRay” or “HD” rips. The researchers found that low-quality versions, including CAM rips, consistently hurt box office revenues across all genres.\n\nThe impact is substantial here as well, as low-quality pirate releases were typically linked to a 24% drop in box office revenues.\n\nWhile these results may seem counterintuitive, the authors have statistically ruled out several alternative explanations. That said, the study relies on a quasi-random research design that tried to simulate causality. Therefore, follow-up research is needed to replicate and potentially expand these spectacular results.\n\nThe paper suggests that future research may also want to consider the effect of piracy on legal streaming subscription services like Netflix, or other forms of entertainment, such as video games.\n\nFor the movie industry, the paper once again suggests that a focus on adding value is key to competing with piracy. This is in line with research we covered last month, which showed that investments in the movie theater experience can help deter piracy.\n\nBradley stresses that their research indicates that piracy does not have to be met with more enforcement all the time. Instead, studios may want to focus on offering a better theater experience. Then, high quality pirate releases serve as promotion.\n\n“My takeaway for studios is that digital piracy isn’t going away,” Bradley says.\n\n“Rather than fighting it predominantly through legal means, whether that be lobbying for anti-piracy policy or expensive IP litigation, studios can strategically design, price, and release movies so that theatrical value becomes harder to replicate at home,” she concludes.\n\nAckermann, K., Bradley, W.

Grinning rez dogs with patchy coats rested in the sidewalk shade outside an alternative public high school called Buffalo Hide Academy, where lunch was ending. Students ambled into a warehouse-sized classroom with a podium and some tables at the far end, and musical instruments in a corner by the teacher’s office. Student artwork and a Blackfeet Nation flag bedecked the walls alongside a mural of a buffalo skull and the school’s name in dripping red letters. The kids didn’t sit in rows or take out homework; nobody checked whether they were on time. They shuffled around in grubby Converse, joking with each other at full volume. Some picked up instruments and started jamming with their teacher, Robert Hall (Piikunii), who was already messing around on the drum kit. It got loud, fast.</p>\n<p>“I would describe Browning as metal,” Hall told me, seated at the drums in a luau shirt and bushy black ponytail, his ferocious brown eyes the size of jawbreakers. “We don’t turn away from the darkness,” he said. “We don’t hide our own ugliness, the way that people in big cities could hide.” The town is rough, even by rez standards. “There’s buildings that have been standing just in a void. No humans, no life running through these buildings for years,” Hall explained. “But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”</p>\n<p>Another teacher, Charlie Speicher, warmed up the mic. “Who likes chaotic mathcore?” he tried, referring to a rhythmically unpredictable subgenre of hardcore punk that he describes as “bonkers” and “all over the place.” Two hands went up. One was mine. “That makes three of us,” said Speicher as he pulled up a YouTube video.</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338255) -->\n<p>The students were finishing the inaugural year of Buffalo Hide Academy’s semester-long, two-hour heavy music symposium dedicated to the study of metal and hardcore. Speicher, who’s non-Native, is a clinical counselor and also Buffalo Hide Academy’s director. The symposium was his brainchild. He and other teachers hand-picked students who looked like they might be isolated, or might be into darker, more aggressive art and music — kids who might be potential metalheads. More than fifty students initially enrolled. By the end of the first semester, kids were sneaking out of other classes to join.</p>\n<p>Speicher teaches in his “battle vest,” a staple of metal fashion that’s usually denim hand-studded with metal pyramids or spikes, and stitched with patches showing band logos in barbed, rootlike scripts impossible for the uninitiated to decipher. In addition to providing a feeling of physical protection, battle vests are threshold guardians that intimidate normies while signalling to dedicated fans who recognize the glyphs. If you know, you know — and you’re family. If not, fuck off. But Speicher is here to welcome kids into the fold, where a community of music fans understands their suffering. Or, as he put it later, “to create more safety and protection specifically from suicidal distress,” which he said has impacted every family in Browning.</p>\n<p>Some in Browning think he’s doing the devil’s work, but Speicher is as warm and approachable as a cool youth pastor, speaking gently and smiling easily through a handsome swath of stubble. His vest is emblazoned with the gaunt face from Converge’s 2001 album <em>Jane Doe.</em> He showed the kids the music video to “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY-JkeXK4dU\">Farewell, Mona Lisa</a>” by mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan. It sometimes sounds like Dick Van Dyke’s fancy footwork flawlessly executing a trip and stumble. “Goes hard, huh? What’d you see? What’d you hear?”</p>\n<p>It’s precise and complicated, students said. The guitars and drums are in conversation, mirroring each other. The drumming starts like black metal blast beats but switches into a groove. Rough vocals alternate with intelligible singing. Guitars are in standard tuning, not drop-tuning like most metal. The fashion is different from metal too – less theatrical. One student noted the singer’s contorted body language: “He’s feeling his emotions while he’s letting the art out of him.”</p>\n<p>“Mmm, beautiful,” Speicher said. Later, students looked at landscape photos and guessed which heavy genre or subgenre they represented: a frozen forest for black metal; a crumbling alley for doom; an urban protest for hardcore; an alligator swamp for death metal. They discussed “geographic determinism,” the theory that music is shaped partly by its place of origin.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But Speicher wasn’t just there to nerd out. He shifted seamlessly into an overview of heavy music’s therapeutic benefits: catharsis, community and coping skills. “Heavy music teaches us things such as we’re not alone; when life is dark, we do something about it. We’re not just a prisoner to that darkness. But also that our risk fluctuates, that our misery isn’t gonna last forever. There are ways through it.” Students doodled in notebooks, idly plucked at an unplugged bass guitar, or held hands under the table.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A history lesson from another teacher on the ’80s and ’90s Scandinavian origins of black metal — including its problematic elements, like murder and Nazism among some bands — served as a caution to consume media critically. While hardcore is overtly political and tends hard left, the morality of metal is murkier, oriented primarily around pushing extremes and attacking social norms. Results can be chaotic. This segued into a high-level, student-led conversation about whether and when to separate art from artist. In another lesson, Speicher said, they’d studied the Vietnam War through the lens of Black Sabbath, whose 1970 staple “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ssFjyDIyQ0\">War Pigs</a>” critiqued American involvement.</p>\n<p>“Your homework tonight, and I’ll remind you of this later, go listen to the song ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiKjcrniJKY\">43% Burnt</a>.’” Speicher told students to pay special attention to an influential breakdown at the end. They broke off to paint each other’s faces in “corpse paint,” and take album cover-style photos with animal skulls and hides. Emily Edwards (Piikunii), an almost-15-year-old, schooled me on Swedish rock. “You don’t know Ghost?” she said. Inspired by the class, Edwards and some friends had started their own band, Crimson Harmony. Edwards was one of many students who signed up for a paid internship at an upcoming metal festival called Fire in the Mountains coming to Blackfeet Nation later that summer. Festival internships were part of why teachers started the symposium.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nicholas Rink (Piikunii), who teaches Blackfeet studies and language, pulled me aside, brimming with excitement. He was painting the skull of a buffalo the students helped process. Across its brow he’d painted overlapping bear paws, mother and cub, in flame colors. He dotted them with pinprick white stars — Ursa Major and Minor, which he said both Piikunii and European traditions recognize as bears. The skull was a gift for Norwegian festival headliners Wardruna, whose latest album, <em>Birna</em>, was named in honor of the bear. Rink had aligned the painted stars to match the position the real stars would take when Wardruna performed beneath them in Blackfeet Nation.</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338259) -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\">\n<!-- RTT removed image (338258) -->\n<!-- RTT removed image (338257) --><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">(<em>Clockwise from top</em>) Students apply corpse paint at Buffalo Hide Academy in May.

Speicher said it hit the entire community “like a sledgehammer.” He called up a fourth grade teacher in Rathdrum, Idaho, named Steve Von Till, whom metalheads might recognize as a doomy poet-troubadour and the former Neurosis guitarist. Speicher, Hall, Rink, Von Till and a few others banded together to help their students stay alive, as if building a protective fire to shelter them in the darkness. They called themselves the <a href=\"http://firekeeperalliance.org/\">Firekeeper Alliance</a>.</p>\n<p>A few years earlier, the crunchy-pagan festival Fire in the Mountains was priced out of gentrifying Jackson, Wyoming. Speicher spoke to its owners about bringing the festival to the rez. He planned to build internships into his class to connect kids with career pathways in an industry of like-minded people. It sounded perfect. But first they needed buy-in from tribal council.</p>\n<p>The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council has long supported youth through athletics, especially running and basketball. Dipping into the arts, specifically music — to say nothing of metal — would be new territory. But Councilman Everett Armstrong told me that because it was for the kids, they considered it. “Let’s try to go a different route to give our youth something that they can open our minds to, open our hearts to, find themselves,” he said.</p>\n<p>It could help the nation economically, too, Armstrong said. The reservation lies along the imaginary line splitting Piikunii homelands into the colonial annex called Glacier National Park. The park is an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/news/tourism-to-glacier-national-park-contributes-548m-to-local-economy.htm\">over-half-billion-dollar industry</a>. But many Piikunii people, Armstrong said, live in poverty. It’s one of the factors contributing to the widespread suicidal distress that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html\">disproportionately harms Native communities</a>. When I told folks I was going to Blackfeet Nation, most didn’t know where that was, until I mentioned Glacier. The monied Glacier Park Lodge had a gift shop peddling Glacier mementos — but, despite being on the reservation, offered nothing I could take home that says “Blackfeet Nation.” “We need to try to tap into that and try to get some revenue back into the Blackfeet Reservation,” Armstrong said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the festival to work, they needed bands big enough to draw fans to the rez. So in August 2024, the Firekeepers flew to Boulder, Colorado, to court pagan folk band Wardruna, whose world tour was starting at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Speicher and the gang wanted to meet in person and convince them to play Blackfeet Nation. It’s for the children, they would say. Norwegian and Piikunii cultures share traditions of animism. The Firekeepers brought sweet pine ties, used for smudging, as gifts, and met Wardruna at the C.U. Boulder library. They didn’t know the band was already sold on the idea. Singer Einar Selvik had spoken to Speicher on the phone, and they were ready to say yes.</p>\n<p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert,” Selvik told me, “all the pieces just fit so well together.” It was a major get for the festival. Rink said they stayed up all night talking about it. Their vision and the Nordic stars had aligned.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<!-- RTT removed image (338261) -->\n<!-- RTT removed image (338262) --><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">&nbsp;Steve Von Till <em>(left</em>) and Wardruna lead singer Einar Selvik <em>(right</em>) during the festival.&nbsp;<strong>Russel Albert Daniels/High Country News</strong></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><strong>Dance Intertribal</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>LATE JULY: AMTRAK UNLOADED A GAGGLE OF BLACK DENIM</strong> and bandanna-clad metalheads onto the small, sunny platform at East Glacier Park, Montana, a tiny seasonal town 15 minutes outside Browning. Two days earlier, Ozzy Osbourne, the grandfather of metal and lead singer of Black Sabbath, had died.</p>\n<p>Because it was the festival’s first time on a reservation, nobody knew what to expect. Festivals, after all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/27/fyre-festival-2-mexico\">can go very badly</a>, and no one wanted to remember this as “Fyre” in the Mountains. But good omens greeted us. Our Lord and Savior Ozzy must have parted the week’s rainy spell for a few days of perfect festival weather: high 70s, partly cloudy, cool after sunset.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Firekeeper Alliance distributed tickets to the local community, and invited Blackfoot attendees from Canada. Others road tripped in, or flew into Kalispell, around 2,400 fans — a third of them Natives, Speicher and Rink estimated — converging from across the continent for three days and 23 bands.</p>\n<p>On the festival grounds, the party opened not with a land acknowledgement but a welcome from the land’s actual Indigenous people. In proper Native fashion, they held a grand entry, and true to form, it started late. “We’re runnin’ on Indian time!”&nbsp; shouted Hall through a megaphone, war-whooping and half-dangling from the back of a motorcycle that Speicher peeled across the rugged ground.</p>\n<p>As the crew finished setting up a stage in the distance, hundreds of metalheads sat watching in a circle while Piikunii locals in regalia danced fancy, traditional, chicken, jingle and grass. Young Grey Horse hammered the drum and Hall let his rowdy demeanor emcee, throwing out Charlie Hill jokes to keep the mood light. For many, it was a transformative moment. Some fans had never been to a powwow and were encountering Indigenous culture for the first time.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hall called for an intertribal — an all-inclusive dance. The metalheads hesitated, but after a few courageous outliers broke onto the grass, others followed, bouncing a circle in their battle vests and black jeans, like a respectful, slow-motion mosh pit, as they awkwardly tried to two-step like the pros. A showboating school-aged fancy dancer twirled past them in her shawl, rapid-fire footwork leaving them in the dust. But the dance was a welcome, not a competition. Hearts were opening. People cheered, Natives and non-Natives together.</p>\n<p>For Selvik, the powwow was a powerful way “to set the tone, to open the circle.” This festival required some vulnerability of attendees, some deference. We were guests on Piikunii lands. There would be no alcohol — a marked adjustment for metal culture. It would be, as Hall declared, “a cultural exchange between the Piikunii and metalheads.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><strong>Fringe Culture</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>“ON MY RESERVATION, PEOPLE ONLY LISTEN TO TWO THINGS:</strong> rap or hip-hop,” joked Logan Mason (Colville), who traveled from Spokane and volunteered with the camping crew in exchange for festival admission. Mason lost his brother and nephew to suicide, and metal helped him work through depression in his late teens and early 20s. “Growing up, I did not know anybody else that listened to black metal or death metal.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On other reservations, it’s different. The Navajo Nation, for example, has a genre-defining “<a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/photos-heavy-metal-music-in-the-navajo-nation-award/\">rez metal</a>” scene. Some folks joke that you’re either a hip-hop Native or a metal Native. If anything, Natives seem over-represented in the metal community. “A lot of it is land-based,” said Meg Skyum (Oji-Cree), who’d come to the festival from Ontario to see the Native black metal outfit Blackbraid and get a sneak preview of their third album. Atmospheric black metal in particular is “about the fucking trees and shit,” which Natives appreciate. Plus, Natives and metalheads, Skyum added, both live in the margins of ordinary society. “We’re fringe, they’re fringe.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“The metal tribe itself seems to attract a lot of people that go through different types of struggle,” said Tomas Falomir (Ojibwe, Hopi and Zuni Pueblo descent) from Parker, Colorado, noting that the music is healing, the community welcoming. “Any type of person could be included.”</p>\n<p>There’s also something about the sound, Falomir added. “It almost goes with the loudness, and even down to the beat of it.” Other fans agreed. The thundering drums and powerful vocals resemble a modernized version of Native music, one said. Pomona-based Indigenous death/doom project Tzompantli would later exemplify this, shaking the festival grounds with stomping downtempos from a battalion of traditional and contemporary drums. And European bands like Wardruna, fans noted, are really, <em>really</em> into their cultures, especially pre-Christian traditions, just like Natives.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma,” said Damien Jones Jr. (Diné), who traveled with family from Lukachukai in Navajo Nation, and brought one of the festival’s most-photographed battle vests, decked out with turquoise geometrics and a “Frybread Power” backpatch<em>.</em> Jones plays saxophone — classical and jazz. “That’s what I do as well, throw all my feelings and emotions into music.”</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338288) -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><strong>Dark Horse, Ride</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>“WELCOME TO THE BACKBONE OF THE WORLD,” </strong>read the sign at Red Eagle Campground, where the Rockies arched like the knobby vertebrae of a sleeping Elder God half-buried in sediment. Across glassy Two Medicine Lake an amphitheater of pines presided like a chorus between the water line and a low timberline. On the near bank, a footpath wound along the edge of the lake, opening to beach access here and there with pop-up canopies and scatterings of hay-bale seats for workshops and panels on Indigenous sovereignty, ethnobotany, the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous people, and the therapeutic effects of heavy music.</p>\n<p>A cluster of interconnected meadows transformed into parking lots, a village of glamping yurts, a small bazaar of vendor tents, and the “stage bowl”: a shallow glen with two stages set up between tipis serving as green rooms. Curtains of savory smoke stoked saliva as Montana “off-grid catering” team <a href=\"https://www.regionsauvage.com/\">Region Sauvage</a> barbecued ducks and student-processed buffalo. High school interns decorated the stages with skulls, antlers, driftwood, witchy-Indigenous pieces of the forest. Edwards worked the merch tent, hawking Firekeeper Alliance shirts that showed a malevolent spirit of suicide haunting a tipi where Native kids sheltered around a fire. Proceeds supported suicide prevention. Shirts sold out the first day. Parking attendants and security all seemed suspiciously chill. It was intentional, they explained. Natives are used to being followed and scrutinized. Nobody wanted that atmosphere here.</p>\n<p>First on stage was Sage Bond (Diné and Nde), an up-and-coming acoustic metal singer-songwriter from Tonalea in Navajo Nation, who’d previously toured in support of suicide prevention efforts on her reservation. Bond matched the mountain sunshine with a low snarl a la Eddie Vedder, before breaking into a roar the size of 10 mountain lions — what she called “the Cookie Monster vocals.” Bond expected a sparse crowd drifting in and out, but her performance captivated hundreds. It was a big moment — her first time playing a festival that size, which she jokingly called a “black metal Coachella” (though the only feather headdresses were on tribal council members). “How the heck did they even find me?”</p>\n<p>Turns out Bond was recommended by Chicago black metal artists Pan-Amerikan Native Front. During their set, they invited students onstage to headbang alongside the singer, Kurator of War, in black-and-white face paint and crossed bullet sashes. Other students held up a Blackfeet Nation flag&nbsp; and tossed their long hair next to barrel-chested guitarist Necroboar (Purépecha), who looked mean as hell in spiked leather cuffs, but later, backstage, was beaming. “A lot of people are thanking us for being here with the kids,” Necroboar said, “but it’s like you don’t understand what this means to us to be here and to see them.” He told me he and his bandmates saw themselves in the teenagers. Misty-eyed fans agreed, knowing they would remember this moment forever. The band had rehearsed their set that morning at Buffalo Hide Academy with the kids. They’d always wanted to play a rez. Being here was a dream come true. “I’m still shaking from it,” Necroboar said.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<!-- RTT removed image (338264) -->\n<!-- RTT removed image (338263) --><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">&nbsp;Sage Bond <em>(left</em>) and Liłith singer and guitarist Heather Jordan <em>(right</em>) perform during the festival. <strong>Russel Albert Daniels/High Country News</strong></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Musicians didn’t quarantine themselves. Many hung out with fans — riding horses, paddleboarding, doing yoga by the lake, attending workshops and panel discussions, or headbanging in the crowds. By the food stands selling frybread with huckleberry butter, metalheads set up a little table as an altar to Ozzy. It gathered river rocks, feathers, cigarettes, and trinkets. “Long Live the Prince of Darkness,” read a sign at the feet of a grinning Ozzy bobblehead and some candles.</p>\n<p>Twenty-four weeks pregnant, Heather Jordan (Diné) delivered a scorching set in the sunshine with her masked drummer pummeling the kit behind her. Jordan is the singer and guitarist for Navajo Nation blackened doomgaze duo Liłith. She’d wanted to play Fire in the Mountains because favorites like Wolves in the Throne Room preceded her. And it helped that this year’s festival focused on “the Native side of things.” Jordan works a day job at a restaurant serving tourists on her own rez, which is also dry. “It’s like the hardest thing for them to understand,” she said. When Fire in the Mountains invited Liłith, their answer was “Hell, yes.”</p>\n<p>The festival’s spirituality attracted Jon Krieger of Blackbraid, a solo recording project that blew up overnight when his first single, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buh0h-8zrP4\">Barefoot Ghost Dance on Blood Soaked Soil</a>,” got traction on YouTube in 2022. “All the black metal that’s the best in the world in my opinion comes from the heart,” Krieger said. Blackbraid was one of around five Native bands playing the festival, though Krieger, who was adopted, doesn’t know his tribal affiliation. Black metal is a spiritual genre, he said, and while it’s dominated by “Scandinavian dudes talking about old Norse religion and culture,” the values align. “Anti-Christianity is something that we share with them.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On stage later, beneath an array of a dozen stag skulls, Krieger was slinking around like a ghostly Indigenous Jim Morrison, windmilling his waist-length hair, blasting life force through a cedar flute and leaning over the crowd to shriek upward-arcing shards — whose strength never flagged during his entire blistering set — as his guitarist crowned his howls with constellations of tremolo picking. In the mosh pit, one fan hoisted a buffalo rib the size of a baseball bat, presumably from the barbecue, like some feral invocation. Blackbraid’s performance may have converted Daniels, the photographer, to solid metal fandom. But after Converge, he stood by me and said, “Now I get it.”</p>\n<p>Converge was another get, one of Speicher’s favorites. Bassist Nate Newton had Zoomed into Speicher’s classroom to chat music with students. So had Ivar Bjørnson from Enslaved — A-listers, donating their time to Browning rez kids.</p>\n<p>Before Converge played, Speicher and the other Firekeepers presented them with a buffalo skull painted with the iconic <em>Jane Doe</em> face. And they gifted the buffalo’s tongue, the most prized part of the animal, to tribal council.</p>\n<p>A mosh pit opened in the center of the crowd as soon as Converge blasted forth, the biggest and most fearsome pit yet. The chaos of bodies in conflict summoned a dust devil from the Earth into the sky. It might not look like it, but there’s a shared ethic at work, what Hall called “consensual fucking violence, man.” If you get a bloody nose, you can be proud. If you fall, fans pick you back up. We aren’t fighting. By bracing and colliding, we’re helping each other. The rush is purifying. The release, stabilizing. Jumping in, you might want to die, but when the pit spits you out, you’ll be beaming like Necroboar — happy to have survived the maelstrom.</p>\n<p>Partway through Converge’s set, skinny, sleeve-tatted frontman Jacob Bannon passed the mic to a Piikunii youth, who seamlessly took over the chorus of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV4x5DsES9w\">Dark Horse</a>.”</p>\n<p><em>We’ll show the demons<br />For what they are<br />Dark!<br />Horse!<br />Ride!<br />Towards the light!</em></p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338626) -->\n<p>He knew every shout and scream by heart, absolutely commanding the stage. The crowd was living for it.</p>\n<p>Musicians understood the assignment and turned it up to 11, new blood and seasoned pros alike. As dusk settled, staff closed the lakeside trails, mindful of everyone’s safety, while Finnish folk metal band Hexvessel sang about people disappearing into the forests. After dark, fans gathered around a bonfire to ward off the chill. Wardruna took the stage and spread their haunting ambience to the woods’ inky edges. Someone dressed like a wizard slipped through the crowds as a human figure with antlers danced silhouetted before a glowing tipi. High above a membrane of diffuse gray, the bear stars slowly turned.</p>\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>A Strange Road to Joy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A FULL MAP OF METAL'S SPRAWLING SUBGENRES</strong> is hard to pin down. But for what it’s worth, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Musical_subgenres_by_genre\">Wikipedia lists 34 subgenres and 16 sub-subgenres</a> of metal, rivalled primarily by much broader genres like pop, rock, and opera, the latter which has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_opera_genres\">120</a> subgenres. <em>Encyclopaedia Metallum</em> lists <a href=\"https://www.metal-archives.com/browse/genre\">16 main subgenres</a>, but sub-subgenres and combinations seem unlimited.</p>\n<p>Like opera, much of metal prioritizes the voice — though as an aesthetic inversion. Similar to Inuit throat singing, vocalizations are guttural and challenging to master. Like wine, metal adheres to a pedigree whose sense experience reflects a place of origin: Cascadian black metal, for instance, is hazy as the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest. And like European classical music, or jazz, metal ranges in style from ambient drone to bombastic spectacle to precise and unpredictable arrangements astonishing to perform.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“We’ve all&nbsp;had periods&nbsp;of hurt. And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But something deeper draws metalheads together, perhaps a willingness to inquire on levels the establishment forbids. What most clearly sets it apart from other genres is that it’s so rooted in anger and sadness — or their common ancestors: terror, lack, isolation and despair. Metal, one fan told me, is “a strange road to joy.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve all had periods of hurt,” Kurator of War said, seated on a folding chair next to Von Till with singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe, Newton and Bjørnson. No makeup, no bullets. Behind them, morning clouds rippled like flags on the glacier-crisp pebble beds of Two Medicine Lake. “And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.” A crowd of metalheads sat cross-legged on the grass, or perched on hay bales in the partial pine shade, listening to the panel. “I think we’re all curious. I think we’re all empathetic. I think we want to get to that other side of connection and knowledge.”</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338628) -->\n<p>Speicher lobbed questions that prompted an intimate conversation about the healing power of heavy music, which at times drew tears — from fans and musicians. Von Till said heavy music is a way of “getting rid of the sickness,” which helps him become more sensitive and vulnerable. He also noted the importance of catharsis. “How many times has that moment of release prevented that one moment in a kid that can’t be retaken?”</p>\n<p>Early in Bjørnson’s life, he realized people had to be athletic or good looking for acceptance in some groups. “With the metal gang, the qualification was being into metal,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It’s not like this kind of stuff attracts normal people. Like we all — you’re weird. You’re all weird,” Newton said to ripples of laughter and cheers. “And it’s beautiful. We could be completely different but we have this one thing that we both understand: why we’re into it.”</p>\n<p>“It’s them that are weird,” Von Till parried. “We’re the normal ones, right? Fuck that.” More cheers.</p>\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Oh, Lord, Yeah</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ON THE THIRD DAY, THE SKY RENT IN TWO.</strong> Just as the evening drained of color, the power went out — halfway through a set by Virginia headbangers Inter Arma. They didn’t stop.

Then the familiar tick of a tempo rose from the drummer’s high hat cymbals. The crowd started laughing, cheering, singing. It was “War Pigs” — Sabbath. Colorful stage lights fired back up. When the metalheads sang “Oh, Lord, yeah!” the sneer of Ozzy’s voice carried like mist across the many, a phantom formed by hundreds of mouths in unison. Re-amped guitars picked up the lick to complete the collective homage. Piikunii highschoolers sieged the stage again, drumming powwow style alongside the band.</p>\n<p>Nigh had the crowd caught its breath when lightning flashed like a Catholic schoolteacher flicking the lights. Thunder murmured from the belly of the Rockies beyond a ridgeline that blurred into rolling gray. Another flash. Closer, noted Daniels, the photographer; maybe two second’s delay. Sparse droplets swelled to a downpour. The lightless heavens opened, the Prince of Darkness summoned.</p>\n<p>“This is metal,” a festival staff member in a Day-Glo vest shouted to fans gathered under the merch tent. He wasn’t speaking metaphorically. The tent’s frame could draw lightning. “Shelter in your cars or tents!” he ordered. “Go, now! <em>Now!”</em> Metalheads scrambled for cover, evacuating in slick mud.</p>\n<p>Daniels and I found ourselves with some new friends, ducking into the yurt of one of the musicians, Rebecca Vernon, founder of Salt Lake City doom-sludge band SubRosa, who now performs a solo piano project called The Keening. She invited us in, offered us snacks, made sure we were all safe and hydrated. We laughed together, Natives and non-Natives, prisoners of the darkness, speculating about whether Inter Arma had summoned the spirit of Grandfather Ozzy and he was messing with us from — wherever he was. We worried the next set might be canceled. It was one of the headliners, Old Man’s Child, a fan favorite that helped define the Norwegian black metal sound in the early days. In over 30 years, Old Man’s Child had never played in the United States. But they’d agreed to play Blackfeet Nation.</p>\n<p>“Debuting in a setting like this adds depth to the moment,” singer Galder <a href=\"https://knotfest.com/blogs/from-the-artist/galder-discusses-old-man-s-child-s-homecoming-and-american-debut-at-fire-in-the-mountains\">told the website <em>Knotfest</em></a> before the festival. “There’s something about the rawness and unpredictability of the natural world that mirrors what I try to capture in Old Man’s Child. The beauty in the darkness, the stillness before the storm, the feeling of something ancient just beneath the surface.” That ancient unpredictability may have just gotten the better of his grand North American debut.</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338269) -->\n<p>A scream rang through the night. Or a shout? It was hard to understand, like metal vocals. I unzipped the door flap. The rain had stopped. The shouts rang clearer a second time: “Show’s back on!” We jammed our feet back into soggy shoes and boots.</p>\n<p>It was fully nighttime when the storm’s misery passed. A string of fans with phone flashlights and headlamps meandered back down the muddy path and over a little footbridge, across a babbling brook to the clearing where the bonfire flared bright and warm between the stages, belching embers upward like some inverted underworld rain. From a distance, the returning metalheads looked like a serpent of stars.</p>\n<p>By firelight we danced with a Piikunii grandmother in a silk bandanna to Dio’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrBUjXaRSUQ\">Rainbow in the Dark</a>,” euphoria setting in from the topsy-turvy snafu and the might of nature, which had banished all traces of late-festival fatigue. Then finally, riding in on the heels of the thunderstorm, Old Man’s Child took the stage. Galder, in corpse paint, dispatched legions of fog wraiths, strobe spectres galloping across a sea of electrified faces. A beautiful hell broke loose, exorcising our collective and personal demons. The festival — the ceremony — was complete.</p>\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>‘Our ancestors held ceremony together’</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ON SOCIAL MEDIA, FANS WERE STUPID WITH ENTHUSIASM </strong>about the weekend: <em>“Pure magic,”</em> <em>“transformational,”</em> <em>“profound,</em>”<em> “life changing.” </em>They posted reports of unexpected tears and healing. One Instagram comment called it the “the most incredible metal festival I’ve been to, and it was my 3rd one this summer.” Others called it the best music festival they’d been to of any genre. Daniels, newly baptized, joined the chorus: “<em>I have joined the cvlt.”</em></p>\n<p>And it wasn’t just the music. The consensus seemed to be that the lack of alcohol actually enhanced the experience. Frank Godla, co-founder of digital publication <em>Metal Injection</em>, said he learned <a href=\"https://metalinjection.net/show-recap/fire-in-the-mountains-2025-rewrote-the-script-of-what-a-heavy-metal-fest-could-should-be\">more about Native people at this festival</a> than he ever had from books or documentaries. Wardruna echoed the many in posting humble thanks to the Blackfeet Nation: “There are so many people out there in the world who deeply sympathize and stand with you and your ancestors in all your struggles. I am one of those people,” Salnik captioned a picture of himself on stage, proudly holding aloft the hand-painted buffalo skull. “It was like our ancestors held ceremony together and their meeting is rippling as we speak.”</p>\n<p>And the learning was two-way: Tribal Chairman Rodney “Minnow” Gervais took the stage to remark on how kind and diverse the metalheads were, how clean they kept the grounds. “Be proud of yourselves,” he said. “What you see here is proof that music transcends religion, color, whatever you want. It brings us all together.”</p>\n<p>“They look scary,” Councilman Armstrong told me about the metalheads, “but they’re some of the nicest people. They’re so welcoming.” People I spoke to in East Glacier agreed. Armstrong said tribal council is now considering branching into music events of other genres, too.</p>\n<p>“It’s heartwarming to have a full circle moment for me,” Mason, the fan from Spokane, said, seeing Native culture come together with the music he loves, in support of a cause close to his heart. “I was like damn, was this festival calling me?” After interning at the merch tent, Edwards said she might pick a different long-term job, but does see herself working in the music industry. And she wants to keep playing in a band when she is older, Crimson Harmony or otherwise.</p>\n<p>As stray metalheads sat around the grand foyer of Glacier Park Lodge, leaning on their backpacks or napping on the sofas, waiting for the evening train, a classical guitarist plucked out a polished-up version of the Led Zeppelin classic “Stairway to Heaven.” On the train back to the West Coast, the metalheads hung out as new friends. In the observation car, they shared weekend highlights, Natives and non-Natives together.</p>\n<p>A week later, I saw Von Till and Vernon again, this time in Portland, the last stop on Von Till’s summer tour before the new school year. We were still thinking about the festival. We tried to pin down what it was about Fire in the Mountains that still had us sobbing intermittently a week out. Von Till nailed it: “It made me dare to hope.”</p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338267) -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Can You Imagine</strong></p>\n<p><em>“If there’s a world where we don’t have to worry about suicide, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about bullying, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about violence, about war.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I feel like that world wouldn’t work.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“You could try to picture it, but it never really fully comes into view.”</em></p>\n<!-- RTT removed image (338268) -->\n<p><em>“I feel like it needs to be talked about.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I like to daydream about that a lot.”&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>“These are things I think about too much and I don’t have too many spaces to set them out of my mind.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“There’d probably be a lot more people at the reservations, and more family and connection.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Those little subtle moments that we all share, of sitting next to the fireplace, or sharing a new book, making a new friend, all of that would still keep expanding in mysterious ways of goodness.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Everyone just being creative.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“It looks probably a little bit like heaven.”</em> &nbsp;</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n<p>If you’re considering suicide, please call or text <strong>988</strong>, or chat online at <strong><a href=\"http://www.988lifeline.org\">988lifeline.org</a></strong>, for a free, confidential conversation with a trained crisis counselor.

    "fullText": "However, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nHowever, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nApple has lost its appeal of a massive district court ruling in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic Games.\n\nThat April ruling from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple “willingly” failed to comply with a 2021 order allowing mobile app developers to link to payment options outside of Apple’s, and she barred Apple from charging a commission on in-app purchases using external payment links, among other restrictions. In today’s opinion, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.\n\nGonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”\n\nBut the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting any fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.\n\nThe panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”\n\nThe opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”\n\nApple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from Bloomberg and Schaeffer’s Investment Research about the ruling.",

Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.\n\nMany car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.\n\n“Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.\n\nThat trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.\n\nChinese automakers take a bigger bite\n\nWhile luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.\n\n“Their (Chinese carmakers’) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,” Yuan said. “That’s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.”\n\nThe Chinese brands’ share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.\n\nBYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for “new energy vehicles,” which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.",

    "fullText": "Summiting Mount Everest is not just a major feat of human endurance; it also requires immense preparation, knowledge, and environmental awareness.\n\nProspective climbers need to meet prerequisites, undertake a brutal training regimen, and spend a significant amount of money to even attempt it.\n\nHowever, you'd never guess that looking at a short video shared on Reddit's r/InterestingAsF***. ()\n\nMount Everest covered in waste, including lots of human excrement \n byu/batninam3000 ininterestingasfuck\n\nIt wasn't clear precisely where on Everest the footage was taken, but the conditions depicted were unacceptable in any natural setting.\n\n\"Mount Everest covered in waste, including lots of human excrement,\" the post's title read. While the breathless narrator's commentary was difficult to hear over the wind, the words \"dirty camp\" were clearly audible.\n\nAbandoned tents, discarded climbing gear, and mountains of waste rivaling Everest itself were visible in every direction.\n\nAs National Geographic noted, Everest was first summited in 1953, and in the intervening decades, it has become the \"world's highest garbage dump.\" The outlet added that the broader site, Sagarmatha National Park, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.\n\nUNESCO's Cleaning Everest page, published in 2013, explained that commercially organized expeditions began in the 1980s, and with them, a waste management problem developed.\n\nClimbing Mount Everest is notoriously deadly, with mortality rates ranging between 1% and 6% of all climbers. Historically, these ecological impacts have been attributed in part to a focus on survival — but that doesn't mean the issue isn't grave.\n\nDo you think America has a plastic waste problem?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Pollution in the Himalayas endangers access to and consumption of water, as the glaciers feed Asia's biggest rivers, used by over 2 billion people,\" UNESCO stated.\n\nDebris, deforestation, and unnatural stress on footpaths and natural resources have taken a huge toll on the region, with as many as 1,000 people attempting the climb each year.\n\nAccording to National Geographic, each climber produces around 18 pounds of waste, \"and the majority of this waste gets left on the mountain,\" leaving the mess to locals.\n\nSeasoned trekkers emphasize the importance of sustainable expeditions to those considering the journey, but the problem persists, and Reddit users were horrified by the short clip.\n\n\"Genuinely don't get the concept of people littering in nature. If you had the room to bring it, you have the room to take it away,\" one observed.\n\n\"Extremely wealthy people are toxic to society. … These people have never taken out the trash in a day in their lives,\" another remarked, referring to the prohibitive cost of summiting Everest.\n\n\"Humans are a plague.

    "fullText": "A man is in critical condition after police say an off-duty officer shot him following a road rage confrontation in Orange County.\n\nIt happened Thursday around 3:45 p.m. on Dolsontown Road near McVeigh Road.\n\nCellphone video appears to show what went down after one man pulled a knife and the officer pulled a gun.\n\nOfficials say the confrontation escalated when the driver of a Volkswagen, 31-year-old Wallace Fisher, got out of his car and approached the driver of a Toyota.\n\nPolice say the verbal altercation at the driver's side window turned physical and Fisher allegedly pulled out a knife and took a swing inside the car.\n\nIt is unclear in the video if he is holding the knife as he takes a swing.\n\n\"The boy swing, he punched him and immediately three shots went off,\" Eyewitness Rob Parker said.\n\nThat is when the driver of the Toyota, 33-year-old Anthony Simon, an off-duty Kingston police officer, discharged his firearm and shot Fisher, authorities say.\n\nThe eyewitness who shot the video of the incident said he started rolling when he noticed the two cars swerving and cutting each other off -- a spat that began when one cut the other off while exiting a car wash.\n\n\"The person that got cut off from the cop was tailgating after that, the cop was brake-checking him then the boy tried to pass him and the cop went on the other side of the road and tried to run him off the road,\" Parker said.\n\nFisher was shot twice in the neck and shoulder and was taken to the hospital, where he was said to be critical but stable at Westchester Medical Center.\n\nSo far, no charges have been filed as state police continue to investigate.\n\nPolice are reviewing video and interviewing witnesses.\n\n\"When he got out the car, he could have left. The same way I watched him swerve lane to lane and he get out the way or him the boy from passing. I feel like the whole thing could have been avoided. On both parties, I feel like they were wrong,\" Parker said.\n\nThe Kingston Police Department said the officer, who has been employed by the Kingston Police since 2022, has been placed on administrative duty until the investigation is concluded.\n\n----------\n* More Northern Suburbs news\n* Send us a news tip\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts \n* \nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

    "description": "XRP price prediction turns critical as momentum improves and large holders step in. One level now decides if the reversal narrative holds.",
    "fullText": "XRP price has rebounded from recent lows, rising nearly 4% from yesterday’s bottom and stabilizing after a modest pullback. While the broader trend remains cautious, a new metric suggests downside momentum may be fading.\n\nWith the XRP issuer recently moving closer to regulated-banking status, the focus now shifts to whether large holders continue to step in to confirm a real trend change.\n\nOn the daily chart, the XRP price has flashed a bullish divergence between December 1 and December 12. During this period, price made a lower low, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formed a higher low. RSI measures momentum, and this pattern often appears when selling pressure weakens before a rebound.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nThis setup has already triggered a bounce, but what makes it more compelling is whale behavior. The two largest XRP holder groups have already started responding.\n\nWallets holding more than 1 billion XRP increased their holdings from 25.36 billion on December 9 to 25.42 billion. At the same time, wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP reversed their selling trend, rising from 8.08 billion on December 11 to 8.15 billion at press time.\n\nIn total, these two cohorts added roughly 130 million XRP. At the current price, that equals about $265 million in net accumulation. This confirms that the biggest holders are not just watching the divergence, they are acting on it.\n\nThe timing also matters. Ripple recently moved closer to securing a US banking license, reinforcing its long-term institutional narrative. That regulatory backdrop gives added weight to whale interest at these levels.\n\nFor the bullish divergence to stay valid, the XRP price needs follow-through. The first level that matters is $2.11. A daily close above it would mark a 3.72% move from current levels and confirm that buyers are regaining short-term control. XRP has not held above $2.11 since early December.\n\nIf that level breaks, the next resistance sits at $2.21. Only a sustained move above $2.21 would shift the structure bullish and reopen the path toward $2.58 or higher.\n\nOn the downside, risk remains clearly defined. If the XRP price falls below $1.96 while RSI weakens, the bullish divergence would be invalidated. That scenario would expose $1.88 first, followed by $1.81 if selling accelerates.\n\nRight now, the setup is constructive but unfinished. Momentum indicators show improvement, and whales have already responded once. For this reversal to fully play out, those large holders need to keep adding support, not just react briefly.\n\nRead original story Largest XRP Whales Are Making a Move – Will Price Respond? by Ananda Banerjee at beincrypto.com",

    "description": "\"That ignorant mentality might have someone throw a rock at the truck next time if we don’t stick out and tell these freaks to stop.\"",
    "fullText": "A Cybertruck owner in Worcester, Massachusetts, tried to trade in his golden Tesla Cybertruck after he and his family faced constant harassment, but the company refused, Torque News reported.\n\nKumait Jaroje shared on the Tesla Cybertruck Enthusiast Facebook group that he and his family have been regularly harassed for driving it. People would make offensive hand gestures or yell at them — someone even vandalized his truck by putting a Nazi sticker on it. The Nazis, along with their collaborators, murdered six million Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nJaroje said that the harassment was starting to affect his family. His children have become frightened by the hostilities, and his wife now refuses to drive the truck at all. \"My wife and kids don't deserve this,\" he wrote in his Facebook post.\n\nOut of concern for his family, Jaroje tried to trade in his Cybertruck at Tesla, but the company wouldn't accept it.\n\nInstances of harassment like this can hinder the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, which are crucial in reducing people's reliance on dirty energy sources like oil and gas.\n\nThe EPA noted that burning gas and diesel releases heat-trapping gases. EVs can help cut that pollution because they don't produce tailpipe exhaust. Some drivers still hesitate to switch to EVs because of myths about range anxiety, according to U.S. News and World Report, and concerns about the pollution created by battery production.\n\nEven with the mining needed for EV batteries, a researcher from the University of Oxford revealed that the world extracts far more coal, oil, and gas — about 16.5 billion tons per year, compared with roughly 7.7 million tons of minerals mined for low-carbon technology.\n\nHarassment and stigma add barriers for people trying to make cleaner transportation choices. Greater public understanding of the benefits of EVs and how they reduce reliance on dirty energy can help decrease the stigma for early adopters.\n\nCommenters on Jaroje's post sympathized with him. A few fellow Cybertruck owners suggested ignoring the hostilities, but Jaroje said that doing so might make things worse.\n\n\"It is not a 'be cool' sticker. It is someone accusing me of being a Nazi and telling me to buzz off. The truck got scratched many times, and I fixed it without a problem.

    "description": "The animal \"swooped out of nowhere.\"",
    "fullText": "A forest hike turned unexpectedly dramatic for TikTok user Taylor Chine (@taylorchine), who recently shared a short clip from a trail in the area of Mount Assiniboine and Banff National Park in Canada. The video shows one hiker — along with the cameraperson — attempting to navigate around a territorial grouse blocking the path.\n\nWhat seems to have begun as a normal trek quickly escalated when the bird \"swooped out of nowhere,\" flapped its wings, and chased the hikers off the narrow forest trail, a moment captured in the footage.\n\nThe caption joked that the hikers were \"fully prepared for a grizzly attack, but not this,\" with feeble attempts at politely asking the bird, addressed as \"sir,\" to please allow them to pass.\n\nChine's TikTok shows the hikers cautiously trying to usher the grouse away from the trail while keeping a respectful distance. Instead, the bird makes the first move, lunging toward them with a flurry of wings.\n\nFor hikers in the Canadian Rockies, this kind of encounter isn't unheard of; grouse can become aggressive or defensive when nesting or when startled by sudden movement. In this case, the bird's swift, bold approach forced the hikers to retreat as it held its ground on the path.\n\nWhile the moment is lighthearted in tone, it also underscores how wildlife behavior can catch off-guard even the most prepared hikers — often those expecting larger or more widely discussed animals that pose a greater threat.\n\nUnusual or heightened wildlife interactions such as this might be partially linked to broader environmental pressures. As human populations grow and outdoor recreation expands deeper into wild spaces, animals are increasingly bumped into closer, and sometimes, tense contact with people.\n\nHabitat loss and shifting food availability driven by rising global temperatures can further intensify these overlaps, pushing wildlife to behave more defensively or wander into areas with high human traffic.\n\nProtecting healthy ecosystems doesn't just benefit animals; it helps keep human-wildlife encounters more predictable and less confrontational. When habitats remain intact and species have adequate resources, animals are more likely to stay dispersed and less likely to guard limited territory aggressively.\n\nNational parks across Canada continue to promote responsible hiking practices, including staying on marked trails, giving wildlife plenty of space, and avoiding sudden movements that can startle animals.\n\nVisitors can help by planning routes carefully, learning the behaviors of local species, and supporting conservation efforts that protect large, connected habitats.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nDespite the colossal influence of cryptocurrencies on commerce, computing, and even politics, the true identity of the presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains a mystery in 2025. Making things trickier for identity sleuths, this individual (or perhaps the name represents a group?) disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010, that’s exactly 15 years ago.\n\nThough the last public message from the BTC founder was about technical matters, an email that appears to be from Nakamoto's account was sent to a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast, Mike Hearn, in April 2011. It began with an explanation for absence, of sorts, with the first line reading \"I've moved onto other things.\"\n\nBenjamin Wallace, the author of The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto: A Fifteen-year Quest to Unmask the Secret Genius behind Crypto, wrote earlier this year that the BTC creator’s defining moment was the publication of an article on November 1, 2008.\n\nOn that day, the nine-page-long Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was shared on a little-known crypto mailing list. Its significance: it would solve the double-spending problem, which had cryptographers in knots for decades prior.\n\nIn essence, Nakamoto proposed a public ledger using blockchain that would prevent fraudulent copying and thus double-spending of any digital asset. This peer-to-peer system would be developed and refined by the BTC creator over the following months before their disappearance.\n\nWherever they are or however they live today, the most famous name in crypto history may also be one of the wealthiest entities in the world. Recently cited as the 11th-richest ‘person,’ Nakamoto is thought to still hold the majority of the 1.1 million BTC they mined in the currency’s first year.\n\nToday, that crypto fortune would be worth about $99 billion. However, BTC valuations have recently slid to around $90,000 after several months of oscillation around the $110,000 to $120,000 level.\n\nNakamoto’s BTC fortune has remained unspent since 2010, while its valuation has fluctuated wildly. This incredible level of HODLing has led analysts to believe the BTC creator has either passed away or has tragically lost access to the crypto. Others still believe Nakamoto is intentionally maintaining an absolute silence.\n\nBitcoin has no expiration mechanism, with no timeouts, no inactivity penalties, or other kind of reversion to the network. Moreover, there seems to be no quantum or other new-fangled computer cryptography tech that is anywhere near breaking the SHA-256 algorithm. Thus, these coins may indeed remain inaccessible to anyone other than Nakamoto for the next 20–40 years.\n\nHowever, the situation could change if any of the founders’ coins are ever moved or spent. Such an action would cause a stir in itself. Still, it would also expose the public key of that specific coin, creating a more vulnerable attack surface for a sufficiently powerful future quantum computer.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "Rep. Suhas Subramanyam confirmed that sex acts are depicted, while Rep. Robert Garcia stated that \"some are very disturbing [images] of women and their conditions\"",
    "fullText": "There are photos of \"people engaged in sexual acts\" among the images the House Oversight Committee collected from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, per Rep. Suhas Subramanyam\n\nRep. Robert Garcia echoed that \"some are very disturbing [images] of women and their conditions\"\n\nHouse Democrats released two batches of photos on Dec. 12, with Garcia promising more will come to light\n\nAs House Democrats continue to release photos collected from late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate, a congressman has confirmed that some of the images depict people engaged in sexual acts.\n\nAfter the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee shared a selection of photos from Epstein's estate — more than 95,000 photos have reportedly been collected, in total — on Friday, Dec. 12, Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam confirmed on CNN’s The Arena with Kasie Hunt that some of the unreleased images depict “a lot of people” engaging in sexual acts.\n\nAsked if the committee has pictures of “people engaged in sexual acts” among the collected images, the Democratic congressman told Hunt that “as part of this release, yes, there are pictures of people engaged in sexual acts.”\n\nThe CNN political correspondent also inquired about whether men other than Epstein are shown engaging in these acts, to which Subramanyam answered: “We’re going through that.” The congressman said that lawmakers are “not really quite sure yet who is who,” but added, “Certainly, there are a lot of people involved, though, in some of these acts.”\n\nThe first batch of 19 images show more than 10 prominent men — including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Steve Bannon and the former Prince Andrew — in a variety of settings through the years. The same day as the initial release, House Democrats released 70 more images, which depict different angles of previously released photos from Epstein’s private island, per CNN.\n\nNone of the photographs released so far depict any sexual misconduct or individuals believed to be minors, according to CNN.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHunt also asked Subramanyam about what “disturbing\" — which has been widely used to discuss the Epstein photos, both released and unreleased — means in this context. \"I mean, we’re talking about sexual acts involving, potentially, minors and certainly victims, too, in very suggestive, compromising positions,” the Virginia Democrat said. “Just to leave it at that.”\n\nThe congressman also offered comments on some of the figures depicted in the newly released images. Asked if the Clinton family was given a warning ahead of the release, Subramanyam said: “We are not looking to shield anyone, Democrat or Republican. We are finding the evidence, and we’re putting it out.”\n\n“The only people we’re really consulting with, when it comes to whether or not it’s appropriate to put something out, is victims,” Subramanyam added. (The House Oversight Committee covered the faces of several women in the newly shared photos for privacy reasons.)\n\n“If the Clintons have information, we want to hear it. We welcome them to come testify before a committee, clear their names,” he said, adding that the same is true for Gates, the former Prince Andrew and any others pictured in the photographs.\n\nAdded Subramanyam: “We want to hear from them all about what they know when it came to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.”\n\nCalifornia Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, also addressed the reportedly “disturbing” photos collected from Epstein's estate in a Friday interview.\n\nAppearing on CNN’s The Source with Kaitlan Collins on Dec. 12, Garcia told the host and White House correspondent that some of the images they received from Jeffrey Epstein's estate are \"quite disturbing.\"\n\nHe also told Collins that there are “many, many photos of women” among them. Specifically, he said, \"some are very disturbing of women and their conditions,” per Garcia, who added that lawmakers hope to release the photos in the “days and weeks” to come.\n\nHouse Democrats have vowed to release additional photographs as they continue to pore through the thousands of files they received.",

It’s thought that the fisher was extirpated, or rendered extinct, in Ohio by the mid-1800s. Causes for their extirpation were “unregulated harvest and loss of habitat,” according to the post.\n\nJosh Allen, Hailee Steinfeld announce pregnancy\n\n“This is tremendously exciting, as this is yet another extirpated native Ohio mammal species to be documented for the first time in Cleveland Metroparks. The return of fishers and other extirpated species like otters, bobcats and trumpeter swans are a result of conservation efforts and emphasize the importance of our healthy forests, wetlands, waterways and natural areas in Cleveland Metroparks,” the post said.\n\nFishers are typically found in forested areas with large tree canopies, and use tree cavities as dens, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. The mammals prey on squirrels, mice and birds.",

    "description": "I went Christmas tree shopping with my teens and was stunned by a $370 price tag. It sent me back to my childhood and our tiny cheap recycled tree.",
    "fullText": "It's traditional for our family to go Christmas tree shopping together, even though my kids are now 15 and 17 and practically leading their own lives.\n\nThis year was no exception. We found a brief window between my daughter's clock-in time for her part-time job at a gift store and my son's dentist appointment.\n\nIn previous years, we had invariably bought a tree from a Vermonter who set up camp in the parking lot of our local church.\n\nWhen we lived in New York City before our children arrived, my husband and I would buy one from a friendly sidewalk vendor with a truck full of fir trees.\n\nThere was something magical about picking it out, throwing it over your shoulder, and bringing it up to your apartment, despite the pine needles that dropped in the elevator.\n\nStill, as an immigrant from the UK, where people literally drag them home or transport them in the back of their vehicle, I still get a kick from seeing cars on the road with a tree strapped to the roof.\n\nThe guy from Vermont had failed to make the journey to our suburb for some reason this year. We chose to visit a nursery based on a friend's recommendation.\n\nIt was packed, but there were scores of trees remaining tethered to poles.\n\nSince it's my daughter's last Christmas before she heads off to college, we decided to make it extra special by getting a taller tree than usual.\n\nShe got first dibs on choosing, and after browsing the 9-foot and 10-foot sections, settled on the third one she saw.\n\nI strolled off to look at some garlands, only to see my husband frantically waving his arms at me. \"Get back in the car,\" he mouthed, not wanting anyone to hear.\n\nIt turned out the tree that our daughter selected cost $370 — the equivalent of $37 a foot. I gasped in shock. I knew we lived in one of the most expensive counties in New York — if not the US — but the price was off the charts.\n\nThere was no way I was going to pay close to $400 for something that would grace our living room for less than a month. Even the kids acknowledged that it wasn't worth the cash.\n\nThe experience prompted me to reflect on my childhood in northeast England during the 1970s. A distant memory stirred in my mind.\n\nI recalled how, several Decembers in a row, my dad dug up a 4-foot fir— for some reason nicknamed George — which was growing in our front garden.\n\nGeorge was so small and sparse, he could have belonged to Charlie Brown. But he'd replant him in a pot, and my sister, Alison, and I would decorate him with lights, tinsel, and ornaments.\n\nThen, at the beginning of January, Dad would put him back in the ground until the end of that year. I suppose we were a green family, long before it became a thing.\n\nGeorge was unearthed one year too many and then died. It was a sad day. We had always been thrilled to watch George enter and exit the house every Christmas.\n\nAfter the sticker shock over the $370 tree, I considered telling my kids that we would plant another George. But we ended up buying another 10-footer for just over $200 from a roadside stand.\n\nI mentioned our search for a more affordable tree to Ali. We reminisced about George. Two days later, she sent me a black-and-white photo from 1976 over WhatsApp.\n\nShe'd found a picture of 8-year-old me standing in our yard next to George. My mom had kept it at the bottom of a drawer all these years.",

    "description": "I never thought I'd plan my dad's funeral so soon. His death showed me why preparing for the inevitable brings comfort, not fear.",
    "fullText": "Sitting across from the funeral director, I held my husband's hand. I needed to feel something real while my body moved between sadness and shock. I glanced at my mom to steady her and at my husband for support. There was one person noticeably missing from our group: my dad.\n\nThe day before, I wouldn't have guessed I'd be spending my afternoon at a funeral home. I had talked to my dad that night and made plans for our weekly dinner. When I hung up the phone, I had no clue that was the last time I'd speak to him. There was no inner hunch that doom was on the horizon, and nothing that said he wasn't feeling well. So, the next morning, when the ER doctor told my mom, husband, and me that they tried to revive him and failed — I didn't know how to process the information. Dying of a heart attack made no sense. I thought we had plenty of time.\n\nThroughout my life, we had relied on him to answer the hard questions, and we desperately needed him now. It had only been three hours since his unexpected passing, and here we were planning his funeral. I had no idea what he wanted.\n\nI recall sitting at my parents' dinner table with my then-9-year-old son. He drank his milk while my dad gestured to the desk behind him. The white stack of papers (the size of a small novel) stood out against the stack of magazines. \"Do you want to read my will?\" my dad asked with a wink.\n\nNot really what I'd call an uplifting dinnertime read. At 71 years young, he was active and in good shape — a recent retiree ready to travel and spend time with his grandkids. I didn't want to think about his potential decline — my dad was invincible.\n\nHe never caught the colds and stomach flus I brought home from school. He rarely missed work, and I figured I wouldn't have to deal with this anytime soon. My grandparents lived well into their 80s — my great-grandmother until 100. I did the quick math — that was at least another 10 years or more.\n\nI politely declined the read, telling him there'd be plenty of time to cover that another day. \"That's all right,\" he began with a smirk,\" I fell asleep when I tried to proofread it.\" And that was that. There was no talk of caskets or whether he preferred The Beatles or the Rolling Stones to be played at his funeral.\n\nNo reason to discuss his death when he was so full of life. That night, we finished our hamburgers, and his will stayed on the desk, gathering dust, for the next year. And then time ran out.\n\nThis memory ran through my mind as I tried to answer the questions the funeral director asked. It was hard to concentrate with this huge lump in my stomach. Mostly, I wanted to cry and run away. Even hiding under the covers right now sounded like a good option.\n\nI concentrated on the warmth of my husband's hand and answered some basic questions, such as where my dad was born and his age. I failed when asked for his Social Security number. My mom tried to take over, but she was so distressed that her answers were slow and hard to access. I wanted to talk to my dad. I wish I had. This would be so much easier.\n\nLooking at my husband, I immediately thought about my son sitting in a similar seat for us. My shoulders tensed. My tears started again, but this time because I imagined an older version of my kid stumbling through unknown answers with no space to feel his feelings. I did not want this overwhelming ordeal for him. If I could make it easier or eliminate this step completely, I would.\n\nLater that night, when my husband and I had a quiet moment alone, I told him I wanted to write out our death details for our son. He looked surprised and whispered, \"We have plenty of time.\" I'm sure that was meant to reassure me, but it was exactly what I said to my dad not that long ago. My mom heart would do anything to protect our son's space to grieve. I wanted cozy childhood memories to comfort him when one of us couldn't — not images of his mom or dad in a casket.\n\nA few weeks later, as I processed my dad's passing, my husband and I talked about our own. We created a checklist of what we wanted, including which funeral home and cemetery to contact. My husband and I added doodles and love notes to the list and made sure our will was in order, too. Instead of freaking my 9-year-old with more morbid information, we told trusted family members where to find all the papers. Fingers crossed, it will sit in my desk drawer gathering dust for many more years to come.",

    "fullText": "If Elon Musk and Sam Altman like each other, they hide it well.\n\nIn the latest turn in the rivalry, the two are battling over the top spot on the list of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nWhile the two cofounded OpenAI together back in 2015, the partnership has frayed spectacularly since.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018 and later founded rival startup, xAI. Musk or his company, xAI, has filed lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI held a secondary share sale in October that valued it at $500 billion, taking the lead from Musk's SpaceX by a cool $100 billion.\n\nNot one to cede ground to a rival, Musk is now planning his own secondary share sale at SpaceX, according to an internal letter to employees seen by multiple outlets. It would value the company at a whopping $800 billion. If that happens soon, it means Musk would have only let Altman hold the mantle for a couple of months.\n\nMusk also confirmed on X this week that the company is exploring a blockbuster initial public offering, which might be the only way OpenAI can regain its lead as a private company. OpenAI this year restructured its business, which would allow it to also pursue its own eye-watering IPO in the future.\n\nWhile this valuation battle between the two billionaires is maybe cringeworthy theater for the average earner, it underscores a significant shift: investors are pouring unprecedented money into technologies once viewed as speculative science projects.\n\nSpaceX, which aims to make life multi-planetary and colonize Mars, and OpenAI, which seeks to develop a theoretical AI that can reason like humans, are two of the most visible examples, but they are part of a broader surge in frontier-tech valuations. AI, robotics, and defense tech startups have all notched multibillion-dollar valuations in the past year — bubble be damned.",

    "fullText": "The talent wars continue to rage across Silicon Valley as companies vie for the best and brightest minds in AI. There is, however, one major AI company that says it is not giving in to pressure.\n\nMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said on Bloomberg Podcasts that he doesn't plan to compete with tech giants like Meta by offering top dollar for talent.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's matching those things,\" Suleyman said of the $100 million signing bonuses Meta has been offering engineers, and the $250 million packages it's been using to lure top AI researchers.\n\n\"I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team, and I don't really think that's the right approach,\" he said.\n\nSuleyman said he was \"very selective\" about new hires when he previously worked at DeepMind. At Microsoft, he said he has hired \"incrementally,\" prioritizing candidates who aligned with the team's culture and had the right skills, and let go of those who did not.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the top ranks of AI talent are commanding pay packages in the millions.\n\nIn June, Meta spent $14.3 billion on an investment in Scale AI — a deal widely seen as an acquihire of its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Google also made a similar move, acquiring the leaders of Windsurf, an AI coding platform. in a deal worth $2.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that Meta tried to lure his employees away with $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said OpenAI later offered to match.\n\nEven at smaller startups, someone in an AI leadership role can command between $300,000 and $400,000 in base pay, Shawn Thorne, managing director at executive search firm True Search, previously told Business Insider.\n\nSuleyman said \"rotation\" is part of the industry, given the small pool of talent. He cited Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI, Amar Subramanya, decamping to Apple earlier this month as an example.\n\nMicrosoft recently brought in several new hires from DeepMind and OpenAI, he said.\n\n\"There's certainly no 'no poach' agreements, that would not be legal,\" he added. \"People can go work for whoever they want to work for.\"",

    "description": "A one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work for parenting. Over 20 years, I've learned my kids all respond to different styles.",
    "fullText": "For years, the soundtrack of my household has included some version of: \"But why doesn't she have to do that?\" or \"You never punish him!\" Every time I heard it, I'd get that familiar pang of mother guilt.\n\nHad I gotten lazy? Did I care less about what one did over the other? Was I a terrible parent for being too strict with one and not strict enough with another? Did I, in fact, have a favorite child?\n\nNow, nearly 21 years and three kids into motherhood, I finally understand that while yes, I was slightly less anxious as each kid joined our family, it wasn't so much that my parenting style was changing. It was that each of my kids needed to be parented differently, and I had been doing it all along without even realizing it.\n\nMy oldest made this realization the easiest. He genuinely values my advice and still calls me from college to ask for my thoughts on something before he makes a decision. He shares his fears, anxieties, and illness symptoms with me on the regular. But once we talk it through, he almost always goes off and figures things out for himself. With him, parenting is often about stepping back. He wants a sounding board, not a manager, and knowing he'll take the baton and run reassures me that with him, my job is to guide, not direct.\n\nMy middle child is the opposite. Being her parent activates a very specific reflex in me — the instinct to swoop in and take care of it all. She's the kid I want to protect from anything uncomfortable, the one I have to force myself to let wobble so she can learn to balance. She is smart, capable, and resourceful, but she processes her uncertainty through emotion and anxiety, and when I sense her panic, my impulse is to jump in and fix it. The hardest thing I've had to learn is that helping my daughter means not doing things for her but offering solutions while giving her the tools to manage them for herself.\n\nAnd then there's my youngest, who behaves as if he's been fiercely independent since birth. He likes to wave off my involvement and gets irritated if I so much as offer to set an alarm to wake him for school, ask if he's done his homework, or attempt to do his laundry for him. He doesn't want to be micromanaged, but likes to know that I am always close by, waiting quietly in the wings for those moments when it's all just too much, and he wants me to step in. With him, there's less heavy lifting and more just being there to catch him when he's falling.\n\nFor so long, I assumed parenting was something that should feel uniform, a philosophy you carry from one child to the next, maybe tweaking for age but not for temperament. All the while, I was unintentionally adjusting my parenting for each kid, while beating myself up for treating them differently. At some point, I internalized (or let my kids convince me) that \"fair\" meant \"the same.\" But the older my kids get, the clearer it becomes that what one kid experiences as support, another might experience as pressure. What one sees as freedom, another might interpret as abandonment.\n\nAnd while the soundtrack remains the same: \"She's your favorite!\" \"Why do you let him get away with that?!\" I stopped asking myself whether I was getting too lenient or too strict. I started asking a better question: What does this child need from me right now — not what did their sibling need at this age, not what I think I'm supposed to do, or how their sibling wishes I would handle it, but what actually helps this particular kid thrive. I no longer measure my consistency by how similarly I treat my kids, but by how attuned I am to each of them as individuals.\n\nIn the end, the thing my children have taught me, each in their own way, is that my job isn't to parent them the same way three times.

    "description": "Dick Van Dyke , who celebrated his 100th on Saturday,  hasn't shied away from sharing his advice for a long, healthy life.",
    "fullText": "Dick Van Dyke, the larger-than-life comedian, is now a centenarian.\n\nVan Dyke celebrated his 100th birthday on Saturday, marking a new chapter in his already storied life and career.\n\nHe became a household name in the 1960s while starring on the CBS sitcom, \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which won 15 Emmys and two Golden Globes. Van Dyke's star rose even higher when he headlined \"Mary Poppins\" alongside Julie Andrews in 1964 and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" with Sally Ann Howes in 1968.\n\nIn addition to an extensive filmography, Van Dyke also won a Tony Award in 1961 for his role as Albert Peterson in \"Bye Bye Birdie.\"\n\nAs Van Dyke grew older, he has often shared insights and advice on living a long life. Here are three tips Van Dyke follows.\n\nDuring an appearance on actor Ted Danson's podcast, \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name,\" in January, Van Dyke said he exercises several times a week.\n\n\"I've always exercised,\" Van Dyke said. \"Three days a week, we go to the gym. I think that's why I'm not stove-up like my equals.\"\n\nDanson recalled seeing Van Dyke at the gym and being impressed by his routine.\n\n\"I would go to the same gym you did, and if I got there early enough, I would see you, literally, work out on some weight machine,\" Danson said. \"And then, almost like you were doing circuit training, you would not walk to the next machine, you'd dance. You literally danced to the next machine.\"\n\nDanson said he later asked Van Dyke about his workout routine.\n\n\"You said you would come to the gym and work out for whatever hour, whatever it is, then you would go home. You would swim laps and then get back into bed and take a nap.\"\n\nVan Dyke said these days, he's doing a lot of stretching and yoga.\n\nIn his new book, \"100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life,\" Van Dyke wrote that his short-term memory is \"shot,\" but he still has \"his marbles.\"\n\n\"I used to do the crossword religiously for years (in pen), and now it's 'Jeopardy!' that keeps me sharp, though Arlene always has the answer before I do,\" Van Dyke wrote, referring to his wife, Arlene Silver.\n\nVan Dyke and Silver, 54, tied the knot in 2012. In his book, Van Dyke wrote that his job as an entertainer required him to have a good memory.\n\n\"For my whole career, I had to memorize pages and pages of lines and a ton of songs, backward and forward, so I was able to say or sing them without even thinking,\" he wrote. \"When I sing with The Vantastix, it's often songs from shows and movies I've done, and those are right at the front of my brain.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can still pick up new material easily, too, though it might take three or four more run-throughs than it used to be before the lyrics feel like second nature.\"\n\nVan Dyke also wrote that cutting alcohol out of his diet likely played a part in his good brain health.\n\nIn his book, Van Dyke recalled his former roles, including a series of old men, like Mr. Dawes Sr. in \"Mary Poppins.\"\n\n\"I'm not playing super-old anymore. I am super old. Speaking now from this position of centenarian authenticity, I can look back on my old man roles and say that some stuff I got right,\" he wrote.\n\nVan Dyke wrote that it's \"frustrating to feel diminished in the world, physically and socially,\" in addition to navigating the uncertainty of current global events.\n\nHowever, Van Dyke said keeping a positive outlook on life is key.\n\n\"I've made it to one hundred, in no small part, because I have stubbornly refused to give in to the bad stuff in life: failure and defeats, personal losses, loneliness and bitterness, the physical and emotional pains of aging. Because, as I see it, to do that would be to throw in the towel on life itself.\"\n\nInstead, Van Dyke said, \"for the vast majority of my years, I have been in what I can only describe as a full-on bear hug with the experience of living. Being alive has been doing life — not like a job, but rather like a giant playground.\"",

Jalibert conducted a devastating counter attack, linking up with France team-mates Damian Penaud and Louis Bielle-Biarrey.\n\nScarlets kept in the fight and the forwards showed great patience with Thomas eventually squeezing over.\n\nAnd while they looked to consolidate, Bordeaux managed one more before the break with Jalibert offloading to Tiaan Jacobs who rode the tackle before stretching for the line.\n\nScarlets defended heroically in the second-half as both sides introduced their benches early.\n\nAnd it took almost 20 minutes for Bordeaux to find a breakthrough after Sam Costelow held up an effort from a charging Temo Matiu.\n\nScarlets were reduced to 14 players with Jarrod Taylor's sin-binning and the damage was almost instant with Pablo Uberti one of several players queuing up to score out wide.\n\nStill a man down, Scarlets found their third try of the evening and it was another close-range effort from Anderson who is proving a valuable signing from Crusaders.\n\nBut slim hopes of a comeback took a significant blow as some tired defence saw Xan Mousques power over, with his effort quickly followed by a break away from Bielle-Biarrey, with Joey Carbery's conversion taking Bordeaux's score to half a century.\n\nScarlets desperately chased a try bonus-point in the dying minutes, but the defensive effort had taken its toll.\n\nBordeaux-Begles fly-half Joey Carbery said:\n\n\"Thankfully we got the result, especially after going away to Bulls last week.\n\n\"Training and playing [with players like Jalibert] you get to see how special they are. It's a privilege to be out here.\n\n\"To win in Europe is tough, especially at home we have to win these games, and I'm just thankful we have done that.\"\n\nScarlets head coach Dwayne Peel said:\n\n\"It is obviously disappointing that we didn't get anything out of the game, we were fighting hard for that fourth try at the end.\n\n\"I can't fault the effort of the boys, it was just our inaccuracies that hurt us out there, you can't allow a side of the quality of Bordeaux easy ins and I felt we did that at times.\n\n\"Our forwards carried strongly, I thought Fletcher Anderson at eight was excellent, he has been a really good signing for us.\n\n\"When we were in their 22 we took our tries well, it was just frustrating that the game got away through our inaccuracies.\"\n\nBoth sides return to festive league action before playing their final two Pool 4 games in January.\n\nBordeaux face Northampton Saints on Saturday, 10 January (15:15 GMT) and Scarlets welcome Pau in the day's later kick-off (20:00 GMT).\n\nEight days later Bordeaux are at Bristol Bears (13:00 GMT), while Scarlets travel to Northampton Saints (15:15 GMT).\n\nBordeaux-Begles: Mousques; Penaud, Uberti, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Page-Relo: Poirot (capt), Barlot, Falatea, Palu, Coleman, Jacobs, Vergnes-Taillefer, Matiu.\n\nReplacements: Everitt, Perchaud, B Tameifuna, J Gray, Gardrat, Retiere, Carbery, R Janse van Rensburg.\n\nScarlets: J Davies; Lewis, Roberts, James, Mee; Hawkins, Blacker; Hepburn, Van der Merwe, Thomas, Douglas, Ball, Macleod (capt), Davis, Anderson.\n\nReplacements: Elias, Mathias, H O'Connor, Lousi, J Taylor, A Hughes, Costelow, Page.\n\nReferee: Morne Ferreira (South Africa)\n\nAssistants: Griffin Colby & Christopher Allison (South Africa)\n\nTMO: Marius van der Westhuizen (South Africa).",

This tournament is the Super Bowl of darts so I would say this is a good moment.\"\n\nLim will face Luke Humphries in the second round after the 2024 world champion progressed with a 3-1 win over Ted Evetts in his opening match later on Saturday evening.\n\nHumphries had cruised into a 2-0 lead against his fellow Englishman before Evetts pinched a set back.\n\nHowever, 30-year-old Humphries regained his intensity and clinically finished out the contest with an average of 98.58, throwing eight 180s.\n\nLim, who thew the first world championship nine-darter at the BDO event at Lakeside in 1990, beat Humphries when the pair last met at the Ally Pally five years ago.\n\nOn meeting again, Humphries told Sky Sports: \"He's amazing, he's a legend. The crowd are going to be against me so it's going to be a tough game.\"\n\nLim said: \"I hope on a given day it can happen again. I never give up. He is good but he can be beaten.\"\n\nThe crowd roared on Lim, who is 72 next month, when he won the first set against De Graaf before his opponent levelled the match.\n\nLim went ahead again after a scrappy third set as De Graaf wilted while the experienced 'Singapore Slinger' held his nerve in a tense fourth, sealing victory with an average of 86.52.\n\nFive-time world championship semi-finalist Wayne Mardle said Lim was able to \"take his chances\" against De Graaf to secure an \"incredible\" win.\n\n\"If you have the desire, the passion but most of all the ability humans can achieve amazing things - and that was amazing,\" said Mardle on Sky.\n\nDe Graaf was six years old when Lim made his PDC debut 29 years ago.\n\nElsewhere, Wessel Nijman of the Netherlands eased to a 3-0 win over Czech Karel Sedlacek while Germany's Gabriel Clemens beat American Alex Spellman by the same scoreline.",

In general,\" before clarifying when asked if it was aimed at fans or the media: \"I love the fans and we are very happy with the fans.\"\n\nMaresca also highlighted Chelsea's injury and suspension issues, pointing out they had been without star attacker Cole Palmer for much of the season, as well as losing key midfielder Moises Caicedo to a three-match ban and striker Liam Delap to two significant injuries.\n\n\"I really praise the players and the squad because we played 16 Premier League games, five of them without Moises Caicedo, 11 of them without Cole Palmer, almost all of them without Liam Delap,\" he said.\n\n\"And this squad, no matter who is playing, they are doing fantastic. Today was five games in 12 days so for sure when you see Cole Palmer there, we said many times that he's our best player but we play almost all season without our best player.\n\n\"We play five games in the Premier League without Moises Caicedo. This is the reason why I'm so happy for the players and it's something that I would like people outside to appreciate because the effort from the players is fantastic.\"\n\nChelsea's victory over Everton consolidated their position in fourth in the Premier League table, with a Carabao Cup quarter-final at Cardiff and a league trip to Newcastle to come next week.",

Glasgow needed something to offer a glimmer of hope and they got it when some slick handling set McKay free up the touchline to run in for the try.\n\nWhether it was some strong words at half-time from head coach Franco Smith, or turning around to play with the wind now at their backs, a flick had switched and suddenly Warriors were putting it up to their illustrious opponents.\n\nThe Glasgow bench was making an impact and one of the substitutes, Brown, blasted over from close range to reduce the arrears to seven points and bring Scotstoun to life.\n\nThe roof nearly came off the place when Tuipulotu finished off an a period of intense pressure on the Toulouse line, and when Adam Hastings banged over the conversion we were all square.\n\nStill Glasgow came. They had Toulouse rocking and they landed another blow, a rolling line-out maul thundering over the try-line with substitute Hiddleston touching down to give Warriors the lead for the first time.\n\nThe great teams often find their way out a hole, but on this particular night, the Toulouse Galacticos had the fight knocked out of them by an inspired Glasgow Warriors side on a beautifully bonkers evening at Scotstoun that will live long in the memory.\n\nGlasgow: McKay; Steyn, McDowall, Tuipulotu, Smith; Hastings, Dobie; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, M Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Horne, Lancaster.\n\nToulouse: Ramos; Capuozzo, Costes, Gourgues, Kinghorn; Ntamack, Dupont; Ainuu, Marchand, Aldegheri, Brennan, Flament, Willis, Banos, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Lacombre, Neti, Merkler, Meafou, Castro Ferreira, Roumat, Graou, Thomas.",

Only for now, it seems.\n\nSalah will join Egypt in Cairo over the coming days as they prepare for the Africa Cup of Nations - but the message after manager Arne Slot's post-match news conference was clear.\n\nA line has been drawn when it comes to team selection.\n\n\"There is no issue for me to resolve,\" said Slot. \"For me, he is now the same as any other player. There is nothing for me to talk about after what happened against Leeds.\"\n\nIn his outburst at Elland Road last Saturday - where he claimed to have been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and had no relationship with his Dutch boss - Salah said this game against Brighton could well be his farewell.\n\nHaving been left out of the squad for the midweek Champions League win at Inter Milan, he came off the bench against the Seagulls as a 26th-minute replacement for the injured Joe Gomez.\n\nAnd the expectation now is very much that the 33-year-old will return to Liverpool next month after international duty.\n\nTalks are still planned between both parties while Salah is away but, a week on from his emotional interview at Leeds, he was all smiles in the mixed zone at Anfield as he walked past the media and was asked for a chat.\n\n\"Two weeks in a row? No, no,\" joked Salah.",
