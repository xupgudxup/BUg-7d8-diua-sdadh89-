    "title": "Arellano: Shea Serrano's 'Expensive Basketball' headlines remarkable year for Latino sports books",
    "description": "Gustavo Arellano highlights a special year for Latinos in sports, with Fernando Mendoza winning the Heisman and four strong sports books released.",
    "fullText": "When Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy this weekend with another Latino finalist looking on from the crowd, the Cuban-American quarterback did more than just become the first Indiana Hoosier to win college football’s top prize, and only the third Latino to do so. He also subtly offered a radical statement: Latinos don't just belong in this country, they're essential.\n\nAt a time when questions swirl around this country‘s largest minority group that cast us in a demeaning, tokenized light — how could so many of us vote for Trump in 2024? Why don't we assimilate faster? Why does Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh think it’s OK for immigration agents to racially profile us? — the fact that two of the best college football players in the country this year were Latino quarterbacks didn’t draw the headlines they would’ve a generation ago. That’s because we now live in an era where Latinos are part of the fabric of sports in the United States like never before.\n\nThat’s the untold thesis of four great books I read this year. Each is anchored in Latino pride but treat their subjects not just as sport curios and pioneers but great athletes who were and are fundamental not just to their professions and community but society at large.\n\nShea Serrano writing about anything is like a really great big burrito — you know it’s going to be great and it exceeds your expectations when you finally bite into it, you swear you’re not going to gorge the thing all at once but don’t regret anything when you inevitably do. He could write about concrete and this would be true, but his latest New York Times bestseller (four in total, which probably makes him the only Mexican American author with that distinction) thankfully is instead about his favorite sport.\n\n“Expensive Basketball” finds Serrano at his best, a mix of humblebrag, rambles and hilarity (of Rasheed Wallace, the lifelong San Antonio Spurs fan wrote the all-star forward “would collect technical fouls with the same enthusiasm and determination little kids collect Pokémon cards with.”) The proud Tejano's mix of styles — straight essays, listicles, repeated phrases or words trotted out like incantations, copious footnotes — ensures he always keeps the reader guessing.\n\nBut his genius is in noting things no one else possibly can. Who else would’ve crowned journeyman power forward Gordon Hayward the fall guy in Kobe Bryant’s final game, the one where he scored 60 points and led the Lakers to a thrilling fourth-quarter comeback? Tied a Carlos Williams poem that a friend mistakenly texted to him to WNBA Hall of Famer Sue Bird? Reminded us that the hapless Charlotte Hornets — who haven’t made it into the playoffs in nearly a decade — were once considered so cool that two of their stars were featured in the original “Space Jam?” \"Essential Basketball\" is so good that you’ll swear you’ll only read a couple of Serrano's essays and not regret the afternoon that will pass as quickly as a Nikola Jokic assist.\n\nI recommended “Mexican American Baseball in the South Bay” in my regular columna three years ago, so why am I plugging its second edition? For one, the audacity of its existence — how on earth can anyone justify turning a 450-page book on an unheralded section of Southern California into an 800-page one? But in an age when telling your story because no one else will or will do a terrible job at it is more important than ever, the contributors to this tome prove how true that is.\n\n\"Mexican American Baseball in the South Bay\" is part of a long-running series about the history of Mexican American baseball in Southern California Latino communities. What's so brilliant about this one is that it boldly asserts the history and stories of a community that too often get overlooked in Southern California Latino literature in favor of the Eastsides and Santa Anas of the region.\n\nAs series editor Richard A. Santillan noted, the reaction to the original South Bay book was so overwhelmingly positive that he and others in the Latino History Baseball Project decided to expand it. Well-written essays introduce each chapter; long captions for family and team photos function as yearbook entries. Especially valuable are newspaper clippings from La Opinión that showed the vibrancy of Southern Californians that never made it into the pages of the English-language press.\n\nMaybe only people with ties to the South Bay will read this book cover to cover, and that’s understandable. But it’s also a challenge to all other Latino communities: if folks from Wilmington to Hermosa Beach to Compton can cover their sports history so thoroughly, why can’t the rest of us?\n\nOne of the most surprising books I read this year was Jorge Iber’s “The Sanchez Family: Mexican American High School and Collegiate Wrestlers from Cheyenne, Wyoming,” a short read that addresses two topics rarely written about: Mexican American freestyle wrestlers and Mexican Americans in the Equality State. Despite its novelty, it’s the most imperfect of my four recommendations. Since it's ostensibly an academic book, Iber loads the pages with citations and references to other academics to the point where it sometimes reads like a bibliography and one wonders why the author doesn’t focus more on his own work. And in one chapter, Iber refers to his own work in the first person — profe, you’re cool but you're not Rickey Henderson.\n\n“The Sanchez Family” overcomes these limitations by the force of its subject, whose protagonists descend from Guanajuato-born ancestors that arrived to Wyoming a century ago and established a multi-generational wrestling dynasty worthy of the far-more famous Guerrero clan. Iber documents how the success of multiple Sanchez men on the wrestling mat led to success in civic life and urges other scholars to examine how prep sports have long served as a springboard for Latinos to enter mainstream society — because nothing creates acceptance like winning.\n\n“In our family, we have educators, engineers and other professions,” Iber quotes Gil Sanchez Sr. a member of the first generation of grapplers. “All because a 15-year-old boy [him]…decided to become a wrestler.”\n\nHeard that boxing is a dying sport? The editors of “Rings of Dissent: Boxing and Performances of Rebellion” won’t have it. Rudy Mondragón, Gaye Theresa Johnson and David J. Leonard not only refuse to entertain that idea, they call such critiques “rooted in racist and classist mythology.”\n\nThey then go on to offer an electric, eclectic collection of essays on the sweet science that showcases the sport as a metaphor for the struggles and triumphs of those that have practiced it for over 150 years in the United States. Unsurprisingly, California Latinos earn a starring role. Cal State Channel Islands professor José M. Alamillo digs up the case of two Mexican boxers denied entry in the United States during the 1930s, because of the racism of the times, digging up a letter to the Department of Labor that reads like a Stephen Miller rant: “California right now has a surplus of cheap boxers from Mexico, and something should be done to prevent the entry of others.”\n\nRoberto José Andrade Franco retells the saga of Oscar De La Hoya versus Julio Cesar Chávez, landing less on the side of the former than pointing out the assimilationist façade of the Golden Boy. Mondragón talks about the political activism of Central Valley light welterweight José Carlos Ramírez both inside and outside the ring. Despite the verve and love each “Rings of Dissent” contributors have in their essays, they don't romanticize it. No one is more clear-eyed about its beauty and sadness than Mondragón’s fellow Loyola Marymount Latino studies profe, Priscilla Leiva. She examines the role of boxing gyms in Los Angeles, focusing on three — Broadway Boxing Gym and City of Angels Boxing in South L.A, and the since-shuttered Barrio Boxing in El Sereno.\n\n“Efforts to envision a different future for oneself, for one’s community, and for the city are not guaranteed unequivocal success,” she writes. “Rather, like the sport of boxing, dissent requires struggle.”\n\nIf those aren’t the wisest words for Latinos to embrace for the coming year, I’m not sure what is.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

At this point the Browns are looking toward next season, and specifically at Shedeur Sanders and whether he has a shot at being a starter in the league.\n\nSanders’ best target so far has been rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr., but last week he only put up 48 yards on a whopping 14 targets against a not great Bears defense.

    "fullText": "Alongside a strong campaign with Carly Williams’ side, McKenzie is driving forward her business, McKenzi3Kickz, aimed at closing the gap between grassroots and academy football for girls, with education, mentorship and opportunity the focus.\n\nFounded in 2008 by journalists Leon Mann and Rodney Hinds, the Football Black List highlights leaders from all areas of the game, with nominees put forward by the public before a panel featuring representatives from the Premier League, English Football League, Football Association, League Managers Association and Kick It Out finalise the list. McKenzie’s recognition places her among figures who are making a meaningful impact both within football and beyond it.\n\n“It’s something I’m really proud of,” McKenzie said. “To be recognised in that way means a lot, not just for what I’m doing on the pitch, but for the work I’m trying to do to help others. It shows that people are paying attention and that the message is landing.”\n\nMcKenzie joined Brentford Women in the summer of 2025 and has been a key figure in Williams’ side this season. She has registered six goals and one assist in 12 appearances across all competitions, playing an important role as the Bees remain firmly in the promotion mix.\n\nAway from matchdays, McKenzie is also the founder of McKenzi3Kickz, a business created to help girls who want to play football overcome accessibility barriers within the game. Through workshops and events supported by Go London, she has secured £15,000 of funding alongside 12 months of mentorship, enabling her to scale the project and focus on long-term impact.\n\n“That support has allowed me to really push forward with my bigger vision,” she explained. “A lot of the barriers for girls come from a lack of access to information and guidance, and that’s what I want to change.”\n\nA central part of that vision is the development of a dedicated app for young players in the women’s game, designed to create a safe community space focused on mentorship, education and support. McKenzie plans to host an interview series within the platform, speaking to physiotherapists, psychologists, grassroots and academy coaches, performance staff and nutritionists.\n\n“I believe what women need is support, and it shouldn’t just be academy players who get it,” she said. “Grassroots players deserve the same education around injury prevention, nutrition, rehab, and how to prepare for trials. If we start teaching the younger generation now, they’ll be in a much better place when that big opportunity comes.”\n\nMcKenzi3Kickz also runs an annual tournament for both Under-16s and Over-16s, giving girls the chance to attend individually or as part of a group. With prizes, raffles and the hope of showcasing an early version of the app, the tournament provides valuable exposure at a time when summer opportunities for girls’ football can be limited.\n\n“There’s a lack of tournaments for girls during the summer,” McKenzie said. “This gives coaches a chance to come and spot talent, parents a chance to support their children, and players a space where they feel seen. My aim is to help close the gap between academy and grassroots football and make that transition more accessible.”\n\n“I believe what women need is support, and it shouldn’t just be academy players who get it'\n\n“I study sport rehabilitation, so I see how important it is that the right investment goes into the right areas.\n\n\"Being able to go into schools and share that knowledge is a huge opportunity for me.”\n\nLooking ahead, McKenzie is optimistic about the future, with plans for one-to-one support sessions and five-a-side opportunities forming part of the next phase of McKenzi3Kickz in 2026.",

The team felt it could use him to put heat on some of its own players on defense.\n\nBuy FIRE THE CANNONS: 50 Years of Tampa Bay Buccaneers Football\n\nThe Bucs didn’t just need an edge rusher. They needed an edge, someone whose passion might boil over into an opponent’s penalty. A teammate they would watch with a side-eye, never fully sure what he might do next. A player who made opponents uncomfortable and injected an attitude the locker room couldn’t manufacture.\n\nIn addition to an overall lack of consistent pressure from their defensive line and outside linebacker positions, the Bucs lack someone teammates are afraid to let down.\n\nThink about the best Bucs teams from the past. The Super Bowl 37 champions were stuffed with those kinds of players on defense. Warren Sapp. Even safety John Lynch, who is about as even-tempered off the field as anyone you will ever meet, was borderline maniacal between the lines. He knocked his brother-in-law (Bears tight end John Allred) out cold in a 1997 game at Soldier Field.\n\nHardy Nickerson was that guy when Lynch, Sapp and Derrick Brooks arrived.\n\nIt also helps that Pierre-Paul has a resume. He owns 94 ½ career sacks and 21 forced fumbles. Outside linebacker Yaya Diaby leads the Bucs with only six sacks this season.\n\nLess than two weeks after Pierre-Paul was signed to the practice squad, Diaby says he’s benefited from the two-time Super Bowl champion’s counsel.\n\n“It’s been good so far, man,” Diaby said. “I can’t even lie. He’s very intentional with what he’s done and what he sees that we’ve been doing that he can improve upon. Even for me, he’ll come up and say, ‘This is what you can do to get off real faster. You could’ve done this or done that.’\n\n“So, he’s been real intentional in trying to share whatever he can. Even (Wednesday), he was telling me, ‘I don’t know everything. But what I do know, I can help you with that.”\n\nOn Saturday, Pierre-Paul was elevated from the practice squad for Sunday’s game at Carolina. Head coach Todd Bowles had said earlier in the week that Pierre-Paul was “in play” for the NFC South showdown, even with no players forced to miss the game due to injury.\n\n“I think he’s coming in and getting back acclimated systematically in some of the things we’re asking him to do,” defensive pass game coordinator George Edwards. “But I think he’s been very attentive. It’s bought into calling some of the plays he’s done in the past. He’s here working hard, so we’ll see how it goes. You never know when your number is called to be in those situations.”\n\nPierre-Paul’s energy and passion for the game is infectious, Diaby said.\n\n“He loves it, and he’s still got some juice,” Diaby said. “He’s still got some juice.”\n\nThere’s been far too many miscommunications on the Bucs defense this season. Much of it is on the players. Some of it is opponents going fast to prevent an array of blitzes and coverages to be communicated before the snap.\n\nIt’s one of the reasons why there have been so many missed assignments, a player out of position here or there because the communication breaks down.\n\nBowles always has been known for the complexity of his defense and the ability to disguise an array of blitzes. But those take time to communicate.\n\nConsequently, opponents are getting to or staying on the ball quickly between snaps.\n\n“On third down, they speed it up some,” Bowles said. “We expect that. We’ve been getting that for the last two years. We have to have calls ready. We understand that, and we do have calls ready. We expect to get sped up some.”\n\nThe Bucs and Panthers are both 5-1 in games decided by three points or less this season.\n\nWhat makes them able to execute in pressure situations?\n\n“it’s just playing smart football,” Bowles said. ”We have to play smart football, and you can’t beat yourselves and you’ve got to execute.”\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills’ dramatic Week 15 victory over the New England Patriots was far more than a simple rivalry win; it was a season-saving, division-defining statement.\n\nTrailing 21-0 in the first half at Gillette Stadium, quarterback Josh Allen led the Bills on a historic comeback, scoring five consecutive touchdowns to erase the deficit and secure the thrilling 35-31 win. The victory was crucial, as it prevented the Patriots from clinching the AFC East title on their home turf and kept Buffalo's own slim division hopes mathematically alive heading into the final three weeks of the season.\n\nMore importantly for their immediate postseason aspirations, that massive win cemented the Bills (10-4) as the leading Wild Card contender in the highly competitive AFC playoff picture. Currently holding the No. 6 seed, Buffalo’s favorable tiebreakers give them a strong foothold as they enter a demanding closing schedule. With the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans nipping at their heels, maintaining momentum is essential to avoid being dragged back into the desperate fight for the final playoff spots.\n\nThat urgency brings the Bills to Cleveland this Sunday for a pivotal matchup against the Browns (3-11). While Cleveland has struggled through a disappointing season, their defense —led by the perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate Myles Garrett —remains highly disruptive. The quarterback battle is one to watch: Shedeur Sanders will make his fifth NFL start against the reigning MVP in Josh Allen.\n\nUltimately, Sunday's clash at Huntington Bank Field is an absolute \"must-win\" for Buffalo. Having survived the biggest challenge of their season by battling back against the Patriots, the Bills cannot afford a letdown against a struggling opponent if they want to secure their spot in the postseason for a seventh straight year. A win would keep the pressure squarely on New England in the AFC East race and put Buffalo on the very brink of officially punching their ticket as the top team in the AFC Wild Card standings.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channel 227 (home), 382 (away)\n\nBrowns radio channel: 92.3 The Fan, 98.5 WNCX and ESPN 850, The Cleveland Browns Radio Network\n\nThe matchup between the Browns and Bills can be found nationally on SiriusXM (channel 88), along with team-specific channels. The Bills can be found on 382 and the Browns on 227.\n\nLocally, fans in the Buffalo area can tune into WGR 550, which carries Bills games throughout Western New York.

    "description": "There’s a lot of praise to be found for the Orioles doing something else aggressive.",
    "fullText": "There are now 95 days remaining until Orioles Opening Day 2026. If this weekend is any indication, things are not going to be sleepy from now until Christmas or even from then until the new year. Does Mike Elias have another (perhaps the last) substantial move in him before the calendar turns?\n\nA couple of days after the Shane Baz trade, in some ways I feel like I did after the Orioles signed Pete Alonso. I can’t believe that it happened! This is not something that Elias has done before now, making a big trade that included multiple players who might have been regarded among the team’s top 10 prospects in an aggressive deal to try to shore up one of the team’s weaknesses for seasons at a time.\n\nHe is serious about doing something different this year. Going out and getting Baz is of a much different character than settling for short-term signings of Tomoyuki Sugano and Charlie Morton. There is an upside here that not much of what he did last offseason had going for it. My efforts to talk myself into the Baz trade center largely around how much better he was on the road this past year (3.86 ERA), which will hopefully prove to be a more representative floor for his performance than his results from George Steinbrenner Field – a minor league stadium that won’t be in use in 2026 and won’t be Baz’s home park in any case.\n\nEven so, I’d like to see the Orioles go in and aim for the top end of the free agent market. If they go out and get whoever they like the best between Framber Valdez, Ranger Suárez, and Tatsuya Imai, and then turn out to be right about that guy, that would set up a potentially pretty darn good rotation for the team. Crucially, they would be in a position to have much better backup plans than they did a year ago, too. I think there’s going to be some movement coming in the top end even as we slide towards Christmas and then the new year.\n\nIf you can imagine this, everybody has still got a lot to say about Shane Baz!\n\nElias on Baz: “I think he’s kind of a perfect fit for us in our rotation and our team right now? (School of Roch)\nOrioles believe Baz to be a No. 3 starter, but more additions not out of question (Orioles.com)\nAt long last, Mike Elias and the Orioles are taking big swings this offseason (The Baltimore Banner)\nWhat they’re saying about the Orioles trade for Shane Baz (Baltimore Baseball)\n\nYou don’t have to look very far in the mainstream baseball media to find people who like Baz and what the Orioles are aiming for in this deal.\n\nToday in 1995, the Orioles signed future Hall of Famer Roberto Alomar to a three-year contract. Alomar averaged about 4.2 bWAR per season of the contract. Two of those years were 1996 and 1997, great years for the franchise. Pretty good signing!\n\nThere are several former Orioles who were born on this day. They are: 2019-20 pitcher Asher Wojciechowski, 2012-13 catcher Taylor Teagarden, 2006 reliever LaTroy Hawkins, 1995 outfielder Andy Van Slyke, 1996 pitcher Roger McDowell, and 1977 outfielder Elliott Maddox. Today is Maddox’s 78th birthday, so an extra happy birthday to him.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: dog breeder Jack Russell (1795), actress Jane Fonda (1937), musician Frank Zappa (1940), actor Samuel L. Jackson (1948), tennis star Chris Evert (1954), and French president Emmanuel Macron (1977).\n\nIn 1620, the pilgrims from the Mayflower came ashore in what is today Plymouth Rock, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1879, the play A Doll’s House by Henrik Ibsen had its world premiere in Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1913, a new thing called the “word-cross,” designed by Arthur Wynne, was published in the New York World. This was the first published instance of what we now know as a crossword puzzle.\n\nIn 1988, all 259 passengers and crew of Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground were killed when a bomb exploded in the plane and the wreckage crashed onto Lockerbie, Scotland.\n\nAnd that’s the way it is in Birdland on December 21.

    "fullText": "It doesn't have to be conventional -- if it works.\n\nDenver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix has turned heads this season with no-look throws, falling-down touchdown passes and various unconventional throwing angles. He's been discouraged from playing like that since he was a kid -- even by his father, Patrick Nix, who coached him in high school.\n\n“I think I've always been able to do it,\" Nix said of his unique throws. \"It was probably from playing baseball as a young kid to playing football, and just a lot of different backyard styles of play. But early on in your career, a lot of people told you that wasn't how you were supposed to do it, and you had to do it a different way, my dad being one of them. So you work to be on platform and to throw it with the perfect mechanics every time. Sometimes it works that way, and you get to do it and other times it doesn't. I think the ability to be able to use different angles just helps you within the pocket, helps you navigate windows.\n\n\"It can be tough on a defense. They can't really time you up and get batted passes or just gives you another opportunity if they got a hand in your face, whatever it may be. It's just like a shooter getting a shot off in a different way, getting to the rim, and having a shooter lay up in a different spot. Every once in a while, you want to be in a perfect shooting position, but sometimes that doesn't happen, and so have to have a different angle or whatnot. I think it's a strength that a lot of guys are working on, and I think it's just going to get more and more creative honestly as guys move forward.”\n\nOne of Nix's off-platform throws was a whipped pass to tight end Evan Engram against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. Engram plucked it out of the air with one hand to help keep things alive on a crucial drive.\n\nBo Nix hits Evan Engram who snags the ball with one hand\n\nSweet game yesterday!\n\n(excuse the audio equipment) pic.twitter.com/6GMaFYfbkj\n\n— BroncoBlog (@MileHighDubs88) December 15, 2025\n\nMost underrated play from Sunday imo\n\n3rd and long early, drive in jeopardy, need a TD to take the lead.\n\nBo gets the ball out awkwardly, narrowly avoiding Parsons, Engram snags it with one hand, sheds a tackle and gets us to 4th and 1, leading to a sneak and later a TD that… pic.twitter.com/hTZ0M9BT31\n\n— Bryce 🎸 (@MileHighMims) December 16, 2025\n\n“Sometimes it's just athleticism, sometimes it's just a reaction,\" Nix said. \"At that point, my eyes saw Evan as open and my body reacted to getting him the football as quickly as possible. I think it just, you know, automatically went to a way of throwing that I could do, but the fastest one that I had. It's cool to go back and watch those and you're like, ‘Man, I didn't even realize it looked like that or didn't even realize that's what I did.’ Sometimes it's just sudden movements, and you train your body to be quick. You definitely have to practice that way. You have to practice full speed at all times, try to get different looks at it. But that ended up being one of the most important plays in the game.”\n\nNix and Co. now turn their attention toward the Jacksonville Jaguars, who will visit Empower Field at Mile High on Sunday. With a win (and some help from other teams), the Broncos can clinch an AFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the conference this weekend.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Coaches (including his dad) discouraged Bo Nix's backyard style",

Derwin James can do that to you. But, Ferguson continues to see good usage. He hasn’t topped 60 receiving yards since Week 3, so we would very much like for him to score a touchdown this week in our fantasy playoffs.\n\nThe good news is that Ferguson has still been getting looks in the red zone, with five RZ targets over his last four scoreless games.

The Cowboys have a sliver of a chance at sneaking into the playoffs, while the Chargers are in at the moment, but can’t let off the gas just yet.\n\nRunning back Kimani Vidal played well in RB Omarian Hampton’s absence and now that Hampton has returned, Vidal has continued to play more snaps than the rookie, but Hampton has more touches. In the two games since he returned, Hampton has seen 31% and 36% of the snaps to Vidal’s 69% and 64%. In total touches, Hampton has 15 and 16 to Vidal’s 15 and 13.\n\nBelow, we’ll go over Omarion Hampton’s outlook in fantasy football for Week 16.\n\nThe split between Hampton and Vidal is based on the “hot hand” approach so far, which doesn’t give us much to go on. Hampton did see more short yardage work while Vidal saw more third-down work, but toward the end of their Week 15 game, Vidal took over a big chunk of all the plays.\n\nI’d say we can count on them splitting work, with a lower floor for both, but still decent upside as well, just a little more inconsistent than we’d hope. The Cowboys have been better against the run since acquiring Quinnen Williams, but we also just saw the Lions rush for four touchdowns against them.\n\nWilliams is in concussion protocol, but has returned to limited practices.

    "fullText": "The 6-8 Kansas City Chiefs travel to Nashville on Sunday to take on the 2-12 Tennessee Titans. The Chiefs are just 3-point favorites against the lowly Titans because they lost Patrick Mahomes to a season ending ACL/LCL tear. Gardner Minshew will take over Mahomes, which has shrunk their implied team total to 20.5. If Mahomes was behind center, I’d expect that number to be 27 or more. So, Minshew will likely slow down the offense, but does that mean you should bench TE Travis Kelce?\n\nBelow, we’ll go over Travis Kelce’s outlook in fantasy football for Week 16.\n\nKelce has been much better than I thought he would be this season. He looked completely washed for much of last season, but he’s proven me wrong and put up strong fantasy numbers. It also helps that Andy Reid can scheme him open and that Mahomes and Kelce have a great connection. Now with Minshew in there, we can wonder if Kelce will see a big decline or keep up his usual stats.\n\nWhat we have going for Kelce is that Minshew is going to dink and dunk, much like Mahomes, and he’s going to try to get the ball to Kelce. Plus, the Titans defense is not good. Over the last three weeks they’ve given up strong games to George Kittle, Harold Fannin Jr. and Brenton Strange. I just don’t see Minshew not using Kelce as his security blanket in this one.",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- The matchup between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night featured a matchup between the 2025 draft's No. 1 pick in Mavericks forward Cooper Flagg and the No. 3 pick in Sixes guard VJ Edgecombe.\n\nThe two delivered a terrific showing as Edgecombe had 26 points, six rebounds, and four assists while Flagg delivered 24 points and four rebounds as Philadelphia earned a 121-114 win on the second night of a back-to-back. It was a strong showing for two of the draft's top classmates.\n\nAfter the Sixers knocked off the Mavs, the two rookies exchanged jerseys as a sign of respect for what both can do.\n\n\"It was great,\" Edgecombe said of the battle with Flagg. \"We’ve been going against each other since high school. College even, we ran into each other. Now in the league. I’m happy for him. He finally found a rhythm. Obviously, he had a shaky start kind of, but to see him play through it and continue to grow, that’s amazing, man. Credit to Coop.\"\n\nEdgecombe and Flagg matched up in the NCAA Tournament back in March when Flagg's Duke team eliminated Edgecombe's Baylor squad in the Round of 32. Edgecombe was able to get a bit of revenge against Flagg at the NBA level leading the Sixers to another win. Flagg gave a lot of love to Edgecombe after the contest.\n\nCooper Flagg on his showdown with VJ Edgecombe:\n\n\"I think we both played a solid game. He played a really good game. He was aggressive. Got to his spots & rose up. I knew that's what he was capable of. He's a great player. Been playing against him for a couple years live now,…\n\n— Mike Curtis (@MikeACurtis2) December 21, 2025\n\nEdgecombe was part of a closing lineup on Saturday that played the final 13 minutes of the contest. He, Tyrese Maxey, Jared McCain, Jabari Walker, and Adem Bona were able to get the job done and put the Mavs away.\n\n\"We all just locked in,\" Edgecombe said. \"Regardless of fatigue or not. We all just locked in. Credit to Mac coming onto the court and 'Bari and Bona coming onto the court and making big plays. Mac was plus-29. That's a big difference right there, man. Credit to them, man. Bona played well, and then Tyrese, obviously, is Tyrese.\"\n\nThe Sixers will have two days off before taking on the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: VJ Edgecombe discusses battle with Cooper Flagg after Sixers beat Mavs",

If Higgins is out, I feel pretty good about Gesicki and would start him. But if Higgins can play, it makes things a little tougher. I still like Gesicki’s upside with Fant out though,\n\nThe Dolphins have allowed the third-most fantasy points to tight ends this season and Gesicki had a strong game two weeks ago against a good tight end defense in Buffalo. Last week he did bupkis, but nobody on the Bengals did much of anything as they were shutout by the Ravens. I’d of course prefer Higgins was out if I’m playing Gesicki, but I think I’d start him either way.",

The Titans are just 3-point underdogs to the now Patrick Mahomes-less Chiefs, so this matchup looks much different than we expected when perusing the schedule early on. Of course, the Chiefs till have an above average defense and the Titans don’t have much offense to speak of, as they’ve averaged just 16 this season.\n\nOf course, even on bad teams, fantasy points will be scored. Of late, tight end Gunnar Helm has shown some fantasy upside with Two top ten fantasy games over his last four games. Has he shown enough to be startable in the fantasy playoffs though?\n\nBelow, we’ll go over Gunnar Helm’s outlook in fantasy football for Week 16.\n\nHelm has caught four or more passes in four of his last five games and has shown himself to have a decent fantasy floor. A touchdown last week, his second of the season, helped boost him. And he has four red zone targets over the last three games.\n\nThe Chiefs rank fifth-best in fantasy points allowed to tight ends and Helm shares time with Chig Okonkwo. For the fantasy playoffs I would really prefer a tight end who consistently leads the team in tight end snap percentage. Helm also is more of a short catch and fall down kind of receiver. He’s not going to give you a whole lot after the catch.",

It’s not out of the realm of possibility of course, and the good news is that they’ll be in the warmth of Miami and playing a bad Bengals defense. Cincinnati has been good against outside receivers while giving up a million fantasy points to tight ends, but Waddle does get moved around enough to get him away from the boundaries.\n\nThere is risk involved here, but if anyone is going to get pelted with targets it’s going to be Waddle and his ability should take things from there.",

    "fullText": "Gian Piero Gasperini has done nothing to deny his disappointment towards Evan Ferguson, and his words sound like a transfer message for Brighton and Manchester United.\n\nSafe to say Roma coach Gasperini is unhappy with Irish striker Ferguson.\n\nThe Brighton loanee contributed to Roma’s only goal against Juventus on Saturday, but Gasp was still unhappy with his performance and, overall, attitude.\n\nGLASGOW, SCOTLAND – NOVEMBER 06: Gian Piero Gasperini, Head Coach of AS Roma, looks on prior to the UEFA Europa League 2025/26 League Phase MD4 match between Rangers FC and AS Roma at Ibrox Stadium on November 06, 2025 in Glasgow, Scotland. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images)\n\n“Ferguson is still not convincing me, including in the second half today,” Gasperini told Sky Sport.\n\n“It’s not just his technique; he and a few other new signings still haven’t settled fully into the spirit of this team.”\n\nA few minutes later, he added at a press conference attended by Football Italia: “If I have to choose between Dybala and Ferguson, I’d choose Dybala every time. It’s not about Ferguson; it’s a choice I’ve made before, and if that’s the choice, I choose Dybala.”\n\nFerguson joined Roma on loan with a €35m option to buy from Brighton last summer, but the 21-year-old has only scored three goals in 17 appearances across all competitions this season.\n\nIt’s no secret that Roma are looking for a new centre forward in the January transfer window, and Football Italia reported earlier this week that Giacomo Raspadori has already given the green light for a move to the Olimpico, although Gasp’s priority remains Manchester United’s forward Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nGasperini had previously claimed that Ferguson would have time to prove his worth at the Olimpico, but with the January window approaching, the Italian tactician seems to have lost patience with the Irish striker, who is clearly not seen as a starter by Gasp.\n\nUnder such circumstances, it would not be surprising to see Roma send Ferguson back to Brighton in the January window, a scenario that even the English club’s coach Fabian Hurzeler refused to rule out just a few days ago.\n\nGasperini seems to have lost faith in Ferguson, but he’d still need one or, ideally, two reinforcements in attack in the winter transfer window before sending the Irish striker back to England, a move that would also require Brighton’s approval.\n\nNOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND – APRIL 01: Joshua Zirkzee of Manchester United looks on as he walks out of the tunnel to inspect the pitch prior to during the Premier League match between Nottingham Forest FC and Manchester United FC at City Ground on April 01, 2025 in Nottingham, England. (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nGasperini also argued that he won’t necessarily need a classic centre-forward to play up front, given that even using Dybala as a false nine is a better option than fielding Ferguson.\n\nNeither Raspadori nor Zirkzee is are classic centre-forward, but their dynamism and ability in the link-up play will suit Gasperini’s playing style. The Italian tactician already wanted to sign both players at Atalanta in the past, and he certainly hopes that both can move to the Olimpico next month to boost Roma’s hopes to finish in the top four.\n\n“We must aim to improve, and I hope the January transfer window can help us do that. It’s not easy, but we have to believe,” Gasperini concluded last night.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona could part ways with one or two players in January, as they seek to continue cutting down their wage bill. Marc-Andre Ter Stegen is a prime candidate to move on, given that he is not in Hansi Flick’s plans for the second half of the season.\n\nTer Stegen recently made his return to action in the victory over Guadalajara in the Copa del Rey, but Flick has Joan Garcia and Wojciech Szczesny as first team goalkeepers for the 2025-26 campaign. Because of this, he’s been told he can leave, which he will need to do if he wants tpostart for Germany at next summer’s World Cup.\n\nA number of clubs have been linked with Ter Stegen, and among them is Bayern Munich. However, Christian Falk has now shut down any chance of a move to Bavaria for the Barcelona captain.\n\n“He’s a really good goalkeeper, but there are no meetings taking place within the club to discuss him signing for FC Bayern. There is an interesting set of circumstances at the club. As we know, Jonas Urbig is considered the backup and eventual successor to first-choice Manuel Neuer. Urbig also shares the same agent as Ter Stegen, so they don’t want to bring a rival into the club.\n\n“That all said, Ter Stegen knows he has to move if he wants to play in the World Cup for Germany. This is why there is so much speculation around his future. I think an idea like Manchester United, for example, is more plausible. Otherwise, there are many interested clubs; Besiktas would be a relatively easy move for the Barcelona star in order to get playing time, as he has no chance of playing next year for Barca; Hansi Flick is very clear on this position.\n\n“Neuer is still, firmly, the number one goalkeeper at Bayern Munich, so it wouldn’t make any sense to bring Marc-André ter Stegen in. He’s already been sitting on the bench for the German national team behind Manuel Neuer, and he won’t do it at Bayern!”\n\nBayern may not be in the race, but Ter Stegen has numerous options. Several clubs in the Premier League want him, and regular playing there would certainly give him an excellent chance of being Germany’s staring goalkeeper at the 2026 World Cup.",

    "description": "Who Patriots fans should be rooting for in Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots will try to get back into the win column this week versus the Baltimore Ravens. Naturally, all of our attention is on that particular Sunday night matchup. That said, some of the other 15 games around the NFL this week are also worth keeping a close eye on.\n\nWith that said, welcome to this week’s Patriots rooting guide.\n\nAs a disclaimer, we are looking at games through two primary lenses: New England’s chances of winning the division — which they cannot do this week — as well as earning the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Naturally and given the tiebreaker situation, not every game will be equally important even if it involves common opponents or other teams in the conference or division.\n\nThe Patriots were entering the weekend with a 73% chance of winning the division, according to The Athletic, and are 99+% favorite to make the playoffs (they actually can punch their ticket on Sunday). Their odds for the No. 1 seed are not nearly as good and a mere 10% at the moment.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7) at Carolina Panthers (7-7): Go good game! Division supremacy on the line, but the Patriots do not care who will win this one. | FOX\n\nBuffalo Bills (10-4) at Cleveland Browns (3-11): Go Browns! The Patriots won’t lock up the division this week either way, but Buffalo dropping this one would give them more wiggle room: if the Bills lose and they beat the Ravens, the Patriots would be up two games with two weeks to go. | CBS\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (10-4) at Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1): Go Cowboys! The Chargers entering the competition for the No. 1 seed in the AFC is unlikely but not entirely impossible. This is merely based on keeping another competitor away from the race for the first-round bye in the conference. | FOX\n\nCincinnati Bengals (4-10) at Miami Dolphins (6-8): Go Dolphins! Miami is out of the playoffs, so all wins do over the last three weeks is further weaken the team’s draft position. | CBS\n\nNew York Jets (3-11) at New Orleans Saints (4-10): Go Jets! This is the same we talked about with the Dolphins, namely that the Jets adding some more wins down the stretch would end up hurting their draft stock. | CBS\n\nMinnesota Vikings (6-8) at New York Giants (2-12): Go good game! This all-NFC matchup has no impact on the Patriots. | FOX\n\nKansas City Chiefs (6-8) at Tennessee Titans (2-12): Go Titans! The more games the Chiefs end up losing, the better for New England: they own a Kansas City sixth-rounder next year courtesy of the Joshua Uche trade. The worse their record, the better positioned the pick. | CBS\n\nAtlanta Falcons (5-9) at Arizona Cardinals (3-11): Go good game! Nothing to see here, really. | FOX\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (10-4) at Denver Broncos (12-2): Go Jaguars! This is a big one. If the Patriots want to take over the No. 1 seed in the AFC, they will need Denver to start losing some games. This one against the red hot Jaguars is a realistic candidate. | FOX\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (8-6) at Detroit Lions (8-6): Go Lions! The Steelers missing out on the playoffs would be good news for the Patriots and the sixth-round draft pick they received as part of the Kyle Dugger trade. Obviously, in an ideal scenario, Pittsburgh would still be ahead of the Ravens after Week 16, but a loss here would keep the chances intact of Baltimore eventually leap-frogging their division rivals and pushing them out of postseason contention. | CBS\n\nLas Vegas Raiders (2-12) at Houston Texans (9-5): Go good game! Even though this is a game between two AFC teams, including one competing for a playoff spot, the game has no real impact on New England. | CBS\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (10-4) at Indianapolis Colts (8-6): Go Colts! We end the week with a focus on draft positioning. In the unlikely case the 49ers drop out of the playoff picture in the NFC, the Patriots would benefit: the conditional sixth-round pick acquired in the Keion White trade would be better positioned in that case. | ESPN\n\nThe following games have taken place earlier in the week:\n\nLos Angeles Rams (11-3) at Seattle Seahawks (11-3): Go good game! Given the stakes, this is one of the top Thursday night games in recent memories. And while it has no impact on the Patriots, it should be a fun watch nonetheless. | LA 37, SEA 38 (OT)\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (9-5) at Washington Commanders (4-10): Go good game! A no-impact game from a Patriots perspective. | PHI 29, WAS 18\n\nGreen Bay Packers (9-4-1) at Chicago Bears (10-4): Go Packers! While the game won’t change New England’s playoff outlook, it could end up impacting the draft. The Patriots, after all, own the Bears’ fourth-round pick sent to them by the Chiefs as part of an in-draft trade last year. | GB 16, CHI 22 (OT)\n\nThis article also serves as an open thread for this week’s games. Please head down to the comment section to discuss and share your thoughts on the games as they unfold.",

    "fullText": "All eyes are on Myles Garrett this week as he is 1.5 sacks away from claiming the all-time NFL sack single-season record. He will be chasing that record this week, but beyond Garrett, the Cleveland Browns defense will be a huge factor in the game against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nWhile sacks will be a priority for Garrett, it is known that Josh Allen can extend plays with his legs, so the Cleveland pass rushers will need to prioritize limiting him in these situations rather than just aiming for sacks. If they can keep Allen in the pocket, they may be able to limit Buffalo’s explosive offense.\n\nThe Bills are built to score often and quickly, so limiting explosive plays will be crucial for the Browns’ defense. There needs to be an emphasis on tackling and limiting big gains that will allow Buffalo to move down the field quickly. Cleveland’s offense struggles when playing from behind, making it crucial for the defense to avoid putting the team in that situation.\n\nIn every game, third-down stops and stops in the red zone are always a key to keeping the Browns in games, and it is no different for this game. Limiting the Bills to field goals and forcing them to punt will keep the Browns competitive.\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments – What are the keys for the Browns defense in limiting the Bills offense?",

    "fullText": "Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season continues on this afternoon with an NFC South battle for first place featuring the Tampa Bay Buccaneers visiting the Carolina Panthers at 1 p.m. ET on FOX.\n\nThe Panthers held on to the NFC South lead for less than 72 hours before squandering it in a 20-17 loss to the Saints last Sunday, falling back behind the Bucs due to the common opponent tiebreaker. They did get a productive outing out of Coker and they are going to need him to come through with another good performance in this crucial home showdown.\n\nBelow, we’ll go over Coker’s outlook in fantasy football for Week 16.\n\nCoker made an impact in last Sunday’s loss to the Saints, leading the team in receiving by catching all four of his targets for 60 yards and a touchdown. That trip to the end zone gave the Panthers a 10-point lead in the third quarter and that proved to be the end of their scoring for the afternoon as the Saints marched their way back into the contest and nailed a game-winning field goal with two second left.\n\nThis marked the second straight game with a touchdown for the second-year wideout from Holy Cross and he’s really coming on as a reliable weapon for Bryce Young in the last month. He’s been uber reliable with a 75.9% catch rate, ranking ninth among his peers in that category. We’ll see if he can step up yet again in this showdown.\n\nStart. Given how the Bucs defense has been shredded through the air in recent weeks, I like the young receiver’s chances of finding the end zone again in today’s matchup. I’d give him a Flex nod in your lineup if you have him.",

    "fullText": "Last night, on his 27th birthday, Kylian Mbappé reached 59 goals in the calendar year (his first full year) with Real Madrid: equaling Cristiano Ronaldo's record from 2013.\n\nA special moment for the Frenchman, who has reached his lifelong idol. That's why he celebrated just like him, talked about it in the post-match interview, and tagged him on social media.\n\nAfter scoring the penalty for the 2-0 against Sevilla, Mbappé \"borrowed\" CR7's celebration to mark his 59 goals in the calendar year, which cannot be increased further, since Real Madrid's next match will be on January 4th.\n\nAfter all, it's not the first time Mbappé has imitated Cristiano Ronaldo—just think back to his presentation day, when he said in front of the Bernabeu: \"Un, dos, tres... Hala Madrid!\"\n\nAfter last night's goal, Mbappé himself wanted to pay tribute to CR7: \"Cristiano helped me adapt to Real Madrid. We talked a lot. It was great. I have my own way of celebrating, but I wanted to dedicate this goal to him.\"\n\nAfter the match, Mbappé made a post on Instagram with photos of his celebration, the caption \"Believe in your dreams, champ!\" and an image that has now become iconic: a very young 13-year-old Kylian together with Cristiano Ronaldo. The occasion was a multi-day trial at Valdebebas with Real Madrid, which ultimately did not result in a transfer.\n\nCR7 himself commented on the post: just a few simple emojis, but they sum up the excellent relationship between the two, now united by the same number of goals in a calendar year. 59—no one else has done it like them at Real Madrid.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "We break down the fantasy football outlook of Troy Franklin ahead of the Broncos’ Week 16 matchup vs. the Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season continues on this afternoon with an AFC matchup with playoff implications as the Jacksonville Jaguars will visit the Denver Broncos at 4:05 p.m. ET on FOX.\n\nThe Broncos downed the Packers in a big-time 34-26 victory over the Packers last Sunday and can secure the AFC West title with a win and a Chargers loss this afternoon. Wide receiver Troy Franklin came up huge for the team last week and they’ll need another great performance out of him against another playoff contender in this one.\n\nBelow, we’ll go over Franklin’s outlook in fantasy football for Week 16.\n\nFranklin delivered one of his better performances of the season against the Packers last Sunday, catching all six of his targets for 85 yards and a touchdown in a victory that clinched the Broncos the AFC’s first playoff spot. It was the first game of the season where he had a perfect catch rate and his 23-yard touchdown reception as time expired in the third quarter ended up putting the Broncos ahead for good.\n\nThat effort allowed Franklin finish the week as a top-10 fantasy wideout in all scoring formats, marking the third time this season where he’s pulled that off. The second-year wideout from Oregon continues to be an effective weapon for Bo Nix and it will be interesting to see if he can keep it up against the Jags this afternoon.\n\nSit. A couple of things should be noted here for this matchup. First, fellow wideout Pat Bryant will be returning from a hamstring injury for this showdown and that should impact the number of targets and snaps Franklin will get this afternoon. Second, the Jags secondary have been effective against WR2’s and WR3’s this season, holding them to less than 45 receiving yards per game. Unless you’re pressed for options at this point in the playoffs, I’d sit Franklin down for this game.",

    "title": "The mayor of a New York City suburb says building apartments on parking lots near train and bus stations is a key to reining in rent",
    "description": "New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert talked with Business Insider about how her NYC suburb is building lots of new housing and keeping costs down.",
    "fullText": "In a year full of abundance discourse, New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert is living the abundance agenda.\n\nThe skyline of her Westchester County city, just 20 miles north of Manhattan, is barely recognizable from a decade ago. New apartment and condo towers have shot up, the city's population is booming, and rents and home prices haven't risen nearly as fast as in other cities in the region and across the US.\n\nThe city plans to fulfill its goal of adding 11,000 units in about 32 buildings in several years, growing the city's housing stock by 37%, according to the Wall Street Journal. The mayor told Business Insider the city is about two-thirds of the way to its goal.\n\nAnd the efforts are showing signs of success. Median rents in New Rochelle rose by just 7% between 2017 and 2023, according to a Pew analysis of Apartment List data. That's compared to a 31% median rent increase nationwide.\n\nOver the last decade, the city has supercharged housing construction by overhauling zoning laws, streamlining environmental review, and offering new tax breaks to developers. The city has focused on revitalizing its downtown by building homes on underutilized commercial and parking lots near rail and bus stations.\n\n\"We weren't tearing down homes. We weren't tearing down existing apartment buildings,\" Ramos-Herbert said in an interview this fall with Business Insider. \"We were just leveraging underutilized sites and catalyzing them through the development.\"\n\nThe new homes don't just impact New Rochelle's 85,000 residents. They have implications for the entire region, which is suffering from one of the most severe housing shortages in the country. New York City relies on its suburbs to house a big portion of its workers and absorb a steady stream of people leaving the five boroughs.\n\nWhile the Big Apple builds less housing per capita than most other major cities in the US, many of its suburbs have an even more dismal record. Between 2010 and 2021, the New York suburbs approved just 13 new homes for every 1,000 residents — about half the rate of the Big Apple.\n\nThere's been some opposition to all the new construction in New Rochelle among locals. There are concerns about traffic, lack of parking, and noise from construction sites. But her constituents also worry that the shiny towers are being filled with transplants, rather than New Rochelle locals in need of affordable housing.\n\nThe mayor said that gentrification concerns are overblown. She noted that 22% of the residents in the new housing are from New Rochelle, and 21% are from surrounding towns in Westchester County. That's compared to 33% who've come from New York City. The new units have given locals a smaller home to downsize to, or a way to shorten their commute by living within walking distance of an Amtrak and Metro-North rail station, she said.\n\n\"These are not strangers. These are our friends. These are your kids' friends,\" she said. \"These are your parents.\"\n\nThe city has been hailed as a model for communities that need to boost housing production amid severe affordability challenges. New Rochelle isn't alone in the region — Jersey City has also built housing at a rapid clip in recent years, becoming another model for YIMBYs to point to.\n\nRamos-Herbert's advice to other cities and communities: start by building transit-oriented development on underutilized commercial plots.\n\nShe also touted the critical income the new housing and residents bring in for the city through property taxes and sales tax, allowing it to invest in infrastructure and programs that benefit everyone. She pointed to the $100 million renovation of the city's train station and the transformation of a highway that divides a historically Black neighborhood into a linear park and local road.\n\n\"You can only tax so much,\" she said. \"We have to kind of create, ensure, proactive creation of alternative revenue streams to support us.\"",

    "title": "I'm a career coach for Big Tech employees. Here are my 4 tips for dealing with a micromanaging boss.",
    "description": "Kyle Elliott, a career coach, said employees who think they have a micromanaging boss should try learning their triggers and looking inwards.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 33-year-old Kyle Elliott, a career coach who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a full-time career coach for around eight years, and struggling with a micromanaging boss is a common issue clients come to me with.\n\nI used to run resident halls at a university, but in 2017, I left that job to start coaching full-time, going on to complete several coaching certifications. I previously studied health education and public administration in the tech-heavy areas of San Francisco and Seattle, so I've gained many clients in tech over the years.\n\nThey work at both fast-growing startups and big companies like Google and Meta, in a range of roles from product to engineering and HR. In a typical week, I meet 12 to 15 clients, usually in 50-minute online calls.\n\nI think micromanaging bosses seem common among my clients because many leaders were accustomed to being hands-on with technical problems earlier in their careers, but haven't since learned to delegate well. With all the layoffs in this industry, leaders may also be worried about losing their jobs, which can lead them to become more controlling.\n\nVenting about your boss isn't going to change how they act, so when I'm dealing with these situations, I try to help clients focus on what's within their control, such as improving their own communication and confidence.\n\nHere are my four tips if you think your boss is a micromanager:\n\nMicromanaging bosses often struggle to relinquish control, and when clients challenge their micromanaging behavior, bosses sometimes act out by yelling or ghosting them. Sometimes, it can even result in the boss doubling down on the problematic behaviours being challenged, making working with them more difficult.\n\nOne of my clients realized their CEO would often get upset when employees questioned their decisions. My client couldn't change their boss's trigger, but we devised a solution to help them avoid being the source. My client would gather peers and, together, present the CEO with solutions, rather than questions. Tiptoeing gently around the CEO meant their defensiveness wasn't triggered, and in turn, they weren't as micromanag-ey.\n\nIt's good to reflect on any themes that make your boss upset. Is it when reports are due, or around an investor meeting? There's no excuse for bad behavior. But noticing these triggers can help you avoid activating them, making them less likely to respond with micromanaging and controlling behavior.\n\nIf your boss is overly involved in your work life and you address every single thing that annoys you, they could feel attacked and get defensive, which could activate their controlling behavior.\n\nOne client would spend up to two hours debating with their boss in meetings without accomplishing anything. So consider what your ultimate goal is when you're giving your boss feedback to conserve your energy and minimize the chance they'll blow up.\n\nIdentify two to three things that, if solved, would make a significant difference to your happiness and focus on bringing about those.\n\nYour boss being strict about you coming in at 8 a.m., not 8.15 a.m. like you would prefer, probably isn't worth fighting over. However, I would fight for something like taking a weeklong vacation if that's very important to you, but your boss isn't big on PTO.\n\nLook to people in your organization who work well with your boss, and try to work out why.\n\nOne of my clients struggled with a very micromanage-y boss who was adamant about having things done their way. The client worked on a team of three, and noticed they were usually the only one getting into disagreements with their boss.\n\nI asked them if they worked differently with the boss, and they realized that they would speak up in important meetings, unlike the other two. The two colleagues confirmed this by sharing with my client that they had a more passive approach. The less they spoke in meetings, the less opportunity their boss had to control them.\n\nYou might be doing something to upset your boss without realizing it. Checking in with other people can provide new insights. Start with an office bestie or people you trust. However, you don't want to come across as gossipy, so if you feel safe to talk to your boss directly about your feelings, start there instead.\n\nYour boss may not actually be a micromanager. Instead, you might be getting triggered by past experiences, like memories of a past micromanaging boss.\n\nIf you've found yourself triggered by something your boss said in an email or during a meeting, try asking colleagues how they responded to determine whether everyone finds your boss's communication unreasonable.\n\nIf it's something only you're feeling, try to find ways to ground yourself in these moments, for instance by taking a short walk or setting a 5-minute timer before responding to your boss.\n\nMaybe you can bring a solution to your boss. When one client struggled because they felt they were responding to Slack messages from their boss all day, I encouraged them to ask if they could respond at the end of the day. To my clients' surprise, their boss was happy with this arrangement; they'd just never brought it up.\n\nSometimes, you can be so focused on the other person that you forget to look inward and determine how to improve things yourself.\n\nIt's often difficult to provide honest feedback to a micromanaging boss, as they don't tend to create a safe environment for this.\n\nIf you're still having more bad days than good at work after trying direct, honest communication with your boss and the other tips I've mentioned, it could be time to walk away from your job.\n\nDo you have a story to share about navigating tricky dynamics with your boss?

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz's electric CLA is priced $5,000 above the premium trim of the Tesla Model 3 — for an entirely different driving experience, BI found.",
    "fullText": "Calling a car, especially an EV, \"software-defined,\" when it's not a Tesla or Rivian can feel like a trap; it exposes a carmaker to some misleading or unhelpful comparisons.\n\nAt a media event with Mercedes-Benz earlier this month, I heard company representatives use the same phrase — \"software-defined vehicle\" or SDV — to describe the new CLA, Mercedes' entry-level EV, which starts at $47,250.\n\nThe CLA will be the launch platform for Mercedes' new MB.OS operating system, which will include an AI voice-assistant powered by both ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Drivers will interact with the new software interface through a screen that stretches across the entire dashboard. There are nearly 40 inches of display, including the driver's seat. It's a lot of screen.\n\nThere's also an advanced driver assistance system, which has become standard in modern vehicles. Mercedes plans to launch MB.DRIVE Assist PRO next year, which is supposed to share some of the ADAS functionalities as Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised.\n\nAs I heard Mercedes employees talk about the new CLA, I couldn't help think: Here's another legacy automaker now trying to play catch-up with major EV players.\n\nThat was before I got behind the wheel.\n\nI had the chance to drive the new CLA for about two hours around San Francisco. A week later, I demoed Tesla's premium trim of the Model 3, which is about $5,000 less than the entry-level CLA option.\n\nMercedes' new EV is no Tesla. Far from it. But, after my drive, I'd say it doesn't have to be.\n\nMy demo CLA didn't come equipped with Mercedes' MB.Drive Assist Pro, which is designed to be a Tesla FSD-level ADAS — essentially, supervised self-driving from the parking lot to the destination.\n\nStill, I was curious to try the Level 2 ADAS that came equipped in the car. A Mercedes spokesperson told me the latest update should provide a \"smoother overall driving experience with traffic light recognition and stopping.\"\n\nThe feature can be more comparable to Tesla's Autopilot, which provides steering assist, lane change assist, and recognizes traffic lights.\n\nIn a city like San Francisco, where there can be a lot of turning and stopping, relying on the ADAS felt a little tedious. I had to take over the wheel or press the brakes quite a bit to make a turn or wait for a pedestrian to cross.\n\nHowever, there was a crystal-clear moment in my drive when I realized my desire for an ADAS, which essentially drives for me, is secondary.\n\nPart of my test drive included traveling up O'Shaughnessy Boulevard, a long, winding road in San Francisco that leads to the Twin Peaks area.\n\nThe road in front of me was clear. I wasn't sure what was going on with the ADAS, whether it was on or \"suspended.\" So at one point, I disengaged the driver assist and pressed the pedal to see how it handled the curvy roads.\n\nReader — the CLA is a lot of fun to drive. Even in the busier city streets, the CLA's compact profile and torque from its electric powertrain made weaving past slower cars enjoyable — something an ADAS can't do, at least not yet.\n\nAnd that's a huge point that helped me overcome this mental reflex to compare the CLA to the Model 3.\n\nIn a Tesla, the driving experience can feel secondary to the technology.\n\nOutside the steering wheel, there's little else getting in between the driver and the large touchscreen, which is Tesla's goal.\n\nThe EV maker aims for most interaction between the car and the driver to occur through the screen. After all, Tesla's ultimate technological endgame is full autonomy. The bug or user error is the act of driving itself.\n\nWith the CLA, I felt Mercedes made a car that you'd prefer to drive — and everything from the premium-level interior to the AI voice assistant only helps you focus on that act.\n\nPart of the feeling is buoyed by the brand itself: There's something wholly uncool about spending 50 grand or more on a sporty Mercedes-Benz only to say that you don't really drive the thing.\n\nThat's not the most rational defense for buying a car. However, Mercedes itself almost advertises the CLA as an emotional experience rather than a rational purchase.\n\nSee how the German automaker talked about the CLA in some of its early press material: \"The most emotional vehicle in its class,\" \"sensual purity,\" and the \"style rebel\" that \"underscores the sporty side of the Mercedes-Benz brand.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called his cars a \"very sophisticated computer on wheels.\"\n\nWe're talking about very different audiences here.\n\nThe CLA does throw up some numbers that are competitive with the leading EV players: an EPA-estimated range of 374 miles, 268 horsepower, and a 10% to 80% charging time of 22 minutes for the CLA 250+ model.\n\nThe premium rear-wheel drive Model 3 I drove has an EPA-estimated range of 363 miles. Tesla doesn't break down horsepower or charging time the same way Mercedes does, but, according to Kelley Blue Book, most Tesla models can charge to 80% around 15 minutes.\n\nMercedes also plans to introduce a hybrid variant of the CLA, utilizing the automaker's new \"modular architecture.\" This is essentially the skateboard platform that EV companies use, allowing them to build other models efficiently on the same foundation.\n\nMercedes is just one of many legacy automakers that are now hedging their bets on EV-only segments and expanding hybrid options.\n\nIf the vast majority of consumers continue to remain uncertain about electric cars, Tesla is unfortunately boxed out of that game.",

    "description": "Kameron Buckner says that dating as a busy startup founder in NYC is difficult, but certain boundaries and rules help her balance work and romance.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kameron Buckner, a 32-year-old startup founder based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a startup founder in NYC, dating is a struggle. I've noticed that some men want a woman who's a little bit more accessible throughout the week, and I've accepted I'm just not going to be that person.\n\nI have a rule of thumb right now: I won't date another early-stage founder. We can't both be fighting for our lives.\n\nMy work is demanding, and I can't be the spontaneous girl that a lot of men are looking for — I need a partner who understands that my startup is sometimes going to be my priority.\n\nI have my moments where I can meet up for a last-minute coffee, but most of the time, I'm a schedule-oriented girl. I'm all about laying out expectations and making it clear that my capacity to prioritize my relationship will fluctuate.\n\nI was a practicing attorney in a law firm for a year before realizing it was not the life I wanted to live. In 2024, I created Social Docket, an AI-powered platform designed to provide modern legal infrastructure for the creator economy.\n\nWhen I moved to New York a couple of years ago, I tested out the dating apps, but the men I saw didn't take good pictures, and it's really hard for me to get a feel for someone I haven't met in person. I've realized I prefer meeting people through friends or at an event.\n\nI'm also fast at weeding people out if I don't see it working out, meaning I'm very decisive about who I date. I don't have time to go on 10 dates to figure out if I like someone.\n\nIf someone asks what my week looks like, I'll give them the next two weeks, so we can plan the date, time, and activity. It's similar to how I plan meetings: I want to get them on my calendar.\n\nSome men seem to like it because it shows I'm willing to make time for them, but for others, I'm just not for them, and that's OK.\n\nIt sounds like I'm hiring, but I'm looking for someone who takes initiative. I work extremely hard in my business, so I appreciate someone who tells me the time and place to meet or provides me with a list of places to choose from. Someone who makes it simple.\n\nIf I'm in a busy season with work, it's nice to have a partner who can break up the fog of entrepreneurship and kindly remind me that he'd like to have some quality time together. There are times that I'm so locked in, and I do have to wake up a little bit.\n\nAt the same time, there will be moments when my partner can't be my priority. They have to understand that, as a founder, I'm actively fundraising and need to be committed. It doesn't mean I don't care, but I need to take a step back from our quality time.\n\nI might say, \"Hey, I have 15 meetings this week. I'm not going to have that much time to see you, but I'm down to do a FaceTime before bed.\"\n\nFiguring out how to learn and adapt to each other is one of the fun parts of finding a partner.\n\nThere have been times when people have made comments about my career, and I view them as a reflection of how they feel, whether it's a result of intimidation or self-consciousness.\n\nI opened up to an ex about my goal to one day make a million dollars in my company, and his first response was to question me and tell me it was greedy. He knew my heart, and for that to be the first thing he said was a real eye-opener to his character.\n\nI pay close attention to what the men I date say in the beginning and how they react to my success, because if it's an issue at the start, it's probably going to be an issue at the end. I've learned there's nothing wrong with walking away from people, even if it's just for a \"small\" reason.\n\nI think a good partner should want to see you succeed, because what's mine is yours. In a healthy partnership, both parties benefit and improve each other.\n\nI know the right partner will appreciate my ambition and drive, and let me come home to be the soft, feminine version of myself. They'll love both parts of me. With a foundation of humor, friendship, and support, everything else will just fall into place.\n\nDo you have a story to share about dating as a tech founder?

    "description": "From tariff rebate checks, to bonuses, to Trump accounts, to DOGE dividends, here's all the free money Trump has floated giving to Americans.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump really wants to send you a check.\n\nThroughout his second term, Trump has pledged to send Americans money in various ways, including tariff rebate checks and bonuses to select government employees.\n\nSome of that free money is becoming a reality: Congress created \"Trump Accounts\" as part of the \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which will provide tax-free federal grants of $1,000 to children born in the next few years.\n\nOthers remain elusive, or have fallen by the wayside. Remember the DOGE dividend?\n\nTrump also sent out checks during his first term, but under much different circumstances. As part of two successive COVID-era stimulus bills, the federal government sent Americans $1,200 in the spring of 2020 and $600 in the winter, shortly before the president left office.\n\nTrump's signature appeared on those checks, which was a source of controversy during a presidential election year.\n\nIn February, investor James Fishback floated the idea of sending $5,000 \"DOGE Dividend\" checks to almost 80 million taxpaying American households.\n\nThose checks would be paid for by spending cuts achieved by DOGE, the government efficiency office led by Elon Musk at the time.\n\nThe idea quickly caught Musk's attention, and Trump eventually said that they were under consideration.\n\nBut there were some problems. For one, the $5,000 figure was based on Musk's original estimate of $2 trillion in savings, which never materialized.\n\nRepublicans in Congress also balked at the idea, saying they preferred to see a reduction in the national debt.\n\nThe idea eventually faded, though Trump's political operation has continued to float the idea in fundraising emails.\n\nWhile defending tariffs in a November Truth Social post, Trump said his administration would pay \"everyone\" except \"high income people\" a dividend of at least $2,000.\n\nAlthough Trump's Truth Social posts are not actual government orders, the statement drew attention from citizens and his colleagues in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget published an analysis the following day, stating that there would not be enough tariff revenue to support the idea.\n\n\"With our national debt quickly approaching an all-time high and annual budget deficits approaching $2 trillion per year, it is imperative that policymakers focus on actually reducing deficits and putting debt on a downward path,\" the committee wrote.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent also pushed back on Trump's dividend remark during an ABC News interview, saying there were no plans to spend tariff revenue.\n\nTrump would also need approval from Congress to pass such an order, which seems unlikely given the lack of enthusiasm from Republican members.\n\n\"We're facing a deficit this year around $2 trillion,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, told reporters. \"I think whatever revenue we get, from whatever source, ought to go to try and bring down those deficits.\"\n\nThe longest government shutdown in US history began on October 1, spanning 43 days while Democrats and Republicans in Congress negotiated a new budget.\n\nThe fallout forced the government to furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers, while others — such as air traffic controllers — had to continue working without pay ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday rush.\n\nAir traffic controllers received their first $0 paychecks in late October. Some of them stopped showing up for work, sparking a staffing shortage and an onslaught of flight delays and cancellations.\n\n\"They're confronted with a decision: Do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent, or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions,\" Duffys said. \"I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, criticized the air traffic controllers who had not shown up for work during the shutdown in a November Truth Social post.\n\n\"For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe said air traffic controllers who didn't take time off during the shutdown were \"GREAT PATRIOTS\" and he would recommend a $10,000 bonus for each of them.\n\nDuffy shared more details in an X post, writing that 776 air traffic controllers would receive $10,000 bonus checks in early December.\n\n\"Santa's coming to town a little early,\" Duffy wrote.\n\nTrump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" into law on July 4, implementing new tax policies and changes to federal programs, including SNAP.\n\nThe bill also introduced so-called Trump Accounts, which are specialized retirement accounts for US children. They were previously referred to as \"money account for growth and advancement,\" or MAGA accounts.\n\nThe Trump administration said children born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, who open Trump Accounts, would receive a one-time $1,000 tax-free federal grant. US children with a valid Social Security number are eligible. Friends, family, and others are allowed to deposit another $5,000 tax-free into those accounts.\n\nThe White House said several CEOs agreed to invest in Trump Accounts, including Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\nIn December, Michael and Susan Dell pledged to invest $6.25 billion to support Invest America, the federal program that spearheaded Trump Accounts.\n\nHedge fund manager Ray Dalio has also pledged to deposit $250 into the Trump Accounts of 300,000 Connecticut children. Some large companies, like BlackRock, have offered a $1,000 match for the children of eligible employees.\n\nDuring an economic address to Americans in December, Trump said his administration would provide bonus checks to members of the military before Christmas.\n\nIn a subsequent news release, the newly rebranded Department of War said Trump is giving service members bonus checks to \"thank them for their military service and to commemorate the 250 years the US military has been defending the nation.\"\n\nThe checks, dubbed the \"Warrior Dividend,\" are each worth $1,776.\n\n\"Money to pay for the Warrior Dividend came earlier this year as part of the president's One Big Beautiful Bill. Approximately 1.28 million active-duty and 174,000 reserve component military members will receive the dividend as a nontaxable supplement to their regular monthly housing allowance,\" the Department of War said.\n\nThe department said eligible service members can expect to see the payment before December 20.",

    "description": "Erik Smolinski says a key to his success lies in his organization. He keeps a detailed trading plan and trading log — and monitors his progress through AARs.",
    "fullText": "Erik Smolinski started trading stocks as a teenager in 2007.\n\nOver the past nearly two decades, the Marine veteran and full-time trader posted just two negative years — his first two — and, between 2018 and 2022, returned 24.6% on average. Business Insider verified his claims by looking at screenshots of his summary statements.\n\nSmolinki's strongest year was 2023, when he returned triple digits. In 2025, he said his portfolio has returned 79% and he's on track to hit his third-strongest year in the market.\n\nA key to his success lies in his organization.\n\nHe keeps a detailed trading plan and trading log — and he frequently monitors his progress through after-action reviews (AARs).\n\nHe prefers monthly AARs, plus one big annual review that can take him up to two weeks. It's a chance for him to look at what went well within his portfolio, what didn't, and how he can improve moving forward. Plus, not everything that's worked in the past will necessarily work in the future, and the AAR helps him recognize when he should make adjustments.\n\n\"For a very, very long time, growth stocks outperformed large-cap stocks,\" he explained. That doesn't mean growth stocks will always do better than large-cap stocks. \"If I continue just operating off of that lens, and I don't have a methodology to check in and see if that still holds true, then all I'm going to do is underperform, especially as you start to see tech absolutely dominating just about everything in the last half-decade.\"\n\nThe AAR helps him recognize key shifts in the market and decide whether to change his strategy.\n\n\"I have different strategies and profit mechanisms that are designed to do different things — some of them are fairly persistent, and some of them are not, which means some of them will make good money when they work, but then they won't always work,\" he said. \"You have to know when to stop doing those things and pivot to something else.\"\n\nThe way he sees it, as a full-time trader, he's running a business: \"And guess what big businesses do? They have quarterly earnings reports. What is that? That's an AAR.\"\n\nThe everyday investor can benefit from AARs. Rather than setting and forgetting your investments, check in on your portfolio frequently — once a quarter or once a year, at least.\n\n\"Set a calendar event for yourself, ideally on a weekend,\" he said. That way, \"you're not bombarded with other stuff in life and you can actually carve out this little bit of time that you're not going to punt. Set it up and respect it.\"\n\nStart your AAR by looking at your returns.\n\n\"For the regular investor, a great thing to compare your performance against is SPY, QQQ, IWM, TLT, and GLD,\" he said. \"Compare your performance of your holdings against those five tickers and just ask yourself, 'Am I cool with this? Do I think that I'm set up appropriately?' And if so, great, you don't have to do anything.\n\n\"But, you might find that the mutual fund you're in is actually sucking the soul out of your account, causing a higher cost, lower returns, and you might make a change.\"",

    "description": "Danny Moses, one of the traders featured in \"The Big Short,\" thinks the AI bubble is real. He shares advice on how to avoid getting burned.",
    "fullText": "Since Michael Burry launched a Substack in November, he's been sharing plenty of investing insight, but he isn't the only \"Big Short\" trader who has something to say about the current market landscape.\n\nDanny Moses, the former member of FrontPoint Partners, the firm led by Steve Eisman that successfully bet against the housing market in 2008, spoke to Business Insider about the potential problems he sees developing in the AI market and how he thinks investors should navigate the rapidly evolving space.\n\nAs the AI boom has unfolded, many finance pros have weighed two primary questions: Is there a bubble in the AI market, and if so, should it be compared to the dot-com era of the early 2000s?\n\nMoses thinks the answer to both questions is yes. While he doesn't deny that the AI trade is real and a secular growth story, he also sees strong parallels between the two tech crazes that suggest investors need to tread cautiously.\n\n\"The growth was real, but the math didn't work,\" he said. \"And I think that we're reaching a point where the math is starting not to work.\"\n\nMoses emphasized that his take on potential AI market problems isn't a call to short the industry. Rather, he noted it's a call for investors to do their homework and find the right names to gain valuable exposure as the market continues to grow.\n\nIn his view, that means sticking with the tech sector's most dominant names that have the resources to continue scaling and aren't bound by the same constraints that some smaller companies are. The best examples include Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\"They can turn down their capex at any point, and they're still cash flowing positive, as opposed to these other companies, which are dependent upon that spending within AI,\" he said.\n\nMoses isn't bullish on all of Big Tech's top names, though. He cited Oracle as an example of problems within the AI market, noting the company's high debt levels and the cash that it will require the fulfill the orders from tech clients. He also highlighted volatile tech stocks Super Micro Computer and CoreWeave as examples of riskier plays within the AI trade.\n\nIn his view, though, investors are finally starting to account for the fact that not all AI stocks are created equal as the divide between relative outperformers and underperformers becomes increasingly hard to ignore.\n\n\"I think it's proof that investors are beginning to sort out the winners and losers of the trade, and they'd much rather have comfort and other businesses with stronger balance sheets to fall back upon to express the AI theme,\" Moses added.\n\nHe also said that he's bullish on uranium, as the metal is being increasingly touted as a key component of the AI buildout that will be necessary to sustain the industry in the coming years.\n\nThat said, he thinks the timeline for when it will start to spur growth is one that investors should be paying close attention to, as it is sometimes misunderstood amid the AI hype.\n\n\"One of the trades that I like is uranium, which thematically, should work, but it takes a long period of time,\" Moses said. \"There's a mismatch in the timing of how people think that companies will experience AI growth and actually the infrastructure that it's going to take to power it.\"",

    "title": "'Every day something's coming down the pipe': How the CEO of Booking Holdings responds to a crisis",
    "description": "Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel told Business Insider that the company's experience navigating crises helps it respond to new challenges.",
    "fullText": "Many companies have navigated recent economic and geopolitical uncertainties — but the CEO of travel conglomerate Booking Holdings has faced a steady stream of crises over the last two decades.\n\nTo name a few: the dot-com bubble, 9/11, the 2008 market crash, SARS-1, volcanoes, tsunamis, the pandemic, tariffs, and various wars. CEO Glenn Fogel told Business Insider there's something happening in the world every day.\n\n\"Every day something's coming down the pipe,\" Fogel said.\n\nPart of dealing with a crisis involves planning in advance whenever possible. For example, Fogel explained that when tensions started to heat up between Russia and Ukraine, a region where the company operates, they began to prepare contingency plans \"just in case.\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine became public just hours after the company's earnings call in February 2022. As the situation developed, Booking Holdings supported employees abroad and navigated expected sanctions. That led to the company's decision to suspend travel services in Russia and Belarus in March 2022, the company said.\n\nFogel, who's been with the company for over 25 years, isn't a stranger to navigating complicated situations. He outlined his crisis response approach, starting with the people he keeps on speed dial to how he manages stress.\n\nWhen a crisis arises, Fogel said the first people he contacts are the company's executive officers, including the general counsel, chief financial officer, and chief HR officer.\n\nNext, he works to identify the problem and which part of the business it affects. As a global travel conglomerate, Fogel said issues can impact different regions in different ways.\n\nThe CEO added that the company's long history of navigating challenges has helped it respond effectively when new problems arise. He said he reminds himself that there is an end to every crisis. For example, with COVID, he said he didn't know when a vaccine would come out, but he knew one eventually would.\n\n\"It helps you've already been through a lot before,\" Fogel said. \"It's not the first rodeo.\"\n\nWhen it comes to managing the stress of the job, Fogel said he practices meditation.\n\n\"I'd like to do it every day,\" Fogel said.\n\nHe said his other non-negotiable is exercise, which he always does before work nearly every day. Fogel does light weightlifting year-round and swims in the summer.\n\nEven when he's traveling — which is more often than he's home, he said — he makes time for a workout at his hotel, squeezing in email responses during lower-intensity sessions.",

    "description": "Cameron Kirkconnell went from spearfishing and guiding for the wealthy to buying and selling yachts for them.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Cameron Kirkconnell, a world-record spearfisher who works as a yacht broker with Ikonic Yachts, based in Miami. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was really young, somebody asked me what I wanted to do for a living, and I said, \"I want to fish and hunt.\" My father was a lawyer, and my whole extended family is lawyers. Before that, everybody had been ship captains.\n\nAfter I got out of the Maritime Academy, I started working on the ships. I have the absolute highest license you can get, so I can captain anything in the world. I worked on oil tankers, oil drilling, break bulk, cargo ships, container ships, and some military contracts.\n\nI love spearfishing, so I got very good at that and was traveling a lot during my time off. In the early 2000s, we had forums, so we'd meet people around the world and travel and spearfish together. I ended up working for one of the biggest spearfishing companies in the world, designing gear. It created this incredible network around the world. My aunt told me when I was in my teens that if I could ever figure out how to make money by networking, I'd do very well.\n\nI had an opportunity to start guiding spearfishing about 13 or 14 years ago, and that just took off. My initial niche was the finance world. Everybody that I work with is very successful and at the absolute pinnacle of whatever business it is. The allure of spearfishing is that when you're doing it, there's nothing else you can think about.\n\nThe way we do spearfishing is breath-hold diving. So we hold our breath, and we go down, and we try to shoot fish, and then we bring them back to the surface. The base of the partnership with a dive buddy is that trust with them. Because if you and I are in the water together, you're there to make sure nothing happens to me, and I'm there to make sure nothing happens to you.\n\nMy clients told me they wanted me to start buying and selling their boats. They said I know more about boats than anyone they've ever met, and that they literally trust me with their lives. I can't tell you how many of the boats that I buy, the clients never step foot on until it's bought, because they trust me that much.\n\nI'm very decisive, and I'm very confident in my abilities because of all of the years leading up to it and understanding the personalities and the people that I'm working with. Being able to mesh that with picking the right boat and seeing the right deal out of a hundred is pretty unique.\n\nThere are surprising similarities between spearfishing and yacht brokerage. The ultimate satisfaction from guiding spearfishing is at the end of the day, you get a high five or a hug from the client and your buddy. With brokerage, when you finally get the right boat, and they say, \"You were right, this is amazing, thank you.\" I'm also not trying to act any differently or change who I am. When I first got into this, I bought two suits, and I have not worn either of them once.\n\nPeople ask how to become a yacht broker. I could never have planned the path that I have taken. But I would say get as much experience as possible across the board. Start at the bottom, scrubbing decks. It's all about relationships.\n\nThe relationships are the most valuable asset that I have, and you're not just going to cold call people and get that. Life's too short not to do cool stuff and to be surrounded by good people. Treat people fairly, keep it simple, stay transparent, and genuinely look out for others, not just yourself.",

    "description": "Sergio Avedian started his career as a Wall Street trader before becoming a rideshare driver. Now, he makes videos for The Rideshare Guy on YouTube.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sergio Avedian, a 58-year-old ride-hailing driver for Uber and Lyft in Southern California. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in Istanbul, Turkey, to Armenian parents. I went to high school in Germany and later came to the US for college.\n\nI was always interested in finance, so I ended up becoming a trader at a boutique Wall Street firm. I saw the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. After I retired from my day job in 2005, I was looking for things to keep myself occupied. Algorithms fascinated me because I had seen widespread automation in the world of finance.\n\nIn 2016, I was getting lunch with a friend who was telling me about this app called Uber. My friend said, \"I think they use algorithms.\" Curiosity got the better of me, and I started reading about it and meeting drivers to learn more. Eventually, I signed up as a driver myself in the Los Angeles area.\n\nBack then, Uber was offering $1,000 bonuses to sign up as a driver. I also earned up to $80 an hour.\n\nBut what really intrigued me were the parallels with trading. On Wall Street, we used to say that \"a trend is your friend\" because you could make money if you caught one early enough.\n\nPicking ride-share trips was like that. You had to know when and where trip prices would surge. That meant, for example, I had to position myself in Santa Monica between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., because prices would usually be higher there at that time.\n\nI've also spent the last several years writing articles for and making videos with Harry Campbell, who has a YouTube channel called The Rideshare Guy. I've been working with Harry since about 2018, with a break during COVID when demand for rides went down.\n\nI think Uber, Lyft, and the other gig work apps are wonderful. They've created massive opportunities for people. But I also don't want the people who make these services work each day to get left behind. The people who do this work need to start saving for their future.\n\nThat's why my latest project is a personal finance website and YouTube channel. It's not just for gig workers, but they're a big part of the audience. They don't have access to the same benefits that employees do, such as retirement benefits.\n\nOne piece of advice I've been giving drivers: At the end of your shift, do one extra trip, then put the money from that trip in an account and don't touch it. You can even put it in an index fund or another investment that will appreciate over time.\n\nDrivers need to think about investing more than ever, given how self-driving cars are expanding.\n\nI'm exploring the creation of an investment trust to own some of these cars — similar to a REIT that owns malls — that drivers can also invest in. I want them to have skin in the game and earn some passive income.\n\nI also put together a petition asking Uber and Lyft to pay their drivers a one-time \"Thank you\" bonus.\n\nBoth companies have made lots of money, especially over the last few years. Uber became profitable thanks to efforts such as upfront pricing, and Lyft has made a turnaround. Uber announced a $20 billion stock buyback program this year. Why can't we make drivers' lives better and create a sense of loyalty with a one-time payment like this?\n\nI've spoken to the CEOs of these companies because of my work for The Rideshare Guy, so I know they'll listen. Will they actually do it?\n\nOne thing I've learned in my time in the rideshare community is that the companies can do the right thing. In 2023, I worked with Pablo Gomez, another driver in Los Angeles, to get California's treasurer to update some of the reimbursement rates under Prop 22 — the state's pay law for gig workers — which led Uber to pay millions of dollars to drivers.\n\nIf Pablo hadn't mentioned that issue to me, I'd have had no clue about it, and we might have never gotten it fixed.\n\nI want to open the door for some different ideas about how we can benefit drivers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Collibra CEO Felix Van de Maele said it becomes \"a red flag\" if job seekers wanting to join his data governance platform cannot show familiarity with AI.\n\n\"In any interview, you expect people to think AI first in all the ways they do their job,\" Van de Maele said in an interview with Business Insider. \"And so if we ask for that and people haven't used or experimented with AI tools, they don't have a sense of how they do their job better, faster using AI, that definitely becomes a bit of a red flag.\"\n\nFounded in 2008 in Belgium, Collibra is among the top names in the data governance sector. In 2021, the private company was valued at $5.2 billion. Collibra has worked with McDonald's, Credit Suisse, Adobe, and Heineken.\n\nVan de Maele said the precise AI skills he's looking for vary by position. For example, he said, if he's interviewing an engineer, he wants to know if they are using AI agents like Cursor.\n\n\"I think you can ask questions to get a sense of how are people actually using those tools and what kind of experience have they had,\" he said. \"I think that's really important. Do they have an interest and are they leaning into wanting to use those tools, or are they more defensive and taking a step back on the adoption of those tools?\"\n\nVan de Maele said that at Collibra, which he described as sort of like \"ServiceNow for data,\" AI adoption has increased drastically over the past year. His roughly 1,000 employees around the world use AI for everything from transcribing meetings to building custom agents and assistants. The goal is to push AI usage to change how work is done.\n\nIn the enterprise marketplace, Van de Maele said he sees the ideal niche for his company as an independent layer that can connect a large amount of company-specific data, unlocking the true capabilities of AI, particularly the promise of AI agents.\n\n\"Imagine you're hiring a senior new person and in your organization and ask them to do certain analysis,\" he said.\n\nIt's challenging for humans to navigate all the hoops required to access what they need and understand how companies organize their data. In an agentic AI future, an agent could find themselves stuck in a similar situation.\n\n\"If a human can't do it, the agent can't do it unless you make that context formal and you capture that context so the agent can use that,\" Van de Maele said.\n\nMaking sure customers get a tailored experience is why Palantir helped popularize the use of forward-deployed engineers. OpenAI and other model makers are following suit with their own teams. The current issue with enterprise AI, Van de Maele said, is that if a company is tied to just a single model they could easily fall behind.\n\n\"If I'm a big bank, if I'm a big organization, I don't want to be completely tied to one model vendor because who knows, maybe next month there's another model that's five times better or five times cheaper,\" he said. \"I want to have the flexibility to change. That's strategically important to me.\"",

    "description": "Posters that appeared at Tesla's California factories and a review of LinkedIn profiles show how the automaker is scaling its ride-hailing service.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on its \"Robotaxi\" service — and putting factory workers and sales staff in drivers' seats to make it happen.\n\nThe electric-car maker has started recruiting workers off factory lines to operate its ride-hailing fleet. Tesla is offering production associates and material handlers extra hours and pay to take on the role of AI operator, according to posters that appeared at its California factories earlier this month.\n\nThe AI operators sit in the driver's seat, actively monitoring the vehicle while Tesla's Full Self-Driving software is engaged, and taking over when needed. Tesla plans to eventually release the software as a fully autonomous service.\n\nThe extra sets of hands will help the company expand ride-hailing availability in the Bay Area, the posters said.\n\nThe posters, which also appeared in several engineering facilities, noted that staffers could earn $500 if they refer a friend for the AI operator role.\n\nSome sales staffers in Nevada and Arizona moved over to similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix last month, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nAdding more operators could help Tesla speed up service. After Tesla rolled out its Robotaxi app to the public in September, wait times spiked, with some passengers reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes and a lack of available vehicles.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said he's recently seen wait times around 10 minutes in the Bay Area, and during peak commuting times, the app at times says it cannot provide a ride due to \"high service demand.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla completed the self-certification process for service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It has yet to apply for a license with the Nevada Transportation Authority to launch a commercial service, but it has a permit from the Arizona Department of Transportation that allows it to operate commercially in the state, spokespeople from the agencies told Business Insider.\n\nThe company has yet to begin offering paid rides in either state.\n\nMeanwhile, the company launched its Bay Area ride-hailing service in August. It's not registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California; it operates its service with a driver because the state has stricter regulations around autonomous vehicles than most other states, many of which operate around an honor system where the company self-certifies its vehicles.\n\nTesla has a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has said Tesla is not authorized to transport members of the public in an autonomous vehicle.\n\nTesla currently has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its ride-hailing service in California, according to a spokesperson for the CPUC. Tesla is required to update the agency incrementally as it adds new vehicles to the fleet, but not drivers, the spokesperson said. (The registration number reflects vehicles approved for use; it doesn't necessarily indicate how many are operating at any given time.)\n\nLast December, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would allow it to test its autonomous software with a test driver.\n\nA spokesperson for the DMV said Tesla has yet to apply for a driverless testing permit, which would be required before the company can offer AV rides to the public.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-hailing service in Austin, where it launched with a safety operator in the passenger seat.\n\nMusk said during an xAI event earlier this month that Tesla's Austin service will be driverless by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think it's pretty much a solved problem, we're going through validation right now,\" he said, according to a recording posted on social media.\n\nA spokesperson for the Austin Transportation Department told Business Insider that the company has yet to inform the city of the date it plans to roll out the driverless feature to its commercial service. Tesla is not legally required to inform the city, but it has typically alerted it to changes to its service, the spokesperson said.\n\nTesla is hiring for AI operators across the US, including in Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Texas, according to its website. The role has around-the-clock shifts and requires workers to sit behind the wheel while FSD is engaged, interact with passengers, and collect detailed reports on vehicle performance. It can also involve testing in various cities across the country. The salary ranges from around $25 to $30 per hour.\n\nThe recruiting process involved an FSD test drive, a valid driver's license, and passing a drug test and background check, according to people who interviewed for the role.\n\nMusk said in October that the company plans to expand its service to eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. The company is testing its service in several cities across the country.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at gkay@businessinsider.com or Signal at 248-894-6012.

    "fullText": "Tesla has scaled its California \"Robotaxi\" program at a lightning-fast pace.\n\nTo date, the automaker has registered 1,655 vehicles for its ride-hailing service in the state, a spokesperson from the California Public Utilities Commission told Business Insider. The company has registered 798 drivers, the spokesperson said.\n\nThat's up from 28 cars and 128 drivers in August, when the service launched, according to the CPUC.\n\nThe vehicle number reflects car that have been approved for use, not the actual operational fleet number. The spokesperson also said the carmaker isn't required to update the state as it adds new drivers, which means the current number could be higher.\n\nThe Alphabet-backed autonomous vehicle company began offering driverless rides for select members of the public in 2023.\n\nThe agency said Zoox has 229 registered vehicles. Zoox, which launched in San Francisco in November, told Business Insider that it has 50 vehicles active in its fleet between San Francisco and Las Vegas. Zoox and Waymo run fully autonomously.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles with the California Department of Motor Vehicles for a permit to test its self-driving software with a test driver.\n\nTesla's \"Robotaxi\" isn't registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California, which maintains some of the strictest AV regulations in the country. The company has not applied for a driverless testing permit, a DMV representative told Business Insider.\n\nThe company's permit from the CPUC allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public. A separate permit is required to transport passengers using an autonomous vehicle.\n\nSome users have complained on social media of long wait times since the company launched the Robotaxi app to the public in September. Tesla initially started operating the service with a small group of early access users; as access expanded, wait times have increased, with some users reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said that at times recently he's been unable to secure a ride due to a lack of inventory during peak commuting hours. On off hours, he's seen wait times around ten minutes, he said.\n\nTesla is ramping up driver staffing. The company has circulated flyers in its California factories offering hourly employees extra pay to help operate its network.\n\nIn Austin, where Elon Musk has said Tesla recently began testing its vehicles without drivers or safety operators, it's unclear how many cars the company has running in the service. Tesla is not required to submit these numbers to Austin, a spokesperson for the transportation department said.\n\nMusk said during an appearance in the \"All In\" podcast in October that Tesla planned to have around 500 vehicles running in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

Only the Galway champions qualify for the last four, with Loughrea pipping 2024 All-Ireland champions St Thomas' to claim their county title.\n\nIt's the third time Loughrea have reached this stage of the All-Ireland series. They lost the 2006 final to Ballyhale and suffered a one-point reverse to eventual winners Na Fianna of Dublin at this stage last season.\n\n\"We can't look beyond it [the semi-final], for the very simple reality is, we have never got over this stage before,\" McKaigue told BBC Sport NI.\n\n\"That's the big incentive, Loughrea come with tremendous pedigree, but our big thing now is to try and get into an All-Ireland final, and that's all we are focusing on because it's going to be a mammoth task.\"\n\nMcKaigue's return to small-ball action after a one-year hiatus has provided a huge boost for Paul McCormack's side after last year's agonising one-point extra-time defeat by Cork outfit Sarsfields.\n\nHis return also means that nine of the team that beat Loughgiel to become the first Derry club to win the Ulster title back in 2016, returned to lift their sixth title last month against St John's.\n\n\"I had little to offer last year in terms of body, but I've got my body into a state of mind now where I am not able to do the same things I used to do, but I can contribute in some way, and that is all you want to do,\" McKaigue admitted.\n\nLet's take a look back at Slaughtneil's five previous All-Ireland semi-finals encounters.",

    "fullText": "While many use our phones predominantly to doomscroll, smartphones have a range of little-known functions that could make life better and easier – from heart monitoring to even developing camera film\n\nOur smartphones are magical things – far more than dopamine drip providers and a way to keep in touch with friends and family. Using the built-in features and easily available additional apps, there are plenty of clever things you can do with your smartphone.\n\nThe iPhone’s Measure app uses augmented reality and the device’s camera to calculate everything from ceiling heights to room dimensions – handy for those DIY tasks that require a quick decision. And, good news for parents, Apple also points out that you can use it to measure a person’s height: the digital equivalent of etched markings on the wall.\n\nMetal detectors cost a pretty penny, but many modern devices have built-in magnetometers designed to help improve the accuracy of GPS within apps. Those magnetometers are also used in metal detectors, and some apps can harness that tech to detect metal. These apps are never going to be as accurate as tailor-made products, but if you are looking for a way to entertain the kids on a day at the beach, they will more than suffice in seeking out small bits of treasure.\n\nLost the television remote down the back of the sofa again? Many Android phones include an infrared blaster that can mimic the signals from your TV, set-top box or air-conditioning remote, while others can talk to smart devices over wifi or Bluetooth. Download a remote control app, point your phone at the screen, and you can adjust the volume, switch inputs or change channels. Link in smart lights, speakers and streaming sticks and your handset becomes a control centre for the whole living room … though it does make it easier for teenagers to prank you by changing channel mid-episode.\n\nGot a load of old photographic negatives that you never got round to having developed – or worse, lost the prints for? Apps such as FilmBox, available on iOS and Android, can turn your negatives into digital photos (provided you shine light through them). Even better, you can then use image-editing apps to fine-tune the colour balance on old, washed-out pics.\n\nSome companies now offer a callback service so you don’t have to stay on hold for ages, but if they don’t, you can use your phone to do the same thing. The Hold Assist feature, available on iPhones running iOS 26, gives you a notification when it hears a human voice on the other end of the line, so you can get back to work safe in the knowledge you won’t miss your turn.\n\nNewer iPhones and some Android handsets have depth sensors such as lidar (light detection and ranging) that can map the world in 3D. Install a scanning app, slowly walk around the object or room you want to capture, and your phone will stitch those readings into a detailed 3D model. You can then export it for 3D printing, game design or simply to keep a precise digital copy of bulky items before you sell or recycle them. It is also a neat way to document the contents of a rented flat for insurance purposes, or capture awkward corners when planning renovations.\n\nIf you are an outdoorsy type, phones can help keep you on key routes and out of danger. Make sure you download offline maps before you go somewhere remote, and your phone’s GPS will still work without reception. Hiking and cycling apps can track your route, elevation and distance, then save it so you can retrace your steps – or share it with friends later.\n\nCombined with smartwatches, smartphones have become a boon for those wanting to keep track of their health, but it’s possible to go even further. A 2022 trial to see whether a smartphone’s microphone could accurately measure heartbeats – similar to how a stethoscope works – demonstrated that “mobile technologies are a viable way of recording heart sounds”. A commercial “cardiac screening tool” app is already available in the US.\n\nSome people spend money on white noise machines and then cart them around in their suitcase when they are travelling. But it’s possible to achieve the same benefit with your iPhone. Simply go to the accessibility section in your device’s settings, then tap on audio & visual. You can then turn on a variety of sounds, from white noise to ocean waves to crackling fire, to lull you to sleep.\n\nTrying to repaint a wall without the original tin to hand can feel impossible. Instead of juggling paper swatches, use your phone’s camera and a colour-matching app to sample the shade directly from the wall, or cushion, or curtain, or whatever you like. The software will suggest the closest equivalents from major paint ranges, and some apps also let you preview those colours on a photo of your space, combining paint matching and augmented reality in one go.\n\nOn a foreign holiday and not sure what to eat or where to go? Live translation capabilities in apps such as Google Translate mean that it need not all be Greek to you. A combination of image recognition and live translation tools can identify foreign symbols and transpose English-language translations over the top of them, so you should never end up with an unexpected surprise for dinner.\n\nNot sure what is growing along your boundary wall, or what kind of cactus you have just bought? AI-powered insights from your smartphone’s camera lens can identify plants, animals and other objects, with surprising accuracy. Specialist apps abound for identifying plants, but the catch-all service provided by Google Lens is a surprisingly accurate way to distinguish your hydrangeas from your hosteas.\n\nBuilt-in cameras on all but the most expensive laptops and PCs are low-resolution and cope poorly in low-light conditions, meaning you’re blighted with the curse of blurry Zoom calls. Smartphone cameras are way more souped-up, and have automated processing that constantly tries to improve your image quality, making them ideal for replacing your webcam. On iPhones and Mac computers, you need to look for the Handoff feature. On Android devices and Windows, follow the instructions in the “Link to Windows” app to set it up.\n\nIf you have noisy neighbours or need to keep track of how much noise builders are subjecting you to, a slew of decibel-measuring apps are available. They are surprisingly accurate thanks to plenty of training, and some councils will even encourage complainants to download them and log intrusions if they are in dispute with neighbours.\n\nNear-field communication (NFC) is mostly associated with tap-to-pay transactions, but cheap NFC stickers (you can get 50 for less than £10 online) can act as programmable buttons for your life. Stick one by the front door and set your phone to turn on the wifi and lights when you tap it; put another on your bedside table to start a sleep playlist and enable Do Not Disturb. With a little experimentation, you can build simple smart home routines without buying a hub.\n\nIf you have ever hung a picture, stepped back and realised it is slightly wonky, your phone can spare you constant tinkering. Many handsets include a built-in spirit level tucked away in the compass or measurement tools. Lay your phone on the top edge of a frame or shelf and it will show when you have hit level, down to a fraction of a degree. It’s ideal, too, for levelling bookshelves, curtain poles and even sorting out a wonky table leg.\n\nBuying a house or getting a mortgage often involves having to sign contracts. Some companies will let you do this digitally, but if you are someone who prefers putting pen to paper, you can still do so – with the help of your device. Even most entry-level smartphones now include functions that allow you to turn a photograph into a perfectly serviceable scan by pinpointing the corners of a document when you hover your camera over it.\n\nFamily prints stashed in shoe boxes don’t have to remain static. Scan them into your phone and apps, including Google Photos and Apple Photos, and shots can automatically be grouped by people, places and dates, then stitched into short “memories” complete with music and transitions. Some tools even add subtle motion effects to still images, making them feel more like miniature films than dusty snapshots.\n\nHealth apps increasingly tap into sensors on your phone or connected watch to estimate blood oxygen saturation, a useful signal for issues such as breathing difficulties or altitude sickness. While they aren’t a replacement for clinical-grade monitors, they can function as an early warning system, highlighting unusual trends over time and prompting you to seek medical advice if something looks off, rather than ignoring a nagging feeling.\n\nDitch the dodgy clickers and install the companion app for PowerPoint, Keynote or Google Slides, and you can control your presentation remotely, swiping between slides and seeing your speaker notes on your handset. Some apps turn the screen into a virtual laser pointer, letting you highlight key details on a big display while roaming the stage, instead of being tethered to a laptop. At a pinch, you can even mirror your phone’s screen to a TV or projector and present straight from the handset if your main computer misbehaves.\n\nMost phones let you share your real-time location with trusted friends or family for a set length of time through apps such as WhatsApp. It is a low-effort safety net when walking home at night, travelling alone, or meeting someone new, and beats the old “text me when you get there” ritual.\n\nFor those who want to monitor what they are eating, phones make food diaries far less of a faff. Nutrition apps enable you to scan barcodes or search databases to log meals, automatically tallying calories and nutrients across the day. Many sync with your step counter or smartwatch, so you can see the balance between what is going in and what you are burning off, without being nose-deep in a spreadsheet. They are just as useful for people trying to eat more fibre, reduce salt or spot foods that trigger symptoms as they are for anyone counting calories.\n\nWith a cheap plug-in microphone and a basic editing app, your phone can record and trim surprisingly high-quality audio. It’s enough to start a podcast, capture interviews on the go or simply send better-than-voice-note updates to friends and family.\n\nWant to take a photo just by saying “click”? You can create voice-activated commands for your iPhone in the accessibility section – although it’s not super-straightforward. Tap on voice control > commands > custom, then select “create new command”. From there, you can type in a voice trigger (such as “click”), which then takes you into a recording of your screen. Everything you tap (like jabbing where the camera button is) will then be repeated whenever you say that phrase. So now when you open your camera and say “click”, hey presto! This can be useful, for automating all manner of repetitive tasks, although it only works when voice control is activated.\n\nPaper scribbles stuck to the fridge are no match for dedicated shopping list apps. Apps such as Bring!, AnyList or Listonic let you share a live list with housemates or partners, tick off items in real time as you walk the aisles, and even add products by scanning barcodes or importing ingredients directly from online recipes.",

    "fullText": "A staff exodus and a broken booking system are helping to cause huge jams in Britain’s driving test system\n\nIt has long been a stressful rite of passage for many young people but, in recent years, passing the actual driving test is the easy part. Now, many people seeking a test need to wake up early to snag a date before the bots do and, even then, they are looking at a long and arduous wait.\n\nDespite moves from the government to address the issue, an audit report released this week found plans to cut the wait for a driving test to seven weeks by the end of the year would not be achieved until November 2027.\n\nOne of the main barriers is an exodus of driving examiners. Only a net 83 more driving test examiners have been hired despite 19 recruitment campaigns since 2021, with the average wait for a practical test now at 22 weeks across Great Britain, according to the National Audit Office.\n\nSo, why is it so hard to recruit Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) driving examiners, and are instructors – who used to flock to test centres for a more stable career – tempted by the current offer?\n\nIn his previous job, kitted out with a bright hi-vis and Battenberg-marked car, Woodman was often mistaken for a police officer. “I was working as a traffic officer for Highways England. I was dealing with everything from hard-shoulder breakdowns to fatal incidents,” he said.\n\nAfter a friend suggested he become an DVSA examiner, Woodman took on the advice and joined a local test centre.\n\nHe said he wanted to bring a “positive attitude” to his new role. “I really enjoyed the job. I remember it took me two goes to pass my driving test. I remember my first one having this really miserable driving examiner and I thought: ‘This is pure torture’. Then my second driving examiner was fantastic. He came out with a smile on his face and I said: ‘That’s the way I want to be,’” said Woodman.\n\nBut the job did come with challenges. “You quite often get those times where you’ve stopped a crash from happening because you’ve taken control of a vehicle and then you’ve got to do another test within the next five minutes. That’s what people don’t realise about the job,” he said.\n\nOn the other hand, Woodman said it was “nice to make an impact on people’s lives every day” by telling them they had passed. “Some people break down in tears and other try to give you a hug.”\n\nDespite enjoying the job, Woodman left the DVSA in June 2023. “I moved on because of the money. I was growing a family and I was jealous of a few mates of mine who were hybrid working,” he said.\n\nAs government workers, DVSA driving examiners are paid on a civil service pay scale. They are designated executive officers, maxing out at just over £30,000.\n\n“Prices for lessons went up quite a bit after Covid and instructors were earning a lot more than they were previously,” said Woodman . He thinks that has “slimmed down” the DVSA’s pool of people.\n\nWhen Sykes first switched from being a freelance driving instructor to a DVSA examiner in 2016, he was happy. “At the time, I was taking home a similar amount of money without having to put in nearly as many hours. I was getting holiday pay, sick pay and a reasonable pension. I got my weekends back and I finished at the same time every night. I loved the job,” he said.\n\nBut, after Covid, things changed. He was vocal to senior DVSA figures about the issues he was experiencing with the job, including, he said, the recently departed chief executive, Loveday Rider.\n\nHe said he had met her on four occasions and brought up examiner’s poor wages and the “dodgy” booking system which allows bots and less reputable instructors to buy up tests and sell them at a hugely inflated price. “It’s not fair on the learner,” he said.\n\nSykes switched back to being a driving instructor but he still has fond memories of being an examiner. “I had one lady, her name was Jean. She was 82 years old. She had been here five times and she was desperate to pass.\n\n“She’d started to learn to drive when she was about 20 and then she met her husband. After this, she had no reason to need to drive any more because her husband drove,” said Sykes.\n\nAfter her husband died, she still wanted to get around so she started learning to drive again. “She passed her test when she was 82. It was amazing and lovely giving somebody that age a pass certificate,” said Sykes.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some close calls, including one instance that left him “drip white”. He recalls one young woman who wanted to do her test in her own car, which she had hardly driven, because “that’s the car that she’s going to be driving when she passes”, he said.\n\n“The instructor was sat in the back. As we emerged out at the end of a road, the candidate on test had missed the fact that there was a car transporter with about 12 cars on it hurtling up the road at 30 miles an hour towards us,” said Sykes.\n\n“She tries to pull out but she fumbles at the controls. She reached for a manual handbrake in the car but there wasn’t one, only an electric one she was unfamiliar with. I said: ‘Drive, drive, drive.’ I went drip white, so did the instructor. We just pulled up to the side of the road and I went: ‘I think we’ve seen enough.’”\n\nRamwell, who runs the YouTube channel Josh the Driving Instructor, has been an instructor since 2019. Before this, he was a teacher. Does being a DVSA driving examiner tempt him? “If I’m completely honest, no,” he said.\n\nWhile Ramwell takes his “hat off to examiners” who have his “complete and full respect”, he thinks it can be quite a thankless job. He said: “When you pass someone, they generally thank the instructor. And if you end up failing someone, examiners end up being blamed for it.”\n\nHe was a relative late bloomer to driving, getting his licence at 22. He said the most rewarding part of being an instructor was when students get a “lightbulb moment”, whether struggling with a clutch or taking on a daunting roundabout.\n\n“You can see it in their eyes, the cogs working, and next thing you know, they’re absolutely perfect at roundabouts,” he said.\n\nRamwell has had many success stories but, like most instructors, some near-misses as well.\n\n“I had this really lovely girl but she suffered a lot from anxiety. We were driving down the road and unfortunately, there was another driver behind us who might have been late for work or something because she was tailgating us a bit closer than you would like.\n\n“I told the girl: ‘Don’t look behind you. Just focus ahead, the roundabout’s coming up. In a minute you’re gonna have to press the brake.’\n\n“The second I said the word ’brake’, in the middle of the road at 30 miles an hour, she just full-on emergency stopped and I had enough time to shout ‘Noo’ before the person behind hit straight into the back of us. That was a very sad day.”",

    "fullText": "Steps to help combat fraud in which criminals use AI-generated replica of a person’s voice to deceive victims\n\nThe voicemail from your son is alarming. He has just been in a car accident and is highly stressed. He needs money urgently, although it is not clear why, and he gives you some bank details for a transfer.\n\nYou consider yourself wise to other scams, and have ignored texts claiming to be from him and asking for cash. But you can hear his voice and he is clearly in trouble.\n\nHowever, the voicemail is the latest way in which criminals are using technology to defraud people. By taking a tiny snippet of real audio – just three seconds is enough – from a person, they can “clone” the individual’s voice using freely available AI technology. From there, they can make an recording of the synthesised voice saying exactly what they want.\n\nThe criminals can record a voice from videos on social media or by calling someone and saying nothing. A victim just needs to respond with words such as “hello, who is there?” to give them material for their hoax.\n\nOliver Devane, a senior researcher at the online security company McAfee, says this is a sophisticated example of spear phishing, or a personalised, targeted attack.\n\n“Having tested some of the free and paid AI voice cloning tools online, we found in one instance, that just three seconds of audio was needed to produce a good match,” he says.\n\n“Cybercriminals will often source this information from public social media profiles and other places online where people post about themselves, their families, their travels, and so on in an attempt to cash in.\n\n“The cybercriminal is betting on a loved one or family member becoming worried, letting emotions take over, and sending money to help.”\n\nA phone call or a voicemail, or even a voice note, will come through on your mobile and sound exactly like a loved one or friend.\n\nThey will have been involved in an accident or they may have been robbed or injured. They will be distressed and there will be a sense of urgency.\n\nWhatever the circumstances, they will ask for money. They may not give details of why they need the money but they will say it is urgent. They may ask you to transfer it to an account that belongs to someone else.\n\nAs with many scams, if you get a call or voicemail that asks for money, take a moment to stop and think. Does it really sound like the person you know? Are there strange speech patterns that are not accounted for by the fact that there is an emergency.\n\nEven if the phone number comes up as coming from one of your children, this is no assurance as the number can also be faked.\n\n“Try to remain level-headed and pause before you take any next steps,” says Devane. “Remember that cybercriminals are betting on emotions running high. They will play on your connection to the loved one and create a sense of urgency to prompt you into action.”\n\nCall the person who it seems left the message. They may pick up and be able to reassure you that they are OK. Remember the message has come by phone, so even if there is a real emergency they clearly can reach their device and get a signal.\n\nTo prepare for the possibility of such scams, you can set up a codeword between you and your children so you know for sure when they are in trouble.",

    "fullText": "Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2025. Donate today\n\nGothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul has vetoed a bill that would have required two-person crews on every New York City subway train, including a conductor and a driver.\n\nHochul’s veto is a blow to the Transit Workers Union, which had championed the bill for decades, arguing that having two-person train crews is crucial for safety.\n\nIn her veto, Hochul wrote that trains can be operated safely by one driver, and cited the bill’s cost.\n\n“The bill would cost as much as $10 million annually, reducing service, and limiting the MTA’s ability to benefit from capital investments in modern rolling stock and signals,” she wrote.\n\nThe MTA’s contract with the Transit Workers Union already requires two-person crews on many trains, and the legislation, on its own, wouldn’t have changed that. But it would have required an additional worker on the trains that currently only have one operator, as well as on future lines. State lawmakers overwhelmingly passed the bill in June.\n\nThe union did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the veto. But in September, TWU President John Samuelsen told Gothamist that having two workers per train is not just “a necessity for safety” but also “wanted by the overwhelming majority of New York City working people.” On Thursday, Hochul announced that subway crime was at its lowest level in 16 years, with overall major crime on the transit system down 5.2% from last year and 14.4% from 2019.\n\nAfter the veto, Samuelsen told the New York Times that Hochul’s decision to veto the bill was “classist,” and suggested that Hochul might experience a backlash from transit workers during her re-election campaign next year.\n\nBudget watchdogs, however, praised Hochul’s move.\n\n“The governor did the exact right thing vetoing this bill,” said Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission.\n\nHe said having one worker per train is “the global norm used by virtually every other transit system around the world,” and provides equally good service while saving money. In a study of 400 subway and commuter rail lines in 36 cities, NYU's Marron Institute of Urban Management found that fewer than 6.25% used two-person crews.\n\n17 people suffered non-severe injuries in what NJ Transit called a \"minor derailment\"\n\nCritics of the \"100-foot\" rule said it was a giveaway to developers on the backs of utility customers.\n\nCritics of the \"100-foot\" rule said it was a giveaway to developers on the backs of utility customers.",

    "description": "The leading approach to the simplex method, a widely used technique for balancing complex logistical constraints, can’t get any better.",
    "fullText": "of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nIn 1939, upon arriving late to his statistics course at UC Berkeley, George Dantzig—a first-year graduate student—copied two problems off the blackboard, thinking they were a homework assignment. He found the homework “harder to do than usual,” he would later recount, and apologized to the professor for taking some extra days to complete it. A few weeks later, his professor told him that he had solved two famous open problems in statistics. Dantzig’s work would provide the basis for his doctoral dissertation and, decades later, inspiration for the film Good Will Hunting.\n\nDantzig received his doctorate in 1946, just after World War II, and he soon became a mathematical adviser to the newly formed US Air Force. As with all modern wars, World War II’s outcome depended on the prudent allocation of limited resources. But unlike previous wars, this conflict was truly global in scale, and it was won in large part through sheer industrial might. The US could simply produce more tanks, aircraft carriers, and bombers than its enemies. Knowing this, the military was intensely interested in optimization problems—that is, how to strategically allocate limited resources in situations that could involve hundreds or thousands of variables.\n\nThe Air Force tasked Dantzig with figuring out new ways to solve optimization problems such as these. In response, he invented the simplex method, an algorithm that drew on some of the mathematical techniques he had developed while solving his blackboard problems almost a decade before.\n\nNearly 80 years later, the simplex method is still among the most widely used tools when a logistical or supply-chain decision needs to be made under complex constraints. It’s efficient and it works. “It has always run fast, and nobody’s seen it not be fast,” said Sophie Huiberts of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).\n\nAt the same time, there’s a curious property that has long cast a shadow over Dantzig’s method. In 1972, mathematicians proved that the time it takes to complete a task could rise exponentially with the number of constraints. So, no matter how fast the method may be in practice, theoretical analyses have consistently offered worst-case scenarios that imply it could take exponentially longer. For the simplex method, “our traditional tools for studying algorithms don’t work,” Huiberts said.\n\nBut in a new paper that will be presented in December at the Foundations of Computer Science conference, Huiberts and Eleon Bach, a doctoral student at the Technical University of Munich, appear to have overcome this issue. They’ve made the algorithm faster, and also provided theoretical reasons why the exponential runtimes that have long been feared do not materialize in practice. The work, which builds on a landmark result from 2001 by Daniel Spielman and Shang-Hua Teng, is “brilliant [and] beautiful,” according to Teng.\n\n“It’s very impressive technical work, which masterfully combines many of the ideas developed in previous lines of research, [while adding] some genuinely nice new technical ideas,” said László Végh, a mathematician at the University of Bonn who was not involved in this effort.\n\nThe simplex method was designed to address a class of problems like this: Suppose a furniture company makes armoires, beds, and chairs. Coincidentally, each armoire is three times as profitable as each chair, while each bed is twice as profitable. If we wanted to write this as an expression, using a, b, and c to represent the amount of furniture produced, we would say that the total profit is proportional to 3a + 2b + c.\n\nTo maximize profits, how many of each item should the company make? The answer depends on the constraints it faces. Let’s say that the company can turn out, at most, 50 items per month, so a + b + c is less than or equal to 50. Armoires are harder to make—no more than 20 can be produced—so a is less than or equal to 20. Chairs require special wood, and it’s in limited supply, so c must be less than 24.\n\nThe simplex method turns situations like this—though often involving many more variables—into a geometry problem. Imagine graphing our constraints for a, b and c in three dimensions. If a is less than or equal to 20, we can imagine a plane on a three-dimensional graph that is perpendicular to the a axis, cutting through it at a = 20. We would stipulate that our solution must lie somewhere on or below that plane. Likewise, we can create boundaries associated with the other constraints. Combined, these boundaries can divide space into a complex three-dimensional shape called a polyhedron.",

    "description": "With the recent addition of SharedArrayBuffer, concurrency is finding its way into the JavaScript language.",
    "fullText": "With the recent addition of SharedArrayBuffer, concurrency is finding its way into the JavaScript language. This addition allows JavaScript programs to perform concurrent access to SharedArrayBuffer objects. WebKit supports SharedArrayBuffer and it has full optimization support in our compiler pipeline. Unfortunately, JavaScript does not allow any objects other than SharedArrayBuffer to be shared.\n\nThis post considers a wild thought experiment: what would it take to extend concurrency to the entire JavaScript heap? In this world, any object can be shared with other threads. This would be no small change. Existing JavaScript VM optimizations exploit the fact that there is only one thread of execution, so concurrency is sure to introduce some performance problems. This post is concerned with whether this is even technically feasible, and if it is, what the cost might be.\n\nWe offer a basic strawman API to illustrate what we mean by concurrency. Most of the post is concerned with how WebKit’s JavaScript VM (called JavaScriptCore, or JSC for short) can implement the strawman. Implementing this strawman will be a big effort. We think that our proposed implementation ought to be able to meet the following goals:\n\nOur proposed implementation scheme relies on 64-bit systems, but that is largely because our engine is already 64-bit-centric.\n\nIt’s not yet possible to evaluate the performance of this scheme empirically, but our implementation sketch does make it possible to intuit what performance might look like. Specifically, our scheme ensures that most property accesses will experience at most one arithmetic instruction worth of overhead (which is almost free), with a few particularly tricky (and rare) ones experiencing up to about 7x overhead. This post ends with a section that compares our scheme to other techniques for implementing concurrency.\n\nOur strawman proposal for concurrent JS is to simply add threads. Threads gets separate stacks but share everything else. Threads are great for our experiment because they are so general. We can imagine implementing many other kinds of concurrent programming models on top of threads. Thus, if we can get our VM to support threads, then we can probably get it to support lots of other concurrent and parallel programming models. This post is about removing technical feasibility as a gating factor for adding any concurrent programming model to JavaScript.\n\nThis section makes the strawman somewhat concrete, mostly to provide context on the aspects of it that are easy or hard to implement. It’s useful to know what the API looks like in order to understand what constraints it creates.\n\nEach program will start out with one thread. Threads can start other threads. Threads live in the same heap and can share objects with each other. This section shows the API, describes the memory model, and shows how concurrency interacts with the DOM.\n\nThis post will use this strawman to understand exactly what it would take to implement threads in JavaScriptCore.\n\nWe want it to be easy to create threads:\n\nThis will start a new thread, which will eventually print “Hello, threads!”. Note that even this simple example shares lots of stuff with the thread. For example, the function object captures the lexical scope in the thread in which it was created, so that when the thread accesses the console variable, this is an access to a shared object.\n\nThreads can be joined to wait for them to finish and to get their result:\n\nIn web browsers, the main thread cannot block, so join() will throw an exception if the above code was on the main thread. We can support asynchronous versions of blocking operations:\n\nYou can always get the Thread object for the current thread:\n\nThreads may need to wait on each other to prevent races. This can be accomplished using locks. Rather than simply introduce a locking API, we propose to extend the Atomics API to allow users to build any locks they like. We provide a good lock implementation in our proposed API, but we want to encourage the creation of other kinds of synchronization primitives. The existing SharedArrayBuffer specification allows developers to create custom locks using the Atomics API. This API allows you to say things like:\n\nCurrently, the array must be an integer typed array backed by a SharedArrayBuffer. We propose extending all Atomics methods that take an array/index to take an object and a property name instead. Since an index is a property name, this does not change behavior of code that already uses this API for SharedArrayBuffer. This also implies that Atomics methods that currently take integer values (for storing or comparing to elements in typed arrays) will now be able to take any JavaScript value when used with normal JavaScript properties. Atomics.wake, Atomics.wait, and Atomics.compareExchange are sufficient for implementing any a lock using just one JavaScript property.\n\nAdditionally, we propose adding a Lock API:\n\nLocking on the main thread is possible with promises:\n\nThis works because each thread gets its own runloop. We can also add a Condition API:\n\nCondition.prototype.wait will release the lock you pass it before waiting, and reacquire it before returning. The async variant associates the resulting promise with the condition variable such that if the condition is notified, the promise will be fulfilled on the current thread.\n\nUsing Thread.current and WeakMap, anyone can implement thread-local variables. Nonetheless, it’s sometimes possible for the underlying runtime to do something more clever. We don’t want to require all JavaScript programmers to know how to implement thread-local variables with WeakMap. Hence, we propose a simple API:\n\nFinally, we want to make it easy for users to assert that objects stay on one thread:\n\nAny object that is Thread.restricted should throw ConcurrencyAccessError in response to any proxyable operation performed by a thread other than the one that called Thread.restrict.\n\nProcessors and compilers like to reorder memory accesses. Both processors and compilers love to hoist loads from memory. This happens because the following code:\n\nMay get transformed by the compiler or processor to:\n\nEffectively, this means that the “load” into y got moved above the store to o.g. Processors will do the same optimization dynamically, by caching the load of o.f and reusing the cached result for the second load.\n\nProcessors and compilers like to sink stores to memory. This happens because the following code:\n\nMay get transformed by the compiler or processor to:\n\nThis is “as if” the o.f = 42 statement got moved to just before o.f = 43. Even if the compiler does not perform this transformation, the processor may buffer stores and execute them when it is convenient. This can also mean that o.f = 42 may execute after let tmp = o.g.\n\nIt makes most sense for our strawman to follow the existing SharedArrayBuffer memory model. It’s already possible to write multithreaded code that has boundedly nondeterministic behavior using SharedArrayBuffer, and we aren’t going to protect completely from such code. But JavaScript’s objects are much more complicated than a buffer, so guaranteeing that basic invariants of the JS object model hold in the face of races is nontrivial. We propose that operations that modify JavaScript object storage execute atomically. Atomicity means that if many threads execute these operations concurrently, then each one will behave as if they had all executed in some sequence with no concurrency. Each of the underlying operations that JS can do to objects should be atomic:\n\nThis doesn’t always mean that the expression o.f is atomic, since this expression may do much more than loading a property’s value. In particular:\n\nWe propose that the low-level object operations are atomic. Some operations, like getting and setting a property’s value, may be implemented using hardware primitives that allow reordering. We propose to allow reorderings of get/set accesses around each other subject to the same memory model for get/set accesses to SharedArrayBuffer. While our strawman does allow for races and some memory model strangeness, it does not allow for JavaScript’s object model invariants to be invalidated. For any heap created by a concurrent JS program, it should be possible to write a sequential JS program that creates an indistinguishable heap.\n\nFinally, we propose that memory management of the concurrent JS heap happens just as it does in other garbage-collected multi-threaded languages. Quite simply, garbage collection must appear to happen atomically and only at well defined safepoints, like loop back edges, allocation sites, and during calls to native code that doesn’t touch the heap. This requirement is satisfied by popular garbage collection algorithms like those in HotSpot or MMTk. It’s also satisfied by classic algorithms like mark-sweep and semi-space, and even in garbage collectors with no global stop-the-world phase, including ones that are so lock-free that they don’t even stop threads to scan their stacks. WebKit’s Riptide GC already mostly supports multiple threads because our JIT threads can access the heap.\n\nExtending concurrency to all of JavaScript will be hard; extending it to all of the DOM will be even harder. We extend enough reasoning about threads to the DOM to make this strawman useful.\n\nWe propose that by default, DOM objects throw ConcurrentAccessError in response to any proxyable operation from threads other than the main one, just as if Thread.restrict had been called on them from the main thread.\n\nHowever, a few objects will have to allow for concurrent accesses just to make the language behave sanely. Something obvious like:\n\nrequires a concurrent access to a DOM object. In WebKit, DOM global objects are in charge of storing the variable state of a window. Ordinary JS properties of the global object (including console, Object, etc) have to be accessible to concurrent threads, because those properties are the scripts’s global variables. Accesses from other threads to exotic properties of the global object, or properties of the global object’s prototype, can throw. Attempts to add new properties to the global object or delete properties from it from non-main threads can throw as well. These restrictions mean that in WebKit, handling the DOM global object’s limited kind of concurrent property accesses is not much harder than handling those same accesses for ordinary JS objects.\n\nAdditionally, namespace objects like console can be accessed by concurrent threads because they can just use the JS object model. There is no reason to restrict them to the main thread, and it’s important that console is accessible due to its utility for debugging.\n\nThis section has proposed a strawman API for threading in JavaScript. This API is powerful enough to implement custom synchronization primitives. It’s also powerful enough to allow for the execution of racy programs, but it does not allow races to break the language. Threads are general enough to allow for many other kinds of programming models to be implemented on top of them.\n\nThis section shows that we can implement our threads-based strawman without having to disable any of JavaScriptCore’s fundamental performance optimizations. Our scheme aims to achieve close to zero overhead even in the case of programs that read and write to the same objects from multiple threads.\n\nJavaScript shares a lot in common with languages like Java and .NET, which already support threads. Here are some of the things these languages have in common with JavaScript:\n\nThese similarities suggest that many of the techniques that are already used to make Java virtual machines support concurrency can be reused to make JavaScript concurrent.\n\nWhere things get hard is JavaScript’s ability to dynamically reconfigure objects. While Java and .NET have fixed-size objects (once allocated, an object does not change size), JavaScript objects tend to be variable-size. Concurrency in those statically-typed languages relies on the fact that concurrent accesses to fixed-size objects are atomic by default up to the machine’s pointer width (so, 64-bit systems do 64-bit property accesses atomically by default). Pointer values in Java and .NET are addresses to the contiguous slab of memory holding the object’s data, and it only takes some address arithmetic (like adding an offset) and a single memory access instruction to read/write any field. Even if the memory model allows surprising reorderings, it’s never the case that a racing access instruction to the same field (or different fields of the same object) corrupts the entire object or causes a crash. JavaScript’s variable-size objects, on the other hand, mean that object accesses require multiple memory access instructions in some cases. A sequence of operations involving multiple accesses to memory is not atomic by default. In the worst case, the VM might crash because the internal object state gets corrupted. Even if this doesn’t happen, races might cause writes to be lost or for time-travel to occur (writing A and then B to a field may lead to reads of that field to first see A, then B, and then A again).\n\nIn our strawman proposal, concurrent JavaScript implies that fundamental operations such as adding a new property to an object, changing the value of a property, reading a property, and removing a property all proceed atomically. No race should ever lead to a VM crash, lost writes, or the value of a property experiencing time travel.\n\nWe propose an algorithm that allows most JavaScript object accesses to be wait-free and require minimal overhead compared to our existing serial JS implementation. Wait-free operations execute without ever blocking and complete in a bounded number of steps regardless of contention. This algorithm borrows ideas from real-time garbage collection, locking algorithms, and type inference. We plan to use a tiered defense against the overheads of concurrency:\n\nBefore diving into the details, we first set up some expectations for the hardware that this proposed system would run on. Then we describe this proposal in reverse. We consider the cost of just using per-object locking. Then we review the existing JSC object model and describe what kinds of operations happen to already be atomic within this model. Next we introduce segmented butterflies, which are the key to allow dynamically reconfiguring objects. Then we show how our TTL inference will allow us to use our existing object model for hopefully most of the JavaScript heap. This section then considers some loose ends, like how to do inline caching concurrently, how resizable arrays fit into TTL and segmented butterflies, how to handle large thread counts using the local optimizer lock (LOL), and finally how to handle native state that isn’t thread-safe.\n\nThis post describes how to convert JavaScriptCore to support concurrent JavaScript. JSC is currently optimized for 64-bit systems, and most of our existing concurrency support (concurrent JIT, concurrent GC) only works on 64-bit systems. This section briefly summarizes what we expect from a 64-bit system to be able to use our scheme.\n\nJSC is optimized for x86-64 and ARM64. This scheme assumes the weaker of the two memory models (ARM64) and assumes that the following atomic instructions are inexpensive enough that it’s practical to use them as an optimization over locking:\n\nEach object in JSC already has a lock, which we use to synchronize certain fundamental JavaScript operations with the garbage collector. We can use this lock to protect any operations that need to be synchronized between JavaScript threads. The rest of this post deals with optimizations that allow us to avoid this lock. But let’s consider exactly what the cost of the lock is. Our internal object lock algorithm requires an atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) and a branch for locking, and another CAS and branch for unlocking. In the best case, CAS is like executing at least 10 cycles. This is the amortized cost assuming the CAS succeeds. On some hardware, the cost is much higher. Assuming a branch is one cycle, this means at least 22 extra cycles for each object operation that requires the lock. Some rare operations are already expensive enough that 22 cycles is not bad, but many fast path operations would not be able to handle such overhead. Below we consider some operations and how much they would be affected if they had to use locking.\n\nWhile some operations like deletion are already expensive enough that locking is not a problem, we don’t believe it’s practical to add such extreme costs to the fast cases of JavaScript object access. The resulting programming language would be too slow.\n\nDesigning a fast concurrent JS implementation requires introducing new algorithms for property accesses that can run concurrently to each other without requiring any locking except in rare cases. In the sections that follow, we describe such an algorithm. First we review JavaScriptCore’s object model. Then we show cases where JavaScriptCore’s object model already behaves as if it had fixed-size objects; those cases never require locking. Next we show a technique called segmented butterflies, which allows for mostly wait-free concurrent object access. By itself, this technique is still too expensive for our tastes. So, we show how to infer which object types are transition-thread-local (TTL) to avoid synchronization when transitioning objects. This allows us to use flat butterflies (our existing object model) for the majority of objects. Then we describe how to handle deletion, dictionary lookups, inline caches, arrays, and thread-unsafe objects.\n\nJavaScriptCore’s object model allows for four kinds of state, each of which is optional:\n\nThe first two kinds of state does not involve resizing the object. The last two kinds of state require resizing. In JSC, fixed-sized state is stored directly in the object’s cell. The cell is what a pointer to an object points to. Within the cell, there is a butterfly pointer that can be used to store dynamically-allocated and resizable state in a butterfly. Butterflies store named properties to the left of where the butterfly pointer points inside out-of-line slots, and indexed properties to the right as array elements. Each of those locations may store a tagged JavaScript value, which may be a number, pointer to another cell (representing a string, symbol, or object), or a special value (true, false, null, or undefined).\n\nEvery object has a structure, which contains the hashtable used for mapping property names to slots in the object. Objects typically share a structure with other objects that look like it (that have the same properties in the same order, among other requirements). The structure is referenced using a 32-bit index into a structure table. We do this to save space. The indexing and cell state bytes have some spare bits. We used two spare bits in the indexing byte to support per-object locking. We also have spare bits in the butterfly pointer, since pointers don’t need all 64 bits on a 64-bit system.\n\nButterflies are optional. Many objects don’t have a butterfly. When a butterfly is allocated, each of the two sides are optional. The left side of the butterfly holds the out-of-line slots. It’s possible just to allocate that; in this case the butterfly pointer will point 8 bytes to the right of the end of the butterfly’s memory. The right side of the butterfly holds the array elements and the array header. The public length is the length as it is reported by array.length, while the vector length is the number of array element slots that were allocated.\n\nWithin this object model, accesses to anything in the cell itself are atomic by default, just like accesses to objects in Java are atomic by default. This is a big deal, since our optimizer is generally successful at putting the most important object fields inline in the cell. Concurrent JS programs that mostly rely on data that ends up inside the cell will experience almost no overhead versus their serial equivalents.\n\nAdditionally, if we know that the butterfly won’t be reallocated ever again (i.e. the butterfly pointer is immutable), then we can access it directly without any problems. Those accesses will be atomic by default.\n\nAlternatively, if we know that only the current thread will ever resize the butterfly and all other threads will only read it, then accesses to the butterfly will be atomic by default.\n\nProblems happen when one thread attempts to transition the object (i.e. add a property and/or reconfigure the butterfly) while some other thread is writing to it (or also transitioning it). If we used our current implementation of object accesses in a concurrent setting, a transition on one thread could cause races that lead to behavior that does not conform to our proposed specification.\n\nIn the next section we show how to create an object model that has no such races, but comes with some cost. After that, we show how to use TTL inference to use our existing object model most of the time even in programs that share objects between threads.\n\nTransitioning an object means allocating a new butterfly, and copying the contents of the old butterfly into the new one while other threads may be reading or writing the old butterfly. We want the copy to seem as if it had happened in one atomic step. Lots of research has gone into supporting concurrent copying of objects in the context of real-time garbage collectors. The approach that we propose to use is based on the Schism real-time garbage collector‘s arraylet object model. This section reviews the Schism arraylet object model and then shows how it can be used for butterfly transitions.\n\nSchism was trying to solve the problem of implementing a copying garbage collector whose copying phase was completely concurrent to the application. It was based on the observation that copying an object concurrently to other threads accessing the object is easy if the object is immutable. It’s only hard if the object can be written to by the other threads. Schism solves the problem of copying mutable objects concurrently by boxing the mutable state in small fixed-size fragments (32 bytes in the paper). The object that gets copied is the spine that serves as an index for finding fragments. All object accesses use an extra indirection to find the fragment that contains the data being accessed. Spines are immutable objects because the fragments they point to never move.\n\nWebKit already uses something like arraylets as well, in the WTF::SegmentedVector class template. We use it to prevent having to move C++ objects when the vector resizes. We also use it for implementing the JSGlobalObject‘s variable storage (for var statements in global scope). The term arraylets is due to Bacon, Cheng, and Rajan, who used them to control fragmentation in the Metronome garbage collector. Lots of arraylet research shows that the extra indirection has a high cost (often 10% or more). That is, if you double the cost of each array access by adding an extra indirection, then you will increase the total run time of the program by 10%.\n\nWe can use this trick for butterflies. A segmented butterfly has a spine that contains pointers to fragments that contain mutable data. If we need to add new properties and those properties won’t fit in an existing fragment, we can grow the spine and allocate more fragments. Growing the spine implies reallocating it. We can safely allocate a new spine and memcpy the contents of the old one into it, since the spine’s contents never changes. In this world, no writes ever get lost or experience time travel when a butterfly is being transitioned. An access that races with the transition either gets to a fragment using the old spine, or the new spine; since both spines will contain the same fragment addresses for properties that existed before the transition, every possible interleaving results in threads reading and writing the same fragments.\n\nThe most natural way to implement segmented butterflies is probably to have 32-byte fragments like in Schism, since this is also a sweet-spot for our GC. The vector length is be inside the butterfly spine, since this is an immutable property of that spine. The vector length allows the spine to self-identify how big its right side is. The public length is mutable, so we want to put it into one of the fragments. Note that the first fragment also contains the old vector length. This property is unused when we are using segmented butterflies. It allows us to convert a flat butterfly into a segmented butterfly by having the spine point at slices of the flat butterfly; we discuss this optimization more in a later section.\n\nThis still leaves the problem of concurrent transitions. Transitions have to reallocate the spine, change some data in the type header, and store a property’s value. Reallocating the spine is optional since usually some fragment will already have a spare slot. Changing the type is optional, for example in case of array resizing. The type header and butterfly can be set atomically using a DCAS (double-world compare-and-swap; 64-bit systems typically support 128-bit CAS). But this isn’t enough, since no matter if we set the property’s value before or after the DCAS, we will have a race. The property’s slot can be anywhere in memory, so there’s no way to use CAS to simultaneously do the whole transition.\n\nIf we set the newly-added value slot before changing everything else, we risk a race in which one thread tries to use some object slot for adding field f while another thread tries to use the same slot for field g. If we’re not careful, the second thread might win the race for the type (so everyone thinks we added property g) while the first thread wins the race for the property (so we get thread 1’s intended value for property f appearing as if it was stored by thread 2 into g).\n\nIf we set the newly-added value slot after changing everything else, then all loads have to contend with the possibility that slots can have “holes”. In other words, at any time, an object may claim a type that includes a property f even though the object does not have a value for f yet. We could change the language to allow this: putting a new property into an object would first involve defining it to undefined and then storing the real value.\n\nWe choose to put a lock around transitions. This lock isn’t for guarding races between transitions and other accesses, since those are atomic by default thanks to segmented butterflies — it’s for protecting transitions from each other. To ensure that objects don’t have holes, transitions store the new property’s value before changing the type. Transitions can use this algorithm:\n\nThis results in the following cost model:\n\nRecall that the arraylet research shows 10% or higher costs if arrays use a segmented object model. We’re proposing to use it for ordinary properties as well, if those properties were added in a sufficiently subtle way that we weren’t able to inline them into the cell. It’s probably safe to assume that if we implemented literally this, we incur at least a 10% slow-down. We would like to have close to zero overhead. The next section shows how we think we can get there.\n\nSegmented butterflies are only necessary when:\n\nWe can use flat butterflies — our existing object model — when we know that these things haven’t happened yet. This section describes a hybrid object model that uses either flat or segmented butterflies, depending on whether or not we have detected a possible write-transition race. This object model also allows us to avoid locking while doing many transitions.\n\nOn a 64-bit system, butterfly pointers have 48 bits of pointer information and have zeroes in their high 16 bits. 16 bits is enough to store:\n\nSome systems have more than 48 pointer bits. In a later section, we show how to make this scheme useful even if we had to use fewer bits. Also, we could restrict butterfly allocations to the lower 248 addresses if we really wanted 16 spare bits.\n\nLet’s say that these bits are encoded as follows:\n\nWe can use flat butterflies — our existing object model — whenever the TID matches the current thread. We set the SW bit and use a magic TID value (all bits set) to indicate that the butterfly is segmented. This section shows how to use these bits to allow the use of flat butterflies anytime we know that no transition race can occur. We call this transition thread locality inference.\n\nAnytime a thread attempts to write to a butterfly and the TID matches the current thread, it can simply write to the butterfly without doing anything special.\n\nAnytime a thread attempts to write to a butterfly, the TID does not match, but the SW bit is set, it can simply write to the butterfly as well.\n\nAnytime a thread attempts to read a butterfly, it just needs to check that the TID to determine if the read should be segmented (extra indirection) or not.\n\nAnytime a read or write encounters TID = notTTLTID and SW = true, it knows to use the segmented object model.\n\nThe following cases need special handling:\n\nThe sections that follow show further refinements that reduce overhead even more. First we consider how to avoid checking TID and SW bits on every operation. Next we show how to use structure watchpointing to avoid locking on the most common transitions. Then we show how to handle array resizing. Finally we explain in more detail how flat butterflies can be transitioned to segmented ones.\n\nThis section will show how to make concurrent JS as fast as serial JS in many of the most important cases by simply extending optimizations that JavaScriptCore already uses.\n\nJSC optimizes the code for heap accesses using inline caching. We use inline caches for accesses to named properties (like o.f) and for array accesses (like a[i]).\n\nObjects that have the same properties at the same offsets will usually share the same structure, which is identified by 32 bits in the object’s type header. If a property access tends to see the same structure, then we will generate new machine code for this property access, which checks that the object has the expected structure and then accesses the property directly. Failed speculation causes recompilation of the inline cache. If the inline cache remains stable (doesn’t recompile much) for a long time and the function that contains it becomes eligible for optimized JIT compilation, then the optimizing JIT compiler might express the inline cache’s code directly in its IR, which has two outcomes: the structure check branches to OSR exit if it fails (causing abrupt termination of the optimized code’s execution), and all of the code for the inline cache (the structure check, the memory access, and any other steps) become eligible for low-level optimization by our DFG and B3 JIT compiler pipelines. Our compilers are good at making type-stable JavaScript property accesses perform great.\n\nArray accesses use similar techniques to detect if an object has array elements, and if so, how they are formatted. We support multiple kinds of storage for array elements depending on how they are being used. Inline caches detect what kind of array each array access is accessing, and we then emit code that speculates for that kind of array access.\n\nAnother technique we already use is virtual memory. For example, our WebAssembly implementation uses virtual memory tricks to check the bounds of linear memory accesses for free. We can catch page faults using POSIX signal handlers or Mach exceptions. The handler will know the exact machine state at the point of the fault, and has the power to transfer execution to any state it likes. WebAssembly uses this to throw an exception, but we can use it to transfer control flow to slow paths that handle the generic case of a memory access. Essentially, this means that we can save cycles on safety checks if we can express the condition being checked as something that causes the virtual memory system to issue a page fault. Concurrent JS will require a combination of inline caching and virtual memory tricks to make TID and SW checking cheap.\n\nInline caching means emitting different code for each property access, and then recompiling each property access potentially many times as we learn new information about what this property access may do. Inline caches are able to get incredibly precise information about the behavior of each property access because we always emit a fast path access that can only handle exactly those cases that we have seen so far. We learn new information by recording everything we know about those accesses that failed the fast path. The complete log of failed accesses is then LUBed (least-upper-bounded) together to create a minimal set of AccessCases. We can implement optimizations for new kinds of property accesses — such as the ones that have to check TID and SW bits — by considering in what ways a particular access site might be special and so specially optimizable. Below is a list of conditions we may encounter along with the strategy for how inline caches can test this condition and handle it.\n\nThese optimizations leave an unresolved issue: transitions. Transitions now require acquiring and releasing a lock. We have to do this anytime we add any property. In the next section, we show how to solve this problem using watchpoints. Then we describe how to implement transitions that need to create a segmented butterfly out of a flat one.\n\nTransitions are difficult to optimize. Every transition, including those that see TID = current, need to acquire the object’s internal lock to ensure that they set the butterfly, adjust the object’s type header, and store the new value of the property all in one atomic step. Luckily, we can dramatically improve the performance of transitions by using our engine’s structure watchpointing infrastructure.\n\nEach object has a structure. Many objects will share the same structure. Most inline cache optimizations begin with a check to see if the object’s structure matches the inline cache’s expectations. This means that when an inline cache is compiled, it has a pointer to the Structure object in hand. Each structure can have any number of watchpoint sets in it. A watchpoint set is simply a boolean field (starts valid, becomes invalid) and a set of watchpoints. When the set is fired (the field goes from valid to invalid), all watchpoints are invoked. We can add two watchpoint sets to Structure:\n\nThis enables the following optimizations on top of the inline cache optimizations described above:\n\nThe fact that we can elide TID != notTTLTID and SW == false checks means that reads and writes to those objects don’t actually have to check anything; they just need to mask off the high bits of the butterfly.\n\nMost importantly, this means that transitions that happen on the same thread that allocated the object don’t need any locking so long as the structures involved have valid transitionThreadLocal and writeThreadLocal watchpoint sets. Structures are dynamically inferred by our engine so as to have a close relationship to the code that creates those objects. Hence, if you write a constructor that adds a bunch of fields to this but does not escape this, then the structures corresponding to the chain of transitions that occurred in the constructor will all have a valid transitionThreadLocal and writeThreadLocal watchpoint sets. To make sure that the object continues to have a flat butterfly, you need to either never dyamically add properties to the object, or never write to the object on any thread other than the one that constructed it. Objects that play by these rules will experience almost no concurrency overhead, since property accesses will have at most one extra instruction (a mask) on the fast path.\n\nWatchpoints, and the operations that cause them to fire, will execute under safepoint: if we ever perform some operation that finds that it has to invalidate a watchpoint, it will do the operation while all other threads are stopped as if for a garbage collection. This means that if some optimized code is performing non-atomic transitions involving some structures, and some other thread attempts to write or transition an object that uses any of those structures, then it will not actually perform the write until that optimized code reaches a safepoint and gets invalidated. Most of the time, the watchpoint sets will tell us that they have been invalidated even before the optimizing JIT compilers try to install any watchpoints. We expect few watchpoint invalidations in steady state.\n\nTo summarize, if our optimizer is able to guess which object properties you will add to an object at the time of allocation, then the cost model of your object accesses does not change at all, since inline properties get concurrency for free. If you do have out-of-line properties, then they will perform almost exactly as they do now (occasionally, an extra arithmetic instruction will be involved in computing the butterfly access) so long as either the object is only written to by the thread that created it (and read by anyone), or no new properties are added to the object after creation (in which case it can be read and written by anyone). If you break this pattern, then transitions will become about 7x more expensive and all other object accesses will become 2x more expensive. This slow-down will be extremely surgical: only those property accesses that touch segmented butterflies will experience the slow-down. This system is designed to let you dynamically and concurrently add stuff to your objects, and the hope is that if you do so in moderation, you won’t see much of a change in performance.\n\nArray element accesses will benefit from TTL similarly to the way that named property accesses do:\n\nWe handle array transitions a bit specially. Many array transitions in JavaScriptCore already use locking because of their need to avoid races with the garbage collector. Adding locking to the remaining array transitions may cause performance issues, so this section considers an alternative.\n\nResizing an array in response to an out-of-bounds store or something like array.push is the most common kind of array transition. Fortunately, this transition does not change anything in the type header of the object — it only changes the butterfly pointer. Whether or not the butterfly has array elements is reflected in the structure. Therefore, we can just use CAS on the butterfly pointer, and then have a rule that any changes to butterfly pointers of objects that have array elements requires CAS even if the object lock is already held. Because array structures’ transitionThreadLocal and writeThreadLocal watchpoints are unlikely to be intact (any shared array use will invalidate them, since arrays share structures), we expect that even transitions on TTL arrays will have to use CAS in the common case. This butterfly pointer CAS is sufficient to ensure that a simultaneous attempt to make the array not TTL won’t get confused by our resize operation.\n\nOne CAS for array resizing is probably cheap enough to be practical. The CAS is likely cheap relative to the current costs of resizing, which involves allocation, copying data, and initializing the newly allocated memory.\n\nObjects that have both named properties and array elements will now have to use both locking and CAS on some of the transitions involving named properties. Fortunately, objects that have both array elements and named properties are sufficiently uncommon that we can probably get away with increasing their named property transition cost a bit.\n\nTurning flat butterflies into segmented ones requires a special kind of transition. Fortunartely, this transition is cheap. Butterfly fragments contain only data. They look just like fragments (fixed-size slices) of the payload of a flat butterfly. Therefore, we can transition a flat butterfly to a segmented one by allocating a spine and pointing its fragment pointers at the original flat butterfly.\n\nAny read or write to the flat butterfly while the butterfly is being transitioned to segmented will seem to users of the segmented butterfly to have happened to the fragments. In other words, although some threads may mistakenly think that the butterfly is still flat, their accesses to that butterfly will still be sound even after the butterfly is already segmented.\n\nMaking this work right requires making sure that the segmented butterfly’s fragments share the same memory layout as the flat butterfly that they were converted from. For this reason, the first array fragment contains the public length and the old vector length; it will remember the vector length that the flat butterfly used forever, and the real vector length will be in the segmented butterfly’s spine. This ensures that if there is a race between a flat butterfly array access and a flat-to-segmented transition, then the flat butterfly access will correctly know the flat butterfly’s size because its vector length will not change. To line up the object models, we also store out-of-line properties in reverse order in the out-of-line fragments, to match what flat butterflies do.\n\nThis works so long as the flat butterfly accesses loaded their butterfly pointer before the transition occured. If they load it later, then their TID check will fail, probably in the form of a page fault on an access to the butterfly.\n\nJavaScriptCore tries to make objects share structures whenever possible. This relies on two properties of structures:\n\nThis is a great optimization if it indeed causes objects to reuse structures. But some objects will have a unique structure no matter what the VM tries to do about it. JavaScriptCore tries to detect when this happens, and puts the object in dictionary mode. In dictionary mode, the structure has a 1:1 mapping to the object. Also, the structure becomes mutable. Adding and removing properties means editing the structure and the object in tandem.\n\nDeletion is closely related to dictionary mode, since deletion will immediately put the object in dictionary mode.\n\nIt’s already the case that mutations to a dictionary require holding the structure’s lock. This is necessary to support concurrent JIT and concurrent GC.\n\nTo support concurrent JS, we only need to make these changes:\n\nWe are not worried about the performance hit of grabbing a lock for all reads of a dictionary. It’s already relatively expensive to read a dictionary.\n\nThe existing facilities for safely transitioning objects will naturally support transitioning to dictionary mode. Usually, dictionary transitions don’t involve deleting properties. They happen when we detect that the program is adding so many properties to the object that it’s probably going to perform better as a dictionary. In that case, the fact that some other thread may be in the middle of accessing this object without holding any locks does not matter. For non-dictionary objects we require that only transitions take the lock. Reads and writes involve separate steps for checking the object’s type, loading the butterfly, and then accessing the butterfly. But if none of the properties that were added before the dictionary transition get deleted, then it’s fine for some other thread to race when accessing those old properties. We will call this the phenomenon of tardy accesses. Even though those tardy accesses don’t do any locking, they are correct for the same reasons that they are correct before the object becomes a dictionary. That problem is up to the butterfly object model, which will be either flat or segmented depending on whether the object is still TTL. Dictionary mode operates orthogonally to TTL inference and butterflies.\n\nBut if any of the properties added before the dictionary transition get deleted, then we have to handle this deletion specially. Normally, deletions cause the deleted slots to become reusable. We cannot do this here, because then a tardy read to some deleted property f might end up reading the value of some newly added property g. Or, a tardy write to some deleted property f might end up overwriting the value of some newly added property g. We can prevent either of these bad outcomes by simply not reusing the space freed up by deleted properties, if those properties had been added before the dictionary transition.\n\nThis does not lead to unbounded memory usage. When the GC does its safepoint, it already knows that all memory accesses have completed. Therefore, the simplest implementation is to have GC change the state of those deleted properties when it visits the object. Once the GC flags those property slots during a safepoint, future property additions can reuse those slots.\n\nOnce we enable concurrency, recompiling an inline cache becomes harder because you need to be careful when changing code that may be currently executing on another CPU. We plan to have a tiered defense against this problem: we will infer the thread-locality of code to use the same inline caches as we do now as much as possible, we will buffer inline cache changes whenever it’s safe to do so, and finally we will rely on safepoints if an inline cache needs to be reset eagerly.\n\nWe expect that in many programs, inline caches will reach steady state before the code ever executes on more than one thread. Hence, we plan to have each block of code track its thread-locality. So long as it has only ever executed on one thread, it will remember this and check for it on entry. So long as this is true, any inline caches within that code can be modified without any extra synchronization. We can track thread-locality on as fine-grain a level as we like; for example it can even be per-basic-block. It’s probably most natural if we use JavaScriptCore’s notion of CodeBlock as the granularity; this roughly corresponds to functions in the source code.\n\nOnce the thread-locality of code is broken, we can switch to buffering inline cache changes. Our PolymorphicAccess inline cache infrastructure already buffers changes because that’s most efficient even if we don’t have to do expensive synchronization. For inline caches that may be executing globally, we can globally buffer all changes. For example, the VM can perform once-per-millisecond safepoints to flush changes to all global inline caches.\n\nSometimes, we need to make an immediate change to an inline cache. When this happens, we will rely on our ability to safepoint the system — i.e. to stop all threads at a point where we can account for each thread’s state. This is not a fast operation when there are many threads. Java virtual machines already have to do something like this for class hierarchy invalidation and biased locking. By design, these eager invalidations are unlikely. We only perform optimizations that can lead to eager invalidations if we have profiling data that suggests that it would be unlikely.\n\nSo far, this algorithm relies on being able to sneak 16 bits of information into the high bits of the butterfly pointer. Some hardware will not allow us to do this. For example, fewer than 16 high pointer bits may be used for the all-zero check in virtual memory. If the system only allows for 8 checked high bits, then we will only be able to support 127 threads. Concurrent JavaScript would probably still be useful even if it had a hard 127 thread limit, but this would be an unusually low limit to impose at the language level. This section shows how to overcome this limit.\n\nIf the object model can only handle thread-locality inference for 127 threads, then we can either choose to have the 127th thread get no thread-locality inference or we can try to map more than one logical thread onto the same thread identifier. Threads mapped to the same TID won’t be able to execute concurrently to each other. To do this, we can borrow the idea of the GIL (global interpreter lock) from Python. The CPython implementation only allows 1 native thread to interpreting Python code at a time. It achieves this by having a lock (the so-called GIL) that protects the interpreter. The lock is released and reacquired periodically, which gives the appearance of concurrency. Since we can also release the lock around any potentially-blocking operations, we can even avoid deadlocks that arise from insufficient concurrency. We can apply this technique here: if we are limited to 127 threads, then we can have 127 locks protecting JS execution. So long as there are 127 or fewer threads, this lock will not do anything; anytime we try to release it, we will do nothing because the lock will tell us that nobody is waiting to acquire it. “Releasing and reacquiring” the lock will really be a cheap load and branch to verify that there is no need to release it.\n\nThis lock will be local to a thread pool rather than global to the whole engine, and it will protect all of our optimized paths rather than just protecting the interpreter. Hence the name: local optimizer lock, or LOL for short.\n\nDOM objects behave like JavaScript objects, but are actually a proxy for complicated logic implemented in C++. That logic is usually not thread-safe. The native code that supports the DOM transitively uses many native APIs that are meant to only be used from the main thread. It would take a lot of work to make the DOM completely thread-safe. Our strawman proposal only requires making the DOM global object capable of handling lookups to self properties, which we need to allow threads to access global JavaScript properties like Object and Thread.\n\nIn WebKit, variable resolution and self property resolution on the JSDOMWindow largely follows a pattern of relying on existing JS property lookup mechanisms. It uses exotic behavior when the window has a null frame. We already support installing a watchpoint on the non-nullness of frame. Hence, we can support fast concurrent accesses to properties of JSDOMWindow while honoring the frame special case by having threads use the existing watchpoint set. This implies that some of the JSDOMWindow slow paths will need locking, but that’s probably acceptable since the majority of global object accesses are inline cached.\n\nNative apps that want to dip their toes into concurrent JS may also want to restrict sharing for some of their classes. The thread-affinity check on accesses to objects will need to be implemented in the VM itself to give our compilers the ability to optimize it away. This means that it’s possible to expose the functionality to C/Objective-C API clients.\n\nWe think that we can make it possible to execute JavaScript concurrently in WebKit while providing good enough performance that developers would enjoy using this feature. At the heart of this technique is the combination of segmented butterflies, transition thread locality inference, and lots of cheap per-object locks. So long as programs obey certain behaviors, they should experience minuscule overheads: property accesses will cost about as much as they do today and objects will not require any extra memory. If some objects decide that they don’t want to play by our rules, they will get slightly higher overheads.\n\nSegmented butterflies are a straightforward combination of the array object model in the Schism garbage collector and the butterfly object model that we have used for a long time in JavaScriptCore.\n\nTransition-thread-locality inference is inspired by work on biased locking. As in the HotSpot biased locking scheme, we use types to reason about whether we have a guarantee of thread locality. Unlike that scheme, we don’t rely on deoptimization to break a thread-object relationship. Our primary mechanism of informing other threads that an object is no longer transition-thread-local is to have different tag bits in the butterfly pointer.\n\nThe combination of segmented butterflies, transition-thread-locality inference, and the ability of both schemes to fall back on per-object locking when things get weird is not something that we have seen before. Most object-oriented systems that allow concurrency do it either by having an object model that naturally avoids expensive-to-resolve races, like in Java, or using some mechanisms to restrict the amount of concurrency in the language.\n\nFor example, CPython uses a global interpreter lock (GIL) to ensure that the interpreter never races with itself. This is a powerful technique that captures some of what concurrency is about: once I/O or other kinds of blocking happen, you want your other threads to be able to do some useful work in the meantime. The GIL allows this, so it makes threads useful to a large class of applications. Unfortunately, it doesn’t allow programs to exploit parallelism. The best feature of the GIL is that it is easy to implement. For example, it could be used to implement our proposed thread semantics in any JS engine. The scheme in this post is all about full concurrency optimized for 64-bit platforms.\n\nAn effort called the Gilectomy is underway to remove CPython’s GIL and replace it with fine-grained locking and clever atomic algorithms. The Gilectomy is not yet as fast as stock CPython; both single-thread and multi-thread programs run significantly slower in the Gilectomy. The performance problems appear to be related to locking in the allocator (we plan to use thread-local allocation buffers) and in the reference counter (we don’t have reference counting). The Gilectomy does not remove locking from accesses to objects. Like JavaScript’s objects, Python’s objects are dictionaries that can resize dynamically. Most of our scheme is about how to make accesses to those objects fast even when multiple threads are reading and writing to the same object.\n\nPyPy also has a GIL removal effort underway, but they haven’t said much about how they plan to handle synchronizing object accesses aside from using locks. We will also have locks, but we also came up with optimizations to avoid locking in most cases.\n\nAnother approach was the title locking scheme in SpiderMonkey. It has since been removed. That scheme also involved per-object locks, but did not have our optimizations for avoiding locking in most cases.\n\nDaloze, Marr, Bonetta, and Mossenbock propose a scheme for concurrency in Truffle, a runtime that supports many dynamic languages including JavaScript. That scheme requires objects that are shared to use synchronization for all writes. Sharing is detected by a write barrier. When a thread-local object is stored into a shared object, the runtime will traverse objects transitively reachable from the escaping object. All of those objects are marked shared so that future writes to those objects use synchronization. Our scheme does not require synchronization on shared writes, except when those writes are transitions. Our scheme does not require traversing object graphs; transition thread locality inference is on a per-object basis. A TTL object may point to a non-TTL object or vice-versa.\n\nCohen, Tal, and Petrank recently introduced the layout lock, which allows fast reads and writes to objects that may have their layout changed. Readers need an extra load (which has to be fenced or dependent), writers have to acquire a read lock (which can be as cheap as a pair of fenced loads and a branch), and transitions have to acquire a write lock and do some extra book-keeping. We suspect that this has a similar cost model to segmented butterflies, except for writes. Segmented butterflies only require an extra dependent load for writes, which is a bit cheaper than acquiring a read lock, which requires two loads fenced around a store. Fencing loads around a store is inconvenient; for example forcing a store to happen before a load on x86 requires an xchg instruction for the store, which is more expensive than just doing a mov. On ARM it requires using acq/rel variants for the loads and stores. On the other hand, the extra dependent load for writing to a segmented butterfly requires no extra fencing on either x86 or ARM. Transitions and reads are probably equally fast with segmented butterflies and layout locks, but writes matter a lot to us. Writes happen often enough that segmented butterflies are likely to be noticeably faster than layout locks for the JavaScript object model. On the other hand, the method of segmentation is not easy to reproduce in many different kinds of data structures. Since it is more general, the layout lock could be useful for more complex data JSC data structures like SparseArrayValueMap and Map/WeakMap/Set. Those data structures may be too complicated for segmentation, but not too complicated for the layout lock. Like segmented butterflies, layout lock can be combined with transition thread locality inference to avoid doing any of the locking until it’s needed to protect racy transitions.\n\nThis post shows how WebKit’s JavaScript implementation can be modified to support threads. Our scheme allows for all JavaScript objects to be shared. Our scheme avoids locking on fast paths, like the fast paths for property accesses. We expect it to be possible to implement this scheme with low overheads. Serial code will experience no overhead, and concurrent code will only experience big overheads if it adds properties to an object that is being written to by multiple threads.\n\nThe next step for this wild thought experiment is to attempt to implement it and see if it works. We will be tracking progress under bug 174276.",

    "description": "The 2026 Senate hopeful says major corporations cost taxpayers far more than social safety net programs.",
    "fullText": "James Talarico, a 36-year-old former public school teacher and current Texas State Representative, is mounting a 2026 U.S. Senate campaign that challenges conventional wisdom about government spending and corporate responsibility. He represents a growing push to scrutinize corporate tax strategies and reframe the debate around who truly benefits from government support. His arguments about tax avoidance by Fortune 500 companies and wealthy executives are gaining traction among young voters and may influence future tax policy discussions if he gains higher office.\n\n​​During a recent taping of Jubilee Media’s web series Surrounded at the company’s Los Angeles studios, Talarico sat down with roughly 20 undecided Texas voters to debate his policy positions. The episode, which released on Monday, caught fire on social media after Talarico delivered a pointed reframing of conservative rhetoric about welfare spending. In a sharp challenge to long-standing political talking points about “welfare queens”—a term traditionally used to disparage low-income individuals receiving government benefits—Talarico flipped the script, arguing that the nation’s actual dependency on public resources flows upward, not downward.\n\n“The biggest welfare queens in this country are the giant corporations that don’t pay a penny in federal taxes,” he said. He also extended his critique to include wealthy executives, adding “the biggest welfare queens are the CEOs who get a tax deduction for flying on a private jet.”\n\nTalarico’s argument strikes at a real issue: Some of America’s largest corporations have legally structured their tax arrangements to minimize or eliminate federal income tax liability. This practice has drawn scrutiny from policymakers across the political spectrum and sparked ongoing debates about tax code reform.​ So, rather than accepting that welfare is primarily a lower-income issue, he argues the problem is systemic and benefits the wealthy.\n\nTalarico said his background as a middle school language arts teacher at Rhodes Middle School in San Antonio informed many of his policy positions.\n\n“I was a public school teacher, so I saw how when kids showed up hungry, they couldn’t learn,” he told local ABC affiliate KSAT in October. “Even my brightest students, even my hardest working students couldn’t succeed. Couldn’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps when they didn’t have boots.”​\n\nTo illustrate the point, he invoked a metaphor about teaching someone to fish: “If you’re gonna take your friend out on a boat for the day to teach him how to fish, you wanna make sure he had breakfast that morning. You wanna make sure he’s not sick, because that allows him to learn how to fish again,” he said.​\n\nSince his election to the Texas House in 2018 at age 28, Talarico has positioned himself as a champion of legislation targeting corporate and pharmaceutical industry practices. He was instrumental in passing legislation capping insulin copays at $25 per month in Texas and enabling the importation of lower-cost medications from Canada.\n\nHis Senate campaign messaging appears to hinge on this core idea: that fairness and personal responsibility should apply equally to billionaires and working people.\n\n“We don’t want dependency. We want to reward hard work. And I think that should apply to those billionaires, not just working people,” he said during the recent taping.\n\n​You can watch the entire Surrounded episode featuring James Talarico below:\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nThat’s because the One Big Beautiful Bill scrapped taxes on tips and overtime, giving these workers a noticeable boost in take-home pay.\n\nHassett added that the administration will launch “a big PR campaign at the beginning of the year urging people to file early” to make sure workers claim everything they’re owed.\n\nFor many households, that raises an immediate question: What’s the smartest way to use a sudden cash infusion? Whether you’re thinking about shoring up your finances, preparing for uncertainty, or putting that extra money to work, here are a few ways Americans may consider investing their potential windfall.\n\nThe U.S. stock market has been a powerful engine of wealth creation. Trump has pointed to that strength, recently saying, “the only thing that’s really going up big? It’s the stock market and your 401(k)s.” (2)\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 is up about 16% year to date and has gained roughly 84% over the past five years.",

    "description": "This tech giant's early entry into the AI space has helped it build a substantial revenue backlog that could propel its shares higher in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\n\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \"Magnificent Seven\" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\n\nThere is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\n\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. But it has come at a steep cost: as he enters the New Year and midterm elections loom, his once unshakeable hold on Republicans is slipping, say historians ​and analysts.\n\nBack in January, as Trump triumphantly returned to the White House for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much ‌of U.S. cultural life. He delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.\n\nLike all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the inevitable waning of power in his second ‌year. But he also begins the New Year with an erosion in political support.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are rebelling, and opinion polls show a growing number of voters are unhappy with the high cost of living, an aggressive immigration crackdown and a sense that Trump has pushed the boundaries of presidential power too far.\n\nTrump's approval rating slipped to 39% in recent days to nearly its lowest level of his current term as Republican voters soured on his handling of the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nNow, Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, threatening Trump's domestic agenda and raising the ⁠specter of a third impeachment by Democrats if they win control ‌of the House of Representatives.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said lowering inflation - which he blamed on former Democratic President Joe Biden - has been a priority for Trump since his first day back in office.\n\n\"Much work remains,\" Desai said, adding that Trump and his administration will continue to focus on the issue.\n\nMOST ‍POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s\n\nIn his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce, dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.\n\nHe has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies, canceled or restricted access to some ​vaccines, and attacked universities, law firms and media outlets.\n\nDespite promising to end the Ukraine war on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace ‌deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.\n\nAll modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.\n\nThe conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.\n\n\"Donald Trump has wielded power with fewer restraints in the last 11 months than any president since Franklin Roosevelt,\" said presidential historian Timothy Naftali.\n\nIn ⁠the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, ​which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support ​for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.\n\nAnalysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with rising living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.\n\nTrump hit the road this month ‍to promote his economic agenda and kick off ⁠what aides say will be multiple speeches next year to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.\n\nBut his meandering 90-minute address to supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month - in which he riffed on a range of subjects unrelated to the economy and derided the issue ⁠of \"affordability\" as a Democratic \"hoax\" - alarmed some Republican strategists.\n\nA Republican with close ties to the White House conceded that Trump faces headwinds on the economy heading into the New Year and the public mood on the rising cost of living has \"become ‌a persistent drag.\"\n\n\"We have to remind voters they need to give the president a full four years,\" said the Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity to more ‌freely discuss internal discussions.",

    "description": "\"Caution is vital when encountering them.\"",
    "fullText": "A dangerous critter has reappeared in one European country for the first time since the 1970s.\n\nThe oriental hornet was spotted near Split in a Kaštela quarry, Croatia Week reported in September.\n\nIt said that the insects were at peak activity and that stings could be likely. The species had previously been seen in Trieste, Italy, and may have traveled there by ship. It moved to neighboring Slovenia and then down the Adriatic coast to Dalmatia, the region that covers the southernmost part of Croatia.\n\n\"It is known that it was present before, but there has been no literature data since the 1970s, so it has retreated and is now returning to its old habitat,\" Nediljko Landeka of the Institute of Public Health told Dnevnik Nova TV, per Croatia Week.\n\nStrictly speaking, the oriental hornet may not be an invasive species in Croatia, which is at the limit of its range. But its long absence suggests that it could at least be a nuisance.\n\nInvasive species are plants and animals that are not native to an area. They can spread rapidly, taking over ecosystems that haven't evolved with or adapted to their presence. Without natural predators or similar mechanisms to keep them in check, they push out other species and unbalance the environment.\n\n\"The reappearance of the oriental hornet serves as a reminder of how species can resurface after decades and why caution is vital when encountering them,\" the outlet noted.\n\nThe oriental hornet looks like the European hornet but is reddish brown, and its yellow bands don't reach the end of its abdomen, as the U.S. Army Public Health Center Entomological Sciences Program shows. It should also not be confused with the Asian hornet.\n\nThe fascinating creature can convert solar radiation into electrical energy, according to National Geographic. But it is also a threat to dwindling honeybee populations, according to the Italian Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie.\n\nThe sting of the hornet can cause an allergic reaction and can even be fatal, so residents were advised to steer clear of nests. Treatment consists of washing the area with soap and water, as well as applying an antiseptic and cold compress. Those who experience worsening symptoms should seek medical care immediately, per Croatia Week.\n\nHow bad are the mosquitoes in your area?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIf the bug continues to spread, officials may have to take action. In the United Kingdom, for example, the government captured Asian hornets and used minute tracking devices to find their colonies. And in the United States, where the spotted lanternfly has become an invasive peril, biologists recommended removing certain invasive trees to spur local birds to develop an appetite for the planthopper.\n\nThat's because native plants are crucial to supporting native animals, and invasive species feed off one another. You can help by rewilding your yard and controlling pests naturally.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Heather Sterling stepped into the ring at the Texas Game Warden Training Center, ready to face an ambush by instructors acting as violent assailants.\n\nThe four-on-one drill is a rite of passage for those training to be game wardens, sworn officers who enforce state conservation laws. Nationwide, thousands of local and state police recruits are allowed into the profession only after passing similar drills – simulated fights for their lives.\n\nThe barrage of force against Sterling came rapidly, video obtained by The Associated Press shows. A surprise push from behind threw her to the floor. A right-handed punch to the back of the head knocked her down. Within two minutes, she was struck at least seven times in the head, the last blow knocking off her wrestling helmet.\n\n“Protect yourself!” an instructor yelled.\n\nSterling completed the drill but suffered a concussion. A dozen of her classmates — a third in all — were injured that day as they were repeatedly punched, tackled on a gym floor and thrown against padded walls, records show.\n\nWhile the drill was physically punishing, their experience was not unique. Since 2005, similar drills at law enforcement academies nationwide have been linked to at least a dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries, some resulting in disability, an AP investigation has found.\n\nEditor’s note: This is the third installment of AP’s Dying to Serve series. Find the previous stories here and here.\n\nThe drills — frequently referred to as RedMan training for the brand and color of protective gear worn by participants – are intended to teach law enforcement recruits how to defend themselves against combative suspects. They’re among the most challenging tests at police academies. Law enforcement experts say that when properly designed and supervised, they teach new officers critical skills for handling high-stress situations.\n\nBut critics say they can put recruits at risk of physical and mental abuse that runs some promising officers out of the profession. Academies have wide latitude in running such exercises, given a lack of national standards governing police training.\n\nSterling quit the academy after her drill. She's now speaking out, hoping to spark change in training practices nationwide.\n\n“I’m worried that someone is going to get killed,” said Sterling, who'd previously worked as a senior game warden and defensive tactics instructor in Wyoming. “This is a poorly disguised assault.”\n\nAn investigation by the agency that regulates law enforcement training found no wrongdoing in how the drill was conducted. An academy official told investigators the goal was to “overwhelm the cadet physically and mentally to force them to think while physically exhausted.”\n\nAn expert who reviewed the case told AP injuries happen during volatile training environments nationwide, but the Texas drill stood out for its design — recruits could not use force to defend themselves against the onslaught of assailants. He said the number of injuries was concerning.\n\n“To teach cadets how and when to defend themselves, only to put them in a doomsday scenario with the instruction that they’re not allowed to fight back, does not match any training curriculum I’ve seen,” said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander.\n\nA Wyoming game warden moves back to Texas\n\nIn October 2024, Sterling started the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s eight-month academy in rural central Texas, which boasts of producing “the best-trained conservation officers in the country.”\n\nGame wardens — called conservation officers or wildlife troopers in some states — enforce hunting and fishing laws. They carry firearms, have arrest powers, are often among the first to respond to emergencies and rescue missions.\n\nSterling said she loved serving as a game warden for nearly five years in Wyoming, where she sometimes shooed moose and mountain lions away from towns. Patrolling without backup, she said, she had some “very tense conversations” with suspects and had to restrain some in handcuffs.\n\nShe said almost everyone she encountered during hunting season was armed and potentially dangerous, but she prided herself on responding alertly and calmly. She never had to fight a suspect, and none of the 40 wardens she taught self-defense had been in a significant use-of-force incident.\n\nSterling applied in Texas to live closer to family, hoping for a similar law-enforcement role in her home state. She grew up as the daughter of a Dallas police officer and ran track and cross-country at Texas A&M.\n\nThe academy scheduled the four-on-one drill for Dec. 13, 2024, after five weeks of arrest and control training.\n\nInstructors told cadets they couldn't defend themselves and were only to punch and kick a shield held by instructors, Sterling recalled. They discussed how some cadets had been seriously injured and terminated from previous academies for performing poorly.\n\nSterling told AP she was confused by the drill’s purpose. She'd never been ambushed by one person, let alone four. If that happened, she’d be able to use a firearm or other force to defend herself. As an instructor, she said, she would have never approved such a scenario or allowed punches to the head and neck.\n\nA female classmate who had previously worked as a police officer resigned rather than participate. She later told investigators she saw the drill as inappropriate and part of an academy culture of unprofessional training and hazing.\n\nBut Sterling felt she had no choice if she wanted to stay in her profession. She completed a cardio exercise, and the drill began.\n\nCombat drills take various forms nationwide\n\nAcademies have discretion to design training within state guidelines, and AP found the drills take many forms at local police, county sheriff and state departments. They’re sometimes called “combat training,” “Fight Day” or “stress reaction training.”\n\nRecruits like Sterling must ward off several assailants at once. Others fight a series of instructors, one after another. Some academies intentionally use larger, more skilled instructors. In Kentucky, one scenario requires fighting a combative suspect in a pool.\n\nThe stated goals are generally the same: to use skills learned in the academy to fend off or subdue assailants and to never give up.\n\nRecruits and instructors wear protective gear to cushion their heads from blows. But there are no uniform safety guidelines, including whether academies must have medical personnel on site.\n\nLawyers for some Black and female former trainees have alleged that instructors targeted their clients with excessive force to try to run them out of the profession. Several of the deaths have been of Black men hoping to join disproportionately white police forces.\n\nAmid the deaths and criticism, experts are encouraging academy directors to retire or modify any problematic drills.\n\nThe drills “can quickly devolve into abusive rites of passage” without appropriate focus and oversight, said Brian Baxter, who oversaw training at the Texas Department of Public Safety and now leads a group that studies the use of force. Some instructors want to win rather than allow recruits to practice their skills, he added.\n\n“The idea that we’re just punching each other to see who’s toughest ... that’s when it becomes inappropriate,” said Baxter, whose former agency overhauled its practices after a trooper died in 2005 from getting hit several times in the head. “There needs to be a problem that’s being solved by this training. And that problem needs to be directly related to public service.”\n\nFor this Texas academy class, injuries were widespread\n\nFor Sterling, the drill came to an end when she simulated holding her assailants at gunpoint and put them in handcuffs.\n\nLater that day, she had a pounding headache. Her knee swelled, and she’d skinned her elbow on the floor.\n\nAt least 13 of 37 cadets reported injuries: concussion symptoms; a fractured wrist; a torn MCL; sprained wrists and knees; a bruised nose, records show.\n\nTwo recruits needed surgery. Some were told the injuries were due to their lack of preparation and poor technique, and had to redo the drill.\n\nSterling said she wasn't offered medical care. She recalled vomiting while driving herself for emergency treatment. A doctor found she suffered a concussion that resulted from an assault, a medical record provided by Sterling shows.\n\nSterling had passed the drill, but turned in her resignation.\n\n“I have a very high sense of what is right and what is wrong,\" she told AP. \"I did not want to be part of what was happening at the academy anymore.”\n\nDeaths and injuries across the country\n\nNationwide, deaths and injuries have been blamed on a mix of trauma from punches and other force, overexertion, heat stroke, dehydration, and organ failure.\n\nIn August, 30-year-old Jon-Marques Psalms died two days after a training exercise at the San Francisco Police Academy. He suffered a head injury while fighting an instructor in a padded suit.\n\nAn autopsy found his death was an accident caused by complications of muscle and organ damage “in the setting of a high-intensity training exercise.” His family has filed a legal claim against the city and hired experts for a second autopsy.\n\nIn November 2024, a 24-year-old Kentucky game warden recruit died after fighting an instructor in a pool to the point of collapse, video obtained by AP shows. William Bailey’s death was ruled an accidental drowning due to a “sudden cardiac dysrhythmia during physical exertion.”\n\nA year earlier, a Denver police recruit had both legs amputated after a training fight that his attorney called a “barbaric hazing ritual.” An Indiana recruit died of exertion after he was pummeled by a larger instructor, and a classmate was disabled after fighting the same man.\n\nInvestigations of Austin’s police academy in Texas found that physical and psychological abuse from such exercises resulted in “a significant number” of cadets injured, ranging from dehydration to broken bones, and led to reforms. Black and female cadets represented a disproportionate number of those who were injured and quit.\n\nMacho Products Inc., which sells RedMan Training Gear nationwide, cautions in its warranty that such training “always presents risks of accidental injury, disability, and death that must be assumed by all participants.\" The document says risks can be minimized through “carefully planned scenarios conducted at appropriate levels of force.” A company spokesperson didn’t respond to AP's request for comment on recent deaths and injuries.\n\nFormer cadet compares the drill to a gang initiation ritual\n\nAlarmed by the injuries to Sterling and others, a state lawmaker's office contacted the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement to seek an investigation.\n\nAfter reviewing videos, investigating the injuries, and interviewing instructors and some recruits, the investigation found the drill was conducted in a “control and organized manner, with safety measures in place and training objectives clearly communicated.” The videos did not show instructors acting overly aggressive to Sterling, or any other “actions that were inappropriate or inconsistent with the established training guidelines,” it found.\n\n“While multiple cadets sustained minor to moderate injuries during the drill, the majority recovered without extended medical consequences or changes to their training status,\" the report said.\n\nThe Texas Parks and Wildlife Department declined to comment and refused to release records, citing the potential for litigation.\n\nSterling, who has returned to Wyoming and still works in law enforcement, was outraged by the state's defense of the drill, which she compared to a gang initiation ritual.\n\n“New members are physically beaten down by the gang membership,” she said, “which now considers you as its property.”",

To expand capacity and production across our maritime industrial base, we will acquire these ships using a lead yard, and competitive follow-on strategy for multi-yard construction. Shipyards will be measured against one outcome: delivering combat power to the Fleet as fast as possible.\"\n\nSmall surface combatants have always been essential to the fleet, handling a wide range of missions where a large warship isn't required. The FF(X) will continue this vital role, and will take on more routine operations, enhancing the fleets operational flexibility, adaptability, and mission readiness, according to a press release.\n\n\"Like the Medium Landing Ship, leveraging a complete design and production baseline approach will allow the Navy and shipbuilders to reduce costs, schedule and technical risk,\" said Adm. Daryl Caudle, 34th Chief of Naval Operations. \"We know this Frigate design works, we know it operates with the Fleet, and most importantly, we know how to build it now.\"\n\nFF(X) is engineered for rapid, cost-effective production, enabling this vital capability to the fleet faster. This is made possible by basing the new frigate on HII’s proven Legend-Class National Security Cutter. This approach leverages a mature design to deliver ships to our sailors without delay, as per the release.\n\nCurrently, Ingalls is simultaneously building three classes of ships (DDG 51 Flight III, LHA, and LPD Flight II) and modernizing the Zumwalt-class of guided missile destroyers with technology upgrades including the incorporation of the conventional prompt strike weapons system. Ingalls supported the U.S. Coast Guard for nearly two decades by building and delivering 10 Legend-class national security cutters (NSCs). The final cutter was delivered in October 2023.",

Around 200 passengers who were in the five derailed coaches have been moved to Guwahati in a different train,” Sharma said.\n\nSpeeding trains hitting wild elephants is not rare in Assam, which is home to an estimated 7,000 wild Asiatic elephants, one of the highest concentrations of the pachyderm in India.

    "fullText": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ, accusing the current administration of trying to use the former president as a “scapegoat.”\n\n“The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” Ureña, who has worked for Clinton for several decades, said in statement on X. “This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, this isn’t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.”\n\nAs Ureña went on, he called out Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles, noting the latter said on the record that “Donald Trump was wrong about Bill Clinton” and his claim that the prominent Democrat visited Epstein’s infamous private island multiple times. (Wiles later clarified that there was “no evidence” proving Trump’s claims.)\n\n“There are two types of people here,” Clinton’s deputy chief of staff continued. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”\n\nPer Ureña, “everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.”\n\nRepresentative for the White House and the DOJ did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nThe federal government began releasing files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, a month after President Trump ordered their release following a bipartisan push in Congress. As journalists began to comb through the files, photos of Clinton and Michael Jackson surfaced — though, large chunks of the files had also been redacted.\n\nMany have criticized the DOJ over the release, with many noting the Epstein Files Transparency Act meant the government was meant to hand over all of the documents Friday.\n\nThough, the White House has sung a different tune over the files drop. White House spokesperson Abigail Johnson said in a statement that “the Trump Administration is the most transparent in history.”\n\n“By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said.\n\nThe post Bill Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff Hits Back at Trump Administration Over Epstein Files Drop: ‘They’ll Try and Hide Forever’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Packers' mistakes vs. Bears: How Green Bay's miscues led to damaging loss to division rival originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bears' failure to get a field goal attempt off before the two-minute warning was supposed to be the death knell for Ben Johnson's team on Saturday night. Instead, it directly preceded a massive momentum shift that turned the game Chicago's way.\n\nA successful onside kick, which couldn't be handled by the Green Bay Packers, suddenly breathed life into the Bears and set the stage for a miraculous 22-16 overtime win that could very well have decided the NFC North.\n\nThe Packers' inability to bring in the onside kick was the most glaring mistake of the night for Matt LaFleur's squad, but it wasn't the only miscue that changed the complexion of the game.\n\nHere's a look at how the Packers' mistakes may have decided the NFC North.\n\nNFL Week 16 picks against the spread\n\nAfter the game, LaFleur said there were \"too many errors in critical moments that got us beat,\" naming three in particular and giving credit to the Bears for taking advantage.\n\nIt won't receive as much attention as the Packers' later mistakes, but Josh Jacobs' fumble at the two-yard line in the third quarter proved to be costly for Green Bay. The Packers wasted a scoring opportunity with a chance to stretch a three-point lead to 10, giving the Bears some life after nearly quieting the crowd.\n\nNahshon Wright's breakout season continues!\n\nHe forces a fumble inside the 5 🐻\n\nGBvsCHI on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/KyXTLxP3vF\n\nTo be fair, the Packers did force a punt on the ensuing drive and score a touchdown before the end of the quarter to push their lead to 13-3. Had Green Bay added another score on the drive that ended in a fumble, even if only a field goal, the entire game could have ended differently. Then again, there is no way to blame the loss solely on Jacobs' fumble when the Packers still couldn't protect a 13-3 lead later on.\n\nMORE: NFC North standings and playoff picture\n\nIn a moment that undoubtedly brought back a painful memory for Packers fans, Green Bay gave the Bears new life when Romeo Doubs failed to bring in an onside kick with less than two minutes remaining in regulation.\n\nBears recover the onside kick 👀👀\n\nGBvsCHI on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/gabjYXsJXB\n\nBecause Chicago failed to get a field goal attempt off before the two-minute warning, recovering an onside kick was effectively the Bears' only chance to put the ball back in Caleb Williams' hands while trailing by a touchdown. Onside kicks are even harder to recover now than they were 11 years ago, when Brandon Bostick whiffed on the Seattle Seahawks' attempt—making Saturday's moment even more painful for the Packers.\n\nThe Bears then drove down the field and tied the game on a touchdown pass to Jahdae Walker, despite not having scored a touchdown in the first 59 minutes.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the game, LaFleur said he has to watch the play again to determine whether there was a blocking issue, but he admitted Doubs \"had the opportunity to field the ball\" and should have been able to bring it in.\n\nWhen the Packers were one yard away from a fresh set of downs to move into more comfortable field goal range in overtime, another mistake derailed their plans. The snap to Malik Willis ended up on the ground almost instantly, and the Bears quickly swarmed toward the ball to prevent Green Bay from advancing it for a first down.\n\nSNAP IS FUMBLED. BEARS TAKE OVER\n\nGBvsCHI on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/vdn3aKwDOo\n\nHad the Packers picked up a first down, they could have attempted a field goal without moving the chains again. Instead, Matt LaFleur's best fourth down play never saw the light of day, and the Bears took over on downs and took advantage of the solid field position to set up a quick game-winning touchdown drive.\n\nMORE:How long is Jordan Love out with concussion?\n\nHere's a look at the updated NFC North standings after Chicago's win:\n\nThe Bears haven't yet clinched a playoff berth, as they need a Detroit Lions loss to do so in Week 16, but their path to a division title is simple: win and in.\n\nOne more win would give Chicago its first NFC North title since 2018 and cap an improbable first season under coach Ben Johnson, potentially setting the stage for a top-two seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Packers, meanwhile, are one loss or Bears win away from being eliminated from NFC North contention, though they remain in a playoff spot as the NFC's No. 7 seed.\n\nMORE: Meet Jordan Love’s volleyball-player wife and the rest of his family",

(USF) – The University of Sioux Falls Men’s Basketball team closed the calendar year with offensive performance, knocking off Minnesota State 98–90 on Saturday afternoon inside the Stewart Center. Behind balanced scoring, dominance on the glass, and an aggressive approach against the Mavericks’ size, the Cougars earned a statement NSIC victory heading into the holiday break.\n\nSioux Falls leaned into its physicality and depth to secure the win, finishing with four players scoring 16 or more points and posting a decisive rebounding edge. USF shot 42.5 percent from the field while generating 52 points in the paint and 23 second-chance points. Bryon Laue delivered a breakout performance with 18 points and a game-high 16 rebounds, while Brandon Hrncir and Brogan Madson each added 18 points as the Cougars consistently attacked mismatches.\n\nThe Cougars took control at the free-throw line and in transition during the second half, converting 24-of-28 free throws after the break and scoring 22 fast-break points for the game. Jacoby Mehrman added 16 points on efficient shooting, and Camden Davis chipped in 10 points off the bench as USF outscored Minnesota State 54–49 in the second half to close out the 98–90 victory.\n\nThe opening 20 minutes featured a steady back-and-forth, with Sioux Falls building offense through paint touches and extra possessions. USF shot 43.6 percent from the field in the half and generated early success on the offensive glass, finishing the game with 23 offensive rebounds. Laue set the tone early on the boards, while Hrncir and Madson combined to keep the Cougars in rhythm offensively.\n\nMinnesota State shot efficiently in the first half at 47.2 percent, but Sioux Falls countered by limiting perimeter damage and forcing the Mavericks to earn points inside. The Cougars went 8-of-11 at the free-throw line in the half and carried a 44–41 advantage into the locker room.\n\nSioux Falls seized control after halftime by attacking relentlessly and capitalizing at the stripe. The Cougars scored 54 second-half points and went 24-of-28 at the free-throw line, repeatedly punishing Minnesota State for fouling. Mehrman and Hrncir were effective in finishing through contact, while Madson orchestrated the offense and drew fouls attacking downhill.\n\nAlthough Minnesota State shot 51.5 percent in the half and scored 49 points, USF offset that efficiency with rebounding, transition scoring, and second-chance opportunities. The Cougars won the rebounding battle 49–33 and turned those extra possessions into timely buckets and free throws, allowing them to maintain separation and close out the win.\n\n“I thought we played very well on the offensive end against their size. We had some guys really step up, notably Laue, Mehrman, and Hrncir. A fun way to go into the break.”\n— Head Coach Chris Johnson\n\nBryon Laue – 18 points, 16 rebounds, 7-of-14 FG\n\nBrandon Hrncir – 18 points, 9 rebounds, 7-of-8 FT\n\nBrogan Madson – 18 points, 6 assists, 9-of-12 FT\n\nJacoby Mehrman – 16 points, 5 rebounds, 6-of-11 FG\n\nKyle Ingwerson – 10 points, 2 steals\n\nRebounding: Sioux Falls dominated the glass 49–33, including 23 offensive rebounds that led to 23 second-chance points.\n\nFree Throws: The Cougars went 32-of-39 at the line, including 24-of-28 in the second half.\n\nPaint: USF scored 52 points in the paint by consistently attacking Minnesota State’s interior.\n\nTransition: Sioux Falls tallied 22 fast-break points, capitalizing on defensive stops and rebounds.\n\nBalance: Five Cougars scored in double figures as USF spread scoring across the lineup.\n\nThe Cougars return to action on January 3, traveling to Marshall, Minnesota, to take on Southwest Minnesota State at 2:00 p.m.",

Boston outplayed the Canucks and had more than twice as many shots on goal, but made several costly mistakes and mental lapses that came back to haunt them.\n\nThe Bruins had multiple chances to win the game in shootouts but failed to score in all seven of their opportunities, missing out on a point in the process.\n\nAfter the game, head coach Marco Sturm was clearly disappointed in the final outcome and didn’t hold back in his analysis.\n\nBrick asked Marco Sturm if he thinks the Bruins deserved to win this game.

Unfortunately, it just cost us a point.”\n\nSturm acknowledged that Boston played well early on but wasn’t able to maintain it for the full 60 minutes, failing to put Vancouver away and allowing them to come back with sloppy miscues.\n\n“Those kinds of teams, you have to put away early on, and we just didn’t,” Sturm added. “And all of a sudden, little things make a big difference. Special teams again. But yeah, it was just unfortunate.”\n\nAfter losing three of their last four games, the Bruins will look to bounce back against the Ottawa Senators at home on Sunday.\n\nMarco Sturm Details Bruins’ Lineup Changes Against Canucks",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter losing Micah Parsons, the Green Bay Packers will likely have to start leaning a bit more heavily on their offense. That would be difficult without QB Jordan Love.\n\nLove exited Saturday's game against the Chicago Bears with a concussion after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit from Austin Booker. While Love was able to leave the field under his own power, he did not return and was later formally diagnosed with a concussion.\n\nThe Packers have full confidence in backup quarterback Malik Willis, who won two starts in place of Love last season, but they will want to be at full strength for a pivotal Week 17 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Love’s outlook for Green Bay’s next game.\n\nNFL Week 16 picks against the spread\n\nThe Packers' next game is also a Saturday contest, which means Love would need to clear concussion protocol in seven days after his injury.\n\nThe length of time needed to recover from a concussion is dependent on each individual player, but the average length of time in the concussion protocol is about nine days, CBS Sports reported in 2023.\n\nThat doesn't mean Love can't make it back in time to face the Ravens. Plenty of players do suffer a concussion and suit up the following week, but it's virtually impossible to predict how a player's body will respond and how long it will take for symptoms to dissipate.\n\nLove will need to return to practice in the week ahead before he can play as part of the protocol, so his practice status later in the week could give fans an early sign about his availability. If Love can't play, Willis would get the start at home against Baltimore.\n\nAfter the loss, coach Matt LaFleur said he did not have any update on the concussed Love.\n\nMORE:How Packers-Bears game impacts NFC North race\n\nHere are the steps players have to take to leave the concussion protocol:\n\nIn this initial phase, players are instructed to avoid most activity. They are expected to rest and limit anything that could aggravate their symptoms. Eventually, players may progress to limited stretching and light aerobic exercise, provided they are supervised by team training staff.\n\nPlayers will start to work on cardio exercises along with stretching and training, with team medical staff supervising. After this phase, players can start working on balance testing.\n\nIn the third stage, players can take part in football-specific exercises and start working with the team for up to 30 minutes under supervision. Players are also able to increase their cardio workloads.\n\nPlayers reaching the fourth stage are able to start throwing, catching and running and engage in activities more specific to their position. They also can continue to ramp up their exercise and training. By end of this phase, players have to have undergone neurocognitive and balance testing.\n\nThe player has to be cleared by both the club physician and the independent neurological consultant to return to full activity.\n\nMORE:Complete guide to NFL concussion protocol\n\nThe Packers will close out their season with matchups against the Ravens and Minnesota Vikings.\n\nGreen Bay's final home game will come against a Ravens team desperate to stay in AFC North contention, while a resurgent Vikings squad will try to play spoiler in some form against the Packers in Week 18.",

After leaving the field to be evaluated, he was replaced by backup Malik Willis.\n\nAfter the game, Matt LaFleur said he didn't have any new updates on the concussed Love.\n\nLove hasn't missed a start since the opening month of the 2024 season, though Willis filled in admirably during that absence, winning his two starts as an injury replacement.\n\nNFL Week 16 picks against the spread\n\nLove suffered an apparent head injury on a helmet-to-helmet hit from Bears DT Austin Booker in the first half of Saturday's game against the Bears.\n\nThe hit knocked Love backward and left him visibly shaken up, but he was able to walk off the field himself after being tended to by trainers for a handful of minutes.\n\nLove was diagnosed with a concussion on Saturday and ruled out for the remainder of the game. The Packers' next game is also a Saturday night contest, so Love will have exactly a week to be cleared to start against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nLove is backed up by Malik Willis, who is in his second season with the Packers.\n\nA former third-round pick of the Tennessee Titans, Willis struggled to earn an opportunity to see the field in Nashville and was traded to Green Bay in the days leading up to the 2024 season.\n\nDespite the short turnaround, Willis won his first two starts in a Packers uniform in place of an injured Love in Weeks 3 and 4 last season.\n\nLove is the clear-cut franchise quarterback in Green Bay, even if he still has room for growth, and the Packers are totally comfortable with Willis as their backup after his brief but impressive stint in place of Love early in 2024.\n\nThe Packers' emergency No. 3 quarterback is Clayton Tune, but he is not on the active roster, meaning RB Josh Jacobs is Green Bay's likely emergency quarterback, according to Matt LaFleur.\n\nA fifth-round pick out of Houston in 2023, Tune spent his first two seasons with the Arizona Cardinals and made one start before being cut loose at the end of training camp this year. Tune has been on Green Bay's practice squad since joining the organization in late August.",

    "fullText": "The trip to Edmonton will be one of soul searching for the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nOn Saturday, the Golden Knights saw their point streak snapped at eight games in emphatic fashion in a 6-3 loss to the Calgary Flames.\n\nThe game was messy early, which the Flames took advantage of on a broken play. After a shot went off the post and through the five hole of Akira Schmid, the puck found its way to Mikael Backlund’s stick. The Flames captain made no mistake to get the home team on the board first.\n\nThe second Flames goal came with some controversy attacked. Calgary defenseman Yan Kuznetsov was able to fire a slapshot past Schmid, but Adam Klapka ran him while the play was ongoing. However, due to the goal being scored prior to the contact, the goal stood with no goalie interference.\n\nJust as the game was getting away, however, the Golden Knights were able to strike back. Mark Stone was able to find Reilly Smith on a breakaway, who was able to beat Devin Cooley with a deke to his backhand for his fourth goal of the season.\n\nUnfortunately, the Golden Knights gave the momentum back on a poor defensive play. Allowing two players to get behind everyone, Vegas could only watch as Ryan Lomberg finished an odd-man rush to get a two-goal lead back to Calgary.\n\nThe second period did not get much better. Mikael Backlund put his second of the game early, and a shorthanded goal from Joel Farabee put the Golden Knights on the wrong end of a blowout.\n\nKaedan Korczak did his part to make the game look better, though. Mitch Marner was able to find the defenseman, who beat Cooley with a shot through traffic for his fourth of the season.\n\nThe third period would see the Golden Knights make a push, headlined by a Mark Stone power-play marker to cut deeper into the lead, but Jonathan Huberdeau’s empty net goal sealed the defeat for Vegas.",

    "fullText": "Steve Kerr hits back at the referees for \"weak\" Draymond Green ejection originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors got a much-needed win by beating the Phoenix Suns 119-116. It would have been a disastrous loss for Golden State, as it would have been their fourth consecutive defeat. Thankfully for the Warriors, Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler combined for 53 points.\n\nDraymond Green only got to play eight minutes, as he was ejected from the game with two technical fouls. It was a surprising call because most people did not expect that to happen, but the Warriors had to play almost the whole game without their best defender.\n\nWarriors head coach Steve Kerr admits that at least one technical foul was warranted because Green was talking to the referees. However, Kerr disliked that the second technical was quickly called on Green, which led to the ejection.\n\nKerr was livid about the call, which led to him also getting a technical foul. It was a bad stretch for the Warriors because they lost a top defender and playmaker. However, it appeared that the Warriors were fueled by Green's ejection.\n\nMore: Ranking 3 Key Golden State Warriors Trade Targets\n\n\"I thought it was weak. He was yelling at the refs, so he definitely deserved one. But then, he was walking to the bench, and he yelled something, and the second technical. We saw one guy on their team literally punch Steph in the stomach the other night. Pre-meditated, punches him in the stomach, no ejection for that,\" Kerr said after the game.\n\nDillon Brooks was the player that Kerr was talking about, which was why he was livid. Kerr wanted to call it out because it was not the best moment for the referees, given the context a couple of days prior.\n\nThe Warriors needed a win after their struggles in the past few weeks. They lost to the same Suns team on Thursday, so they wanted to get revenge for that. However, it was a tough matchup for the Warriors, especially when Green got ejected.\n\nThankfully for the Warriors, Curry and Butler stepped up in his place. Curry himself credited the ejection as some sort of a wake-up call for the Warriors, as they needed that to get the win.\n\nMore: Warriors' Steph Curry makes basketball history never done in NBA for his position\n\n\"Yeah, it's tough. We were energized at the beginning of the game, knowing that it was a good opportunity to bounce back. There was a weird, choppy, physical game in the first quarter. It spilled into the second, I think it woke us up because we knew without him, we had to play tougher,\" Curry said after the game about the ejection.\n\nNow, the Warriors are 14-15 on the season, clinging to the eighth seed in the Western Conference. It will be a tough stretch moving forward, but the Warriors are ready to improve in their quest to make the postseason.",

He's also thrown five interceptions and has been sacked nine times.\n\nAs for Taylor, the veteran has been decent when called upon this year, throwing for 779 yards with a 59.7 percent completion percentage to go along with five TDs and five INTs. At 36 years old, Taylor has still shown his capabilities with his legs, rushing for 143 yards and a touchdown on 27 attempts in six games (four starts).",

    "fullText": "The wisdom was that for the San Diego State Aztecs to knock off the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats in the Hall of Fame Series, everything would have to go right.\n\nThey got a gritty defensive effort that held the top-ranked team to equaling its fewest first half points of the season, but the offense disappeared into the desert night in a 68-45 loss at the Mortgage Matchup Center in Phoenix on Saturday night.\n\nSDSU (6-4) shot a season-low 26.3% from the field, with Reese Dixon-Waters scoring 8 points and the Aztecs not getting a second player with multiple field goal makes until Tae Simmons battled a bucket home nearly four minutes into the second half.\n\nMeanwhile Arizona (11-0) got 11 points each from Jaden Bradley and Koa Peat, while Tobe Awaka had 15 rebounds and Motiejus Krivas had 13 rebounds and three blocks. In addition to having five players in double-figure scoring, the Wildcats had a 20-10 edge in offensive rebounding () overall and had a 32-24 edge in paint scoring.\n\nThe Aztecs watched a 7-point lead disappear thanks to an 8-0 Arizona run to close the first half, and their shooting woes continued after halftime. Just three makes over the first 10 minutes of the second, as the Scarlet and Black settled for mid-range and perimeter jump shots instead of attacking the rim. They had 13 attempts at the line in the opening half, but it took until the 8:03 mark to draw the second Wildcats foul out of the break.\n\nArizona generated a 15-8 edge in free throw attempts in the second half, and had a 27-19 edge in freebie tries for the game.\n\nThe Wildcats relentlessly attacked the paint, which also created additional space for their shooters to start making from downtown. Back-to-back 3’s from Anthony Dell’Orso and Dwayne Aristode gave the Wildcats their first double-digit lead (47-34) at the 11 minute mark and forced a timeout.\n\nArizona’s length and height gave the Aztecs fits all night on offense, with SDSU making just eight field goals in the first half and seven in the second half. BJ Davis saw his seven-game streak of scoring in double-figures end after going 1 of 12 shooting, as he, Dixon-Waters and Miles Byrd combined to go 5 of 29 from the field.\n\nFor much of the first half the game was played at the Aztecs tempo, with the Wildcats only able to manage 3 points on the fast break. The defense also held an Arizona offense that averaged nearly 31 shot attempts per half to 25, as early foul trouble for Peat meant the Wildcats top scorer played only seven minutes.\n\nAfter Bradley’s pair of free throws just after the first media timeout, SDSU got back-to-back scores when Pharaoh Compton converted a pair at the line and then Jeremiah Oden splashed a 3-pointer to give the Scarlet and Black the lead that they held for over 15 minutes.\n\nDixon-Waters made his first of two jumpers in the opening 20, the only Scarlet and Black player to do so, which kicked off a mini 6-0 run that pushed the lead out to 8 points near the midway mark. Davis made a pair of free throws and a Magoon Gwath paint bucket, but the make by the big at the 10:07 was SDSU’s third-to-last of the half.\n\nThe Aztecs made just two of their final 14 shots from the field, with Dixon-Waters hitting a shot and then Tae Simmons battling for a bucket on the block. But the 7 point lead evaporated over the final 1:49 of the half as the Wildcats closed it on an 8-0 run.\n\nA key moment came with Bradley on the line again, when head coach Brian Dutcher was called for a technical foul. While Dell’Orso made just one of the two free throws, it brought life to the crowd, which roared as the senior guard hit Arizona’s first 3-pointer of the half with 32 seconds left for a 28-27 halftime lead.\n\nSDSU returns to The Mesa for their final pre-holidays game on Tuesday, Dec. 22, when they face the DIII Whittier College Poets at 1 p.m. at Viejas Arena.",

    "fullText": "Australia have beaten England by 82 runs in the third Test to go 3-0 up and secure the Ashes at the earliest opportunity.\n\nBen Duckett – 2 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best openers in the world, only to suffer a collapse in form and presence. Failures of others were predictable, Duckett's was not and is a huge concern.\n\nZak Crawley – 6 – Showed admirable fight and adaptability in England's second innings, but probably needs a hundred to be immune from a post-series clearout.\n\nOllie Pope – 2 – Test career over for now? Averages 17.6 in Ashes Tests. Since 1900, only England's Dennis Amiss has had as many as Pope's 16 innings in the top six in Ashes Tests and averaged less.\n\nJoe Root – 4 – Two starts, without making a telling contribution. Twice dismissed by Cummins, for whom Root is a bunny. The Yorkshireman must be pleased the Australia captain missed the first two Tests of the series.\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Largely stayed true to his promise to \"rein it in\", but the second-innings dismissal reverse-sweeping Lyon was ugly. Would be a huge waste if Australia does not see his best on this tour.\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Battled bravely in England's first innings, even if his resistance never seemed likely to turn into a trademark miracle. Did not bowl when England needed him on day three.\n\nJamie Smith – 6 – Finally got into the series with a counter-attacking 60 in the second innings, now has to kick on in Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nWill Jacks – 6 – A part-time spinner unfairly asked to do the job of a veteran. Resisted admirably with the bat, making himself harder to leave out.\n\nBrydon Carse – 5 – Continuing a bizarre tour of picking up wickets despite not bowling well. England have a decision to make over the Durham man in Melbourne.\n\nJofra Archer – 8 – Emerging as England's player of the tour. A maiden Test half-century and first five-wicket haul in six years. Demonstrating it was more than worth the wait for him to return to full fitness.\n\nJosh Tongue – 6 – Encouraging return after being overlooked for the first two Tests. Was the unfortunate bowler for the Khawaja drop and Carey Snicko shocker. Should get another go in Melbourne.\n\nJake Weatherald - 2 - Quiet game after a promising start to his Test career. Would be a potential Australian weakness for England to exploit had the Ashes not already been lost.\n\nTravis Head – 8 – Any flicker of hope England might have had was snuffed out by a century from South Australia's favourite son in the second innings. Head's promotion to open the batting is a defining moment in the outcome of the series.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne – 5 – No real contribution with the bat, but gets an extra mark apiece for two sensational catches at second slip. Still a nagging doubt he has a big score in him before the end of the series.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 7 – Took his chance after Steve Smith's illness, albeit via a life from Harry Brook. Should keep his place for Sydney.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Could not produce a performance to match his huge Indian Premier League pricetag and batting two places too high. Took the important wicket of Brook in the first innings.\n\nAlex Carey – 8 – Challenging Mitchell Starc as player of the series. Loses a point because he should have been given out in the first innings.\n\nJosh Inglis – 4 – An important 32 when England sensed momentum on the first day, but hasn't fully taken his chance. Could be squeezed out when Smith returns.\n\nPat Cummins – 7 – How has this man not bowled since July? Immediately into the groove with relentless accuracy. Once again an Ashes-winning captain.\n\nMitchell Starc – 6 – Not touching the heights of the first two Tests, though bowled with high pace in the first innings and took the key wickets of Jamie Smith and Will Jacks on the final day.\n\nNathan Lyon – 6 – Broke England's resistance with a triple-wicket burst on the fourth evening, only to hobble off with a hamstring injury on the final day. Could be out for the series.\n\nScott Boland – 6 – Unsung hero of Australia's attack, keeping up the pressure when the superstars rest. Will be in the conversation to rest in Melbourne, the venue where he destroyed England four years ago.",

I can enjoy, have a great time and try and get better every day.\n\n“It’s obviously a dream to do every single training out there and score some goals.”\n\nIn recent weeks, United have shown glimpses of their enormous potential in attack, scoring four goals in back-to-back games.\n\nDespite this, it was evident from the performance that the team could have scored a lot more if they had taken all their chances.\n\nHowever, the biggest conundrum for the head coach to solve is at the back, with the 20-time English league champions boasting of the worst defensive record among the top-12 sides in the division.\n\n“We know this is a great team, we are preparing with full power that we can use. Try to use it in certain situations, on the weak spots [of Aston Villa].\n\n“I think the guys are ready, we are looking forward to Sunday, trying to give our best and win the game.\n\n“[The message from Ruben has been] obviously to try and finish attacks because we had plenty of shots [against Bournemouth], try to be more clinical and in the defence just to have more focus.\n\n“As he says always, when we have a focus, it’s hard to beat us. We showed [that] many times, that’s the main focus for this weekend, to try and protect the net as long as possible.”\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Amorim sets his team up defensively, and the personnel he picks to offset the departure of his AFCON-bound stars.\n\nFeature image Gareth Copley via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Manchester City picked up a comfortable 3-nil win over West Ham at the Etihad Stadium yesterday to maintain the pressure on Premier League leaders Arsenal. A brace from Erling Haaland and a first-half goal from Tijjani Reijnders were enough to see City pick up a valuable three points. Pep Guardiola’s side barely had to get out of second gear yesterday against a struggling West Ham side. They made it seven consecutive wins in all competitions with their victory yesterday. But while City are racking up the wins, Pep Guardiola threw down a challenge to his players after their win yesterday. He believes that his team needs to go up a level to contend for silverware this season.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 3-nil win over West Ham, Pep Guardiola said he wants to see more from his team. He specifically spoke on their play in possession as an area that needs to improve. The Manchester City manager explained: “We are happy to win but the way we are with the ball, we have to improve otherwise it will not be enough to be title contenders in March, April and May.”\n\n“Always I have to thank Erling for the goals but today thanks to him, Phil and Nico O’Reilly, they help us a lot to do this game.”\n\n“Defensively we are improving and we can visualise it but with the ball, we are away from what we have to do. We are not close. The way we attack depends on how the opponents defend, we have to be in the right spots to make it more fluid and we were not.”\n\n“We are happy, we cannot deny we are in the Champions League spots, the semi-final of the Carabao Cup and up there in the Premier League.”\n\nA more telling quote from Pep Guardiola came when he urged his team to follow him and continue to improve. He added: “We will be there. If they follow me, we will be there, but we have to improve.”\n\n“I know the level but it’s not enough. The spirit, the aggression, the hunger is there. All the attributes they need that is not highlights. Many things, we have to do better.”\n\nEven though Manchester City have won seven consecutive matches in all competitions, Pep Guardiola’s assessment is on the money. There are obvious areas where this City team can improve. They were on display early in the second half of yesterday’s match. Manchester City struggled to play out from the back at the beginning of the second half. One misplaced pass from Bernardo Silva almost gifted West Ham a way back into the game. That is one clear area of City’s play that needs to improve. Manchester City have struggled at times this season to play out from the back, and that is a major area in which City can improve.\n\nThere are of course others. Pep Guardiola’s side is yet to establish the control of matches that they typically have and have built their play around. They were better in this regard yesterday but this portion of their play remains a work in progress. The major positive is that City are well placed to launch into the second half of this season despite having so many areas of their play which can improve. That is a major positive to take from Manchester City’s strong recent run of results.\n\nPep Guardiola has laid down the gauntlet to his team. He wants to see them to continue to improve so they can contend for silverware this season. Manchester City are entering a phase of the season where they have typically launched into title winning campaigns. But this is a new-look City team that needs to improve to match what their predecessors were able to do so often in the past. If this City team can follow suit anything is possible for Pep Guardiola’s side this season.",

    "description": "Running a private registry is easy; making it searchable isn't. Here's how reg taps SQLite to expose fast queries without touching S3.",
    "fullText": "Docker registries like docker.io and quay.io are public endpoints for browsing and fetching OCI images. You can also run a private registry yourself! The registry API is standardized here and the most ubiquitous open-source implementation is available here. Registries can work with myriad data stores, but in practice, they all just run on a comfy and reliable S3-compatible object store. It's cheap, it's persistent, it scales to infinity (if you're willing to renegotiate the \"it's cheap\" claim), but there's one major flaw. Querying arbitrary information about the stored images (e.g. \"list all image repositories in this registry, please\") is either:\n\nWouldn't the world be a tad more beautiful if there was a registry you can actually query? Let's implement one!\n\nThe OCI distribution specification is based on HTTP. It lists all endpoints that a conformant implementation must support, along with their legal methods and status codes for success and failure:\n\nThe REST paths are rather self-descriptive, modulo the cryptic \"referrers\" with an even more cryptic definition: \"a list of manifests with a subject relationship to a specified digest.\" Let's forget about these for now. The most important part is storing layers (a.k.a. blobs) and all kinds of metadata about images, their layers, versions, tags, etc. I described the OCI image format in more detail in this post.\n\nHow does the official implementation handle all the data management? It can be summed up as \"let's squeeze absolutely everything in S3.\" That applies both to data (OCI layers) and metadata (OCI manifests, tags, uploads, etc). It also makes the registry service extremely lightweight, as it doesn't keep any data itself. It really is barely more than syntactic sugar over the S3 API. The standard also specifies that it's fine to return an HTTP redirect response, which can be used to send presigned S3 requests. Then, users can fetch data from S3 directly. The storage layout is straightforward – data is kept in one prefix, metadata in another.\n\nSimple and brilliant, because everything is stored in a single place with high reliability guarantees. It's also what makes querying so bothersome: most interesting inquiries need to scan a huge S3 bucket. That's inefficient in two important ways: it’s slow and it’s expensive.\n\nWhat if we keep metadata somewhere else? Enter SQLite.\n\nThe OCI distribution format can be translated to a simple SQL schema. It can look roughly like this:\n\nPublishing an image boils down to uploading the layers to an object store and updating the metadata:\n\nKeeping information in SQLite is easy, because it's just a file. An OCI registry is a distributed system, though, so how can you store everything in a file and pretend it's scalable? A key observation is that we can store metadata in a \"write-through\" manner. Save everything in SQLite alright, but also store it in S3, just like the original implementation does. You can then treat SQLite as a fast-yet-powerfully-queryable cache.\n\nWhat if you lose the file or it becomes corrupt?\n\nFirst of all, since all the metadata is preserved in S3, the registry can scan the whole bucket and recreate the metadata structure in SQLite. That may take a few centuries for a large repository, but is only done sparingly – ideally once. The ability to bootstrap from an existing object store bucket also makes the registry a \"drop-in replacement™,\" as tech companies love to describe their products.\n\nNow that an SQLite-as-a-Service company (Turso) has entered the market, we can offload the complicated backup and replication bits to them, while still having a simple local file to manage. The embedded replicas feature looks relevant.\n\nAn SQLite database is a file, so if you're somehow not enticed by Turso (shame on you), other backup strategies exist. There’s \"just rsync with cron\" and Litestream, to name just two.\n\nWith all metadata kept locally, we can unleash SQLite's full potential and get all kinds of information from our new store.\n\nAll repositories in the registry, in JSON:\n\nRepositories with the most tags:\n\nLargest layers with matching image tags:\n\nList layers most frequently reused by multiple manifests:\n\nI'm a huge fan of concise naming, so this project is codenamed reg, and comes with obligatory low effort 3D ASCII art. Contributions are welcome!\n\nIt is still very much a work-in-progress, but it can already:\n\nIn other words, it's usable enough for local development.\n\nGive it a try! Especially if you also feel like reducing the number of missing features. You might have noticed the glaring --tls-verify=0 flag passed in every skopeo command due to reg's inability to speak HTTPS.",

    "title": "Quotes from Marcus Aurelius' Meditations Explained",
    "description": "Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations have made the Roman emperor equally respected as a Stoic philosopher. What do some of his most important quotes mean?",
    "fullText": "Published: Sep 25, 2025written by Tony Najjar, BA Philosophy (In-Progress), BA Earth & Life Sciences\n\nMarcus Aurelius’ Meditations is no ordinary philosophy treatise. Written by the 2nd-century CE Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the “Meditations” were not an organized text edited for publication, but a collection of the emperor’s philosophical thoughts and reflections as he sought clarity, resilience, and patience while ruling Rome’s mighty empire. They were only discovered and published centuries after his death. A follower of Stoic philosophy, his words have been embraced as practical lessons on how to achieve goals, overcome obstacles, and live a good life. Let’s look at five of the emperor’s most important quotes from the Meditations and the wisdom they contain.\n\n“Our actions may be impeded… but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” (Meditations 5.20)\n\nMarcus Aurelius frames obstacles and opportunities, suggesting that you should not get discouraged when you encounter a bump in the road. He suggests that obstacles can sometimes give us clarity on a better way to move forward, as they force us to keep digging. Obstacles can lead people to find inner strength and realize that they are capable of things they previously thought impossible. They also develop character in the face of setbacks, helping people become better human beings.\n\nThe author suggests that it is best to work with obstacles rather than resist and maintain a positive attitude when faced with difficulties. Instead of seeing obstacles as scary, they should be embraced as an opportunity to learn and grow. This is how you find the right path. If everything was easy, what’s the point of pursuing it anyway? It is the inner joy found while overcoming obstacles that contributes to a truly purposeful life.\n\n“To watch the course of the stars as if you revolved with them. To keep constantly in mind how the elements alter into one another. Thoughts like this wash off the mud of life below.” (Meditations 7.47)\n\nHere, Marcus Aurelius suggests that when you are feeling overwhelmed, it is a good idea to put your problems in perspective. He encourages individuals to imagine themselves running with the stars while appreciating the universe with astonishment, to realize that their problems are not as significant as they imagine. This exercise can help to reduce negative thoughts and encourage a sense of humility.\n\nThe Stoic Emperor also shares the reminder that change is the natural condition of the universe. He explains that nothing lasts forever; everything will transform and change. Remembering how seasons change, for example, or how the storm will sooner or later be replaced by the bright sun with its warm rays, is comforting. Anyone can benefit from keeping in mind that the adversity they are facing will end; change is inevitable.\n\n“If you seek tranquility, do less. Or (more accurately) do what’s essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way.\n\nWhich brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’\n\nBut we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow.” (Meditations 4.24)\n\nHere, Marcus Aurelius suggests that we can gain more tranquility in life by doing less, by not doing the things that are not essential. This minimalism not only reduces stress, but gives you the capacity to do the things that matter better, increasing the satisfaction in doing the things that matter.\n\nThis feels like a lesson for the modern world in which many people We are often made to feel guilty if we are not doing something productive all the time. This need to be busy means that we often fill our lives with things that are unnecessary. Marcus Aurelius suggests that this leads us to waste time on things that don’t matter, and reduce our ability to engage with the things that do.\n\nHis advice is to be careful how we spend our time, eliminating things that are unnecessary and prioritizing the things that truly matter to us. In this way, we are valuing our time and energy in the most beneficial way. But he suggests that this approach should not only extend to what we do, but also how we think. Don’t waste time on judging others when you could be focused on your own challenges.\n\n“To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it too, if you simply recognize that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.” (Meditations 7.22)\n\nThis passage emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and understanding. Marcus Aurelius suggests that we try to feel sympathy for people who have wronged others and understand what is behind their actions. For example, if you encounter someone who is incredibly rude, it may be that you are meeting them on the worst day of their life, and stress is causing their behavior. Therefore, try to be empathetic before passing judgment.\n\nMarcus Aurelius also talks about death in this passage. He is saying that both these people will die soon; so, what’s the point of getting angry or upset? Some people might see this as pessimistic, but Marcus Aurelius is highlighting that whatever you are upset about won’t matter for very long.\n\nThe Stoic emperor also suggests that while another person’s actions might feel hurtful, their actions don’t control how we choose to respond. The freedom and responsibility of our response lies with us. This is one of the most powerful teachings of the Stoics: we choose our thoughts and actions, and therefore create the world in which we live.\n\n“He does only what is his to do and considers constantly what the world has in store for him—doing his best and trusting that all is for the best. For we carry our fate with us—and it carries us.” (Meditations 3.4)\n\nHere, Marcus Aurelius talks about doing the tasks required of the person while staying curious and maintaining a positive attitude toward life. The individual is encouraged to care only about what will bring him to the achievement of his goals, one step at a time. He should not care about what others are doing unless people ask for his help.\n\nWhile the emperor suggests focused action, he also promotes curiosity. When you stay curious and constantly strive to discover the world, you will start to notice the opportunities.\n\nHe also suggests embracing a positive attitude and expecting good things to happen. Even when faced with adversity, remember that something good will come out of it in the end. He suggests that a wise person understands that everything happens for a reason.\n\nThe Meditations of Marcus Aurelius contain much more wisdom from Stoic philosophy. The Stoics believed in the importance of daily reflection and writing down philosophical teachings and principles to keep them in mind and live by them. This seems to have been Marcus Aurelius’s aim in writing his Meditations.",

    "title": "Tacit: We Know More Than We Can Tell",
    "description": "We know more than we can tell",
    "fullText": "In 1291, all glassmakers who lived in Venice were ordered to move to Murano, a cluster of seven tiny nearby islands. The exile was protective: it kept trade secrets contained and reduced the fire risk to the city’s wooden buildings. For five centuries, Murano’s workshops thrived. Then Napoleon conquered Venice in 1797 and dismantled the guild system. Within a generation, the industry had collapsed. Once that intergenerational chain was broken, the knowledge of how to create Murano glass could not be easily revived.\n\nThis kind of knowledge, what the philosopher Michael Polanyi called “tacit,” resists instruction. You can read about riding a bicycle, but you only truly learn by trying (and falling). You can follow a recipe for crème brûlée, but you only learn how the custard should settle—the particular wobble that means done, not the wobble that means wait—by overbaking a few. This is the kind of knowledge that is difficult to describe, easy to recognize, and nearly impossible to fake.\n\nThe mechanism for developing tacit knowledge is straightforward but slow: repeated practice that gradually moves skills from conscious effort to automatic execution. The mechanism for transmitting it is even slower: apprenticeship, where a learner works alongside someone experienced, observing and imitating until their own judgment develops. This is why tacit knowledge often concentrates in lineages, unbroken chains of practitioners passing expertise to the next generation.\n\nAI has elevated the distinction between what is tacit and what is not. Language models can summarize and automate, but when they attempt to create something that carries the signature of human craft, the result is often flat. Cedric Chin, a Singaporean analyst and one of the inspirations for this series, describes the process of acquiring tacit knowledge as the process of moving from conscious incompetence, to conscious competence, to, finally, unconscious competence.\n\nThe ceiling for LLMs, for now, seems to be conscious competence. They can capture and articulate procedure (or at least the median advice on any particular topic), but not judgment.\n\nAn illustrative example: I asked ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini each to design a fragrance that captures the scent of “jasmine just blooming on the vine on the west coast of California.” Each gave me a tidy list of top, middle, and bottom notes, with varying degrees of specificity and complexity. All featured Jasmine sambac absolute, the widely-accepted best substitute for jasmine on the vine, but none contained anything particularly surprising (I am not a perfumer, but I am a prolific Fragrantica user, and the LLM-generated fragrances all seemed suspiciously like perfumes I’ve smelled before).\n\nThis exercise seems abstract, but it’s paralleled by a real scene from the second episode of Tacit, which features Christophe Laudamiel, master perfumer at Osmo and the creator of fragrances from Polo Blue to Abercrombie Fierce.\n\nChristophe could explain what he was doing, and sometimes he did. But most of the time he just did it. Fingal Ferguson, the master knifemaker profiled in the first episode of Tacit, noted that muscle memory is a knifemaker’s tool of instinct. It’s a perfumer’s too, and with Christophe it showed up as a mostly-silent sequence. For hours we watched him smell, pause, and write, over and over again.\n\nWe made this series for two reasons.\n\nThe first is straightforward: nearly everything worth paying attention to was made by someone who cared deeply about their craft. Caring enough to pursue mastery over years is how tacit knowledge develops. We wanted to capture that care in action.\n\nThe second is that tacit knowledge is also economically foundational. For years Stripe Press has published books arguing that seemingly marginal improvements compound into the forces that determine whether societies become rich or stay poor. Most recently, The Origins of Efficiency showed that production improvements—the accumulated know-how of companies refining and scaling processes—is what made goods cheaper over time, which is the basic story of economic growth. Our next book, Maintenance: of Everything, makes the same case for the upkeep required to keep the complex systems that we depend on running.\n\nTacit knowledge and its accumulation (or, alternatively, deterioration) is another seemingly trivial but ultimately important determinant of economic outcomes. When tacit knowledge chains break, entire industries can collapse. The collapse of the British shipbuilding industry in the late 1950s, decline of the Swiss watchmaking industry in the 1970s (until its eventual revival a decade later), and the disappearance of Murano glass until the mid-19th century are all examples of this phenomenon.\n\nTacit, though, is our attempt to make a serious study of what tacit knowledge looks like at the individual level. It is a series of vignettes of people with deep, earned expertise, captured in the act of working. The things we can formalize—write down, measure, automate—turn out to be a surprisingly small subset of what we know how to do. The rest lives in trained judgment and practiced skill.\n\nThis kind of knowledge is difficult to capture on film. But we tried anyway. Our hope is that watching their mastery, even briefly, imperfectly rendered, helps you recognize your own.\n\nTamara Winter, Commissioning Editor, Stripe Press",

    "description": "Ants with lots of workers tend to put less energy into making them armored.",
    "fullText": "The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.\n\nTheir study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.\n\nIn the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.\n\n“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”\n\nEconomo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.\n\nTo test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.\n\nMicrotomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”\n\nTo solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.\n\nThe first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.\n\nThe team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.\n\nAnts that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.\n\n“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”\n\nThe researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.\n\nIn a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.\n\n“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.\n\nThe study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.\n\nBefore looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.\n\nScience Advances. 2025.

    "description": "The 6th Circuit, relying on the Supreme Court’s Loper Bright decision, ruled that the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order reclassifying broadband as a tele",
    "fullText": "Update as of January 2, 2025: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a decision on the consolidated petitions for review of the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order. In its January 2 decision, which relies heavily on principles articulated in Loper Bright, the court held that the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service misinterpreted the text of the Communications Act, and therefore the FCC's reclassification exceeded its statutory authority.\n\nInstead, the court held that in offering consumers the capability of retrieving information via telecommunications, ISPs offer an information service and that mobile broadband is not interconnected with the PTSN and is therefore a private mobile service not subject to common carrier regulation. Moreover, given its ruling, the court did not address whether the major questions doctrine also barred the FCC's reclassification. Finally, because the Open Internet Order was already stayed by the 6th Circuit last August, there is no immediate impact and, with the pending change in administration and FCC leadership in less than three weeks, it is unlikely the government will seek any further review through panel or en banc rehearing or certiorari to the Supreme Court, although certain of the intervenors supporting reclassification could.\n\nRead our latest advisory for more about the decision and key takeaways. The original advisory from June 6, 2024, appears below.\n\nOn May 7, 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued its latest network neutrality order, Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet (the \"Order\"), which was published in the Federal Register on May 22, 2024, making it mostly effective July 22, 2024. This massive document (more than 500 single-spaced pages in all) reinstates, with a few significant modifications, the network neutrality rules that the agency had previously imposed in 2015 (in the Open Internet Order), but which were set aside in 2017 (in the Restoring Internet Freedom, or RIF Order, and the Order on Remand, when the agency shifted from Democratic to Republican control following the 2016 election). Parties have asked the FCC to stay the Order and filed Petitions for Review challenging the Order in court.\n\nThe Order takes the following key steps (discussed in more detail below):\n\nIn broad strokes, the FCC's decisions in the Order – from the legal logic of the classification of BIAS as a telecommunications service, to the content of the new rules, to the exceptions from generally applicable telecommunications regulations – are the same as in the agency's 2015 Open Internet Order. We discuss the most important of those re-created rulings below. In addition, there are some interesting and potentially significant differences between this order and the 2015 Open Internet Order, which we also discuss below.\n\nAs noted above, the Order is extremely lengthy and detailed. We strongly recommend that BIAS providers and other interested parties carefully review the Order and consult with counsel about how the rulings in the Order may affect their decisions and operations going forward. With that caveat, however, set out below is a more in-depth discussion of the Order's key holdings.\n\nThe FCC first adopted a transparency rule in 2010, requiring BIAS providers to disclose accurate information about network management practices, network performance, and commercial terms (pricing, etc.). The FCC reaffirmed that rule in the 2015 Open Internet Order. In the 2017 RIF Order, the FCC modified the rule somewhat. The Order reinstates the 2015 rule.\n\nThe transparency rule requires BIAS providers to disclose information \"sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use of such services.\" The 2017 version, from the RIF Order, states that the information must be sufficient for \"entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings.\" The rule in the Order specifies that disclosures must be sufficient for \"content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.\"\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order eliminated the requirement that BIAS providers disclose information about packet loss on their networks, but the Order reinstates that obligation.\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order permitted providers to disclose network performance (such as actually achieved data rates) on a reasonably aggregated basis. The Order requires that reported performance must be geographically disaggregated so that a consumer in a given area can learn what to reasonably expect from a BIAS offering. Moreover, the Order requires disclosure of performance over a reasonable period of time and during times of peak usage so that consumers will know how the provider's network performs under conditions of maximum congestion. The Order does not, however, require disclosure of the source, location, timing, or duration of network congestion.\n\nThe obligations to report packet loss and geographically granular performance will not apply to BIAS providers with 100,000 or fewer customers.\n\nThe Order also requires that BIAS providers make their disclosures on the BIAS provider's website and not simply report them to the Commission (which was an option under the 2017 RIF Order). Moreover, the disclosures must be in machine-readable format, such as a .csv file, to facilitate consumers comparing the reported performance of different BIAS providers.\n\nFinally, the Order reinstates the requirement from the 2015 Open Internet Order that BIAS providers give consumers direct notice that their usage is about to trigger a change in performance level (e.g., a rate limitation after the consumer has used up their data allowance). As with packet loss and granular geographic reporting, this requirement does not apply to BIAS providers with 100,000 or fewer customers.\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order did not forbid blocking or throttling and so did not need to impose a carve-out for \"reasonable network management.\" The Order reinstates the no-blocking and no-throttling rules and so also reinstates the carve-out from those rules for \"reasonable network management.\" This exception will only apply to practices that have a \"primarily technical network management justification,\" rather than a justification based on \"other business practices.\" The no-blocking rule also prohibits BIAS providers from charging edge providers a fee to avoid having edge providers' content, services, or applications blocked from reaching BIAS providers' end-user customers.\n\nIf a technical justification exists, the FCC will assess whether a network management practice is reasonable based on the specific technology of a BIAS provider's network. Landline, mobile, and satellite BIAS providers will be able to adopt practices that make sense considering the constraints of their individual network technologies. The FCC specifically states that providers may implement practices needed for network security and that block traffic unwanted by end users (such as spam or malware) and does not prevent or restrict a BIAS provider from refusing to transmit unlawful material, such as child sexual abuse material or copyright-infringing materials. The FCC will consider (that is, view more leniently) practices for managing congestion that only apply during times of actual congestion. Congestion management practices should be \"as application-agnostic as possible.\"\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order purported to broadly preempt state-level regulation of broadband. However, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the FCC could not preempt state regulation when the theory of the RIF Order was that the FCC lacked regulatory authority over broadband in the first place.\n\nThe Order takes a different approach, stating that it will preempt \"any state or local measures that interfere or are incompatible with the federal regulatory framework we establish today.\" However, the FCC will undertake preemption on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the FCC notes that different states may legitimately impose different requirements regarding (for example) \"customer relationships and billing practices.\" In this regard, the FCC expressly declined to preempt California's \"Internet Consumer Protection and Network Neutrality Act of 2018\" on the ground that the law tracked the rules and requirements of the 2015 Open Internet Order that were set aside by the 2017 RIF Order and thus largely \"mirror or parallel\" the new Order's rules.\n\nThe Order's case-by-case approach to preemption could be problematic in that it may encourage states to impose potentially onerous regulations on BIAS providers under the rubric of consumer protection, in the hope that the regulations will either not be challenged or will survive a preemption attack at the FCC. It remains to be seen how this concern will play out in practice.\n\nEven while imposing net neutrality rules on BIAS providers – which, at a high level, boil down to fulfilling the basic common carrier obligations of nondiscrimination and reasonable conduct – the FCC did not want to impose most of the other, detailed obligations the Communications Act and the agency's own rules impose on telecommunications carriers. So, just as it did in the 2015 Open Internet Order, in the Order the FCC used its authority under Section 10 of the Act to \"forbear\" from applying a wide swath of those obligations.\n\nHere are the key regulatory obligations to which BIAS providers will not be subject under the Order (at least for now):\n\nWhile the FCC exempted BIAS providers from the provisions noted above, it determined that it would not forbear from applying certain other obligations of telecommunications carriers. The key obligations that will apply to BIAS providers are:\n\nIn addition to the specific statutory privacy obligations established by Section 222 of the Act governing the confidentiality of voice service-related \"customer proprietary network information\" (\"CPNI\"), the FCC has interpreted Section 222(a) and the general \"reasonableness\" requirement of Section 201(b) as establishing a general requirement for carriers to protect the confidentiality of customer information that does not fall under the definition of CPNI. Relying on these two statutory provisions, the agency recently promulgated detailed and potentially onerous data security and data breach reporting obligations on all traditional telecommunications carriers. The Order waives those specific rules, at least for now, for BIAS providers. In the meantime, providers have challenged the data security and data breach rules in the Sixth Circuit, arguing that Section 222 does not provide the FCC with authority to regulate customer privacy other than with respect to CPNI.\n\nOne reason for exempting BIAS providers from the new rules is that the agency did not have BIAS providers in mind when it formulated those rules. Beyond that, however, the agency seems to be pursuing some other goals as well.\n\nFirst, as noted above, for some time the agency has contended that Section 222(a) imposes a general obligation to protect customer information, separate and apart from the specific obligation on carriers to protect CPNI. The Order reasserts that view, which many industry participants dispute.\n\nSecond, the agency also contends that it has authority to impose privacy and data security obligations under the general \"just and reasonable\" standard in Section 201, which, again, many industry participants dispute.\n\nThird, in the wake of the 2015 Open Internet Order, in 2016 the agency separately issued an order (the \"2016 Privacy Order\") along with a set of detailed and onerous privacy rules specifically applicable to BIAS providers, relying on Sections 222(a) and 201(b) as authority. This action proved so controversial that Congress invoked the seldom-used Congressional Review Act (CRA) to invalidate those BIAS-specific privacy rules in 2017. Under the CRA, the invalidation of the old rules means that the agency may not adopt new rules that are \"substantially the same\" as the old ones without further authorization from Congress. By exempting BIAS providers from the agency's recently-adopted data security rules and leaving BIAS privacy issues to case-by-case adjudication under Section 201(b) and Section 222(a), and giving BIAS providers \"leeway in the details of how they go about complying with those obligations to a materially greater extent than the much more prescriptive 2016 rules,\" the Order attempts to protect this aspect of its holdings from CRA-based attacks. It remains to be seen whether this protection will prove sufficient on appeal.\n\nThe Order restores Section 224 pole attachment protections to BIAS-only providers, including both wireline and wireless providers, giving them the same rights as cable system operators and telecommunications service providers to non-discriminatory access to investor owned utility poles guaranteed by Section 224(f). In addition, ISPs attaching to such poles in 26 states where pole attachment rates, terms and conditions are regulated by the FCC may now avail themselves of FCC rules which, among other things, establish pole access timelines, limit pole attachment rates and allocation of pole-related costs, and establish procedures for resolving pole attachment disputes.\n\nMoreover, the classification will automatically apply in two \"reverse preemption\" states that have adopted FCC pole attachment rules outright (Pennsylvania and West Virginia) and in states that have limited preemption of the FCC's regulation to cable television system access. Notably, some of the remaining states that have reverse preempted the FCC already have extended their rules to cover broadband service providers. Other reverse preemption states may choose to amend their laws to ensure that their pole attachment rules cover BIAS providers.\n\nIn response to comments filed by the California Public Utility Commission, the FCC also declared that reclassification provides states with the requisite legal authority to protect public safety concerns associated with broadband-only infrastructure. While this may bolster a state's ability to extend existing regulations to broadband, a state's ability to do so will also depend on the specific state laws governing this area.\n\nSection 253 of the Act (for any telecommunications carrier) and Section 332 of the Act (for wireless carriers) protect against state or local governments taking actions that unduly interfere with the ability of a carrier to enter a market and offer its services, including, specifically, unreasonable or discriminatory restrictions on access to public rights-of-way for placing communications facilities. With reclassification, BIAS providers may now seek FCC or court intervention under those provisions when state or local regulations effectively prohibit the provision of BIAS services including by restricting competitive deployment.\n\nThe FCC concluded that reclassification of BIAS means that the agency's rules regarding the provision of telecommunications or cable services in MTEs (such as apartment and office buildings) now apply to BIAS-only providers. According to the FCC, it may now require BIAS-only providers to comply with the same requirements that apply to telecommunications and cable providers in MTEs, including rules that prohibit exclusive access and service contracts, as well as \"graduated revenue sharing\" where the landlord/owner receives greater compensation as the percentage of residents taking the service rises.\n\nBecause BIAS is now classified as a telecommunications service, BIAS services and equipment must be made accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with Part 6 of the FCC rules. As noted by the FCC, people who are deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, or have speech disabilities increasingly rely on IP-based video conferencing services to communicate. These services, like IP-based video relay service, require multiparty synchronous high definition video to accommodate sign language communication. Practically speaking, this means that BIAS providers may not adopt network management practices that have the effect of degrading the connections carrying video communications of persons with hearing and disabilities, such as blocking or throttling, bandwidth limits, data caps, or requirements to pay additional fees to obtain sufficient capacity. It also means that the means for accessing BIAS and any customer support for BIAS, including bills and technical support, must also be accessible to persons with disabilities.\n\nIn the 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC described the extension of its accessibility rules to BIAS as essentially already covered by its accessibility rules governing Advanced Communications Services (\"ACS\"). The current Order, however, acknowledges a distinction, stating clearly for first time that BIAS is not ACS. Notably, BIAS, like traditional telecom and interconnected VoIP services, is subject to a lower standard of achievement (\"readily achievable,\" i.e., accomplishable without much difficulty or expense) than applies to ACS (\"achievable,\" i.e., with reasonable effort or expense). However, video conferencing services that rely upon BIAS are a form of ACS, so this may be a distinction without a purpose.\n\nThe main policy justification for reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service in the 2015 Open Internet Order was that broadband providers had the incentive and ability to interfere with people's ability to access the online content they wanted. Expressly barring BIAS providers from such interference would protect the \"virtuous cycle\" of innovation by edge providers driving demand for broadband, leading to increased investment in broadband infrastructure.\n\nThe Order certainly mentions the importance of the \"virtuous cycle\" but does not emphasize it. Instead, the policy focus of the Order is that treating BIAS as a telecommunications service will allow the FCC to protect national security, promote cybersecurity, enhance public safety, monitor and enhance network resiliency and reliability, and protect consumer privacy and data security.\n\nThis shift in policy emphasis does not directly affect the agency's legal analysis underlying the Order's reclassification of broadband. At the same time, this shift is not merely cosmetic. Whatever may have been true a decade ago, today the Internet is so deeply embedded in the country's cultural, political, and economic life – and the international environment is so much more tense – that the risks of leaving this critical infrastructure unmonitored and unregulated are, from the agency's perspective, too great. The time since the Open Internet Order has seen a vast increase in remote work, remote learning, and remote healthcare – driven by the COVID-19 pandemic – all of which depend on a robust, resilient, reliable Internet. During that same time, the FCC has banned the use of certain Chinese equipment in United States telecommunications networks and barred certain Chinese entities from owning those networks. Classifying broadband as a telecommunications service is the most straightforward and direct way under existing law to bring broadband networks under federal supervision.\n\nThis shift in policy emphasis also constitutes a form of \"political insurance\" for reclassification if Republicans retake control of the agency following the 2024 election. The 2015 Open Internet Order was framed as an exercise of economic and consumer protection regulation, which made it an easy target for a deregulation-minded Republican-controlled FCC. But even if a new Republican majority in 2025 is skeptical of the need to regulate BIAS to protect consumers and encourage investment, promoting national security and protecting critical infrastructure against foreign adversaries – the focus of the Order – are likely to retain bipartisan appeal. The shift in policy emphasis in the Order may make it less likely that a future Commission would reverse the reclassification of broadband as a telecommunications service.\n\nEvery major court decision addressing an FCC ruling classifying broadband either as a telecommunications service or as an information service has expressly and heavily relied on the Chevron doctrine, under which courts defer to an agency's interpretation of its own statute if that interpretation is, broadly speaking, reasonable. The Supreme Court in Brand X relied on Chevron to uphold the FCC's then-current classification of cable broadband as an information service. The D.C. Circuit in USTA relied on Chevron to uphold the FCC's 2015 reclassification of broadband, in the Open Internet Order, as a telecommunications service. And the D.C. Circuit in Mozilla relied on Chevron to uphold (for the most part) the FCC's 2017 second reclassification of broadband, in the RIF Order, as (again) an information service.\n\nIf Chevron remains good law, courts may view the Order as reflecting a reasonable reading of the definitions in the Communications Act as applied to broadband – just as occurred with the 2015 Open Internet Order – and defer to the Commission's reclassification. But it is widely anticipated that the current Supreme Court, perhaps even this term, will cut back on the scope of Chevron. If that happens, reviewing courts may be less likely to defer and instead would have more leeway to determine not just whether the FCC's current interpretation of the Act is broadly reasonable, but also whether that interpretation represents the \"best\" or \"correct\" reading of the law. Anticipating this possibility, the Order takes great pains to explain why, in the agency's view, its reading of the law is not only reasonable but is, in fact, correct – an apparent effort to protect its reclassification decision against the possible demise of Chevron.\n\nIn this regard, while opponents of excessive regulation generally favor cutting back on Chevron, here a victory on that issue could be a double-edged sword. If Chevron is no longer good law, and if it turns out that the courts agree with the FCC that the Communications Act requires treating broadband as a telecommunications service, this would limit the ability of even a future conservative, deregulation-minded FCC to reclassify and deregulate broadband service.\n\nSince the time of the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order, the Supreme Court has, on several occasions, clarified and expanded the major question doctrine, which says that agencies are not permitted to interpret a broad, general grant of authority as including the power to decide \"major questions\" – that is, questions with \"vast economic and political significance.\" Under this doctrine, for an agency to address such questions requires express authorization from Congress. Some opponents of classifying broadband as a telecommunications service argued before the FCC that this would constitute action on a \"major question,\" which, they argue, is a step the agency may not take because Congress has not expressly authorized it.\n\nThe Order rejects that claim, for several reasons. It argues that the major question doctrine does not apply to this decision at all, since regulating communications networks is the agency's core function. It notes that Congress has not provided any guidance on the question of classification of Internet access (both broadband and dial-up) even though the agency has addressed the issue in a range of contexts since at least 1998; according to the Order, this indicates that Congress is content to leave the issue to the agency's discretion. And the agency argues that treating broadband as a telecommunications service simply does not have the \"vast economic and political significance\" required to bring the major question doctrine into play.\n\nGiven the Supreme Court's expansion of the major question doctrine in recent years, it is highly likely that parties opposing the Order will raise this issue as part of their challenges in court.\n\nDWT's communications and privacy and security groups are familiar with all aspects of the new net neutrality regime. Readers should feel free to reach out to us with any questions about how the new rules will apply to or affect BIAS provider operations going forward.",

    "description": "A study shows that young people who use tanning beds have more skin mutations including cells known to lead to skin cancer.",
    "fullText": "Research reveals that artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation cause cellular mutations that can be the seeds of future cancers, including highly deadly melanoma.\n\nTanning bed users are known to have a higher risk of skin cancer, but for the first time researchers have found that young indoor tanners undergo genetic changes that can lead to more mutations in their skin cells than people twice their age.\n\nThe study, which was led by UC San Francisco and Northwestern University, appears Dec. 12 in Science Advances.\n\n“We found that tanning bed users in their 30s and 40s had even more mutations than people in the general population who were in their 70s and 80s,” said Bishal Tandukar, PhD, a UCSF postdoctoral scholar in Dermatology who is the co-first author of the study. “In other words, the skin of tanning bed users appeared decades older at the genetic level.”\n\nSuch mutations can lead to skin cancer, which is the most common cancer in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. Among those skin cancers is melanoma, which accounts for only about 1% of skin cancers but causes most of the deaths. About 11,000 Americans die annually from melanoma, primarily from exposure to ultraviolet radiation.\n\nUV radiation occurs naturally in sunlight, as well as in artificial light sources like tanning beds. Rates of melanoma have risen along with the use of tanning beds in recent years, disproportionately affecting young women, who are the main clients of the tanning industry.\n\nNumerous countries effectively ban tanning beds, and the World Health Organization classifies them as a group 1 carcinogen, the same category as tobacco smoke and asbestos, but tanning beds remain legal and popular in the U.S.\n\nIn their study, the authors looked at the medical records of more than 32,000 dermatology patients including their tanning bed usage, history of sunburn, and family history of melanoma. They also obtained skin samples from 26 donors and sequenced 182 cells.\n\nThe young tanning bed users had more skin mutations than people twice their age, especially in their lower backs, an area that does not get much damage from sunlight but has a great deal of exposure from tanning beds.\n\n“The skin of tanning bed users was riddled with the seeds of cancer — cells with mutations known to lead to melanoma,” said senior author A. Hunter Shain, PhD, associate professor in the UCSF Department of Dermatology.\n\n“We cannot reverse a mutation once it occurs, so it is essential to limit how many mutations accumulate in the first place,” said Shain, whose laboratory focuses on the biology of skin cancer. “One of the simplest ways to do that is to avoid exposure to artificial UV radiation.”\n\nAuthors: From UCSF, authors include Delahny Deivendran; Limin Chen, PhD; Jessica Tang, PhD; Tuyet Tan; Harsh Sharma, PhD; Aravind K. Bandari, PhD; Noel Cruz-Pacheco, MS; Darwin Chang; Annika L. Marty, MS; Adam Olshen, PhD; Natalia Faraj Murad, PhD; and Iwei Yeh, MD, PhD. Co-first author Pedram Gerami, MD, is with Northwestern University, Chicago.\n\nFunding: The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (R01 CA265786); the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (AR080626); the Department of Defense Melanoma Research Program (ME210014); and the Melanoma Research Alliance.

    "fullText": "Third Ashes Test, Adelaide Oval (day five of five)\n\nAustralia 371: Carey 106; Archer 5-53 & 349: Head 170; Tongue 4-70\n\nEngland 286: Stokes 83; Boland 3-45 & 352: Crawley 85; Cummins 3-48\n\nAustralia won by 82 runs, lead five-match series 3-0\n\nEngland's Bazball project is in tatters as yet another Ashes in Australia was lost in three Tests.\n\nThe tourists were defeated by 82 runs on the fifth day of the third Test in Adelaide to go 3-0 down and extend a winless run in this country to 18 matches.\n\nAustralia were delayed by a 40-minute rain shower, England pair Jamie Smith and Will Jacks, and a hamstring injury to spinner Nathan Lyon.\n\nSmith had 60 when he miscued Mitchell Starc. Jacks battled past lunch for his 47 then edged the same bowler to first slip, where Marnus Labuschagne again took a breathtaking catch.\n\nWhen Josh Tongue edged Scott Boland to Labuschagne, England were all out for 352 and their misery in this country prolonged to 14 years and counting.\n\nThis was supposed to be England's opportunity to finally compete in Australia, the most highly-anticipated Ashes in recent memory.\n\nInstead it has turned into the worst tour in recent times, leaving the futures of captain Ben Stokes, head coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key in doubt.\n\nEngland have surrendered the chance to win the Ashes in only 11 days of cricket and now must find a result in either Melbourne or Sydney to avoid the ultimate humiliation of a 5-0 clean sweep.\n\nThis is the fourth successive Ashes tour in which England have lost the first three Tests. By the time Australia visit the UK in 2027, it will be 12 years since England's previous Ashes win.\n\nWho is in charge of England by then will come in for intense debate. Stokes and McCullum have contracts until the end of that series. In theory, Key has most sway over the fate of both men, but is probably under more pressure than either.\n\nThis is a stunning win for the Australians, who began the series with questions over selection and the age of their squad.\n\nCaptain Pat Cummins missed the first two Tests, Josh Hazlewood is out for the entire series, Lyon was omitted for the second Test and Steve Smith is absent in Adelaide.\n\nAustralia have still been far too good for England, as they have been on home turf since 2011.\n\n'I put my hands up' - McCullum admits Ashes mistakes\n\n'Test career over for now?' - Ashes player ratings\n\nThe 10 moments that decided the Ashes\n\nStokes said this tour was the chance for his England team to \"create history\", while McCullum declared the Ashes could \"define\" the group.\n\nEngland will be defined as losers in this country, their history entwined with all the other Ashes tourists to be humbled down under.\n\nThe Bazball ideology has been exposed by Australia's hard-nosed, ruthless and relentless Test cricket. There was always suspicion, even derision, in this country of England's style of play, despite a 2-2 draw in the UK two years ago. Australia have been proved right.\n\nEngland's selection, preparation and method have all been found wanting. This tour will be remembered for showing disdain to warm-up matches, a holiday in Noosa and Stokes talking about \"weak men\" in his dressing room.\n\nArchitects of their own downfall in the first two Tests, England improved in Adelaide, yet still committed too many errors.\n\nThe tourists went into the game without a specialist spinner, dropped Usman Khawaja on the first morning, and Ollie Pope and Harry Brook were guilty of poor shots in the first and second innings respectively. In England's defence, they did get the wrong end of the Alex Carey Snicko controversy.\n\nThe 5-0 embarrassment looks unavoidable. Pope will surely be left out of the fourth Test in Melbourne, although England's only reserve batter is Jacob Bethell – a 22-year-old still to score a first-class hundred.\n\nShoaib Bashir was chosen to be England's first-choice spinner and looks unselectable. Matthew Potts and Matthew Fisher are the two seamers yet to play in this series, though neither would be in the squad if other bowlers were fit and available.\n\nAshes defeats in Australia usually mean sweeping changes to an England regime and the bloodletting will soon begin. Before then, things could get much worse on the field.\n\nAustralia were billed as ageing, ravaged by injuries and struggling to settle on an opening partnership.\n\nMight this series have turned out differently had Travis Head not been promoted to open in place of the injured Khawaja for the second innings of the first Test in Perth? Head's match-winning century was one of the great Ashes moments and gave Australia momentum they have not relinquished.\n\nStarc's bowling decimated England in the first two Tests – covering for Cummins and Hazlewood almost single-handedly. Carey is putting together one of the greatest exhibitions of glovework seen by a wicketkeeper in a single series.\n\nCummins was in danger of missing the series because of a back injury but hastened his rehabilitation to return in Adelaide. Despite not bowling a ball since July, the captain was outstanding.\n\nIn what will certainly be the last home Ashes for a number of these players, they will now set their sights on joining the three other Australia teams to have inflicted 5-0 annihilations of the English.\n\nAfter that comes the return series in the UK in the summer of 2027 and the final frontier of winning an away Ashes – something Australia have not achieved since 2001.\n\nInjured spinner Lyon a doubt for rest of Ashes\n\nEngland began the day on 207-6, 228 away from pulling off the highest successful chase in Test history. Admission prices were cut, though the Adelaide Oval was only one-third full.\n\nSmith swiped two sixes over the leg side before the rain break and there was concern when Jacks rolled his ankle setting off for a single.\n\nSmith continued to attack with crisp drives following the resumption, while Lyon left after making a diving stop on the fine-leg boundary and is now a doubt for the rest of the series.\n\nAustralia took the second new ball and Smith reached his first Ashes half-century by driving Cummins back over his head, only to attempt a shot too many at Starc. Cummins took a fine catch back-pedalling at mid-on to end a seventh-wicket stand of 91.\n\nJacks found a willing ally in Brydon Carse for a partnership of 52. Starc returned after lunch, Jacks edged and, for the second time in the match, Labuschagne swooped low to his left to claim a sensational one-handed grab.\n\nStarc had Jofra Archer cut to deep point, last-man Tongue poked at Boland and the Ashes were secure in Australian hands once more.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

He first brings up Trump by mentioning the strikes on the alleged Venezuelan drug boats.\n\n“There’s little evidence to support their actions,” he says in the video. “And pretending its all the fake drugs but really it’s a way to claiming a war against Venezuela so we can steal their oil.”\n\nHe also says the evidence of that is the full pardon of Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who helped funnel cocaine into the United States.\n\n“If you’re fighting drugs, I don’t know if you should be forgiving the guy who brought 10 flat beds of cocaine into the country,” Matthews said.\n\nMatthews also brings up Hilary Clinton, Israel’s actions against Gaza and Trump’s aggressive crackdown on immigration.\n\n“The attacks on immigrants and different populations seems pretty racist,” he said.\n\nHis final remark is on how Trump reacted after the murders of legendary director Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle Reiner.\n\n“What a disgusting human being Donald Trump is.

    "description": "Donovan Metayer was a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida when a gunman opened fire and",
    "fullText": "Donovan Metayer was a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida when a gunman opened fire and killed 17 people on Valentine’s Day 2018.\n\nA young man who was a “radiant” child according to family and friends, has died.\n\nDonovan Joshua Leigh Metayer, 26, died on Dec. 15 by suicide. Metayer, who survived the 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, suffered from mental health episodes following the tragic incident and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The shooting occurred during Metayer’s senior year, when most students are thinking about college applications and their life after high school.\n\nBut the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 people, had a profound effect on Metayer and stands as an example of how the trauma of gun violence can linger on for years.\n\nThe youngest child of the Metayer family, Donovan was brilliant from an early age and excelled academically. His humor, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated in his honor, could “light up any room.”\n\nIn the years following the Parkland shooting, Metayer’s dreams of attending college and working in his preferred career field of computer science began to fade. On multiple occasions, he would be hospitalized for suicidal ideation and after one mental health episode in 2021, he was Baker-acted and deemed temporarily unable to purchase a firearm.\n\nYears later, with the help of a private psychiatrist and the Henderson Clinic Metayer began making progress and healing. He’d soon work at Office Depot and earn a promotion and an IT certificate. His mental health journey echoes that of many Black boys across America, masking emotions and not wanting to be seen as a “burden” by family. Treatment, from therapy to medication, may seem like a difficult path thanks to limited resources, social stigmas and more.\n\nHowever, just as Metayer was progressing and gaining more independence according to his family, he soon learned his Risk Protective Order had lapsed.\n\nMetayer then purchased a gun from a gun shop in the area and within a week, he turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn a statement shared on his GoFundMe page, Donovan’s family wrote, ” Donny’s passing is a heartbreaking reminder of the mental health crisis plaguing our youth and the lasting trauma of gun violence on our community. As we grieve his loss, we are breaking the code of silence in his memory. Though Donny’s life was brief, his impact will be everlasting.”\n\nThe family is asking for funds to assist for Metayer’s celebration of life and endow a fund at the Henerson Clinic that will “provide healthcare, housing and hope for people of all ages with behavioral health conditions” throughout the state of Florida.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.\n\n‘They beat our brother’: New York community demands justice after video shows police beating a Black man\n\nRay J has restraining order extended following November arrest, faces 6 misdemeanor charges: ‘I’m missing my kids’\n\nDeaths of Missisippi mom Shardee McGill and 3-year-old daughter determined to be murder-suicide",

Still, parents take their kids to meet him, the kids either cry hysterically, or get their pictures taken and gift choices noted before moving on.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nFor about 80 years, for people living in San Francisco, that tradition meant taking their children to Macy's Union Square. It was a time-honored tradition that has lasted for generations, but this year, it won't be happening.\n\nSanta Claus, at least for San Franciscans who enjoy visiting him at Macy's Union Square, won't be coming to town, it seems.\n\nMacy's has quietly ended its tradition of having Santa Claus head from its Thanksgiving Day Parade to its store in Union Square, San Francisco.\n\nThe chain explained that decision in a way that suggests it did not have the option of hiring multiple Santas to visit different stores.\n\n“This year, Macy’s Santa will not be available at our Union Square location. Instead, he will be going on a national tour to visit stores and communities he hasn’t had a chance to appear in before, following his national arrival at the (New York) Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade,” Macy’s officials said in a statement reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nMacy's added that the holiday season magic will continue in Union Square with its SF SPCA Holiday Windows and Macy's Great Tree presented by Ripple.\n\n\"It seems weird without Santa Claus,\" Yvonne Fletcher and her husband, Adrian, told Yahoo News. \"I can't bring my grandkids, and that's what we were waiting for.\"\n\nAbout an 80-year tradition: Santa appeared annually at Macy’s Union Square store, dating back to the store’s opening in the late 1940s and continuing nearly every year until 2025 (excluding the pandemic year), according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nLocal cultural touchstone: Families lined up for visits and photos with Santa each holiday season, making it a cherished Bay Area tradition, the San Francisco Chronicle added.\n\nSame Santa for decades: From roughly 1990 to 2010, the role was played by the beloved “Santa John,” whose appearance became iconic in local family photos, reported Hoodline.\n\nNo Santa in 2025: For the first time in nearly 80 years, Macy’s confirmed Santa won’t be at Union Square this holiday season as he embarks on a national tour after the Thanksgiving parade, shared ABC7 San Francisco.",

    "fullText": "There will be no Cinderella story for Tulane in this year’s College Football Playoff.\n\nFormer BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff and the Green Wave fell 41-10 to the Ole Miss Rebels Saturday in the CFP’s first round, bringing an end to Retzlaff’s eventful but accomplished college career.\n\nRetzlaff completed 20 of 35 passes for 306 yards against the Rebels with a late touchdown pass and a first quarter interception.\n\nTypically a strong running threat, having run for 610 yards and 16 touchdowns this season prior to Saturday, Retzlaff was held to 24 yards on 11 carries by Ole Miss, being sacked twice.\n\nIn 31 career starts at BYU and Tulane, Retzlaff posted a 22-9 record with 6,763 passing yards and 63 total touchdowns.\n\nHe began his college journey at the junior college level before landing in Provo ahead of the 2023 campaign. Retzlaff took over as BYU’s starter for the final four games of the season following an injury to Kedon Slovis, famously becoming the first Jewish starting quarterback in school history.\n\nThough Retzlaff went 0-4 to finish 2023, he won the starting QB job over transfer Gerry Bohanon in 2024 and piloted the Cougars to a 11-2 mark to tie for first place in the Big 12 Conference and capture an Alamo Bowl victory over Colorado.\n\nRetzlaff was expected to start for BYU again in 2025, but a civil lawsuit filed this past May accusing him of sexual assault and battery resulted in his withdrawal from the school and eventual enrollment at Tulane. The case was ultimately dismissed in June.\n\nDespite joining the Green Wave just weeks before the start of fall camp, Retzlaff won the team’s starting quarterback job and powered Tulane to a 10-2 regular season and American Conference championship game win over North Texas, clinching the program’s first-ever CFP appearance.\n\nEarlier this week, ESPN wrote Retzlaff could be selected as high as the sixth round of April’s NFL draft.",

    "description": "After the dominant win in Oxford, Ole Miss will play one of the best teams in college football.",
    "fullText": "Who will Ole Miss play next? Explaining the 2025 CFP bracket opponent for Round 2 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe No. 6 Ole Miss Rebels have emphatically answered the question of whether they can win without Lane Kiffin. In their first game since Kiffin left for LSU, and the biggest game in program history, the Rebels delivered a dominant performance at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, crushing the No. 11 Tulane Green Wave 41-10, to advance in the College Football Playoff. New head coach Pete Golding is now 1-0 in his debut, proving the 12-1 Rebels are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe victory showcased the Rebels' strength and determination despite the unusual mid-playoff coaching change. While Tulane allowed Jon Sumrall, the next head coach at Florida, to coach his final contest for the Green Wave, Ole Miss proved that its players were singularly focused on the championship path.\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that Ole Miss's reward for the decisive win is an immediate clash with one of the best coaches and teams in college football. That team is the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs, led by two-time national champion head coach Kirby Smart. Georgia once again steamrolled the competition, finishing the season 12-1 and defeating Alabama to claim its fourth SEC championship under Smart. Entering the playoff, Smart owns a career record of 117-20, cementing Georgia as the preeminent power in the sport.\n\nThe Rebels will now travel to New Orleans to face Georgia in the Sugar Bowl quarterfinal on New Year’s Day. The game is a highly anticipated rematch of their regular-season contest on October 18, which Georgia won 43-35 after rattling off 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to hand Ole Miss its only loss of the season. The Bulldogs will be looking to rewrite the script from last season, when they were eliminated in the Sugar Bowl by Notre Dame.\n\nHere’s more on the highly anticipated SEC rematch between Ole Miss and Georgia.\n\nSN AWARDS: 2025 All-America team | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff first round predictions\n\nOle Miss will face No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as one of, if not the, best programs in college football over the past five seasons. The Bulldogs won back-to-back championships in 2021 and 2022, securing the program's first national titles since 1980. This sustained period of dominance has seen them compile an FBS-best record of 64-6 since the start of the 2021 season, making them a perennial force in the playoff conversation.\n\nIn addition to the national titles, the Bulldogs have collected three of the last four SEC Championships, winning in 2022, 2024, and 2025, most recently a dominating 28-7 victory over No. 9 Alabama. The Crimson Tide were the one team that beat the Bulldogs this season, defeating them in September. But, Georgia was dominant in all three phases en route to another conference title in Atlanta.\n\nThis year's Georgia team is as talented as any in the country. On offense, Gunner Stockton is surrounded by talented skill position players, whether Zachariah Branch, Dillon Bell, Nate Frazier, Chauncey Bowens, Oscar Delp and more. On defense, the Bulldogs did not look like a typical Kirby Smart defense — especially when rushing the passer — early in the season, but have now gone four games allowing 10 or less points. There is an argument that though Georgia is No. 3, the best team in America lies in Athens.\n\nMORE: Georgia 2025 College Football Playoff tickets guide\n\nGeorgia and Ole Miss already squared off this year, with the Bulldogs winning 43-35 in Athens. Georgia, who is known for its dominance in the final frame, rattled off 17 fourth quarter points to give the Rebels their first and only loss.\n\nAn unparalleled run of success — two national championships, three SEC titles in four years, and nearly three calendar years without a regular-season loss — firmly establishes Georgia as the premier program in the modern era, setting the standard for every other team entering the newly expanded College Football Playoff.\n\nWith a head coach only in his second game in charge, the Rebels will face off against a program that everyone strives to be on New Years day.

    "fullText": "Josh Johnson is the Ryan Fitzpatrick of Josh McCowns. By which, I mean, he's a king among journeymen.\n\nHis action in service of an injured Marcus Mariota in Week 16 marked his first pass as a member of the Washington football team since 2018, but no one knows him as simply a Commanders backup. His career has spanned 18 seasons, nine NFL starts and four professional football leagues. He's spent time with 14 different NFL franchises -- a number that puts him above all other journeymen and makes him an immaculate grid cheat code. So who has he played for in his pro career?\n\nOh, friends, buckle up, because we're about to take a tour through a bunch of practice squads and failed spring football leagues before landing back with the Commanders this winter. In chronological order, Johnson has played for the:\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (2008–2011, five starts, 0-5 as a starter)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (2012, practice squad/offseason only)\n\nSacramento Mountain Lions (2012, United Football League)\n\nCincinnati Bengals (2015, practice squad/offseason only)\n\nNew York Jets (2015, practice squad/offseason only)\n\nBaltimore Ravens (2016, practice squad/offseason only)\n\nOakland Raiders (2018, practice squad/offseason only)\n\nSan Diego Fleet (2018, Alliance of American Football, did not play in the regular season)\n\nWashington (2018, three starts, 1-2 as a starter)\n\nLos Angeles Wildcats (2020, XFL)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (2020, practice squad/offseason only)\n\nBaltimore Ravens (2021, one start, 0-1 as a starter)\n\nThat's a lot of practice and a bunch of paychecks for an average of 19.9 NFL passes per season. In this house, we respect our NFL journeyman king.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: How many teams has Josh Johnson played for?",

    "description": "Connor Ingram faces Vegas Sunday, and the Oilers' lack of attention to detail and defensive lapses against the Wild offer little confidence for his starting debut.",
    "fullText": "Calvin Pickard played well against the Minnesota Wild, but gave up four goals. That's not a positive sign for Connor Ingram, who will get the start on Sunday as the Edmonton Oilers head home to take on the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nThe Oilers had their chances offensively, but will have to play much better defensively to give Ingram some confidence as he tries to prove he's still got game left in the NHL. Because his AHL numbers have not been good, he'll need all the help he can get.\n\nEdmonton's attention to detail on Saturday isn't going to cut it with a huge question mark between the pipes. In November (see video above), I discussed the likelihood that the Oilers would give Ingram a look and whether there was a clear path to the NHL for him. I was partially right, but my timing was off.\n\nAt that time, Edmonton was still figuring out the situation with Stuart Skinner and Pickard. I assumed the Oilers would make an external change before going to Ingram. They did. Unfortunately, no one expected the change they made to be out of the lineup with an injury in his third start.\n\nNow, Ingram is the guy, ready or not. The Oilers have no choice but to find out.\n\nOilers Provide Several Injury Updates: Pickard Starts vs. Wild\n\nOilers Beat Bruins, But Potentially Lose Jarry In The Process\n\nDespite a .889 save percentage, Pickard wasn’t the problem Saturday afternoon. If anything, he was the reason the game stayed competitive as long as it did. The real issues sat higher up the food chain — in how the Oilers managed the game, handled pressure, and responded when a dagger goal at the end of the first period changed the energy level.\n\nThe Oilers weren’t outplayed for long stretches. In fact, there were plenty of opportunities in the third period to even the game. After clawing back in the first, they pushed, created chances, and tried again late in the game. It wasn't enough, as Filip Gustavsson was great for the Wild, and when the opportunity arose, Minnesota capitalized on Edmonton's mistakes.\n\nUnfortunately, the Oilers can't afford to make those mistakes when Ingram takes the net on Sunday.\n\nReport: Oilers Had Interest In Sabres Goalie Before Jarry Trade The Oilers reportedly had another goalie on their radar before they acquired Tristan Jarry from the Penguins.\n\nHe'll be up against Carter Hart -- Vegas' backup -- so both netminders have a lot to prove. It will be a storyline of two goalies, many of whom will wonder how much is left in the tank. To make life easier for Ingram, the Oilers need to help him get settled. An early lead and nearly mistake-free hockey will be key -- almost the opposite storyline from Saturday's matinee game.\n\nThis game came down to the smaller details.\n\nLeon Draisaitl got frustrated after a soft cross-checking call. On the ensuing two penalties, the Wild's Matt Boldy made one of those minors count. Later in the game, Evan Bouchard stuttered when he thought a penalty should have been called and an offside was missed. Finally, when Edmonton thought they were close on the game-tying goal in a scrum in front of Gustavsson, the Wild turned, went the other way, and scored.\n\nMistakes happened, and Minnesota struck when they did. The Oilers' awareness slipped at exactly the wrong time.\n\nThe late breakdowns will be a problem if Ingram isn't up to snuff. And, there's absolutely no way to know if he will be until he takes the goal and faces a few shots.\n\nThat’s where the bigger questions start to form. How confident can the Oilers possibly be in a goalie who has bad numbers in the minors and hasn't shown anything of note since the 2023-24 season?\n\nThere is no update on Tristan Jarry's status. A long-term injury leaves Edmonton in a very tricky situation -- one where they'll need to decide whether making a play for someone like Alex Lyon is the right move and whether they can pull it off, with the Buffalo Sabres well aware they have all the leverage.\n\nThe road trip was still productive, that's the good news. Despite the setbacks, the Oilers aren’t broken. But games like this linger because there are too many unanswered questions, Ingram being the biggest of them.\n\nThe Oilers will need to play a more mature game against the Golden Knights. It should be \n\nFrom there, the Oilers can only hope the news on Jarry isn't terrible.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "fullText": "Jaden McDaniels is impressed by Anthony Edwards' superstar moments against the Thunder originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA community had its eyes on the blockbuster game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. It was a rematch from the 2025 Western Conference Finals, and it felt like a true postseason matchup.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander once again stood out for the defending champions, but it was Anthony Edwards who took home the victory and everyone's attention. Edwards came up with plenty of big moments, especially during crunch time.\n\nAs two players who entered the league at the same time in 2020, Edwards and Jaden McDaniels are extremely close. They have been working together for a while, so they are not surprised when one of them plays well.\n\nIn fact, they are the biggest fans of each other's game, as both Edwards and McDaniels go out of their way to praise the other. Edwards has always been a firm believer that McDaniels is much more than just a lockdown defender, and McDaniels always knows that Edwards is a superstar-level player.\n\nMore: Timberwolves' Chris Finch nearly lost his mind after ejection\n\nA day after the big win against the Thunder, McDaniels was interviewed after practice. He made sure to address what Edwards did in the last 90 seconds of the win against the Thunder. That involved big defensive plays and a huge shot to finish with 26 points and 12 rebounds.\n\n\"I’m super impressed. I know he’s willing and wants the big moments and the big shots. It’s not our first time we’ve seen him make a shot like that and then defense, it’s the same stuff, I see him fly to the rim chasedown block vs Indiana like when he jumped over my head, then he did the same thing last night,\" McDaniels said to Zone Coverage's Andrew Dukowitz after practice.\n\nThe Timberwolves are having a decent season, but they are capable of doing much more. They were in the past two Western Conference Finals, so they want to exceed that and succeed.\n\nWith this win over the Thunder, it could be the confidence booster they have needed. Considering head coach Chris Finch got himself ejected against the Thunder, it just shows that this team is passionate about succeeding in a conference dominated by OKC.",

He stayed down on one knee after a play and was clearly shaken-up.\n\nIf Mariota can't return, veteran quarterback Josh Johnson will take the reins of the offense.

The team has not confirmed that, though.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota is now out of the locker room and back on the sideline, but he still has his right hand wrapped and hasn't grabbed his helmet. Not a good sign for his chances of returning.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota was evaluated for a concussion, but was cleared. However, the Commanders also revealed he is dealing with a right hand injury and is now questionable to return.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota is now heading to the locker room, according to Nicki Jhabvala of The Athletic. That is a bad sign for his chances of returning to the game.\n\nESPN's John Keim adds that Mariota had his throwing hand wrapped in a towel, so that appears to be his injury.\n\nStill no update from the team, though.\n\nMariota is headed to the medical tent to get checked out.

    "fullText": "Cristian Romero would not have been sent off in Tottenham's 2-1 Premier League loss to Liverpool if referee John Brooks \"did his job\" properly, says Spurs manager Thomas Frank.\n\nTottenham were reduced to 10 men in the first half after a VAR intervention when Xavi Simons was dismissed for a foul on Virgil van Dijk.\n\nHowever, the hosts fought back and reduced the deficit late on through substitute Richarlison.\n\nDespite being a man down, Tottenham were well on top in stoppage time and chasing an equaliser when their captain Romero received a second yellow card for a petulant kick out at Ibrahima Konate.\n\nRomero's first booking came for dissent in the aftermath of Liverpool's second goal, with the Argentine feeling Hugo Ekitike had pushed him in the back as he headed in.\n\n\"There is a massive mistake by John [Brooks] on the pitch. Two hands on the back by Ekitike,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I don't understand how he didn't see it. OK. Luckily we have VAR so they will bail you out when you need it, which they didn't. That was the second mistake.\n\n\"I think if you go back to that [second Liverpool goal] and the referee did his job, then I think it would not have been a first yellow [for Romero]. Is that fair to say?\n\n\"I have a player that is extremely passionate, and if you have a passionate player then you need to go to the line sometimes.\"\n\nIn a post on X, the Premier League match centre, said: \"The referee's call of goal for Liverpool was checked and confirmed by VAR - with it deemed there was normal contact for an aerial challenge between Ekitike and Romero.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given agreed on Match of the Day: \"I think John Brooks has got it right.\"\n\nSpurs can take a number of positives from fighting back with a numerical disadvantage against last term's champions, however the result leaves Frank's side 13th in the table.\n\nTottenham's 11 home league defeats in 2025 are also their most in a calendar year - and the fact five of those have come under the Dane, who took over from Ange Postecoglou in the summer, will place further scrutiny over his reign.\n\nLiverpool hold on for chaotic win at nine-man Spurs\n\nHowever, there are also likely to be question marks over Romero's suitability as the club's captain.\n\nThe Argentine, who was appointed as Tottenham skipper by Frank in the summer after the departure of Son Heung-min to Los Angeles FC, has a chequered disciplinary record.\n\nIn 114 Premier League appearances the former Atalanta defender has collected 34 yellow cards and three red cards.\n\nTottenham, alongside Bournemouth, have the most yellow cards in the top flight this season with 42 - and 21% of those (nine) can be attributed to Romero.\n\nHe was also one of the players to be given their marching orders when Spurs were last reduced to nine players in a league match, against Chelsea in 2023.\n\nAnd the context of his second yellow card against the Reds left former Tottenham and Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp bewildered.\n\n\"I think Hugo Ekitike's goal is a foul. I can't believe it's not given, A consequence of that is Cristian Romero runs after the referee and gets himself a yellow card which has an impact at the end of the game,\" Redknapp said on Sky Sports.\n\n\"What Romero did is what Romero does. To get involved right in front of the referee and kick out at someone right in front of the referee. If my four-year-old did that I would say 'what are you doing?'\n\n\"Konate leaves a bit on Romero first which is actually quite cute because he knows he is not going to get caught. But he [Romero] can't do that. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nAnd former Tottenham goalkeeper Joe Hart called some of Spurs' behaviour in the defeat \"wild\".\n\n\"They put up a really good fight but there was so much ill discipline,\" he told Match of the Day. \"You can't have that, you make it difficult for yourself.\n\n\"Xavi Simons has not gone out of his way to nail his fellow countryman but it is something so dangerous to do, absolutely a red card.\n\n\"They are fighting and scrapping for their lives, but from the moment Romero got that yellow card I felt another would come.\n\n\"Konate has just baited him and it is right in front of John Brooks - he has to give him a second yellow card.\n\n\"They just totally lost control. Richarlison after the game still not giving up, it all looked a bit wild out there.\"\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Simons apologised for his earlier attempted tackle on his Netherlands captain Van Dijk.\n\nHe wrote: \"Mistakes happen. Virg is my captain, I would never intentionally hurt him or anyone. To my Spurs team-mates, my manager and the fans, I take responsibility, I'm really sorry.\"\n\nWhile Frank conceded he had seen similar challenges to the one made by the attacking midfielder receive the same punishment, he suggested it was not worthy of a sending off.\n\n\"I don't like this [Simons' challenge] as a red card. I think the game is probably too big to say gone, but for me it's not reckless and it's not exceptional force,\" Frank added.\n\n\"He is chasing Van Dijk. He is trying to put pressure and then he changes direction. Unfortunately his foot is on Achilles.\n\n\"You can say 'ah, you need to be smarter, don't do it and all that' - but are we not allowed to have physical contact any more?\n\n\"The next thing on that is if he gets three games, which I don't understand, how can he get three games for something which is not reckless? That is absolutely wrong and we probably can't appeal it.\"\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "MONROE – Summerfield’s girls basketball team will take a perfect record into the Christmas break.\n\nThe Bulldogs rolled their record to 6-0 with a 51-41 win over Monroe on Saturday, Dec. 20.\n\n“We played a really good first half on defense and executed well on offense,” Summerfield coach Mickey Moody said. “In the second half we stopped rotating on defense and Monroe made us pay by knocking down 3s.”\n\nMakenzie Wolfe played what Moody called “her best game of the year” with 16 points.\n\nJaeli Jones added 11 points and Mayley Mannebach 10 for Summerfield.\n\n“I’m happy with the start of season and we know that we have not come close yet to playing our best basketball,” Moody said. “We are excited for Christmas break so we can rest up and come back with everyone feeling rested.”\n\nMakenna Kansier shot Monroe (1-4) back into the game with 13 of her 16 points and three of her four 3- pointers in the third quarter.\n\n“Kansier for Monroe was lights out,” Moody said. “We didn’t panic when they cut our 15-point lead down to 2. We did a nice job in the fourth quarter to preserve the win.”\n\nTEMPERANCE – Bedford rallied after trailing by 5 points at halftime to earn a 49-45 win over Milan Saturday.\n\n“We played excellent defense in the third quarter, holding them to 6 points,” Bedford coach Nick Brillhart said. “Proud of how tough we played defensively in the second half.’\n\nBedford (4-4) scored 13 points in the third quarter to grab the lead.\n\nHenry Albring and Ish Hakki led the Mules with 10 points each while Corbin Miller finished with 8 points and 8 rebounds, and Nick Coberley and Payton Sheaves also chipped in 8 points each.\n\nZach Farmer of Milan led all scorers with 18 points. Landon Talladay added 12 for the 1-6 Big Reds.\n\nADDISON – Cody O'Hern (106), Sawyer Schaffer (132) and Karson Petit (157) won all five of their matches as Jefferson took second place in the Fred Boss Memorial Duals Saturday.\n\nThe Bears went 4-1 with wins over Onsted 50-30, Quincy 57-20, Hillsdale 55-28 and Coloma 48-35. Their lone loss was a tight 39-36 decision against Jackson North West.\n\nDino Gessner (113), Morgan Simota (120) and Devin Early (190) won four matches each.\n\nWOODHAVEN – David Mills and Jared Tunison both won two individual events for Erie Mason-Ida in the Woodhaven Warrior Relays Saturday.\n\nMills took the 200 (1:49.66) and 500 (5:01.32) freestyles and Tunison ruled the individual medley (2:07.95) and breaststroke (1:05.29).\n\nMills was part of the winning 200 and 400 relays. Tunison swam a leg o0n the 400. Other relay members were Tanner Heiden, Robert Otting, Mason Reynolds, Nelson Brenner and Brandon Tross\n\nMason-Ida just missed the team title with 403 points. Riverview won with 419.\n\nJR Hess took runner-up honors in the 500 freestyle and third in the backstroke for Dundee and Aaron Brewer and Kylor Freshour went 2-3 in diving.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Monroe News: Summerfield girls, Bedford boys head into holidays with nice wins",

    "description": "FC Bayern wants Dayot Upamecano to ink a new deal.",
    "fullText": "In recent days, the reports on the likelihood of Dayot Upamecano signing a contract extension have indicated that two major roadblocks (a signing bonus and a release clause) have become prevalent in the contract talks between the player’s camp and the club.\n\nBayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen re-emphasized that the club wants to bring back Upamecano and also that the environment will provide stability around the squad.\n\n“It’s common knowledge that we want to extend Upamecano’s contract. And I also believe we have nothing to be ashamed of regarding what we’ve offered him. It [the offer] reflects the outstanding performances Upa has delivered this season. Other factors often play a role in such a decision, not just the financial aspect. It shouldn’t be about every last euro,” Dreesen told Abendzeitung’s Maximilian Koch (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “The fact that the coach and coaching staff have extended their contracts is just as important. It’s also about whether the family feels comfortable, whether he has a good standing within the team and with the coach. Whether he’s playing for an ambitious club that actually wins things. Whether we’re playing attractive football. And I think those are good reasons for him to stay at FC Bayern.”\n\nHowever, when asked if he was confident that Upamecano would ultimately ink an extension, Dreesen did not want to express anything like that. Instead, he put the onus on Max Eberl and Christoph Freund to express their opinion on the matter.\n\n“That’s a question that mainly concerns Max Eberl and Christoph Freund. They are in good talks with Upa. I’d like to leave it at that assessment for now,” Dreesen stated.\n\nIn less than two weeks, Upamecano can formally talk to other clubs and at that point, we will all find out just how serious Upamecano is about his rumored requests for a signing bonus and a short-term release clause.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have been trying to solve their midfield issues for a while now.\n\nCasemiro’s resurgence has been praised, but at 33, he no longer has the legs to compete physically in the Premier League.\n\nThat can be seen from the fact that he has completed 90 minutes only three times this season, despite the Red Devils playing only once a week.\n\nSurprisingly, Kobbie Mainoo is not seen as a deep-lying playmaker, while Manuel Ugarte has earned the ire of his boss due to his lacklustre displays.\n\nRuben Amorim had identified Carlos Baleba of Brighton and Hove Albion as the perfect fit, but a summer deal proved beyond INEOS’ reach due to Brighton’s valuation.\n\nThe 21-year-old’s form subsequently fell off a cliff, with plenty of reports suggesting United had moved on to the likes of Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton.\n\nHe has 0 goals and assists this term, while at the same stage of last season, the Cameroon international had notched three goals and two assists.\n\nNot to mention he played the full 90 minutes a lot more times than the two games he has managed in the current campaign.\n\nBut Amorim remains convinced that the Cameroonian can be the heartbeat of his side, and it was suggested that the 20-time English league champions would revisit their interest come next summer.\n\nHowever, The Times have claimed that the Seagulls will continue to resist any attempts to sign their midfield dynamo.\n\nIn fact, Fabian Hürzeler’s side will not sanction a sale until 2027, which means the three-time Champions League winners will have to look elsewhere for now.\n\n“While United retain interest in Carlos Baleba, it is believed Brighton & Hove Albion’s plan is not to sell the 21-year-old until 2027.”\n\nA whole host of clubs are chasing Anderson, while Wharton will only move to a club which can offer him Champions League football.\n\nWhether INEOS persevere and still go after Carlos Baleba or whether they pivot and opt to sign someone else, only time will tell.\n\nFeature image Mike Hewitt via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The Denver Nuggets tipped off another game in Ball Arena on Saturday afternoon, seeking their seventh straight victory and third over the Houston Rockets this season.\n\nThe Nuggets found themselves particularly shorthanded, still without Aaron Gordon, Christian Braun, and Peyton Watson. Tim Hardaway Jr. started in Watson’s stead.\n\nThe Nuggets played some of their best defense of the season to open the game, but their offense never got off the runway, and the Rockets pulled away to snap Denver’s streak.\n\nThe Nuggets were down three key defenders as they took on the third-best offense in the NBA. And yet, they played some of their best defense of the season in the first quarter. The Nuggets forced six turnovers, an area in which they typically struggle, and scored nine points directly off those turnovers. They held Durant to 1-of-3 shooting in his first 10 minutes, and the Rockets to just 26 in the quarter.\n\nThe Nuggets failed to capitalize on their strong start in the first. In a rare occurrence, the offense sputtered in the second, and Denver couldn’t get anything going in the half-court. The Nuggets, owners of the highest offensive rating in the league and on pace to set the record, scored just 16 points in the quarter.\n\nHouston held the Nuggets to just 21 points in the third as well, making it by far the worst consecutive quarters of offense they’ve played this season.\n\nEveryone struggled from the field. Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray, Cam Johnson, and Tim Hardaway Jr. all shot below 50% in the loss.\n\nThe Nuggets have barely missed a beat since losing key players to injury, and Murray is a big reason why. But they didn’t look like they had two stars on the floor against Houston. Murray shot 4-of-13, finishing with just 16 points.\n\nJokić led the Nuggets in scoring, but he played an underwhelming game by his otherworldly standards. He never really dictated the action, and he played most of the game in foul trouble.\n\nWhile Denver’s offense failed to launch, the Rockets couldn’t miss. They shot 19-of-35 from deep, with three different players making at least five triples. Kevin Durant, Reed Sheppard, and Jabari Smith Jr. shot the lights out in Ball Arena. Even Josh Okogie shot 3-of-5.\n\nDurant led all scorers with 31. Sheppard scored all but one of Houston’s bench points with 28.",

    "fullText": "Best NFL players ever on the worst teams: Myles Garrett, Calvin Johnson and the 16 most wasted talents in history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCleveland edge rusher Myles Garrett is on the edge of making NFL history.\n\nGarrett – who has 21.5 sacks – can tie the NFL single-season sack record held by former Giants star Michael Strahan and Steelers edge rusher T.J Watt with his next sack. Garrett, of course, is playing for the Browns – who have been eliminated from the AFC playoff race.\n\nThat's going to beg the question: Is Garrett the best player on the worst team in NFL history? We're not just talking about this year. We're talking for the entirety of their career.\n\nSporting News identified 16 NFL stars – including eight Pro Football Hall of Fame players – who fit that description. We ranked those players based on four categories, including worst team winning percentage, playoff appearances (fewest scored higher), Pro Bowl selections (highest to lowest) and NFL MVP or AP Defensive Player of the Year Awards. In the event of a tie, the player whose teams had a lower winning percentage wen\n\nThis balances the great player vs. how good, or in this case bad, their team was.\n\nGarrett is in the top 10 along with another active edge rusher in the NFL. Who else made the list? A look at the 16 best NFL players on the worst teams.\n\nMORE:Tracking Myles Garrett's NFL single-season sacks record chase\n\nTeams: Saints (1999-2001), Dolphins (2002-03, 2005, 2007-10), Ravens (2011)\n\nWilliams – who rushed for 10,009 yards – had a rough start in New Orleans. He played for seven different head coaches – ranging from Mike Ditka to Nick Saban – retired for a year and was suspended for another. Williams played on a 3-13 team in New Orleans and a 1-15 team in Miami.\n\nTeams: Buccaneers (1987-92), Browns (1993-95), Ravens (1996-97), Jets (1998-2003, 2005), Cowboys (2004), Patriots (2006), Panthers (2007)\n\nTeam playoff record: 4–3 (2-3 as a starter)\n\nThe Buccaneers were 28-67 in six seasons after selecting Testaverde with the No. 1 pick in the 1987 NFL Draft. Testaverde was 23-25 in three seasons with Bill Belichick in Cleveland. He spent two seasons in Baltimore before the best stretch of his career with the Jets and made a start in the 1998 AFC championship game against Denver. Testaverde reunited with Bill Parcells in Dallas and Belichick in New England late in his career. He finished with a 90-123-1 record as a starter with 46,233 yards, which ranks 18th on the all-time list.\n\nTeams: Bengals (1996-2007), Ravens (2008)\n\nAnderson – a four-time Pro Bowl selection – played for four different coaches during the late 1990s and early 2000s \"Bungles\" era, and he played on just one winning team in 12 seasons with the franchise. Anderson played in one playoff game – a heart-breaking 31-17 loss to the Steelers in the AFC Wild Card round. Anderson did reach the AFC championship game with rival Balti\n\nTeams: Colts (1983-89), Falcons (1990-93), Vikings (1994-95)\n\nHinton – a seven-time Pro Bowl selection – was the player the Colts got in the John Elway trade. Hinton was a mainstay at tackle, but the Colts had four straight losing seasons after his arrival. Hinton played in four playoff games in his career, which also had stints with the Falcons and Vikings. He probably deserves more Pro Football Hall of Fame consideration.\n\nSanders – who ranks fourth all time in NFL history with 15,269 yards – played on decent teams. Detroit had a winning record in five of his 10 seasons and made the NFC championship game in 1991. Sanders abruptly retired in 1998 after the Lions finished 5-11 in 1998. Sanders' highlight reel has been passed down a few generations – but he never played in a Super Bowl.\n\nTeams: Rams (2004-12), Falcons (2013-14), Patriots (2015)\n\nJackson played on some miserable teams in St. Louis. The Rams averaged three wins per season from 2007-11 – a stretch in which Jackson had five straight 1,000-yard seasons. He finished his career with 11,438 rushing yards, and one of his two career playoff victories was in an abbreviated final season with the Patriots in 2015.\n\nSayers had a brief-but-brilliant career with the Bears, which was cut short by injuries. Sayers played for George Halas for four seasons – a stretch where Chicago compiled a 28-25-3 record. He led the NFL in rushing with 236 carries for 1,032 yards and eight TDs in 1969, a season in which the Bears finished 1-13.\n\nTeams: Saints (1993-2001); Chiefs (2002-05)\n\nRoaf was a dominant tackle in the NFL for the Saints – and he played for three head coaches in Jim Mora, Mike Ditka and Jim Haslett. New Orleans won one playoff game – a 34-24 victory against St. Louis in the NFC Wild Card round – on Dec. 30, 2000. He played four seasons with Kansas City – including two winning teams – to end his career.\n\nTeams: Jaguars (2006-13), Raiders (2014)\n\nJones-Drew helped Jacksonville reach the AFC divisional playoffs in his second season, but it went downhill from there despite a successful career in which he finished with 8,167 rushing yards in nine seasons. MJD played on teams that won an average of three games in his final three seasons between Jacksonville and Oakland.\n\nStephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nCrosby – who has 69.5 career sacks – has been with the franchise since the move from Oakland to Las Vegas. He has endured four straight losing seasons with the Raiders and has played for three coaches in each of the last three seasons. Yet Crosby remains on a trajectory that would get him to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Browns went 0-16 in Garrett's first season, so it's technically been uphill from there. Garrett has played for the same coach for six seasons in Kevin Stefanski, and the Browns did beat the Steelers 48-37 in the AFC Wild Card round on Jan. 10, 2021. It hasn't been all bad for the former No. 1 pick.\n\nJohnson never played on a team that won a playoff game. Detroit finished 0-16 in his second season, but \"Megatron\" continued to produce at a ridiculous level. The six-time Pro Bowl selection had 122 catches for a single-season record 1,964 receiving yards in 2012. Detroit had two winning seasons in nine years with Johnson on the field.\n\nKennedy – an eight-time Pro Bowl selection – never played on a team that won 10 games or \n\nYou can't think about the Tampa Bay creamsicle jerseys without Selmon, the six-time Pro Bowl selection who dominated at defensive tackle for the Bucs despite some woeful teams. Tampa Bay went 0-14 in Selmon's rookie season, and they lost 10 or more games six times in his nine seasons.\n\nButkus – arguably the most-feared defensive player of his era – was on the same teams as Gale Sayers, but the linebacker played two more seasons. Butkus made the Pro Bowl eight times in eight seasons before his final year, in which he played just nine games. He also finished in the top five in the NFL MVP voting twice despite playing for teams that finished with records of 8-8 and 7-9, respectively.\n\nThomas is the easiest choice here. He was a 10-time Pro Bowl selection in Cleveland despite a cast of revolving door of quarterbacks and coaches through one of the most-unstable periods for any franchise in NFL history. Cleveland went 10-6 in Thomas' first season. The Browns never won more than five games over the next 10 years, and Thomas' final season was the 0-16 year in 2017. Despite that, Thomas remains one of the most-beloved athletes in Cleveland sports history.",

    "description": "Padres Notes No. 6",
    "fullText": "The San Diego Padres President of Baseball Operations and General Manager A.J. Preller stated on the last day of MLB’s Winter Meetings that he wanted to get clarification of the starting rotation “sooner rather than later.” That was Dec. 10. During the press conference on Friday, Dec. 19, announcing the signing of returning right-handed starter Michael King to a three-year deal, King said the discussions with Preller got serious “about 10 days ago.” That was when Preller asked manager Craig Stammen and pitching coach Ruben Niebla to text King, asking about his willingness to come back to the Padres.\n\nWhile Preller was in Orlando discussing the trade market and the Padres’ need for starting pitching, he and the rest of the staff were working behind the scenes to bring King back into the fold. But that wasn’t the only player Preller was working to sign in the 10 days since the end of the winter meetings.\n\nAlthough not an official deal yet, Preller has apparently landed Korean infielder Sung-Mun Song to a three-year deal for a reported $13 million. Considered a top international free agent from Korea, Song has primarily been a third baseman but has also played second and first base for the Kiwoom Heroes. Although some evaluators consider him as a utility player with offensive upside, the transition to the MLB from the KBO can be a struggle for some hitters due to the velocity and movement MLB pitchers employ against hitters. If Song can make that transition, his upside is significant, and he could become a candidate for the first base job.\n\nThe end of his window for a commitment to an MLB team is Dec. 21. The Padres will need to officially commit by then or he returns back to the Heroes. If the deal becomes official, the organization will owe his Korean team a posting fee of 20 percent of his contract amount up to $25 million.\n\nAn under-the-radar signing occurred this past week when Preller signed RHP Triston McKenzie to a minor league contract. McKenzie is also receiving an invite to Spring Training with his deal. Coming from a long stint in the Guardians organization, where he worked with former Guardians and current Padres pitching coach Ruben Niebla, McKenzie has a spotted history but significant upside.\n\nHe posted a 2.92 ERA over 30 starts in 2022 for the Guardians but then developed elbow and shoulder injuries and hasn’t been the same player since. He had a 11.12 ERA in four big-league appearances last season and wasn’t any better in the Dominican Winter League with 11.2 innings pitched and a 5.40 ERA. A reunion with Niebla could be exactly what the doctor ordered, and the Padres are taking a low-risk and high-reward gamble.\n\n“Those are always intriguing players – somebody that’s coming back from injuries, has something to prove,” said general manager A.J. Preller, speaking at Friday’s press conference to announce the signing of King. “In a different organization, maybe we can unlock something there. But he’s always been a super talented guy.”\n\nAt 6-5 and 164 pounds, the 28-year-old McKenzie provides potential back end of the rotation upside or rotation depth. If he and the Padres pitching coaches can straighten out his issues, he could be the kind of project that the organization has excelled at in the past.\n\nThe Padres made Craig Stammen’s coaching staff official and former bench coach Brian Esposito will be reassigned within the organization but will not be a part of the major league staff. They also announced further additions besides what had already been reported and these include former Triple-A hitting coach Raul Padron as the hitting instructor to round out a four-person hitting staff. They also have designated Vinny Lopez as outfield and base running instructor, which is also part of first base coach Dave Macias’ job.\n\nDespite some apparent repetition of job titles and roles, Stammen’s staff appears to be a team approach to instruction and managing. This reflects his own statements after his hiring. He acknowledged that he will employ more experienced personnel around him to make sure all the needs of the team are covered.\n\nThe Padres re-signed RHP Omar Cruz to a minor league contract. The 26-year-old had been part of the major league roster last season but was waived at the end of the year. The signing allows him to remain with the organization and could involve a Spring Training invite as well as providing needed pitching depth.\n\nRHP Justin Yeager was signed to a minor league deal. Yeager is a reliever formerly with the Brewers organization and is 27 years old. He played at the end of 2025 at the Triple-AAA level.\n\nRHP Albieris Polanco was signed to a minor league deal. The 19-year-old is an international free agent from the Dominican Republic.\n\nCatcher Blake Hunt was re-signed by the Padres to a minor league contract. Hunt was drafted by the Padres in 2017 as a second rounder. He was part of the deal for Blake Snell and since 2021 has bounced around with multiple organizations, becoming a free agent in November of this year and signing with the Padres on Dec. 16.\n\nRHP Nathanael Jacinto signed a minor league deal on Dec. 12. The 20-year-old Dominican Republic native was an international free agent.\n\nPadres reliever and presumed closer, Mason Miller, was named to Team USA for the WBC tournament. He becomes the first Padre named to the USA team and follows Manny Machado, Fernando Tatis Jr. and Xander Bogaerts as Padres leaving the team during Spring Training to compete in the WBC. It will be his first opportunity to pitch for Team USA and he joins a loaded USA team.",

    "description": "\"Michigan State is gonna be a problem.\"",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff is dominating the national landscape on Saturday, but Michigan State made some noise with a notable hire that has received some positive feedback.\n\nIt was reported on Saturday afternoon that Michigan State football is \"expected\" to hire Alabama co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Nick Sheridan. The news of the expected hiring came out mid-day on Saturday, with 247Sports' Matt Zenitz breaking the news.\n\nSheridan has been with Alabama head coach Kalen DeBoer for the last four seasons -- two of which at Washington and two with the Crimson Tide. Prior to that, he was the offensive coordinator at Indiana for two seasons.\n\nThe expected hire has drawn some positive and negative reviews on social media, but one popular college football account is raving about the move from new Michigan Stat head coach Pat Fitzgerald. Shortly after the news of the hire was reported, CFBTalkDaily posted a positive response to the news and stated \"Michigan State is (going to) be a problem.\"\n\nPat Fitzgerald gets who he wants \n\nMichigan State is gonna be a problem https://t.co/CszewElHUm\n\n— CFBTalkDaily (@CFBTalkDaily) December 20, 2025\n\nThis is obviously a positive backing of Sheridan coming to Michigan State, but is also propping up the other hires Fitzgerald has made thus far for his staff. This has been a common take for fans to this point, and it sounds like adding Sheridan to the mix will only further that opinion.\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

To do so, DeSoto must get past Houston Sheldon King, which is making its state championship game debut, in Saturday night’s University Interscholastic League 6A Division II championship game.\n\nLIVE STREAM:Victory+ (Victory Plus) will stream for free all 12 UIL state championship games.\n\nDeSoto is in the title game for the fourth time in program history, and the Eagles have won all three times they’ve previously gotten this far.

The Eagles then started this season 0-2 with losses to Creekside (Ga.) and North Crowley.\n\nBut they’ve rounded more into form from there, winning 12 of their next 13 contests, with the only defeat in that span to Duncanville, which played for the 6A Division I championship earlier on Saturday.\n\nDeSoto avenged last season’s playoff defeat to Longview by beating the Lobos in the area round, 60-28. The Eagles have scored at least 56 points in all five playoff wins, including last week, when they rallied in the second half to defeat previously undefeated Southlake Carroll, 57-44.\n\nSheldon King enters its first state championship game at 13-2. The Panthers’ lone two defeats came to Dickinson, which reached the 6A DI regional finals, and Galena Park North Shore, which played for the 6A DI title earlier on Saturday.\n\nIn the playoffs, King scored at least 50 points in its first three games. Two weeks ago, in the regional final round, the Panthers got past Humble Summer Creek, 24-21, before downing defending 6A DII state champion Austin Vandegrift, 58-41, in the semifinals last week.\n\nNow, in the final game of the 2025 Texas high school football season, King wants to conclude things with its first title while DeSoto attempts to continue a dynastic run.\n\nFollow The Sporting News correspondent Buck Ringgold (@Bucks_Ballpark) for all of the live updates and scoring from Arlington.\n\nScroll down for live score and game updates from kickoff to the postgame.

    "fullText": "Myles Garrett is determined to break sack record at home against Bills originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEven though the Cleveland Browns are having a great season by any means, one of the only bright spots they've had is the elite play from defensive end Myles Garrett.\n\nThe pass rusher has consistently been among the best, alongside guys like T.J. Watt and Micah Parsons, since entering the league in 2017; in fact, since then, Garrett has recorded 10 or more sacks in each season after his rookie season.\n\nHowever, this has by far been his best season, and he is on the cusp of breaking the single-season sacks record, which is currently shared by Watt and NFL Hall of Famer Michael Strahan, who both had 22.5 sacks.\n\nGarrett is likely to find himself solely at the top of the mountain, only needing 1.5 sacks to break the record with three games left to play, including Sunday against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nLast week, the Browns suffered a lopsided loss to the Chicago Bears, and Garrett got to Caleb Williams multiple times, but it wasn't enough to tie or break the record. The two even joked about it during post-game handshakes, with Williams telling the defensive end, \"I couldn't let you get it on me.\"\n\nHowever, Garrett sees the good in the situation, as he now has the opportunity to make history in front of the home crowd.\n\nWhen asked about the record on Friday, Garrett added, \"I want it here in front of the fans.\" He would later also declare that getting the win is still the top priority.\n\nThe Browns will also be at home against the Pittsburgh Steelers next week, meaning Garrett has two chances to deliver on that wish to the fans.\n\nMyles Garrett sacks tracker: Updated 2025 total for Browns star amid chase for NFL single-season record\n\nBrowns' Shedeur Sanders struggles in a way an NFL QB hasn't since John Beck in 2007\n\nShedeur Sanders stats today: Bears defense overwhelms Browns rookie with three interceptions, five sacks\n\nMyles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record in loss to Bears\n\nBrowns' Myles Garrett makes incredible Godzilla, King of Monsters self-comparison\n\nBrowns' Shedeur Sanders is under pressure more than any QB since 2009",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are currently fully focused on their upcoming Week 16 matchup with the Baltimore Ravens. However, their front office already likely has an eye on the offseason, where disgruntled San Francisco 49ers’ wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk could emerge as a potential target for the team.\n\nAiyuk has been floated as a trade target for New England over the past couple of years, but he hasn’t played for San Francisco at all this season due to a dispute with the team. As a result, reports indicate the two sides are likely to part ways this upcoming offseason.\n\nWhile there is quite a bit of drama surrounding Aiyuk, his play on the field when he’s been healthy makes him a guy worth considering for the Patriots. However, he recently shared a video of himself driving over 90 MPH past the Niners’ stadium, Levi’s Stadium, which is well over the speed limit in that area.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk posted a new YouTube video where in it, he is going over 90 MPH past Levi’s Stadium 🏟️ #FTTB | #49ers pic.twitter.com/g0Q4GXUmnU\n\n— 49ers & NFL News 24/7 (@49ersSportsTalk) December 20, 2025\n\nThere’s been a lot of mystery and mystique surrounding Aiyuk’s stunning fall from grace with the 49ers. Whatever the reason may be, though, he will likely be up for grabs, and if the Patriots want him, now may be the time to pounce.\n\nIn 2023, Aiyuk enjoyed a breakout campaign, as he caught 75 passes for 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns, earning him a spot on the All-Pro Second Team. After getting a four-year, $120 million contract, Aiyuk struggled in seven games last season (25 REC, 374 YDS) before suffering a torn ACL, which ended his season.\n\nSerious questions surround Aiyuk, and it remains to be seen how much interest he will draw over the offseason. If the price is right, though, he could be worth taking a flier on, as New England needs all the top-end wide receiver talent that it can get.\n\nShould Patriots Renew Brandon Aiyuk Pursuit Amid 49ers Release Rumors?",

    "fullText": "Washington State improved to 5-8 with its second consecutive win, defeating the Mercer Bears 84-78. Mercer, out of the Southern Conference, traveled to Pullman at 7–4 looking to snap a two-game skid.\n\nKenPom projected a 79-75 win for the Cougars, and the betting line sat at WSU -7.5.\n\nThe game got off to a shaky start as the Cougs surrendered a wide-open three to Mercer, and ND Oakafor picked up an early technical foul.\n\nThe teams traded buckets early, with the Cougs coming out hot and scoring 13 points in the first four minutes. However, the offense soon went stagnant, as turnover issues plagued Washington State once again. The Cougs managed just two points over the next six minutes.\n\nDefensive struggles resurfaced for WSU, allowing Mercer to score 25 points in the first ten minutes. Ace Glass helped keep the Cougars afloat, starting 5-of-8 from the floor.\n\nDefensive intensity picked up for Washington State, but the Bears reached the bonus with five minutes remaining in the half due to several chintzy off-ball fouls.\n\nThere was very little separation between the teams in the first half. Glass scored 14 points before the break, and the Cougs shot an impressive 59% from the field. Despite that efficiency, WSU led by just two, 41–39. Eight turnovers allowed Mercer to attempt eight more shots than Washington State.\n\nThe Cougs opened the second half strong, highlighted by a deep three from Glass that pushed the lead to five. Mercer responded immediately and tied the game.\n\nAdria Rodriguez delivered a strong defensive performance, recording a steal and a score and making his presence felt throughout the game. Adria seems to be playing far more confident than earlier in the season, coming up with 7 points as-well.\n\nThen the Cougars finally erupted. WSU hit eight straight field goals, including three triples from Ri Vavers, stretching the lead to 14.\n\nWashington State had opportunities to put the game away but failed to capitalize, missing multiple easy looks off turnovers. ND Oakafor also missed two free throws after a missed dunk. The lead never grew beyond fourteen.\n\nCoach David Riley later went to a lineup in which Thrastarson was the primary scoring threat, and the offense went ice cold.\n\nThe Cougs slowed down near the finish line as Mercer’s Baraka Okojie continued to knock down mid-range jumpers. The Bears extended the game with fouling and quick shots but never cut the deficit to fewer than five points.\n\nGlass finished with 24 points on 8-of-14 shooting. It was a balanced offensive effort for the Cougars, with four other players scoring in double figures. Eemeli Yalaho posted a strong performance with 14 points and eight rebounds, while Rihards Vavers came off the bench to hit four three-pointers. WSU shot 54% from the floor, and sunk 11 of their 23 three-point attempts.\n\nThis had the makings of a comfortable win for the Cougars, who entered the game ranked 154th in KenPom among a group of teams with winning records. However, the finish left much to be desired, as WSU effectively put on the brakes. The Cougs could have won by 20 or more, but instead escaped with a six-point victory.\n\nWashington State has played much better since returning from the Maui Invitational, holding opponents under 80 points in six straight games after allowing 80-plus in five of their first six contests. At 5-8, the Cougs have dropped four swing-games to Idaho, Arizona State, Bradley, and USC.\n\nUSC currently ranks 39th in KenPom, Arizona State sits at 64th, and Bradley at 119th, showing that Washington State has competed well against solid opponents recently.\n\nHopefully, David Riley can build on this two-game winning streak as conference play approaches. The Cougs will make a brief Pacific Northwest swing, facing the Portland Pilots in Portland on December 28 before traveling to Seattle to take on the Redhawks on December 30. Seattle U recently upset Washington and sits at 10-2, setting up a fun matchup for Coug fans at Climate Pledge Arena.\n\nWashington State’s next contest, at the University of Portland, will air on ESPN+ at 2:00 p.m. on December 28.",

    "description": "Trinidad Chabliss and Mississippi have aced their first test without former coach Lane Kiffin. The sixth-ranked Rebels beat No. 17 Tulane 41-10 on Saturday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.",
    "fullText": "OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Trinidad Chambliss ran for two touchdowns and passed for another, and No. 6 Mississippi looked unfazed by the defection of coach Lane Kiffin, beating No. 17 Tulane 41-10 on Saturday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\n\nScoring runs of 20 yards by Kewan Lacy and 4 yards by Chambliss gave Ole Miss (12-1) a 14-0 lead before eight minutes had elapsed in the coaching debut of Pete Golding, who was promoted from defensive coordinator after Kiffin left for LSU on Nov. 30.\n\nNext up for Golding and Ole Miss: a CFP quarterfinal against No. 2 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1\n\nTulane (11-3) and quarterback Jake Retzlaff moved the ball effectively at times, but the Rebels — who beat the Green Wave 45-10 on Sept. 20 — remained comfortably ahead throughout. Cornerback Jaylon Braxton had an early interception, and the Rebels’ defense had multiple fumble recoveries and fourth-down stops.\n\nWhile Kiffin had asked to keep coaching Ole Miss through the playoff even while working for its Southeastern Conference rival, athletic director Keith Carter would not allow it. So the Rebels entered arguably the most significant game ever played at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium with a new coach — not to mention an unprecedented level of looming staff and roster uncertainty for a team contending for a national title.\n\nIn Mississippi’s famed Grove, artwork around tailgate tents depicted Kiffin in a negative light, including one showing him on a Christmas “naughty” list, with Golding in the “nice” column.\n\nWhen Golding walked onto the field during warm-ups, the crowd roared. Fans continued cheering as Eli Manning, a former Ole Miss QB and two-time Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants, greeted the new Rebels coach on the sideline.\n\nOn the opposite sideline was Tulane coach Jon Sumrall, who was permitted to keep coaching the Green Wave after being hired by Florida. His hopes of returning to Tulane’s home city of New Orleans to prepare for the Sugar Bowl were dashed, and he’ll be packing up for Gainesville, Florida, to join the Gators.\n\nChambliss, who briefly left the game late in the first half after a big hit during an 11-yard scramble, finished with 282 yards passing. Lacy rushed for 87 yards before heading to the locker room in the fourth quarter with an apparent left shoulder injury. De’Zhaun Stribling caught five passes for 79 yards, including a 13-yard TD.\n\nLSU transfer Logan Diggs added a 3-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.\n\nRetzlaff finished with 306 yards passing and a TD for Tulane, whose loss dropped non-power conference teams to 0-3 in CFP games (with James Madison playing at Oregon later Saturday night). Jamauri McClure gained 84 yards on 15 carries.\n\nTulane: The Green Wave could not afford a poor start on defense and got exactly that as the Rebels scored two TDs on their first seven offensive plays. As in the teams’ first meeting, Tulane moved the ball in spurts, finishing with 421 yards, but could sustain drives long enough to score.\n\nOle Miss: Kiffin’s absence didn’t inhibit the Rebels’ explosiveness on offense — at least not against a team from a non-power conference. The Rebels finished 497 yards of total offense, including four plays that went for 25 yards or more.",

    "fullText": "Ranking 3 Key Golden State Warriors Trade Targets originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are expected to get active in the NBA trade market once again.\n\nAfter making a handful of notable trades during the 2024-2025 season, the Warriors are keeping an eye on several targets just months before the deadline. According to the NBA insider Chris Haynes, the Warriors have three names on their radar as they look to boost the front court.\n\n\"They are looking for size and athleticism. You look at the Warriors, rebounding and blocking shots, they're in the bottom half of the league. And points in the paint, they are dead last. So they are looking for an athletic center,\" Haynes said on NBA on Prime on Friday night.\n\nWhat the Bucks and Warriors are looking for on the trade market for @NBAonPrime. pic.twitter.com/Pl2CcXo5AV\n\n— Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) December 20, 2025\n\nDallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford was the first name to come up, and he just might be at the top of the list. The 27-year-old big man is a former second-round pick out of Arkansas.\n\nGafford is playing for his third team since entering the NBA in 2019, having previous stints with the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards. Last season, he appeared in 57 games for the Mavs, averaging 12.3 points and 6.8 rebounds. This year, he’s producing 8.5 points per game, while coming down with 6.1 rebounds and blocking 1.5 shots in 17 games.\n\nThe Mavericks are currently paying $14.3 million to Gafford. He has a $54 million extension kicking in next season.\n\nWhile he only has two playoff runs on his resume, Gafford had a meaningful postseason run in 2024 with 22 appearances, maintaining his regular-season averages.\n\nNic Claxton of the Brooklyn Nets is another reported target for Golden State. Although the Nets invested nearly $100 million in Claxton last year, they remain in a rebuilding mode. Sitting 13th in the Eastern Conference with a 7-19 record, the Nets are expected to operate as sellers ahead of the deadline.\n\nSince 2019, Claxton has been a part of three playoff runs in Brooklyn. Between 2022 and 2023, the Nets faced two first-round sweeps, limiting Claxton's chances of improving his postseason value. Despite the lack of experience, Claxton is a logical candidate.\n\nLastly, the Portland Trail Blazers center, Robert Williams, is gaining attention from the Warriors’ front office, according to Haynes. The 28-year-old former first-round pick is in year three with the Portland Trail Blazers after spending several seasons with the Boston Celtics.\n\nWilliams was a defensive standout with the Celtics before leaving for Portland in 2023. Since his exit from the Celtics, Williams has struggled to stay healthy. He underwent multiple knee surgeries over the past couple of years, limiting his production with the Blazers.\n\nThis season, Williams has appeared in 17 games for the Blazers. With an average of 15 minutes of playing time off the bench, he has produced averages of 5.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks this year.\n\nThe idea of Williams on the Warriors might seem great, but his injury history is certainly a concern.\n\nWhile Williams, Gafford, and Claxton are three names to keep an eye on in December, several other options could pop up for the Warriors as the season plays out. It’s unclear who the Warriors will end up with, but the 13-15 squad from Golden State is expected to make some important roster changes before the market closes.",

    "fullText": "Move over, Magic Johnson. You’re no longer considered the best point guard to ever play the game of basketball. At least not in the eyes of Jaylen Brown.\n\nThe Boston Celtics star recently went live on Twitch with streamer DDG to discuss a bunch of different topics, and when the topic of Stephen Curry came up, Brown couldn’t help but admit that, in his view, Curry is the best point guard ever.\n\n“Curry gotta be (the) best PG all time,” Brown said.\n\nJaylen Brown: \"Curry gotta be the best [point guard of all-time].\"\n\nDDG: \"I got him over Michael Jordan.\"\n\nBrown: \"I don't know if I can ride with that. But I'm very high on Steph Curry.\"\n\n(via @DDG/ Twitch)pic.twitter.com/IPf7QjdfUK\n\n— ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) December 18, 2025\n\nInterestingly, Brown brought up Curry’s intangibles when discussing why he’s so special.\n\n“Steph is a leader,” Brown said. “(There’s) stuff that you don’t also see … Steph has leadership ability … some people just hoop. It’s not just basketball when you’re playing basketball. You gotta be a leader. You gotta be a good teammate. You gotta handle adversity well. That’s how you win championships. Steph does that well. He carries himself very well on and off the court.”\n\nWhile some NBA traditionalists might scoff at Jaylen’s notion of Curry being the GOAT point guard, Curry actually has a very solid case.\n\nAt age 37, Curry continues to play at a superstar level despite his size and average athleticism, recently dropping 48 points against the Portland Trail Blazers while breaking Michael Jordan’s record for most 40-point games after turning 30.\n\nSteph’s four championships with Golden State include two won without Kevin Durant (for people making superteam allegations), and Curry won back-to-back MVPs in his prime.\n\nPerhaps more than any of his trophies or accolades, Steph’s impact is revealed by how he’s completely changed the sport. Curry’s revolutionary three-point shooting literally transformed basketball, forcing defenses to adapt and inspiring a new wave of modern offensive philosophy.\n\nMagic dazzled with his passing, all-around dominance and five rings, but Curry’s scoring prowess and style, with over 3,900 career threes, is something the league has never seen before. Today’s pace-and-space game is a testament to Curry’s influence. You can’t go wrong with either player at the top of point guard mountain, but more people need to start acknowledging that Curry has as rightful a place up there as Magic.\n\nJayson Tatum Drops Truth Bomb On Celtics’ 2024 NBA Finals Victory",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox have already addressed the starting rotation with trades for Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo. However, they are reportedly interested in Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta.\n\nAccording to The Athletic on Dec. 10, the Red Sox are among the teams interested in Peralta. He is one year away from free agency and is playing on an $8 million club option next season. While he is affordable for the Brewers right now, the team may feel it’s time to trade him before they cannot afford him, just as they did with Corbin Burnes, Devin Williams and Josh Hader.\n\nIt was expected to take a haul to land Peralta before, but after Shane Baz was dealt for four top 30 prospects and a 2026 Competitive Balance Round A Draft pick, Peralta’s asking price could have gone up. Baz had three more years of control, playing into the massive return, but he is not near the level of pitcher Peralta.\n\nBaz has a 4.25 career ERA and had a 4.87 ERA in 31 starts. He is younger than Peralta, but Peralta is already a proven ace. He is a two-time All-Star and is coming off the best year of his career.\n\nPeralta had a 2.70 ERA in 33 starts and notched at least 200 strikeouts for the third consecutive season. With just one year of control left, it’s unlikely he will demand the same haul as Baz, but the Brewers can likely up their asking price after seeing what Baz was dealt for.\n\nBaz is expected to be a middle-rotation arm for the Baltimore Orioles. If that was able to net four great prospects, Peralta may be able to yield the Brewers at least two top 30 prospects. When the Brewers traded Corbin Burnes, they got DL Hall and Joey Ortiz, who was a top 100 prospect at the time.\n\nThe market is different every year, and Baz’s deal may have made it significantly harder to land Peralta. While he would certainly improve the Red Sox and be their No. 2 starter, the price to land him may not be worth it.\n\nJust one year after trading away four top 30 prospects to acquire Garrett Crochet, the Red Sox may not want to deplete the farm system again for one year of Peralta.\n\nRed Sox Sign Pitcher After Six Seasons With Dodgers",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Pirates have been quite busy over the past couple of days, as their front office is making good on their promise to improve the roster over the offseason. Prior to the recent flurry of moves, one of the Pirates’ bigger moves in free agency came earlier this month when they signed relief pitcher Gregory Soto to a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nA two-time All-Star, Soto is one of the premier left-handed relievers in the league. He didn’t have his best season in 2025 (1-5, 4.18 ERA, 1 SV, 70 K, 1.43 WHIP), but Soto can be used in just about any high-leverage situation, which makes him very valuable. Now, he’s joining an upstart Pirates team, and he’s looking forward to helping this group improve in 2026.\n\n“What I saw in the Pirates was a group of young guys with a lot of talent and with the desire to win, and that’s something that I’ve built throughout the years. I’ve been in the league for a few years now and I want to come here and contribute to that,” Soto said.\n\nSoto will immediately become a key piece of Pittsburgh’s bullpen, and he could even be a candidate to close games, as he has 56 saves over his seven-year career. Regardless of his role, his presence will help make the Pirates’ bullpen a much better group in 2026, and it will be worth keeping tabs on the team to see if they make any more big moves in the coming weeks.\n\nMore MLB: Pirates Finalize 2026 Coaching Staff With Five New Hires\n\nThe post Gregory Soto Explains Decision To Sign With Pirates In Free Agency appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "description": "The Dallas Cowboys have officially been eliminated from playoff contention.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nYou may have felt that this was the case for some time already in a matter of fact sense, but it became official on Saturday night when the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Washington Commanders. Thanks to losses over the last two weeks to the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings the Cowboys left themselves with only one path into the postseason and that was as the hypothetical winner of the NFC East. That will not come to pass as the Eagles have now won it.\n\nMuch is always made about how the NFC East has not featured a back-to-back champion since 2003 and 2004 when the Eagles did it themselves. They have put that all to an end by doing it once more and on the subject of streaks the Cowboys now have one going themselves as far as playoff absences are concerned.\n\nDallas missed the playoffs last year, they were eliminated around the same time as it happened on December 22nd, which means they have missed the postseason for two years in a row for the first time since 2019 and 2020. Then, like now, the Cowboys were in the final year of one head coach (Jason Garrett) and the first of another (Mike McCarthy). It is almost like that is not necessarily a recipe for success.\n\nThere is a lot of introspection that is necessary from the Cowboys these days and their current playoff drought is representative of that. We talk often about how this team hasn’t been the same since they were bounced from the 2023 Wild Card Round and obviously the evidence here speaks for that as well.\n\nWe now know conclusively that there are only 3 games left on the season for the Cowboys. We also know that their drought for Super Bowl and/or NFC Championship Game appearances (the drought that Stephen Jones didn’t understand to exist) will officially grow to 30 years. It is not an approximation or a rounding up.",

They will now look to finish the season on a high note, starting with Los Angeles and ending with the two road matchups versus the Commanders and the New York Giants.\n\nA lot of questions will need to be answered this offseason in Dallas, as the franchise has won just two playoff games since 2016, the beginning of the Dak Prescott era, and is still in danger of posting a third losing season in six years.\n\nJosh Jacobs, Christian Watson playing statuses revealed as Packers release inactives\n\nIs D'Andre Swift playing tonight?

In the process, they could potentially turn one of the safest parts of the corporate-bond market into a slightly riskier one. Companies will borrow more, boosting the supply of the bonds and potentially weighing on valuations. At the same time, industry profits could face pressure as regulators try to keep a lid on rate increases.",

    "fullText": "I’m bearish on any sort of memory system that isn’t integrated into the model or a fronteir capability for continual learning. The same is true for integrated auxiliary context systems; things that may naively/blindly pollute the context window. I don’t think the overhead & NLP overlap is worth it in the early days of agentic systems like Claude Code.\n\nWith a simple Agent Skill called rg_history, we can give Claude Code the ability to search its own memory.\n\nClaude Code already has a memory system and it exists on disk. Here is a simple agent skill to keep claude informed of its recall capabilities over the session directory and with ripgrep. pic.twitter.com/A2iWUMeQ4h\n\nI think we’re still figuring out what it really means to have an agent on a computer and to be able to access things like the file system. A benefit of Claude Code is its entire memory already exists on the file-system.\n\nClaude Code stores every conversation as JSONL files on disk. Each message, tool call, file edit, and decision lives in ~/.claude/projects/{project}/. All rationale and iteration over time right here, perfectly preserved with extra context that wasn’t even visible in chat. This is already a memory system. We just need to read it.\n\nEverything is there. Chronological. Structured. Greppable.\n\nripgrep (rg) is a line-oriented search tool. It’s fast enough that searching megabytes of session history feels instant. More importantly, it’s precise: regex patterns, file filtering, context lines, match limiting.\n\nThe key insight for JSONL: each event is one long line. Raw output is unreadable. But ripgrep can extract snippets:\n\nThis is the entire technique. Count, snippet, narrow, then full context only when you know what you want.\n\nWe built a Rust CLI called lookback with boolean query parsing (AND/OR operators) and snippet extraction. It works. It’s also unnecessary complexity.\n\nWhen we compared it against raw ripgrep for finding specific information in session history, ripgrep won. Fewer queries, clearer results. The structure of the raw JSON actually helped — seeing \"name\":\"Edit\" next to \"file_path\" immediately shows what happened.\n\nThe boolean query parser was clever. But rg 'pattern' | rg 'filter' does the same thing.\n\nSession files are append-only logs. New events add lines; nothing mutates. This means:\n\nhttps://github.com/backnotprop/rg_history\n\nA skill file teaches Claude Code how to search its own history:\n\nThe skill is ~100 lines of markdown. No database. No embedding service. No API keys.\n\nThe file system was the memory system all along.",

    "description": "Albert Einsteins quote, “Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving,” highlights the idea that progress, however slow, is essential for maintaining stability. Stagnation often leads to imbalance, while steady movement encourages clarity and confidence, making it a timeless lesson for navigating lifes challenges.",
    "fullText": "“Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.” This timeless quote by Albert Einstein offers a simple yet profound lesson about life, resilience and growth. Though brief, the message continues to resonate with people navigating uncertainty, change and everyday challenges.\n\nWhat Is the Meaning of This Albert Einstein Quote?\nThrough this quote, Albert Einstein compares life to riding a bicycle. Balance, he suggests, does not come from standing still but from constant movement. In practical terms, this means progress, no matter how slow, is essential to maintaining stability in life.\n\nEinstein’s words highlight an important truth: stagnation often leads to discomfort, fear and imbalance, while movement brings clarity and confidence.\n\nWhy This Quote by Albert Einstein Still Matters Today\nIn today’s world, where people often feel stuck due to personal, professional or social pressures, this quote feels especially relevant. From career setbacks to emotional struggles, life rarely offers perfect conditions. Yet, Einstein reminds us that waiting for everything to be ideal is not the solution.\n\nWhether it is learning a new skill, starting over after failure, or simply taking small daily steps, forward movement is key to staying mentally and emotionally balanced.\n\nLife Lessons Hidden in Einstein’s Bicycle Metaphor\nThe bicycle metaphor is powerful because it is relatable. Anyone who has learned to ride a bicycle knows that stopping completely often leads to falling. Similarly, in life, fear of failure can hold people back.\n\nEinstein’s quote encourages persistence over perfection. It reassures us that progress does not need to be dramatic. Even slow, steady movement is enough to maintain balance and direction.\n\nHow This Quote Applies to Career, Health and Relationships\nIn careers, the quote suggests continuous learning and adaptability. In health, it highlights the importance of consistent habits rather than sudden transformations. In relationships, it reminds us that communication and effort are necessary to maintain balance.\n\nEinstein’s wisdom fits seamlessly into modern life, making the quote relevant across age groups and professions.\n\nWhy Albert Einstein’s Quotes Remain Universally Popular\nAlbert Einstein’s quotes endure because they are rooted in human experience, not just science. His ability to express complex ideas in simple language makes his thoughts accessible to everyone.\n\nThis quote, in particular, reflects Einstein’s belief in growth, curiosity and perseverance, values that remain essential in every era.\n\nQuote of the Day by Albert Einstein\n“Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving” is more than a motivational line. It is a gentle reminder to embrace motion, accept change and trust the process of life.\n\nIn moments of doubt or hesitation, Einstein’s words encourage us to take the next step, because balance comes from movement, not stillness.\n\n(You can now Read More News onalbert einstein quotequote of the day einsteinalbert einstein life quotesfamous einstein quotesinspirational quotes by einsteineinstein quote meaningmotivational quotes by albert einsteinwisdom quotes by einsteineinstein quotes on lifedaily inspirational quotes \n(You can now Read More News onalbert einstein quotequote of the day einsteinalbert einstein life quotesfamous einstein quotesinspirational quotes by einsteineinstein quote meaningmotivational quotes by albert einsteinwisdom quotes by einsteineinstein quotes on lifedaily inspirational quotes",

    "title": "Impeachment in the United States",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "In the United States, impeachment is the process by which a legislature may bring charges against an elected member of the executive branch or an appointed official for severe alleged misconduct, and may result in removal of the guilty from their position after the consequential trial. In addition to Congress at the federal level, impeachment may occur at the state level if the state or commonwealth has provisions for it under its constitution. Impeachment might also occur with tribal governments as well as at the local level of government. Separate procedures are in place for elected members of the legislature to remove a peer for a comparable level of misconduct.\n\nThe federal House of Representatives can impeach a party with a simple majority of the House members present or such other criteria as the House adopts in accordance with Article One, Section 2, Clause 5 of the United States Constitution. This triggers a federal impeachment trial in the United States Senate, which can vote by a two-thirds majority to convict an official, removing them from office. The Senate can also further, with just a simple-majority vote, vote to bar an individual convicted in a senate impeachment trial from holding future federal office.\n\nMost state legislatures can impeach state officials, including the governor, in accordance with their respective state constitution. A number of organized United States territories do as well. Additionally, impeachment is a practice of other government bodies, such as tribal governments.\n\nImpeachment proceedings are remedial rather than punitive in nature, and the remedy is limited to removal from office. Because the process is not punitive, a party may also be subject to criminal or civil trial, prosecution, and conviction under the law after removal from office. Also because the conviction is not a punishment, the president of the United States is constitutionally prevented from granting a pardon to impeached and convicted persons, that may have protected them from the consequences of a conviction in an impeachment trial.\n\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the United States Constitution provides:\n\nThe House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\n\nArticle I, Section 3, Clauses 6 and 7 provide:\n\nThe Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present.\nJudgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States; but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\n\nArticle II, Section 2 provides:\n\n[The President] ... shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\n\nArticle II, Section 4 provides:\n\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.[1]\n\nThe Constitution limits grounds of impeachment to \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\",[2] but does not itself define \"high crimes and misdemeanors\".\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the authority to impeach and remove \"The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States\" upon a determination that such officers have engaged in treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. The Constitution does not articulate who qualifies as a \"civil officer of the United States\".[3] Federal judges are subject to impeachment.[4] Within the executive branch, any presidentially appointed \"principal officer\", including a head of an agency such as a secretary, administrator, or commissioner, is a \"civil officer of the United States\" subject to impeachment.[5] At the opposite end of the spectrum, lesser functionaries, such as federal civil service employees, do not exercise \"significant authority\", and are not appointed by the president or an agency head. These employees do not appear to be subject to impeachment, though that may be a matter of allocation of House floor debate time by the Speaker, rather than a matter of law.\n\nThe Senate has concluded that members of Congress (representatives and senators) are not \"civil officers\" for purposes of impeachment.[6] As a practical matter, expulsion is effected by the simpler procedures of Article I, Section 5, which provides \"Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members ... Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member\" (see List of United States senators expelled or censured and List of United States representatives expelled, censured, or reprimanded). This allows each House to expel its own members without involving the other chamber. In 1797, the House of Representatives impeached Senator William Blount of Tennessee.[7]\n\nThe constitutional text is silent on whether an officer can be tried after the officer resigns or their term ends. However, when the issue has arisen, the House has been willing to impeach after resignation, and the Senate has been willing to try the official after resignation. In 1797, the Senate continued impeachment proceedings against William Blount even after he had been expelled from office, dismissing the proceedings only after determining that a Senator is not a \"civil officer of the United States\". In 1876, William W. Belknap was impeached by the House of Representatives hours after resigning as United States Secretary of War. The Senate held by a 37–29 vote that it had jurisdiction to try Belknap notwithstanding his resignation, but ultimately acquitted him after trial.[8] The permissibility of trying a former official was a major issue in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, which commenced twenty days after Trump's term in office expired, although Trump's impeachment itself occurred while he was president. By a 55–45 vote, the Senate rejected a motion asserting that the trial was unconstitutional.[9]\n\nThe Constitution does not limit the number of times an individual may be impeached. As of 2025, Donald Trump is the only federal officer to have been impeached more than once.\n\nAt the federal level, the impeachment process is typically a three-step procedure. The first phase is typically an impeachment inquiry, though this is not a required stage.[10] The two stages constitutionally required for removal are impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial by the United States Senate.\n\nImpeachment proceedings may be requested by a member of the House of Representatives, either by presenting a list of the charges under oath or by asking for referral to the appropriate committee. The impeachment process may be requested by non-members. For example, when the Judicial Conference of the United States suggests a federal judge be impeached, a charge of actions constituting grounds for impeachment may come from a special prosecutor, the president, or state or territorial legislature, grand jury, or by petition. An impeachment proceeding formally begins with a resolution adopted by the full House of Representatives.[10]\n\nAn impeachment resolution may first pass through a House committee before the full House votes on it.[10] The type of impeachment resolution determines the committee to which it is referred. A resolution impeaching a particular individual is typically referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. A resolution to authorize an investigation regarding impeachable conduct is referred to the House Committee on Rules, and then to the Judiciary Committee. The House Committee on the Judiciary, by majority vote, will determine whether grounds for impeachment exist (this vote is not law and is not required, US Constitution and US law).\n\nEither as part of the impeachment resolution or separately specific grounds and allegations of for impeachment will be outlined in one or more articles of impeachment.\n\nThe House debates the resolution and may at the conclusion consider the resolution as a whole or vote on each article of impeachment individually. A simple majority of those present and voting is required for each article for the resolution as a whole to pass. If the House votes to impeach, managers (typically referred to as \"House managers\", with a \"lead House manager\") are selected to present the case to the Senate. Recently, managers have been selected by resolution, while historically the House would occasionally elect the managers or pass a resolution allowing the appointment of managers at the discretion of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. These managers are roughly the equivalent of the prosecution or district attorney in a standard criminal trial. Also, the House will adopt a resolution in order to notify the Senate of its action. After receiving the notice, the Senate will adopt an order notifying the House that it is ready to receive the managers. The House managers then appear before the bar of the Senate and exhibit the articles of impeachment. After the reading of the charges, the managers return and make a verbal report to the House.[citation needed]\n\nSenate rules call for an impeachment trial to begin at 1 pm on the day after articles of impeachment are delivered to the Senate, except for Sundays. There is no timeframe requirement for when the managers must actually deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate. On the set date, senators are sworn in for the impeachment trial.[14]\n\nThe proceedings take the form of a trial, with the Senate having the right to call witnesses and each side having the right to perform cross-examinations.[15] The House members, who are given the collective title of managers during the trial, present the prosecution case, and the impeached official has the right to mount a defense with his or her own attorneys as well. Senators must also take an oath or affirmation that they will perform their duties honestly and with due diligence. After hearing the charges, the Senate usually deliberates in private. The Constitution requires a two-thirds supermajority to convict a person being impeached.[16] The Senate enters judgment on its decision, whether that be to convict or acquit, and a copy of the judgment is filed with the Secretary of State.[15]\n\nUpon conviction in the Senate, the official is automatically removed from office and may by a separate vote also be barred from holding future office. The Senate trial is not an actual criminal proceeding and more closely resembles a civil service termination appeal in terms of the contemplated deprivation. Therefore, the removed official may still be liable to criminal prosecution under a subsequent criminal proceeding. The president may not grant a pardon in the impeachment case, but may in any resulting federal criminal case (unless it is the president who is convicted and thus loses the pardon power). However, whether the president can self-pardon for criminal offenses is an open question, which has never been reviewed by a court.[17][failed verification – see discussion]\n\nBeginning in the 1980s with Harry E. Claiborne, the Senate began using \"Impeachment Trial Committees\" pursuant to Senate Rule XI.[15] These committees presided over the evidentiary phase of the trials, hearing the evidence and supervising the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The committees would then compile the evidentiary record and present it to the Senate; all senators would then have the opportunity to review the evidence before the chamber voted to convict or acquit. The purpose of the committees was to streamline impeachment trials, which otherwise would have taken up a great deal of the chamber's time. Defendants challenged the use of these committees, claiming them to be a violation of their fair trial rights as this did not meet the constitutional requirement for their cases to be \"tried by the Senate\". Several impeached judges, including District Court Judge Walter Nixon, sought court intervention in their impeachment proceedings on these grounds. In Nixon v. United States (1993),[18] the Supreme Court determined that the federal judiciary could not review such proceedings, as matters related to impeachment trials are political questions and could not be resolved in the courts.[19]\n\nIn the case of impeachment of the president, the chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial. During the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, some Senate Republicans argued that the chief justice was required to preside, even though Trump was no longer the president when the trial began. However, by a 55–45 vote, the Senate rejected a motion asserting that the trial was unconstitutional.[9] The trial was presided over by president pro tempore Patrick Leahy.\n\nThe Constitution is silent about who would preside in the case of the impeachment of a vice president. It is doubtful the vice president would be permitted to preside over their own trial.[citation needed] As president of the Senate, the vice president would preside over other impeachments. If the vice president did not preside over an impeachment (of anyone besides the president), the duties would fall to the president pro tempore of the Senate.\n\nTo convict an accused, \"the concurrence of two thirds of the [senators] present\" for at least one article is required. If there is no single charge commanding a \"guilty\" vote from two-thirds of the senators present, the defendant is acquitted and no punishment is imposed.\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Senate trial for the Impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security, ended after the Senate dismissed the accusations by agreeing to a point of order that the articles of impeachment did not comply with the United States Constitution.[20] The majority of the Senate ruled that the articles accusing Mayorkas of willfully and systematically refusing to comply with Federal immigration laws and breaching the public trust did not \"allege conduct that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor\".[21]\n\nConviction immediately removes the defendant from office. Following the vote on conviction, the Senate may by a separate vote also bar the individual from holding future federal office, elected or appointed. As the threshold for disqualification is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, the Senate has taken the position that disqualification votes only require a simple majority rather than a two-thirds supermajority. The Senate has used disqualification sparingly, as only three individuals (West Hughes Humphreys, Robert W. Archbald, and Thomas Porteous) have been disqualified from holding future office.[22][23][24]\n\nConviction does not extend to further punishment, for example, loss of pension. After conviction by the Senate, \"the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law\"[25] in the regular federal or state courts. However, the Former Presidents Act of 1958, which provides a pension and other benefits, does not extend to presidents who were removed from office following an impeachment conviction. Because of an amendment to that law in 2013, a former president who has been removed from office due to impeachment and conviction is still guaranteed lifetime Secret Service protection.[26]\n\nState legislatures can impeach state officials, including governors and judicial officers, in every state.[27][28] The court for the trial of impeachments may differ somewhat from the federal model—in New York, for instance, the Assembly (lower house) impeaches, and the State Senate tries the case, but the members of the seven-judge New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest, constitutional court) sit with the senators as jurors as well.[29] Impeachment and removal of governors has happened occasionally throughout the history of the United States, usually for corruption charges. At least eleven U.S. state governors have faced an impeachment trial; a twelfth, Governor Lee Cruce of Oklahoma, escaped impeachment by one vote in 1912. Several others, including Missouri's Eric Greitens in 2018, have resigned rather than face impeachment, when events seemed to make it inevitable.[30] The most recent impeachment of a state governor occurred on January 14, 2009, when the Illinois House of Representatives voted 117–1 to impeach Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges;[31] he was subsequently removed from office and barred from holding future office by the Illinois Senate on January 29.\n\nIn addition, the legislatures of the territories of American Samoa,[32] Northern Mariana Islands,[33] and Puerto Rico have impeachment powers.[34]\n\nThe procedure for impeachment, or removal, of local officials varies widely. For instance, in New York a mayor can be removed directly by the governor \"upon being heard\" on charges—the law makes no further specification of what charges are necessary or what the governor must find in order to remove a mayor.\n\nIn 2018, the entire Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia was impeached, something that has been often threatened, but had never happened before.\n\nMost states follow the same model as the United States federal government of having the lower chamber of their legislatures hold a vote to \"impeach\", thereby triggering an impeachment trial held in the upper chamber of their legislatures. However, several states do differ from the convention of holding the impeachment trial in the state legislature's upper chamber. In a reverse, in Alaska it is the upper chamber of the legislature that votes to impeach while the lower chamber acts as the court of impeachment.[27] In Missouri, after the lower chamber votes to impeach, an impeachment trial is held before the Supreme Court of Missouri, except for members of that court or for governors, whose impeachments are to be tried by a panel of seven judges (requiring a vote of five judges to convict), with the members of the panel being selected by the upper legislative chamber, the Missouri State Senate.[35] In Nebraska, which has a unicameral legislature, after the Nebraska Legislature votes to impeach, an impeachment trial takes place before the Nebraska Supreme Court.[27] In addition to all the members of its upper chamber, the state of New York's Court of the Trial of Impeachments also includes all seven members of the state's highest court, the New York Court of Appeals.[36]\n\nOther governments and organizations in the United States also utilize impeachment.\n\nMany tribal governments have impeachment, with tribes generally utilizing a similar bifurcated process to the federal government, having an impeachment vote followed by an impeachment trial.[37] Examples of tribal governments that have an impeachment process include the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation[38] Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation,[39] Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians,[40] and Oglala Sioux.[41][42]\n\nThe Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) Confederacy's Great Law of Peace, which predates the constitution of the United States, includes what amounts to an impeachment process through which clan mothers can remove and replace a sachem for misdeeds. This is unique in that only a tribe's women are allowed to remove a sachem through this process.[43][44]\n\nA notable Native impeachment attempt was the 1975 effort to impeach Dick Wilson as chairman of the Oglala of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. This immediately preceded the Wounded Knee Occupation.[45]\n\nExamples of Native tribal officials that were impeached include:\n\nSome municipal governments currently or previously have had to power to impeach municipal officials such as mayors.[59] Cities where municipal governments allow impeachment proceedings include cities such as Houston, Texas.[60][61] An example of an impeachment by a municipal government is that of Philip Tomppert, who was removed through impeachment as the mayor of Louisville, Kentucky by the Louisville Board of Aldermen (city council) in 1865.[62]\n\nThere are other organizations in the United States that have impeachment procedures, including students' union (\"student government\"/\"student council\") organizations.[63]\n\nSeveral of the Thirteen Colonies belonging to England that later formed the original states of the United States of America held impeachments. Impeachment was a process carried over from England. Unlike in modern America, but similarly to the practice of impeachment in England, in at least some colonies impeachment was a process that could also be used to try non-officeholders and give criminal penalties.[64] However, in practice, the colonies primarily limited their impeachments to officeholders and punishment to removal from office. Most charges in impeachments were related to misconduct in office.[65] Impeachments in the colonies used a similar bifurcated process to the common modern practice of an impeachment vote followed by an impeachment trial.[64][65] Like the English impeachment practice and modern United States federal impeachment practice, the charges would be brought by a colonial legislature's lower chamber and tried in its upper chamber.[65]\n\nSome states were independent governments before being admitted into the United States. In Vermont, some impeachments took place prior to its statehood.[66][67]\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States government.",

    "fullText": "Welcome! MySQL for Developers is PlanetScale’s free MySQL course that teaches you schema basics, indexing, querying, and beyond. This intermediate MySQL course is appropriate for both developers just getting started with MySQL and those who need a refresher. The course has been created with usability and application in mind. Everything you learn in this course can be taken and applied to your own applications to make them faster and more efficent.\n\nWe’ll be breaking the course down into several sections, starting with the schema and covering everything from data types to indexes, to querying, and much more.\n\nIn the first section of the course, we’re going to start by looking at schema basics. What makes an effective table? How do different data types in MySQL work? When should you use one type over another? We’ll also look at the drawbacks of certain data types and how to avoid them while building a schema. This is the foundation for the rest of the course, so make sure you understand these concepts before moving on to more advanced topics.\n\nIn the next section of the course, we’ll cover indexing in depth. What is an index, and why is it so fast? How can we make the most of it when building our schema? We’ll cover all of these questions and \n\nIn the third section of the course, we’ll cover querying. How do we write efficient and effective MySQL queries? How do we use the indexes we built earlier to make our queries super fast? This section builds on everything we’ve covered in the previous sections, so make sure you have a strong foundation before attempting it.\n\nIn the final section of the course, we’ll take everything we’ve learned and put it together into a series of examples that application developers often encounter. By the end of this section, you’ll have a deep understanding of how to build efficient and effective MySQL databases that work well for your applications.\n\nThis course is designed specifically for developers, so no prior knowledge of databases is required. We won’t be covering low-level details or administration, as this course is focused on how to use MySQL effectively as an application developer. If you’ve found databases intimidating in the past, don’t worry—we’ll take it step by step, and you’ll be an expert user by the end of the course.\n\nThroughout the course, we’ll be using a TablePlus client on my Mac to run queries and view results. You’ll see me on screen sometimes, and most of the time, I’ll be up in the corner while we look at the TablePlus client. We won’t be using a lot of slides, as I know they can be boring. Instead, we’ll be getting hands-on and looking at actual tables, queries, indexes, and more within the TablePlus client.\n\nThis course covers everything you need to know to become an expert user of MySQL as a developer. We’ll start with the basics of schema and data types, move on to indexing and querying, and finish up with real-world examples. By the end of the course, you’ll have a deep understanding of how to build efficient and effective MySQL databases that work well for your applications. I hope you enjoy the course and learn a lot!\n\nFeedback or questions? Reach out to our team at education@planetscale.com.",

    "fullText": "Dearborn, Michigan — In a striking signal that one of America’s oldest and most iconic automakers is recalibrating its future, Ford Authority reports that CEO Jim Farley has openly stated that Ford will not try to make cars for everyone. Instead of pursuing a broad strategy that caters to all segments of the market, the company under Farley’s leadership is narrowing its focus to areas of strength like trucks, commercial vehicles and select electrified models, even if it means retreating from certain all-electric ambitions.\n\nFarley’s comments reflect a broader strategic pivot away from the aggressive electric vehicle push that Ford once championed. Earlier this year, Ford had touted the F-150 Lightning electric pickup as a centerpiece for its battery-electric future. That plan has since been upended, with production of the all-electric Lightning ending in 2025. This decision accompanies a massive $19.5 billion charge tied to restructuring its EV business, primarily Model e, the division responsible for electric vehicles. This writedown underscores real financial pain from years of heavy investment without corresponding profits.\n\nThe shift comes as consumer demand for expensive EVs remains weak, particularly at price points above $50,000. Farley and other Ford executives have signaled that much of the company’s cash-burning electric lineup simply did not sell in volume and that the market’s adoption curve for EVs has been flatter than anticipated. Instead, Ford plans to reallocate investment toward hybrid vehicles, extended-range electrics, and more traditionally profitable trucks like the F-150 and commercial vans.\n\nThis change of direction also has real human and industrial consequences. In Kentucky, a battery plant built for EV production laid off all 1,600 workers as part of the shift away from manufacturing electric cars. Ford, however, is looking to refit this facility for battery storage products and other energy solutions to serve data centers and infrastructure projects. This move reflects a belief that the Blue Oval’s future lie within and beyond automotive assembly.\n\nDespite these shifts, Ford won’t dare abandon electrification entirely. The company is still developing vehicles on its Universal EV Platform, a modular architecture designed to support a range of smaller and more affordable electric models. The timeline for profitability in the EV business has been pushed out to 2029, a slower trajectory than originally envisioned, but one that executives reckon is more realistic given current market dynamics.",

    "fullText": "During the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, the company’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, threw steel balls at the truck to demonstrate its sturdiness, but instead shattered two windows. In an interview, von Holzhausen said the mishap became a “great marketing moment.” Tesla began selling T-shirts alluding to the accident, and CEO Elon Musk claimed the company saw 200,000 orders for Cybertrucks in the days following its launch.\n\nSome may call Franz von Holzhausen’s accidental destruction of a Tesla Cybertruck window a blunder; von Holzhausen would prefer to call it a “great meme” instead.\n\nDuring the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, von Holzhausen, the company’s chief designer, threw steel balls at the vehicle, intending to demonstrate the windows CEO Elon Musk that said were made of “armor glass” were indeed extra tough. The windows, however, unexpectedly shattered, leaving Musk to deliver the rest of his presentation of the new truck while standing in front of the damaged car. Tesla’s stock fell more than 5% the next day.\n\nWhile the incident seemed like an omen, indicative of the Cybertruck being poised to fail, the botched demonstration actually opened up an opportunity to give the new model a spotlight, von Holzhausen said in an interview with Tesla Club Austria published earlier this year.\n\n“It was just one of those Murphy’s Law kind of things where something bad happens, but it turned out to be a great meme,” von Holzhausen said, referring to the phenomenon of when something can go wrong, it usually will. “And I think in an odd sort of way—we don’t do marketing—but it turned into a great marketing moment.”\n\nHe added, “It was not an expected moment, but in that moment, you have to roll with it.”\n\nFollowing the reveal of the vehicle, Musk posted a video on X of von Holzhausen throwing a steel ball at the model Cybertruck before its launch, with its windows withstanding the force of the throw with no visible damage. The video was viewed more than 6 million times within three days of its posting.\n\n“Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha,” Musk wrote.\n\nDays later, Musk touted the success of the Cybertruck launch, saying Tesla had received more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle. While Tesla does not break out Cybertruck numbers when it reports earnings, instead grouping them with the Model S and X, the company recalled nearly all of the Cybertrucks it had on the road earlier this year due to an issue in which an exterior panel could become detached, and that only tallied around 46,000 vehicles.",

Half of retirees 75 and over have less than $130,000 saved—a figure that doesn't stretch far when you factor in rising medical costs, inflation, and daily living expenses.\n\nIn fact, according to Fidelity, older Americans should aim to have around 10 times their pre-retirement income saved by age 67 to maintain their standard of living. The gap between that target and actual savings underscores why many retirees are left navigating tough financial choices.\n\nAnd it's not just about individual effort. According to a 2024 report from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, an estimated 39% of working households are projected to fall short of maintaining their pre-retirement standard of living.

    "fullText": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded with sharp criticism to Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands for new elections in his country.\n\n\"It is not for Putin to decide when and in what format elections take place in Ukraine,\" he said at a press conference in Kiev during a visit by Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro. He promised that Putin would not be able to influence a possible vote on the future Ukrainian president.\n\nThe criticism was triggered by Putin's statements on Friday at his annual press conference, where he not only once again demanded presidential elections in the neighbouring country he invaded and criticized the current Ukrainian leadership as illegitimate, but also insisted that Ukrainians living in Russia should participate in the vote.\n\nPutin said there are between 5 million and 10 million Ukrainians in Russia. There are no diplomatic missions of Ukraine in Russia, where citizens abroad would normally vote. Putin's election official, Ella Pamfilova, said that the Russian authorities could organize the voting there.\n\nNo elections in Russia and occupied territories\n\n\"Ukrainian citizens who are in Ukraine in the Ukrainian-controlled areas will vote,\" Zelensky said in response.\n\nOnly there could honest and transparent elections be guaranteed, he said. In addition, there is the usual practice of voting in foreign missions.\n\n\"In the areas not controlled by Ukraine, no elections can be held because it is clear that they would be conducted there as Russia always does,\" he said, referring to international criticism of the questionable fairness of elections in Russia.\n\nMartial law prohibits elections during wartime\n\nPutin, who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has repeatedly stated since last year that Zelensky is no longer legitimate due to his expired term.\n\nKiev, however, points to martial law, which prohibits elections during wartime, thereby extending Zelensky's term. Internationally, Zelensky is still recognized as the Ukrainian president.\n\nRecently, however, US President Donald Trump adopted Putin's demand for new elections in Ukraine. Zelensky expressed his willingness to do so but demanded a ceasefire during the election to ensure the security of the vote.\n\nPutin's re-election in March 2024 was also sharply criticized as illegitimate in Western countries. The German government, for instance, classified the vote as \"neither free nor fair.\"\n\nReal opposition candidates were not allowed, there was a climate of intimidation, and there is no freedom of expression, said the then spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann.

    "title": "Comet 3I/Atlas Is Emitting A Radio Signal - Here's What We Know",
    "description": "Scientists have sought out and detected radio emissions from from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming what most scientists have been thinking.",
    "fullText": "The most sensational story of the year for astronomers has been the discovery of the comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed on July 1, 2025 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Although comets regularly pass by Earth, the most famous being Halley's Comet, there's something extra-special about this new find. Halley's and other well-known comets originated within our solar system, birthed from the same planet-forming disk that the sun, Earth, and all the other planets emerged from. What makes 3I/ATLAS so fascinating is that it originated somewhere beyond the solar system, and made its way here through interstellar space. As if that weren't an exciting enough discovery, a radio telescope has noticed that the comet is emitting something.\n\nThe MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa picked up on 3I/ATLAS in late October, as the comet was nearing its closest point to the sun. This finding was widely reported as radio signals emitting from 3I/ATLAS, which prompted conspiracy theorists to speculate that the object may actually be a piece of alien technology. This isn't quite accurate though. Technically, everything gives off electromagnet radiation, and what MeerKAT found wasn't an audio transmission like the kind we hear on a car radio. What it actually found were gaps in the radio spectrum caused by the absorption of radio waves by OH molecules, also known as hydroxyl radicals. OH molecules — the remnants of water torn apart by solar radiation — are regularly observed in comets that pass within range of Earth, which seemingly puts to bed any speculation that the 3I/ATLAS is anything other than a comet. However, it doesn't answer the question of where 3I/ATLAS originated from.\n\nThe discovery of 3I/ATLAS marked just the third time that astronomers have observed an interstellar object passing through our solar system. The \"3I\" in its name actually stands for \"third interstellar\" for this reason. The previous two interstellar objects observed by astronauts were 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2017 and 2019 respectively. The fact that all known interstellar visitors to our solar system were discovered in the past decade is a sign of great strides in astronomical technology, but it also means that we have been able to gather very little data thus far about interstellar comets. One thing does stand out, however. Both 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov came from the direction of the Milky Way's center, but 3I/ATLAS is coming from a perpendicular angle.\n\nBased on the trajectory, it's likely that the comet originated in a part of the galaxy that astronomers haven't even observed yet. NASA is gathering images of 3I/ATLAS, as is the European Space Agency, and both expect to have more satellite and probe data ready to analyze by early 2026; however, it is highly unlikely that we'll ever be able to pinpoint the exact origin of the comet. While scientists don't know where it came from, they do have a good idea of where 3I/ATLAS is going, and you can rest assured that it won't hit Earth. In fact, the comet won't even come as close to us as the sun is.\n\nThe intrusion of an interstellar object into our solar system immediately caught the attention of every alien enthusiast out there, and not just the typical podcast conspirators. A professor at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics is arguing that 3I/ATLAS could be a piece of alien technology. Professor Avi Loeb has published numerous articles about the interstellar object on his blog, going against the consensus of his peers in the scientific community. He argues that 3I/ATLAS exhibits several anomalies compared to the previous two interstellar comets that have been tracked through our solar system. Compared to that pair, 3I/ATLAS is far more massive, yet moves faster. He also notes that the gas plume surrounding 3I/ATLAS contains similar levels of nickel to industrial alloys.\n\nThe recently recorded radio signals from 3I/ATLAS are yet another dent in Loeb's theory, which has been roundly rebuked by other astrophysicists. Counterarguments point out that comets often show inconsistent features. It's impossible to say what is normal and what is anomalous, and that is especially true in the case of interstellar comets. Loeb actually hits the nail on the head in an article titled, The Tale of 3I/ATLAS and Sterile Neutrinos, wherein he asks, \"How can anyone claim to be an expert of interstellar objects when the sample size includes only two previously known examples?\" In all likelihood, many of our questions about 3I/ATLAS won't be answerable until we have observed other interstellar comets in the future.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Residents of a neighborhood in Singapore are on high alert after a venomous snake was spotted in a playground.\n\nAccording to Must Share News, the scaly interloper was found in a children's play area in  Sembawang, a suburban town in Singapore's north region. It was identified as a black spitting cobra (Naja sumatrana), not to be mistaken for its similarly-named cousin, the black-necked spitting cobra (Naja nigricollis).\n\nThe sighting was reported to the authorities, but the animal had slithered away before it could be safely removed from the park. Residents were concerned about the danger the snake could have posed to children. Some were also worried about the park's cats and those who feed the stray felines.\n\nChelsia Lee, who shared the images on social media covered by Must Share News, told the outlet, \"I hope feeders will be more alert during this period when most snakes are likely to come out to seek warmth from the cold weather.\"\n\nAlso known as the Equatorial spitting cobra, the snake is known for its primary defense mechanism: spitting venom into the eyes of attackers. Some species can hit their mark from a range of two meters with startling accuracy, so it's definitely not a good idea to get too close.\n\nHowever, the main danger comes from its bite. While fatalities are extremely rare, they have occurred, and those with underlying health issues are at greater risk.\n\nAs development expands, with construction often pushing into green spaces, human-wildlife conflicts are more likely to occur. Moreover, as natural habitats are destroyed and food and water become scarcer, previously unobserved species may be forced into residential areas.\n\nIn most instances, and certainly with the black spitting cobra, the animals don't truly mean any harm to people and will only attack if they feel threatened. Indeed, snakes can play an important role in controlling rodent populations and reducing the spread of vector-borne diseases.\n\nIt's typically a matter of raising awareness and informing loved ones about sensible precautions to take in an urban wildlife encounter. In the vast majority of cases, simply keeping your distance and being aware of your surroundings is more than enough to stay safe.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Scientists watching the nearby Fomalhaut star system have directly seen two protoplanets smash together for the first time. Then, they saw it happen again.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAstronomers hoping to observe a planet around a nearby star have witnessed a much rarer \"unprecedented celestial event,\" the team said: The violent aftermath of not one, but two collisions between the rocky building blocks of planets.\n\nOver the past two decades, astronomers witnessed two separate catastrophic collisions around the star Fomalhaut, located just 25 light-years away in the constellation Piscis Austrinus. The detections occurred after planetesimals (rocky pieces of unformed planets) measuring much larger than the dinosaur-killing asteroid smashed each other into massive clouds of glittering debris.\n\nThe Fomalhaut system is no stranger to such crashes. It's famously known as the \"Eye of Sauron\" due to its resemblance to the fiery, all-seeing eye from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of The Rings franchise. The likeness comes from the spectacular dust belt that surrounds Fomalhaut at a distance of 133 astronomical units (AU), with one AU being equal to 93 million miles (150 million km) — the average distance between the sun and Earth.\n\nFormed from countless rocky, icy collisions, this belt of dust and debris provides a dustier analog of our early solar system as it appeared more than 4 billion years ago, the team said — offering a glimpse of our neighborhood's chaotic infancy, when planets were being created, destroyed, and reassembled.\n\nA new study, conducted by an international team of researchers and led by Paul Kalas, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, described these two collision events in destructive detail to help solve a planetary mystery.\n\nIn the early 2000s, astronomers observing the Fomalhaut system spotted a large, luminous object that many assumed to be a dust-covered exoplanet reflecting light. They designated this exoplanet candidate Fomalhaut b.\n\nYet when this supposed planet blinked out of existence and another bright point of light appeared nearby, all in the span of approximately 20 years, researchers realized they weren't viewing planets, but the shining debris clouds formed by what they call a \"cosmic fender bender.\"\n\nThe two collision events, now known as Fomalhaut cs1 and Fomalhaut cs2, appear to be incredibly serendipitous. Theory suggests that collisions of this size should only happen once every 100,000 years or so, but the Fomalhaut system surprised scientists with two such smash-ups in just 20 years.\n\nIndeed, based on this timeline, the study infers that 22 million similar events may have occurred during the Fomalhaut system's relatively young, 440-million-year-old life so far. Even if one could rewind only the past 3,000 years or so, \"Fomalhaut's planetary system would be sparkling with these collisions,\" Kalas explained in a statement.\n\nReverse engineering the collisions based on factors like the mass of the debris clouds and the size of the dust grains suggests that Fomalhaut cs1 and cs2 were the result of colliding planetesimals around 37 miles (60 km) in diameter, or around four to six times the size of the asteroid that devastated the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\n\nIt's an alien event with a relatable twist: \"These larger bodies are like the larger bodies that comprise our own asteroid and Kuiper belts,\" study co-author Jason Wang, an astronomer at Northwestern University, told Live Science via email.\n\nAnd there are a lot of these bodies. Based on their reconstruction of the event, the researchers suggest that the Fomalhaut system may host 1.8 Earth masses of these primordial planetesimals. This may amount to about 300 million such bodies, according to a separate statement.\n\nFurthermore, the system holds another 1.8 Earth masses in smaller bodies measuring less than 0.186 miles (0.3 kilometers) across. These relative runts constantly replenish the tiny dust grains, many just a few 10,000ths of an inch in size, that swirl and shimmer in Fomalhaut's dust belt. Without this rocky reservoir, the dust belt would disappear as its grains are blown out of the system by stellar wind or engulfed by its star.\n\nEven though Fomalhaut b no longer exists — as a planet, at least — this \"planet that never was\" may actually still be hiding within the system.\n\nResearchers calculated that, given the specific conditions, there's about a 10% chance that Fomalhaut cs1 and cs2 are not random collisions. Their similar timing and location may point to a hidden influence, such as the ghostly gravitational pull of an unseen exoplanet.\n\n\"For example, something — like planets — should be responsible for carving out the planetesimals into a dust belt that we see,\" Wang told LiveScience. \"Additionally, we speculate that the proximity in location of the cs1 and cs2 impact sites may be driven by a planet that preferentially causes planetesimals to collide there.\"\n\nThis exoplanetary confusion highlights an important consideration for planet-hunters, and for next-generation facilities like NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory that are designed to directly image habitable-zone exoplanets in the nearby universe: \"Fomalhaut cs2 looks exactly like an extrasolar planet reflecting starlight,\" explained Kalas.\n\nAs a result, this unique study not only informs our ideas about planetary formation, such as collision rates and debris belt mechanics, but can also help astronomers more precisely identify planetary bodies from among all the other shining celestial objects with which the universe continually dazzles us.",

    "title": "'I'm a Gastroenterologist—This Is the One Snack I Wish Everyone Would Avoid'",
    "description": "Plus, see their zero-prep, gut-approved snack recommendations.",
    "fullText": "For most people, wanting a snack at least once during the day is inevitable. Even if you eat a hearty breakfast and lunch, it’s bound to happen. Sometimes we crave snacks because we’re truly hungry. Other times, we might be bored, stressed or just want something to munch on.\n\nIt’s certainly not unhealthy to have a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack, even if it’s something you do every day. In fact, an article published in the International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition says that having one to two snacks a day can be even more nutritious than having three meals a day and no snacks. This is because having a snack or two throughout the day can prevent overeating at meals, which puts less stress on the digestive and metabolic systems.\n\nOf course, it all comes down to what you decide to snack on. We asked three gastroenterologists for their recommendations on what snacks to eat—and which snacks to avoid—when it comes to snacking for gut health. Keep reading to find out what they said.\n\n“As a gastroenterologist, the one snack I’d love people to step away from is ultra-processed chips, [specifically] fried chips that come in crinkly bags with a long ingredients list that includes refined starches, industrial oils, artificial flavors, ‘cheese powders’ and preservatives,” says Dr. Jason Korenblit, MD, a gastroenterologist and digestive expert with Just Answer.\n\nDr. Korenblit explains that chips are a textbook example of an ultra-processed food, which he says can negatively impact gut health. “Diets high in ultra-processed foods are consistently linked with worse gut health, inflammatory bowel disease, IBS and colorectal cancer as well as obesity, diabetes and heart disease,” he says.\n\nHe explains that if someone eats chips once in a while, it’s not that big a deal. But if someone eats chips every day, it’s going to negatively impact the gut in a few ways.\n\n“Your gut bacteria live on fiber and resistant starch, the parts of plant foods we don’t fully digest. When you mostly snack on chips, which are nearly fiber-free, you’re feeding you but not them. High-fiber diets, in contrast, support diverse, resilient microbiota and production of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, which reduce inflammation and strengthen the gut barrier,” Dr. Korenblit says, adding that snacking on nutrient-void chips over time can lead to less beneficial gut bacteria and increase inflammation (caused by the high-frying temperatures, which create inflammation-causing compounds).\n\n“Emerging data suggests that some emulsifiers and additives can disrupt the mucus layer that protects the intestinal wall and alter the microbiome in ways that promote inflammation and increased gut permeability,” he continues, adding that this is associated with IBS. “That doesn’t mean one serving of chips ‘destroys your gut,’ but regular exposure may nudge the system toward low-grade inflammation over years,” he says.\n\nPairing your chips with soda can negatively impact the gut even more. “I wish we could eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages,” says Dr. Trisha Pasricha, MD, MPH, an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, director of the Institute for Gut-Brain Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and author of the upcoming book, You’ve Been Pooping All Wrong, saying that they have been identified as a risk factor for early-onset colorectal cancer.\n\n🩺\nIf you want to support your gut, it’s clear that having a daily snack of chips and soda is out. What should you snack on instead? Dr. Paul Feuerstadt, MD, FACG, AGAF, a gastroenterologist, member of the board of directors at the Peggy Lillis Foundation and an associate clinical professor at Yale School of Medicine, recommends choosing unprocessed foods that are high in fiber.\n\nFor example, some snacks that Dr. Feuerstadt recommends are nuts, berries and legume-based snacks, like hummus or crunchy chickpeas. He explains that these snacks support gut health in their own unique ways, including by upping the amount of diverse and beneficial bacteria in the gut.\n\n“Personally, I keep a jar of almonds in my office. Nuts are high in protein and fiber, so they keep you satisfied and nourished,” Dr. Pasricha says.\n\nDr. Feuerstadt and Dr. Korenblit agree that yogurt is a great gut-healthy snack too, due to its high probiotic content.\n\n“Yogurt with live and active cultures provides beneficial bacteria, aka probiotics, that can help support a healthy microbiome and may reduce inflammation and dysbiosis [imbalance]. Regular yogurt intake has been associated with favorable shifts in gut microbes and lower risk of certain colorectal cancers,” Dr. Korenblit says, explaining that pairing your yogurt with nuts and berries provides additional gut-supporting benefits. He adds that it also makes the yogurt more satiating, due to the unsaturated fats, fiber and protein.\n\nSupporting your gut health through your snack choice doesn’t mean eating “perfectly” or never enjoying chips, soda, or other ultra-processed foods and drinks.\n\n“Don’t aim for perfection. Aim for building a healthier eating pattern. Your health is going to see greater gains if you make changes that you actually enjoy and can stick with for years, rather than changes you hate and quit after two intense and horrible weeks,” Dr. Pasicha says.\n\nTo make healthy snacking easier, stock your kitchen with nutrient-rich, grab-and-go options the experts shared earlier, like yogurt, berries, nuts, crunchy chickpeas or hummus and veggies. Not only will you be supporting your gut, but you’ll feel more satiated than you would after eating a handful of chips.\n\nDr. Jason Korenblit, MD, gastroenterologist and digestive expert with Just Answer\n\nDr. Trisha Pasricha, MD, MPH, instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, director of the Institute for Gut-Brain Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and author of the upcoming book, You’ve Been Pooping All Wrong\n\nDr. Paul Feuerstadt, MD, FACG, AGAF, gastroenterologist who is a member of the board of directors at the Peggy Lillis Foundation and an associate clinical professor at Yale School of Medicine\n\nMarangoni, F., Martini, D., Scaglioni, S., et al.

    "fullText": "Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:\n\nA 31-year-old Pakistani man, who went missing in June 1997 in an ice cave, was found perfectly preserved by a local shepherd.\n\nThe discovery puts an end to a painful three-decade-long search for a family that tirelessly searched for his body in the mountainous Kohistan region.\n\nAs glaciers retreat around the world due to climate change, discoveries of bodies or ancient artifacts will likely increase as melting ice reveals their frozen tombs.\n\nIn June 1997, a 31-year-old Pakistani man by the name Naseeruddin, while traveling in the Supat Valley in the mountainous northern region of Pakistan called Kohistan, disappeared into a cave never to be seen again. He left behind a wife and two children, and for years, the family of the missing man searched the area for any sign of him—ultimately, to no avail.\n\n“Our family left no stone unturned to trace him over the years,” Malik Ubaid, the nephew of the deceased, told the AFP. “Our uncles and cousins visited the glacier several times to see if his body could be retrieved, but they eventually gave up as it wasn’t possible.”\n\nAfter nearly three decades, the search for Naseeruddin has finally come to an end. On July 31, a local shepherd in the valley named Omar Khan discovered the missing man’s body, with an identity card still on him. But that wasn’t the only surprise.\n\n“What I saw was unbelievable,” Khan told BBC Urdu. “The body was intact. The clothes were not even torn.”\n\nFor 28 years, Naseeruddin lay mummified in the glacial ice. He underwent a quick freezing process that then protected the body from moisture and oxygen. Pakistan is home to some 7,000 glaciers—the largest amount outside of Earth’s polar regions—and like many glaciers around the world, these ice giants are slowly disappearing due to anthropogenic climate change.\n\nIn northern Pakistan, climate change has caused decreased snowfall in the region, leading to more direct sunlight melting the glaciers. This unnatural warming is what eventually exposed Naseeruddin’s body, allowing the passing shepherd to finally put a painful mystery to rest.\n\n“Finally, we have got some relief after the recovery of his dead body,” Ubaid said.\n\nGlaciers and other icy bodies, such as ice sheets, are basically planetary time capsules. Scientists around the world frequently drill ice cores to measure past climactic events by analyzing trapped air bubbles, as well as the isotropic composition of the surrounding ice. They can also provide incredible glimpses into humanity’s past. While many amazing artifacts have been found encased in glacial ice, the most famous frozen finding is Ötzi, also known as The Iceman, who was found in the Italian Alps in 1991 with his soft tissues and organs intact. This discovery provided an unprecedented glimpse into life and times and neolithic Europe.\n\nWhile glaciers are amazing at preserving soft tissue (scientists even know what Ötzi’s last meal was), they aren’t as effective as cryogenic freezing, which can perfectly preserve an organism. This is why Ötzi, as well as other bodies of frozen WWI soldiers discovered in 2017, still show signs of decomposition and dehydration.\n\nSadly, Naseeruddin’s fate is one shared by many intrepid explorers who venture into these dangerous and cold altitudes. Last year, National Geographic reported the partial recovery of mountaineer Sandy Irvine, who disappeared on Everest a century ago. In fact, crews regularly conducted clean-up campaigns on the world’s tallest peak, often finding long-lost climbers frozen along the mountainside.\n\nWith glaciers rapidly in retreat around the world, we’ll soon see what other mysteries—both tragic and wondrous—that may lay hidden at the top of the world.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "World War II Navy veteran Ira “Ike” Schab, one of the dwindling number of survivors of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 105.\n\nDaughter Kimberlee Heinrichs told The Associated Press that Schab died at home early Saturday in the presence of her and her husband.\n\nWith his passing, there remain only about a dozen survivors of the surprise attack, which killed just over 2,400 troops and propelled the United States into the war.\n\nSchab was a sailor of just 21 at the time of the attack, and for decades he rarely spoke about the experience.\n\nBut in recent years, aware that the corps of survivors was dwindling, the centenarian made a point of traveling from his home in Beaverton, Oregon, to the annual observance at the Hawaii military base.\n\n“To pay honor to the guys that didn’t make it,” he said in 2023.\n\nFor last year's commemoration, Schab spent weeks building up the strength to be able to stand and salute.\n\nBut this year he did not feel well enough to attend, and less than three weeks later, he passed away.\n\nBorn on Independence Day in 1920 in Chicago, Schab was the eldest of three brothers.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 18, following in the footsteps of his father, he said in a February interview for Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nOn what began as a peaceful Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, Schab, who played the tuba in the USS Dobbin’s band, was expecting a visit from his brother, a fellow service member assigned to a nearby naval radio station. Schab had just showered and donned a clean uniform when he heard a call for fire rescue.\n\nHe went topside and saw another ship, the USS Utah, capsizing. Japanese planes roared through the air.\n\n“We were pretty startled. Startled and scared to death,” Schab recalled in 2023. “We didn’t know what to expect, and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it.”\n\nHe scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun above.\n\nHis ship lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action, and two died later of fragment wounds from a bomb that struck the stern. All had been manning an anti-aircraft gun.\n\nSchab spent most of the war with the Navy in the Pacific, going to the New Hebrides, now known as Vanuatu, and then the Mariana Islands and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nAfter the war he studied aerospace engineering and worked on the Apollo spaceflight program as an electrical engineer for General Dynamics, helping send astronauts to the moon.\n\nSchab's son also joined the Navy and is a retired commander.\n\nSpeaking at a 2022 ceremony, Schab asked people to honor those who served at Pearl Harbor.\n\n“Remember what they’re here for. Remember and honor those that are left. They did a hell of a job,” he said. “Those who are still here, dead or alive.”",

    "fullText": "Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning senior reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia.\n\nThere are many problems billionaire tech tycoon Bill Gates is hoping to help solve: eradicating polio, water sanitization, and agricultural development to name a few. But one frontier he worries is being passed on to future generations is misinformation.\n\nMisinformation is a problem, the Microsoft cofounder said, that we are “handing to the younger generation.”\n\nSpeaking to CNBC Make It, Gates, worth $118 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said he had been naive to assume that “when we made information available, that people would want correct information.”\n\nA high-profile figure himself, Gates has seen scrutiny extend to his family. His daughter Phoebe, in particular, has struggled with being harassed online.\n\n“Hearing my daughter talk about how she’d been harassed online, and how her friends experienced that quite a bit, brought that into focus in a way that I hadn’t thought about before,” Gates—a father of three—continued.\n\nGates’ youngest daughter—co-founder of AI shopping tool Phia—has previously spoken about misconceptions surrounding her family and relationships, including being “memed for being in an interracial relationship.”\n\nAn internet meme is an image or video, usually intended to be humorous, that is spread online.\n\nDespite being aware of how misinformation is spreading online, Gates said he can understand why certain audiences flock to platforms that reflect their views—a phenomenon known as confirmation bias.\n\n“We have context where we want correct information, like hopefully when we want medical advice,” Gates said. “But then we kind of like, in our community and enclave, have these shared views that kind of pull us together.”\n\nHe explained: “Even I will wallow. Let’s say there’s a politician I don’t like, and there’s some article online criticizing him a little bit. I’m like, ‘Oh, that’s such a good critique, [and] I enjoyed reading it, even if it was exaggerated.’”\n\nGates’ probing questions about how to control the spread of incorrect information online may be at odds with the take of fellow billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nGates said in the interview: “We should have free speech. But if you’re inciting violence, if you’re causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries? Even the U.S. should have rules, and then if you have rules, what is it? Is it some AI that encodes those rules? You have billions in activity, and if you catch it a day later the harm is done.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Gates has proposed the emerging technology as a tool against misinformation and deepfakes (images and videos which are incredibly realistic but are not authentic).\n\nIn a blog post on his website, GatesNotes, in July 2023, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation cofounder wrote: “This will be a cyclical process: Someone finds a way to detect fakery, someone else figures out how to counter it, someone else develops counter-countermeasures, and so on.\n\n“It won’t be a perfect success, but we won’t be helpless either.”\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X—the platform previously known as Twitter—is a free-speech absolutist who is unlikely to appreciate the notion of rules being placed on what he, or others, can say.\n\nMusk believes freedom of speech is the “bedrock of democracy” and has vowed to battle apparent censorship of his platform.\n\nThat being said, a debate over how to control misinformation wouldn’t be the first time the views of Musk and Gates have been at odds. In July 2024, for example, Musk threatened Gates would be “obliterated” for apparently holding a bearish position on Tesla stock. Fortune could not confirm whether Gates still owns a short position on the EV maker.\n\nLikewise, Gates has said his management style is better than that of Musk—a boss he believes may push “too hard.” Meanwhile, Musk has claimed Gates doesn’t understand artificial intelligence, saying his insight on the topic is “limited.”\n\nMore recently, the tech titans have been at loggerheads over Musk’s work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE.) In January 2025, Gates said he hoped some of the foreign aid and personnel cuts enacted by DOGE would be rolled back: “Elon I think said ‘Yeah, we made a mistake, we went overboard,’ but … what is the equilibrium? How many of those people can be kept so we can continue to save tens of millions of lives?” Gates also accused Musk of some “insane” political interference in 2025.\n\nIn November, Musk revived the bad blood between the pair, writing on X that if Gates hadn’t closed out his alleged “crazy short position” against Tesla, “he had better do so soon.”\n\nIt seems misinformation may just be another of many topics on which the billionaires will have to agree to disagree.\n\nA version of this article was first published on September 5, 2024.",

    "fullText": "The United States is reviewing the social media accounts of some visa applicants, adding another hurdle for workers and other visitors to clear under the Trump administration.\n\nIt's also adding a hurdle for embassies processing those visa applications.\n\nThe State Department said in June that certain visa applicants would have their online activity vetted as part of its screening process. Six months later, the department expanded the list of visas that were subject to \"online presence reviews.\"\n\nThe new rule has complicated the visa application process, causing significant delays for approvals.\n\nThey have also rattled some companies, including Google and Apple, whose legal counsels have advised staffers requiring a visa stamp to re-enter the US not to leave the country due to extended processing times resulting from the new requirements.\n\nConsular offices began conducting online presence reviews for H-1B applicants on December 15, but they're not the only ones affected.\n\nEarlier this month, a State Department spokesperson told Business Insider that the US is requiring H-1B visa applicants and their dependents to make their social media accounts public so consular officers can review their activity.\n\nThe H-1B visa program enables companies to temporarily employ foreign skilled workers in specialized roles. Data collected from the Department of Labor showed that almost 50% of H-1B applications are in \"professional, scientific, and technical\" fields. They are commonly relied on in the tech industry.\n\nThe State Department said international students and exchange visitors are also subject to \"online presence\" reviews, specifically for F, M, and J non-immigrant visa applicants.\n\nIn its memo, Google's legal counsel told staffers that lengthy processing delays were affecting H-1B, H-4, F, J, and M visa holders.\n\nFederal agencies under President Donald Trump are enforcing stricter and more restrictive immigration policies.\n\nIn January, Trump issued an executive order aimed at enhancing immigration screening. It was meant to protect American citizens from those the administration says \"intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\"\n\nTrump expanded upon that executive order in June and then again this week. Combined, those subsequent orders partially or fully restrict entry for citizens from 25 countries.\n\nIn September, the Trump administration also began charging a $100,000 fee for new H-1B applications.\n\nIt cast the fee as a corrective. Trump said that the H-1B system had strayed from its original purpose of filling high-skilled worker shortages and was instead being \"deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\"\n\nIn its announcement about the social media checks on December 3, the State Department said the changes were meant to increase national security.\n\n\"A US visa is a privilege, not a right,\" a spokesperson for the State Department told Business Insider at the time. \"In every visa case, we will take the time necessary to ensure an applicant does not pose a risk to the safety and security of the United States.\"\n\nIt might be tempting to delete your social media accounts, but it's not that simple.\n\nThe law firm Davis Wright Tremaine advised in a post on its website that visa applicants should review their social media to ensure there is no information that might contradict the details submitted in their applications. The law firm Duane Morris advised against deleting posts or profiles. If an immigration official notices, it could be seen as evasive.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing a visa applicant can do is stay in the US during the process.\n\nShaun Foster, an immigration attorney who owns the firm PampaninFoster based in Cambridge, Mass., told Business Insider in a LinkedIn message that he is encouraging clients on H-1B visas to play it safe.\n\n\"We've continued to emphasize generally to stay in the US, and to keep moving forward in working toward your immigration goals from within the US,\" he wrote. \"We're much better positioned, as immigration counsel, to more strongly assist and guide people from within the US. There's less control when you start integrating international consular elements.\"\n\nLawyers for Google and Apple have already advised some employees on visas not to travel outside the US due to delays at embassies stemming from the increased scrutiny.\n\n\"Please be aware that some US Embassies and Consulates are experiencing significant visa stamping appointment delays, currently reported as up to 12 months,\" Google's legal counsel wrote in a memo sent on Thursday to employees on visas.\n\nFragomen, a law firm that represents Apple, similarly said in a memo sent last week to some visa holders at the company that they should refrain from travel.\n\n\"Given the recent updates and the possibility of unpredictable, extended delays when returning to the US, we strongly recommend that employees without a valid H-1B visa stamp avoid international travel for now,\" the memo said.\n\nBoth memos were seen by Business Insider.\n\nThose companies and many others are still smarting after Trump imposed the $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applicants in September.\n\nAfter that order, which initially didn't specify that it only applied to new applicants, human resources teams at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Salesforce, JPMorgan, and Zoom sent warnings to staffers advising them not to leave the US if they're on an H-1B visa.\n\nIn one case, dozens of H-1B holders on an Emirates flight out of San Francisco began deplaning as soon as they received the news alert.\n\nThe widespread panic in corporate America forced the Trump administration to clarify that the fee would only apply to new visa applicants, not existing visa holders.",

    "description": "I pushed myself so hard to make the holidays special when my kids were little. Now they are adults, and they are so much better.",
    "fullText": "My daughter-in-law called me recently to ask about Secret Santa. She was wondering if everyone would get involved, if I had any thoughts on stocking stuffers, and if there was anything in particular I might want, other than the Costco-sized jar of peanut M&Ms I had mentioned about 1,000 times.\n\nMy youngest son texted not long after to let me know he got three full days off for Christmas. He'll be bringing his cat for a visit. We'll all buy him cat treats. We will prepare casseroles and cookies, as well as overnight cinnamon rolls for the morning. We will wait to watch the main event, the Christmas movies, until we are all together.\n\nThis is my Christmas with adult kids. The kind of Christmas I dreaded when my four sons were little and I thought I had just those magical 18 holidays with them before it would all end.\n\nI thought those Christmases were the best I would ever see as a mom because I think that's the story we are sold. Christmas is for kids. It's better with kids. It's more fun, more magical, more everything. And I'll tell you that I really wrung every second of joy out of Christmas when my kids were little in an absolute panic of memory-making.\n\nI pushed the Santa agenda far longer than was socially acceptable. I baked every day, built gingerbread houses, and attended every Christmas concert. I bought the matching pajamas, I collected special ornaments and kept them in boxes for the boys to hang on our tree every year, no matter what.\n\nI think I idolized the holidays, like a good Christmas might make up for any other shortcomings during the rest of the year. I overlooked how tough it really was on me in favor of the good mom checkmark I might get at the end of it all.\n\nAnd it was hard on me. I can admit this finally. Not just because I was on my own with my sons or because we were living right around the poverty line. But because I genuinely believed that the only Christmases that mattered happened when my kids were little. It was like a Doomsday clock was ticking down on my every year, tied up with a neat red bow. I had to build memories for them at any cost so they would have happy childhood memories and not look back on our life together as a failure.\n\nI wish I could go back and talk to the stressed-out mom I was then. I would tell her that she could stop spending important January bill money on December toys. I would tell her that her kids will be OK. And yes, they want a few toys, but they will remember about one quarter of them by the next year.\n\nMost of all, I would tell her that she has way more fun holidays ahead than she thinks. I would even argue that Christmas with adult kids is better than it is with little kids. The pressure is off. Right or wrong, they are grown now. I don't have to keep any kind of special magic alive for them; they've seen behind the curtain, and they know I was back there all along.\n\nThey see me. They appreciate me. Best of all, they are back behind the curtain with me now, too. They provide, along with me, trips to the grocery store for forgotten spices, coffee cream, and extra napkins. They buy gifts and tell me not to worry about anything. They lighten my load. I'm no longer the keeper of Christmas; we all are. Bringing a different kind of magic to whatever days we might have together over the holidays.\n\nWe bring in the old traditions from when they were kids, but also leave the door open for new things. New recipes, new ideas on how to celebrate. Chinese takeout for Christmas Eve one year or homemade pizza, depending on everyone's work schedule. A little Baileys in our coffee while we open stockings. All of us together. The five of us, along with new partners, are perhaps the best Christmas gift of all. New family members who bring their own family traditions. We stay up late, we play cards with fun playlists full of music that's new to me. I sleep happily.\n\nI miss my boys being little. I always will. But these men and their partners and our holidays together? This feels like the real reward.",

    "description": "The Justice Department released new documents related to the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday.",
    "fullText": "The Justice Department's long-awaited release of the Epstein files on Friday offered a deeper look at the jet-setting lifestyle of the late sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein — but few major revelations.\n\nThe data dump included thousands of files, mostly images, many of which were heavily redacted. The Justice Department released the documents to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law last month.\n\nThe department, citing the task of ensuring no information included in the release could be used to identify victims, did not make public its entire database on Friday, as the law required. The department said it would turn over more files in the coming weeks.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. Nine years later, the financier was charged with the sex trafficking of minors. He died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody.\n\nBusiness Insider has been reviewing the latest files, which continued to roll out late Friday evening. Here are our biggest takeaways.\n\nThe files contained numerous images of celebrities and politicians, including former president Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson, and British billionaire Richard Branson.\n\nThe photos are not evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nNot all of the celebs were pictured with Epstein, and at least one photo — of Diana Ross with Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson — can be found on the professional photography service, Getty Images, suggesting it was not Epstein's personal photo.\n\nThe context of many of the photos is also unclear, lacking dates, locations, and other identifying information.\n\nClinton featured prominently in the latest round of files, including several previously unseen photos.\n\nAngel Ureña, a spokesperson for Clinton, said on X that the former president was unaware of Epstein's criminal activity.\n\n\"There are two types of people here,\" he wrote. \"The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.\"\n\nOther famous figures seen in photos in the documents include actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, The Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger, and Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York. Business Insider reached out to them for comment.\n\nSpacey had earlier called for the release of the Epstein files and said in a post on X in July that he has \"nothing to fear.\" In multiple interviews before the latest release, Tucker has denied any knowledge of criminal activity. Jagger has not responded publicly. Ferguson has said she cut ties with Epstein after his conviction.\n\nThe Justice Department's release drew criticism from some victims and Democrats for its heavy redactions and limited initial release.\n\nIn some cases, entire documents were obscured by black boxes, including one 119-page file. The DOJ has attributed its delay in producing all the documents by the December 19 deadline in part to its duty to safeguard the personal information of victims and other individuals.\n\nThe files shed some light on how long young women have been accusing Epstein of wrongdoing.\n\nAmong the thousands of documents was a 1996 FBI memo included in a complaint filed against Epstein by a woman whose name the Justice Department redacted. Business Insider confirmed the accuser was Maria Farmer, who has previously said publicly that she reported Epstein to the authorities.\n\nIn her original complaint, Farmer says Epstein stole pictures of her 16-year-old sister and is \"believed to have sold them to potential buyers.\" She says he once asked someone to take photos of young women at swimming pools.\n\n\"I feel redeemed. This is one of the best days of my life,\" Farmer said in a statement to Business Insider shared by her lawyer.\n\nThe Justice Department was required by law to release the documents by December 19, but US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday that the files would be released in batches over the coming weeks. Four sets of files were released on Friday evening. The Justice Department posted an additional three sets late Friday, which included photos of evidence files.\n\nThe Justice Department's delay in releasing all the files at once has led to criticism from lawmakers. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie said the move \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna told CNN that he and Massie were now drafting articles of impeachment against US Attorney General Pam Bondi following the release.\n\nTrump is known to have socialized with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, and photos of the pair together have been well publicized in recent years.\n\nHe didn't feature prominently in Friday's document release. There was a photo of a messy desk that contained a photo of Trump inside a drawer. Trump has previously said he ended his ties with Epstein years ago.\n\nBlanche told ABC News on Friday that there had been \"no effort to hold anything back because there is the name Donald J Trump.\"\n\nTrump had not commented publicly on the files as of Saturday afternoon.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Burrows, Hope 2, Rosser, penalty, Dyer Cons: O'Brien 5 Pens: O'Brien 2\n\nTries: Gilbert, Prendergast 2 Cons: Gilbert 3\n\nDragons climbed off the bottom of the United Rugby Championship (URC) with a remarkable 48-28 victory against Connacht that ended a 15-month league winless streak.\n\nThe Rodney Parade club backed up their European Challenge Cup success against Lyon to win successive games for the first time since October 2022.\n\nHooker Oli Burrows, scrum-half Che Hope and wing Jared Rosser went over before a penalty try earned a 28-7 half-time lead.\n\nShell-shocked Connacht, who opened the scoring through full-back Sam Gilbert, were taken out of the contest at an increasingly raucous Rodney Parade by a pair of Angus O'Brien penalties.\n\nThe wheels had come off for the Irish province against their slick hosts, with wing Rio Dyer finishing superbly and then setting up Hope for a second.\n\nFlanker Cian Prendergast went over for a double to ensure Connacht were chasing an undeserved consolation bonus at the death and they got it with the clock in the red through Sean Jansen.\n\nStuart Lancaster's side have taken at least a point from every game this season but the scoreline flattered them in Newport.\n\nMunster rise to second in URC win against Ospreys\n\nPeel celebrates family wedding with win in Cardiff\n\nClovers defeat Gwalia in Celtic Challenge opener\n\nDragons recorded their first URC win since beating Ospreys on the opening weekend of 2024-25 while it was their first five-point haul in the league since the Judgement Day success against Scarlets in April 2023.\n\nAt one stage they were threatening to beat their 48-0 victory against Borders in 2007 - their biggest league winning margin.\n\nFilo Tiatia's men now go in search of ending their most embarrassing streak – the 20-game losing run against fierce rivals Cardiff that stretches back to the Challenge Cup quarter-final win in April 2015.\n\nThey make the short trip to the Arms Park on 26 December (15:00 GMT) before hosting Scarlets on New Year's Day.\n\nDragons do so buoyed by one of their finest performances in recent times, arguably the best since Munster were stunned in the first game of the Dai Flanagan era in 2022, and with welcome selection headaches.\n\nThere were plenty of huge performances with number eight Harrison Keddie, resurgent wing Dyer, influential centre Aneurin Owen, blind-side flanker Ryan Woodman, scrum-half Hope and full-back O'Brien – all homegrown players – having strong arguments for man of the match.\n\nIt was Dyer that got the official honour.\n\nConnacht hit the front in the 10th minute when direct running on the line was followed by fly-half Josh Ioane putting Gilbert over with a pop pass, the full-back adding the routine extras himself.\n\nDragons, who did not risk talisman Aaron Wainwright ahead of their festive derbies because the Wales number eight had a niggle, responded impressively to lead 14-7 after 26 minutes.\n\nPressure in the 22 led to hooker Burrows smashing over from a quick tap and then the hosts profited from some good fortune for Hope to race over after gathering the loose ball from a botched line-out.\n\nFull-back Angus O'Brien converted both scores and then provided the final pass to Rosser to put the buoyant Dragons over for their third try in the 32nd minute.\n\nA 21-7 lead represented a good half for the hosts but it got even better after Connacht opted to keep playing inside their own territory with the clock in the red.\n\nCentre Fine Inisi intercepted a pass, Dragons won a penalty and kicked for the corner to get their driving lineout moving.\n\nConnacht number eight Paul Boyle slipped and the maul was prevented from going over the line by his body; accidental but still resulting in a penalty try and a yellow card.\n\nBonus point secure, Dragons maturely stretched their lead to 34-7 with a pair of O'Brien penalties soon after the restart.\n\nThey kept the foot down and a fifth try followed when Dyer raced around scrum-half Ben Murphy in the 22.\n\nDragons flanker Thomas Young was denied a sixth shortly after coming on by a forward pass but Dyer turned provider on the hour by sprinting down the left and then keeping his cool to put Hope over.\n\nConnacht went hunting a consolation try bonus with seven minutes to play and found it thanks to a brace by flanker Prendergast.\n\nPressure at the death was rewarded by replacement back-row forward Sean Jansen crashing over.\n\nConnacht will end 2025 with just one away success in the URC – a victory against Zebre in Parma in May.\n\nStuart Lancaster's side will feel they should have won on two previous visits to Wales this season, at Cardiff in round three and when they blew a commanding lead at Ospreys in the Challenge Cup.\n\nHowever, they were comprehensively outplayed by Dragons and are now under pressure for a home fixture against Ulster on 27 December (17:30 GMT) and a 3 January trip to Dublin to face Leinster (17:30 GMT).\n\nConnacht will hope this humiliation sparks a reaction.\n\nDragons: O'Brien; J Rosser, Inisi, Owen, Dyer; De Beer, Hope; Martinez, Burrows, Hunt, Douglas, Carter (capt), Woodman, Beddall, Keddie.\n\nReplacements: G Roberts, Morris, Dlamini, Lewis-Hughes, Young, R Williams, Westwood, Anderson.\n\nConnacht: Gilbert;

    "fullText": "Try: Morris Cons: Edwards Pens: Edwards\n\nTries: Daly, Barron, Crowley, Haley Cons: Crowley 3\n\nMunster heaped more misery on Ospreys as their United Rugby Championship (URC) bonus-point win in Bridgend lifted the Irish province to second in the table.\n\nTries from wing Shane Daly, hooker Lee Barron, full-back Mike Haley and fly-half Jack Crowley, who finished with 11 points, gave Munster a comfortable victory with only Stormers above them in the table.\n\nOspreys responded with a Morgan Morris try and five points from Dan Edwards' boot.\n\nThe hosts had managed Challenge Cup victories against Connacht and Montauban, but now lie 16th in the URC table with only one win in seven league games as a trio of three Welsh sides fill the bottom three places.\n\nThe loss completed a tumultuous week for Ospreys with Wales captains Dewi Lake and Jac Morgan announcing they will join Gloucester at the end of the 2025-26 campaign, something coach Mark Jones described as a \"hammer blow\".\n\nLake had returned to captain Ospreys with while fellow Wales Wales internationals Edwards, Reuben Morgan-Williams, Rhys Davies, James Ratti and Harri Deaves also started.\n\nMunster made six personnel changes and two positional switches to the side which secured a Champions Cup bonus-point win against Gloucester.\n\nJeremy Loughman, Fineen Wycherley, Alex Kendellen, Paddy Patterson, Tom Farrell and Calvin Nash came in for the visitors.\n\nOspreys enjoyed the upper hand in the early exchanges with Edwards slotting over a penalty.\n\nBut home full-back Max Nagy was shown a yellow card for a needless trip on Daly, with the wing making the extra man tell with the opening try in the left corner after a fine pass from number eight Gavin Coombes.\n\nBoth sides were struggling with the heavy surface, while Lake was guilty of not finding his line-out jumpers.\n\nMunster's replacement hooker Barron was driven over for the second score, before scrum-half Patterson created the chance for Crowley to flop over to give the visitors a 19-3 half-time lead.\n\nHaley secured the attacking bonus-point fourth try early in the second half before Ospreys rallied with Morris crossing with a clever finish as Munster captain Jack O'Donoghue was shown a yellow card.\n\nThere was a scoreless final quarter as the game petered out.\n\nWhile there had been a vibrancy about Scarlets' Friday night 21-17 Welsh derby win against Cardiff that was played in front of just under 12,000, this was a more low-key affair that attracted a crowd of 4,715.\n\nNot surprising given the shambolic situation the Ospreys squad and supporters have been put in.\n\nThe crushing uncertainty is affecting the organisation with nobody knowing what the future holds for the crisis-ridden and directionless Welsh rugby system.\n\nLake says the main reason for his move was because of the unknown future of the domestic game in Wales, with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) proposing to cut one of its four men's professional sides.\n\nWelsh rugby's governing body has said it proposes to grant three licences for men's professional clubs. There will be one in Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west, which could result in a survival fight between Swansea-based Ospreys and Scarlets in Llanelli.\n\nAfter temporarily going into administration in April, Cardiff were taken over by the WRU with the governing body expecting to sell the organisation to fresh investors in the new year.\n\nOspreys' owners, Y11 Sport & Media, have been linked with taking over Cardiff, which is another way the WRU could get its wish of losing a men's professional side.\n\nOspreys, or the club's owners, have not commented about the Cardiff rumours, fuelling concern among supporters surrounding the future of their side.\n\nOn the field, Ospreys will have to try to remain focussed as they travel to face Scarlets in the west Wales derby on 26 December, while Munster host Leinster a day later.\n\nOspreys: Nagy; Kasende, Boshoff, Watkin, Giles; Edwards, Morgan-Williams: S Thomas, Lake (capt), Henry, R Davies, Smith, Ratti, Deaves, M Morris.\n\nReplacements: Parry, C Jones, Botha, Sutton, Morse, Hardy, K Williams, Walsh.\n\nMunster: Haley; Nash, T Farrell, Nankivell, Daly; Crowley, Patterson; Loughman, Scannell, Ala'alatoa, Kleyn, Wycherley, O'Donoghue (capt), Kendellen, Coombes.\n\nReplacements: Barron, Milne, Bartley, Edogbo, Ahern, Coughlan, Hanrahan, Hodnett.\n\nAssistant referees: Craig Evans & Andrew Moule (WRU)",

We were not in the contest for 40 minutes and just could not get a foothold in it. All the guys were excited about playing another Big Game at this stadium, but we started poorly.\n\n\"The half-time talk was about rolling our sleeves up and having a go. And we showed some commitment.\n\n\"We did that in the second half, but you shouldn't have to wait to half-time to roll your sleeves up and fight.\n\n\"I thought we were in a pretty good spot going into the contest, but things just didn't go to plan at all.\"\n\n\"I was pleased with the whole team. We set about it in the right, positive manner and had the game under control by half-time.\n\n\"It's a nice way to start the Prem games again and puts us right near the top. We now need to build on it.\"\n\n(On Louis Rees-Zammit) \"Louis has fitted in really well after returning from his NFL spell in the States.\n\n\"He's an outstanding lad who can switch from wing to full-back, where he played tonight. He can do special things and that's what he did here with his try.\"\n\nHarlequins: David; Cleaves, Beard, Northmore, Murley; Smith, Porter; Baxter, Walker, Williams, Petti, Treadwell, Carr, Kenningham, Cunningham-South\n\nReplacements: Riley, Hobson, Delgado, Launchbury, Evans, Friday, Waghorn, Isgro\n\nBristol: Rees-Zammit; Boshoff, BJ van Rensburg, Williams, Ravouvou; Jordan, Marmion; Genge, Oghre, Chawatama, Rubiolo, Batley, Owen, S Grondona, Harding\n\nReplacements: Thacker, Woolmore, Kloska, Taylor, B Grondona, Randall, Worsley, Heward\n\nSin-bin: Jordan [57], Williams [71]",

    "description": "Liverpool stretch their unbeaten run to six games but Alexander Isak's injury while scoring overshadows win at Tottenham.",
    "fullText": "It was meant to be the moment that finally kick-started the season for Alexander Isak.\n\nLiverpool's £125m signing had come off the bench and finished wonderfully past Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario to give Arne Slot's side the lead.\n\nOn the touchline, Slot was ecstatic after seeing Isak combine with Florian Wirtz, who got his first Premier League assist after signing for £116m in the summer.\n\nWith Mohamed Salah in Morocco on Africa Cup of Nations duty and Cody Gakpo out with injury, here was a glimpse of Liverpool's future. And the first sign of a connection between Liverpool's two record signings.\n\nYet within seconds, that joy turned to concern as Isak lay on the floor in agony after Micky van de Ven's tackle. As his team-mates gathered around him, it became clear that Isak would be unable to continue.\n\n\"We'll have to wait and see,\" said Slot. \"But if a player scores and then gets injured and doesn't try to come back on the pitch, that's usually not a good thing.\"\n\nFor Liverpool, who have seemingly turned a corner and are now unbeaten in six, the problems continue to mount though with Isak and Conor Bradley both facing a spell on the sidelines.\n\nTo sum up their misfortune in a nutshell, Bradley was taken off at half-time after a knock for Isak. On the hour mark, Isak came off for Jeremie Frimpong, who was playing his first game since October.\n\nFrimpong then failed to finish the game as he was replaced by Federico Chiesa in the 90th minute, though Slot insisted that the full-back would be fine and that he simply didn't want to take the risk of playing for 30 seconds with 10 men. Either way, two players that Slot subbed on failed to finish the game.\n\nIn the end, Hugo Ekitike's goal ensured Liverpool held on to yet another crucial victory but they almost blew it against the nine men of Tottenham, who had both Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero sent off.\n\n\"A masterclass on how not to manage the final 10 minutes\" was the verdict of Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports. Slot himself admitted that it was far from ideal.\n\n\"It's unbelievable if you play against nine men that I would not be surprised if for the nine minutes of added time, they had the ball for eight and a half. That is not what you expect and maybe that tells you where we are in this season,\" Slot told BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"We need a few more wins to get a bit more comfortable with setbacks. The thing that keeps in your mind is the last 10 minutes, but there was a lot more to like in the first 80 to 90 minutes.\"",

    "description": "As we approach the halfway point of the season, what do the ghosts of Christmas past tell us about the Premier League title race and relegation battle?",
    "fullText": "Arsenal will spend Christmas Day on top of the Premier League tree this year, while Wolves, Burnley and West Ham are hanging precariously on the bottom branches.\n\nAs we approach the halfway point of the season, what do the ghosts of Christmas past tell us about the title race and relegation battle?\n\nThe team that is top of the Premier League on Christmas Day has gone on to win the title in 17 of the previous 33 seasons – basically a flip of a chocolate coin.\n\nHowever, Arsenal themselves have a much bleaker record as they've been top at Christmas four times before but have never gone on to lift the trophy.\n\nThe Gunners had only been top at this stage twice before Mikel Arteta took charge, but this is the third time in four seasons that they sit top of the tree at Christmas.\n\nTheir fans will hope that the wisdom Arteta's men have received in seasons past will see them finally hold off Manchester City and deliver the gift they've been wishing for since 2004.\n\n\"You'd like to think that through all the experiences that Arsenal have had being top at Christmas, they can understand the mistakes made in the back half of some seasons that stopped them from winning the title,\" former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha told Football Focus.\n\nThere isn't a lot of room for error though as Arsenal have a slender lead of just two points, while the average lead by the team top on Christmas Day is four points.\n\nIn fact, the only table-toppers at Christmas to have a smaller lead than Arsenal in the last 12 seasons were the Gunners themselves two years ago.\n\nBut while a two-point lead isn't much, history suggests it might be enough.\n\nArsenal are the eighth side in Premier League history to have a two-point lead at Christmas and five of the previous seven went on to win the title, including the last four.\n\nBizarrely Arsenal are the only side to win the Premier League without ever doing it when they were top at Christmas, as all three of their titles came when chasing the leaders at this time of year.\n\nThey were sixth and an incredible 13 points behind leaders Man Utd in 1997-98, second and three points behind Newcastle in 2001-02 and third and one point behind Man Utd at Christmas time in 2003-04.\n\nThat 13-point deficit in 1997-98 is the most points a team has ever been behind the leaders at Christmas and won the title (Arsenal did have a game in hand), while the lowest the eventual champions have been in the table at this stage is eighth, by Manchester City in the Covid-delayed season of 2020-21.\n\nWeirdly the team in second on Christmas Day has gone on to win the title in only two of the past 17 seasons, although both times it was Manchester City who did so.\n\nIn fact, in the last five seasons where the leaders at Christmas did not go on to win the title, the Premier League was won each time by Manchester City.\n\nFor many Arsenal fans, there will be a sense of deja vu. Leading the Premier League at Christmas before being eaten up by a relentless Pep Guardiola side is something the Gunners have got a little bit used to.\n\nSeeing a seven-point lead over Manchester City cut to two in the space of five games won't exactly fill them with confidence either.\n\n\"We're back on top of the table but we're not watching City too much, or the other teams,\" said Bukayo Saka. \"We're in control now. We know if we win every week we'll stay there.\"\n\nArteta added: \"The only thing we can control is our own performance and results and we know how long it's going to be and how tough is this league. That's it.\"\n\nManchester City have obviously got history on their side. Guardiola has won the Premier League title six times, the Bundesliga three times with Bayern Munich and La Liga three times with Barcelona. Arteta has no league titles as a manager.\n\nGuardiola's squad are full of Premier League winners, players who know what it takes to end a campaign strong, while none of the Arsenal squad have won a Premier League – but have experienced losing leads over the past few seasons.\n\nWhy can't this season be different though? Manchester City look far from the relentless side they have in previous seasons – and have already lost four games this campaign, compared to Arsenal's two losses.\n\n\"We will be there. If they follow me we will be there but we have to improve,\" said Guardiola.\n\n\"I know the level in Europe, in the Premier League, I know Arsenal and the other teams and how tough they are. It is not enough.\n\n\"The spirit is there, last season we did not have the spirit or aggression or hunger - all the attributes they need. It is not about the highlights and how good the actions are, there is something that comes from inside where we will recover from the Club World Cup.\"\n\nCity's attack is flowing, having scored 10 more goals than Arsenal, but having also conceded six more – you feel the title race could be defined by whether City's goals can outshine Arsenal's solidity.\n\nOnly four times in 33 Premier League seasons has the side bottom on Christmas Day survived, with the most recent being Wolves in 2022-23.\n\nBut with just two points won and a record 16 points from safety, it would take not just a Christmas miracle but a New Year's, Valentine's and Easter one too for bottom side Wolves to survive once again.\n\nSecond-bottom Burnley have a fighting chance as almost half the teams in their position at Christmas have stayed up, although the only time that's happened in the past eight seasons was when Eddie Howe led Newcastle to 11th in 2021-22.\n\nWest Ham fans have the most reason to be optimistic as the team in 18th has survived in two out of three seasons on average, most recently Nottingham Forest in 2022-23 and Wolves last time out.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that one of West Ham, Burnley and Wolves will stay up as that's happened just over half the time, with two teams surviving in 12 of the previous 33 seasons.\n\nThe three teams bottom at Christmas have never all survived while only four times in Premier League history have all three been relegated, although two of those occurred recently in 2020-21 and 2023-24.\n\nIn terms of who could be relegated in their place, the team flying highest at Christmas that ultimately went down were Norwich in 1994-95, who were seventh with 30 points and 11 points above the drop.\n\nThat was in a 42-game season though. In a 38-game campaign, the best team on Christmas Day to be relegated were Blackpool in 2010-11, who were 10th with 22 points but finished 19th with 39 points.\n\nNewcastle in 2008-09 were 12th with 22 points and went down, while the most points a relegated side has been above the bottom three at Christmas is seven by Reading in 2007-08, who were 12th with 21 points.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",
