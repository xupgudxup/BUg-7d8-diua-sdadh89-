    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Augustana) — The Augustana men’s basketball team closed the 2025 calendar year with a 82-69 wire-to-wire victory over Concordia-St. Paul on Saturday afternoon at the Elmen Center.\n\nThe Vikings (8-4, 6-1 NSIC) shot 49.1 percent from the field and knocked down 10 3-pointers while limiting the Golden Bears (8-5, 3-4) to 37.5 percent shooting and 8 of 31 shooting from deep.\n\nTameron Ferguson led the Vikings with 22 points, five assists and two steals. Tanner Te Slaa added 15 points and 10 rebounds, his first double double of the season, and Caden Hinker scored 12 points. Amari Westmoreland-Vendiola was a spark off the bench, scoring seven points and grabbing seven boards while Bennett Fried and Markus Talley each had seven points apiece.\n\nHinker and Te Slaa opened the game with 3-pointers and Ferguson got a layup off a Sam Rensch steal to get the Vikings off to an 8-0 start. After a CSP layup, Hinker had five points in a 9-2 Viking run to give AU a 17-4 lead at the 16:18 mark of the first half.\n\nAfter CSP chipped back within nine points, Westmoreland-Vendiola knocked down a jumper to restart the offense. Hinker followed with a layup and Fried knocked down a 3-pointer to make it 29-13 with 9:36 to go in the half.\n\nThe final nine minutes of the quarter saw 19 CSP points and 18 AU points to get the Golden Bears within 47-32 at half. The Vikings shot 16 of 30 from the field and 7 of 16 from deep in the first half while holding CSP to 10 of 31 shooting from the field and 3 of 16 from deep. Hinker led with 12 points and Ferguson had 11 while Te Slaa added eight.\n\nCSP opened the second half scoring with a layup before four Te Slaa points and a Ferguson layup grew the Viking lead to 53-34 with 16:40 to play. That lead fell to 15 before a Te Slaa 3-pointer at the 13:07 mark to make it 65-47 AU.\n\nTalley knocked down a 3-pointer after a CSP bucket and Ferguson got a layup to go, stretching the lead to 70-49. In the final 10:25 of play, the Vikings extended possessions and spent time winding the clock, getting outscored 20-12 but limiting possessions to help bring the game to its final score.\n\nThe Vikings will return to the court in 2026, welcoming Wayne State to the Elmen Center on Jan. 3 at 1:30 p.m.",

    "fullText": "Packers' mistakes vs. Bears: How Green Bay's miscues led to damaging loss to division rival originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bears' failure to get a field goal attempt off before the two-minute warning was supposed to be the death knell for Ben Johnson's team on Saturday night. Instead, it directly preceded a massive momentum shift that turned the game Chicago's way.\n\nA successful onside kick, which couldn't be handled by the Green Bay Packers, suddenly breathed life into the Bears and set the stage for a miraculous 22-16 overtime win that could very well have decided the NFC North.\n\nThe Packers' inability to bring in the onside kick was the most glaring mistake of the night for Matt LaFleur's squad, but it wasn't the only miscue that changed the complexion of the game.\n\nHere's a look at how the Packers' mistakes may have decided the NFC North.\n\nNFL Week 16 picks against the spread\n\nAfter the game, LaFleur said there were \"too many errors in critical moments that got us beat,\" naming three in particular and giving credit to the Bears for taking advantage.\n\nIt won't receive as much attention as the Packers' later mistakes, but Josh Jacobs' fumble at the two-yard line in the third quarter proved to be costly for Green Bay. The Packers wasted a scoring opportunity with a chance to stretch a three-point lead to 10, giving the Bears some life after nearly quieting the crowd.\n\nNahshon Wright's breakout season continues!\n\nHe forces a fumble inside the 5 🐻\n\nGBvsCHI on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/KyXTLxP3vF\n\nTo be fair, the Packers did force a punt on the ensuing drive and score a touchdown before the end of the quarter to push their lead to 13-3. Had Green Bay added another score on the drive that ended in a fumble, even if only a field goal, the entire game could have ended differently. Then again, there is no way to blame the loss solely on Jacobs' fumble when the Packers still couldn't protect a 13-3 lead later on.\n\nMORE: NFC North standings and playoff picture\n\nIn a moment that undoubtedly brought back a painful memory for Packers fans, Green Bay gave the Bears new life when Romeo Doubs failed to bring in an onside kick with less than two minutes remaining in regulation.\n\nBears recover the onside kick 👀👀\n\nGBvsCHI on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/gabjYXsJXB\n\nBecause Chicago failed to get a field goal attempt off before the two-minute warning, recovering an onside kick was effectively the Bears' only chance to put the ball back in Caleb Williams' hands while trailing by a touchdown. Onside kicks are even harder to recover now than they were 11 years ago, when Brandon Bostick whiffed on the Seattle Seahawks' attempt—making Saturday's moment even more painful for the Packers.\n\nThe Bears then drove down the field and tied the game on a touchdown pass to Jahdae Walker, despite not having scored a touchdown in the first 59 minutes.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the game, LaFleur said he has to watch the play again to determine whether there was a blocking issue, but he admitted Doubs \"had the opportunity to field the ball\" and should have been able to bring it in.\n\nWhen the Packers were one yard away from a fresh set of downs to move into more comfortable field goal range in overtime, another mistake derailed their plans. The snap to Malik Willis ended up on the ground almost instantly, and the Bears quickly swarmed toward the ball to prevent Green Bay from advancing it for a first down.\n\nSNAP IS FUMBLED. BEARS TAKE OVER\n\nGBvsCHI on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/vdn3aKwDOo\n\nHad the Packers picked up a first down, they could have attempted a field goal without moving the chains again. Instead, Matt LaFleur's best fourth down play never saw the light of day, and the Bears took over on downs and took advantage of the solid field position to set up a quick game-winning touchdown drive.\n\nMORE:How long is Jordan Love out with concussion?\n\nHere's a look at the updated NFC North standings after Chicago's win:\n\nThe Bears haven't yet clinched a playoff berth, as they need a Detroit Lions loss to do so in Week 16, but their path to a division title is simple: win and in.\n\nOne more win would give Chicago its first NFC North title since 2018 and cap an improbable first season under coach Ben Johnson, potentially setting the stage for a top-two seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Packers, meanwhile, are one loss or Bears win away from being eliminated from NFC North contention, though they remain in a playoff spot as the NFC's No. 7 seed.\n\nMORE: Meet Jordan Love’s volleyball-player wife and the rest of his family",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (USF) – The University of Sioux Falls Men’s Basketball team closed the calendar year with offensive performance, knocking off Minnesota State 98–90 on Saturday afternoon inside the Stewart Center. Behind balanced scoring, dominance on the glass, and an aggressive approach against the Mavericks’ size, the Cougars earned a statement NSIC victory heading into the holiday break.\n\nSioux Falls leaned into its physicality and depth to secure the win, finishing with four players scoring 16 or more points and posting a decisive rebounding edge. USF shot 42.5 percent from the field while generating 52 points in the paint and 23 second-chance points. Bryon Laue delivered a breakout performance with 18 points and a game-high 16 rebounds, while Brandon Hrncir and Brogan Madson each added 18 points as the Cougars consistently attacked mismatches.\n\nThe Cougars took control at the free-throw line and in transition during the second half, converting 24-of-28 free throws after the break and scoring 22 fast-break points for the game. Jacoby Mehrman added 16 points on efficient shooting, and Camden Davis chipped in 10 points off the bench as USF outscored Minnesota State 54–49 in the second half to close out the 98–90 victory.\n\nThe opening 20 minutes featured a steady back-and-forth, with Sioux Falls building offense through paint touches and extra possessions. USF shot 43.6 percent from the field in the half and generated early success on the offensive glass, finishing the game with 23 offensive rebounds. Laue set the tone early on the boards, while Hrncir and Madson combined to keep the Cougars in rhythm offensively.\n\nMinnesota State shot efficiently in the first half at 47.2 percent, but Sioux Falls countered by limiting perimeter damage and forcing the Mavericks to earn points inside. The Cougars went 8-of-11 at the free-throw line in the half and carried a 44–41 advantage into the locker room.\n\nSioux Falls seized control after halftime by attacking relentlessly and capitalizing at the stripe. The Cougars scored 54 second-half points and went 24-of-28 at the free-throw line, repeatedly punishing Minnesota State for fouling. Mehrman and Hrncir were effective in finishing through contact, while Madson orchestrated the offense and drew fouls attacking downhill.\n\nAlthough Minnesota State shot 51.5 percent in the half and scored 49 points, USF offset that efficiency with rebounding, transition scoring, and second-chance opportunities. The Cougars won the rebounding battle 49–33 and turned those extra possessions into timely buckets and free throws, allowing them to maintain separation and close out the win.\n\n“I thought we played very well on the offensive end against their size. We had some guys really step up, notably Laue, Mehrman, and Hrncir. A fun way to go into the break.”\n— Head Coach Chris Johnson\n\nBryon Laue – 18 points, 16 rebounds, 7-of-14 FG\n\nBrandon Hrncir – 18 points, 9 rebounds, 7-of-8 FT\n\nBrogan Madson – 18 points, 6 assists, 9-of-12 FT\n\nJacoby Mehrman – 16 points, 5 rebounds, 6-of-11 FG\n\nKyle Ingwerson – 10 points, 2 steals\n\nRebounding: Sioux Falls dominated the glass 49–33, including 23 offensive rebounds that led to 23 second-chance points.\n\nFree Throws: The Cougars went 32-of-39 at the line, including 24-of-28 in the second half.\n\nPaint: USF scored 52 points in the paint by consistently attacking Minnesota State’s interior.\n\nTransition: Sioux Falls tallied 22 fast-break points, capitalizing on defensive stops and rebounds.\n\nBalance: Five Cougars scored in double figures as USF spread scoring across the lineup.\n\nThe Cougars return to action on January 3, traveling to Marshall, Minnesota, to take on Southwest Minnesota State at 2:00 p.m.",

Boston outplayed the Canucks and had more than twice as many shots on goal, but made several costly mistakes and mental lapses that came back to haunt them.\n\nThe Bruins had multiple chances to win the game in shootouts but failed to score in all seven of their opportunities, missing out on a point in the process.\n\nAfter the game, head coach Marco Sturm was clearly disappointed in the final outcome and didn’t hold back in his analysis.\n\nBrick asked Marco Sturm if he thinks the Bruins deserved to win this game. Marco's answer 😬\n\n\"I'm not sure … that's probably one of the worst games of the year.\" pic.twitter.com/04R2u3JmvW\n\n— NESN (@NESN) December 21, 2025\n\n“Those little individual mistakes, I would say, cost us,” Sturm said during his postgame interview. “Some guys, it was probably one of their worst games of the year. Unfortunately, it just cost us a point.”\n\nSturm acknowledged that Boston played well early on but wasn’t able to maintain it for the full 60 minutes, failing to put Vancouver away and allowing them to come back with sloppy miscues.\n\n“Those kinds of teams, you have to put away early on, and we just didn’t,” Sturm added. “And all of a sudden, little things make a big difference. Special teams again. But yeah, it was just unfortunate.”\n\nAfter losing three of their last four games, the Bruins will look to bounce back against the Ottawa Senators at home on Sunday.\n\nMarco Sturm Details Bruins’ Lineup Changes Against Canucks",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter losing Micah Parsons, the Green Bay Packers will likely have to start leaning a bit more heavily on their offense. That would be difficult without QB Jordan Love.\n\nLove exited Saturday's game against the Chicago Bears with a concussion after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit from Austin Booker. While Love was able to leave the field under his own power, he did not return and was later formally diagnosed with a concussion.\n\nThe Packers have full confidence in backup quarterback Malik Willis, who won two starts in place of Love last season, but they will want to be at full strength for a pivotal Week 17 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Love’s outlook for Green Bay’s next game.\n\nNFL Week 16 picks against the spread\n\nThe Packers' next game is also a Saturday contest, which means Love would need to clear concussion protocol in seven days after his injury.\n\nThe length of time needed to recover from a concussion is dependent on each individual player, but the average length of time in the concussion protocol is about nine days, CBS Sports reported in 2023.\n\nThat doesn't mean Love can't make it back in time to face the Ravens. Plenty of players do suffer a concussion and suit up the following week, but it's virtually impossible to predict how a player's body will respond and how long it will take for symptoms to dissipate.\n\nLove will need to return to practice in the week ahead before he can play as part of the protocol, so his practice status later in the week could give fans an early sign about his availability. If Love can't play, Willis would get the start at home against Baltimore.\n\nAfter the loss, coach Matt LaFleur said he did not have any update on the concussed Love.\n\nMORE:How Packers-Bears game impacts NFC North race\n\nHere are the steps players have to take to leave the concussion protocol:\n\nIn this initial phase, players are instructed to avoid most activity. They are expected to rest and limit anything that could aggravate their symptoms. Eventually, players may progress to limited stretching and light aerobic exercise, provided they are supervised by team training staff.\n\nPlayers will start to work on cardio exercises along with stretching and training, with team medical staff supervising. After this phase, players can start working on balance testing.\n\nIn the third stage, players can take part in football-specific exercises and start working with the team for up to 30 minutes under supervision. Players are also able to increase their cardio workloads.\n\nPlayers reaching the fourth stage are able to start throwing, catching and running and engage in activities more specific to their position. They also can continue to ramp up their exercise and training. By end of this phase, players have to have undergone neurocognitive and balance testing.\n\nThe player has to be cleared by both the club physician and the independent neurological consultant to return to full activity.\n\nMORE:Complete guide to NFL concussion protocol\n\nThe Packers will close out their season with matchups against the Ravens and Minnesota Vikings.\n\nGreen Bay's final home game will come against a Ravens team desperate to stay in AFC North contention, while a resurgent Vikings squad will try to play spoiler in some form against the Packers in Week 18.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSaturday's game between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears began as a typical cold-weather, defensive NFC North battle, but the hard hitting caught up with the Packers in the second quarter.\n\nQuarterback Jordan Love exited the game after absorbing a helmet-to-helmet hit from Bears defensive tackle Austin Booker. While Love was able to jog off the field under his own power, he remained down for several minutes after Booker delivered the blow.\n\nBooker was penalized for the hit due to its helmet-to-helmet nature.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Love’s injury and his status going forward.\n\nMORE:Inside NFC North race between Packers, Bears, Lions\n\nLove exited Saturday's game after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit from Booker and was diagnosed with a concussion.

Likely to be evaluated for a concussion: pic.twitter.com/2hL4w7xawu\n\n— Arye Pulli (@AryePulliNFL) December 21, 2025\n\nWhile the Packers star walked off the field under his own power, he was visibly shaken up and stayed down on the field for a handful of minutes. After leaving the field to be evaluated, he was replaced by backup Malik Willis.\n\nAfter the game, Matt LaFleur said he didn't have any new updates on the concussed Love.\n\nLove hasn't missed a start since the opening month of the 2024 season, though Willis filled in admirably during that absence, winning his two starts as an injury replacement.\n\nNFL Week 16 picks against the spread\n\nLove suffered an apparent head injury on a helmet-to-helmet hit from Bears DT Austin Booker in the first half of Saturday's game against the Bears.\n\nThe hit knocked Love backward and left him visibly shaken up, but he was able to walk off the field himself after being tended to by trainers for a handful of minutes.\n\nLove was diagnosed with a concussion on Saturday and ruled out for the remainder of the game. The Packers' next game is also a Saturday night contest, so Love will have exactly a week to be cleared to start against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nLove is backed up by Malik Willis, who is in his second season with the Packers.\n\nA former third-round pick of the Tennessee Titans, Willis struggled to earn an opportunity to see the field in Nashville and was traded to Green Bay in the days leading up to the 2024 season.\n\nDespite the short turnaround, Willis won his first two starts in a Packers uniform in place of an injured Love in Weeks 3 and 4 last season.\n\nLove is the clear-cut franchise quarterback in Green Bay, even if he still has room for growth, and the Packers are totally comfortable with Willis as their backup after his brief but impressive stint in place of Love early in 2024.\n\nThe Packers' emergency No. 3 quarterback is Clayton Tune, but he is not on the active roster, meaning RB Josh Jacobs is Green Bay's likely emergency quarterback, according to Matt LaFleur.\n\nA fifth-round pick out of Houston in 2023, Tune spent his first two seasons with the Arizona Cardinals and made one start before being cut loose at the end of training camp this year. Tune has been on Green Bay's practice squad since joining the organization in late August.",

    "fullText": "The trip to Edmonton will be one of soul searching for the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nOn Saturday, the Golden Knights saw their point streak snapped at eight games in emphatic fashion in a 6-3 loss to the Calgary Flames.\n\nThe game was messy early, which the Flames took advantage of on a broken play. After a shot went off the post and through the five hole of Akira Schmid, the puck found its way to Mikael Backlund’s stick. The Flames captain made no mistake to get the home team on the board first.\n\nThe second Flames goal came with some controversy attacked. Calgary defenseman Yan Kuznetsov was able to fire a slapshot past Schmid, but Adam Klapka ran him while the play was ongoing. However, due to the goal being scored prior to the contact, the goal stood with no goalie interference.\n\nJust as the game was getting away, however, the Golden Knights were able to strike back. Mark Stone was able to find Reilly Smith on a breakaway, who was able to beat Devin Cooley with a deke to his backhand for his fourth goal of the season.\n\nUnfortunately, the Golden Knights gave the momentum back on a poor defensive play. Allowing two players to get behind everyone, Vegas could only watch as Ryan Lomberg finished an odd-man rush to get a two-goal lead back to Calgary.\n\nThe second period did not get much better. Mikael Backlund put his second of the game early, and a shorthanded goal from Joel Farabee put the Golden Knights on the wrong end of a blowout.\n\nKaedan Korczak did his part to make the game look better, though. Mitch Marner was able to find the defenseman, who beat Cooley with a shot through traffic for his fourth of the season.\n\nThe third period would see the Golden Knights make a push, headlined by a Mark Stone power-play marker to cut deeper into the lead, but Jonathan Huberdeau’s empty net goal sealed the defeat for Vegas.",

It would have been a disastrous loss for Golden State, as it would have been their fourth consecutive defeat. Thankfully for the Warriors, Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler combined for 53 points.\n\nDraymond Green only got to play eight minutes, as he was ejected from the game with two technical fouls. It was a surprising call because most people did not expect that to happen, but the Warriors had to play almost the whole game without their best defender.\n\nWarriors head coach Steve Kerr admits that at least one technical foul was warranted because Green was talking to the referees. However, Kerr disliked that the second technical was quickly called on Green, which led to the ejection.\n\nKerr was livid about the call, which led to him also getting a technical foul. It was a bad stretch for the Warriors because they lost a top defender and playmaker. However, it appeared that the Warriors were fueled by Green's ejection.\n\nMore: Ranking 3 Key Golden State Warriors Trade Targets\n\n\"I thought it was weak.

Pre-meditated, punches him in the stomach, no ejection for that,\" Kerr said after the game.\n\nDillon Brooks was the player that Kerr was talking about, which was why he was livid. Kerr wanted to call it out because it was not the best moment for the referees, given the context a couple of days prior.\n\nThe Warriors needed a win after their struggles in the past few weeks. They lost to the same Suns team on Thursday, so they wanted to get revenge for that. However, it was a tough matchup for the Warriors, especially when Green got ejected.\n\nThankfully for the Warriors, Curry and Butler stepped up in his place.

It spilled into the second, I think it woke us up because we knew without him, we had to play tougher,\" Curry said after the game about the ejection.\n\nNow, the Warriors are 14-15 on the season, clinging to the eighth seed in the Western Conference. It will be a tough stretch moving forward, but the Warriors are ready to improve in their quest to make the postseason.",

    "fullText": "The wisdom was that for the San Diego State Aztecs to knock off the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats in the Hall of Fame Series, everything would have to go right.\n\nThey got a gritty defensive effort that held the top-ranked team to equaling its fewest first half points of the season, but the offense disappeared into the desert night in a 68-45 loss at the Mortgage Matchup Center in Phoenix on Saturday night.\n\nSDSU (6-4) shot a season-low 26.3% from the field, with Reese Dixon-Waters scoring 8 points and the Aztecs not getting a second player with multiple field goal makes until Tae Simmons battled a bucket home nearly four minutes into the second half.\n\nMeanwhile Arizona (11-0) got 11 points each from Jaden Bradley and Koa Peat, while Tobe Awaka had 15 rebounds and Motiejus Krivas had 13 rebounds and three blocks. In addition to having five players in double-figure scoring, the Wildcats had a 20-10 edge in offensive rebounding () overall and had a 32-24 edge in paint scoring.\n\nThe Aztecs watched a 7-point lead disappear thanks to an 8-0 Arizona run to close the first half, and their shooting woes continued after halftime. Just three makes over the first 10 minutes of the second, as the Scarlet and Black settled for mid-range and perimeter jump shots instead of attacking the rim. They had 13 attempts at the line in the opening half, but it took until the 8:03 mark to draw the second Wildcats foul out of the break.\n\nArizona generated a 15-8 edge in free throw attempts in the second half, and had a 27-19 edge in freebie tries for the game.\n\nThe Wildcats relentlessly attacked the paint, which also created additional space for their shooters to start making from downtown. Back-to-back 3’s from Anthony Dell’Orso and Dwayne Aristode gave the Wildcats their first double-digit lead (47-34) at the 11 minute mark and forced a timeout.\n\nArizona’s length and height gave the Aztecs fits all night on offense, with SDSU making just eight field goals in the first half and seven in the second half. BJ Davis saw his seven-game streak of scoring in double-figures end after going 1 of 12 shooting, as he, Dixon-Waters and Miles Byrd combined to go 5 of 29 from the field.\n\nFor much of the first half the game was played at the Aztecs tempo, with the Wildcats only able to manage 3 points on the fast break. The defense also held an Arizona offense that averaged nearly 31 shot attempts per half to 25, as early foul trouble for Peat meant the Wildcats top scorer played only seven minutes.\n\nAfter Bradley’s pair of free throws just after the first media timeout, SDSU got back-to-back scores when Pharaoh Compton converted a pair at the line and then Jeremiah Oden splashed a 3-pointer to give the Scarlet and Black the lead that they held for over 15 minutes.\n\nDixon-Waters made his first of two jumpers in the opening 20, the only Scarlet and Black player to do so, which kicked off a mini 6-0 run that pushed the lead out to 8 points near the midway mark. Davis made a pair of free throws and a Magoon Gwath paint bucket, but the make by the big at the 10:07 was SDSU’s third-to-last of the half.\n\nThe Aztecs made just two of their final 14 shots from the field, with Dixon-Waters hitting a shot and then Tae Simmons battling for a bucket on the block. But the 7 point lead evaporated over the final 1:49 of the half as the Wildcats closed it on an 8-0 run.\n\nA key moment came with Bradley on the line again, when head coach Brian Dutcher was called for a technical foul. While Dell’Orso made just one of the two free throws, it brought life to the crowd, which roared as the senior guard hit Arizona’s first 3-pointer of the half with 32 seconds left for a 28-27 halftime lead.\n\nSDSU returns to The Mesa for their final pre-holidays game on Tuesday, Dec. 22, when they face the DIII Whittier College Poets at 1 p.m. at Viejas Arena.",

    "fullText": "Australia have beaten England by 82 runs in the third Test to go 3-0 up and secure the Ashes at the earliest opportunity.\n\nBen Duckett – 2 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best openers in the world, only to suffer a collapse in form and presence. Failures of others were predictable, Duckett's was not and is a huge concern.\n\nZak Crawley – 6 – Showed admirable fight and adaptability in England's second innings, but probably needs a hundred to be immune from a post-series clearout.\n\nOllie Pope – 2 – Test career over for now? Averages 17.6 in Ashes Tests. Since 1900, only England's Dennis Amiss has had as many as Pope's 16 innings in the top six in Ashes Tests and averaged less.\n\nJoe Root – 4 – Two starts, without making a telling contribution. Twice dismissed by Cummins, for whom Root is a bunny. The Yorkshireman must be pleased the Australia captain missed the first two Tests of the series.\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Largely stayed true to his promise to \"rein it in\", but the second-innings dismissal reverse-sweeping Lyon was ugly. Would be a huge waste if Australia does not see his best on this tour.\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Battled bravely in England's first innings, even if his resistance never seemed likely to turn into a trademark miracle. Did not bowl when England needed him on day three.\n\nJamie Smith – 6 – Finally got into the series with a counter-attacking 60 in the second innings, now has to kick on in Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nWill Jacks – 6 – A part-time spinner unfairly asked to do the job of a veteran. Resisted admirably with the bat, making himself harder to leave out.\n\nBrydon Carse – 5 – Continuing a bizarre tour of picking up wickets despite not bowling well. England have a decision to make over the Durham man in Melbourne.\n\nJofra Archer – 8 – Emerging as England's player of the tour. A maiden Test half-century and first five-wicket haul in six years. Demonstrating it was more than worth the wait for him to return to full fitness.\n\nJosh Tongue – 6 – Encouraging return after being overlooked for the first two Tests. Was the unfortunate bowler for the Khawaja drop and Carey Snicko shocker. Should get another go in Melbourne.\n\nJake Weatherald - 2 - Quiet game after a promising start to his Test career. Would be a potential Australian weakness for England to exploit had the Ashes not already been lost.\n\nTravis Head – 8 – Any flicker of hope England might have had was snuffed out by a century from South Australia's favourite son in the second innings. Head's promotion to open the batting is a defining moment in the outcome of the series.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne – 5 – No real contribution with the bat, but gets an extra mark apiece for two sensational catches at second slip. Still a nagging doubt he has a big score in him before the end of the series.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 7 – Took his chance after Steve Smith's illness, albeit via a life from Harry Brook. Should keep his place for Sydney.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Could not produce a performance to match his huge Indian Premier League pricetag and batting two places too high. Took the important wicket of Brook in the first innings.\n\nAlex Carey – 8 – Challenging Mitchell Starc as player of the series. Loses a point because he should have been given out in the first innings.\n\nJosh Inglis – 4 – An important 32 when England sensed momentum on the first day, but hasn't fully taken his chance. Could be squeezed out when Smith returns.\n\nPat Cummins – 7 – How has this man not bowled since July? Immediately into the groove with relentless accuracy. Once again an Ashes-winning captain.\n\nMitchell Starc – 6 – Not touching the heights of the first two Tests, though bowled with high pace in the first innings and took the key wickets of Jamie Smith and Will Jacks on the final day.\n\nNathan Lyon – 6 – Broke England's resistance with a triple-wicket burst on the fourth evening, only to hobble off with a hamstring injury on the final day. Could be out for the series.\n\nScott Boland – 6 – Unsung hero of Australia's attack, keeping up the pressure when the superstars rest. Will be in the conversation to rest in Melbourne, the venue where he destroyed England four years ago.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United could be without as many as six key first-team stars when they take on Aston Villa away from home on Sunday.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain sidelined, while Casemiro is set to serve a one-match suspension after picking up his fifth individual caution against Bournemouth.\n\nThe biggest miss will be in attack, with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo both departing for AFCON, along with Noussair Mazraoui.\n\nThe Ivorian and Cameroonian have dovetailed to devastating effect, registering 11 goal involvements between them.\n\nThankfully, Ruben Amorim will be able to welcome back Benjamin Sesko from the start after his cameo against the Cherries last week.\n\nThe Slovenian was absent for a month owing to a knee injury, and his return is perfectly timed as far as Amorim is concerned.\n\nThe United No.30 has two goals and one assist, and he revealed to MUTV his delight at returning to action.\n\n“I was really happy when I came back, that I could be back with the team. I can enjoy, have a great time and try and get better every day.\n\n“It’s obviously a dream to do every single training out there and score some goals.”\n\nIn recent weeks, United have shown glimpses of their enormous potential in attack, scoring four goals in back-to-back games.\n\nDespite this, it was evident from the performance that the team could have scored a lot more if they had taken all their chances.\n\nHowever, the biggest conundrum for the head coach to solve is at the back, with the 20-time English league champions boasting of the worst defensive record among the top-12 sides in the division.\n\n“We know this is a great team, we are preparing with full power that we can use. Try to use it in certain situations, on the weak spots [of Aston Villa].\n\n“I think the guys are ready, we are looking forward to Sunday, trying to give our best and win the game.\n\n“[The message from Ruben has been] obviously to try and finish attacks because we had plenty of shots [against Bournemouth], try to be more clinical and in the defence just to have more focus.\n\n“As he says always, when we have a focus, it’s hard to beat us. We showed [that] many times, that’s the main focus for this weekend, to try and protect the net as long as possible.”\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Amorim sets his team up defensively, and the personnel he picks to offset the departure of his AFCON-bound stars.\n\nFeature image Gareth Copley via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Manchester City picked up a comfortable 3-nil win over West Ham at the Etihad Stadium yesterday to maintain the pressure on Premier League leaders Arsenal. A brace from Erling Haaland and a first-half goal from Tijjani Reijnders were enough to see City pick up a valuable three points. Pep Guardiola’s side barely had to get out of second gear yesterday against a struggling West Ham side. They made it seven consecutive wins in all competitions with their victory yesterday. But while City are racking up the wins, Pep Guardiola threw down a challenge to his players after their win yesterday. He believes that his team needs to go up a level to contend for silverware this season.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 3-nil win over West Ham, Pep Guardiola said he wants to see more from his team. He specifically spoke on their play in possession as an area that needs to improve. The Manchester City manager explained: “We are happy to win but the way we are with the ball, we have to improve otherwise it will not be enough to be title contenders in March, April and May.”\n\n“Always I have to thank Erling for the goals but today thanks to him, Phil and Nico O’Reilly, they help us a lot to do this game.”\n\n“Defensively we are improving and we can visualise it but with the ball, we are away from what we have to do. We are not close. The way we attack depends on how the opponents defend, we have to be in the right spots to make it more fluid and we were not.”\n\n“We are happy, we cannot deny we are in the Champions League spots, the semi-final of the Carabao Cup and up there in the Premier League.”\n\nA more telling quote from Pep Guardiola came when he urged his team to follow him and continue to improve. He added: “We will be there. If they follow me, we will be there, but we have to improve.”\n\n“I know the level but it’s not enough. The spirit, the aggression, the hunger is there. All the attributes they need that is not highlights. Many things, we have to do better.”\n\nEven though Manchester City have won seven consecutive matches in all competitions, Pep Guardiola’s assessment is on the money. There are obvious areas where this City team can improve. They were on display early in the second half of yesterday’s match. Manchester City struggled to play out from the back at the beginning of the second half. One misplaced pass from Bernardo Silva almost gifted West Ham a way back into the game. That is one clear area of City’s play that needs to improve. Manchester City have struggled at times this season to play out from the back, and that is a major area in which City can improve.\n\nThere are of course others. Pep Guardiola’s side is yet to establish the control of matches that they typically have and have built their play around. They were better in this regard yesterday but this portion of their play remains a work in progress. The major positive is that City are well placed to launch into the second half of this season despite having so many areas of their play which can improve. That is a major positive to take from Manchester City’s strong recent run of results.\n\nPep Guardiola has laid down the gauntlet to his team. He wants to see them to continue to improve so they can contend for silverware this season. Manchester City are entering a phase of the season where they have typically launched into title winning campaigns. But this is a new-look City team that needs to improve to match what their predecessors were able to do so often in the past. If this City team can follow suit anything is possible for Pep Guardiola’s side this season.",

    "description": "Running a private registry is easy; making it searchable isn't. Here's how reg taps SQLite to expose fast queries without touching S3.",
    "fullText": "Docker registries like docker.io and quay.io are public endpoints for browsing and fetching OCI images. You can also run a private registry yourself! The registry API is standardized here and the most ubiquitous open-source implementation is available here. Registries can work with myriad data stores, but in practice, they all just run on a comfy and reliable S3-compatible object store. It's cheap, it's persistent, it scales to infinity (if you're willing to renegotiate the \"it's cheap\" claim), but there's one major flaw. Querying arbitrary information about the stored images (e.g. \"list all image repositories in this registry, please\") is either:\n\nWouldn't the world be a tad more beautiful if there was a registry you can actually query? Let's implement one!\n\nThe OCI distribution specification is based on HTTP. It lists all endpoints that a conformant implementation must support, along with their legal methods and status codes for success and failure:\n\nThe REST paths are rather self-descriptive, modulo the cryptic \"referrers\" with an even more cryptic definition: \"a list of manifests with a subject relationship to a specified digest.\" Let's forget about these for now. The most important part is storing layers (a.k.a. blobs) and all kinds of metadata about images, their layers, versions, tags, etc. I described the OCI image format in more detail in this post.\n\nHow does the official implementation handle all the data management? It can be summed up as \"let's squeeze absolutely everything in S3.\" That applies both to data (OCI layers) and metadata (OCI manifests, tags, uploads, etc). It also makes the registry service extremely lightweight, as it doesn't keep any data itself. It really is barely more than syntactic sugar over the S3 API. The standard also specifies that it's fine to return an HTTP redirect response, which can be used to send presigned S3 requests. Then, users can fetch data from S3 directly. The storage layout is straightforward – data is kept in one prefix, metadata in another.\n\nSimple and brilliant, because everything is stored in a single place with high reliability guarantees. It's also what makes querying so bothersome: most interesting inquiries need to scan a huge S3 bucket. That's inefficient in two important ways: it’s slow and it’s expensive.\n\nWhat if we keep metadata somewhere else? Enter SQLite.\n\nThe OCI distribution format can be translated to a simple SQL schema. It can look roughly like this:\n\nPublishing an image boils down to uploading the layers to an object store and updating the metadata:\n\nKeeping information in SQLite is easy, because it's just a file. An OCI registry is a distributed system, though, so how can you store everything in a file and pretend it's scalable? A key observation is that we can store metadata in a \"write-through\" manner. Save everything in SQLite alright, but also store it in S3, just like the original implementation does. You can then treat SQLite as a fast-yet-powerfully-queryable cache.\n\nWhat if you lose the file or it becomes corrupt?\n\nFirst of all, since all the metadata is preserved in S3, the registry can scan the whole bucket and recreate the metadata structure in SQLite. That may take a few centuries for a large repository, but is only done sparingly – ideally once. The ability to bootstrap from an existing object store bucket also makes the registry a \"drop-in replacement™,\" as tech companies love to describe their products.\n\nNow that an SQLite-as-a-Service company (Turso) has entered the market, we can offload the complicated backup and replication bits to them, while still having a simple local file to manage.

    "title": "Quotes from Marcus Aurelius' Meditations Explained",
    "description": "Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations have made the Roman emperor equally respected as a Stoic philosopher. What do some of his most important quotes mean?",
    "fullText": "Published: Sep 25, 2025written by Tony Najjar, BA Philosophy (In-Progress), BA Earth & Life Sciences\n\nMarcus Aurelius’ Meditations is no ordinary philosophy treatise. Written by the 2nd-century CE Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the “Meditations” were not an organized text edited for publication, but a collection of the emperor’s philosophical thoughts and reflections as he sought clarity, resilience, and patience while ruling Rome’s mighty empire. They were only discovered and published centuries after his death. A follower of Stoic philosophy, his words have been embraced as practical lessons on how to achieve goals, overcome obstacles, and live a good life. Let’s look at five of the emperor’s most important quotes from the Meditations and the wisdom they contain.\n\n“Our actions may be impeded… but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” (Meditations 5.20)\n\nMarcus Aurelius frames obstacles and opportunities, suggesting that you should not get discouraged when you encounter a bump in the road. He suggests that obstacles can sometimes give us clarity on a better way to move forward, as they force us to keep digging. Obstacles can lead people to find inner strength and realize that they are capable of things they previously thought impossible. They also develop character in the face of setbacks, helping people become better human beings.\n\nThe author suggests that it is best to work with obstacles rather than resist and maintain a positive attitude when faced with difficulties. Instead of seeing obstacles as scary, they should be embraced as an opportunity to learn and grow. This is how you find the right path. If everything was easy, what’s the point of pursuing it anyway? It is the inner joy found while overcoming obstacles that contributes to a truly purposeful life.\n\n“To watch the course of the stars as if you revolved with them. To keep constantly in mind how the elements alter into one another. Thoughts like this wash off the mud of life below.” (Meditations 7.47)\n\nHere, Marcus Aurelius suggests that when you are feeling overwhelmed, it is a good idea to put your problems in perspective. He encourages individuals to imagine themselves running with the stars while appreciating the universe with astonishment, to realize that their problems are not as significant as they imagine. This exercise can help to reduce negative thoughts and encourage a sense of humility.\n\nThe Stoic Emperor also shares the reminder that change is the natural condition of the universe. He explains that nothing lasts forever; everything will transform and change. Remembering how seasons change, for example, or how the storm will sooner or later be replaced by the bright sun with its warm rays, is comforting. Anyone can benefit from keeping in mind that the adversity they are facing will end; change is inevitable.\n\n“If you seek tranquility, do less. Or (more accurately) do what’s essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way.\n\nWhich brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’\n\nBut we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow.” (Meditations 4.24)\n\nHere, Marcus Aurelius suggests that we can gain more tranquility in life by doing less, by not doing the things that are not essential. This minimalism not only reduces stress, but gives you the capacity to do the things that matter better, increasing the satisfaction in doing the things that matter.\n\nThis feels like a lesson for the modern world in which many people We are often made to feel guilty if we are not doing something productive all the time. This need to be busy means that we often fill our lives with things that are unnecessary. Marcus Aurelius suggests that this leads us to waste time on things that don’t matter, and reduce our ability to engage with the things that do.\n\nHis advice is to be careful how we spend our time, eliminating things that are unnecessary and prioritizing the things that truly matter to us. In this way, we are valuing our time and energy in the most beneficial way. But he suggests that this approach should not only extend to what we do, but also how we think. Don’t waste time on judging others when you could be focused on your own challenges.\n\n“To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it too, if you simply recognize that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.” (Meditations 7.22)\n\nThis passage emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and understanding. Marcus Aurelius suggests that we try to feel sympathy for people who have wronged others and understand what is behind their actions. For example, if you encounter someone who is incredibly rude, it may be that you are meeting them on the worst day of their life, and stress is causing their behavior. Therefore, try to be empathetic before passing judgment.\n\nMarcus Aurelius also talks about death in this passage. He is saying that both these people will die soon; so, what’s the point of getting angry or upset? Some people might see this as pessimistic, but Marcus Aurelius is highlighting that whatever you are upset about won’t matter for very long.\n\nThe Stoic emperor also suggests that while another person’s actions might feel hurtful, their actions don’t control how we choose to respond. The freedom and responsibility of our response lies with us. This is one of the most powerful teachings of the Stoics: we choose our thoughts and actions, and therefore create the world in which we live.\n\n“He does only what is his to do and considers constantly what the world has in store for him—doing his best and trusting that all is for the best. For we carry our fate with us—and it carries us.” (Meditations 3.4)\n\nHere, Marcus Aurelius talks about doing the tasks required of the person while staying curious and maintaining a positive attitude toward life. The individual is encouraged to care only about what will bring him to the achievement of his goals, one step at a time. He should not care about what others are doing unless people ask for his help.\n\nWhile the emperor suggests focused action, he also promotes curiosity. When you stay curious and constantly strive to discover the world, you will start to notice the opportunities.\n\nHe also suggests embracing a positive attitude and expecting good things to happen. Even when faced with adversity, remember that something good will come out of it in the end. He suggests that a wise person understands that everything happens for a reason.\n\nThe Meditations of Marcus Aurelius contain much more wisdom from Stoic philosophy. The Stoics believed in the importance of daily reflection and writing down philosophical teachings and principles to keep them in mind and live by them. This seems to have been Marcus Aurelius’s aim in writing his Meditations.",

    "title": "Tacit: We Know More Than We Can Tell",
    "description": "We know more than we can tell",
    "fullText": "In 1291, all glassmakers who lived in Venice were ordered to move to Murano, a cluster of seven tiny nearby islands. The exile was protective: it kept trade secrets contained and reduced the fire risk to the city’s wooden buildings. For five centuries, Murano’s workshops thrived. Then Napoleon conquered Venice in 1797 and dismantled the guild system. Within a generation, the industry had collapsed. Once that intergenerational chain was broken, the knowledge of how to create Murano glass could not be easily revived.\n\nThis kind of knowledge, what the philosopher Michael Polanyi called “tacit,” resists instruction. You can read about riding a bicycle, but you only truly learn by trying (and falling). You can follow a recipe for crème brûlée, but you only learn how the custard should settle—the particular wobble that means done, not the wobble that means wait—by overbaking a few. This is the kind of knowledge that is difficult to describe, easy to recognize, and nearly impossible to fake.\n\nThe mechanism for developing tacit knowledge is straightforward but slow: repeated practice that gradually moves skills from conscious effort to automatic execution. The mechanism for transmitting it is even slower: apprenticeship, where a learner works alongside someone experienced, observing and imitating until their own judgment develops. This is why tacit knowledge often concentrates in lineages, unbroken chains of practitioners passing expertise to the next generation.\n\nAI has elevated the distinction between what is tacit and what is not. Language models can summarize and automate, but when they attempt to create something that carries the signature of human craft, the result is often flat. Cedric Chin, a Singaporean analyst and one of the inspirations for this series, describes the process of acquiring tacit knowledge as the process of moving from conscious incompetence, to conscious competence, to, finally, unconscious competence.\n\nThe ceiling for LLMs, for now, seems to be conscious competence. They can capture and articulate procedure (or at least the median advice on any particular topic), but not judgment.\n\nAn illustrative example: I asked ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini each to design a fragrance that captures the scent of “jasmine just blooming on the vine on the west coast of California.” Each gave me a tidy list of top, middle, and bottom notes, with varying degrees of specificity and complexity. All featured Jasmine sambac absolute, the widely-accepted best substitute for jasmine on the vine, but none contained anything particularly surprising (I am not a perfumer, but I am a prolific Fragrantica user, and the LLM-generated fragrances all seemed suspiciously like perfumes I’ve smelled before).\n\nThis exercise seems abstract, but it’s paralleled by a real scene from the second episode of Tacit, which features Christophe Laudamiel, master perfumer at Osmo and the creator of fragrances from Polo Blue to Abercrombie Fierce.\n\nChristophe could explain what he was doing, and sometimes he did. But most of the time he just did it. Fingal Ferguson, the master knifemaker profiled in the first episode of Tacit, noted that muscle memory is a knifemaker’s tool of instinct. It’s a perfumer’s too, and with Christophe it showed up as a mostly-silent sequence. For hours we watched him smell, pause, and write, over and over again.\n\nWe made this series for two reasons.\n\nThe first is straightforward: nearly everything worth paying attention to was made by someone who cared deeply about their craft. Caring enough to pursue mastery over years is how tacit knowledge develops. We wanted to capture that care in action.\n\nThe second is that tacit knowledge is also economically foundational. For years Stripe Press has published books arguing that seemingly marginal improvements compound into the forces that determine whether societies become rich or stay poor. Most recently, The Origins of Efficiency showed that production improvements—the accumulated know-how of companies refining and scaling processes—is what made goods cheaper over time, which is the basic story of economic growth. Our next book, Maintenance: of Everything, makes the same case for the upkeep required to keep the complex systems that we depend on running.\n\nTacit knowledge and its accumulation (or, alternatively, deterioration) is another seemingly trivial but ultimately important determinant of economic outcomes. When tacit knowledge chains break, entire industries can collapse. The collapse of the British shipbuilding industry in the late 1950s, decline of the Swiss watchmaking industry in the 1970s (until its eventual revival a decade later), and the disappearance of Murano glass until the mid-19th century are all examples of this phenomenon.\n\nTacit, though, is our attempt to make a serious study of what tacit knowledge looks like at the individual level. It is a series of vignettes of people with deep, earned expertise, captured in the act of working. The things we can formalize—write down, measure, automate—turn out to be a surprisingly small subset of what we know how to do. The rest lives in trained judgment and practiced skill.\n\nThis kind of knowledge is difficult to capture on film. But we tried anyway. Our hope is that watching their mastery, even briefly, imperfectly rendered, helps you recognize your own.\n\nTamara Winter, Commissioning Editor, Stripe Press",

    "title": "The evolution of expendability: Why some ants traded armor for numbers",
    "description": "Ants with lots of workers tend to put less energy into making them armored.",
    "fullText": "The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.\n\nTheir study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.\n\nIn the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.\n\n“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”\n\nEconomo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.\n\nTo test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.\n\nMicrotomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”\n\nTo solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.\n\nThe first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.\n\nThe team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.\n\nAnts that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.\n\n“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”\n\nThe researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.\n\nIn a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.\n\n“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.\n\nThe study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.\n\nBefore looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.\n\nScience Advances. 2025.

    "description": "The 6th Circuit, relying on the Supreme Court’s Loper Bright decision, ruled that the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order reclassifying broadband as a tele",
    "fullText": "Update as of January 2, 2025: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a decision on the consolidated petitions for review of the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order. In its January 2 decision, which relies heavily on principles articulated in Loper Bright, the court held that the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service misinterpreted the text of the Communications Act, and therefore the FCC's reclassification exceeded its statutory authority.\n\nInstead, the court held that in offering consumers the capability of retrieving information via telecommunications, ISPs offer an information service and that mobile broadband is not interconnected with the PTSN and is therefore a private mobile service not subject to common carrier regulation. Moreover, given its ruling, the court did not address whether the major questions doctrine also barred the FCC's reclassification. Finally, because the Open Internet Order was already stayed by the 6th Circuit last August, there is no immediate impact and, with the pending change in administration and FCC leadership in less than three weeks, it is unlikely the government will seek any further review through panel or en banc rehearing or certiorari to the Supreme Court, although certain of the intervenors supporting reclassification could.\n\nRead our latest advisory for more about the decision and key takeaways. The original advisory from June 6, 2024, appears below.\n\nOn May 7, 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued its latest network neutrality order, Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet (the \"Order\"), which was published in the Federal Register on May 22, 2024, making it mostly effective July 22, 2024. This massive document (more than 500 single-spaced pages in all) reinstates, with a few significant modifications, the network neutrality rules that the agency had previously imposed in 2015 (in the Open Internet Order), but which were set aside in 2017 (in the Restoring Internet Freedom, or RIF Order, and the Order on Remand, when the agency shifted from Democratic to Republican control following the 2016 election). Parties have asked the FCC to stay the Order and filed Petitions for Review challenging the Order in court.\n\nThe Order takes the following key steps (discussed in more detail below):\n\nIn broad strokes, the FCC's decisions in the Order – from the legal logic of the classification of BIAS as a telecommunications service, to the content of the new rules, to the exceptions from generally applicable telecommunications regulations – are the same as in the agency's 2015 Open Internet Order. We discuss the most important of those re-created rulings below. In addition, there are some interesting and potentially significant differences between this order and the 2015 Open Internet Order, which we also discuss below.\n\nAs noted above, the Order is extremely lengthy and detailed. We strongly recommend that BIAS providers and other interested parties carefully review the Order and consult with counsel about how the rulings in the Order may affect their decisions and operations going forward. With that caveat, however, set out below is a more in-depth discussion of the Order's key holdings.\n\nThe FCC first adopted a transparency rule in 2010, requiring BIAS providers to disclose accurate information about network management practices, network performance, and commercial terms (pricing, etc.). The FCC reaffirmed that rule in the 2015 Open Internet Order. In the 2017 RIF Order, the FCC modified the rule somewhat. The Order reinstates the 2015 rule.\n\nThe transparency rule requires BIAS providers to disclose information \"sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use of such services.\" The 2017 version, from the RIF Order, states that the information must be sufficient for \"entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings.\" The rule in the Order specifies that disclosures must be sufficient for \"content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.\"\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order eliminated the requirement that BIAS providers disclose information about packet loss on their networks, but the Order reinstates that obligation.\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order permitted providers to disclose network performance (such as actually achieved data rates) on a reasonably aggregated basis. The Order requires that reported performance must be geographically disaggregated so that a consumer in a given area can learn what to reasonably expect from a BIAS offering. Moreover, the Order requires disclosure of performance over a reasonable period of time and during times of peak usage so that consumers will know how the provider's network performs under conditions of maximum congestion. The Order does not, however, require disclosure of the source, location, timing, or duration of network congestion.\n\nThe obligations to report packet loss and geographically granular performance will not apply to BIAS providers with 100,000 or fewer customers.\n\nThe Order also requires that BIAS providers make their disclosures on the BIAS provider's website and not simply report them to the Commission (which was an option under the 2017 RIF Order). Moreover, the disclosures must be in machine-readable format, such as a .csv file, to facilitate consumers comparing the reported performance of different BIAS providers.\n\nFinally, the Order reinstates the requirement from the 2015 Open Internet Order that BIAS providers give consumers direct notice that their usage is about to trigger a change in performance level (e.g., a rate limitation after the consumer has used up their data allowance). As with packet loss and granular geographic reporting, this requirement does not apply to BIAS providers with 100,000 or fewer customers.\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order did not forbid blocking or throttling and so did not need to impose a carve-out for \"reasonable network management.\" The Order reinstates the no-blocking and no-throttling rules and so also reinstates the carve-out from those rules for \"reasonable network management.\" This exception will only apply to practices that have a \"primarily technical network management justification,\" rather than a justification based on \"other business practices.\" The no-blocking rule also prohibits BIAS providers from charging edge providers a fee to avoid having edge providers' content, services, or applications blocked from reaching BIAS providers' end-user customers.\n\nIf a technical justification exists, the FCC will assess whether a network management practice is reasonable based on the specific technology of a BIAS provider's network. Landline, mobile, and satellite BIAS providers will be able to adopt practices that make sense considering the constraints of their individual network technologies. The FCC specifically states that providers may implement practices needed for network security and that block traffic unwanted by end users (such as spam or malware) and does not prevent or restrict a BIAS provider from refusing to transmit unlawful material, such as child sexual abuse material or copyright-infringing materials. The FCC will consider (that is, view more leniently) practices for managing congestion that only apply during times of actual congestion. Congestion management practices should be \"as application-agnostic as possible.\"\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order purported to broadly preempt state-level regulation of broadband. However, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the FCC could not preempt state regulation when the theory of the RIF Order was that the FCC lacked regulatory authority over broadband in the first place.\n\nThe Order takes a different approach, stating that it will preempt \"any state or local measures that interfere or are incompatible with the federal regulatory framework we establish today.\" However, the FCC will undertake preemption on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the FCC notes that different states may legitimately impose different requirements regarding (for example) \"customer relationships and billing practices.\" In this regard, the FCC expressly declined to preempt California's \"Internet Consumer Protection and Network Neutrality Act of 2018\" on the ground that the law tracked the rules and requirements of the 2015 Open Internet Order that were set aside by the 2017 RIF Order and thus largely \"mirror or parallel\" the new Order's rules.\n\nThe Order's case-by-case approach to preemption could be problematic in that it may encourage states to impose potentially onerous regulations on BIAS providers under the rubric of consumer protection, in the hope that the regulations will either not be challenged or will survive a preemption attack at the FCC. It remains to be seen how this concern will play out in practice.\n\nEven while imposing net neutrality rules on BIAS providers – which, at a high level, boil down to fulfilling the basic common carrier obligations of nondiscrimination and reasonable conduct – the FCC did not want to impose most of the other, detailed obligations the Communications Act and the agency's own rules impose on telecommunications carriers. So, just as it did in the 2015 Open Internet Order, in the Order the FCC used its authority under Section 10 of the Act to \"forbear\" from applying a wide swath of those obligations.\n\nHere are the key regulatory obligations to which BIAS providers will not be subject under the Order (at least for now):\n\nWhile the FCC exempted BIAS providers from the provisions noted above, it determined that it would not forbear from applying certain other obligations of telecommunications carriers. The key obligations that will apply to BIAS providers are:\n\nIn addition to the specific statutory privacy obligations established by Section 222 of the Act governing the confidentiality of voice service-related \"customer proprietary network information\" (\"CPNI\"), the FCC has interpreted Section 222(a) and the general \"reasonableness\" requirement of Section 201(b) as establishing a general requirement for carriers to protect the confidentiality of customer information that does not fall under the definition of CPNI. Relying on these two statutory provisions, the agency recently promulgated detailed and potentially onerous data security and data breach reporting obligations on all traditional telecommunications carriers. The Order waives those specific rules, at least for now, for BIAS providers. In the meantime, providers have challenged the data security and data breach rules in the Sixth Circuit, arguing that Section 222 does not provide the FCC with authority to regulate customer privacy other than with respect to CPNI.\n\nOne reason for exempting BIAS providers from the new rules is that the agency did not have BIAS providers in mind when it formulated those rules. Beyond that, however, the agency seems to be pursuing some other goals as well.\n\nFirst, as noted above, for some time the agency has contended that Section 222(a) imposes a general obligation to protect customer information, separate and apart from the specific obligation on carriers to protect CPNI. The Order reasserts that view, which many industry participants dispute.\n\nSecond, the agency also contends that it has authority to impose privacy and data security obligations under the general \"just and reasonable\" standard in Section 201, which, again, many industry participants dispute.\n\nThird, in the wake of the 2015 Open Internet Order, in 2016 the agency separately issued an order (the \"2016 Privacy Order\") along with a set of detailed and onerous privacy rules specifically applicable to BIAS providers, relying on Sections 222(a) and 201(b) as authority. This action proved so controversial that Congress invoked the seldom-used Congressional Review Act (CRA) to invalidate those BIAS-specific privacy rules in 2017. Under the CRA, the invalidation of the old rules means that the agency may not adopt new rules that are \"substantially the same\" as the old ones without further authorization from Congress. By exempting BIAS providers from the agency's recently-adopted data security rules and leaving BIAS privacy issues to case-by-case adjudication under Section 201(b) and Section 222(a), and giving BIAS providers \"leeway in the details of how they go about complying with those obligations to a materially greater extent than the much more prescriptive 2016 rules,\" the Order attempts to protect this aspect of its holdings from CRA-based attacks. It remains to be seen whether this protection will prove sufficient on appeal.\n\nThe Order restores Section 224 pole attachment protections to BIAS-only providers, including both wireline and wireless providers, giving them the same rights as cable system operators and telecommunications service providers to non-discriminatory access to investor owned utility poles guaranteed by Section 224(f). In addition, ISPs attaching to such poles in 26 states where pole attachment rates, terms and conditions are regulated by the FCC may now avail themselves of FCC rules which, among other things, establish pole access timelines, limit pole attachment rates and allocation of pole-related costs, and establish procedures for resolving pole attachment disputes.\n\nMoreover, the classification will automatically apply in two \"reverse preemption\" states that have adopted FCC pole attachment rules outright (Pennsylvania and West Virginia) and in states that have limited preemption of the FCC's regulation to cable television system access. Notably, some of the remaining states that have reverse preempted the FCC already have extended their rules to cover broadband service providers. Other reverse preemption states may choose to amend their laws to ensure that their pole attachment rules cover BIAS providers.\n\nIn response to comments filed by the California Public Utility Commission, the FCC also declared that reclassification provides states with the requisite legal authority to protect public safety concerns associated with broadband-only infrastructure. While this may bolster a state's ability to extend existing regulations to broadband, a state's ability to do so will also depend on the specific state laws governing this area.\n\nSection 253 of the Act (for any telecommunications carrier) and Section 332 of the Act (for wireless carriers) protect against state or local governments taking actions that unduly interfere with the ability of a carrier to enter a market and offer its services, including, specifically, unreasonable or discriminatory restrictions on access to public rights-of-way for placing communications facilities. With reclassification, BIAS providers may now seek FCC or court intervention under those provisions when state or local regulations effectively prohibit the provision of BIAS services including by restricting competitive deployment.\n\nThe FCC concluded that reclassification of BIAS means that the agency's rules regarding the provision of telecommunications or cable services in MTEs (such as apartment and office buildings) now apply to BIAS-only providers. According to the FCC, it may now require BIAS-only providers to comply with the same requirements that apply to telecommunications and cable providers in MTEs, including rules that prohibit exclusive access and service contracts, as well as \"graduated revenue sharing\" where the landlord/owner receives greater compensation as the percentage of residents taking the service rises.\n\nBecause BIAS is now classified as a telecommunications service, BIAS services and equipment must be made accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with Part 6 of the FCC rules. As noted by the FCC, people who are deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, or have speech disabilities increasingly rely on IP-based video conferencing services to communicate. These services, like IP-based video relay service, require multiparty synchronous high definition video to accommodate sign language communication. Practically speaking, this means that BIAS providers may not adopt network management practices that have the effect of degrading the connections carrying video communications of persons with hearing and disabilities, such as blocking or throttling, bandwidth limits, data caps, or requirements to pay additional fees to obtain sufficient capacity. It also means that the means for accessing BIAS and any customer support for BIAS, including bills and technical support, must also be accessible to persons with disabilities.\n\nIn the 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC described the extension of its accessibility rules to BIAS as essentially already covered by its accessibility rules governing Advanced Communications Services (\"ACS\"). The current Order, however, acknowledges a distinction, stating clearly for first time that BIAS is not ACS. Notably, BIAS, like traditional telecom and interconnected VoIP services, is subject to a lower standard of achievement (\"readily achievable,\" i.e., accomplishable without much difficulty or expense) than applies to ACS (\"achievable,\" i.e., with reasonable effort or expense). However, video conferencing services that rely upon BIAS are a form of ACS, so this may be a distinction without a purpose.\n\nThe main policy justification for reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service in the 2015 Open Internet Order was that broadband providers had the incentive and ability to interfere with people's ability to access the online content they wanted. Expressly barring BIAS providers from such interference would protect the \"virtuous cycle\" of innovation by edge providers driving demand for broadband, leading to increased investment in broadband infrastructure.\n\nThe Order certainly mentions the importance of the \"virtuous cycle\" but does not emphasize it. Instead, the policy focus of the Order is that treating BIAS as a telecommunications service will allow the FCC to protect national security, promote cybersecurity, enhance public safety, monitor and enhance network resiliency and reliability, and protect consumer privacy and data security.\n\nThis shift in policy emphasis does not directly affect the agency's legal analysis underlying the Order's reclassification of broadband. At the same time, this shift is not merely cosmetic. Whatever may have been true a decade ago, today the Internet is so deeply embedded in the country's cultural, political, and economic life – and the international environment is so much more tense – that the risks of leaving this critical infrastructure unmonitored and unregulated are, from the agency's perspective, too great. The time since the Open Internet Order has seen a vast increase in remote work, remote learning, and remote healthcare – driven by the COVID-19 pandemic – all of which depend on a robust, resilient, reliable Internet. During that same time, the FCC has banned the use of certain Chinese equipment in United States telecommunications networks and barred certain Chinese entities from owning those networks. Classifying broadband as a telecommunications service is the most straightforward and direct way under existing law to bring broadband networks under federal supervision.\n\nThis shift in policy emphasis also constitutes a form of \"political insurance\" for reclassification if Republicans retake control of the agency following the 2024 election. The 2015 Open Internet Order was framed as an exercise of economic and consumer protection regulation, which made it an easy target for a deregulation-minded Republican-controlled FCC. But even if a new Republican majority in 2025 is skeptical of the need to regulate BIAS to protect consumers and encourage investment, promoting national security and protecting critical infrastructure against foreign adversaries – the focus of the Order – are likely to retain bipartisan appeal. The shift in policy emphasis in the Order may make it less likely that a future Commission would reverse the reclassification of broadband as a telecommunications service.\n\nEvery major court decision addressing an FCC ruling classifying broadband either as a telecommunications service or as an information service has expressly and heavily relied on the Chevron doctrine, under which courts defer to an agency's interpretation of its own statute if that interpretation is, broadly speaking, reasonable. The Supreme Court in Brand X relied on Chevron to uphold the FCC's then-current classification of cable broadband as an information service. The D.C. Circuit in USTA relied on Chevron to uphold the FCC's 2015 reclassification of broadband, in the Open Internet Order, as a telecommunications service. And the D.C. Circuit in Mozilla relied on Chevron to uphold (for the most part) the FCC's 2017 second reclassification of broadband, in the RIF Order, as (again) an information service.\n\nIf Chevron remains good law, courts may view the Order as reflecting a reasonable reading of the definitions in the Communications Act as applied to broadband – just as occurred with the 2015 Open Internet Order – and defer to the Commission's reclassification. But it is widely anticipated that the current Supreme Court, perhaps even this term, will cut back on the scope of Chevron. If that happens, reviewing courts may be less likely to defer and instead would have more leeway to determine not just whether the FCC's current interpretation of the Act is broadly reasonable, but also whether that interpretation represents the \"best\" or \"correct\" reading of the law. Anticipating this possibility, the Order takes great pains to explain why, in the agency's view, its reading of the law is not only reasonable but is, in fact, correct – an apparent effort to protect its reclassification decision against the possible demise of Chevron.\n\nIn this regard, while opponents of excessive regulation generally favor cutting back on Chevron, here a victory on that issue could be a double-edged sword. If Chevron is no longer good law, and if it turns out that the courts agree with the FCC that the Communications Act requires treating broadband as a telecommunications service, this would limit the ability of even a future conservative, deregulation-minded FCC to reclassify and deregulate broadband service.\n\nSince the time of the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order, the Supreme Court has, on several occasions, clarified and expanded the major question doctrine, which says that agencies are not permitted to interpret a broad, general grant of authority as including the power to decide \"major questions\" – that is, questions with \"vast economic and political significance.\" Under this doctrine, for an agency to address such questions requires express authorization from Congress. Some opponents of classifying broadband as a telecommunications service argued before the FCC that this would constitute action on a \"major question,\" which, they argue, is a step the agency may not take because Congress has not expressly authorized it.\n\nThe Order rejects that claim, for several reasons. It argues that the major question doctrine does not apply to this decision at all, since regulating communications networks is the agency's core function. It notes that Congress has not provided any guidance on the question of classification of Internet access (both broadband and dial-up) even though the agency has addressed the issue in a range of contexts since at least 1998; according to the Order, this indicates that Congress is content to leave the issue to the agency's discretion. And the agency argues that treating broadband as a telecommunications service simply does not have the \"vast economic and political significance\" required to bring the major question doctrine into play.\n\nGiven the Supreme Court's expansion of the major question doctrine in recent years, it is highly likely that parties opposing the Order will raise this issue as part of their challenges in court.\n\nDWT's communications and privacy and security groups are familiar with all aspects of the new net neutrality regime. Readers should feel free to reach out to us with any questions about how the new rules will apply to or affect BIAS provider operations going forward.",

    "fullText": "Research reveals that artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation cause cellular mutations that can be the seeds of future cancers, including highly deadly melanoma.\n\nTanning bed users are known to have a higher risk of skin cancer, but for the first time researchers have found that young indoor tanners undergo genetic changes that can lead to more mutations in their skin cells than people twice their age.\n\nThe study, which was led by UC San Francisco and Northwestern University, appears Dec. 12 in Science Advances.\n\n“We found that tanning bed users in their 30s and 40s had even more mutations than people in the general population who were in their 70s and 80s,” said Bishal Tandukar, PhD, a UCSF postdoctoral scholar in Dermatology who is the co-first author of the study. “In other words, the skin of tanning bed users appeared decades older at the genetic level.”\n\nSuch mutations can lead to skin cancer, which is the most common cancer in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. Among those skin cancers is melanoma, which accounts for only about 1% of skin cancers but causes most of the deaths. About 11,000 Americans die annually from melanoma, primarily from exposure to ultraviolet radiation.\n\nUV radiation occurs naturally in sunlight, as well as in artificial light sources like tanning beds. Rates of melanoma have risen along with the use of tanning beds in recent years, disproportionately affecting young women, who are the main clients of the tanning industry.\n\nNumerous countries effectively ban tanning beds, and the World Health Organization classifies them as a group 1 carcinogen, the same category as tobacco smoke and asbestos, but tanning beds remain legal and popular in the U.S.\n\nIn their study, the authors looked at the medical records of more than 32,000 dermatology patients including their tanning bed usage, history of sunburn, and family history of melanoma. They also obtained skin samples from 26 donors and sequenced 182 cells.\n\nThe young tanning bed users had more skin mutations than people twice their age, especially in their lower backs, an area that does not get much damage from sunlight but has a great deal of exposure from tanning beds.\n\n“The skin of tanning bed users was riddled with the seeds of cancer — cells with mutations known to lead to melanoma,” said senior author A. Hunter Shain, PhD, associate professor in the UCSF Department of Dermatology.\n\n“We cannot reverse a mutation once it occurs, so it is essential to limit how many mutations accumulate in the first place,” said Shain, whose laboratory focuses on the biology of skin cancer. “One of the simplest ways to do that is to avoid exposure to artificial UV radiation.”\n\nAuthors: From UCSF, authors include Delahny Deivendran; Limin Chen, PhD; Jessica Tang, PhD; Tuyet Tan; Harsh Sharma, PhD; Aravind K.

    "description": "England's Bazball regime is in tatters as yet another Ashes series in Australia is lost at the earliest possible opportunity.",
    "fullText": "Third Ashes Test, Adelaide Oval (day five of five)\n\nAustralia 371: Carey 106; Archer 5-53 & 349: Head 170; Tongue 4-70\n\nEngland 286: Stokes 83; Boland 3-45 & 352: Crawley 85; Cummins 3-48\n\nAustralia won by 82 runs, lead five-match series 3-0\n\nEngland's Bazball project is in tatters as yet another Ashes in Australia was lost in three Tests.\n\nThe tourists were defeated by 82 runs on the fifth day of the third Test in Adelaide to go 3-0 down and extend a winless run in this country to 18 matches.\n\nAustralia were delayed by a 40-minute rain shower, England pair Jamie Smith and Will Jacks, and a hamstring injury to spinner Nathan Lyon.\n\nSmith had 60 when he miscued Mitchell Starc. Jacks battled past lunch for his 47 then edged the same bowler to first slip, where Marnus Labuschagne again took a breathtaking catch.\n\nWhen Josh Tongue edged Scott Boland to Labuschagne, England were all out for 352 and their misery in this country prolonged to 14 years and counting.\n\nThis was supposed to be England's opportunity to finally compete in Australia, the most highly-anticipated Ashes in recent memory.\n\nInstead it has turned into the worst tour in recent times, leaving the futures of captain Ben Stokes, head coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key in doubt.\n\nEngland have surrendered the chance to win the Ashes in only 11 days of cricket and now must find a result in either Melbourne or Sydney to avoid the ultimate humiliation of a 5-0 clean sweep.\n\nThis is the fourth successive Ashes tour in which England have lost the first three Tests. By the time Australia visit the UK in 2027, it will be 12 years since England's previous Ashes win.\n\nWho is in charge of England by then will come in for intense debate. Stokes and McCullum have contracts until the end of that series. In theory, Key has most sway over the fate of both men, but is probably under more pressure than either.\n\nThis is a stunning win for the Australians, who began the series with questions over selection and the age of their squad.\n\nCaptain Pat Cummins missed the first two Tests, Josh Hazlewood is out for the entire series, Lyon was omitted for the second Test and Steve Smith is absent in Adelaide.\n\nAustralia have still been far too good for England, as they have been on home turf since 2011.\n\n'I put my hands up' - McCullum admits Ashes mistakes\n\n'Test career over for now?' - Ashes player ratings\n\nThe 10 moments that decided the Ashes\n\nStokes said this tour was the chance for his England team to \"create history\", while McCullum declared the Ashes could \"define\" the group.\n\nEngland will be defined as losers in this country, their history entwined with all the other Ashes tourists to be humbled down under.\n\nThe Bazball ideology has been exposed by Australia's hard-nosed, ruthless and relentless Test cricket. There was always suspicion, even derision, in this country of England's style of play, despite a 2-2 draw in the UK two years ago. Australia have been proved right.\n\nEngland's selection, preparation and method have all been found wanting. This tour will be remembered for showing disdain to warm-up matches, a holiday in Noosa and Stokes talking about \"weak men\" in his dressing room.\n\nArchitects of their own downfall in the first two Tests, England improved in Adelaide, yet still committed too many errors.\n\nThe tourists went into the game without a specialist spinner, dropped Usman Khawaja on the first morning, and Ollie Pope and Harry Brook were guilty of poor shots in the first and second innings respectively. In England's defence, they did get the wrong end of the Alex Carey Snicko controversy.\n\nThe 5-0 embarrassment looks unavoidable. Pope will surely be left out of the fourth Test in Melbourne, although England's only reserve batter is Jacob Bethell – a 22-year-old still to score a first-class hundred.\n\nShoaib Bashir was chosen to be England's first-choice spinner and looks unselectable. Matthew Potts and Matthew Fisher are the two seamers yet to play in this series, though neither would be in the squad if other bowlers were fit and available.\n\nAshes defeats in Australia usually mean sweeping changes to an England regime and the bloodletting will soon begin. Before then, things could get much worse on the field.\n\nAustralia were billed as ageing, ravaged by injuries and struggling to settle on an opening partnership.\n\nMight this series have turned out differently had Travis Head not been promoted to open in place of the injured Khawaja for the second innings of the first Test in Perth? Head's match-winning century was one of the great Ashes moments and gave Australia momentum they have not relinquished.\n\nStarc's bowling decimated England in the first two Tests – covering for Cummins and Hazlewood almost single-handedly. Carey is putting together one of the greatest exhibitions of glovework seen by a wicketkeeper in a single series.\n\nCummins was in danger of missing the series because of a back injury but hastened his rehabilitation to return in Adelaide. Despite not bowling a ball since July, the captain was outstanding.\n\nIn what will certainly be the last home Ashes for a number of these players, they will now set their sights on joining the three other Australia teams to have inflicted 5-0 annihilations of the English.\n\nAfter that comes the return series in the UK in the summer of 2027 and the final frontier of winning an away Ashes – something Australia have not achieved since 2001.\n\nInjured spinner Lyon a doubt for rest of Ashes\n\nEngland began the day on 207-6, 228 away from pulling off the highest successful chase in Test history. Admission prices were cut, though the Adelaide Oval was only one-third full.\n\nSmith swiped two sixes over the leg side before the rain break and there was concern when Jacks rolled his ankle setting off for a single.\n\nSmith continued to attack with crisp drives following the resumption, while Lyon left after making a diving stop on the fine-leg boundary and is now a doubt for the rest of the series.\n\nAustralia took the second new ball and Smith reached his first Ashes half-century by driving Cummins back over his head, only to attempt a shot too many at Starc. Cummins took a fine catch back-pedalling at mid-on to end a seventh-wicket stand of 91.\n\nJacks found a willing ally in Brydon Carse for a partnership of 52. Starc returned after lunch, Jacks edged and, for the second time in the match, Labuschagne swooped low to his left to claim a sensational one-handed grab.\n\nStarc had Jofra Archer cut to deep point, last-man Tongue poked at Boland and the Ashes were secure in Australian hands once more.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Famous singer, songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews took to his band’s TikTok page on Thursday to make a few critical remarks about Donald Trump.\n\nThe six-minute video features Matthews walking around Brooklyn, New York, where he says he’s visiting family.\n\nHe then goes on to talk about how when people talk to themselves now, it’s usually on the phone. He first brings up Trump by mentioning the strikes on the alleged Venezuelan drug boats.\n\n“There’s little evidence to support their actions,” he says in the video. “And pretending its all the fake drugs but really it’s a way to claiming a war against Venezuela so we can steal their oil.”\n\nHe also says the evidence of that is the full pardon of Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who helped funnel cocaine into the United States.\n\n“If you’re fighting drugs, I don’t know if you should be forgiving the guy who brought 10 flat beds of cocaine into the country,” Matthews said.\n\nMatthews also brings up Hilary Clinton, Israel’s actions against Gaza and Trump’s aggressive crackdown on immigration.\n\n“The attacks on immigrants and different populations seems pretty racist,” he said.\n\nHis final remark is on how Trump reacted after the murders of legendary director Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle Reiner.\n\n“What a disgusting human being Donald Trump is. What a shallow, horrifying selfish, greedy, cruel little pig he is,” Matthew said.\n\nMatthews rock band, Dave Matthews Band was formed in 1991 and is expecting to have four performances in Cancun in January.",

    "fullText": "Donovan Metayer was a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida when a gunman opened fire and killed 17 people on Valentine’s Day 2018.\n\nA young man who was a “radiant” child according to family and friends, has died.\n\nDonovan Joshua Leigh Metayer, 26, died on Dec. 15 by suicide. Metayer, who survived the 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, suffered from mental health episodes following the tragic incident and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The shooting occurred during Metayer’s senior year, when most students are thinking about college applications and their life after high school.\n\nBut the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 people, had a profound effect on Metayer and stands as an example of how the trauma of gun violence can linger on for years.\n\nThe youngest child of the Metayer family, Donovan was brilliant from an early age and excelled academically. His humor, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated in his honor, could “light up any room.”\n\nIn the years following the Parkland shooting, Metayer’s dreams of attending college and working in his preferred career field of computer science began to fade. On multiple occasions, he would be hospitalized for suicidal ideation and after one mental health episode in 2021, he was Baker-acted and deemed temporarily unable to purchase a firearm.\n\nYears later, with the help of a private psychiatrist and the Henderson Clinic Metayer began making progress and healing. He’d soon work at Office Depot and earn a promotion and an IT certificate. His mental health journey echoes that of many Black boys across America, masking emotions and not wanting to be seen as a “burden” by family. Treatment, from therapy to medication, may seem like a difficult path thanks to limited resources, social stigmas and more.\n\nHowever, just as Metayer was progressing and gaining more independence according to his family, he soon learned his Risk Protective Order had lapsed.\n\nMetayer then purchased a gun from a gun shop in the area and within a week, he turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn a statement shared on his GoFundMe page, Donovan’s family wrote, ” Donny’s passing is a heartbreaking reminder of the mental health crisis plaguing our youth and the lasting trauma of gun violence on our community. As we grieve his loss, we are breaking the code of silence in his memory. Though Donny’s life was brief, his impact will be everlasting.”\n\nThe family is asking for funds to assist for Metayer’s celebration of life and endow a fund at the Henerson Clinic that will “provide healthcare, housing and hope for people of all ages with behavioral health conditions” throughout the state of Florida.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.\n\n‘They beat our brother’: New York community demands justice after video shows police beating a Black man\n\nRay J has restraining order extended following November arrest, faces 6 misdemeanor charges: ‘I’m missing my kids’\n\nDeaths of Missisippi mom Shardee McGill and 3-year-old daughter determined to be murder-suicide",

    "fullText": "When you grow up Jewish, Santa Claus seems a bit absurd.\n\nI mean, religion requires faith, but believing that a magical old man brought toys to all the Christian kids in the world, riding a flying sleigh, seemed like something most kids would be skeptical of.\n\nIn reality, however, many kids believe until a certain age, and others go along with the ritual because it involves getting presents on Christmas morning.\n\nPart of the Santa Claus ritual has always been getting pictures taken with Jolly Old Saint Nick, sitting on his lap, and telling him what you want for Christmas.\n\nSome kids do that in privately booked photo shoots, while many others head for the mall.\n\nI think most kids know that the mall Santa is more an emissary of the big man than the actual man himself. Still, parents take their kids to meet him, the kids either cry hysterically, or get their pictures taken and gift choices noted before moving on.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nFor about 80 years, for people living in San Francisco, that tradition meant taking their children to Macy's Union Square. It was a time-honored tradition that has lasted for generations, but this year, it won't be happening.\n\nSanta Claus, at least for San Franciscans who enjoy visiting him at Macy's Union Square, won't be coming to town, it seems.\n\nMacy's has quietly ended its tradition of having Santa Claus head from its Thanksgiving Day Parade to its store in Union Square, San Francisco.\n\nThe chain explained that decision in a way that suggests it did not have the option of hiring multiple Santas to visit different stores.\n\n“This year, Macy’s Santa will not be available at our Union Square location. Instead, he will be going on a national tour to visit stores and communities he hasn’t had a chance to appear in before, following his national arrival at the (New York) Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade,” Macy’s officials said in a statement reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nMacy's added that the holiday season magic will continue in Union Square with its SF SPCA Holiday Windows and Macy's Great Tree presented by Ripple.\n\n\"It seems weird without Santa Claus,\" Yvonne Fletcher and her husband, Adrian, told Yahoo News. \"I can't bring my grandkids, and that's what we were waiting for.\"\n\nAbout an 80-year tradition: Santa appeared annually at Macy’s Union Square store, dating back to the store’s opening in the late 1940s and continuing nearly every year until 2025 (excluding the pandemic year), according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nLocal cultural touchstone: Families lined up for visits and photos with Santa each holiday season, making it a cherished Bay Area tradition, the San Francisco Chronicle added.\n\nSame Santa for decades: From roughly 1990 to 2010, the role was played by the beloved “Santa John,” whose appearance became iconic in local family photos, reported Hoodline.\n\nNo Santa in 2025: For the first time in nearly 80 years, Macy’s confirmed Santa won’t be at Union Square this holiday season as he embarks on a national tour after the Thanksgiving parade, shared ABC7 San Francisco.",

    "fullText": "There will be no Cinderella story for Tulane in this year’s College Football Playoff.\n\nFormer BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff and the Green Wave fell 41-10 to the Ole Miss Rebels Saturday in the CFP’s first round, bringing an end to Retzlaff’s eventful but accomplished college career.\n\nRetzlaff completed 20 of 35 passes for 306 yards against the Rebels with a late touchdown pass and a first quarter interception.\n\nTypically a strong running threat, having run for 610 yards and 16 touchdowns this season prior to Saturday, Retzlaff was held to 24 yards on 11 carries by Ole Miss, being sacked twice.\n\nIn 31 career starts at BYU and Tulane, Retzlaff posted a 22-9 record with 6,763 passing yards and 63 total touchdowns.\n\nHe began his college journey at the junior college level before landing in Provo ahead of the 2023 campaign. Retzlaff took over as BYU’s starter for the final four games of the season following an injury to Kedon Slovis, famously becoming the first Jewish starting quarterback in school history.\n\nThough Retzlaff went 0-4 to finish 2023, he won the starting QB job over transfer Gerry Bohanon in 2024 and piloted the Cougars to a 11-2 mark to tie for first place in the Big 12 Conference and capture an Alamo Bowl victory over Colorado.\n\nRetzlaff was expected to start for BYU again in 2025, but a civil lawsuit filed this past May accusing him of sexual assault and battery resulted in his withdrawal from the school and eventual enrollment at Tulane. The case was ultimately dismissed in June.\n\nDespite joining the Green Wave just weeks before the start of fall camp, Retzlaff won the team’s starting quarterback job and powered Tulane to a 10-2 regular season and American Conference championship game win over North Texas, clinching the program’s first-ever CFP appearance.\n\nEarlier this week, ESPN wrote Retzlaff could be selected as high as the sixth round of April’s NFL draft.",

    "fullText": "Who will Ole Miss play next? Explaining the 2025 CFP bracket opponent for Round 2 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe No. 6 Ole Miss Rebels have emphatically answered the question of whether they can win without Lane Kiffin. In their first game since Kiffin left for LSU, and the biggest game in program history, the Rebels delivered a dominant performance at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, crushing the No. 11 Tulane Green Wave 41-10, to advance in the College Football Playoff. New head coach Pete Golding is now 1-0 in his debut, proving the 12-1 Rebels are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe victory showcased the Rebels' strength and determination despite the unusual mid-playoff coaching change. While Tulane allowed Jon Sumrall, the next head coach at Florida, to coach his final contest for the Green Wave, Ole Miss proved that its players were singularly focused on the championship path.\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that Ole Miss's reward for the decisive win is an immediate clash with one of the best coaches and teams in college football. That team is the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs, led by two-time national champion head coach Kirby Smart. Georgia once again steamrolled the competition, finishing the season 12-1 and defeating Alabama to claim its fourth SEC championship under Smart. Entering the playoff, Smart owns a career record of 117-20, cementing Georgia as the preeminent power in the sport.\n\nThe Rebels will now travel to New Orleans to face Georgia in the Sugar Bowl quarterfinal on New Year’s Day. The game is a highly anticipated rematch of their regular-season contest on October 18, which Georgia won 43-35 after rattling off 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to hand Ole Miss its only loss of the season. The Bulldogs will be looking to rewrite the script from last season, when they were eliminated in the Sugar Bowl by Notre Dame.\n\nHere’s more on the highly anticipated SEC rematch between Ole Miss and Georgia.\n\nSN AWARDS: 2025 All-America team | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff first round predictions\n\nOle Miss will face No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as one of, if not the, best programs in college football over the past five seasons. The Bulldogs won back-to-back championships in 2021 and 2022, securing the program's first national titles since 1980. This sustained period of dominance has seen them compile an FBS-best record of 64-6 since the start of the 2021 season, making them a perennial force in the playoff conversation.\n\nIn addition to the national titles, the Bulldogs have collected three of the last four SEC Championships, winning in 2022, 2024, and 2025, most recently a dominating 28-7 victory over No. 9 Alabama. The Crimson Tide were the one team that beat the Bulldogs this season, defeating them in September. But, Georgia was dominant in all three phases en route to another conference title in Atlanta.\n\nThis year's Georgia team is as talented as any in the country. On offense, Gunner Stockton is surrounded by talented skill position players, whether Zachariah Branch, Dillon Bell, Nate Frazier, Chauncey Bowens, Oscar Delp and more. On defense, the Bulldogs did not look like a typical Kirby Smart defense — especially when rushing the passer — early in the season, but have now gone four games allowing 10 or less points. There is an argument that though Georgia is No. 3, the best team in America lies in Athens.\n\nMORE: Georgia 2025 College Football Playoff tickets guide\n\nGeorgia and Ole Miss already squared off this year, with the Bulldogs winning 43-35 in Athens. Georgia, who is known for its dominance in the final frame, rattled off 17 fourth quarter points to give the Rebels their first and only loss.\n\nAn unparalleled run of success — two national championships, three SEC titles in four years, and nearly three calendar years without a regular-season loss — firmly establishes Georgia as the premier program in the modern era, setting the standard for every other team entering the newly expanded College Football Playoff.\n\nWith a head coach only in his second game in charge, the Rebels will face off against a program that everyone strives to be on New Years day. The No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs, the closest thing college football has to a dynasty, are awaiting their Lane Kiffin-less opponent in the Sugar Bowl Quarterfinal.\n\nRanking every Heisman winner from 200 to now\n\nFull list of college football's 2025 award winners\n\nTracking QB moves in the college football transfer portal",

By which, I mean, he's a king among journeymen.\n\nHis action in service of an injured Marcus Mariota in Week 16 marked his first pass as a member of the Washington football team since 2018, but no one knows him as simply a Commanders backup. His career has spanned 18 seasons, nine NFL starts and four professional football leagues. He's spent time with 14 different NFL franchises -- a number that puts him above all other journeymen and makes him an immaculate grid cheat code.

    "description": "Connor Ingram faces Vegas Sunday, and the Oilers' lack of attention to detail and defensive lapses against the Wild offer little confidence for his starting debut.",
    "fullText": "Calvin Pickard played well against the Minnesota Wild, but gave up four goals. That's not a positive sign for Connor Ingram, who will get the start on Sunday as the Edmonton Oilers head home to take on the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nThe Oilers had their chances offensively, but will have to play much better defensively to give Ingram some confidence as he tries to prove he's still got game left in the NHL. Because his AHL numbers have not been good, he'll need all the help he can get.\n\nEdmonton's attention to detail on Saturday isn't going to cut it with a huge question mark between the pipes. In November (see video above), I discussed the likelihood that the Oilers would give Ingram a look and whether there was a clear path to the NHL for him. I was partially right, but my timing was off.\n\nAt that time, Edmonton was still figuring out the situation with Stuart Skinner and Pickard. I assumed the Oilers would make an external change before going to Ingram. They did. Unfortunately, no one expected the change they made to be out of the lineup with an injury in his third start.\n\nNow, Ingram is the guy, ready or not. The Oilers have no choice but to find out.\n\nOilers Provide Several Injury Updates: Pickard Starts vs. Wild\n\nOilers Beat Bruins, But Potentially Lose Jarry In The Process\n\nDespite a .889 save percentage, Pickard wasn’t the problem Saturday afternoon. If anything, he was the reason the game stayed competitive as long as it did. The real issues sat higher up the food chain — in how the Oilers managed the game, handled pressure, and responded when a dagger goal at the end of the first period changed the energy level.\n\nThe Oilers weren’t outplayed for long stretches. In fact, there were plenty of opportunities in the third period to even the game. After clawing back in the first, they pushed, created chances, and tried again late in the game. It wasn't enough, as Filip Gustavsson was great for the Wild, and when the opportunity arose, Minnesota capitalized on Edmonton's mistakes.\n\nUnfortunately, the Oilers can't afford to make those mistakes when Ingram takes the net on Sunday.\n\nReport: Oilers Had Interest In Sabres Goalie Before Jarry Trade The Oilers reportedly had another goalie on their radar before they acquired Tristan Jarry from the Penguins.\n\nHe'll be up against Carter Hart -- Vegas' backup -- so both netminders have a lot to prove. It will be a storyline of two goalies, many of whom will wonder how much is left in the tank. To make life easier for Ingram, the Oilers need to help him get settled. An early lead and nearly mistake-free hockey will be key -- almost the opposite storyline from Saturday's matinee game.\n\nThis game came down to the smaller details.\n\nLeon Draisaitl got frustrated after a soft cross-checking call. On the ensuing two penalties, the Wild's Matt Boldy made one of those minors count. Later in the game, Evan Bouchard stuttered when he thought a penalty should have been called and an offside was missed. Finally, when Edmonton thought they were close on the game-tying goal in a scrum in front of Gustavsson, the Wild turned, went the other way, and scored.\n\nMistakes happened, and Minnesota struck when they did. The Oilers' awareness slipped at exactly the wrong time.\n\nThe late breakdowns will be a problem if Ingram isn't up to snuff. And, there's absolutely no way to know if he will be until he takes the goal and faces a few shots.\n\nThat’s where the bigger questions start to form. How confident can the Oilers possibly be in a goalie who has bad numbers in the minors and hasn't shown anything of note since the 2023-24 season?\n\nThere is no update on Tristan Jarry's status. A long-term injury leaves Edmonton in a very tricky situation -- one where they'll need to decide whether making a play for someone like Alex Lyon is the right move and whether they can pull it off, with the Buffalo Sabres well aware they have all the leverage.\n\nThe road trip was still productive, that's the good news. Despite the setbacks, the Oilers aren’t broken. But games like this linger because there are too many unanswered questions, Ingram being the biggest of them.\n\nThe Oilers will need to play a more mature game against the Golden Knights. It should be \n\nFrom there, the Oilers can only hope the news on Jarry isn't terrible.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "fullText": "Jaden McDaniels is impressed by Anthony Edwards' superstar moments against the Thunder originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA community had its eyes on the blockbuster game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. It was a rematch from the 2025 Western Conference Finals, and it felt like a true postseason matchup.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander once again stood out for the defending champions, but it was Anthony Edwards who took home the victory and everyone's attention. Edwards came up with plenty of big moments, especially during crunch time.\n\nAs two players who entered the league at the same time in 2020, Edwards and Jaden McDaniels are extremely close. They have been working together for a while, so they are not surprised when one of them plays well.\n\nIn fact, they are the biggest fans of each other's game, as both Edwards and McDaniels go out of their way to praise the other. Edwards has always been a firm believer that McDaniels is much more than just a lockdown defender, and McDaniels always knows that Edwards is a superstar-level player.\n\nMore: Timberwolves' Chris Finch nearly lost his mind after ejection\n\nA day after the big win against the Thunder, McDaniels was interviewed after practice. He made sure to address what Edwards did in the last 90 seconds of the win against the Thunder. That involved big defensive plays and a huge shot to finish with 26 points and 12 rebounds.\n\n\"I’m super impressed. I know he’s willing and wants the big moments and the big shots. It’s not our first time we’ve seen him make a shot like that and then defense, it’s the same stuff, I see him fly to the rim chasedown block vs Indiana like when he jumped over my head, then he did the same thing last night,\" McDaniels said to Zone Coverage's Andrew Dukowitz after practice.\n\nThe Timberwolves are having a decent season, but they are capable of doing much more. They were in the past two Western Conference Finals, so they want to exceed that and succeed.\n\nWith this win over the Thunder, it could be the confidence booster they have needed. Considering head coach Chris Finch got himself ejected against the Thunder, it just shows that this team is passionate about succeeding in a conference dominated by OKC.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Washington Commanders have an injury concern with quarterback Marcus Mariota in the Week 16 game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nMariota got banged-up in the third quarter. He stayed down on one knee after a play and was clearly shaken-up.\n\nIf Mariota can't return, veteran quarterback Josh Johnson will take the reins of the offense. Jayden Daniels is not available after being shut down for the season. The Commanders do not have a third quarterback available after Mariota and Johnson.\n\nFollow our tracker below for the latest updates on Mariota's status for the rest of the game against Philly.\n\nUPDATE: The Commanders are back on offense and Johnson is still in the game, so it looks like Mariota isn't returning. The team has not confirmed that, though.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota is now out of the locker room and back on the sideline, but he still has his right hand wrapped and hasn't grabbed his helmet. Not a good sign for his chances of returning.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota was evaluated for a concussion, but was cleared. However, the Commanders also revealed he is dealing with a right hand injury and is now questionable to return.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota is now heading to the locker room, according to Nicki Jhabvala of The Athletic. That is a bad sign for his chances of returning to the game.\n\nESPN's John Keim adds that Mariota had his throwing hand wrapped in a towel, so that appears to be his injury.\n\nStill no update from the team, though.\n\nMariota is headed to the medical tent to get checked out. It remains unclear exactly what he's dealing with.\n\nWe'll update this page once more information is available.\n\nNFL insider reveals Commanders' decision on Dan Quinn's future\n\nSaints rumor from Ian Rapoport gives definite answer on Kellen Moore's future\n\nAdam Schefter pinpoints head coaching job that will be \"highly attractive\"\n\nSeahawks accomplish feat never done in franchise history vs. Rams",

    "fullText": "Cristian Romero would not have been sent off in Tottenham's 2-1 Premier League loss to Liverpool if referee John Brooks \"did his job\" properly, says Spurs manager Thomas Frank.\n\nTottenham were reduced to 10 men in the first half after a VAR intervention when Xavi Simons was dismissed for a foul on Virgil van Dijk.\n\nHowever, the hosts fought back and reduced the deficit late on through substitute Richarlison.\n\nDespite being a man down, Tottenham were well on top in stoppage time and chasing an equaliser when their captain Romero received a second yellow card for a petulant kick out at Ibrahima Konate.\n\nRomero's first booking came for dissent in the aftermath of Liverpool's second goal, with the Argentine feeling Hugo Ekitike had pushed him in the back as he headed in.\n\n\"There is a massive mistake by John [Brooks] on the pitch. Two hands on the back by Ekitike,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I don't understand how he didn't see it. OK. Luckily we have VAR so they will bail you out when you need it, which they didn't. That was the second mistake.\n\n\"I think if you go back to that [second Liverpool goal] and the referee did his job, then I think it would not have been a first yellow [for Romero]. Is that fair to say?\n\n\"I have a player that is extremely passionate, and if you have a passionate player then you need to go to the line sometimes.\"\n\nIn a post on X, the Premier League match centre, said: \"The referee's call of goal for Liverpool was checked and confirmed by VAR - with it deemed there was normal contact for an aerial challenge between Ekitike and Romero.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given agreed on Match of the Day: \"I think John Brooks has got it right.\"\n\nSpurs can take a number of positives from fighting back with a numerical disadvantage against last term's champions, however the result leaves Frank's side 13th in the table.\n\nTottenham's 11 home league defeats in 2025 are also their most in a calendar year - and the fact five of those have come under the Dane, who took over from Ange Postecoglou in the summer, will place further scrutiny over his reign.\n\nLiverpool hold on for chaotic win at nine-man Spurs\n\nHowever, there are also likely to be question marks over Romero's suitability as the club's captain.\n\nThe Argentine, who was appointed as Tottenham skipper by Frank in the summer after the departure of Son Heung-min to Los Angeles FC, has a chequered disciplinary record.\n\nIn 114 Premier League appearances the former Atalanta defender has collected 34 yellow cards and three red cards.\n\nTottenham, alongside Bournemouth, have the most yellow cards in the top flight this season with 42 - and 21% of those (nine) can be attributed to Romero.\n\nHe was also one of the players to be given their marching orders when Spurs were last reduced to nine players in a league match, against Chelsea in 2023.\n\nAnd the context of his second yellow card against the Reds left former Tottenham and Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp bewildered.\n\n\"I think Hugo Ekitike's goal is a foul. I can't believe it's not given, A consequence of that is Cristian Romero runs after the referee and gets himself a yellow card which has an impact at the end of the game,\" Redknapp said on Sky Sports.\n\n\"What Romero did is what Romero does. To get involved right in front of the referee and kick out at someone right in front of the referee. If my four-year-old did that I would say 'what are you doing?'\n\n\"Konate leaves a bit on Romero first which is actually quite cute because he knows he is not going to get caught. But he [Romero] can't do that. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nAnd former Tottenham goalkeeper Joe Hart called some of Spurs' behaviour in the defeat \"wild\".\n\n\"They put up a really good fight but there was so much ill discipline,\" he told Match of the Day. \"You can't have that, you make it difficult for yourself.\n\n\"Xavi Simons has not gone out of his way to nail his fellow countryman but it is something so dangerous to do, absolutely a red card.\n\n\"They are fighting and scrapping for their lives, but from the moment Romero got that yellow card I felt another would come.\n\n\"Konate has just baited him and it is right in front of John Brooks - he has to give him a second yellow card.\n\n\"They just totally lost control. Richarlison after the game still not giving up, it all looked a bit wild out there.\"\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Simons apologised for his earlier attempted tackle on his Netherlands captain Van Dijk.\n\nHe wrote: \"Mistakes happen. Virg is my captain, I would never intentionally hurt him or anyone. To my Spurs team-mates, my manager and the fans, I take responsibility, I'm really sorry.\"\n\nWhile Frank conceded he had seen similar challenges to the one made by the attacking midfielder receive the same punishment, he suggested it was not worthy of a sending off.\n\n\"I don't like this [Simons' challenge] as a red card. I think the game is probably too big to say gone, but for me it's not reckless and it's not exceptional force,\" Frank added.\n\n\"He is chasing Van Dijk. He is trying to put pressure and then he changes direction. Unfortunately his foot is on Achilles.\n\n\"You can say 'ah, you need to be smarter, don't do it and all that' - but are we not allowed to have physical contact any more?\n\n\"The next thing on that is if he gets three games, which I don't understand, how can he get three games for something which is not reckless? That is absolutely wrong and we probably can't appeal it.\"\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "FC Bayern wants Dayot Upamecano to ink a new deal.",
    "fullText": "In recent days, the reports on the likelihood of Dayot Upamecano signing a contract extension have indicated that two major roadblocks (a signing bonus and a release clause) have become prevalent in the contract talks between the player’s camp and the club.\n\nBayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen re-emphasized that the club wants to bring back Upamecano and also that the environment will provide stability around the squad.\n\n“It’s common knowledge that we want to extend Upamecano’s contract. And I also believe we have nothing to be ashamed of regarding what we’ve offered him. It [the offer] reflects the outstanding performances Upa has delivered this season. Other factors often play a role in such a decision, not just the financial aspect. It shouldn’t be about every last euro,” Dreesen told Abendzeitung’s Maximilian Koch (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “The fact that the coach and coaching staff have extended their contracts is just as important. It’s also about whether the family feels comfortable, whether he has a good standing within the team and with the coach. Whether he’s playing for an ambitious club that actually wins things. Whether we’re playing attractive football. And I think those are good reasons for him to stay at FC Bayern.”\n\nHowever, when asked if he was confident that Upamecano would ultimately ink an extension, Dreesen did not want to express anything like that. Instead, he put the onus on Max Eberl and Christoph Freund to express their opinion on the matter.\n\n“That’s a question that mainly concerns Max Eberl and Christoph Freund. They are in good talks with Upa. I’d like to leave it at that assessment for now,” Dreesen stated.\n\nIn less than two weeks, Upamecano can formally talk to other clubs and at that point, we will all find out just how serious Upamecano is about his rumored requests for a signing bonus and a short-term release clause.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have been trying to solve their midfield issues for a while now.\n\nCasemiro’s resurgence has been praised, but at 33, he no longer has the legs to compete physically in the Premier League.\n\nThat can be seen from the fact that he has completed 90 minutes only three times this season, despite the Red Devils playing only once a week.\n\nSurprisingly, Kobbie Mainoo is not seen as a deep-lying playmaker, while Manuel Ugarte has earned the ire of his boss due to his lacklustre displays.\n\nRuben Amorim had identified Carlos Baleba of Brighton and Hove Albion as the perfect fit, but a summer deal proved beyond INEOS’ reach due to Brighton’s valuation.\n\nThe 21-year-old’s form subsequently fell off a cliff, with plenty of reports suggesting United had moved on to the likes of Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton.\n\nHe has 0 goals and assists this term, while at the same stage of last season, the Cameroon international had notched three goals and two assists.\n\nNot to mention he played the full 90 minutes a lot more times than the two games he has managed in the current campaign.\n\nBut Amorim remains convinced that the Cameroonian can be the heartbeat of his side, and it was suggested that the 20-time English league champions would revisit their interest come next summer.\n\nHowever, The Times have claimed that the Seagulls will continue to resist any attempts to sign their midfield dynamo.\n\nIn fact, Fabian Hürzeler’s side will not sanction a sale until 2027, which means the three-time Champions League winners will have to look elsewhere for now.\n\n“While United retain interest in Carlos Baleba, it is believed Brighton & Hove Albion’s plan is not to sell the 21-year-old until 2027.”\n\nA whole host of clubs are chasing Anderson, while Wharton will only move to a club which can offer him Champions League football.\n\nWhether INEOS persevere and still go after Carlos Baleba or whether they pivot and opt to sign someone else, only time will tell.\n\nFeature image Mike Hewitt via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The Denver Nuggets tipped off another game in Ball Arena on Saturday afternoon, seeking their seventh straight victory and third over the Houston Rockets this season.\n\nThe Nuggets found themselves particularly shorthanded, still without Aaron Gordon, Christian Braun, and Peyton Watson. Tim Hardaway Jr. started in Watson’s stead.\n\nThe Nuggets played some of their best defense of the season to open the game, but their offense never got off the runway, and the Rockets pulled away to snap Denver’s streak.\n\nThe Nuggets were down three key defenders as they took on the third-best offense in the NBA. And yet, they played some of their best defense of the season in the first quarter. The Nuggets forced six turnovers, an area in which they typically struggle, and scored nine points directly off those turnovers. They held Durant to 1-of-3 shooting in his first 10 minutes, and the Rockets to just 26 in the quarter.\n\nThe Nuggets failed to capitalize on their strong start in the first. In a rare occurrence, the offense sputtered in the second, and Denver couldn’t get anything going in the half-court. The Nuggets, owners of the highest offensive rating in the league and on pace to set the record, scored just 16 points in the quarter.\n\nHouston held the Nuggets to just 21 points in the third as well, making it by far the worst consecutive quarters of offense they’ve played this season.\n\nEveryone struggled from the field. Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray, Cam Johnson, and Tim Hardaway Jr. all shot below 50% in the loss.\n\nThe Nuggets have barely missed a beat since losing key players to injury, and Murray is a big reason why. But they didn’t look like they had two stars on the floor against Houston. Murray shot 4-of-13, finishing with just 16 points.\n\nJokić led the Nuggets in scoring, but he played an underwhelming game by his otherworldly standards. He never really dictated the action, and he played most of the game in foul trouble.\n\nWhile Denver’s offense failed to launch, the Rockets couldn’t miss. They shot 19-of-35 from deep, with three different players making at least five triples. Kevin Durant, Reed Sheppard, and Jabari Smith Jr. shot the lights out in Ball Arena. Even Josh Okogie shot 3-of-5.\n\nDurant led all scorers with 31. Sheppard scored all but one of Houston’s bench points with 28.",

    "fullText": "Best NFL players ever on the worst teams: Myles Garrett, Calvin Johnson and the 16 most wasted talents in history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCleveland edge rusher Myles Garrett is on the edge of making NFL history.\n\nGarrett – who has 21.5 sacks – can tie the NFL single-season sack record held by former Giants star Michael Strahan and Steelers edge rusher T.J Watt with his next sack. Garrett, of course, is playing for the Browns – who have been eliminated from the AFC playoff race.\n\nThat's going to beg the question: Is Garrett the best player on the worst team in NFL history? We're not just talking about this year. We're talking for the entirety of their career.\n\nSporting News identified 16 NFL stars – including eight Pro Football Hall of Fame players – who fit that description. We ranked those players based on four categories, including worst team winning percentage, playoff appearances (fewest scored higher), Pro Bowl selections (highest to lowest) and NFL MVP or AP Defensive Player of the Year Awards. In the event of a tie, the player whose teams had a lower winning percentage wen\n\nThis balances the great player vs. how good, or in this case bad, their team was.\n\nGarrett is in the top 10 along with another active edge rusher in the NFL. Who else made the list? A look at the 16 best NFL players on the worst teams.\n\nMORE:Tracking Myles Garrett's NFL single-season sacks record chase\n\nTeams: Saints (1999-2001), Dolphins (2002-03, 2005, 2007-10), Ravens (2011)\n\nWilliams – who rushed for 10,009 yards – had a rough start in New Orleans. He played for seven different head coaches – ranging from Mike Ditka to Nick Saban – retired for a year and was suspended for another. Williams played on a 3-13 team in New Orleans and a 1-15 team in Miami.\n\nTeams: Buccaneers (1987-92), Browns (1993-95), Ravens (1996-97), Jets (1998-2003, 2005), Cowboys (2004), Patriots (2006), Panthers (2007)\n\nTeam playoff record: 4–3 (2-3 as a starter)\n\nThe Buccaneers were 28-67 in six seasons after selecting Testaverde with the No. 1 pick in the 1987 NFL Draft. Testaverde was 23-25 in three seasons with Bill Belichick in Cleveland. He spent two seasons in Baltimore before the best stretch of his career with the Jets and made a start in the 1998 AFC championship game against Denver. Testaverde reunited with Bill Parcells in Dallas and Belichick in New England late in his career. He finished with a 90-123-1 record as a starter with 46,233 yards, which ranks 18th on the all-time list.\n\nTeams: Bengals (1996-2007), Ravens (2008)\n\nAnderson – a four-time Pro Bowl selection – played for four different coaches during the late 1990s and early 2000s \"Bungles\" era, and he played on just one winning team in 12 seasons with the franchise. Anderson played in one playoff game – a heart-breaking 31-17 loss to the Steelers in the AFC Wild Card round. Anderson did reach the AFC championship game with rival Balti\n\nTeams: Colts (1983-89), Falcons (1990-93), Vikings (1994-95)\n\nHinton – a seven-time Pro Bowl selection – was the player the Colts got in the John Elway trade. Hinton was a mainstay at tackle, but the Colts had four straight losing seasons after his arrival. Hinton played in four playoff games in his career, which also had stints with the Falcons and Vikings. He probably deserves more Pro Football Hall of Fame consideration.\n\nSanders – who ranks fourth all time in NFL history with 15,269 yards – played on decent teams. Detroit had a winning record in five of his 10 seasons and made the NFC championship game in 1991. Sanders abruptly retired in 1998 after the Lions finished 5-11 in 1998. Sanders' highlight reel has been passed down a few generations – but he never played in a Super Bowl.\n\nTeams: Rams (2004-12), Falcons (2013-14), Patriots (2015)\n\nJackson played on some miserable teams in St. Louis. The Rams averaged three wins per season from 2007-11 – a stretch in which Jackson had five straight 1,000-yard seasons. He finished his career with 11,438 rushing yards, and one of his two career playoff victories was in an abbreviated final season with the Patriots in 2015.\n\nSayers had a brief-but-brilliant career with the Bears, which was cut short by injuries. Sayers played for George Halas for four seasons – a stretch where Chicago compiled a 28-25-3 record. He led the NFL in rushing with 236 carries for 1,032 yards and eight TDs in 1969, a season in which the Bears finished 1-13.\n\nTeams: Saints (1993-2001); Chiefs (2002-05)\n\nRoaf was a dominant tackle in the NFL for the Saints – and he played for three head coaches in Jim Mora, Mike Ditka and Jim Haslett. New Orleans won one playoff game – a 34-24 victory against St. Louis in the NFC Wild Card round – on Dec. 30, 2000. He played four seasons with Kansas City – including two winning teams – to end his career.\n\nTeams: Jaguars (2006-13), Raiders (2014)\n\nJones-Drew helped Jacksonville reach the AFC divisional playoffs in his second season, but it went downhill from there despite a successful career in which he finished with 8,167 rushing yards in nine seasons. MJD played on teams that won an average of three games in his final three seasons between Jacksonville and Oakland.\n\nStephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nCrosby – who has 69.5 career sacks – has been with the franchise since the move from Oakland to Las Vegas. He has endured four straight losing seasons with the Raiders and has played for three coaches in each of the last three seasons. Yet Crosby remains on a trajectory that would get him to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Browns went 0-16 in Garrett's first season, so it's technically been uphill from there. Garrett has played for the same coach for six seasons in Kevin Stefanski, and the Browns did beat the Steelers 48-37 in the AFC Wild Card round on Jan. 10, 2021. It hasn't been all bad for the former No. 1 pick.\n\nJohnson never played on a team that won a playoff game. Detroit finished 0-16 in his second season, but \"Megatron\" continued to produce at a ridiculous level. The six-time Pro Bowl selection had 122 catches for a single-season record 1,964 receiving yards in 2012. Detroit had two winning seasons in nine years with Johnson on the field.\n\nKennedy – an eight-time Pro Bowl selection – never played on a team that won 10 games or \n\nYou can't think about the Tampa Bay creamsicle jerseys without Selmon, the six-time Pro Bowl selection who dominated at defensive tackle for the Bucs despite some woeful teams. Tampa Bay went 0-14 in Selmon's rookie season, and they lost 10 or more games six times in his nine seasons.\n\nButkus – arguably the most-feared defensive player of his era – was on the same teams as Gale Sayers, but the linebacker played two more seasons. Butkus made the Pro Bowl eight times in eight seasons before his final year, in which he played just nine games. He also finished in the top five in the NFL MVP voting twice despite playing for teams that finished with records of 8-8 and 7-9, respectively.\n\nThomas is the easiest choice here. He was a 10-time Pro Bowl selection in Cleveland despite a cast of revolving door of quarterbacks and coaches through one of the most-unstable periods for any franchise in NFL history. Cleveland went 10-6 in Thomas' first season. The Browns never won more than five games over the next 10 years, and Thomas' final season was the 0-16 year in 2017. Despite that, Thomas remains one of the most-beloved athletes in Cleveland sports history.",

    "title": "A.J. Preller had a busy week",
    "description": "Padres Notes No. 6",
    "fullText": "The San Diego Padres President of Baseball Operations and General Manager A.J. Preller stated on the last day of MLB’s Winter Meetings that he wanted to get clarification of the starting rotation “sooner rather than later.” That was Dec. 10. During the press conference on Friday, Dec. 19, announcing the signing of returning right-handed starter Michael King to a three-year deal, King said the discussions with Preller got serious “about 10 days ago.” That was when Preller asked manager Craig Stammen and pitching coach Ruben Niebla to text King, asking about his willingness to come back to the Padres.\n\nWhile Preller was in Orlando discussing the trade market and the Padres’ need for starting pitching, he and the rest of the staff were working behind the scenes to bring King back into the fold. But that wasn’t the only player Preller was working to sign in the 10 days since the end of the winter meetings.\n\nAlthough not an official deal yet, Preller has apparently landed Korean infielder Sung-Mun Song to a three-year deal for a reported $13 million. Considered a top international free agent from Korea, Song has primarily been a third baseman but has also played second and first base for the Kiwoom Heroes. Although some evaluators consider him as a utility player with offensive upside, the transition to the MLB from the KBO can be a struggle for some hitters due to the velocity and movement MLB pitchers employ against hitters. If Song can make that transition, his upside is significant, and he could become a candidate for the first base job.\n\nThe end of his window for a commitment to an MLB team is Dec. 21. The Padres will need to officially commit by then or he returns back to the Heroes. If the deal becomes official, the organization will owe his Korean team a posting fee of 20 percent of his contract amount up to $25 million.\n\nAn under-the-radar signing occurred this past week when Preller signed RHP Triston McKenzie to a minor league contract. McKenzie is also receiving an invite to Spring Training with his deal. Coming from a long stint in the Guardians organization, where he worked with former Guardians and current Padres pitching coach Ruben Niebla, McKenzie has a spotted history but significant upside.\n\nHe posted a 2.92 ERA over 30 starts in 2022 for the Guardians but then developed elbow and shoulder injuries and hasn’t been the same player since. He had a 11.12 ERA in four big-league appearances last season and wasn’t any better in the Dominican Winter League with 11.2 innings pitched and a 5.40 ERA. A reunion with Niebla could be exactly what the doctor ordered, and the Padres are taking a low-risk and high-reward gamble.\n\n“Those are always intriguing players – somebody that’s coming back from injuries, has something to prove,” said general manager A.J. Preller, speaking at Friday’s press conference to announce the signing of King. “In a different organization, maybe we can unlock something there. But he’s always been a super talented guy.”\n\nAt 6-5 and 164 pounds, the 28-year-old McKenzie provides potential back end of the rotation upside or rotation depth. If he and the Padres pitching coaches can straighten out his issues, he could be the kind of project that the organization has excelled at in the past.\n\nThe Padres made Craig Stammen’s coaching staff official and former bench coach Brian Esposito will be reassigned within the organization but will not be a part of the major league staff. They also announced further additions besides what had already been reported and these include former Triple-A hitting coach Raul Padron as the hitting instructor to round out a four-person hitting staff. They also have designated Vinny Lopez as outfield and base running instructor, which is also part of first base coach Dave Macias’ job.\n\nDespite some apparent repetition of job titles and roles, Stammen’s staff appears to be a team approach to instruction and managing. This reflects his own statements after his hiring. He acknowledged that he will employ more experienced personnel around him to make sure all the needs of the team are covered.\n\nThe Padres re-signed RHP Omar Cruz to a minor league contract. The 26-year-old had been part of the major league roster last season but was waived at the end of the year. The signing allows him to remain with the organization and could involve a Spring Training invite as well as providing needed pitching depth.\n\nRHP Justin Yeager was signed to a minor league deal. Yeager is a reliever formerly with the Brewers organization and is 27 years old. He played at the end of 2025 at the Triple-AAA level.\n\nRHP Albieris Polanco was signed to a minor league deal. The 19-year-old is an international free agent from the Dominican Republic.\n\nCatcher Blake Hunt was re-signed by the Padres to a minor league contract. Hunt was drafted by the Padres in 2017 as a second rounder. He was part of the deal for Blake Snell and since 2021 has bounced around with multiple organizations, becoming a free agent in November of this year and signing with the Padres on Dec. 16.\n\nRHP Nathanael Jacinto signed a minor league deal on Dec. 12. The 20-year-old Dominican Republic native was an international free agent.\n\nPadres reliever and presumed closer, Mason Miller, was named to Team USA for the WBC tournament. He becomes the first Padre named to the USA team and follows Manny Machado, Fernando Tatis Jr. and Xander Bogaerts as Padres leaving the team during Spring Training to compete in the WBC. It will be his first opportunity to pitch for Team USA and he joins a loaded USA team.",

    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff is dominating the national landscape on Saturday, but Michigan State made some noise with a notable hire that has received some positive feedback.\n\nIt was reported on Saturday afternoon that Michigan State football is \"expected\" to hire Alabama co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Nick Sheridan. The news of the expected hiring came out mid-day on Saturday, with 247Sports' Matt Zenitz breaking the news.\n\nSheridan has been with Alabama head coach Kalen DeBoer for the last four seasons -- two of which at Washington and two with the Crimson Tide. Prior to that, he was the offensive coordinator at Indiana for two seasons.\n\nThe expected hire has drawn some positive and negative reviews on social media, but one popular college football account is raving about the move from new Michigan Stat head coach Pat Fitzgerald. Shortly after the news of the hire was reported, CFBTalkDaily posted a positive response to the news and stated \"Michigan State is (going to) be a problem.\"\n\nPat Fitzgerald gets who he wants \n\nMichigan State is gonna be a problem https://t.co/CszewElHUm\n\n— CFBTalkDaily (@CFBTalkDaily) December 20, 2025\n\nThis is obviously a positive backing of Sheridan coming to Michigan State, but is also propping up the other hires Fitzgerald has made thus far for his staff. This has been a common take for fans to this point, and it sounds like adding Sheridan to the mix will only further that opinion.\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nARLINGTON, TEXAS - A season ago, DeSoto didn’t even make it back to AT&T Stadium after winning state titles there the previous two seasons.\n\nThe Eagles were more than determined to make it back this time around, and now they are here with a chance to win their third state title in four seasons. To do so, DeSoto must get past Houston Sheldon King, which is making its state championship game debut, in Saturday night’s University Interscholastic League 6A Division II championship game.\n\nLIVE STREAM:Victory+ (Victory Plus) will stream for free all 12 UIL state championship games.\n\nDeSoto is in the title game for the fourth time in program history, and the Eagles have won all three times they’ve previously gotten this far. In addition to the back-to-back crowns in 2022-23, the Eagles also won in their state title game debut, 2016.\n\nLast season, DeSoto’s bid to win three straight titles was derailed by Longview in the regional finals. The Eagles then started this season 0-2 with losses to Creekside (Ga.) and North Crowley.\n\nBut they’ve rounded more into form from there, winning 12 of their next 13 contests, with the only defeat in that span to Duncanville, which played for the 6A Division I championship earlier on Saturday.\n\nDeSoto avenged last season’s playoff defeat to Longview by beating the Lobos in the area round, 60-28. The Eagles have scored at least 56 points in all five playoff wins, including last week, when they rallied in the second half to defeat previously undefeated Southlake Carroll, 57-44.\n\nSheldon King enters its first state championship game at 13-2. The Panthers’ lone two defeats came to Dickinson, which reached the 6A DI regional finals, and Galena Park North Shore, which played for the 6A DI title earlier on Saturday.\n\nIn the playoffs, King scored at least 50 points in its first three games. Two weeks ago, in the regional final round, the Panthers got past Humble Summer Creek, 24-21, before downing defending 6A DII state champion Austin Vandegrift, 58-41, in the semifinals last week.\n\nNow, in the final game of the 2025 Texas high school football season, King wants to conclude things with its first title while DeSoto attempts to continue a dynastic run.\n\nFollow The Sporting News correspondent Buck Ringgold (@Bucks_Ballpark) for all of the live updates and scoring from Arlington.\n\nScroll down for live score and game updates from kickoff to the postgame.

    "fullText": "Myles Garrett is determined to break sack record at home against Bills originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEven though the Cleveland Browns are having a great season by any means, one of the only bright spots they've had is the elite play from defensive end Myles Garrett.\n\nThe pass rusher has consistently been among the best, alongside guys like T.J. Watt and Micah Parsons, since entering the league in 2017; in fact, since then, Garrett has recorded 10 or more sacks in each season after his rookie season.\n\nHowever, this has by far been his best season, and he is on the cusp of breaking the single-season sacks record, which is currently shared by Watt and NFL Hall of Famer Michael Strahan, who both had 22.5 sacks.\n\nGarrett is likely to find himself solely at the top of the mountain, only needing 1.5 sacks to break the record with three games left to play, including Sunday against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nLast week, the Browns suffered a lopsided loss to the Chicago Bears, and Garrett got to Caleb Williams multiple times, but it wasn't enough to tie or break the record. The two even joked about it during post-game handshakes, with Williams telling the defensive end, \"I couldn't let you get it on me.\"\n\nHowever, Garrett sees the good in the situation, as he now has the opportunity to make history in front of the home crowd.\n\nWhen asked about the record on Friday, Garrett added, \"I want it here in front of the fans.\" He would later also declare that getting the win is still the top priority.\n\nThe Browns will also be at home against the Pittsburgh Steelers next week, meaning Garrett has two chances to deliver on that wish to the fans.\n\nMyles Garrett sacks tracker: Updated 2025 total for Browns star amid chase for NFL single-season record\n\nBrowns' Shedeur Sanders struggles in a way an NFL QB hasn't since John Beck in 2007\n\nShedeur Sanders stats today: Bears defense overwhelms Browns rookie with three interceptions, five sacks\n\nMyles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record in loss to Bears\n\nBrowns' Myles Garrett makes incredible Godzilla, King of Monsters self-comparison\n\nBrowns' Shedeur Sanders is under pressure more than any QB since 2009",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are currently fully focused on their upcoming Week 16 matchup with the Baltimore Ravens. However, their front office already likely has an eye on the offseason, where disgruntled San Francisco 49ers’ wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk could emerge as a potential target for the team.\n\nAiyuk has been floated as a trade target for New England over the past couple of years, but he hasn’t played for San Francisco at all this season due to a dispute with the team. As a result, reports indicate the two sides are likely to part ways this upcoming offseason.\n\nWhile there is quite a bit of drama surrounding Aiyuk, his play on the field when he’s been healthy makes him a guy worth considering for the Patriots. However, he recently shared a video of himself driving over 90 MPH past the Niners’ stadium, Levi’s Stadium, which is well over the speed limit in that area.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk posted a new YouTube video where in it, he is going over 90 MPH past Levi’s Stadium 🏟️ #FTTB | #49ers pic.twitter.com/g0Q4GXUmnU\n\n— 49ers & NFL News 24/7 (@49ersSportsTalk) December 20, 2025\n\nThere’s been a lot of mystery and mystique surrounding Aiyuk’s stunning fall from grace with the 49ers. Whatever the reason may be, though, he will likely be up for grabs, and if the Patriots want him, now may be the time to pounce.\n\nIn 2023, Aiyuk enjoyed a breakout campaign, as he caught 75 passes for 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns, earning him a spot on the All-Pro Second Team. After getting a four-year, $120 million contract, Aiyuk struggled in seven games last season (25 REC, 374 YDS) before suffering a torn ACL, which ended his season.\n\nSerious questions surround Aiyuk, and it remains to be seen how much interest he will draw over the offseason. If the price is right, though, he could be worth taking a flier on, as New England needs all the top-end wide receiver talent that it can get.\n\nShould Patriots Renew Brandon Aiyuk Pursuit Amid 49ers Release Rumors?",

    "fullText": "Washington State improved to 5-8 with its second consecutive win, defeating the Mercer Bears 84-78. Mercer, out of the Southern Conference, traveled to Pullman at 7–4 looking to snap a two-game skid.\n\nKenPom projected a 79-75 win for the Cougars, and the betting line sat at WSU -7.5.\n\nThe game got off to a shaky start as the Cougs surrendered a wide-open three to Mercer, and ND Oakafor picked up an early technical foul.\n\nThe teams traded buckets early, with the Cougs coming out hot and scoring 13 points in the first four minutes. However, the offense soon went stagnant, as turnover issues plagued Washington State once again. The Cougs managed just two points over the next six minutes.\n\nDefensive struggles resurfaced for WSU, allowing Mercer to score 25 points in the first ten minutes. Ace Glass helped keep the Cougars afloat, starting 5-of-8 from the floor.\n\nDefensive intensity picked up for Washington State, but the Bears reached the bonus with five minutes remaining in the half due to several chintzy off-ball fouls.\n\nThere was very little separation between the teams in the first half. Glass scored 14 points before the break, and the Cougs shot an impressive 59% from the field. Despite that efficiency, WSU led by just two, 41–39. Eight turnovers allowed Mercer to attempt eight more shots than Washington State.\n\nThe Cougs opened the second half strong, highlighted by a deep three from Glass that pushed the lead to five. Mercer responded immediately and tied the game.\n\nAdria Rodriguez delivered a strong defensive performance, recording a steal and a score and making his presence felt throughout the game. Adria seems to be playing far more confident than earlier in the season, coming up with 7 points as-well.\n\nThen the Cougars finally erupted. WSU hit eight straight field goals, including three triples from Ri Vavers, stretching the lead to 14.\n\nWashington State had opportunities to put the game away but failed to capitalize, missing multiple easy looks off turnovers. ND Oakafor also missed two free throws after a missed dunk. The lead never grew beyond fourteen.\n\nCoach David Riley later went to a lineup in which Thrastarson was the primary scoring threat, and the offense went ice cold.\n\nThe Cougs slowed down near the finish line as Mercer’s Baraka Okojie continued to knock down mid-range jumpers. The Bears extended the game with fouling and quick shots but never cut the deficit to fewer than five points.\n\nGlass finished with 24 points on 8-of-14 shooting. It was a balanced offensive effort for the Cougars, with four other players scoring in double figures. Eemeli Yalaho posted a strong performance with 14 points and eight rebounds, while Rihards Vavers came off the bench to hit four three-pointers. WSU shot 54% from the floor, and sunk 11 of their 23 three-point attempts.\n\nThis had the makings of a comfortable win for the Cougars, who entered the game ranked 154th in KenPom among a group of teams with winning records. However, the finish left much to be desired, as WSU effectively put on the brakes. The Cougs could have won by 20 or more, but instead escaped with a six-point victory.\n\nWashington State has played much better since returning from the Maui Invitational, holding opponents under 80 points in six straight games after allowing 80-plus in five of their first six contests. At 5-8, the Cougs have dropped four swing-games to Idaho, Arizona State, Bradley, and USC.\n\nUSC currently ranks 39th in KenPom, Arizona State sits at 64th, and Bradley at 119th, showing that Washington State has competed well against solid opponents recently.\n\nHopefully, David Riley can build on this two-game winning streak as conference play approaches. The Cougs will make a brief Pacific Northwest swing, facing the Portland Pilots in Portland on December 28 before traveling to Seattle to take on the Redhawks on December 30. Seattle U recently upset Washington and sits at 10-2, setting up a fun matchup for Coug fans at Climate Pledge Arena.\n\nWashington State’s next contest, at the University of Portland, will air on ESPN+ at 2:00 p.m. on December 28.",

    "fullText": "OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Trinidad Chambliss ran for two touchdowns and passed for another, and No. 6 Mississippi looked unfazed by the defection of coach Lane Kiffin, beating No. 17 Tulane 41-10 on Saturday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\n\nScoring runs of 20 yards by Kewan Lacy and 4 yards by Chambliss gave Ole Miss (12-1) a 14-0 lead before eight minutes had elapsed in the coaching debut of Pete Golding, who was promoted from defensive coordinator after Kiffin left for LSU on Nov. 30.\n\nNext up for Golding and Ole Miss: a CFP quarterfinal against No. 2 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1\n\nTulane (11-3) and quarterback Jake Retzlaff moved the ball effectively at times, but the Rebels — who beat the Green Wave 45-10 on Sept. 20 — remained comfortably ahead throughout. Cornerback Jaylon Braxton had an early interception, and the Rebels’ defense had multiple fumble recoveries and fourth-down stops.\n\nWhile Kiffin had asked to keep coaching Ole Miss through the playoff even while working for its Southeastern Conference rival, athletic director Keith Carter would not allow it. So the Rebels entered arguably the most significant game ever played at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium with a new coach — not to mention an unprecedented level of looming staff and roster uncertainty for a team contending for a national title.\n\nIn Mississippi’s famed Grove, artwork around tailgate tents depicted Kiffin in a negative light, including one showing him on a Christmas “naughty” list, with Golding in the “nice” column.\n\nWhen Golding walked onto the field during warm-ups, the crowd roared. Fans continued cheering as Eli Manning, a former Ole Miss QB and two-time Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants, greeted the new Rebels coach on the sideline.\n\nOn the opposite sideline was Tulane coach Jon Sumrall, who was permitted to keep coaching the Green Wave after being hired by Florida. His hopes of returning to Tulane’s home city of New Orleans to prepare for the Sugar Bowl were dashed, and he’ll be packing up for Gainesville, Florida, to join the Gators.\n\nChambliss, who briefly left the game late in the first half after a big hit during an 11-yard scramble, finished with 282 yards passing. Lacy rushed for 87 yards before heading to the locker room in the fourth quarter with an apparent left shoulder injury. De’Zhaun Stribling caught five passes for 79 yards, including a 13-yard TD.\n\nLSU transfer Logan Diggs added a 3-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.\n\nRetzlaff finished with 306 yards passing and a TD for Tulane, whose loss dropped non-power conference teams to 0-3 in CFP games (with James Madison playing at Oregon later Saturday night). Jamauri McClure gained 84 yards on 15 carries.\n\nTulane: The Green Wave could not afford a poor start on defense and got exactly that as the Rebels scored two TDs on their first seven offensive plays. As in the teams’ first meeting, Tulane moved the ball in spurts, finishing with 421 yards, but could sustain drives long enough to score.\n\nOle Miss: Kiffin’s absence didn’t inhibit the Rebels’ explosiveness on offense — at least not against a team from a non-power conference. The Rebels finished 497 yards of total offense, including four plays that went for 25 yards or more.",

    "fullText": "Ranking 3 Key Golden State Warriors Trade Targets originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are expected to get active in the NBA trade market once again.\n\nAfter making a handful of notable trades during the 2024-2025 season, the Warriors are keeping an eye on several targets just months before the deadline. According to the NBA insider Chris Haynes, the Warriors have three names on their radar as they look to boost the front court.\n\n\"They are looking for size and athleticism. You look at the Warriors, rebounding and blocking shots, they're in the bottom half of the league. And points in the paint, they are dead last. So they are looking for an athletic center,\" Haynes said on NBA on Prime on Friday night.\n\nWhat the Bucks and Warriors are looking for on the trade market for @NBAonPrime. pic.twitter.com/Pl2CcXo5AV\n\n— Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) December 20, 2025\n\nDallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford was the first name to come up, and he just might be at the top of the list. The 27-year-old big man is a former second-round pick out of Arkansas.\n\nGafford is playing for his third team since entering the NBA in 2019, having previous stints with the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards. Last season, he appeared in 57 games for the Mavs, averaging 12.3 points and 6.8 rebounds. This year, he’s producing 8.5 points per game, while coming down with 6.1 rebounds and blocking 1.5 shots in 17 games.\n\nThe Mavericks are currently paying $14.3 million to Gafford. He has a $54 million extension kicking in next season.\n\nWhile he only has two playoff runs on his resume, Gafford had a meaningful postseason run in 2024 with 22 appearances, maintaining his regular-season averages.\n\nNic Claxton of the Brooklyn Nets is another reported target for Golden State. Although the Nets invested nearly $100 million in Claxton last year, they remain in a rebuilding mode. Sitting 13th in the Eastern Conference with a 7-19 record, the Nets are expected to operate as sellers ahead of the deadline.\n\nSince 2019, Claxton has been a part of three playoff runs in Brooklyn. Between 2022 and 2023, the Nets faced two first-round sweeps, limiting Claxton's chances of improving his postseason value. Despite the lack of experience, Claxton is a logical candidate.\n\nLastly, the Portland Trail Blazers center, Robert Williams, is gaining attention from the Warriors’ front office, according to Haynes. The 28-year-old former first-round pick is in year three with the Portland Trail Blazers after spending several seasons with the Boston Celtics.\n\nWilliams was a defensive standout with the Celtics before leaving for Portland in 2023. Since his exit from the Celtics, Williams has struggled to stay healthy. He underwent multiple knee surgeries over the past couple of years, limiting his production with the Blazers.\n\nThis season, Williams has appeared in 17 games for the Blazers. With an average of 15 minutes of playing time off the bench, he has produced averages of 5.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks this year.\n\nThe idea of Williams on the Warriors might seem great, but his injury history is certainly a concern.\n\nWhile Williams, Gafford, and Claxton are three names to keep an eye on in December, several other options could pop up for the Warriors as the season plays out. It’s unclear who the Warriors will end up with, but the 13-15 squad from Golden State is expected to make some important roster changes before the market closes.",

    "fullText": "Move over, Magic Johnson. You’re no longer considered the best point guard to ever play the game of basketball. At least not in the eyes of Jaylen Brown.\n\nThe Boston Celtics star recently went live on Twitch with streamer DDG to discuss a bunch of different topics, and when the topic of Stephen Curry came up, Brown couldn’t help but admit that, in his view, Curry is the best point guard ever.\n\n“Curry gotta be (the) best PG all time,” Brown said.\n\nJaylen Brown: \"Curry gotta be the best [point guard of all-time].\"\n\nDDG: \"I got him over Michael Jordan.\"\n\nBrown: \"I don't know if I can ride with that. But I'm very high on Steph Curry.\"\n\n(via @DDG/ Twitch)pic.twitter.com/IPf7QjdfUK\n\n— ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) December 18, 2025\n\nInterestingly, Brown brought up Curry’s intangibles when discussing why he’s so special.\n\n“Steph is a leader,” Brown said. “(There’s) stuff that you don’t also see … Steph has leadership ability … some people just hoop. It’s not just basketball when you’re playing basketball. You gotta be a leader. You gotta be a good teammate. You gotta handle adversity well. That’s how you win championships. Steph does that well. He carries himself very well on and off the court.”\n\nWhile some NBA traditionalists might scoff at Jaylen’s notion of Curry being the GOAT point guard, Curry actually has a very solid case.\n\nAt age 37, Curry continues to play at a superstar level despite his size and average athleticism, recently dropping 48 points against the Portland Trail Blazers while breaking Michael Jordan’s record for most 40-point games after turning 30.\n\nSteph’s four championships with Golden State include two won without Kevin Durant (for people making superteam allegations), and Curry won back-to-back MVPs in his prime.\n\nPerhaps more than any of his trophies or accolades, Steph’s impact is revealed by how he’s completely changed the sport. Curry’s revolutionary three-point shooting literally transformed basketball, forcing defenses to adapt and inspiring a new wave of modern offensive philosophy.\n\nMagic dazzled with his passing, all-around dominance and five rings, but Curry’s scoring prowess and style, with over 3,900 career threes, is something the league has never seen before. Today’s pace-and-space game is a testament to Curry’s influence. You can’t go wrong with either player at the top of point guard mountain, but more people need to start acknowledging that Curry has as rightful a place up there as Magic.\n\nJayson Tatum Drops Truth Bomb On Celtics’ 2024 NBA Finals Victory",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox have already addressed the starting rotation with trades for Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo. However, they are reportedly interested in Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta.\n\nAccording to The Athletic on Dec. 10, the Red Sox are among the teams interested in Peralta. He is one year away from free agency and is playing on an $8 million club option next season. While he is affordable for the Brewers right now, the team may feel it’s time to trade him before they cannot afford him, just as they did with Corbin Burnes, Devin Williams and Josh Hader.\n\nIt was expected to take a haul to land Peralta before, but after Shane Baz was dealt for four top 30 prospects and a 2026 Competitive Balance Round A Draft pick, Peralta’s asking price could have gone up. Baz had three more years of control, playing into the massive return, but he is not near the level of pitcher Peralta.\n\nBaz has a 4.25 career ERA and had a 4.87 ERA in 31 starts. He is younger than Peralta, but Peralta is already a proven ace. He is a two-time All-Star and is coming off the best year of his career.\n\nPeralta had a 2.70 ERA in 33 starts and notched at least 200 strikeouts for the third consecutive season. With just one year of control left, it’s unlikely he will demand the same haul as Baz, but the Brewers can likely up their asking price after seeing what Baz was dealt for.\n\nBaz is expected to be a middle-rotation arm for the Baltimore Orioles. If that was able to net four great prospects, Peralta may be able to yield the Brewers at least two top 30 prospects. When the Brewers traded Corbin Burnes, they got DL Hall and Joey Ortiz, who was a top 100 prospect at the time.\n\nThe market is different every year, and Baz’s deal may have made it significantly harder to land Peralta. While he would certainly improve the Red Sox and be their No. 2 starter, the price to land him may not be worth it.\n\nJust one year after trading away four top 30 prospects to acquire Garrett Crochet, the Red Sox may not want to deplete the farm system again for one year of Peralta.\n\nRed Sox Sign Pitcher After Six Seasons With Dodgers",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Pirates have been quite busy over the past couple of days, as their front office is making good on their promise to improve the roster over the offseason. Prior to the recent flurry of moves, one of the Pirates’ bigger moves in free agency came earlier this month when they signed relief pitcher Gregory Soto to a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nA two-time All-Star, Soto is one of the premier left-handed relievers in the league. He didn’t have his best season in 2025 (1-5, 4.18 ERA, 1 SV, 70 K, 1.43 WHIP), but Soto can be used in just about any high-leverage situation, which makes him very valuable. Now, he’s joining an upstart Pirates team, and he’s looking forward to helping this group improve in 2026.\n\n“What I saw in the Pirates was a group of young guys with a lot of talent and with the desire to win, and that’s something that I’ve built throughout the years. I’ve been in the league for a few years now and I want to come here and contribute to that,” Soto said.\n\nSoto will immediately become a key piece of Pittsburgh’s bullpen, and he could even be a candidate to close games, as he has 56 saves over his seven-year career. Regardless of his role, his presence will help make the Pirates’ bullpen a much better group in 2026, and it will be worth keeping tabs on the team to see if they make any more big moves in the coming weeks.\n\nMore MLB: Pirates Finalize 2026 Coaching Staff With Five New Hires\n\nThe post Gregory Soto Explains Decision To Sign With Pirates In Free Agency appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nYou may have felt that this was the case for some time already in a matter of fact sense, but it became official on Saturday night when the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Washington Commanders. Thanks to losses over the last two weeks to the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings the Cowboys left themselves with only one path into the postseason and that was as the hypothetical winner of the NFC East. That will not come to pass as the Eagles have now won it.\n\nMuch is always made about how the NFC East has not featured a back-to-back champion since 2003 and 2004 when the Eagles did it themselves. They have put that all to an end by doing it once more and on the subject of streaks the Cowboys now have one going themselves as far as playoff absences are concerned.\n\nDallas missed the playoffs last year, they were eliminated around the same time as it happened on December 22nd, which means they have missed the postseason for two years in a row for the first time since 2019 and 2020. Then, like now, the Cowboys were in the final year of one head coach (Jason Garrett) and the first of another (Mike McCarthy). It is almost like that is not necessarily a recipe for success.\n\nThere is a lot of introspection that is necessary from the Cowboys these days and their current playoff drought is representative of that. We talk often about how this team hasn’t been the same since they were bounced from the 2023 Wild Card Round and obviously the evidence here speaks for that as well.\n\nWe now know conclusively that there are only 3 games left on the season for the Cowboys. We also know that their drought for Super Bowl and/or NFC Championship Game appearances (the drought that Stephen Jones didn’t understand to exist) will officially grow to 30 years. It is not an approximation or a rounding up.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' playoff chances looked incredibly slim heading into Week 16, as the team had less than a 1% chance to qualify for the postseason with a 6-7-1 record.\n\nBrian Schottenheimer's squad has lost two consecutive games since a massive Thanksgiving victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 13, falling to the Detroit Lions in Week 14 and the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15.\n\nDallas will square off against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday at AT&T Stadium, but that game isn't even going to matter anymore.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles took care of business and defeated the injury-riddled Washington Commanders on Saturday. With the Eagles securing the victory, they clinched their second consecutive NFC East title and officially eliminated the Cowboys from playoff contention.\n\nDallas was already out of wild-card talks after the loss to Minnesota last week, so it was win the division or bust heading into the final three weeks.\n\nAfter tallying three straight 12-5 seasons from 2021 to 2023, the Cowboys have missed the playoffs in back-to-back years. They will now look to finish the season on a high note, starting with Los Angeles and ending with the two road matchups versus the Commanders and the New York Giants.\n\nA lot of questions will need to be answered this offseason in Dallas, as the franchise has won just two playoff games since 2016, the beginning of the Dak Prescott era, and is still in danger of posting a third losing season in six years.\n\nJosh Jacobs, Christian Watson playing statuses revealed as Packers release inactives\n\nIs D'Andre Swift playing tonight?

All rationale and iteration over time right here, perfectly preserved with extra context that wasn’t even visible in chat. This is already a memory system. We just need to read it.\n\nEverything is there. Chronological. Structured. Greppable.\n\nripgrep (rg) is a line-oriented search tool. It’s fast enough that searching megabytes of session history feels instant. More importantly, it’s precise: regex patterns, file filtering, context lines, match limiting.\n\nThe key insight for JSONL: each event is one long line. Raw output is unreadable. But ripgrep can extract snippets:\n\nThis is the entire technique. Count, snippet, narrow, then full context only when you know what you want.\n\nWe built a Rust CLI called lookback with boolean query parsing (AND/OR operators) and snippet extraction. It works. It’s also unnecessary complexity.\n\nWhen we compared it against raw ripgrep for finding specific information in session history, ripgrep won. Fewer queries, clearer results. The structure of the raw JSON actually helped — seeing \"name\":\"Edit\" next to \"file_path\" immediately shows what happened.\n\nThe boolean query parser was clever. But rg 'pattern' | rg 'filter' does the same thing.\n\nSession files are append-only logs. New events add lines; nothing mutates. This means:\n\nhttps://github.com/backnotprop/rg_history\n\nA skill file teaches Claude Code how to search its own history:\n\nThe skill is ~100 lines of markdown. No database. No embedding service. No API keys.\n\nThe file system was the memory system all along.",

    "fullText": "“Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.” This timeless quote by Albert Einstein offers a simple yet profound lesson about life, resilience and growth. Though brief, the message continues to resonate with people navigating uncertainty, change and everyday challenges.\n\nWhat Is the Meaning of This Albert Einstein Quote?\nThrough this quote, Albert Einstein compares life to riding a bicycle. Balance, he suggests, does not come from standing still but from constant movement. In practical terms, this means progress, no matter how slow, is essential to maintaining stability in life.\n\nEinstein’s words highlight an important truth: stagnation often leads to discomfort, fear and imbalance, while movement brings clarity and confidence.\n\nWhy This Quote by Albert Einstein Still Matters Today\nIn today’s world, where people often feel stuck due to personal, professional or social pressures, this quote feels especially relevant. From career setbacks to emotional struggles, life rarely offers perfect conditions. Yet, Einstein reminds us that waiting for everything to be ideal is not the solution.\n\nWhether it is learning a new skill, starting over after failure, or simply taking small daily steps, forward movement is key to staying mentally and emotionally balanced.\n\nLife Lessons Hidden in Einstein’s Bicycle Metaphor\nThe bicycle metaphor is powerful because it is relatable. Anyone who has learned to ride a bicycle knows that stopping completely often leads to falling. Similarly, in life, fear of failure can hold people back.\n\nEinstein’s quote encourages persistence over perfection. It reassures us that progress does not need to be dramatic. Even slow, steady movement is enough to maintain balance and direction.\n\nHow This Quote Applies to Career, Health and Relationships\nIn careers, the quote suggests continuous learning and adaptability. In health, it highlights the importance of consistent habits rather than sudden transformations. In relationships, it reminds us that communication and effort are necessary to maintain balance.\n\nEinstein’s wisdom fits seamlessly into modern life, making the quote relevant across age groups and professions.\n\nWhy Albert Einstein’s Quotes Remain Universally Popular\nAlbert Einstein’s quotes endure because they are rooted in human experience, not just science. His ability to express complex ideas in simple language makes his thoughts accessible to everyone.\n\nThis quote, in particular, reflects Einstein’s belief in growth, curiosity and perseverance, values that remain essential in every era.\n\nQuote of the Day by Albert Einstein\n“Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving” is more than a motivational line. It is a gentle reminder to embrace motion, accept change and trust the process of life.\n\nIn moments of doubt or hesitation, Einstein’s words encourage us to take the next step, because balance comes from movement, not stillness.\n\n(You can now Read More News onalbert einstein quotequote of the day einsteinalbert einstein life quotesfamous einstein quotesinspirational quotes by einsteineinstein quote meaningmotivational quotes by albert einsteinwisdom quotes by einsteineinstein quotes on lifedaily inspirational quotes \n(You can now Read More News onalbert einstein quotequote of the day einsteinalbert einstein life quotesfamous einstein quotesinspirational quotes by einsteineinstein quote meaningmotivational quotes by albert einsteinwisdom quotes by einsteineinstein quotes on lifedaily inspirational quotes",

    "title": "Impeachment in the United States",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "In the United States, impeachment is the process by which a legislature may bring charges against an elected member of the executive branch or an appointed official for severe alleged misconduct, and may result in removal of the guilty from their position after the consequential trial. In addition to Congress at the federal level, impeachment may occur at the state level if the state or commonwealth has provisions for it under its constitution. Impeachment might also occur with tribal governments as well as at the local level of government. Separate procedures are in place for elected members of the legislature to remove a peer for a comparable level of misconduct.\n\nThe federal House of Representatives can impeach a party with a simple majority of the House members present or such other criteria as the House adopts in accordance with Article One, Section 2, Clause 5 of the United States Constitution. This triggers a federal impeachment trial in the United States Senate, which can vote by a two-thirds majority to convict an official, removing them from office. The Senate can also further, with just a simple-majority vote, vote to bar an individual convicted in a senate impeachment trial from holding future federal office.\n\nMost state legislatures can impeach state officials, including the governor, in accordance with their respective state constitution. A number of organized United States territories do as well. Additionally, impeachment is a practice of other government bodies, such as tribal governments.\n\nImpeachment proceedings are remedial rather than punitive in nature, and the remedy is limited to removal from office. Because the process is not punitive, a party may also be subject to criminal or civil trial, prosecution, and conviction under the law after removal from office. Also because the conviction is not a punishment, the president of the United States is constitutionally prevented from granting a pardon to impeached and convicted persons, that may have protected them from the consequences of a conviction in an impeachment trial.\n\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the United States Constitution provides:\n\nThe House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\n\nArticle I, Section 3, Clauses 6 and 7 provide:\n\nThe Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present.\nJudgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States; but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\n\nArticle II, Section 2 provides:\n\n[The President] ... shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\n\nArticle II, Section 4 provides:\n\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.[1]\n\nThe Constitution limits grounds of impeachment to \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\",[2] but does not itself define \"high crimes and misdemeanors\".\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the authority to impeach and remove \"The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States\" upon a determination that such officers have engaged in treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. The Constitution does not articulate who qualifies as a \"civil officer of the United States\".[3] Federal judges are subject to impeachment.[4] Within the executive branch, any presidentially appointed \"principal officer\", including a head of an agency such as a secretary, administrator, or commissioner, is a \"civil officer of the United States\" subject to impeachment.[5] At the opposite end of the spectrum, lesser functionaries, such as federal civil service employees, do not exercise \"significant authority\", and are not appointed by the president or an agency head. These employees do not appear to be subject to impeachment, though that may be a matter of allocation of House floor debate time by the Speaker, rather than a matter of law.\n\nThe Senate has concluded that members of Congress (representatives and senators) are not \"civil officers\" for purposes of impeachment.[6] As a practical matter, expulsion is effected by the simpler procedures of Article I, Section 5, which provides \"Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members ... Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member\" (see List of United States senators expelled or censured and List of United States representatives expelled, censured, or reprimanded). This allows each House to expel its own members without involving the other chamber. In 1797, the House of Representatives impeached Senator William Blount of Tennessee.[7]\n\nThe constitutional text is silent on whether an officer can be tried after the officer resigns or their term ends. However, when the issue has arisen, the House has been willing to impeach after resignation, and the Senate has been willing to try the official after resignation. In 1797, the Senate continued impeachment proceedings against William Blount even after he had been expelled from office, dismissing the proceedings only after determining that a Senator is not a \"civil officer of the United States\". In 1876, William W. Belknap was impeached by the House of Representatives hours after resigning as United States Secretary of War. The Senate held by a 37–29 vote that it had jurisdiction to try Belknap notwithstanding his resignation, but ultimately acquitted him after trial.[8] The permissibility of trying a former official was a major issue in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, which commenced twenty days after Trump's term in office expired, although Trump's impeachment itself occurred while he was president. By a 55–45 vote, the Senate rejected a motion asserting that the trial was unconstitutional.[9]\n\nThe Constitution does not limit the number of times an individual may be impeached. As of 2025, Donald Trump is the only federal officer to have been impeached more than once.\n\nAt the federal level, the impeachment process is typically a three-step procedure. The first phase is typically an impeachment inquiry, though this is not a required stage.[10] The two stages constitutionally required for removal are impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial by the United States Senate.\n\nImpeachment proceedings may be requested by a member of the House of Representatives, either by presenting a list of the charges under oath or by asking for referral to the appropriate committee. The impeachment process may be requested by non-members. For example, when the Judicial Conference of the United States suggests a federal judge be impeached, a charge of actions constituting grounds for impeachment may come from a special prosecutor, the president, or state or territorial legislature, grand jury, or by petition. An impeachment proceeding formally begins with a resolution adopted by the full House of Representatives.[10]\n\nAn impeachment resolution may first pass through a House committee before the full House votes on it.[10] The type of impeachment resolution determines the committee to which it is referred. A resolution impeaching a particular individual is typically referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. A resolution to authorize an investigation regarding impeachable conduct is referred to the House Committee on Rules, and then to the Judiciary Committee. The House Committee on the Judiciary, by majority vote, will determine whether grounds for impeachment exist (this vote is not law and is not required, US Constitution and US law).\n\nEither as part of the impeachment resolution or separately specific grounds and allegations of for impeachment will be outlined in one or more articles of impeachment.\n\nThe House debates the resolution and may at the conclusion consider the resolution as a whole or vote on each article of impeachment individually. A simple majority of those present and voting is required for each article for the resolution as a whole to pass. If the House votes to impeach, managers (typically referred to as \"House managers\", with a \"lead House manager\") are selected to present the case to the Senate. Recently, managers have been selected by resolution, while historically the House would occasionally elect the managers or pass a resolution allowing the appointment of managers at the discretion of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. These managers are roughly the equivalent of the prosecution or district attorney in a standard criminal trial. Also, the House will adopt a resolution in order to notify the Senate of its action. After receiving the notice, the Senate will adopt an order notifying the House that it is ready to receive the managers. The House managers then appear before the bar of the Senate and exhibit the articles of impeachment. After the reading of the charges, the managers return and make a verbal report to the House.[citation needed]\n\nSenate rules call for an impeachment trial to begin at 1 pm on the day after articles of impeachment are delivered to the Senate, except for Sundays. There is no timeframe requirement for when the managers must actually deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate. On the set date, senators are sworn in for the impeachment trial.[14]\n\nThe proceedings take the form of a trial, with the Senate having the right to call witnesses and each side having the right to perform cross-examinations.[15] The House members, who are given the collective title of managers during the trial, present the prosecution case, and the impeached official has the right to mount a defense with his or her own attorneys as well. Senators must also take an oath or affirmation that they will perform their duties honestly and with due diligence. After hearing the charges, the Senate usually deliberates in private. The Constitution requires a two-thirds supermajority to convict a person being impeached.[16] The Senate enters judgment on its decision, whether that be to convict or acquit, and a copy of the judgment is filed with the Secretary of State.[15]\n\nUpon conviction in the Senate, the official is automatically removed from office and may by a separate vote also be barred from holding future office. The Senate trial is not an actual criminal proceeding and more closely resembles a civil service termination appeal in terms of the contemplated deprivation. Therefore, the removed official may still be liable to criminal prosecution under a subsequent criminal proceeding. The president may not grant a pardon in the impeachment case, but may in any resulting federal criminal case (unless it is the president who is convicted and thus loses the pardon power). However, whether the president can self-pardon for criminal offenses is an open question, which has never been reviewed by a court.[17][failed verification – see discussion]\n\nBeginning in the 1980s with Harry E. Claiborne, the Senate began using \"Impeachment Trial Committees\" pursuant to Senate Rule XI.[15] These committees presided over the evidentiary phase of the trials, hearing the evidence and supervising the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The committees would then compile the evidentiary record and present it to the Senate; all senators would then have the opportunity to review the evidence before the chamber voted to convict or acquit. The purpose of the committees was to streamline impeachment trials, which otherwise would have taken up a great deal of the chamber's time. Defendants challenged the use of these committees, claiming them to be a violation of their fair trial rights as this did not meet the constitutional requirement for their cases to be \"tried by the Senate\". Several impeached judges, including District Court Judge Walter Nixon, sought court intervention in their impeachment proceedings on these grounds. In Nixon v. United States (1993),[18] the Supreme Court determined that the federal judiciary could not review such proceedings, as matters related to impeachment trials are political questions and could not be resolved in the courts.[19]\n\nIn the case of impeachment of the president, the chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial. During the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, some Senate Republicans argued that the chief justice was required to preside, even though Trump was no longer the president when the trial began. However, by a 55–45 vote, the Senate rejected a motion asserting that the trial was unconstitutional.[9] The trial was presided over by president pro tempore Patrick Leahy.\n\nThe Constitution is silent about who would preside in the case of the impeachment of a vice president. It is doubtful the vice president would be permitted to preside over their own trial.[citation needed] As president of the Senate, the vice president would preside over other impeachments. If the vice president did not preside over an impeachment (of anyone besides the president), the duties would fall to the president pro tempore of the Senate.\n\nTo convict an accused, \"the concurrence of two thirds of the [senators] present\" for at least one article is required. If there is no single charge commanding a \"guilty\" vote from two-thirds of the senators present, the defendant is acquitted and no punishment is imposed.\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Senate trial for the Impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security, ended after the Senate dismissed the accusations by agreeing to a point of order that the articles of impeachment did not comply with the United States Constitution.[20] The majority of the Senate ruled that the articles accusing Mayorkas of willfully and systematically refusing to comply with Federal immigration laws and breaching the public trust did not \"allege conduct that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor\".[21]\n\nConviction immediately removes the defendant from office. Following the vote on conviction, the Senate may by a separate vote also bar the individual from holding future federal office, elected or appointed. As the threshold for disqualification is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, the Senate has taken the position that disqualification votes only require a simple majority rather than a two-thirds supermajority. The Senate has used disqualification sparingly, as only three individuals (West Hughes Humphreys, Robert W. Archbald, and Thomas Porteous) have been disqualified from holding future office.[22][23][24]\n\nConviction does not extend to further punishment, for example, loss of pension. After conviction by the Senate, \"the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law\"[25] in the regular federal or state courts. However, the Former Presidents Act of 1958, which provides a pension and other benefits, does not extend to presidents who were removed from office following an impeachment conviction. Because of an amendment to that law in 2013, a former president who has been removed from office due to impeachment and conviction is still guaranteed lifetime Secret Service protection.[26]\n\nState legislatures can impeach state officials, including governors and judicial officers, in every state.[27][28] The court for the trial of impeachments may differ somewhat from the federal model—in New York, for instance, the Assembly (lower house) impeaches, and the State Senate tries the case, but the members of the seven-judge New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest, constitutional court) sit with the senators as jurors as well.[29] Impeachment and removal of governors has happened occasionally throughout the history of the United States, usually for corruption charges. At least eleven U.S. state governors have faced an impeachment trial; a twelfth, Governor Lee Cruce of Oklahoma, escaped impeachment by one vote in 1912. Several others, including Missouri's Eric Greitens in 2018, have resigned rather than face impeachment, when events seemed to make it inevitable.[30] The most recent impeachment of a state governor occurred on January 14, 2009, when the Illinois House of Representatives voted 117–1 to impeach Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges;[31] he was subsequently removed from office and barred from holding future office by the Illinois Senate on January 29.\n\nIn addition, the legislatures of the territories of American Samoa,[32] Northern Mariana Islands,[33] and Puerto Rico have impeachment powers.[34]\n\nThe procedure for impeachment, or removal, of local officials varies widely. For instance, in New York a mayor can be removed directly by the governor \"upon being heard\" on charges—the law makes no further specification of what charges are necessary or what the governor must find in order to remove a mayor.\n\nIn 2018, the entire Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia was impeached, something that has been often threatened, but had never happened before.\n\nMost states follow the same model as the United States federal government of having the lower chamber of their legislatures hold a vote to \"impeach\", thereby triggering an impeachment trial held in the upper chamber of their legislatures. However, several states do differ from the convention of holding the impeachment trial in the state legislature's upper chamber. In a reverse, in Alaska it is the upper chamber of the legislature that votes to impeach while the lower chamber acts as the court of impeachment.[27] In Missouri, after the lower chamber votes to impeach, an impeachment trial is held before the Supreme Court of Missouri, except for members of that court or for governors, whose impeachments are to be tried by a panel of seven judges (requiring a vote of five judges to convict), with the members of the panel being selected by the upper legislative chamber, the Missouri State Senate.[35] In Nebraska, which has a unicameral legislature, after the Nebraska Legislature votes to impeach, an impeachment trial takes place before the Nebraska Supreme Court.[27] In addition to all the members of its upper chamber, the state of New York's Court of the Trial of Impeachments also includes all seven members of the state's highest court, the New York Court of Appeals.[36]\n\nOther governments and organizations in the United States also utilize impeachment.\n\nMany tribal governments have impeachment, with tribes generally utilizing a similar bifurcated process to the federal government, having an impeachment vote followed by an impeachment trial.[37] Examples of tribal governments that have an impeachment process include the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation[38] Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation,[39] Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians,[40] and Oglala Sioux.[41][42]\n\nThe Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) Confederacy's Great Law of Peace, which predates the constitution of the United States, includes what amounts to an impeachment process through which clan mothers can remove and replace a sachem for misdeeds. This is unique in that only a tribe's women are allowed to remove a sachem through this process.[43][44]\n\nA notable Native impeachment attempt was the 1975 effort to impeach Dick Wilson as chairman of the Oglala of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. This immediately preceded the Wounded Knee Occupation.[45]\n\nExamples of Native tribal officials that were impeached include:\n\nSome municipal governments currently or previously have had to power to impeach municipal officials such as mayors.[59] Cities where municipal governments allow impeachment proceedings include cities such as Houston, Texas.[60][61] An example of an impeachment by a municipal government is that of Philip Tomppert, who was removed through impeachment as the mayor of Louisville, Kentucky by the Louisville Board of Aldermen (city council) in 1865.[62]\n\nThere are other organizations in the United States that have impeachment procedures, including students' union (\"student government\"/\"student council\") organizations.[63]\n\nSeveral of the Thirteen Colonies belonging to England that later formed the original states of the United States of America held impeachments. Impeachment was a process carried over from England. Unlike in modern America, but similarly to the practice of impeachment in England, in at least some colonies impeachment was a process that could also be used to try non-officeholders and give criminal penalties.[64] However, in practice, the colonies primarily limited their impeachments to officeholders and punishment to removal from office. Most charges in impeachments were related to misconduct in office.[65] Impeachments in the colonies used a similar bifurcated process to the common modern practice of an impeachment vote followed by an impeachment trial.[64][65] Like the English impeachment practice and modern United States federal impeachment practice, the charges would be brought by a colonial legislature's lower chamber and tried in its upper chamber.[65]\n\nSome states were independent governments before being admitted into the United States. In Vermont, some impeachments took place prior to its statehood.[66][67]\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States government.",

    "fullText": "Welcome! MySQL for Developers is PlanetScale’s free MySQL course that teaches you schema basics, indexing, querying, and beyond. This intermediate MySQL course is appropriate for both developers just getting started with MySQL and those who need a refresher. The course has been created with usability and application in mind. Everything you learn in this course can be taken and applied to your own applications to make them faster and more efficent.\n\nWe’ll be breaking the course down into several sections, starting with the schema and covering everything from data types to indexes, to querying, and much more.\n\nIn the first section of the course, we’re going to start by looking at schema basics. What makes an effective table? How do different data types in MySQL work? When should you use one type over another? We’ll also look at the drawbacks of certain data types and how to avoid them while building a schema. This is the foundation for the rest of the course, so make sure you understand these concepts before moving on to more advanced topics.\n\nIn the next section of the course, we’ll cover indexing in depth. What is an index, and why is it so fast? How can we make the most of it when building our schema? We’ll cover all of these questions and \n\nIn the third section of the course, we’ll cover querying. How do we write efficient and effective MySQL queries? How do we use the indexes we built earlier to make our queries super fast? This section builds on everything we’ve covered in the previous sections, so make sure you have a strong foundation before attempting it.\n\nIn the final section of the course, we’ll take everything we’ve learned and put it together into a series of examples that application developers often encounter. By the end of this section, you’ll have a deep understanding of how to build efficient and effective MySQL databases that work well for your applications.\n\nThis course is designed specifically for developers, so no prior knowledge of databases is required. We won’t be covering low-level details or administration, as this course is focused on how to use MySQL effectively as an application developer. If you’ve found databases intimidating in the past, don’t worry—we’ll take it step by step, and you’ll be an expert user by the end of the course.\n\nThroughout the course, we’ll be using a TablePlus client on my Mac to run queries and view results. You’ll see me on screen sometimes, and most of the time, I’ll be up in the corner while we look at the TablePlus client. We won’t be using a lot of slides, as I know they can be boring. Instead, we’ll be getting hands-on and looking at actual tables, queries, indexes, and more within the TablePlus client.\n\nThis course covers everything you need to know to become an expert user of MySQL as a developer. We’ll start with the basics of schema and data types, move on to indexing and querying, and finish up with real-world examples. By the end of the course, you’ll have a deep understanding of how to build efficient and effective MySQL databases that work well for your applications. I hope you enjoy the course and learn a lot!\n\nFeedback or questions? Reach out to our team at education@planetscale.com.",

    "fullText": "Dearborn, Michigan — In a striking signal that one of America’s oldest and most iconic automakers is recalibrating its future, Ford Authority reports that CEO Jim Farley has openly stated that Ford will not try to make cars for everyone. Instead of pursuing a broad strategy that caters to all segments of the market, the company under Farley’s leadership is narrowing its focus to areas of strength like trucks, commercial vehicles and select electrified models, even if it means retreating from certain all-electric ambitions.\n\nFarley’s comments reflect a broader strategic pivot away from the aggressive electric vehicle push that Ford once championed. Earlier this year, Ford had touted the F-150 Lightning electric pickup as a centerpiece for its battery-electric future. That plan has since been upended, with production of the all-electric Lightning ending in 2025. This decision accompanies a massive $19.5 billion charge tied to restructuring its EV business, primarily Model e, the division responsible for electric vehicles. This writedown underscores real financial pain from years of heavy investment without corresponding profits.\n\nThe shift comes as consumer demand for expensive EVs remains weak, particularly at price points above $50,000. Farley and other Ford executives have signaled that much of the company’s cash-burning electric lineup simply did not sell in volume and that the market’s adoption curve for EVs has been flatter than anticipated. Instead, Ford plans to reallocate investment toward hybrid vehicles, extended-range electrics, and more traditionally profitable trucks like the F-150 and commercial vans.\n\nThis change of direction also has real human and industrial consequences. In Kentucky, a battery plant built for EV production laid off all 1,600 workers as part of the shift away from manufacturing electric cars. Ford, however, is looking to refit this facility for battery storage products and other energy solutions to serve data centers and infrastructure projects. This move reflects a belief that the Blue Oval’s future lie within and beyond automotive assembly.\n\nDespite these shifts, Ford won’t dare abandon electrification entirely. The company is still developing vehicles on its Universal EV Platform, a modular architecture designed to support a range of smaller and more affordable electric models. The timeline for profitability in the EV business has been pushed out to 2029, a slower trajectory than originally envisioned, but one that executives reckon is more realistic given current market dynamics.",

    "fullText": "During the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, the company’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, threw steel balls at the truck to demonstrate its sturdiness, but instead shattered two windows. In an interview, von Holzhausen said the mishap became a “great marketing moment.” Tesla began selling T-shirts alluding to the accident, and CEO Elon Musk claimed the company saw 200,000 orders for Cybertrucks in the days following its launch.\n\nSome may call Franz von Holzhausen’s accidental destruction of a Tesla Cybertruck window a blunder; von Holzhausen would prefer to call it a “great meme” instead.\n\nDuring the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, von Holzhausen, the company’s chief designer, threw steel balls at the vehicle, intending to demonstrate the windows CEO Elon Musk that said were made of “armor glass” were indeed extra tough. The windows, however, unexpectedly shattered, leaving Musk to deliver the rest of his presentation of the new truck while standing in front of the damaged car. Tesla’s stock fell more than 5% the next day.\n\nWhile the incident seemed like an omen, indicative of the Cybertruck being poised to fail, the botched demonstration actually opened up an opportunity to give the new model a spotlight, von Holzhausen said in an interview with Tesla Club Austria published earlier this year.\n\n“It was just one of those Murphy’s Law kind of things where something bad happens, but it turned out to be a great meme,” von Holzhausen said, referring to the phenomenon of when something can go wrong, it usually will. “And I think in an odd sort of way—we don’t do marketing—but it turned into a great marketing moment.”\n\nHe added, “It was not an expected moment, but in that moment, you have to roll with it.”\n\nFollowing the reveal of the vehicle, Musk posted a video on X of von Holzhausen throwing a steel ball at the model Cybertruck before its launch, with its windows withstanding the force of the throw with no visible damage. The video was viewed more than 6 million times within three days of its posting.\n\n“Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha,” Musk wrote.\n\nDays later, Musk touted the success of the Cybertruck launch, saying Tesla had received more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle. While Tesla does not break out Cybertruck numbers when it reports earnings, instead grouping them with the Model S and X, the company recalled nearly all of the Cybertrucks it had on the road earlier this year due to an issue in which an exterior panel could become detached, and that only tallied around 46,000 vehicles.",

    "fullText": "The idea of retiring with a $1 million nest egg has been sold as the finish line for decades—but for most retirees, that number is out of reach.\n\nData from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, shows that only 4.7% of Americans have at least $1 million saved in retirement-specific accounts such as 401ks and IRAs.

Half of retirees 75 and over have less than $130,000 saved—a figure that doesn't stretch far when you factor in rising medical costs, inflation, and daily living expenses.\n\nIn fact, according to Fidelity, older Americans should aim to have around 10 times their pre-retirement income saved by age 67 to maintain their standard of living. The gap between that target and actual savings underscores why many retirees are left navigating tough financial choices.\n\nAnd it's not just about individual effort. According to a 2024 report from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, an estimated 39% of working households are projected to fall short of maintaining their pre-retirement standard of living. That number reflects households nearing or at retirement age.\n\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

He promised that Putin would not be able to influence a possible vote on the future Ukrainian president.\n\nThe criticism was triggered by Putin's statements on Friday at his annual press conference, where he not only once again demanded presidential elections in the neighbouring country he invaded and criticized the current Ukrainian leadership as illegitimate, but also insisted that Ukrainians living in Russia should participate in the vote.\n\nPutin said there are between 5 million and 10 million Ukrainians in Russia. There are no diplomatic missions of Ukraine in Russia, where citizens abroad would normally vote. Putin's election official, Ella Pamfilova, said that the Russian authorities could organize the voting there.\n\nNo elections in Russia and occupied territories\n\n\"Ukrainian citizens who are in Ukraine in the Ukrainian-controlled areas will vote,\" Zelensky said in response.\n\nOnly there could honest and transparent elections be guaranteed, he said. In addition, there is the usual practice of voting in foreign missions.\n\n\"In the areas not controlled by Ukraine, no elections can be held because it is clear that they would be conducted there as Russia always does,\" he said, referring to international criticism of the questionable fairness of elections in Russia.\n\nMartial law prohibits elections during wartime\n\nPutin, who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has repeatedly stated since last year that Zelensky is no longer legitimate due to his expired term.\n\nKiev, however, points to martial law, which prohibits elections during wartime, thereby extending Zelensky's term. Internationally, Zelensky is still recognized as the Ukrainian president.\n\nRecently, however, US President Donald Trump adopted Putin's demand for new elections in Ukraine. Zelensky expressed his willingness to do so but demanded a ceasefire during the election to ensure the security of the vote.\n\nPutin's re-election in March 2024 was also sharply criticized as illegitimate in Western countries. The German government, for instance, classified the vote as \"neither free nor fair.\"\n\nReal opposition candidates were not allowed, there was a climate of intimidation, and there is no freedom of expression, said the then spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann.

    "description": "Scientists have sought out and detected radio emissions from from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming what most scientists have been thinking.",
    "fullText": "The most sensational story of the year for astronomers has been the discovery of the comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed on July 1, 2025 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Although comets regularly pass by Earth, the most famous being Halley's Comet, there's something extra-special about this new find. Halley's and other well-known comets originated within our solar system, birthed from the same planet-forming disk that the sun, Earth, and all the other planets emerged from. What makes 3I/ATLAS so fascinating is that it originated somewhere beyond the solar system, and made its way here through interstellar space. As if that weren't an exciting enough discovery, a radio telescope has noticed that the comet is emitting something.\n\nThe MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa picked up on 3I/ATLAS in late October, as the comet was nearing its closest point to the sun. This finding was widely reported as radio signals emitting from 3I/ATLAS, which prompted conspiracy theorists to speculate that the object may actually be a piece of alien technology. This isn't quite accurate though. Technically, everything gives off electromagnet radiation, and what MeerKAT found wasn't an audio transmission like the kind we hear on a car radio. What it actually found were gaps in the radio spectrum caused by the absorption of radio waves by OH molecules, also known as hydroxyl radicals. OH molecules — the remnants of water torn apart by solar radiation — are regularly observed in comets that pass within range of Earth, which seemingly puts to bed any speculation that the 3I/ATLAS is anything other than a comet. However, it doesn't answer the question of where 3I/ATLAS originated from.\n\nThe discovery of 3I/ATLAS marked just the third time that astronomers have observed an interstellar object passing through our solar system. The \"3I\" in its name actually stands for \"third interstellar\" for this reason. The previous two interstellar objects observed by astronauts were 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2017 and 2019 respectively. The fact that all known interstellar visitors to our solar system were discovered in the past decade is a sign of great strides in astronomical technology, but it also means that we have been able to gather very little data thus far about interstellar comets. One thing does stand out, however. Both 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov came from the direction of the Milky Way's center, but 3I/ATLAS is coming from a perpendicular angle.\n\nBased on the trajectory, it's likely that the comet originated in a part of the galaxy that astronomers haven't even observed yet. NASA is gathering images of 3I/ATLAS, as is the European Space Agency, and both expect to have more satellite and probe data ready to analyze by early 2026; however, it is highly unlikely that we'll ever be able to pinpoint the exact origin of the comet. While scientists don't know where it came from, they do have a good idea of where 3I/ATLAS is going, and you can rest assured that it won't hit Earth. In fact, the comet won't even come as close to us as the sun is.\n\nThe intrusion of an interstellar object into our solar system immediately caught the attention of every alien enthusiast out there, and not just the typical podcast conspirators. A professor at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics is arguing that 3I/ATLAS could be a piece of alien technology. Professor Avi Loeb has published numerous articles about the interstellar object on his blog, going against the consensus of his peers in the scientific community. He argues that 3I/ATLAS exhibits several anomalies compared to the previous two interstellar comets that have been tracked through our solar system. Compared to that pair, 3I/ATLAS is far more massive, yet moves faster. He also notes that the gas plume surrounding 3I/ATLAS contains similar levels of nickel to industrial alloys.\n\nThe recently recorded radio signals from 3I/ATLAS are yet another dent in Loeb's theory, which has been roundly rebuked by other astrophysicists. Counterarguments point out that comets often show inconsistent features. It's impossible to say what is normal and what is anomalous, and that is especially true in the case of interstellar comets. Loeb actually hits the nail on the head in an article titled, The Tale of 3I/ATLAS and Sterile Neutrinos, wherein he asks, \"How can anyone claim to be an expert of interstellar objects when the sample size includes only two previously known examples?\" In all likelihood, many of our questions about 3I/ATLAS won't be answerable until we have observed other interstellar comets in the future.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Residents of a neighborhood in Singapore are on high alert after a venomous snake was spotted in a playground.\n\nAccording to Must Share News, the scaly interloper was found in a children's play area in  Sembawang, a suburban town in Singapore's north region. It was identified as a black spitting cobra (Naja sumatrana), not to be mistaken for its similarly-named cousin, the black-necked spitting cobra (Naja nigricollis).\n\nThe sighting was reported to the authorities, but the animal had slithered away before it could be safely removed from the park. Residents were concerned about the danger the snake could have posed to children. Some were also worried about the park's cats and those who feed the stray felines.\n\nChelsia Lee, who shared the images on social media covered by Must Share News, told the outlet, \"I hope feeders will be more alert during this period when most snakes are likely to come out to seek warmth from the cold weather.\"\n\nAlso known as the Equatorial spitting cobra, the snake is known for its primary defense mechanism: spitting venom into the eyes of attackers. Some species can hit their mark from a range of two meters with startling accuracy, so it's definitely not a good idea to get too close.\n\nHowever, the main danger comes from its bite. While fatalities are extremely rare, they have occurred, and those with underlying health issues are at greater risk.\n\nAs development expands, with construction often pushing into green spaces, human-wildlife conflicts are more likely to occur. Moreover, as natural habitats are destroyed and food and water become scarcer, previously unobserved species may be forced into residential areas.\n\nIn most instances, and certainly with the black spitting cobra, the animals don't truly mean any harm to people and will only attack if they feel threatened. Indeed, snakes can play an important role in controlling rodent populations and reducing the spread of vector-borne diseases.\n\nIt's typically a matter of raising awareness and informing loved ones about sensible precautions to take in an urban wildlife encounter. In the vast majority of cases, simply keeping your distance and being aware of your surroundings is more than enough to stay safe.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Scientists watching the nearby Fomalhaut star system have directly seen two protoplanets smash together for the first time. Then, they saw it happen again.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAstronomers hoping to observe a planet around a nearby star have witnessed a much rarer \"unprecedented celestial event,\" the team said: The violent aftermath of not one, but two collisions between the rocky building blocks of planets.\n\nOver the past two decades, astronomers witnessed two separate catastrophic collisions around the star Fomalhaut, located just 25 light-years away in the constellation Piscis Austrinus. The detections occurred after planetesimals (rocky pieces of unformed planets) measuring much larger than the dinosaur-killing asteroid smashed each other into massive clouds of glittering debris.\n\nThe Fomalhaut system is no stranger to such crashes. It's famously known as the \"Eye of Sauron\" due to its resemblance to the fiery, all-seeing eye from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of The Rings franchise. The likeness comes from the spectacular dust belt that surrounds Fomalhaut at a distance of 133 astronomical units (AU), with one AU being equal to 93 million miles (150 million km) — the average distance between the sun and Earth.\n\nFormed from countless rocky, icy collisions, this belt of dust and debris provides a dustier analog of our early solar system as it appeared more than 4 billion years ago, the team said — offering a glimpse of our neighborhood's chaotic infancy, when planets were being created, destroyed, and reassembled.\n\nA new study, conducted by an international team of researchers and led by Paul Kalas, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, described these two collision events in destructive detail to help solve a planetary mystery.\n\nIn the early 2000s, astronomers observing the Fomalhaut system spotted a large, luminous object that many assumed to be a dust-covered exoplanet reflecting light. They designated this exoplanet candidate Fomalhaut b.\n\nYet when this supposed planet blinked out of existence and another bright point of light appeared nearby, all in the span of approximately 20 years, researchers realized they weren't viewing planets, but the shining debris clouds formed by what they call a \"cosmic fender bender.\"\n\nThe two collision events, now known as Fomalhaut cs1 and Fomalhaut cs2, appear to be incredibly serendipitous. Theory suggests that collisions of this size should only happen once every 100,000 years or so, but the Fomalhaut system surprised scientists with two such smash-ups in just 20 years.\n\nIndeed, based on this timeline, the study infers that 22 million similar events may have occurred during the Fomalhaut system's relatively young, 440-million-year-old life so far. Even if one could rewind only the past 3,000 years or so, \"Fomalhaut's planetary system would be sparkling with these collisions,\" Kalas explained in a statement.\n\nReverse engineering the collisions based on factors like the mass of the debris clouds and the size of the dust grains suggests that Fomalhaut cs1 and cs2 were the result of colliding planetesimals around 37 miles (60 km) in diameter, or around four to six times the size of the asteroid that devastated the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\n\nIt's an alien event with a relatable twist: \"These larger bodies are like the larger bodies that comprise our own asteroid and Kuiper belts,\" study co-author Jason Wang, an astronomer at Northwestern University, told Live Science via email.\n\nAnd there are a lot of these bodies. Based on their reconstruction of the event, the researchers suggest that the Fomalhaut system may host 1.8 Earth masses of these primordial planetesimals. This may amount to about 300 million such bodies, according to a separate statement.\n\nFurthermore, the system holds another 1.8 Earth masses in smaller bodies measuring less than 0.186 miles (0.3 kilometers) across. These relative runts constantly replenish the tiny dust grains, many just a few 10,000ths of an inch in size, that swirl and shimmer in Fomalhaut's dust belt. Without this rocky reservoir, the dust belt would disappear as its grains are blown out of the system by stellar wind or engulfed by its star.\n\nEven though Fomalhaut b no longer exists — as a planet, at least — this \"planet that never was\" may actually still be hiding within the system.\n\nResearchers calculated that, given the specific conditions, there's about a 10% chance that Fomalhaut cs1 and cs2 are not random collisions. Their similar timing and location may point to a hidden influence, such as the ghostly gravitational pull of an unseen exoplanet.\n\n\"For example, something — like planets — should be responsible for carving out the planetesimals into a dust belt that we see,\" Wang told LiveScience. \"Additionally, we speculate that the proximity in location of the cs1 and cs2 impact sites may be driven by a planet that preferentially causes planetesimals to collide there.\"\n\nThis exoplanetary confusion highlights an important consideration for planet-hunters, and for next-generation facilities like NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory that are designed to directly image habitable-zone exoplanets in the nearby universe: \"Fomalhaut cs2 looks exactly like an extrasolar planet reflecting starlight,\" explained Kalas.\n\nAs a result, this unique study not only informs our ideas about planetary formation, such as collision rates and debris belt mechanics, but can also help astronomers more precisely identify planetary bodies from among all the other shining celestial objects with which the universe continually dazzles us.",

    "title": "'I'm a Gastroenterologist—This Is the One Snack I Wish Everyone Would Avoid'",
    "description": "Plus, see their zero-prep, gut-approved snack recommendations.",
    "fullText": "For most people, wanting a snack at least once during the day is inevitable. Even if you eat a hearty breakfast and lunch, it’s bound to happen. Sometimes we crave snacks because we’re truly hungry. Other times, we might be bored, stressed or just want something to munch on.\n\nIt’s certainly not unhealthy to have a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack, even if it’s something you do every day. In fact, an article published in the International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition says that having one to two snacks a day can be even more nutritious than having three meals a day and no snacks. This is because having a snack or two throughout the day can prevent overeating at meals, which puts less stress on the digestive and metabolic systems.\n\nOf course, it all comes down to what you decide to snack on. We asked three gastroenterologists for their recommendations on what snacks to eat—and which snacks to avoid—when it comes to snacking for gut health. Keep reading to find out what they said.\n\n“As a gastroenterologist, the one snack I’d love people to step away from is ultra-processed chips, [specifically] fried chips that come in crinkly bags with a long ingredients list that includes refined starches, industrial oils, artificial flavors, ‘cheese powders’ and preservatives,” says Dr. Jason Korenblit, MD, a gastroenterologist and digestive expert with Just Answer.\n\nDr. Korenblit explains that chips are a textbook example of an ultra-processed food, which he says can negatively impact gut health. “Diets high in ultra-processed foods are consistently linked with worse gut health, inflammatory bowel disease, IBS and colorectal cancer as well as obesity, diabetes and heart disease,” he says.\n\nHe explains that if someone eats chips once in a while, it’s not that big a deal. But if someone eats chips every day, it’s going to negatively impact the gut in a few ways.\n\n“Your gut bacteria live on fiber and resistant starch, the parts of plant foods we don’t fully digest. When you mostly snack on chips, which are nearly fiber-free, you’re feeding you but not them. High-fiber diets, in contrast, support diverse, resilient microbiota and production of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, which reduce inflammation and strengthen the gut barrier,” Dr. Korenblit says, adding that snacking on nutrient-void chips over time can lead to less beneficial gut bacteria and increase inflammation (caused by the high-frying temperatures, which create inflammation-causing compounds).\n\n“Emerging data suggests that some emulsifiers and additives can disrupt the mucus layer that protects the intestinal wall and alter the microbiome in ways that promote inflammation and increased gut permeability,” he continues, adding that this is associated with IBS. “That doesn’t mean one serving of chips ‘destroys your gut,’ but regular exposure may nudge the system toward low-grade inflammation over years,” he says.\n\nPairing your chips with soda can negatively impact the gut even more. “I wish we could eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages,” says Dr. Trisha Pasricha, MD, MPH, an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, director of the Institute for Gut-Brain Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and author of the upcoming book, You’ve Been Pooping All Wrong, saying that they have been identified as a risk factor for early-onset colorectal cancer.\n\n🩺\nIf you want to support your gut, it’s clear that having a daily snack of chips and soda is out. What should you snack on instead? Dr. Paul Feuerstadt, MD, FACG, AGAF, a gastroenterologist, member of the board of directors at the Peggy Lillis Foundation and an associate clinical professor at Yale School of Medicine, recommends choosing unprocessed foods that are high in fiber.\n\nFor example, some snacks that Dr. Feuerstadt recommends are nuts, berries and legume-based snacks, like hummus or crunchy chickpeas. He explains that these snacks support gut health in their own unique ways, including by upping the amount of diverse and beneficial bacteria in the gut.\n\n“Personally, I keep a jar of almonds in my office. Nuts are high in protein and fiber, so they keep you satisfied and nourished,” Dr. Pasricha says.\n\nDr. Feuerstadt and Dr. Korenblit agree that yogurt is a great gut-healthy snack too, due to its high probiotic content.\n\n“Yogurt with live and active cultures provides beneficial bacteria, aka probiotics, that can help support a healthy microbiome and may reduce inflammation and dysbiosis [imbalance]. Regular yogurt intake has been associated with favorable shifts in gut microbes and lower risk of certain colorectal cancers,” Dr. Korenblit says, explaining that pairing your yogurt with nuts and berries provides additional gut-supporting benefits. He adds that it also makes the yogurt more satiating, due to the unsaturated fats, fiber and protein.\n\nSupporting your gut health through your snack choice doesn’t mean eating “perfectly” or never enjoying chips, soda, or other ultra-processed foods and drinks.\n\n“Don’t aim for perfection. Aim for building a healthier eating pattern. Your health is going to see greater gains if you make changes that you actually enjoy and can stick with for years, rather than changes you hate and quit after two intense and horrible weeks,” Dr. Pasicha says.\n\nTo make healthy snacking easier, stock your kitchen with nutrient-rich, grab-and-go options the experts shared earlier, like yogurt, berries, nuts, crunchy chickpeas or hummus and veggies. Not only will you be supporting your gut, but you’ll feel more satiated than you would after eating a handful of chips.\n\nDr. Jason Korenblit, MD, gastroenterologist and digestive expert with Just Answer\n\nDr. Trisha Pasricha, MD, MPH, instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, director of the Institute for Gut-Brain Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and author of the upcoming book, You’ve Been Pooping All Wrong\n\nDr. Paul Feuerstadt, MD, FACG, AGAF, gastroenterologist who is a member of the board of directors at the Peggy Lillis Foundation and an associate clinical professor at Yale School of Medicine\n\nMarangoni, F., Martini, D., Scaglioni, S., et al.

    "description": "A 31-year-old Pakistani man, who went missing in June 1997 in an ice cave, was found perfectly preserved by a local shepherd.",
    "fullText": "Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:\n\nA 31-year-old Pakistani man, who went missing in June 1997 in an ice cave, was found perfectly preserved by a local shepherd.\n\nThe discovery puts an end to a painful three-decade-long search for a family that tirelessly searched for his body in the mountainous Kohistan region.\n\nAs glaciers retreat around the world due to climate change, discoveries of bodies or ancient artifacts will likely increase as melting ice reveals their frozen tombs.\n\nIn June 1997, a 31-year-old Pakistani man by the name Naseeruddin, while traveling in the Supat Valley in the mountainous northern region of Pakistan called Kohistan, disappeared into a cave never to be seen again. He left behind a wife and two children, and for years, the family of the missing man searched the area for any sign of him—ultimately, to no avail.\n\n“Our family left no stone unturned to trace him over the years,” Malik Ubaid, the nephew of the deceased, told the AFP. “Our uncles and cousins visited the glacier several times to see if his body could be retrieved, but they eventually gave up as it wasn’t possible.”\n\nAfter nearly three decades, the search for Naseeruddin has finally come to an end. On July 31, a local shepherd in the valley named Omar Khan discovered the missing man’s body, with an identity card still on him. But that wasn’t the only surprise.\n\n“What I saw was unbelievable,” Khan told BBC Urdu. “The body was intact. The clothes were not even torn.”\n\nFor 28 years, Naseeruddin lay mummified in the glacial ice. He underwent a quick freezing process that then protected the body from moisture and oxygen. Pakistan is home to some 7,000 glaciers—the largest amount outside of Earth’s polar regions—and like many glaciers around the world, these ice giants are slowly disappearing due to anthropogenic climate change.\n\nIn northern Pakistan, climate change has caused decreased snowfall in the region, leading to more direct sunlight melting the glaciers. This unnatural warming is what eventually exposed Naseeruddin’s body, allowing the passing shepherd to finally put a painful mystery to rest.\n\n“Finally, we have got some relief after the recovery of his dead body,” Ubaid said.\n\nGlaciers and other icy bodies, such as ice sheets, are basically planetary time capsules. Scientists around the world frequently drill ice cores to measure past climactic events by analyzing trapped air bubbles, as well as the isotropic composition of the surrounding ice. They can also provide incredible glimpses into humanity’s past. While many amazing artifacts have been found encased in glacial ice, the most famous frozen finding is Ötzi, also known as The Iceman, who was found in the Italian Alps in 1991 with his soft tissues and organs intact. This discovery provided an unprecedented glimpse into life and times and neolithic Europe.\n\nWhile glaciers are amazing at preserving soft tissue (scientists even know what Ötzi’s last meal was), they aren’t as effective as cryogenic freezing, which can perfectly preserve an organism. This is why Ötzi, as well as other bodies of frozen WWI soldiers discovered in 2017, still show signs of decomposition and dehydration.\n\nSadly, Naseeruddin’s fate is one shared by many intrepid explorers who venture into these dangerous and cold altitudes. Last year, National Geographic reported the partial recovery of mountaineer Sandy Irvine, who disappeared on Everest a century ago. In fact, crews regularly conducted clean-up campaigns on the world’s tallest peak, often finding long-lost climbers frozen along the mountainside.\n\nWith glaciers rapidly in retreat around the world, we’ll soon see what other mysteries—both tragic and wondrous—that may lay hidden at the top of the world.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "World War II Navy veteran Ira “Ike” Schab, one of the dwindling number of survivors of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 105.\n\nDaughter Kimberlee Heinrichs told The Associated Press that Schab died at home early Saturday in the presence of her and her husband.\n\nWith his passing, there remain only about a dozen survivors of the surprise attack, which killed just over 2,400 troops and propelled the United States into the war.\n\nSchab was a sailor of just 21 at the time of the attack, and for decades he rarely spoke about the experience.\n\nBut in recent years, aware that the corps of survivors was dwindling, the centenarian made a point of traveling from his home in Beaverton, Oregon, to the annual observance at the Hawaii military base.\n\n“To pay honor to the guys that didn’t make it,” he said in 2023.\n\nFor last year's commemoration, Schab spent weeks building up the strength to be able to stand and salute.\n\nBut this year he did not feel well enough to attend, and less than three weeks later, he passed away.\n\nBorn on Independence Day in 1920 in Chicago, Schab was the eldest of three brothers.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 18, following in the footsteps of his father, he said in a February interview for Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nOn what began as a peaceful Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, Schab, who played the tuba in the USS Dobbin’s band, was expecting a visit from his brother, a fellow service member assigned to a nearby naval radio station. Schab had just showered and donned a clean uniform when he heard a call for fire rescue.\n\nHe went topside and saw another ship, the USS Utah, capsizing. Japanese planes roared through the air.\n\n“We were pretty startled. Startled and scared to death,” Schab recalled in 2023. “We didn’t know what to expect, and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it.”\n\nHe scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun above.\n\nHis ship lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action, and two died later of fragment wounds from a bomb that struck the stern. All had been manning an anti-aircraft gun.\n\nSchab spent most of the war with the Navy in the Pacific, going to the New Hebrides, now known as Vanuatu, and then the Mariana Islands and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nAfter the war he studied aerospace engineering and worked on the Apollo spaceflight program as an electrical engineer for General Dynamics, helping send astronauts to the moon.\n\nSchab's son also joined the Navy and is a retired commander.\n\nSpeaking at a 2022 ceremony, Schab asked people to honor those who served at Pearl Harbor.\n\n“Remember what they’re here for. Remember and honor those that are left. They did a hell of a job,” he said. “Those who are still here, dead or alive.”",

The more militarized BOPE division took up positions on the surrounding hills of the favela complexes, where some 280,000 people live.Police estimated there were some 500 armed gang members in Penha, and hundreds",

    "description": "Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said he had been naive to assume that “when we made information available, that people would want correct information.”",
    "fullText": "Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning senior reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia.\n\nThere are many problems billionaire tech tycoon Bill Gates is hoping to help solve: eradicating polio, water sanitization, and agricultural development to name a few. But one frontier he worries is being passed on to future generations is misinformation.\n\nMisinformation is a problem, the Microsoft cofounder said, that we are “handing to the younger generation.”\n\nSpeaking to CNBC Make It, Gates, worth $118 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said he had been naive to assume that “when we made information available, that people would want correct information.”\n\nA high-profile figure himself, Gates has seen scrutiny extend to his family. His daughter Phoebe, in particular, has struggled with being harassed online.\n\n“Hearing my daughter talk about how she’d been harassed online, and how her friends experienced that quite a bit, brought that into focus in a way that I hadn’t thought about before,” Gates—a father of three—continued.\n\nGates’ youngest daughter—co-founder of AI shopping tool Phia—has previously spoken about misconceptions surrounding her family and relationships, including being “memed for being in an interracial relationship.”\n\nAn internet meme is an image or video, usually intended to be humorous, that is spread online.\n\nDespite being aware of how misinformation is spreading online, Gates said he can understand why certain audiences flock to platforms that reflect their views—a phenomenon known as confirmation bias.\n\n“We have context where we want correct information, like hopefully when we want medical advice,” Gates said. “But then we kind of like, in our community and enclave, have these shared views that kind of pull us together.”\n\nHe explained: “Even I will wallow. Let’s say there’s a politician I don’t like, and there’s some article online criticizing him a little bit. I’m like, ‘Oh, that’s such a good critique, [and] I enjoyed reading it, even if it was exaggerated.’”\n\nGates’ probing questions about how to control the spread of incorrect information online may be at odds with the take of fellow billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nGates said in the interview: “We should have free speech. But if you’re inciting violence, if you’re causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries? Even the U.S. should have rules, and then if you have rules, what is it? Is it some AI that encodes those rules? You have billions in activity, and if you catch it a day later the harm is done.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Gates has proposed the emerging technology as a tool against misinformation and deepfakes (images and videos which are incredibly realistic but are not authentic).\n\nIn a blog post on his website, GatesNotes, in July 2023, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation cofounder wrote: “This will be a cyclical process: Someone finds a way to detect fakery, someone else figures out how to counter it, someone else develops counter-countermeasures, and so on.\n\n“It won’t be a perfect success, but we won’t be helpless either.”\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X—the platform previously known as Twitter—is a free-speech absolutist who is unlikely to appreciate the notion of rules being placed on what he, or others, can say.\n\nMusk believes freedom of speech is the “bedrock of democracy” and has vowed to battle apparent censorship of his platform.\n\nThat being said, a debate over how to control misinformation wouldn’t be the first time the views of Musk and Gates have been at odds. In July 2024, for example, Musk threatened Gates would be “obliterated” for apparently holding a bearish position on Tesla stock. Fortune could not confirm whether Gates still owns a short position on the EV maker.\n\nLikewise, Gates has said his management style is better than that of Musk—a boss he believes may push “too hard.” Meanwhile, Musk has claimed Gates doesn’t understand artificial intelligence, saying his insight on the topic is “limited.”\n\nMore recently, the tech titans have been at loggerheads over Musk’s work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE.) In January 2025, Gates said he hoped some of the foreign aid and personnel cuts enacted by DOGE would be rolled back: “Elon I think said ‘Yeah, we made a mistake, we went overboard,’ but … what is the equilibrium? How many of those people can be kept so we can continue to save tens of millions of lives?” Gates also accused Musk of some “insane” political interference in 2025.\n\nIn November, Musk revived the bad blood between the pair, writing on X that if Gates hadn’t closed out his alleged “crazy short position” against Tesla, “he had better do so soon.”\n\nIt seems misinformation may just be another of many topics on which the billionaires will have to agree to disagree.\n\nA version of this article was first published on September 5, 2024.",

    "description": "The State Department is now reviewing the social media of some visa applicants, causing delays in processing for some foreign workers.",
    "fullText": "The United States is reviewing the social media accounts of some visa applicants, adding another hurdle for workers and other visitors to clear under the Trump administration.\n\nIt's also adding a hurdle for embassies processing those visa applications.\n\nThe State Department said in June that certain visa applicants would have their online activity vetted as part of its screening process. Six months later, the department expanded the list of visas that were subject to \"online presence reviews.\"\n\nThe new rule has complicated the visa application process, causing significant delays for approvals.\n\nThey have also rattled some companies, including Google and Apple, whose legal counsels have advised staffers requiring a visa stamp to re-enter the US not to leave the country due to extended processing times resulting from the new requirements.\n\nConsular offices began conducting online presence reviews for H-1B applicants on December 15, but they're not the only ones affected.\n\nEarlier this month, a State Department spokesperson told Business Insider that the US is requiring H-1B visa applicants and their dependents to make their social media accounts public so consular officers can review their activity.\n\nThe H-1B visa program enables companies to temporarily employ foreign skilled workers in specialized roles. Data collected from the Department of Labor showed that almost 50% of H-1B applications are in \"professional, scientific, and technical\" fields. They are commonly relied on in the tech industry.\n\nThe State Department said international students and exchange visitors are also subject to \"online presence\" reviews, specifically for F, M, and J non-immigrant visa applicants.\n\nIn its memo, Google's legal counsel told staffers that lengthy processing delays were affecting H-1B, H-4, F, J, and M visa holders.\n\nFederal agencies under President Donald Trump are enforcing stricter and more restrictive immigration policies.\n\nIn January, Trump issued an executive order aimed at enhancing immigration screening. It was meant to protect American citizens from those the administration says \"intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\"\n\nTrump expanded upon that executive order in June and then again this week. Combined, those subsequent orders partially or fully restrict entry for citizens from 25 countries.\n\nIn September, the Trump administration also began charging a $100,000 fee for new H-1B applications.\n\nIt cast the fee as a corrective. Trump said that the H-1B system had strayed from its original purpose of filling high-skilled worker shortages and was instead being \"deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\"\n\nIn its announcement about the social media checks on December 3, the State Department said the changes were meant to increase national security.\n\n\"A US visa is a privilege, not a right,\" a spokesperson for the State Department told Business Insider at the time. \"In every visa case, we will take the time necessary to ensure an applicant does not pose a risk to the safety and security of the United States.\"\n\nIt might be tempting to delete your social media accounts, but it's not that simple.\n\nThe law firm Davis Wright Tremaine advised in a post on its website that visa applicants should review their social media to ensure there is no information that might contradict the details submitted in their applications. The law firm Duane Morris advised against deleting posts or profiles. If an immigration official notices, it could be seen as evasive.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing a visa applicant can do is stay in the US during the process.\n\nShaun Foster, an immigration attorney who owns the firm PampaninFoster based in Cambridge, Mass., told Business Insider in a LinkedIn message that he is encouraging clients on H-1B visas to play it safe.\n\n\"We've continued to emphasize generally to stay in the US, and to keep moving forward in working toward your immigration goals from within the US,\" he wrote. \"We're much better positioned, as immigration counsel, to more strongly assist and guide people from within the US. There's less control when you start integrating international consular elements.\"\n\nLawyers for Google and Apple have already advised some employees on visas not to travel outside the US due to delays at embassies stemming from the increased scrutiny.\n\n\"Please be aware that some US Embassies and Consulates are experiencing significant visa stamping appointment delays, currently reported as up to 12 months,\" Google's legal counsel wrote in a memo sent on Thursday to employees on visas.\n\nFragomen, a law firm that represents Apple, similarly said in a memo sent last week to some visa holders at the company that they should refrain from travel.\n\n\"Given the recent updates and the possibility of unpredictable, extended delays when returning to the US, we strongly recommend that employees without a valid H-1B visa stamp avoid international travel for now,\" the memo said.\n\nBoth memos were seen by Business Insider.\n\nThose companies and many others are still smarting after Trump imposed the $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applicants in September.\n\nAfter that order, which initially didn't specify that it only applied to new applicants, human resources teams at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Salesforce, JPMorgan, and Zoom sent warnings to staffers advising them not to leave the US if they're on an H-1B visa.\n\nIn one case, dozens of H-1B holders on an Emirates flight out of San Francisco began deplaning as soon as they received the news alert.\n\nThe widespread panic in corporate America forced the Trump administration to clarify that the fee would only apply to new visa applicants, not existing visa holders.",

    "description": "I pushed myself so hard to make the holidays special when my kids were little. Now they are adults, and they are so much better.",
    "fullText": "My daughter-in-law called me recently to ask about Secret Santa. She was wondering if everyone would get involved, if I had any thoughts on stocking stuffers, and if there was anything in particular I might want, other than the Costco-sized jar of peanut M&Ms I had mentioned about 1,000 times.\n\nMy youngest son texted not long after to let me know he got three full days off for Christmas. He'll be bringing his cat for a visit. We'll all buy him cat treats. We will prepare casseroles and cookies, as well as overnight cinnamon rolls for the morning. We will wait to watch the main event, the Christmas movies, until we are all together.\n\nThis is my Christmas with adult kids. The kind of Christmas I dreaded when my four sons were little and I thought I had just those magical 18 holidays with them before it would all end.\n\nI thought those Christmases were the best I would ever see as a mom because I think that's the story we are sold. Christmas is for kids. It's better with kids. It's more fun, more magical, more everything. And I'll tell you that I really wrung every second of joy out of Christmas when my kids were little in an absolute panic of memory-making.\n\nI pushed the Santa agenda far longer than was socially acceptable. I baked every day, built gingerbread houses, and attended every Christmas concert. I bought the matching pajamas, I collected special ornaments and kept them in boxes for the boys to hang on our tree every year, no matter what.\n\nI think I idolized the holidays, like a good Christmas might make up for any other shortcomings during the rest of the year. I overlooked how tough it really was on me in favor of the good mom checkmark I might get at the end of it all.\n\nAnd it was hard on me. I can admit this finally. Not just because I was on my own with my sons or because we were living right around the poverty line. But because I genuinely believed that the only Christmases that mattered happened when my kids were little. It was like a Doomsday clock was ticking down on my every year, tied up with a neat red bow. I had to build memories for them at any cost so they would have happy childhood memories and not look back on our life together as a failure.\n\nI wish I could go back and talk to the stressed-out mom I was then. I would tell her that she could stop spending important January bill money on December toys. I would tell her that her kids will be OK. And yes, they want a few toys, but they will remember about one quarter of them by the next year.\n\nMost of all, I would tell her that she has way more fun holidays ahead than she thinks. I would even argue that Christmas with adult kids is better than it is with little kids. The pressure is off. Right or wrong, they are grown now. I don't have to keep any kind of special magic alive for them; they've seen behind the curtain, and they know I was back there all along.\n\nThey see me. They appreciate me. Best of all, they are back behind the curtain with me now, too. They provide, along with me, trips to the grocery store for forgotten spices, coffee cream, and extra napkins. They buy gifts and tell me not to worry about anything. They lighten my load. I'm no longer the keeper of Christmas; we all are. Bringing a different kind of magic to whatever days we might have together over the holidays.\n\nWe bring in the old traditions from when they were kids, but also leave the door open for new things. New recipes, new ideas on how to celebrate. Chinese takeout for Christmas Eve one year or homemade pizza, depending on everyone's work schedule. A little Baileys in our coffee while we open stockings. All of us together. The five of us, along with new partners, are perhaps the best Christmas gift of all. New family members who bring their own family traditions. We stay up late, we play cards with fun playlists full of music that's new to me. I sleep happily.\n\nI miss my boys being little. I always will. But these men and their partners and our holidays together? This feels like the real reward.",

    "fullText": "The Justice Department's long-awaited release of the Epstein files on Friday offered a deeper look at the jet-setting lifestyle of the late sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein — but few major revelations.\n\nThe data dump included thousands of files, mostly images, many of which were heavily redacted. The Justice Department released the documents to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law last month.\n\nThe department, citing the task of ensuring no information included in the release could be used to identify victims, did not make public its entire database on Friday, as the law required. The department said it would turn over more files in the coming weeks.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. Nine years later, the financier was charged with the sex trafficking of minors. He died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody.\n\nBusiness Insider has been reviewing the latest files, which continued to roll out late Friday evening. Here are our biggest takeaways.\n\nThe files contained numerous images of celebrities and politicians, including former president Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson, and British billionaire Richard Branson.\n\nThe photos are not evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nNot all of the celebs were pictured with Epstein, and at least one photo — of Diana Ross with Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson — can be found on the professional photography service, Getty Images, suggesting it was not Epstein's personal photo.\n\nThe context of many of the photos is also unclear, lacking dates, locations, and other identifying information.\n\nClinton featured prominently in the latest round of files, including several previously unseen photos.\n\nAngel Ureña, a spokesperson for Clinton, said on X that the former president was unaware of Epstein's criminal activity.\n\n\"There are two types of people here,\" he wrote. \"The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.\"\n\nOther famous figures seen in photos in the documents include actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, The Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger, and Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York. Business Insider reached out to them for comment.\n\nSpacey had earlier called for the release of the Epstein files and said in a post on X in July that he has \"nothing to fear.\" In multiple interviews before the latest release, Tucker has denied any knowledge of criminal activity. Jagger has not responded publicly. Ferguson has said she cut ties with Epstein after his conviction.\n\nThe Justice Department's release drew criticism from some victims and Democrats for its heavy redactions and limited initial release.\n\nIn some cases, entire documents were obscured by black boxes, including one 119-page file. The DOJ has attributed its delay in producing all the documents by the December 19 deadline in part to its duty to safeguard the personal information of victims and other individuals.\n\nThe files shed some light on how long young women have been accusing Epstein of wrongdoing.\n\nAmong the thousands of documents was a 1996 FBI memo included in a complaint filed against Epstein by a woman whose name the Justice Department redacted. Business Insider confirmed the accuser was Maria Farmer, who has previously said publicly that she reported Epstein to the authorities.\n\nIn her original complaint, Farmer says Epstein stole pictures of her 16-year-old sister and is \"believed to have sold them to potential buyers.\" She says he once asked someone to take photos of young women at swimming pools.\n\n\"I feel redeemed. This is one of the best days of my life,\" Farmer said in a statement to Business Insider shared by her lawyer.\n\nThe Justice Department was required by law to release the documents by December 19, but US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday that the files would be released in batches over the coming weeks. Four sets of files were released on Friday evening. The Justice Department posted an additional three sets late Friday, which included photos of evidence files.\n\nThe Justice Department's delay in releasing all the files at once has led to criticism from lawmakers. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie said the move \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna told CNN that he and Massie were now drafting articles of impeachment against US Attorney General Pam Bondi following the release.\n\nTrump is known to have socialized with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, and photos of the pair together have been well publicized in recent years.\n\nHe didn't feature prominently in Friday's document release. There was a photo of a messy desk that contained a photo of Trump inside a drawer. Trump has previously said he ended his ties with Epstein years ago.\n\nBlanche told ABC News on Friday that there had been \"no effort to hold anything back because there is the name Donald J Trump.\"\n\nTrump had not commented publicly on the files as of Saturday afternoon.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Burrows, Hope 2, Rosser, penalty, Dyer Cons: O'Brien 5 Pens: O'Brien 2\n\nTries: Gilbert, Prendergast 2 Cons: Gilbert 3\n\nDragons climbed off the bottom of the United Rugby Championship (URC) with a remarkable 48-28 victory against Connacht that ended a 15-month league winless streak.\n\nThe Rodney Parade club backed up their European Challenge Cup success against Lyon to win successive games for the first time since October 2022.\n\nHooker Oli Burrows, scrum-half Che Hope and wing Jared Rosser went over before a penalty try earned a 28-7 half-time lead.\n\nShell-shocked Connacht, who opened the scoring through full-back Sam Gilbert, were taken out of the contest at an increasingly raucous Rodney Parade by a pair of Angus O'Brien penalties.\n\nThe wheels had come off for the Irish province against their slick hosts, with wing Rio Dyer finishing superbly and then setting up Hope for a second.\n\nFlanker Cian Prendergast went over for a double to ensure Connacht were chasing an undeserved consolation bonus at the death and they got it with the clock in the red through Sean Jansen.\n\nStuart Lancaster's side have taken at least a point from every game this season but the scoreline flattered them in Newport.\n\nMunster rise to second in URC win against Ospreys\n\nPeel celebrates family wedding with win in Cardiff\n\nClovers defeat Gwalia in Celtic Challenge opener\n\nDragons recorded their first URC win since beating Ospreys on the opening weekend of 2024-25 while it was their first five-point haul in the league since the Judgement Day success against Scarlets in April 2023.\n\nAt one stage they were threatening to beat their 48-0 victory against Borders in 2007 - their biggest league winning margin.\n\nFilo Tiatia's men now go in search of ending their most embarrassing streak – the 20-game losing run against fierce rivals Cardiff that stretches back to the Challenge Cup quarter-final win in April 2015.\n\nThey make the short trip to the Arms Park on 26 December (15:00 GMT) before hosting Scarlets on New Year's Day.\n\nDragons do so buoyed by one of their finest performances in recent times, arguably the best since Munster were stunned in the first game of the Dai Flanagan era in 2022, and with welcome selection headaches.\n\nThere were plenty of huge performances with number eight Harrison Keddie, resurgent wing Dyer, influential centre Aneurin Owen, blind-side flanker Ryan Woodman, scrum-half Hope and full-back O'Brien – all homegrown players – having strong arguments for man of the match.\n\nIt was Dyer that got the official honour.\n\nConnacht hit the front in the 10th minute when direct running on the line was followed by fly-half Josh Ioane putting Gilbert over with a pop pass, the full-back adding the routine extras himself.\n\nDragons, who did not risk talisman Aaron Wainwright ahead of their festive derbies because the Wales number eight had a niggle, responded impressively to lead 14-7 after 26 minutes.\n\nPressure in the 22 led to hooker Burrows smashing over from a quick tap and then the hosts profited from some good fortune for Hope to race over after gathering the loose ball from a botched line-out.\n\nFull-back Angus O'Brien converted both scores and then provided the final pass to Rosser to put the buoyant Dragons over for their third try in the 32nd minute.\n\nA 21-7 lead represented a good half for the hosts but it got even better after Connacht opted to keep playing inside their own territory with the clock in the red.\n\nCentre Fine Inisi intercepted a pass, Dragons won a penalty and kicked for the corner to get their driving lineout moving.\n\nConnacht number eight Paul Boyle slipped and the maul was prevented from going over the line by his body; accidental but still resulting in a penalty try and a yellow card.\n\nBonus point secure, Dragons maturely stretched their lead to 34-7 with a pair of O'Brien penalties soon after the restart.\n\nThey kept the foot down and a fifth try followed when Dyer raced around scrum-half Ben Murphy in the 22.\n\nDragons flanker Thomas Young was denied a sixth shortly after coming on by a forward pass but Dyer turned provider on the hour by sprinting down the left and then keeping his cool to put Hope over.\n\nConnacht went hunting a consolation try bonus with seven minutes to play and found it thanks to a brace by flanker Prendergast.\n\nPressure at the death was rewarded by replacement back-row forward Sean Jansen crashing over.\n\nConnacht will end 2025 with just one away success in the URC – a victory against Zebre in Parma in May.\n\nStuart Lancaster's side will feel they should have won on two previous visits to Wales this season, at Cardiff in round three and when they blew a commanding lead at Ospreys in the Challenge Cup.\n\nHowever, they were comprehensively outplayed by Dragons and are now under pressure for a home fixture against Ulster on 27 December (17:30 GMT) and a 3 January trip to Dublin to face Leinster (17:30 GMT).\n\nConnacht will hope this humiliation sparks a reaction.\n\nDragons: O'Brien; J Rosser, Inisi, Owen, Dyer; De Beer, Hope; Martinez, Burrows, Hunt, Douglas, Carter (capt), Woodman, Beddall, Keddie.\n\nReplacements: G Roberts, Morris, Dlamini, Lewis-Hughes, Young, R Williams, Westwood, Anderson.\n\nConnacht: Gilbert;

There will be one in Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west, which could result in a survival fight between Swansea-based Ospreys and Scarlets in Llanelli.\n\nAfter temporarily going into administration in April, Cardiff were taken over by the WRU with the governing body expecting to sell the organisation to fresh investors in the new year.\n\nOspreys' owners, Y11 Sport & Media, have been linked with taking over Cardiff, which is another way the WRU could get its wish of losing a men's professional side.\n\nOspreys, or the club's owners, have not commented about the Cardiff rumours, fuelling concern among supporters surrounding the future of their side.\n\nOn the field, Ospreys will have to try to remain focussed as they travel to face Scarlets in the west Wales derby on 26 December, while Munster host Leinster a day later.\n\nOspreys: Nagy; Kasende, Boshoff, Watkin, Giles; Edwards, Morgan-Williams: S Thomas, Lake (capt), Henry, R Davies, Smith, Ratti, Deaves, M Morris.\n\nReplacements: Parry, C Jones, Botha, Sutton, Morse, Hardy, K Williams, Walsh.\n\nMunster: Haley; Nash, T Farrell, Nankivell, Daly; Crowley, Patterson; Loughman, Scannell, Ala'alatoa, Kleyn, Wycherley, O'Donoghue (capt), Kendellen, Coombes.\n\nReplacements: Barron, Milne, Bartley, Edogbo, Ahern, Coughlan, Hanrahan, Hodnett.\n\nAssistant referees: Craig Evans & Andrew Moule (WRU)",

    "fullText": "Tries: Isgro, Smith Cons: Smith 2\n\nTries: Ravouvou, Batley, Oghre, Rees-Zammit, Grondona, Genge Cons: Jordan 4, Williams\n\nBristol produced a scintillating attacking display to hammer Harlequins 40-14 under the lights at Twickenham Stadium.\n\nIn Quins' annual 'Big Game', it was the Bears who came out on top as they ran in six tries and won by 26 points.\n\nUnanswered scores from Kalaveti Ravouvou, Joe Batley, Gabriel Oghre and Louis Rees-Zammit gave the visitors a ruthless 26-0 lead at the break against a Harlequins side that had at times produced some good rugby themselves.\n\nSantiago Grondona added another before Quins finally got on the board through Rodrigo Isgro, when the Bears were down to 14 with Tom Jordan in the sin-bin.\n\nEngland prop Ellis Genge then scored a stunning 50-metre try before his Red Rose teammate scored a consolation for Quins, as the Bears styled out a stunning win at the national stadium.\n\nAfter Harlequins had run out 38-12 winners in the Prem Women's Rugby fixture earlier in the afternoon, the men's teams took to the field to a stunning show of lights and fireworks.\n\nAnd it was Bristol who provided the bright spark right from the early stages as they hit their hosts hard.\n\nEverything Quins put together, the Bears defence was equal to it and the visitors took a firm grip on the match through four devastating attacks.\n\nFirst, Ravouvou dotted down in the corner after a lovely-weighted pass from Tom Jordan, before Batley rounded of a flowing move involving Jordan, Ravouvou and Benhard Janse van Rensburg.\n\nOghre darted through to score his side's third before Rees-Zammit got the try of the half, collecting the ball before sprinting downfield, chipping up and over full-back Nick David and diving over the line as Harlequins went in at the break with zero on the scoreboard.\n\nAnd the hosts were reduced to 14 players inside three minutes of the restart as Jack Walker was sent to the sin-bin for offside on his own try-line, with Grondona running through for what felt like an inevitable fifth try.\n\nQuins were given a lifeline just before the hour when Jordan was shown a yellow card and the home side finally gave the large Twickenham crowd something to cheers as substitute Isgro eventually dived over to get his side on the board.\n\nEngland prop Genge, who had been replaced but reintroduced because of injury, took the ball from a lineout and sprinted 50 metres to score a stunning try.\n\nHarlequins' luck was summed up when Sam Riley scored but play was brought back after replays showed Isgro's foot had touched the line.\n\nSmith ran through to score, and convert, his side's second try soon after, which would ultimately prove to be a consolation as Bristol secured a memorable victory in London.\n\nHarlequins head coach Jason Gilmore:\n\n\"It is very disappointing. We were not in the contest for 40 minutes and just could not get a foothold in it. All the guys were excited about playing another Big Game at this stadium, but we started poorly.\n\n\"The half-time talk was about rolling our sleeves up and having a go. And we showed some commitment.\n\n\"We did that in the second half, but you shouldn't have to wait to half-time to roll your sleeves up and fight.\n\n\"I thought we were in a pretty good spot going into the contest, but things just didn't go to plan at all.\"\n\n\"I was pleased with the whole team. We set about it in the right, positive manner and had the game under control by half-time.\n\n\"It's a nice way to start the Prem games again and puts us right near the top. We now need to build on it.\"\n\n(On Louis Rees-Zammit) \"Louis has fitted in really well after returning from his NFL spell in the States.\n\n\"He's an outstanding lad who can switch from wing to full-back, where he played tonight. He can do special things and that's what he did here with his try.\"\n\nHarlequins: David; Cleaves, Beard, Northmore, Murley; Smith, Porter; Baxter, Walker, Williams, Petti, Treadwell, Carr, Kenningham, Cunningham-South\n\nReplacements: Riley, Hobson, Delgado, Launchbury, Evans, Friday, Waghorn, Isgro\n\nBristol: Rees-Zammit; Boshoff, BJ van Rensburg, Williams, Ravouvou; Jordan, Marmion; Genge, Oghre, Chawatama, Rubiolo, Batley, Owen, S Grondona, Harding\n\nReplacements: Thacker, Woolmore, Kloska, Taylor, B Grondona, Randall, Worsley, Heward\n\nSin-bin: Jordan [57], Williams [71]",

    "description": "Liverpool stretch their unbeaten run to six games but Alexander Isak's injury while scoring overshadows win at Tottenham.",
    "fullText": "It was meant to be the moment that finally kick-started the season for Alexander Isak.\n\nLiverpool's £125m signing had come off the bench and finished wonderfully past Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario to give Arne Slot's side the lead.\n\nOn the touchline, Slot was ecstatic after seeing Isak combine with Florian Wirtz, who got his first Premier League assist after signing for £116m in the summer.\n\nWith Mohamed Salah in Morocco on Africa Cup of Nations duty and Cody Gakpo out with injury, here was a glimpse of Liverpool's future. And the first sign of a connection between Liverpool's two record signings.\n\nYet within seconds, that joy turned to concern as Isak lay on the floor in agony after Micky van de Ven's tackle. As his team-mates gathered around him, it became clear that Isak would be unable to continue.\n\n\"We'll have to wait and see,\" said Slot. \"But if a player scores and then gets injured and doesn't try to come back on the pitch, that's usually not a good thing.\"\n\nFor Liverpool, who have seemingly turned a corner and are now unbeaten in six, the problems continue to mount though with Isak and Conor Bradley both facing a spell on the sidelines.\n\nTo sum up their misfortune in a nutshell, Bradley was taken off at half-time after a knock for Isak. On the hour mark, Isak came off for Jeremie Frimpong, who was playing his first game since October.\n\nFrimpong then failed to finish the game as he was replaced by Federico Chiesa in the 90th minute, though Slot insisted that the full-back would be fine and that he simply didn't want to take the risk of playing for 30 seconds with 10 men. Either way, two players that Slot subbed on failed to finish the game.\n\nIn the end, Hugo Ekitike's goal ensured Liverpool held on to yet another crucial victory but they almost blew it against the nine men of Tottenham, who had both Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero sent off.\n\n\"A masterclass on how not to manage the final 10 minutes\" was the verdict of Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports. Slot himself admitted that it was far from ideal.\n\n\"It's unbelievable if you play against nine men that I would not be surprised if for the nine minutes of added time, they had the ball for eight and a half. That is not what you expect and maybe that tells you where we are in this season,\" Slot told BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"We need a few more wins to get a bit more comfortable with setbacks. The thing that keeps in your mind is the last 10 minutes, but there was a lot more to like in the first 80 to 90 minutes.\"",

    "description": "As we approach the halfway point of the season, what do the ghosts of Christmas past tell us about the Premier League title race and relegation battle?",
    "fullText": "Arsenal will spend Christmas Day on top of the Premier League tree this year, while Wolves, Burnley and West Ham are hanging precariously on the bottom branches.\n\nAs we approach the halfway point of the season, what do the ghosts of Christmas past tell us about the title race and relegation battle?\n\nThe team that is top of the Premier League on Christmas Day has gone on to win the title in 17 of the previous 33 seasons – basically a flip of a chocolate coin.\n\nHowever, Arsenal themselves have a much bleaker record as they've been top at Christmas four times before but have never gone on to lift the trophy.\n\nThe Gunners had only been top at this stage twice before Mikel Arteta took charge, but this is the third time in four seasons that they sit top of the tree at Christmas.\n\nTheir fans will hope that the wisdom Arteta's men have received in seasons past will see them finally hold off Manchester City and deliver the gift they've been wishing for since 2004.\n\n\"You'd like to think that through all the experiences that Arsenal have had being top at Christmas, they can understand the mistakes made in the back half of some seasons that stopped them from winning the title,\" former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha told Football Focus.\n\nThere isn't a lot of room for error though as Arsenal have a slender lead of just two points, while the average lead by the team top on Christmas Day is four points.\n\nIn fact, the only table-toppers at Christmas to have a smaller lead than Arsenal in the last 12 seasons were the Gunners themselves two years ago.\n\nBut while a two-point lead isn't much, history suggests it might be enough.\n\nArsenal are the eighth side in Premier League history to have a two-point lead at Christmas and five of the previous seven went on to win the title, including the last four.\n\nBizarrely Arsenal are the only side to win the Premier League without ever doing it when they were top at Christmas, as all three of their titles came when chasing the leaders at this time of year.\n\nThey were sixth and an incredible 13 points behind leaders Man Utd in 1997-98, second and three points behind Newcastle in 2001-02 and third and one point behind Man Utd at Christmas time in 2003-04.\n\nThat 13-point deficit in 1997-98 is the most points a team has ever been behind the leaders at Christmas and won the title (Arsenal did have a game in hand), while the lowest the eventual champions have been in the table at this stage is eighth, by Manchester City in the Covid-delayed season of 2020-21.\n\nWeirdly the team in second on Christmas Day has gone on to win the title in only two of the past 17 seasons, although both times it was Manchester City who did so.\n\nIn fact, in the last five seasons where the leaders at Christmas did not go on to win the title, the Premier League was won each time by Manchester City.\n\nFor many Arsenal fans, there will be a sense of deja vu. Leading the Premier League at Christmas before being eaten up by a relentless Pep Guardiola side is something the Gunners have got a little bit used to.\n\nSeeing a seven-point lead over Manchester City cut to two in the space of five games won't exactly fill them with confidence either.\n\n\"We're back on top of the table but we're not watching City too much, or the other teams,\" said Bukayo Saka. \"We're in control now. We know if we win every week we'll stay there.\"\n\nArteta added: \"The only thing we can control is our own performance and results and we know how long it's going to be and how tough is this league. That's it.\"\n\nManchester City have obviously got history on their side. Guardiola has won the Premier League title six times, the Bundesliga three times with Bayern Munich and La Liga three times with Barcelona. Arteta has no league titles as a manager.\n\nGuardiola's squad are full of Premier League winners, players who know what it takes to end a campaign strong, while none of the Arsenal squad have won a Premier League – but have experienced losing leads over the past few seasons.\n\nWhy can't this season be different though? Manchester City look far from the relentless side they have in previous seasons – and have already lost four games this campaign, compared to Arsenal's two losses.\n\n\"We will be there. If they follow me we will be there but we have to improve,\" said Guardiola.\n\n\"I know the level in Europe, in the Premier League, I know Arsenal and the other teams and how tough they are. It is not enough.\n\n\"The spirit is there, last season we did not have the spirit or aggression or hunger - all the attributes they need. It is not about the highlights and how good the actions are, there is something that comes from inside where we will recover from the Club World Cup.\"\n\nCity's attack is flowing, having scored 10 more goals than Arsenal, but having also conceded six more – you feel the title race could be defined by whether City's goals can outshine Arsenal's solidity.\n\nOnly four times in 33 Premier League seasons has the side bottom on Christmas Day survived, with the most recent being Wolves in 2022-23.\n\nBut with just two points won and a record 16 points from safety, it would take not just a Christmas miracle but a New Year's, Valentine's and Easter one too for bottom side Wolves to survive once again.\n\nSecond-bottom Burnley have a fighting chance as almost half the teams in their position at Christmas have stayed up, although the only time that's happened in the past eight seasons was when Eddie Howe led Newcastle to 11th in 2021-22.\n\nWest Ham fans have the most reason to be optimistic as the team in 18th has survived in two out of three seasons on average, most recently Nottingham Forest in 2022-23 and Wolves last time out.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that one of West Ham, Burnley and Wolves will stay up as that's happened just over half the time, with two teams surviving in 12 of the previous 33 seasons.\n\nThe three teams bottom at Christmas have never all survived while only four times in Premier League history have all three been relegated, although two of those occurred recently in 2020-21 and 2023-24.\n\nIn terms of who could be relegated in their place, the team flying highest at Christmas that ultimately went down were Norwich in 1994-95, who were seventh with 30 points and 11 points above the drop.\n\nThat was in a 42-game season though. In a 38-game campaign, the best team on Christmas Day to be relegated were Blackpool in 2010-11, who were 10th with 22 points but finished 19th with 39 points.\n\nNewcastle in 2008-09 were 12th with 22 points and went down, while the most points a relegated side has been above the bottom three at Christmas is seven by Reading in 2007-08, who were 12th with 21 points.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",
