    "fullText": "Braves reportedly attempting to outbid Mets, Phillies, Padres for $38M All-Star amid injury news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are in a tough spot when it comes to starting pitching, just one year removed from battling the injury bug throughout the entire season. The most recent blow to the rotation came Sunday, when the Braves announced that Hurston Waldrep is undergoing testing due to arm discomfort.\n\n“The Atlanta Braves' rotation took another hit Sunday when manager Walt Weiss said right-hander Hurston Waldrep may need surgery to remove \"loose bodies\" found in his arm. Waldrep complained of discomfort after throwing batting practice. Weiss said an MRI showed no ligament damage, but the team is waiting to learn more after Waldrep has additional tests,” ESPN wrote.\n\nThe injury concerns began on the first day of Spring Training, when Spencer Schwellenbach announced he would start the season on the 60-day injured list. It was not the start anyone in the Braves organization was hoping for.\n\n“The Braves opened camp this morning with an unwelcome update on talented young righty Spencer Schwellenbach. He’s been placed on the 60-day injured list due to inflammation in his right elbow, per Mark Bowman of MLB.com. The team’s hope is that the 25-year-old is dealing with bone spurs and not something more nefarious,” MLB Trade Rumors’ Steve Adams wrote.\n\nWith these injuries already piling up, the Braves are now trying to make one last push for Lucas Giolito, one of the final remaining starters in free agency.\n\n“Per league sources, Lucas Giolito’s market is gaining momentum toward a deal, likely this week. Atlanta and San Diego Padres have intensified their pursuit and moved to the forefront of discussions. The Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets have also remained in contact dating back to the Winter Meetings,” MLB reporter Julian Scott wrote.\n\nThe Braves appear to be going all-in on Giolito following the recent injury news involving Schwellenbach and Waldrep. Atlanta needs to land a starting pitcher who is at least somewhat appealing on the current market.\n\nTension is already building in Atlanta. If a move isn’t made quickly, the season could be in jeopardy before it even begins. And if the Braves continue to strike out, they may be forced to roll with what they have until the season progresses.",

    "fullText": "Heat’s Norman Powell recalls his disbelief over first moment with DeMar DeRozan appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nMiami Heat guard Norman Powell completed another personal milestone after playing in his first-ever All-Star Game on Sunday.\n\nHe suited up for Team World in the mini-tournament, losing both of their assignments in the round robin and failing to advance to the final. In two games, Powell, who has Jamaican heritage, went scoreless against Team Stars before contributing five points, two rebounds, and one assist versus Team Stripes.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, it was a memorable evening for Powell, who is enjoying a breakout campaign with the Heat. He has truly come a long way, starting as a bench player for the Toronto Raptors in 2015.\n\nThe 32-year-old shooter even recalled being in disbelief over working out with then-Raptors star DeMar DeRozan for the first time at UCLA after being drafted.\n\n“Just because being a So Cal (Southern California) kid, knowing everything DeMar did at Compton, watching his highlight videos when I was in high school, so sharing a court with him, working out with him, playing one-on-one, it was one of those moments,” said Powell in a video posted by The Score.\n\n“After we were done, I called my boys, like, ‘Yeah, I just got a workout with DeMar, I just scored on him.’ So that’s probably my first moment of ‘Man, I can’t believe it.'”\n\nNorman Powell couldn't believe he got to work out with DeMar DeRozan before he was drafted: \"I called my boys after like 'I just got a work out in with DeMar and I scored on him.\" ❤️\n\nPresented by @TangerineBank pic.twitter.com/mR2sN5RkSF\n\n— theScore (@theScore) February 15, 2026\n\nPowell lived out his childhood dream, being teammates with DeRozan for four years before the latter was traded to the San Antonio Spurs, along with Jakob Poeltl and a first-round pick, in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.\n\nWhile Powell was sad to see his idol go, Leonard led the Raptors to the championship in 2019.\n\nNow that he and DeRozan, who is now with the Sacramento Kings, are at different stages of their careers, it is great to hear Powell looking back at his humble beginnings.",

    "title": "Padres players want A.J. Preller in San Diego, he wants to be there, too",
    "description": "GM is used to giving out contracts, but now he is looking for one of his own.",
    "fullText": "Speculation about a contract extension for San Diego Padres President of Baseball Operations and General Manager A.J. Preller has been persistent this offseason. Multiple reports have stated that a deal between Preller and the Padres would be forthcoming but to this point nothing is done as of the team’s first full squad workout of Spring Training, Sunday.\n\nPreller is entering the final year of his contract, making him a “lame duck” general manager. Questions about his future with the organization are to be expected but so far remain unanswered. Padres CEO Erik Greupner spoke with Ben Higgins and Steven Woods of “Ben and Woods” on 97.3 The Fan in October of 2025 about an extension for Preller.\n\n“It’s always been the plan that the discussions around an extension for A.J. would take place at the beginning of the offseason as part of our review and evaluation,” Greupner said. “So those discussions have begun and we’re optimistic that A.J. will be our president of baseball operations past 2026.”\n\nNow that February has arrived, Spring Training has begun and Preller still does not have a contract extension, the questions about his future with the team are becoming more prevalent and players are being asked for their thoughts on the situation. Manny Machado, who Preller brought to San Diego as a free agent in 2019, praised Preller and the work he has done with the Padres, adding his lack of an extension is “weird.”\n\n“Yeah, it’s kind of weird,” Machado said. “They’ve been saying they’ve been working on it. Obviously, there’s a lot going on right now with the organization, but I think they’ll figure it out. At the end of the day, we all know the value of A.J. in this organization.”\n\nIt certainly cannot hurt Preller’s case for an extension if one of the locker room leaders who is connected to the team for the foreseeable future speaks on his behalf. To Preller’s credit, according to a social media post from Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union Tribune, when Preller was asked about Machado’s comments he said, “You give out a $300 million contract, usually you get those kinds of comments.”\n\nPreller had the backing of another prominent player well before the media scrums on Sunday. Michael King who re-signed with the Padres in the offseason after testing the free agent market credited Preller for his desire to return to San Diego.\n\n“I’d say the main reason I signed back here was because of Preller,” King said at Padres FanFest in January. “Knowing him as a GM, I know he is going to put a winning team out there every time I’m a part of this contract. I wanted to win throughout the duration of it, and I have the trust in him to do that.”\n\nMachado had similar sentiments to King about Preller and his ability to put together a roster, and for good reason. Preller has been the architect of the most successful run in franchise history, which has included trips to the playoffs in four of the last six seasons.\n\n“We do what we can with the team and he does his best,” Machado said. “Obviously, it’s been successful the last two years with what we’ve had to navigate. This year is nothing different.\n\n“He’s made three moves (Saturday) in a matter of 24 hours and made our team drastically better and he’s going to continue to do that,” Machado added.\n\nPreller has been one of the most active and aggressive general managers in baseball during his time in San Diego. He has shown a willingness to trade from the roster and the minor league system to acquire current players like Fernando Tatis Jr., Joe Musgrove, Yu Darvish, Jason Adam, Jake Cronenworth and more recently Mason Miller. He traded for players who have left the organization like Blake Snell, Juan Soto, Josh Hader, Dylan Cease and Luis Arraez. Not all the trades have gone in favor of San Diego, but each one has kept the Padres in the discussion of a team competing for a World Series championship.\n\n“I think we all know that and we all have faith in him and know that he’s gonna want the best for this organization, the best for this team and he’s gonna try to put the best team out there to go out there and give us the best opportunity to win a championship,” Machado said Sunday.\n\nPreller has also spent money, and this is an area where the part of the fanbase that was not upset about trading away prospects and potential, tends to stand up and make its voice heard. Preller initially signed Machado and then extended him for 11 years at $350 million, keeping him with the team until 2033. Preller extended Tatis Jr. on a 14-year $340 million deal in 2021 and Cronenworth on a seven-year, $80 million deal in April of 2023. Preller extended Jackson Merrill in 2025 with a nine-year, $135 million deal and gave shortstop Xander Bogaerts $280 million over 11 years in free agency in 2023.\n\nNot all these contracts looked good at the time they were given out and some still do not look very good today. However, this offseason has shown the cost for star-level major league players is climbing rapidly and the contracts like the ones given to Cronenworth or Bogaerts may look better from one year to the next moving forward.\n\nThe farm system is depleted because of multiple trades over the past couple of seasons, but Preller has shown the ability to scout, identify and acquire talent that allows him to continue to make deadline deals year after year.\n\nDepending on what you read or hear, the San Diego fanbase seems divided about Preller’s future with the Padres. He has his supporters and he has people who would happily pack his bags if it meant he could leave town faster. Preller has said he wants to be in San Diego, and the players seem to want him, too. Sooner or later a deal for Preller needs to get done and if it is not with the Padres, there is little doubt another team would not jump at the chance to bring him into their organization.",

    "fullText": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s rise in the NBA has unfolded in real time. When he entered the league in 2018, few viewed him as a future MVP. Yet he reached that level and captured a championship with the Oklahoma City Thunder along the way. Today, he is firmly among the league’s elite, and a major reason for that is the confidence with which he carries himself on and off the court.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was one of the starters in the All-Star game this weekend, where he spoke about his mindset. Now, there will be people chiming in and calling him a “foul baiter”, but his talent cannot be denied. In late game moments when the whole team appears to be nervous and rushing to get points, he remains calm, and that actually works.\n\nThe Thunder star is firmly of the belief that what happens today doesn’t matter tomorrow. So, in his mind, the only thing he cares about his getting better with each passing day.\n\nSpeaking about his style of play, the Canadian said, “I have the utmost confidence in my game. Everybody’s trying to speed it up. And I’m not Usain Bolt.”\n\nGilgeous-Alexander hasn’t been in many losing situations over the last two years, and when he has, he’s helped the Thunder wiggle its way out on several occasions. In “within ten-points” situations in the 2025-26 season, the Thunder have had a winning percentage of >85%. That shows that they rarely panic, and SGA being on the floor genuinely helps with that.\n\n“I’m not about to outrun anybody. I gotta slow down. It’s that simple. You run fast, I go slow,” Gilgeous-Alexander added.\n\nSGA is once again one of the favorites to win MVP this season. He is averaging 31.8 points, a stat line that, halfway through the regular season, highlights just how consistently dominant he has been. The Thunderas a whole have struggled a bit lately, with them losing the “#1 record in the NBA bragging rights” to the Detroit Pistons right before the All-Star break. They’re 42-14 and 5-5 in their last 10 games.\n\nThe Thunder have to improve, of course, but SGA needs to keep doing what he always does: be calm, believe in himself, and score points. It’s what makes him a front-runner for the best player in the league award.\n\nThe post Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Explains How “Utmost Confidence” in His Game Is Key to Late-Game Poise appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Ryan Blaney was not a fan of how the Toyota drivers raced in the Daytona 500 on Sunday. They employed aggressive fuel-saving tactics, but that was not his main issue. Instead, Blaney took exception to the way they ran three-wide and effectively blocked the entire field while slowing the pace to save fuel.\n\nBlaney’s call for action drew responses from within the Toyota camp, including 23XI Racing owner Denny Hamlin. Tyler Reddick’s crew chief, Billy Scott, also weighed in after a successful day for the team. With Reddick capturing the Harley J. Earl Trophy and opening the season on a high note, Scott made it clear he saw nothing wrong with the Toyota drivers’ approach.\n\nScott explained his stance, “I doubt there’s a fix to it because we’re just going to figure out the next way to exploit it, and I don’t know that it needs to be fixed. I think we all, as competitors, are spending as much time trying to figure out what the next best thing is and how to combat what the other is doing. I mean, I think it would be like asking if you need to change how chess is played.”\n\nScottbelieves that such tactics are what make the sport interesting to watch and be a part of. Blaneyis certainly not going to agree with that. Hamlin, the senior-most Toyota driver on the field, expressed his thoughts on the matter as well. Unlike Scott, he recognized fuel-saving methods as an issue and delved into what the solution for them could be.\n\nIn light of the situation, Hamlin, once again, explained that increasing the speed of the car is the only fix. He strongly believes that doing so will spread the field and resolve what Blaney and the others are worried about. He further went a step ahead and proposed an experiment that NASCAR ought to try soon.\n\n“One of the suggestions that we talked about just a few days ago is to come here next year in the Clash,” he said. “Let a few of us come up with a package that we think you won’t see any fuel saving, you’re just going to see people hanging on. That would be the only fix.” Increasing the speed limits of the engines means the sport will become more like it was in the past.\n\nThe fans will love that for sure. But NASCAR’s safety department and insurance companies will dread the outcome.\n\nThe post Denny Hamlin and Billy Scott Give Harsh Reality Check on Ryan Blaney’s Demand to Fix Superspeedway Racing appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "1 hot 103-win Big Ten coach Kansas State MBB cannot target after Jerome Tang's firing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCoach Jerome Tang's relationship with the Kansas State Wildcats is no longer, as Sunday night saw the school announce the pair had gone their separate ways, despite only six regular-season games remaining before conference tournament play starts March 10 in Kansas City.\n\nBoth the school and Tang have released statements regarding the situation. The Wildcats' brass intends to fire Tang \"for cause\" and not honor his $18.7 million buyout despite this season's on-court performance potentially being another justifiable reason. The Wildcats (10-15, 1-11 Big 12) have failed to reach the NCAA Tournament under Tang's direction in all but one season of his tenure that began in 2022.\n\nUnder Tang, the Wildcats advanced to the Elite Eight in 2023, but it was never built upon in future seasons.\n\nNow, the program looks for a clean slate.\n\nMORE: Is this freshman class the greatest in college basketball history? Depends how you keep score\n\n\"This was a decision that was made in the best interest of our university and men's basketball program,\" AD Gene Taylor said. \"Recent public comments and conduct, in addition to the program's overall direction, have not aligned with K-State's standards for supporting student-athletes and representing the university. We wish Coach Tang and his family all the best moving forward.\"\n\nTang sees the change differently, though, and personally.\n\n\"I am deeply disappointed with the university’s decision and strongly disagree with the characterization of my termination,\" Tang said. \"I have always acted with integrity and faithfully fulfilled my responsibilities as head coach.\"\n\nTang added he was grateful to those closest to him, but didn't have many kind words for the Wildcats on the way out.\n\n\"I would like to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the opportunity to serve as head coach at Kansas State,\" Tang added. \"It has been one of the great honors of my life. I am grateful to the players, staff, and fans who make this program so special. I remain proud of what we built together and confident that I have always acted in the best interests of the university and our student-athletes.”\n\nAs for who could replace Tang, a few options have already been thrown around by national insiders. But one name in particular, Illinois coach Brad Underwood, has continued to get thrown around nearly once a year in hypothetical coaching cycles as his team's success levels up.\n\nEven though Underwood has Big 12 ties from his days as the coach of the Oklahoma State Cowboys (2016-2017) and his playing and coaching career, which spanned between 1984-2012 with stops at Western Illinois, South Carolina (associate head coach) and Stephen F. Austin, to name a few, a reunion in Manhattan is not possible.\n\nMORE: Big Ten rankings: How Michigan, Nebraska, Illinois, Michigan State, Purdue did in AP Poll\n\nPer the current terms of Underwood's contract with Illinois, a position he has held since before the 2017 season, he can't jump ship even if he were to try to.\n\nIn a quote-tweet responding to Jeff Goodman of The Field of 68, Illini Inquirer's Jeremy Werner set the record straight.\n\n\"1) He has a non-compete clause with all of college basketball. He can't leave. 2) #illini are a top-tier Big Ten program. Why would he leave?\" Werner tweeted.\n\nWerner's second bullet is an opinion rather than a verifiable fact, but he has a point. Illinois went to the Elite Eight in 2024, securing its second Big Ten Tournament title in Underwood's tenure after having done so three years earlier. But unlike the 2021 season, 2024 marked the farthest Illinois has advanced in the tournament since 2004-2005, when it lost the national title game to North Carolina.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, Underwood isn't leaving Champaign anytime soon and has secured 103 Big Ten wins in nearly a decade.\n\nAnd there's still more work to do.\n\nHubert Davis buyout, contract details as UNC Tar Heels coach\n\n'Basketball Saved My Life': Why Master P came home to rebuild New Orleans\n\nBruce Pearl sends warning to NBA teams about Kansas' Darryn Peterson\n\nWhy FOX blocked St. John’s from participating in a major college basketball event\n\nJohn Calipari says college athletics is broken — Here’s his plan to fix It",

    "description": "Friars top prospect needs a breakout 2026 season.",
    "fullText": "Rejoice, San Diego Padres baseball is back!\n\nFull squad workouts have begun in preparation for the 2026 season. And by the end of the week, we will have digested our first Cactus League clash.\n\nNot too many major league Spring Training camps have two legitimate stars like Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr. beginning their work for the coming season. Each will continue to anchor the Padres’ lineup at the top of the order. Normally, we would be discussing their impact on the team’s success.\n\nInstead, all eyes will be on Ethan Salas, who is entering the crossroads of his pro career.\n\nNo question, his stock has declined, as Salas is no longer atop the consensus top prospect lists. Baseball America ranked him No. 8 in their 2024 MLB prospect list. Now, Salas is ranked No. 90 in this year’s prospect list. Injuries and struggles at the plate have contributed to his demise.\n\nSo, not great news for Salas, who is the Friar’s top international free agent signing at 16 years old for $ 5.6 million. Despite all the uncertainty, the organization invited him to major league camp as a non-roster invitee.\n\nSince his arrival, his offensive production has been disappointing. In three minor league seasons, Salas has a career batting average of .221, accompanied by underwhelming power numbers. He has 58 extra-base hits in 800 minor league at-bats. But what is more alarming is that he struck out in 22.5% of his plate appearances. It is not a bad percentage if you were a proven power-hitter.\n\nLast season, Salas hit .188 in 10 games at Double-A San Antonio. The 19-year-old missed the remainder of the season due to a stress reaction in his lower back. Thus, another lost season in his development.\n\nThe one constant in his up-and-down pro career has been his defense, as Salas is considered one of the top defensive catching prospects in baseball. Scouts have graded him with high marks (70-fielding and 60-arm) on their 20-80 grade scale. It is the reason why Salas is still in conversation as a potential major league call-up candidate.\n\nThe odds are high that Salas will begin the 2026 campaign in the minors. The Padres do not have a spot on the Opening Day roster for him, as all the competitors for the backup catcher role have a proven track record in the majors.\n\nYou can argue that injuries have left him a shell of his former self. But Salas has an opportunity in the major league camp to show he can be productive at the plate and hopefully remain injury-free for the upcoming season.\n\nIt is not impossible to believe the Friars might be inclined to trade Salas before breaking camp. Nevertheless, other clubs may be reluctant to acquire him due to concerns regarding his offensive production. If the market for Salas is lower than expected, then let him develop in the minors. Hopefully, he fulfills his potential and becomes a more complete player.\n\nIt is not impossible to envision Salas turning his career around. He is young enough to improve offensively.\n\nAll the talk is over; Salas must prove he is a potential fixture in a major league lineup. He is at the crossroads of his Padres career; something has to give in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nIn 1960, the St. Louis Hawks took Bob Sims, a 6-foot-5 guard, in the seventh round of the NBA draft out of Pepperdine University. The Southland native made his league debut during the 1961-62 season as a member of the Lakers, and he appeared in 19 games with them that season, averaging 3.3 points, 1.4 rebounds and 0.6 assists in nine minutes a game.\n\nHis player rights were traded to the Hawks midway through that campaign. Sims exited the league after the 1961-62 season, and he would later play in the American Basketball Association with the Anaheim Amigos during the 1967-68 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 24 — Bob Sims",

    "description": "From a variety of roles, Szoboszlai has reached double figures for the season while looking a worthy inheritor of Steven Gerrard’s No 8 shirt and a future Liverpool captain",
    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah was speaking from a position of experience and expertise. “He is one of the best players in the world right now,” said a man who could have been described in such terms for much of the past decade. Many a Liverpool player in that time has been asked to eulogise about Salah. Now it may have been a sign of a shift in the pecking order at Anfield that he was being invited to praise Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\nSalah did, and willingly. While, when the Egyptian was dropped in November and the Hungarian took his spot on the right wing, they are friends, and when Szoboszlai has borrowed Salah’s yoga-inspired goal celebration against Barnsley, it was an affectionate tribute. Now, in another role reversal, Szoboszlai has outscored Salah.\n\nArne Slot has had his disagreements with Salah this season but, without going quite as far as the winger, said: “I think there are a lot of very good-to-elite football players in the world but I definitely agree with Mo that Dom is one of them.”\n\nA statistic may support that argument. Szoboszlai’s latest all-action display came against Brighton in the FA Cup but this season, only Kylian Mbappe has more goal contributions in the Champions League. He has eight, scoring four, assisting four. There are big contributions among them. Szoboszlai has a late winner against Inter in San Siro. He supplied Alexis Mac Allister for the only goal against Real Madrid. He took the corner for Virgil van Dijk’s injury-time decider against Atletico Madrid. He put Liverpool ahead in Marseille.\n\nNo wonder, then, that Salah said: “This season we rely on him so much.” There had been, however, a temptation to wonder if his status would slip this season, following the arrival of Florian Wirtz. Instead, he has started every Premier or Champions League game this season, apart from when he has been banned. It was evident Slot liked Szoboszlai in his debut year at Anfield; but it was notable, too, that the head coach said that, to play in midfield for Liverpool, you had to score goals. The Hungarian got too few, eight in 49 then.\n\n“When said that I maybe had to add that you need to run a lot if you play in the midfield for Liverpool,” said Slot now. “But I think what I meant was, as a No.10, you need to produce goals.”\n\nWhich Szoboszlai is now doing, but from a variety of roles. He reached double figures for the campaign on Saturday – equalling his best return for RB Leipzig – but the 10th came with a powerful surge from deep as a central midfielder. His spectacular free kicks against Arsenal and Manchester City each came when operating as a right-back. “He hasn’t always played in the No 10 position but is producing more and more goals,” noted Slot.\n\nPart of it stems from his set-piece expertise; so do his assists. Szoboszlai can take free kicks that Salah used to get or corners that, in previous years, would have gone to Trent Alexander-Arnold. He has long struck the ball in a way that exudes class. Now it brings more menace. More excitement, too: when striding forward but outside the box on Saturday, the Liverpool faithful were calling on him to shoot.\n\nWhen he does, he seems to be turning Liverpool’s goal-of-the-season award into a one-man contest. Their player of the year prize had already felt decided: Szoboszlai again. One comparison with Liverpool’s past could be Danny Murphy, their player of 2002-03 but in a disappointing campaign when too many others underachieved.\n\nYet the barnstorming run that brought his goal on Saturday and his ferocious long-range shooting are more reminiscent of perhaps Liverpool’s most iconic captain, who was also no stranger to starring as others struggled. “Actually, I am not playing a Steven Gerrard season although he was a legend for the club,” insisted Szoboszlai. “I try to do my own story.”\n\nEverything in it can revolve around him. He seems to have inherited some of Gerrard’s main-character energy. Szoboszlai has gone into overdrive in 2026. In his last nine games, he has five goals, two assists, one goal given away in ridiculous fashion against Barnsley and one red card. He was man of the match at Arsenal and, had Liverpool held on to their lead against Manchester City, probably would have received the award again. He has looked a worthy inheritor of Gerrard’s No 8 shirt.\n\nHe may yet get his armband. Szoboszlai looks a leader and a path to the captaincy is opening up. Alexander-Arnold left last summer, Andy Robertson may follow this, perhaps Salah too. Virgil van Dijk has 18 months left on his deal and is 34. Szoboszlai seems a possible successor.\n\n“He is still young,” warned Slot. “He has a lot of attributes already, especially when it comes to leading by example. There is still a step to make in terms of leadership, a voice in the dressing room if I compare him to Virgil, which is completely normal. Virgil is 34 and has seen [James] Milner, [Jordan] Henderson and these players, so it’s really good for Dominik that he sees Virgil.”\n\nBut when Salah sees Szoboszlai now, he believes he is watching one of the world’s best players. And that is a sign of what a stunning season the Hungarian is having.",

    "fullText": "Former Oklahoma Sooners tight ends coach Joe Jon Finley was the first coaching staff domino to fall in Norman this offseason, but he's reportedly found a new home, and he'll be coaching in the Pac-12 in 2026. Finley was dismissed by the Sooners on January 1st after five years on the job.\n\nNow, Finley will coach at Texas State as an offensive assistant on head coach G.J. Kinne's staff, according to a report from CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Finley will be working with the quarterbacks in San Marcos, despite having no prior experience coaching the position.\n\nFinley played the tight end position at Oklahoma from 2004 to 2007, and he had an excellent final two seasons for the Sooners. After playing in the NFL from 2008 to 2012, he began his coaching career at Oklahoma and at the high school level. After a stop at Baylor, he began coaching tight ends at both Missouri and Texas A&M.\n\nFinley was the passing game coordinator at Ole Miss in 2020, before former OU head coach Lincoln Riley hired him back to his alma mater to coach his old tight end position. Finley stayed on when head coach Brent Venables took over, working under new offensive coordinator Jeff Lebby in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWhen Lebby, who has a close relationship with Finley, left to become the head man at Mississippi State, Finley was promoted to co-offensive coordinator with Seth Littrell at OU, with Littrell calling the plays. That arrangement lasted just seven games in 2024 before Littrell was fired, and Finley was promoted again, this time to play-caller. Offensive analyst Kevin Johns would replace Littrell, serving as the interim co-OC and QBs coach, while Finley continued to coach the tight ends.\n\nFinley called the offensive plays for the final six games of the '24 season, and stayed on staff when Ben Arbuckle was hired as the offensive coordinator. However, he was demoted back to only coaching tight ends in 2025. For the past few seasons, Finley's tight ends have been a weak point on the roster, after having early success during his first couple of years back in Norman.\n\nTexas State is set to hire Joe Jon Finley as an offensive assistant, sources tell @CBSSports.\n\nWill work with the team’s QBs. The former NFL tight end was tight ends coach and co-OC at Oklahoma the last five seasons. Was previously pass game coordinator at Ole Miss. pic.twitter.com/eNOlVTzu5w\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) February 15, 2026\n\nFinley has been replaced by new tights ends coach Jason Witten, but he's landed on his feet in a support staff role with the Bobcats, who are joining the new-look Pac-12 this year. This means that all three of Oklahoma's co-offensive coordinators from the 2024 season are now either support staffers or position coaches, with Littrell as the senior offensive analyst at Tennessee, Finley as an offensive assistant working with quarterbacks at Texas State, and Johns working under Lebby at Mississippi State as the quarterbacks coach in Starkville.\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Former Oklahoma Sooners TE coach lands with Pac-12 program",

    "description": "Or is he?…the FC Bayern coach has acknowledged that maybe strikers are just built different.",
    "fullText": "Breaking Gerd Müller’s record for goals in a single Bundesliga season-40 in 34 games- seemed utterly impossible. The Bayern Munich legend is one of the greatest goal scorers in the history of the sport. Surely, he could not be caught. Then a new Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski arrived on the scene and broke it, plundering an incredible 41 goals in 29 games with a goal in the dying embers of the final matchday.\n\nNow it is Harry Kane’s turn to try to break the record. He came fairly close in the first season and fell further behind in his second season. Now in his third, he has 26 goals with 12 games remaining. Could he break the record this season?\n\nAsked about this possibility after a Kane brace led Bayern to a 3-0 win in the Bundesliga against Werder Bremen, head coach Vincent Kompany deflected the question: “I assume that the league title is much more important for him than the record,” he said, as captured by @iMiaSanMia. “But maybe I’m wrong because I was a defender not a striker [laughs]. He’s Harry Kane, he has and will always score goals.”\n\nLewandowski missed 5 games the season he broke the record. Kane has yet to miss a match and will likely need to carry this through the season to have any hope of reaching 42 goals.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have reportedly done the most groundwork, alongside Liverpool, to sign Nottingham Forest centre back, Murillo.\n\nThe Blues have been linked with him quite a few times recently, and it is a name that does not seem to go away suggesting that it could be a serious move that they look to try and pull off.\n\nDoing groundwork on a deal is something that clubs will do all the time, mainly with the agent of the player to make sure that there is an interest on the player side as well, before moving on to negotiate a fee with his club.\n\nMurillo arrives for a Nottingham Forest match. (Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to a report from TEAMtalk this week, Murillo is preparing to leave Nottingham Forest this summer.\n\nHis camp ‘are actively assessing potential landing spots’ right now ahead of the summer window at the end of the season.\n\nThe report goes on to say that Chelsea and Liverpool have done more groundwork on Murillo than any other club over the past 12 months, with both sides even weighing up bids last summer.\n\nChelsea are still looking for a new centre back despite bringing back Mamadou Sarr in the January transfer window, and it appears that Murillo is certainly one name to watch here.\n\nCole Palmer has fired himself into the league’s top players in terms of xG per 90 and goals per 90. A nice rest this weekend gives him an even better platform to perform this weekend when we play Burnley.\n\nChelsea also have been linked with Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. His stats are great, but at his age and price it’s just not a deal we can see happening.",

    "title": "On This Day (16th Feb 1991): Clough’s Final Visit To Roker As A Manager Ends In Defeat",
    "description": "On this day in 1991, former Sunderland striker Brian Clough made his final appearance at Roker Park as a manager.",
    "fullText": "It had been 27 years since Brian Clough had graced the turf at Roker Park as a Sunderland player, but a record of 63 goals in 74 appearances would ensure that on this in 1991, he would receive a hero’s welcome on Wearside.\n\nThe man in charge at Roker at the time was Denis Smith, and he was beginning his fourth season as manager of Sunderland – and perhaps remarkably, it was in the First Division. After taking over from Lawrie McMenemy following relegation to Division Three in the summer of 1987, it had taken Smith only three years to return Sunderland to the top flight for the first time since 1984-85.\n\nThis meteoric rise, however, had been achieved with fortune going in our favour. Sunderland had finished 6th in Division Two the previous season and gained promotion despite defeat in the play-off final thanks to Swindon Town’s financial irregularities.\n\nThe rate of knots at which Denis Smith had dragged the club through the divisions meant that six players who were in the starting XI for Sunderland’s first game in the Third Division in 1987 against Brentford at Griffin Park, also featured in our starting XI for the opening day of the First Division campaign against Norwich City at Carrow Road – John Kay, Reuben Agboola, Gary Bennett, John MacPhail, Gary Owers and Gordon Armstrong – while a seventh, Marco Gabbiadini, had obviously featured prominently in what was at that point our only season in Division Three in the clubs history.\n\nAt our first board meeting after it had been confirmed that we would be replacing Swindon in the First Division, I asked, “what money have you got to strengthen?\n\nAt that meeting my budget for transfer fees was set at £500,000, but I was not given an increase in wage budget. So if I wanted to bring anyone in I would have to prune my existing squad first.\n\nWith the money at his disposal, he signed Kevin Ball in a deal worth £350,000 from Portsmouth in view of John MacPhail’s departure, and Eric Gates was replaced with Peter Davenport from Middlesbrough, who almost broke the bank at £300,000. Despite early promise in the form of an impressive home draw against Tottenham Hotspur, which was backed up by a victory over Manchester United in the space of five days in August, Sunderland remained in the bottom six from September onwards.\n\nIt was clear Denis Smith needed reinforcements for the run-in, and at the beginning of February, the board relented and handed over £225,000 for the manager to spend on Republic of Ireland under-21 international Brian Mooney from Third Division Preston North End.\n\nEvery time I had seen him he had played extremely well and looked really fast, with an ability to go past people, hurting defences. But I have to admit I got this one wrong. John McGrath stitched me up. Mooney was a bad signing. I’d go so far as to say a disaster. He seemed to be carrying an injury that affected his pace and mobility. In short he was a disaster.\n\nSnowstorms had battered England in the week leading up to the game, which was officially given the go-ahead only 48 hours ahead of kick-off. Denis Smith struggled to attend a reserve game at Elland Road to run the rule over Bulgarian international left-back Alexander Markov, who was on trial at Roker from Slavia Sofia. The evidence of the hard work to keep the game on as scheduled could be seen in the piles of snow around the edge of the pitch as the two sides took to the field.\n\nAs well as a debut for Brian Mooney, an injury to Paul Hardyman meant that 19-year-old Anthony Smith was also in the starting line-up for the first time since the end of October, when he experienced a torrid evening as Sunderland went down 6-0 to relegation rivals Derby County in the Rumbelows Cup.\n\nNottingham Forest, who were sitting comfortably in mid-table in the First Division, began the day as favourites, but it was Sunderland who started brightly with Gabbiadini going close early on with a header that was smartly tipped over by Mark Crossley. Gordon Armstrong also made Crossley pull off an impressive save with five minutes of the first half remaining, when he hit a shot from six yards out straight at the Forest keeper.\n\nSunderland finally beat Crossley from the resultant corner to take the lead, when a well-worked set piece resulted in Colin Pascoe finding Kevin Ball at the back post, who headed back across goal for Marco to nod in from close range. It was Gabbiadini’s ninth goal of the season in Division One, but his first goal in ten games.\n\nAt the beginning of the second half, Roy Keane almost set up Phil Starbuck, who saw his shot saved smartly by Tony Norman in the Sunderland goal. Denis Smith’s side could have extended their lead late on as a long ball by Kevin Ball set Gabbiadini free beyond the Forest back four, but brave goalkeeping at the striker’s feet once again saved the day for Clough’s side.\n\nSunderland held on for all three points to pull six points clear of the drop, but despite the fact that only two sides were relegated that year due to the expansion of the top flight to 22 teams, Denis Smith’s side ended up as one of them. Almost doing enough, despite the lack of support for the manager in the transfer market, but fell at the final hurdle against Manchester City in May.\n\nBob Murray accepts that this was a mistake now. More than it was a big error that would eventually destabilise the club and my career, sending both into a wilderness from which neither would recover for some years. If we’d realised the opportunity in 1990 that was there for us to push on then Sunderland could have been amongst the top five or six teams in the country, but we didn’t.\n\nSunderland 1-0 Nottingham Forest\n\nSunderland: Norman, Owers, Bennett, Ball, Smith, Mooney, Bracewell, Armstrong, Pascoe, Davenport, Gabbiadini Substitutes not used: Kay, Atkinson\n\nNottingham Forest: Crossley, Laws, Chettle, Walker, Pearce, Starbuck (Crosby), Keane, Gaynor (Hodge), Parker, Wilson, Clough",

The only thing missing was the guy who is universally considered as the best shooter ever, Steph Curry.\n\nCurry has won the contest twice before (2015 and 2021), but he didn’t participate this year. The rest of the field won’t be so lucky next year though, as Curry vowed to return to compete in the contest in 2027 and bring some friends with him.\n\n\"One hundred percent,\" Curry said of his participation. \"I already scheduled it. We're gonna bring some people. Me, Dame [Damian Lillard], I'm gonna try to get Klay [Thompson], Dev [Devin Booker].\"\n\nWith two wins to his name, Curry needs one more win in the contest to enter a tie for the most all-time with Lillard, Larry Bird and Craig Hodges. All three of those guys won the contest on three separate occasions.\n\nCurry's participation would immediately make the event a must-see.

There’s always a risk of faltering against lower league teams by slowing down to their tempo, but that never happened and everyone played brilliantly.\n\nIt was a tough battle at times with their directness, but we showed good team spirit and got the job done.\n\nWilson Isidor and Eliezer Mayenda were poor and neither of them gave Régis Le Bris nor Brian Brobbey anything to worry or think about.\n\nI’m aware that it must be difficult to have played so much last season and even at the start of this season only to be pushed out of the team, but Brobbey was signed for £20 million and has played really well so he deserves to start.\n\nI love them both but Mayenda and Isidor need to improve and do more.\n\nGiven that we seem to have had a weekend of narrow results against Premier League opposition (Arsenal aside), it was reassuring to see such a controlled performance.\n\nWith our lineup being as strong as it was, we can rest assured that Régis Le Bris is taking the cup seriously and although we only won by a one-goal margin, we dominated in all areas.\n\nHad their goalkeeper not performed as well as he did, we would’ve been looking at a comfortable three or four-goal win.\n\nLike many others, I’ve been bemused to see the amount of ill-advised comments about Mundle over the past few weeks, so it was fantastic to see him attacking their full back from the off.\n\nAt times, he was our strongest threat and I hope that this game will give Mundle the confidence to push on and seize opportunities when they arise.\n\nTo write off one of our own players in a much more challenging league after coming back from a serious injury is nothing short of pathetic, and I hope that Mundle gets his own “Watson-esque” moment to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nFrom not knowing where we’d signed players from to just blatantly spouting rubbish, I don’t think I’ve heard two worse commentators for one of our games for quite some time. Sadly, TNT Sports have a deal with the FA for several more years.\n\nHere’s hoping we get a home draw in the next round, or at the very least, we get some more competent people to work on our game.\n\nWhilst the rise of Brobbey has been something to behold, we do need other players to be available in that position.\n\nFor me, though I suppose you could put it to a lack of service at points. Wilson Isidor did very little to challenge Brobbey for that starting role up front and I was hoping that much like the West Ham home game, this would be the chance for both Isidor and Eliezer Mayenda to get on the scoresheet and show what they’re capable of.\n\nAs things stand, for me personally, there’s a gap in quality between Brobbey and his competitors.",

    "fullText": "Florida State softball has concluded their trip to Clearwater, capping it off with a matchup against the Tennessee Lady Volunteers.\n\nMakenna Reid took the circle first, as FSU was the designated home team. The Lady Vols quickly got on base, with back to back singles. With two on base, the cleanup hitter for UT took advantage, with a 3 run homerun.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning, the Seminoles faced Sage Mardjetko. Mardjetko only allowed Isa Torres to reach, and struck out two of her three next batters.\n\nLooking to respond in the home half, Anna Hinde led off with a single. Marjetko loaded the bases, adding Angelee Bueno and Bella Ruggiero with two outs. With ‘Noles at every bag, a hit by pitch to Torres made it 3-1. Karlyn Pickens took over in the circle, getting the final out of the inning for Tennessee.\n\nReid led off with a hit by pitch, before a fly out gave FSU an out. With a runner on base, Marlee Gaskell replaced Reid. In relief, Gaskell got an out before she had two walks and three singles to her line. All hits resulted in RBI’s, making it 7-1 in favor of the Lady Vols.\n\nBoth pitchers kept it 7-1 going into the final inning. Gaskell had a walk before UT put two more runs on the board via a 2 run homerun. Ashtyn Danley came in to pitch the last two outs, getting the Lady Vols on a fly out and ground out.\n\nPickens only allowed a single in the bottom of the inning, as FSU fell to the third ranked team in the country, 9-1.\n\nFSU will host the Louisiana Ragin Cajuns on Tuesday Feb. 17th in Tallahassee.

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce made a cheeky reference to his fiancée Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The Kelce brothers showcased their creativity for Valentine’s Day by making cheeky, punny cards. The Chiefs’ tight end made sweet references to Jumanji, his NFL career, and even Swift’s sourdough obsession. However, fans were impressed by Kelce’s witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood” in one of the creatives shared via an Instagram carousel.\n\nTravis Kelce referenced Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The New Heights podcast’s official Instagram account shared a carousel showcasing their wholesome Valentine’s Day greetings. The first slide in the carousel read, “Wood you be my Valentine?” accompanied by an animated tree and Kelce smiling.\n\nFor those who missed it, this is a reference to Swift’s raunchy track “Wood” from her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl. Notably, the global pop star has dedicated the song to her fiancé. The lyrics make a cheeky reference to Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, and his manhood as well. Swift sings, “New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood) / I ain’t gotta knock on wood” (via Page Six).\n\nFans are loving Kelce’s sweet tribute to Swift and lavished praise in the comments section. One fan commented, “Y’all had the opportunity to do the funniest thing and you did! Good job!!!” A second fan wrote, “These are too good,” accompanied by a laughing emoji. A third fan penned, “WOOD YOU BE MY VALENTINE HAHAHAHAHAH 13/13,” accompanied by clapping emojis. Finally, one fan remarked, “The wood one is my fav.”\n\nFans joked that Kelce is redeeming himself after previously not understanding a witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood.” During the Wednesday, January 21, episode of New Heights, Kelce joked that “Taylor’s gonna kill me” for missing a clear reference to Swift’s song “Wood.”\n\nThe post Travis Kelce’s Valentine’s Day Card Comes With Taylor Swift Twist appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Two days before the Monaco-PSG match, in the Champions League playoff first leg, already 10 absentees are to be noted in total, but numerous other players are uncertain, including Ousmane Dembele and Maghnes Akliouche.\n\nPSG and AS Monaco had very different preparations on Friday. While Luis Enrique's men lost 3-1 at Rennes, Sebastien Pocognoli's team won by the same score against FC Nantes with a brace from Simon Adingra, the Ivorian winger recruited this winter by AS Monaco, who will be able to play against PSG Tuesday night.\n\nTwo days before Monaco-PSG, no fewer than 8 players are already confirmed to miss the match due to injury. On the Parisian side, only one player is definitely out: Quentin Ndjantou. The young Parisian midfielder recently underwent thigh surgery and will not play again for several weeks.\n\nUncertainty surrounds several other Parisians, however, starting with Fabian Ruiz and Senny Mayulu, who were ruled out against Rennes on Friday. The Spanish midfielder has been absent since Jan. 20 due to the knee blow he received against Sporting CP, while the young French midfielder felt minor discomfort in his left calf this week. According to Le Parisien, both will be ruled out against Monaco on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to L'Equipe, Ousmane Dembele also came out with minor discomfort against Rennes when he was substituted in the 74th minute by Goncalo Ramos. Minor discomfort that does not seem likely to call his participation in the Monaco match into question, according to Le Parisien. Injured Friday in the shoulder and replaced by Dro Fernandez in the 71st minute, Joao Neves should also be available, according to L'Equipe and Le Parisien, but that remains to be confirmed in the coming hours.\n\nOn the AS Monaco side, the infirmary is full to the brim and three long-term injured players are already confirmed to miss the match as they were completely removed from AS Monaco's UEFA list last week. They are Mohammed Salisu, Takumi Minamino and Paul Pogba. Other players have been injured for some time and will not return on Tuesday: Lukas Hradecky, Eric Dier, Pape Cabral and Kassoum Ouattara.\n\nDuring their win against Nantes, Monaco also lost Maghnes Akliouche to injury in the 41st minute. According to Sebastien Pocognoli, the French international \"was hit muscularly\" after \"a flexion at his hip on a poorly weighted back pass.\" Akliouche was scheduled to undergo medical exams on Saturday and the severity of his potential injury is not yet known, but he is very uncertain about the visit of PSG.\n\nLamine Camara, Lucas Chevalier's best friend (sic), was substituted just past the hour mark after receiving a blow to the Achilles tendon from a Nantes player: \"Concerning Lamine, it's more prevention, because he received a somewhat dangerous tackle that was surprisingly not called. It was the same for Vanderson, Zak' (Denis Zakaria) and Folarin (Balogun), whom we wanted to preserve,\" Monaco's Belgian coach said Friday night, sounding rather reassuring about his Senegalese midfielder.\n\nOften injured this season and absent since Jan. 3, central defender Christian Mawissa has still not resumed group training and while he is not yet officially ruled out for Tuesday, his presence is very uncertain there as well. Monaco did, however, recover last Friday its Spanish attacker Ansu Fati, who is no longer injured and played 30 minutes against Nantes.\n\nAbsentees for Monaco-PSG with two days to go:\n\nInjured (10): Ndjantou, Ruiz, Mayulu, Salisu, Minamino, Pogba, Hradecky, Dier, Cabral, Ouattara.\n\nDoubtful (5): Dembele, Neves, Akliouche, Camara, Mawissa.\n\nRoundtablesports is Free to join!

    "fullText": "Redemption for Scotland as they end England's unbeaten run, Ireland squeeze past improving Italy, and can anyone stop France?\n\nHere are the main talking points from an enthralling second round of the Six Nations.\n\nThere were questions asked of Scotland and head coach Gregor Townsend after the opening weekend defeat by Italy but you would struggle to find a more emphatic riposte than their 31-20 victory over England.\n\nScotland started brilliantly and never took their foot off the gas to hand Steve Borthwick's side a first defeat in 13 and improve on their dominant recent record in Calcutta Cup games, having now won six of the past nine.\n\nSpeaking to the Rugby Union Weekly podcast, former Scotland international Johnnie Beattie said: \"This was special. They were humbled last weekend in Rome and this time we had a chance to humble England here and came through.\n\n\"Everything that went wrong last week was righted. We fought and scrapped for everything. It was fully deserved and a comprehensive Calcutta Cup win.\"\n\nBeattie said Scotland always had the capacity to win one-off games against top sides but they needed more consistency.\n\n\"They've had these seminal moments but not put together a consistent run that would put them in a position to compete for a championship,\" he added.\n\n\"It's how consistently can you find ways to beat these top-level opposition and Scotland don't have the answer yet. Can you finish in the top three? There are some huge games. We have to back it up.\"\n\n'Murrayfield pain will make England a better team'\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nEngland went into the game against Scotland looking for a 13th straight win and a first in Edinburgh since 2020, but were unable to cope with Scotland's energy and intensity.\n\nThey lost last week's hat-trick hero Henry Arundell to an early yellow card, which later became a red, and when they threatened to stage a comeback a chargedown on George Ford's drop-goal attempt led to Huw Jones' eighth try against England - the most of any player in the Six Nations era.\n\n\"Scotland were 20 points better not 11. They were comprehensive winners,\" ex-England scrum-half Matt Dawson told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"In the cold light of day England were taken apart from minute one to minute 80. Scotland were miles better.\"\n\nThe loss was England's fourth in their past five Six Nations away matches and Dawson questioned their tactics.\n\n\"For me it wasn't so much about the kicking game. It was like if that's not working what else are you going to do? Scotland had done their homework and defended ferociously and England were getting no change out of it, so what's the tactic?,\" said Dawson.\n\n\"England didn't adjust accordingly. It was a masterclass from the Scotland coaching staff because England were nowhere.\"\n\nFormer England winger Chris Ashton told Rugby Special he felt England looked \"disjointed\" and there had been a \"snowball effect\" as errors mounted up.\n\n\"A lot of it was not being able to handle pressure. It was one thing after another so early in the game. England lost every battle,\" he added.\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\n'I felt guilty' - Tuipulotu says Scotland delivered for Townsend\n\nFrance are the only team still capable of a Grand Slam and the unbeaten Les Bleus put on another masterclass with a 54-12 win over Wales in Cardiff.\n\nIn a blistering display of speed, scything running and joie de vivre, France made 10 line-breaks in the opening 20 minutes on their way to scoring the most points they have ever racked up against Wales, surpassing the 51-0 win at Wembley in 1998.\n\nAn agile and mobile pack, allied with a magical backline playing with total freedom, the blue shirts were like a blur leaving Wales chasing shadows.\n\n\"You look at this France team and think, who stops them? They have it all,\" former Scotland international back row John Barclay told Rugby Special.\n\nAshton said the French side could \"score at will\" and singled out winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey for praise.\n\n\"His all-round game is fantastic, he always seems so confident and does things not many players can,\" he added. \"He's the go-to guy for France.\"\n\nWill anyone stop 'massive favourites' France in Six Nations?\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nThese are tough times to be a Wales fan. The hardest in living memory for a generation who grew up with regular Six Nations success and a team full of stars such as Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\nThere are many issues at play in Welsh rugby, but by any measure, recent results are a complete horror show as Sunday's record loss to France made it 13 consecutive Six Nations defeats and a 10th straight loss at home in the championship.\n\nIt's now 1,072 days since their last Six Nations victory in March 2023 v Italy in Rome and 1,464 days since their last championship win at home against Scotland in February 2022.\n\nIt appears supporters are starting to vote with their feet. The attendance against France was 57,744, making it the lowest ever Six Nations crowd in Cardiff.\n\nBut speaking after the game on BBC One, former captain Warburton was encouraged by some parts of Wales' play and said they need to look at what went well such as the maul defence, line-out and the performance of Eddie James.\n\n\"Some aspects of the game went quite well, they weren't outpowered, they were outclassed with ball handling. There are some positives to take into next week,\" said Warburton.\n\n\"Looking at the small wins, there's no point kicking them when they're down. It has to be how can we get better from this point? Which young players look like they've got the mentality?\n\n\"We're not trying to solve this in one week, we're in this for a couple of years so let's all get tight and every week look for small improvements and move forward.\"\n\nJones said there had \"definitely been green shoots\".\n\n\"The effort was there but it's international rugby and you're going to be judged on results, but it was there from an effort standpoint,\" he added.\n\nEx-England captain Martin Johnson also offered words of encouragement.\n\n\"Wales can always play and score tries, they have good rugby players so you're never that far away and they can sit there thinking they've been smashed at home against a very good French side. But there will be some games coming up where they think we can win this.\"\n\n'Heartbreaking, sad, disgrace' – Wales fans react to state of game\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nWales still rugby nation despite struggles - Tandy\n\nAfter losing to France in the opening round, Andy Farrell's side survived a scare against an improving Italy side fresh from a home victory over Scotland.\n\nIreland have won all 13 home games against Italy in the Six Nations but that 100% record came under serious threat.\n\nAshton told Rugby Special that Italy, who led at half-time, missed a wonderful opportunity to get a first victory in Ireland.\n\n\"It would have been a long 10 days for Ireland so Farrell would have been happy they got the win but Italy missed so many opportunities. They've got to be annoyed they didn't get the win,\" he told Rugby Special.\n\nFarrell has a big decision to make before Saturday's match away at England after a difficult afternoon for starting fly-half Sam Prendergast, who was replaced by Jack Crowley, with the Munster man putting in a strong showing off the bench.\n\n\"It's hard for Ireland right now, they're in a funny place. They want success all the time and it's going to be hard for them at Allianz Stadium,\" Ashton told Rugby Special.\n\nBarclay added: \"They're not quite there but you don't write them off. They've got experienced British and Irish Lions and it's just small tweaks missing.\"\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nI think Crowley starts against England - Murray\n\nItaly captain Lamaro proud perception has changed",

    "fullText": "They are competing on the world stage at the top of their game - but it's not the sport that some spectators are focusing on.\n\nFemale international athletes have told the BBC that they experience \"derogatory\" and \"weird\" online comments about their appearance.\n\nWales and Saracens rugby player Georgia Evans, who was criticised during the Women's World Cup for wearing makeup and styling her hair, said how she played had \"nothing to do with what I look like\".\n\nA 2025 survey by Women in Sport found the number of girls who dreamt of becoming professional athletes had fallen to its lowest level since 2020, which the charity said was because of gender stereotypes.\n\nAt the beginning of her career, Georgia said she received \"derogatory\" comments based on stereotypes including being referred to as a \"butch lesbian\".\n\n\"My sexuality has no bearing on whether I look girly, or whether I'm butch or whatever I present myself to be,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm not going to change who I am,\" she added.\n\n\"So I would still turn up on a game day with my tan done, my nails done, hair, everything.\"\n\nGeorgia said the \"ritual\" of wearing make-up and doing her hair helped her to forget about the cameras filming her every move on the pitch.\n\nBut her experience at the 2025 World Cup tournament in England was overshadowed when she was criticised online for wearing make-up and bows in her hair, with some even suggesting that it was to blame for the team's losses.\n\n\"It wasn't just about the big pink bow in my hair, it was about the makeup that I was wearing, about how I was treating it like a fashion show,\" she said.\n\n\"I've worked my whole life to get to the top of what rugby is, and all of a sudden, that's been called into question because I'm wearing pink bows in my hair.\n\n\"How I play has nothing to do with what I look like.\"\n\nGeorgia issued a statement on social media at the time hitting back at the comments, telling her Instagram followers \"a rugby player is no longer defined by your gender or what you look like\".\n\nShe said people from \"across the world\" sent messages of support.\n\n\"It's the silver lining of those minority of comments that had come out, had caused like a ripple effect of, when I say, hundreds of thousands of people messaging me.\n\n\"Within an hour, I had to actually turn my phone off because I just couldn't cope.\"\n\nFor Olympic gymnast Ruby Evans, how she looks is \"as important\" as the gymnastics itself.\n\n\"If I have a bad makeup day and I have to compete, it's gonna be a bad day,\" she said.\n\nBut when it's a good make-up day, the World Championship silver medallist said: \"It's the best feeling ever.\n\n\"Everything is just like falling into place, I've trained all these weeks, and then everything just goes perfect.\n\n\"Even if it wasn't as perfect, if I look good, I'm like, 'oh, you know, it's okay.\"\n\nRuby said while the majority of the comments she received online were positive, she had notice her appearance being discussed, including a time that she chose not to wear fake tan for a competition.\n\n\"That time I did wear no tan, people noticed it,\" she said.\n\n\"[I] was like oh OK, right, I know people do actually notice how I look.\"\n\n\"Usually some men online can be quite weird,\" she continued.\n\n\"My audience are little girls, so if there is a comment that's a bit [inappropriate] I do delete it, just so the people who actually watch me for gymnastics don't see that side of it.\n\n\"I just want [young girls] to look up to me, I want to be a good role model.\"\n\nDespite 2025 being a landmark year in women's sport, a recent survey by Women in Sport found the number of girls who dreamt of reaching the top in sport had fallen from 38% in 2024 to 23% in 2025.\n\nThat compared to 53% of boys who, when asked, said they dreamt of becoming top sportspeople.\n\nFormer Everton player and Wales international Gwennan Harries said social media had worsened the abuse faced by athletes.\n\nThe Bridgend-born striker, who is now a football commentator and PE teacher, also called for greater visibility of women's sport.\n\n\"The more inspirational women on TV who are showing their talents and succeeding, it'll feed down to the next generation,\" she said.\n\n\"If you don't see it, you can't be it so it's really important that those opportunities across sport are visible and is being publicized regularly with those people being treated well and respected.\"\n\nStill wearing her bright pink bows, Georgia hopes to inspire the next generation of athletes.\n\n\"I liked the idea that these young girls who are probably getting the same comments as I did when I was coming through, you can see that you don't have to change,\" she said.\n\n\"Everybody has their right to look a certain way, be a certain way and the best thing about rugby is like, it's inclusive to every single person.\"\n\nMan claimed girlfriend's death in

He holds the record for the most consecutive wins in the UFC welterweight division with 15. The first step in his plan is to win back the 170-pound championship. Islam Makhachev currently possesses the welterweight belt.\n\n\"Of course welterweight first because I don't think the other one happens without the welterweight one because it only makes sense. I'm in this division. I'm still there, so why not take that one first,\" he said.\n\n\"I think myself and Islam, Islam is a phenomenal guy, phenomenal champion what he's bee able to do. I just think, as we know, styles make a fight. And I think I'm the most difficult style for him right now, and I think I'm the best test for him because let's be honest, Islam is extremely talented. That last fight he made it look easy because the former champion just, there was a deficit in the game. And that happens to be where I'm strong as well. I think that's a tremendous matchup. I love Islam, but I think I get that title.\"\n\nIf he were able to secure a title fight with Makhachev and defeat him, Usman has been in the octagon with middleweight titleholder Khamzat Chimaev for 15 minutes. The two fought at UFC 294 in October 2023. Usman stepped in a late notice after Chimev's original opponent, Paulo Costa, was forced out of the bout with an elbow injury. Chimaev defeated Usman via majority decision.\n\n\"If I get that (welterweight) title, I think a lot of people wanted to see that rematch with Khamzat. I would love a full camp,\" said Usman. \"It was too short and I've been accustomed to fighting five-round fights.\n\n\"If I was able to get that opportunity again and to actually prepare for a big, strong Khamzat because Khamzat is extremely talented. He's done everything that was asked of him to do. So, he's a good champion, and I think having given that opportunity again I would approach that fight a little different,\" Usman continued.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s hunt for a midfielder has seen them linked with a surprise move for former Carrington graduate Scott McTominay.\n\nThe 29-year-old, who left United in 2024 after spending 22 years on the club’s books, has proven to be a revelation for Napoli.\n\nThe Scotsman guided the Gli Azzurri to the Serie A title last season, netting 13 times in all competitions and registering six assists.\n\nHis form saw him pick up the Serie A MVP award, and also be named as the world’s 18th best footballer in the Ballon d’Or race.\n\nThe Scotland international has not slowed down one bit, scoring 10 times already this season and also notching four assists.\n\nNaturally, his form has attracted several suitors, including his former club. The Napoli ace appears to have unfinished business back in the Premier League.\n\nHowever, as relayed by F365, that dream might not be realised so soon, with the Naples-based club close to agreeing a contract extension with the midfielder.\n\nThey have reportedly offered a new deal which is valid until 2030, with the option to add another year, which would see the former United star receive a wage rise.\n\nThe defending Serie A champions have reportedly received lucrative offers from the Premier League and the Saudi Pro League, prompting them to take action.\n\n“Talks are progressing well for Scott McTominay’s contract extension with Napoli. Offered a new deal until 2030 + option for 2031 and an increase in salary.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“McTominay has already received two important bids from Premier League and Saudi Clubs but his priority is staying.”\n\nIt seems the midfielder’s agent has played a blinder, drumming up interest in his client by name-dropping the 20-time English league champions, and forcing Napoli to offer him a lucrative new deal.\n\nThe truth is United do not need Scott McTominay. What they are crying out for is a deep-lying playmaker to come in and replace Casemiro.\n\nMcTominay was extensively utilised in that position by former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but it was a clear case of misprofiling as his time in Italy and his last season in Manchester have shown.\n\nWhat the former academy graduate is best at is playing closer to goal so as to arrive late into the box to finish off chances, a position currently occupied by Bruno Fernandes. Hopefully, this latest update will end this saga for good.\n\nFeature image Francesco Pecoraro via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The Leasing.com Stadium hosts a historic FA Cup encounter on Monday night as National League North side Macclesfield look to claim another high-profile scalp against Premier League high-flyers Brentford.\n\nThe Silkmen arrive in scintillating form, having secured six wins from their last seven league games while netting a remarkable 22 goals in that span. John Rooney’s side has already etched its name into competition folklore this season by eliminating holders Crystal Palace in the third round—the biggest upset in FA Cup history by league position.\n\nStanding in their way is a Brentford team that has defied preseason expectations to sit seventh in the top flight. Fresh from a hard-fought 1–1 draw with leaders Arsenal on Thursday, the Bees aim to navigate a “trap” fixture and reach the fifth round for only the second time in 19 seasons.\n\nVenue: Leasing.com Stadium, Macclesfield\n\nJohn Rooney remains without star forward Danny Elliott due to a knee injury. Midfielder Josh Kay is also unavailable as he serves a suspension for accumulating yellow cards. The Silkmen will rely on the attacking prowess of D’Mani Mellor, who has scored seven goals in his last seven outings, and former Manchester City prospect Isaac Buckley-Ricketts.\n\nKeith Andrews is expected to rotate his squad following a demanding week in the Premier League. Talisman Igor Thiago is likely to be rested, potentially handing a debut to 19-year-old Kaye Furo. Captain Nathan Collins could return to the starting XI after being an unused substitute in recent matches. Kevin Schade remains sidelined through suspension, while Fábio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries from long-term injuries.\n\nThe Silkmen have turned the Moss Rose into a fortress, taking 33 points from a possible 48 at home this season. Notably, Macclesfield have won three consecutive FA Cup matches this term. If they secure a win tonight, they would be the first team to win four in their debut season (from the first round) since Rangers in 1886. Their attack remains clinical, averaging over three goals per game in their last seven league matches.\n\nThe Bees arrive as heavy favourites but must overcome a difficult non-league test. Notably, top-flight teams have progressed from 26 of 28 FA Cup fourth-round ties against non-league opponents. This is Brentford’s first-ever FA Cup match as a top-flight side against non-league opposition. Despite a demanding schedule, Brentford have shown defensive resilience, keeping a clean sheet in their 2–0 third-round win over Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nMacclesfield Predicted XI: Dearnley; Fensome, Menayese, Heathcote, Lacey; Edmondson, Dawson, Duffy, Buckley-Ricketts; Bughail-Mellor, Mellor\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Valdimarsson; Hickey, Collins, Pinnock, Henry; Yarmolyuk, Henderson, Damsgaard; Donovan, Furo, Nelson\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports 1 and TNT Sports Ultimate.

    "fullText": "Brentford travel to face non-league Macclesfield on Monday night while they aim to avoid becoming the latest victim of the competition’s ultimate giant-killers.\n\nThe Bees moved into the top seven of the Premier League after a string of impressive results, including a recent 1–1 draw against leaders Arsenal. Manager Keith Andrews oversaw a comfortable 2–0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the third round to reach this stage. Notably, there are 122 league places between these two sides. A victory tonight would see Brentford reach the fifth round for only the second time in nearly two decades.\n\nKeith Andrews navigates a demanding schedule that necessitates rotation. Notably, he is likely to name talisman Igor Thiago among the substitutes to preserve fitness. Consequently, 19-year-old Kaye Furo is poised to lead the attack. This could mark his professional debut. Nathan Collins returns to the heart of the defence after a period on the bench. Conversely, Kevin Schade misses out through suspension. Long-term absentees Fábio Carvalho and Josh Dasilva also remain unavailable.\n\nHakon Valdimarsson starts in goal. He provides Caoimhín Kelleher a well-earned rest after recent Premier League heroics. Nathan Collins partners Ethan Pinnock in a formidable central defensive pairing. In midfield, Yehor Yarmolyuk and Jordan Henderson control the tempo alongside Mikkel Damsgaard. Further forward, Romelle Donovan and Reiss Nelson provide the threat from wide areas. Notably, Brentford have never faced non-league opposition as a top-flight side in the FA Cup.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Valdimarsson; Hickey, Collins, Pinnock, Henry; Yarmolyuk, Henderson, Damsgaard; Donovan, Furo, Nelson\n\nThe FA Cup fourth-round tie takes place at the Leasing.com Stadium on Monday, 16 February 2026.

    "description": "Neuer will now be out for at least three weeks for FC Bayern.",
    "fullText": "Unfortunately, it looks like Bayern Munich will have to go without captain Manuel Neuer for a considerable spell as his calf injury sustained in the 3-0 win at Werder Bremen was worse than initially expected. The club has confirmed that the keeper tore a muscle fiber in his left calf after a thorough exam from the club’s medical staff, though during the second half of the match and immediately following the final whistle, it was felt that Jonas Urbig entering the match to start the second half was more of just a precaution from Vincent Kompany.\n\nNow, per information from Sky Germany, Neuer is expected to be sidelined for at least three weeks (via @iMiaSanMia). During his three-week absence, Neuer will miss matches against Eintracht Frankfurt, Borussia Dortmund, and potentially even the matches against Borussia Mönchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen. Jonas Urbig will stand firm in Neuer’s absence, which there can be reassurance with given how solid he has performed when he’s been called upon by Kompany.\n\nSo far this season, Urbig has made a total of eight appearances across all competitions. From those eight matches, seven of them were wins, and only one was a loss; the shock 2-1 home loss to FC Augsburg. Additionally, from those other seven appearances that were wins, Urbig recorded four clean sheets, including the 45 minute shift this past weekend at Werder Bremen. To say the least, Bayern’s keeper situation is in good hands in Neuer’s absence, pun intended.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Former Chelsea defender Jason Cundy believes that Joao Pedro is the ‘most improved’ player under Liam Rosenior so far.\n\nI don’t think there would be many who would disagree with that statement either, even if quite a few of the players have improved a lot under the new Chelsea head coach.\n\nPedro has truly been on fire in the last few weeks, leading the line superbly and coming up with some very important goals too.\n\nChelsea paid £60 million to sign the 24-year-old from Brighton last summer and Pedro has gone on to bag 13 goals already this season. The striker has four goals and four assists in his last five Premier League outings and is really stepping up as the main man up top for Rosenior right now.\n\nJoao Pedro scored his lovely chip against Leeds. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking on talkSPORT, Cundy admitted that he had not expected to see the striker’s growth so quickly since the turn of the year.\n\nCundy said: “I think he’s probably been the most improved. I genuinely feel that his game has developed since Liam has come in. I don’t know whether that’s down to Liam or if it just coincides with Joao Pedro learning how to play that role better. His hold-up play is something I feel that he didn’t quite have because that’s a hard role.\n\n“The number nine up front on your own, that’s a tough job. Players are now trusting him. When that ball goes in, it bounces off… like Frank Lampard used to do with Didier Drogba. That ball goes in, he knows it’s sticking and will time his run. There’s an element of that going on, we look far more fluid. At the moment, Chelsea’s best number nine is Joao Pedro and I wouldn’t have said three months ago that he would be this player. Hats off, he’s really developed. And he runs in behind as well!”\n\nChelsea have reportedly laid down the most groundwork alongside Liverpool to try and sign Nottingham Forest centre back Murillo in the summer transfer window, with the defender now looking to leave his club.\n\nChelsea also have been linked with Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. His stats are great, but at his age and price it’s just not a deal we can see happening.",

    "description": "In a weekend of noise, one man chose silence. In a game of stars, Kawhi Leonard star chose to shine brightest.",
    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The lights of the Intuit Dome found him, as they always do.\n\nNot the strobes. Not the pyrotechnics. Not the manufactured glare of Red Panda, mascots and sponsored distractions.\n\nThe real lights. The ones that matter. The ones that follow greatness like paparazzi follow scandal.\n\nKawhi Leonard stood at midcourt, and the Intuit Dome held its breath.\n\nIt had been a weekend of experiments, of round-robin rubrics and compressed clocks, of three teams where two once stood.\n\nThe NBA, in its infinite tinkering, had fractured its showcase into fragments—12-minute bursts, a tournament where mathematics mattered as much as magic.\n\nNBA fans asked for competition. What they initially received was contention.\n\nThen came Victor Wembanyama. Then came De'Aaron Fox. And then, in the third game, when the afternoon had begun to sag under the weight of its own novelty, came Kawhi Leonard.\n\nHe made it must-watch. Leonard made the All-Star game matter, even as it has become a serious point of contention among those who watch.\n\nThe tone arrived early. It arrived tall.\n\nWembanyama set the tone in the first game of the round-robin tournament, and he set it with the casual ferocity of a man who has never learned to pretend.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs' dexterous 7-foot-4ish center—elastic, impossible, a Gumby-esque monument to modern basketball evolution—walked onto the court, and immediately made it clear he hadn't come for the photo ops.\n\nWemby looked to be taking the All-Star Game seriously.\n\nHe's played defense in an All-Star Game.\n\nIn the first round of a made-for-TV tournament that most players treat as a glorified shootaround. He starts off blocking shots and dunking on people. He came to play.\n\n\"I'm matched up on you,\" Wembanyama told Anthony Edwards in the tunnel before they took the court, according to Edwards.\n\nThe Frenchman finished with 14 points, six rebounds and three blocks in that opening tilt, numbers that tell nothing of the story.\n\nWembanyama contested everything. He erased shots that shooters believed were open. He moved like a guard in a center's body, like a thought in physical form, and his teammates—international stars accustomed to the All-Star's polite indifference—followed his lead.\n\n\"It's a game we love, it's a game I personally cherish,\" Wembanyama said. \"Being competitive is the least I can do.\"\n\nThe World team pushed Team Stars to overtime. Edwards scored 13 points, including a game-tying 3 to force the extra session.\n\nScottie Barnes eventually buried a game-winning triple—the first team to five points, because everything about this format required explanation—and Wembanyama stormed to the bench in disgust.\n\nThe same fury he wears in San Antonio when rotations break down, when possessions are wasted, when excellence is betrayed by inattention. He had lost. But he had established the standard.\n\n\"[Wembanyama] set the tone, and it was definitely competitive with all three teams,\" Edwards said. \"He set the tone, man. And it woke me up, for sure. I'm not gonna lie. He came out playing hard, so it's hard not to match that. So, [expletive], that's what happened. Sorry for my language; that's what happened, though.\"\n\nWembanyama's wake-up call reverberated into Game 2, where Team Stripes faced Team Stars with a different energy—veteran American talent against young American talent, experience versus exuberance, the past reaching for the future's throat.\n\nJaylen Brown poured in 11 points for Stripes. Edwards matched him. Cade Cunningham added 11 for Stars. The score tightened, twisted, refused to break.\n\nThe San Antonio guard—Wembanyama's teammate, though they played on opposite sides in this strange format—took possession with seconds remaining and found himself staring at Cade Cunningham.\n\nWhat happened next defied easy description, but let's try:\n\nFox put Cunningham in the popcorn machine.\n\nCrossed him, cooked him, left him standing in a different zip code. The buzzer sounded. The ball floated through the air. The net snapped.\n\nStripes 42, Stars 40. Game over. Fox's dagger was still quivering in the hardwood.\n\nThat's what the fans wanted to see.\n\nCompetition had crashed the party uninvited. And the party was better for it.\n\nThe experimental format—three teams, 12-minute games, a round-robin tournament and a final championship—had actually worked.\n\nPlayers competed. Crowds reacted. The millionaires and billionaires in attendance forgot to check their phones.\n\nThen the Leonard showcase happened.\n\nThe Clippers' forward, added to the All-Star Game as an injury replacement—inserted by commissioner Adam Silver like a late substitution in a play no one expected to succeed—caught fire in ways that defy statistical comprehension.\n\nIn the third game, Leonard nearly outscored Team World in 12 minutes. Kawhi-31, World 45.\n\nThe arithmetic reads like poetry. The performance played like prophecy.\n\nLeonard shot 84 percent from the field to lead Team Stripes to a 48-45 thriller, and he did so with the aesthetic minimalism that has defined his career—no wasted motion, no excess, nothing that did not serve the singular purpose of putting the ball through the hoop and preventing the opponent from doing the same.\n\nEleven for thirteen from the field. Six for seven from three. Three rebounds. Two steals. 84 percent shooting against a Wembanyama—the human eraser, the league's leading shot-blocker, a 7-foot-4 nightmare who tried his best and watched Leonard shoot over him anyway.\n\nHe looked like Kawhi Jordan, and for 12 minutes, the comparison felt not hyperbolic but historical.\n\n\"We were watching it ... like, 'Damn, this guy is killing,'\" Barnes recalled. \"We were just like in awe. In shock, too. When a guy has it going like that, it's special. That's what the people want to see.\"\n\nEdwards, waiting for the final game, approached Leonard with a message delivered through laughter and competitive terror: \"I told him when we walked out for the last game, I said, 'Hey, you need to chill out.'\"\n\nHe did not chill out. He could not. This is not what Kawhi Leonard does.\n\nThe Clippers fans—his fans, his city, his house—chanted MVP as the final seconds bled away.\n\nLeonard received four MVP votes despite losing the tournament, a statistical paradox that captures the essence of his art: individual transcendence in collective defeat, beauty in the losing effort, greatness recognized even when greatness is not enough.\n\nThe postgame podium found Leonard as it always does—measured, monotone, mysteriously compelling.\n\nThe voice, barely rising above a whisper, somehow commands complete attention. The man who eschews social media's circus has mastered the older art of saying everything by saying almost nothing.\n\n\"It's been fun,\" Leonard said. \"They always do a great job, even during our games, of just keeping us locked in and giving us energy throughout the whole 48 minutes. Los Angeles has been great.\"\n\nForty-eight minutes. Leonard spoke of regular-season endurance in a weekend of abbreviated bursts, revealing the mental framework that separates the professional from the performer.\n\nFor him, the All-Star Game was not an exception to be managed but an extension of identity—compete, always; defend, always; remain, always, the version of himself that arrived in Los Angeles as a champion and persists as a standard.\n\n\"Happy that Adam let me in,\" Leonard said, the two-time Finals MVP, requiring permission to participate in a showcase of stars. \"That's what the home crowd wanted to see and I'm glad I was able to do something in that game.\"\n\nSomething. Thirty-one points in twelve minutes is not something.\n\nIt is everything compressed into urgency, the career-long narrative of efficiency taken to its logical extreme.\n\nA reporter asked about reaching \"Flow State\" in front of home fans. Leonard demurred with characteristic indirection: \"It's great, you know. Happy that Adam let me in.\"\n\nThe deflection is the message. The silence is the statement.\n\nWhen another journalist noted that scoring 31 in a regular game is crazy—\"obviously, Klay had the 37 in one quarter, but for you to do it against World All-Stars, does that mean anything different?\"—Leonard responded with the perspective of a man who has seen everything and been impressed by little.\n\n\"No, just having fun out there. Making shots. Obviously, these guys aren't competing at a regular-season schedule game, but it's always fun to go out and compete against those guys. Cherish the court with them. They're all legends, and they're playing great basketball.\"\n\nOn the format—this experimental triptych of teams and timers—Leonard offered the wisdom of a man who has seen basketball's evolution from defense-first grind to offense-only spectacle and back again: \"I think it was good. Didn't really figure it out till we got here. Even as the game is going on, trying to figure out the records, how you play that out, point spread, or what. But I thought it was good. I still think going back to East-West will be great—I think guys will compete still.\"\n\nThe competitors, he suggested, make the competition.\n\nNot the structure. Not the stakes. The will.\n\nWhen I asked the inevitable—\"When you're healthy, are you the best player in the league?\"—Leonard responded with the philosophy that has carried him through injury and triumph, through San Antonio's betrayal and Toronto's redemption, through the Clippers' endless promise and perpetual postponement:\n\n\"It's for you guys. For me, I think it's rotation—every day, every week, because you get guys coming out scoring 50, having great defensive games, and then the next night somebody's not playing well, somebody else is going to shine. So, for me, I think the ranking is just based on you just keeping the hype around the game.\"\n\nHe paused. The room leaned forward.\n\n\"But yeah, I feel like I'm one of the best at when I am playing basketball.\"\n\nOne of the best. The understatement is the point. Humility is the armor.\n\nAnother voice emerged from the presser: \"Kawhi, in that game, obviously you're representing your home court and you're a local guy. Did you have an extra sense of motivation?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I grew up coming up here watching, going to the convention center, seeing stars walk around and dreaming of being here,\" Leonard said. \"I wanted to take the opportunity to play great, and I take advantage of it and go out there and ball. I was happy I was able to do that this year in LA.\"\n\nThe final question turned to the locker room mindset, the pregame conversation about competitiveness after years of criticism.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Leonard said. \"We didn't really mention not playing hard or let's make this competitive. I didn't hear anything. We just went out there and competed. We wanted to win the game. We got competitors out there, and we got some championship pedigree. It's hard to turn off that switch when you're out there playing.\"\n\nThe championship game—Team Stars versus Team Stripes arrived as anticlimax.\n\nThe young Americans won 47-21, a blowout that rendered the tournament's mathematics moot.\n\nEdwards scored eight points on 3-for-5 shooting and collected his trophy, receiving 10 of 14 MVP votes. Leonard managed one point on 0-for-4 shooting, his body perhaps reminding him that even machines require maintenance, that 31 points in 12 minutes extracts its tax.\n\nIt didn't matter. The damage was done. The statement was made.\n\nKevin Durant, who has seen every iteration of All-Star weekend over two decades, delivered the verdict.\n\n\"I think it was definitely a step up in the competitive department compared to last season. Kawhi was great. Ant was great. I think we did what we're supposed to do for the fans,\" Durant said.\n\nWhat they were supposed to do. The phrase carries weight.\n\nFor too many All-Star weekends, the obligation has been entertainment without effort, spectacle without stakes.\n\nSunday in Inglewood offered something rarer: the genuine article, the unscripted collision of wills, the reminder that even in exhibition, excellence insists upon itself.\n\nWembanyama began it. Fox complicated it. Leonard, in the third game, when the afternoon had begun to drift toward irrelevance, made it must-watch—made it matter, made it memorable.\n\nEdwards, asked postgame about the format, credited the Frenchman who started everything.\n\n\"I think it makes us compete because it's only 12-minute games, and the three different teams separate the guys. I think it was really good,\" Edwards said.\n\nLeonard, asked whether the new format should stay, offered a diplomat's answer.\n\n\"Whatever you guys want. Whatever grabs the attention of the consumer, I'm for it,\" Leonard said.\n\nBut pressed again on returning to tradition, he allowed a small concession.\n\n\"I still think going back to East-West will be great. I think guys will compete still,\" Leonard said.\n\nMaybe Wembanyama's example—his refusal to treat All-Star minutes as downtime, his insistence on playing defense in a game designed for offense—will linger.\n\nPerhaps Fox's dagger, Leonard's clinic, and Edwards's Kobe Bryanttrophy will combine into something lasting, something more than a one-year experiment that worked despite everyone's expectations.\n\nOr maybe it was just one afternoon. One 12-minute window where a quiet superstar reminded everyone what he looks like when the switch flips.\n\nThe lights found him, as they always do.\n\nNot the strobes. Not the pyrotechnics. Not the manufactured glare of halftime shows and sponsored distractions.\n\nThe real lights. The ones that matter. The ones that follow greatness like memory follows meaning.\n\nKawhi Leonard stood at midcourt, and the Intuit Dome held its breath.\n\nFor 12 minutes, he kept it from falling.\n\nMade it forget the compressed clocks, the sordid recent history of All-Star Weekned and the round-robin confusion. Made it remember why we watch, why we care, why a game played by millionaires in February can still feel like the only thing in the world worth seeing.\n\nFor the first time in years, the game itself felt like enough.",

    "description": "OKC Thunder forward Chet Holmgren made his first NBA All-Star Game appearance on Sunday, and he helped his team win a tournament title.",
    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, CA — The sound of a television could be heard from a hallway inside Intuit Dome on Sunday night.\n\nIt came from a small visitors' locker room, where the USA Stars team was watching a broadcast of the NBA All-Star Game's round-robin tournament. The USA Stripes and World teams were facing off, and the outcome would decide if the Stars advanced to the championship round.\n\nTyrese Maxey drank some \"Cool Blue\" Gatorade on one side of the room. Jalen Johnson ate some chicken tenders from concessions on the other. And in the center was Chet Holmgren, who only wanted to feast his eyes on the TV and see if his first career All-Star appearance would continue.\n\n\"I think that's the one thing that's tough about having a three-team, team-off-and-team-on thing,\" Holmgren said of the event's new tournament format. \"We went back in the locker room for like 20 or 30 minutes while the other two teams were playing. We were kind of just chilling, sitting there and watching it.\"\n\nNBA All-Star Game highlights: Chet Holmgren, USA Stars win championship\n\nFortunately, Holmgren's night wasn't over. The World team lost, sending the Stars to the championship round thanks to a head-to-head tiebreaker. They then secured the title by earning a dominant 47-21 win over the Stripes.\n\nThe Thunder big man came off the bench during all three of his team's 12-minute games. It's a feeling that's unfamiliar to the 23-year-old pro, who has always been one of the brightest stars on every court he's touched.\n\nBut Holmgren stayed true to his usual brand of basketball, impacting the game on both ends while playing within the team. He racked up eight points, two rebounds and a game-high two blocks on 3-for-4 shooting from the field during the title game. And he did so in only six minutes.\n\n\"I think it was great,\" Holmgren said. \"Before, I didn't really know how it was supposed to go because I'd never gone through it. I was just kind of trying to feel out the game and play accordingly, and I think it went well. It was fun. ... I played a good brand of basketball.\"\n\nSunday's tournament isn't the biggest stage Holmgren has stepped onto. He helped OKC win its first NBA championship in franchise history last season, after all.\n\nStill, Holmgren couldn't help but to appreciate his surroundings as he got some 3s up during shootaround.\n\nStars such as Minnesota's Anthony Edwards and Detroit's Cade Cunningham are usually on the other end of the court. The side that's enemy territory. But they were right next to him this time, letting it fly and doing some pregame stretches.\n\nMore: Chet Holmgren's path to NBA All-Star Game began with bold claim and channeled ambition\n\n\"I just tried to take a moment to reflect on how cool of an opportunity this is,\" Holmgren said. \"I felt like I was pretty in the moment for the most part, just taking everything in.\"\n\nHolmgren took in plenty of other cool moments throughout the weekend.\n\nHe attended a Foot Locker event on Friday, where he held a sit-down interview and a meet-and-greet with fans. He participated in the Shooting Stars competition on Saturday, where he teamed up with Toronto's Scottie Barnes and former NBA player Richard Hamilton. And he even received a ring before Sunday's tournament to commemorate his All-Star selection.\n\nHolmgren says he didn't even know that last part was going to happen. But he'll happily add it to his growing collection of hardware.\n\n\"It's pretty sick, but I think I like our ring from last summer a little bit more,\" Holmgren said with a smirk.\n\nMore: OKC Thunder's Jared McCain responds to Jason Williams' criticism: 'Get to know me'\n\nJustin Martinez covers the Thunder and NBA for The Oklahoman.

    "fullText": "Manchester United have made an impressive start to 2026.\n\nThey have won seven matches in a row across four different competitions. The latest was an edgy 2-1 win over the London City Lionesses.\n\nManager Marc Skinner spoke to The BBC after the match and outlined his joy at his side winning ugly.\n\nCommenting on the result, he said, “to use a Manchester term, I’m absolutely buzzing. I’m so happy for the team and everyone behind the scenes, but particularly the players.”\n\nThe head coach also opened up on the difficulty of maintaining this winning run with so many matches in such a short period.\n\nHe elaborated, “it’s not easy to come off the pitch that we played on mid-week [against Atletico Madrid], get back at 4am and produce a winning performance today.”\n\nSkinner explained, “London City made it very difficult for us, but I just believe this team will always find a way.”\n\nUnited played particularly poorly by their high standards and managed only two shots on target in the entire match.\n\nThey also faced another injury concern with Jayde Riviere, having already lost Anna Sandberg in Madrid.\n\nCommenting on the problems his side faced, he added, “the amount of challenges we had in the game… I put [midfielder] Lisa Naalsund in about seven different positions.”\n\nHe also argued that his side were missing their usual energy and cohesion. Not for the first time this year, he praised his squad depth, claiming the players he brought on “were incredible”.\n\nSkinner concluded, “we just needed to get through today – we really did. The most successful teams in the country have done it for many years. Chelsea have definitely done that. We can mix our style and what you saw today was just a special spirit in the group. They never give up.”\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Liverpool are finally looking to replace Luis Diaz. However, this one is a £100m risk.\n\nLiverpool controversially sold Luis Diaz without a replacement in the summer. The Reds did take in a lot of money for the Colombian - but didn’t spend it on a new winger.\n\nAnd that created a huge problem. Liverpool were near-reliant on Diaz to be the forward who consistently attacked defenders one-v-one and broke the lines that way.\n\nWithout him, Liverpool just don’t have that kind of player. Rio Ngumoha isn’t quite ready and no one else in the squad offers that kind of direct running.\n\nIt’s a problem Arne Slot has voiced this season. “You always miss good players,” Slot said of Díaz this week, per the Telegraph. “He was so important for us last season.\"\n\nWell, it appears Liverpool are taking action to find that replacement. It’s a risky one, though.\n\nCaught Offside reports that Liverpool are looking at Anthony Gordon in a deal that could reach around £95m. Now, whether Newcastle United are willing to deal with the Reds is another matter - but there's strong interest from Anfield.\n\nIn fact, the report claims Liverpool lead the race here. They appear certain he’s the one for them, going back in for Gordon two years after they initially looked to sign him.\n\nIt would make Gordon the replacement on the left for Diaz. A direct winger who likes to consistently run forward with the ball, attack defenders and get the ball in the box.",

    "description": "Tech titans pour $50 million into super PAC to elect AI-friendly candidates to Congress",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names behind the artificial intelligence boom are looking to stack Congress with allies who support lighter regulation of the emerging technology by drawing on the crypto industry’s 2024 election success.\n\nMarc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman are among tech leaders who’ve poured $50 million into a new super political action committee to help AI-friendly candidates prevail in November’s congressional races. Known as Leading the Future, the super PAC has taken center stage as voters grow increasingly concerned that AI risks driving up energy costs and taking away jobs.\n\nAs it launches operations, Leading the Future is deploying a strategy that worked two years ago for crypto advocates: talk about what’s likely to resonate with voters, not the industry or its interests and controversies. For AI, that means its ads won’t tout the technology but instead discuss core issues including economic opportunity and immigration — even if that means not mentioning AI at all.\n\n“They’re trying to be helpful in a campaign rather than talking about their own issue all the time,” said Craig Murphy, a Republican political consultant in Texas, where Leading the Future has backed Chris Gober, an ally of President Trump, in the state’s hotly contested 10th congressional district.\n\nThis year, the group plans to spend up to $125 million on candidates who favor a single, national approach to AI regulation, regardless of party affiliation. The election comes at a crucial moment for the industry as it invests hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure that will put fresh strains on resources, with new data centers already blamed for driving up utility bills.\n\nLeading the Future faces a growing challenge from AI safety advocates, who’ve started their own super PAC called Public First with a goal of raising $50 million for candidates who favor stricter oversight. On Thursday, Public First landed a $20-million pledge from Anthropic PBC, a rival to OpenAI that has set itself apart from other AI companies by supporting tougher rules.\n\nPolls show deepening public concern over AI’s impact on everything from jobs to education to the environment. Sixty-two percent of US adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week, and 58% are concerned the government will not go far enough in regulating it, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nJesse Hunt, a Leading the Future spokesman, said the group is “committed to supporting policymakers who want a smart national regulatory framework for AI,” one that boosts US employment while winning the race against China. Hunt said the super PAC backs ways to protect consumers “without ceding America’s technological future to extreme ideological gatekeepers.”\n\nThe political and economic stakes are enormous for OpenAI and others behind Leading the Future, including venture capitalists Andreessen and Horowitz. Their firm, a16z, is the richest in Silicon Valley with billions of dollars invested in AI upstarts including coding startup Cursor and AI leaderboard platform LM Arena.\n\nFor now, their super PAC is doing most of the talking for the AI industry in the midterm races. Meta Platforms Inc. has announced plans for AI-related political spending on state-level contests, with $20 million for its California-based super PAC and $45 million for its American Technology Excellence Project, according to Politico.\n\nOther companies with massive AI investment plans — Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — have their own corporate PACs to dole out bipartisan federal campaign donations. Nvidia Corp., the chip giant driving AI policy in Washington, doesn’t have its own PAC.\n\nTo ensure consistent messaging across party lines, Leading the Future has created two affiliated super PACs — one spending on Republicans and another on Democrats. The aim is to build a bipartisan coalition that can be effective in Washington regardless of which party is in power.\n\nTexas, home of OpenAI’s massive Stargate project, is one of the states where Leading the Future has already jumped in. Its Republican arm, American Mission, has spent nearly $750,000 on ads touting Gober, a political lawyer who’s previously worked for Elon Musk’s super PAC and is in a crowded GOP primary field for an open House seat.\n\nThe ads hail Gober as a “MAGA warrior” who “will fight for Texas families, lowering everyday costs.” Gober’s campaign website lists “ensuring America’s AI dominance” as one of his top campaign priorities. Gober’s campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn New York, Leading the Future’s Democratic arm, Think Big, has spent $1.1 million on television ads and messages attacking Alex Bores, a New York state assemblyman who has called for tougher AI safety protocols and is now running for an open congressional seat encompassing much of central Manhattan.\n\nThe ads seize on Democrats’ revulsion over Trump’s immigration crackdown and target Bores for his work at Palantir Technologies Inc., which contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Think Big has circulated mailings and text messages citing Bores’ work with Palantir, urging voters to “Reject Bores’ hypocrisy on ICE.”\n\nIn an interview, Bores called the claims in the ads false, explaining that he left Palantir because of its work with ICE. He pointed out the irony that Joe Lonsdale, a Palantir co-founder who’s backed the administration’s border crackdown, is a donor to Leading the Future.\n\n“They’re not being ideologically consistent,” Bores said. “The fact that they have been so transparent and said, ‘Hey, we’re the AI industry and Alex Bores will regulate AI and that scares us,’ has been nothing but a benefit so far.”\n\nLeading the Future’s Democratic arm also plans to spend seven figures to support Democrats in two Illinois congressional races: former Illinois Representatives Jesse Jackson Jr. and Melissa Bean.\n\nLeading the Future is following the path carved by Fairshake, a pro-cryptocurrency super PAC that joined affiliates in putting $133 million into congressional races in 2024. Fairshake made an early mark by spending $10 million to attack progressive Katie Porter in the California Democratic Senate primary, helping knock her out of the race in favor of Adam Schiff, the eventual winner who’s seen as more friendly to digital currency.\n\nThe group also backed successful primary challengers against House incumbents, including Democrats Cori Bush in Missouri and Jamaal Bowman in New York. Both were rated among the harshest critics of digital assets by the Stand With Crypto Alliance, an industry group.\n\nIn its highest-profile 2024 win, Fairshake spent $40 million to help Republican Bernie Moreno defeat incumbent Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, a crypto skeptic who led the Senate Banking Committee. Overall, it backed winners in 52 of the 61 races where it spent at least $100,000, including victories in three Senate and nine House battlegrounds.\n\nFairshake and Leading the Future share more than a strategy. Josh Vlasto, one of Leading the Future’s political strategists, does communications work for Fairshake. Andreessen and Horowitz are also among Fairshake’s biggest donors, combining to give $23.8 million last year.\n\nBut Leading the Future occasionally conflicts with Fairshake’s past spending. The AI group said Wednesday it plans to spend half a million dollars on an ad campaign for Laurie Buckhout, a former Pentagon official who’s seeking a congressional seat in North Carolina with calls to slash rules “strangling American innovation.” In 2024, during Buckhout’s unsuccessful run for the post, Fairshake spent $2.3 million supporting her opponent and eventual winner, Democratic Rep. Donald Davis.\n\n“The fact that they tried to replay the crypto battle means that we have to engage,” said Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Texas who helped launch Public First. “I’d say Leading the Future was the forcing function.”\n\nUnlike crypto, proponents of stricter AI regulations have backers within the industry. Even before its contribution to Public First, Anthropic had pressed for “responsible AI” with sturdier regulations for the fast-moving technology and opposed efforts to preempt state laws.\n\nAnthropic employees have also contributed to candidates targeted by Leading the Future, including a total of $168,500 for Bores, Federal Election Commission records show. A super PAC Dream NYC, whose only donor in 2025 was an Anthropic machine learning researcher who gave $50,000, is backing Bores as well.\n\nCarson, who’s co-leading the super PAC with former Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah, cites public polling that more than 80% of US adults believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, and says voter sentiment is on Public First’s side.\n\nPublic First didn’t disclose receiving any donations last year, according to FEC filings. But one of the group’s affiliated super PACs, Defend our Values PAC, reported receiving $50,000 from Public First Action Inc., the group’s advocacy arm. The PAC hasn’t yet spent any of that money on candidates.\n\nCrypto’s clout looms large in lawmakers’ memory, casting a shadow over any effort to regulate the big tech companies, said Doug Calidas, head of government affairs for AI safety group Americans for Responsible Innovation.\n\n“Fairshake was just so effective,” said Calidas, whose group has called for tougher AI regulations. “Democrats and Republicans are scared they’re going to replicate that model.”\n\nAllison and Birnbaum write for Bloomberg.",

    "description": "Farmers depend on healthy crops for their livelihoods.",
    "fullText": "Florida's orange harvest is expected to be the smallest since 1930 because of major declines in healthy trees, affecting both farmers and consumers across the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to Insurance Journal, which cited data from the Department of Agriculture, the state will have an estimated output of 12 million boxes of oranges this season — a 2% decline compared to last season.\n\nSince around 2000, Florida's orange groves have been shrinking because of a devastating, incurable bacterial infection called citrus greening disease, which kills tree roots and stunts growth. The disease causes fruits to be smaller, greener, and bitter, making them essentially unsellable.\n\nRapid urban development has also led to the removal of many orange groves, and damage from intense hurricanes — for example, Ian, Nicole, and Milton — since 2022 has further destroyed trees.\n\nInsurance Journal reported that treatments have helped some trees recover, but that hasn't been enough to restore yields to their former levels.\n\n\"It'll be a process to see the overall fruit count increase,\" Matt Joyner, CEO of Florida Citrus Mutual, told the news outlet. \"That's going to take a number of years to get that broader number up.\"\n\nFarmers depend on healthy crops for their livelihoods, but the financial strain from poor harvests has forced many out of business, according to WUSF. Remaining farmers are frustrated by the lack of breakthroughs in research to combat the disease as well as by other losses due to worsening storms and erratic weather.\n\nFood and Wine reported that hurricanes have been especially brutal in the Sunshine State since 2020, reflecting the impact of rising global temperatures on orange yields.\n\n\"It can take up to three to five years for a damaged tree to recover from an extreme weather event (if it survives at all) and return to peak production,\" Marisa Zansler, the Florida Department of Citrus' director of economic and market research, told the magazine.\n\nSmaller harvests usually mean more expensive grocery prices, though Insurance Journal reported that orange juice futures have dropped significantly as Brazil, the world's top orange exporter, expects a major boost in production.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nRecent cold snaps and hurricanes have also resulted in millions of dollars in losses for vegetable, potato, melon, and strawberry farmers throughout Florida.\n\nAccording to WUSF, Florida lawmakers are working to pass a bill that would reduce the minimum sugar content required for orange juice, the end product for much of the state's harvests. Fresh oranges in grocery stores are more likely to come from California, and the USDA predicts a high output from the state this year, which should stabilize prices.\n\nScientists have also been experimenting with genetically modified orange trees that can withstand or resist citrus greening. They say it could be the breakthrough the industry needs to stay afloat amid rising production costs and increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather.\n\nKeeping tabs on how the climate impacts orange harvests will help you know what to expect at the grocery store and shop smarter.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian drone strike ignited fires at one of Russia’s Black Sea ports, officials said Sunday, ahead of fresh talks aimed at ending the nearly 4-year-old war.\n\nTwo people were wounded in the attack on the port of Taman in the Krasnodar region, which damaged an oil storage tank, warehouse and terminals, according to regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev.\n\nMeanwhile, falling debris from Russian drones damaged civilian and transport infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa region, officials said, causing disruption to the power and water supply.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nThe attacks came ahead of another round of U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva, just before the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested there were still questions remaining over future security guarantees for his country. Zelenskyy also questioned how the concept of a free trade zone — proposed by the U.S. — would work in the Donbas region, which Russia insists Kyiv must give up for peace.\n\nHe said the Americans want peace as quickly as possible and that the U.S. team wants to sign all the agreements on Ukraine at the same time, whereas Ukraine wants guarantees for the country’s future security signed first.\n\nZelenskyy’s concerns were echoed by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a ranking member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n“Unless we have real security guarantees on whatever peace agreement is ultimately determined, we are going to be here again, because one of the things we know is that Russia has geared up not just for Ukraine, but to go beyond Ukraine,” she told reporters in Munich on Sunday.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia was hoping to win diplomatically what it had failed to achieve on the battlefield, and was banking on the U.S. to deliver concessions at the negotiating table. But Kallas told the Munich conference Sunday that key Russian demands — including the lifting of sanctions and unfreezing of assets — were decisions for Europe.\n\n“If we want a sustainable peace then we need concessions also from the Russian side,” she said.\n\nPrevious U.S.-led efforts to find consensus on ending the war, most recently two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have failed to resolve difficult issues, such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland that is largely occupied by Russian forces.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Officials in Minnesota made a worrying discovery in a lake outside St. Paul, Minnesota, of zebra mussel larvae, one of the most pervasive threats to the waters of the Great Lakes region.\n\nOfficials with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) confirmed there are zebra mussel larvae in Tanners Lake in Landfall, Minn., according to a report from Pioneer Press. Samples showed 12 zebra mussel larvae, called veligers, present in the water.\n\n\"While the DNR has not found adult zebra mussels in Tanners Lake, the presence of veligers suggests reproducing zebra mussel populations,\" officials said in a statement. Due to their presence, Tanners Lake is now listed as \"infested with zebra mussels,\" per the department.\n\nMinnesota state law requires boaters, anglers, and those who own waterfront property to follow strict guidelines to prevent the spread of zebra mussels, regardless of whether a lake has an infestation.\n\nZebra mussels are an invasive species that can spread quickly. The MDNR notes that females can produce 100,000 to 500,000 eggs per year. After their veligers (fertilized eggs) form shells, they can attach themselves to surfaces, forming dense beds that can reach tens of thousands in a single square yard. They were first recorded in the Great Lakes region in 1988, believed to have been introduced through contaminated cargo ship ballast water.\n\nThe zebra mussels have caused major disruptions to the ecosystem, outcompeting native mussels and other species for resources and interfering with natural aquatic plant growth. For people, they can clog water intakes for power plants, encrust boats and other equipment, and cut swimmers' and pets' feet when they're attached to docks and rafts.\n\nMinnesota isn't the only state dealing with the headaches caused by the invasive species. Officials in Iowa recently discovered zebra mussels in the Des Moines River, part of their spread westward over the past few decades.\n\nThe MDNR encourages people to report the presence of zebra mussels in any body of water, regardless of whether there's a known infestation or not. They should also follow the department's guidelines on cleaning boats, properly disposing of bait, and drying vessels for 21 days before moving from one body of water to another.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday it completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, the latest effort by leader Kim Jong Un to honor the war dead.\n\nState media photos showed Kim Jong Un walking through the new street — called Saeppyol Street — and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, as he pledged to repay the “young martyrs” who “sacrificed all to their motherland.”\n\nIn recent months, North Korea has intensified propaganda glorifying troops deployed to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine, such as establishing a memorial wall and building a museum. Analysts see it as an effort to bolster internal unity and curb potential public discontent.\n\nKim in recent months has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, to fuel Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, as the leaders align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.\n\nSouth Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers last week it estimated 6,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded during their deployment in the war, but did not provide a breakdown of fatalities. The agency said last year it believed roughly 600 had died.\n\nThe spy agency believes North Korean forces are gaining modern combat experience and Russian technical support that could improve the performance of their weapons systems, according to lawmakers who attended last week’s closed-door briefing.\n\nThe construction of the new street comes as North Korea prepares to open a major ruling party congress later this month, where Kim is expected to announce his major goals in domestic and foreign policy over the next five years and take further steps to tighten his control.",

    "title": "Trump team offers its answer to rising premium costs: catastrophic coverage",
    "description": "The changes come as affordability is a key concern for many Americans, some of whom are struggling to pay their ACA premiums.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration has unveiled a sweeping set of regulatory proposals that would substantially change health plan offerings on the Affordable Care Act marketplace next year, aiming, it says, to provide more choice and lower premiums. But it also proposes sharply raising some annual out-of-pocket costs — to more than $27,000 for one type of coverage — and could cause up to 2 million people to drop insurance.\n\nThe changes come as affordability is a key concern for many Americans, some of whom are struggling to pay their ACA premiums since enhanced subsidies expired at the end of last year. Initial enrollment numbers for this year fell by more than 1 million.\n\nHealth care coverage and affordability have become politically potent issues in the run-up to November’s midterm elections.\n\nThe proposed changes are part of a lengthy rule that addresses a broad swath of standards, including benefit packages, out-of-pocket costs, and health care provider networks. Insurers refer to these standards when setting premium rates for the coming year.\n\nAfter a comment period, the rule will be finalized this spring.\n\nIt “puts patients, taxpayers, and states first by lowering costs and reinforcing accountability for taxpayer dollars,” said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz in a Feb. 9 press release.\n\nOne way it would do so focuses heavily on a type of coverage — catastrophic plans — that last year attracted only about 20,000 policyholders, according to the proposal, although other estimates put it closer to 54,000.\n\n“To me, this proposal reads like the administration has found their next big thing in the catastrophic plans,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nSuch plans have very high annual out-of-pocket costs for the policyholder but often lower premiums than other ACA coverage options. Formerly restricted to those under age 30 or facing certain hardships, the Trump administration allowed older people who lost subsidy eligibility to enroll in them for this year. It is not yet known how many people chose to do so.\n\nThe payment rule cements this move by making eligible anyone whose income is below the poverty line ($15,650 for this year) and those earning more than 2.5 times that amount who lost access to an ACA subsidy that lowered their out-of-pocket costs. It also notes that a person meeting these standards would be eligible in any state — an important point because this coverage is currently available in only 36 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn addition, the proposal would require out-of-pocket maximums on such plans to hit $15,600 a year for an individual and $27,600 for a family, Keith wrote this week in Health Affairs. (The current out-of-pocket max for catastrophic plans is $10,600 for an individual plan and $21,200 for family coverage.) Not counting preventive care and three covered primary care doctor visits, that spending target must be met before a policy’s other coverage kicks in.\n\nIn the rule, the administration wrote that the proposed changes would help differentiate catastrophic from “bronze” plans, the next level up, and, possibly, spur more enrollment in the former. Currently, the proposal said, there may not be a significant difference if premiums are similar. Raising the out-of-pocket maximum for catastrophic plans to those levels would create that difference, the proposal said.\n\n“When there is such a clear difference, the healthier consumers that are generally eligible and best suited to enroll in catastrophic plans are more motivated to select a catastrophic plan in lieu of a bronze plan,” the proposal noted.\n\nHowever, ACA subsidies cannot be used toward catastrophic premiums, which could limit shoppers’ interest.\n\nEnrollment in bronze plans, which currently have an average annual deductible of $7,500, has doubled since 2018 to about 5.4 million last year. This year, that number will likely be higher. Some states’ sign-up data indicates a shift toward bronze as consumers left higher-premium “silver,” “gold,” or “platinum” plans following the expiration of more generous subsidies at the end of last year.\n\nThe proposal also would allow insurers to offer bronze plans with cost-sharing rates that exceed what the ACA law currently allows, but only if that insurer also sells other bronze plans with lower cost-sharing levels.\n\nIn what it calls a “novel” approach, the proposal would allow insurers to offer multiyear catastrophic plans, in which people could stay enrolled for up to 10 years, and their out-of-pocket maximums would vary over that time. Costs might be higher, for example, in the early years, then fall the longer the policy is in place. The proposal specifically asks for comments on how such a plan could be structured and what effect multiyear plans might have on the overall market.\n\n“As we understand it thus far, insurers could offer the policy for one year or for consecutive years, up to 10 years,” said Zach Sherman, managing director for coverage policy and program design at HMA, also known as Health Management Associates, a health policy consulting firm that does work for states and insurance plans. “But the details on how that would work, we are still unpacking.”\n\nMatthew Fiedler, senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, said the proposed rule included a lot of provisions that could “expose enrollees to much higher out-of-pocket costs.”\n\nIn addition to the planned changes to bronze and catastrophic plans, he points to another provision that would allow plans to be sold on the ACA exchange that have no set health care provider networks. In other words, the insurer has not contracted with specific doctors and hospitals to accept their coverage. Instead, such plans would pay medical providers a set amount toward medical services, possibly a flat fee or a percentage of what Medicare pays, for example. The rule says insurers would need to ensure “access to a range of providers” willing to accept such amounts as payment in full. Policyholders might be on the hook for unexpected expenses, however, if a clinician or facility doesn’t agree and charges the patient the difference.\n\nBecause the rule is so sweeping — with many other parts — it is expected to draw hundreds, if not thousands, of comments between now and early March.\n\nPennsylvania insurance broker Joshua Brooker said one change he would like to see is requiring insurers that sell the very high out-of-pocket catastrophic plans to offer other catastrophic plans with lower annual maximums.\n\nOverall, though, a wider range of options might appeal to people on both ends of the income scale, he said.\n\nSome wealthier enrollees, especially those who no longer qualify for any ACA premium subsidies, would prefer a lower premium like those expected in catastrophic plans, and could just pay the bills up to that max, he said.\n\n“They’re more worried about the half-million-dollar heart attack,” Brooker said. It’s tougher for people below the poverty level, who don’t qualify for ACA subsidies and, in 10 states, often don’t qualify for Medicaid. So they’re likely to go uninsured. At least a catastrophic plan, he said, might let them get some preventive care coverage and cap their exposure if they end up in a hospital. From there, they might qualify for charity care at the hospital to cover out-of-pocket costs.\n\nOverall, “putting more options on the market doesn’t hurt, as long as it is disclosed properly and the consumer understands it,” he said.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

Elon Musk replied: \"Most ironic outcome is most likely.\"\n\nBillie Eilish got me deported from the US - I think her legal team contacted DHS\n\nI spent 30 hours at LAX immigration trying to explain that my shit posts were just a joke and that I didn’t actually plan to personally move into her mansion\n\nHonestly… https://t.co/R4ynQEor3c pic.twitter.com/8eVCcBE5Jr\n\n— Drew Pavlou 🇦🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦🇹🇼 (@DrewPavlou) February 15, 2026\n\nHere's the thing — Pavlou isn't the first person to test what Eilish said. He's just the one who got on a plane. The list started growing the morning after the speech.\n\nWithin hours, people pointed out that her $2.3 million Glendale mansion sits on the ancestral land of the Tongva tribe — the Indigenous people of the greater Los Angeles Basin. They're not a historical footnote. They're an active tribe seeking federal recognition. A Tongva spokesperson confirmed to Newsweek that Eilish's home is \"situated in our ancestral land,\" and that she has never contacted them. Not before the speech. Not after. Not even a DM.\n\nThey added a request that's easy to miss and hard to forget — that people actually name the Tongva when talking about \"stolen land,\" instead of using the phrase as a blank slogan without specifying whose land it was.\n\nTwo days later, LA-based Sinai Law Firm offered on X to evict Eilish pro bono on behalf of the Tongva. Attorney Avi Sinai later told the New York Post the offer was satirical. But his follow-up had teeth: \"It's both empty virtue signaling and used as a weapon at the same time,\" he wrote. \"No elected official is giving the land back to the Tongva. Just like Billie Eilish is not going to get evicted nor will she give her house back.\"\n\nThen a GB News reporter drove to her Glendale mansion and stood at the gate. \"Billie, let us in, please. We are here because this is stolen land.\" The gate stayed closed. The property she called stolen was secured behind the kind of gate that suggests the person inside very much believes in property lines.\n\nSenators, cabinet secretaries, billionaires, Shark Tank hosts, the Hulk — all talking about Billie Eilish. The only person not talking about Billie Eilish was Billie Eilish.\n\nHer brother Finneas stepped in on Threads: \"Seeing a lot of very powerful old white men outraged about what my 24-year-old sister said during her acceptance speech. We can literally see your names in the Epstein files.\"\n\nThat was the closest thing to a response the Eilish camp has offered. Billie herself said nothing.\n\nHere's what Billie Eilish has said publicly since February 1: \"No one is illegal on stolen land. F--k ICE.\"\n\nThat's it — at least on this subject.\n\nSince then, the Tongva tribe confirmed she lives on their land. A law firm offered to evict her using her own words. A reporter showed up at her gate. A senator, a Shark Tank host, the DHS secretary, and the president all weighed in. And an Australian shitposter says he was deported — possibly with the help of the same immigration system she told the Grammys to go f--k itself.\n\nEilish has not clarified whether \"no one is illegal on stolen land\" applies to Tongva tribal members, Australian shitposters, or British reporters standing at her gate.\n\nThe gate, for the record, is still closed.",

    "fullText": "LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — She says she was let down at every step. By a partner who abandoned her when she was pregnant. By a health service that denied her a legal abortion. And by a justice system that sent her to a maximum-security prison for illegally terminating her pregnancy on her own.\n\nViolet Zulu, a house cleaner in Zambia earning $40 a month, was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2024 after representing herself in court with little understanding of the consequences of her actions. She didn't see her two children or other family members for nearly two years.\n\nAfter word of her case reached international rights groups that helped her file an appeal, Zulu was freed last month. Activists say she represents many women in Africa who take desperate decisions when facing barriers to legal abortion services.\n\nHer story has drawn little sympathy in her southern African nation, where parts of society view abortion harshly. Her own mother said she agreed with her daughter's prison sentence, but said it should have been shorter.\n\nZulu spoke with The Associated Press as she pieces her life together again at the age of 26.\n\nShe said she first attempted to access legal abortion services at a public clinic, which should have given her advice or services but turned her away. She then tried a private pharmacy, which requested 800 Zambian kwacha ($43) for abortion drugs, a month's salary for her.\n\nShe was already struggling to feed her two young sons, and she sometimes had to beg food from relatives.\n\nShe said her decision to drink an herbal concoction she prepared herself, one known for terminating pregnancies, was taken out of despair. She couldn't bear for her boys to have even less food if she had another child.\n\n“I never wanted to abort my pregnancy, but it is the circumstances at home that forced me to do it,\" Zulu said in the interview at the two-room rented home with no running water that she shares with her children and parents.\n\n“I was scared (when I took the concoction), but I didn’t really care what would happen to me,\" she added.\n\nIn her court testimony, she explained what happened next: She delivered the fetus in a toilet, placed it in a sack and dropped it in a nearby stream. She said she confided in a friend, but word got out and neighbors reported her to police.\n\nZulu, who left school in the eighth grade, was never offered free legal counsel despite the right to request it. She represented herself in court and pleaded guilty to the offense of procuring her own abortion. She said she didn’t understand the legality of abortion and thought she would receive a warning.\n\n“This is a system that failed Violet,” said Rosemary Kirui, a legal adviser for Africa for the abortion rights group Center for Reproductive Rights, which campaigned for Zulu’s release and helped with her appeal. “It is not that she did not try. It is that she could not afford the services, yet she should be able to access them as a citizen of Zambia.”\n\nZulu should have been eligible for a free abortion under a provision that allows doctors in Zambia to consider risks to the well-being of her existing children, said Sharon Williams, country director for the Women and Law in Southern Africa advocacy group.\n\nBut Zulu was not aware of that, largely because of the secrecy, stigma and shame around abortion, which is not advertised by Zambia's public health system.\n\nZambia's health ministry did not respond to questions about her case.\n\nPart of the problem, Williams said, is that Zambia has legalized abortion while also defining itself in its constitution as a strongly Christian country.\n\nAbortions are still largely restricted in Africa, with few countries allowing them for reasons other than threats to the health of the mother or the fetus. Even in countries like Zambia, religious beliefs, conservative values rooted in local cultures or a lack of information make access to legal procedures difficult, according to health and rights groups.\n\nWilliams said Zulu’s case ought to lead to a national conversation over whether Zambian authorities should better educate communities over the legal right to abortion.\n\n“I think now that we have this judgment, we’re ready for the conversation,\" she said.\n\nActivists say desperate women turn to unsafe abortions. Africa and Latin America have the highest proportions of them, with approximately 75% of all abortions in Africa deemed unsafe, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute health rights organization estimated in a 2019 report that over 6 million unsafe abortions a year occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. It noted that Zambia's abortion law “tended to be a ‘paper law’ rather than one that ensures widespread access.”\n\nIn South Africa, which claims to have the most progressive laws on the continent, abortion has been legal for nearly 30 years. It is allowed on request before 13 weeks of pregnancy and for several reasons before 21 weeks.\n\nBut studies estimate only 7% of public health facilities there offer abortion services.\n\nIn 2023, the case of a 14-year-old who was denied an abortion by South African health workers three times for reasons that were not valid prompted a national reality check. After an urgent court case, a judge ordered that the girl be allowed to have an abortion, which was performed on the last day eligible by law.\n\nAt the time, a representative of the social justice group that represented the girl said South Africa's abortion laws were being undermined by \"the abuse of medical knowledge by health care professionals\" in trying to prevent abortions.\n\nIn Zambia, Zulu said she still felt bad about what she did but must now provide for her sons. She was looking for work again, she said.\n\nImray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "description": "The \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" showrunner said he included a brief scene in episode 5 to hint at Dunk's relation to Brienne in \"Game of Thrones.\"",
    "fullText": "Spoilers ahead for \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season one, episode five, \"In the Name of the Mother,\" and the book \"The World of Ice & Fire.\"\n\nHBO's newest \"Game of Thrones\" prequel, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" centers on Dunk, a lovable hero distinguished by his tall frame, raw strength, and unshakeable moral code.\n\nFor fans of the original series, that description may sound awfully familiar — and that's no accident.\n\nA blink-and-you-miss-it detail from episode five, \"In the Name of the Mother,\" draws a subtle throughline between Dunk and another prominent knight from Westerosi history: Brienne of Tarth, who appears a century later in the \"Game of Thrones\" timeline.\n\nIn a flashback scene, a young Dunk is shown walking down the kingsroad with his childhood friend, Rafe, returning to their home in King's Landing. This route runs for thousands of miles across Westeros, easing travel to and from the capital.\n\nIn \"Game of Thrones,\" Jaime Lannister sends Brienne in the opposite direction, away from King's Landing, on a quest to find and protect Sansa Stark. He also assigns Podrick Payne to serve as her squire. In season five, episode five, \"First of His Name,\" the duo travels down the same wooded path that Dunk and Rafe had trodden before.\n\n\"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" showrunner Ira Parker confirmed to Business Insider that he intentionally included this parallel. Both scenes were filmed in the same location in Ireland.\n\n\"It's the exact same road in Belfast, same trees and everything,\" Parker said. \"There's no attention drawn to it, but anyone who's a deep, deep fan of the show, hopefully, will pick up on that.\"\n\nParker said he liked the idea of distant relatives crossing paths generations apart.\n\nAuthor George R. R. Martin, who's also credited as an executive producer on \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" confirmed in 2016 at a sci-fi and fantasy convention that Brienne is Dunk's descendant.\n\nMartin's \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" trilogy doesn't cover this chapter in Dunk's life; in the last installment that was published, \"The Mystery Knight,\" he's only about 19 or 20 years old. But it sounds like, at some point during his travels, Dunk coupled up with a lady of House Tarth in the stormlands — and left a souvenir or two in his wake. In \"A Feast for Crows,\" the fourth book in Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series, Brienne recalls seeing a shield with Dunk's personal sigil in her father's armory.\n\nIn season one of \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" as in the novella it's based on, \"The Hedge Knight,\" the running joke is that no one knows who Dunk is.\n\nHe grew up as an orphan in Flea Bottom, the poorest area of King's Landing, before he became a squire for Ser Arlan of Pennytree, a sloppy hedge knight. The two would roam Westeros, taking work where they could find it and offering help when it was needed, but they rarely left an impression on the lords and ladies of the realm.\n\nAs a result, Dunk struggles to be taken seriously after Arlan's death. He has no status, no money, and no one to vouch for him. Hardly anyone even believes he's a real knight. He begins introducing himself with a slightly more impressive name: Ser Duncan the Tall.\n\nHowever, fans of Martin's source material know that Dunk's anonymity doesn't last for very long. Thanks to the fictional history book, \"The World of Ice & Fire,\" we know that his young squire, Egg, grows up to become King Aegon V Targaryen.\n\nAfter their many adventures together, King Aegon recruits Dunk to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard — the highest honor for a knight in Westeros. (This also means Dunk swore an oath not to marry or father children, which makes Brienne's lineage even more of a mystery.)\n\nDunk was so good at his job that he's still famous a century later. In season four of \"Game of Thrones,\" Dunk's name appears in the Book of Brothers, a written history of the Kingsguard.\n\n\"Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan,\" Joffrey Baratheon notes while flipping through the pages. \"He must have been quite a man.\"\n\nIndeed, Dunk's rise through the ranks closely resembles Brienne's.\n\nLike Dunk, Brienne is motivated by honor and loyalty, and she's known for her tremendous height and strength. Although she's not low-born, Brienne still struggles to earn respect as a warrior. Fighting is considered unnatural for a lady, and technically, women aren't allowed to be knighted in Westeros, so Brienne is often met with ridicule and violence.\n\nStill, she manages to overcome this unjust class system by making friends with the right people. Defying convention, Brienne is knighted by Jaime in season eight of \"Game of Thrones,\" in an episode titled \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\" She finishes the series as the very first Lady Commander of the Kingsguard.\n\nIn her final scene, Brienne writes in the very same book that features four pages about her ancestor. Odds are, by the end of her service to King Bran, she'll end up with just as many or more.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Elordi, 28, is everywhere right now — he's just not on social media.\n\nFrom \"Euphoria\" to \"Saltburn\" and \"Priscilla,\" to Guillermo del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" last year and \"Wuthering Heights,\" released last week, Elordi has cemented his place as one of Hollywood's most in-demand young actors.\n\nBut in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, he made it clear that he has no interest in putting his private life online.\n\n\"I have no relationship with social media,\" Elordi told CBS correspondent Tracy Smith.\n\n\"My dream was to be an actor. My dream was to play in the movies and, you know, I'm far too nervous to ask for more than that. I've been given exactly what I wanted, and I see it exactly how I dreamed it, and I live it how I dreamed it. So for me, that's about all I can handle,\" Elordi said.\n\nThough the Australian actor has had an Instagram account in the past, he's known to deactivate it often. His account has been deactivated since late 2024.\n\nFor Elordi, staying offline is a way to keep Hollywood from taking over his entire identity. Despite his rising profile — he's TK he says that the boundary allows him to move through his private life mostly unbothered.\n\n\"I have a pretty strong refusal to lose my life to an industry, you know. I consider myself an actor and just an actor. And so for me, life kind of goes on outside the set, and outside of these lights and cameras and things,\" he said. \"I don't have too much trouble in the world.\"\n\nEven with cameras around, Elordi says being a Hollywood star barely registers in his daily life.\n\n\"It doesn't really factor into my reality, you know,\" Elordi said. \"I have so much love in my life, and the relationships I have in my life are so present and real. I was raised in such a sort of authentic and true way.\"\n\n\"I feel so deeply here that, I don't know, the idea of this industry and stuff — it doesn't really factor into my day-to-day,\" he said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Elordi has spoken about social media and fame. In 2022, he said he woke up to 4 million new Instagram followers after his breakout role in Netflix's \"The Kissing Booth,\" and the sudden public attention made him consider quitting acting.\n\n\"I hated being a character to the public. I felt so far from myself,\" Elordi told GQ.\n\nElordi isn't the only Gen Z actor to have spoken about staying offline.\n\nIn 2025, Mia Threapleton said her mother, Kate Winslet, encouraged her to make a list of pros and cons for joining Instagram when she was 14.\n\n\"The cons completely outweighed the pros for me. That was quite a clarifying moment. Since then, the more time I spend in this world, the more I'm really happy that I don't have it,\" Threapleton said.\n\nIt's not just a Hollywood thing, either. Plenty of Gen Zers are deciding they're better off offline.\n\nThey're trading smartphones for dumb phones, turning cellphones into makeshift landlines, and throwing anti-social media parties where no one's allowed to scroll.",

    "description": "Rising prices spur more supply in metals like copper, unlike gold's constrained output, limiting the odds of a lasting commodities supercycle.",
    "fullText": "Gold's powerful rally isn't a sign that a broader commodity boom is taking hold, Goldman Sachs says.\n\nThe yellow metal has been on a record run, surging past $5,500 per troy ounce late last month before pulling back. Spot gold was trading around $4,993 per troy ounce at 10:53 p.m. ET on Sunday, up about 17% this year.\n\n\"We're not expecting a super cycle where prices will just go higher forever,\" said Lina Thomas, a senior commodities analyst at Goldman Sachs, on the firm's \"The Markets\" podcast published on Friday.\n\nThat's even as the bank maintains a positive outlook on bullion. \"We're still bullish gold,\" Thomas said, adding that the bank is \"expecting gold to go to $5,400 by the end of 2026.\"\n\nGold's surge reflects a mix of structural buying and tactical flows.\n\nCentral banks have been accumulating gold as a hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. At the same time, Federal Reserve rate cuts have lowered the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets, such as gold.\n\nThomas also pointed to the \"debasement trade\" — investor concerns about government finances in Western economies — as a key force behind demand.\n\nThat theme has spilled into the options market. Investors have increasingly bought gold call options, which give them the right to buy gold ETFs at a set price in the future. As those bets build, banks and dealers who sold the contracts often purchase gold to manage their exposure, helping accelerate rallies.\n\nHowever, the same mechanism can amplify pullbacks.\n\nIn contrast to the strength in bullion, Goldman does not see the ingredients for a prolonged, broad-based commodities supercycle.\n\n\"Gold is something that you cannot bump. It's something that you cannot scale. It's something that the production is just very constrained,\" Thomas said.\n\nOther commodities don't share those limits. Higher prices in markets like copper typically encourage more output.\n\nThat supply response makes it harder for industrial commodities to sustain ever-rising prices, even if governments and investors are increasingly focused on securing materials.\n\nSilver, meanwhile, has been far more volatile. Thomas described the metal's recent swings as \"a story of a liquidity squeeze,\" centered in London, where global benchmark prices for precious metals are set.\n\nAbout half the silver in London vaults is already spoken for, and that available supply has shrunk as traders moved metal to the US ahead of potential tariffs.\n\nWith less silver to trade, just as investor demand picked up, prices have swung sharply, and Goldman doesn't expect that volatility to ease anytime soon.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $75.40 per ounce, off sharply from its all-time high above $121 per ounce in late January.",

To get his first customers in Seoul, he decided to get Starbucks' help.\n\n\"So my strategy was, I'm going to put a Gong Cha — the first five stores — next to Starbucks,\" Berry told CNBC. \"And if I can get one in a hundred people who are going into Starbucks to come and try a Gong Cha, then I've got a business.\"\n\nGong Cha was founded in Taiwan in 1996 by Wu Zhenhua, and Berry entered the business in 2011 to expand the brand to South Korea and other countries. As of January, the chain had about 2,200 stores in 33 countries, including the US and Canada.\n\nThe chain is known for its fragrant, fruity teas and its milk foam topping.\n\nBubble tea brands have seen large success in recent years, with several making splashy IPOs.\n\nMixue, the world's largest fast-food chain that sells cheap bubble tea and ice cream, has more than 45,000 stores worldwide and just opened its first outlet in New York City at the start of the year. It went public in Hong Kong last March, with its stock jumping 30% from its IPO price at market open.\n\nOther Asian beverage brands, like Luckin Coffee, have positioned themselves as Starbucks' rivals, offering similar drinks at lower prices.

    "fullText": "The biggest software companies might be reduced to mere data sources, says Snowflake's CEO.\n\n\"The big model makers want to create a world in which all of the data for all of the enterprises is easily available to them,\" Sridhar Ramaswamy said on an episode of Alex Kantrowitz's \"Big Technology Podcast\" published last week. \"Everything else, the world, is just a dumb data pipe that feeds into that big brain.\"\n\nPrior to becoming Snowflake's CEO in 2024, Ramaswamy was a partner at Greylock Ventures and cofounded AI search startup Neeva, which was acquired by Snowflake.\n\nRamaswamy added that Snowflake needs to operate with a \"fear\" that people would stop using AI agents developed by software companies and instead want an all-inclusive agent that has data from Snowflake, for example, and everywhere else\n\nHe said his solution was to let customers take the lead and decide how they want to access their data — directly through their own agents, or through a product like ChatGPT.\n\nIn the last few months, AI labs have evolved from being sources of AI infrastructure to becoming software providers themselves. OpenAI has entered the sales, support, and document analysis market, threatening incumbents such as Salesforce and Oracle.\n\nOn a podcast released last week, Andreessen Horowitz general partner Anish Acharya said software firms were being unnecessarily punished by Wall Street over fears that AI could take over their industry. The VC said that legacy software could not be replaced so easily, because it would not be worth it to use AI for every business function.\n\nHe said that software accounts for 8% to 12% of a company's expenses, so vibe coding to build the company's resource planning or payroll tools would only save about 10%. Instead, companies should focus on big-ticket items, like developing their core businesses or optimizing other costs.\n\nRamaswamy and Acharya's comments follow a brutal start of the month for software stocks, which dragged down tech and broader markets. The sell-off started when already-wary investors panicked about Anthropic's new AI tool, which can perform a range of clerical tasks for people working in the legal industry.",

    "fullText": "Another heavy defeat for Wales. Yet another record loss at the Principality Stadium.\n\nIt is hard to judge Welsh rugby results these days after Steve Tandy's side suffered a 54-12 thrashing by France in Cardiff. It is just the same old story as they now turn their attention to the visit of Scotland next Saturday.\n\nWales suffered more misery as Les Bleus romped to an eight-try victory with the hosts wilting again for a 13th straight Six Nations defeat.\n\nFrance transformed a Test match into an exhibition of carefree rugby as the visitors claimed their biggest Six Nations triumph in the Welsh capital.\n\nHome hammerings have become the norm with Wales having conceded 50 points on more than five occasions in under a year at the Principality Stadium.\n\nArgentina, South Africa, England and France have all achieved record wins in Cardiff in the past 11 months, while Wales have now suffered 10 successive Six Nations home losses in a sequence that stretches back four years.\n\nLowest Cardiff Six Nations crowd amid rugby turmoil\n\nCan anyone stop 'massive favourites' France in Six Nations?\n\nWelsh rugby is in continued disarray and has suffered a new lowest ever Six Nations crowd for Cardiff, as supporters begin to vote with their feet.\n\nFrench fans took over the Principality Stadium and Welsh rugby bosses should be grateful they attended in such numbers.\n\nGiven all of this, you might have expected to see a dejected Welsh response after the game. Witnessing the players in another losing huddle after even more heartbreak is tough to watch.\n\nWales coach Tandy tried to remain positive, viewing it as an improvement on the opening 48-7 defeat by England - correct, although coming from a very low bar.\n\nThere should not be much cause for optimism but Wales are desperately trying to find it as they cite a better set-piece and discipline.\n\n\"We are disappointed with the scoreline but there was \n\n\"I know you're all looking at me like I'm stupid, with the path we're on, but there were glimpses with the set-piece and intent of how we wanted to go after the game.\n\n\"There was enough where we can go back on Tuesday and work on things.\n\n\"It's not the scoreline we want but it's part of the journey we're on. Every nation is at different stages.\n\n\"We've got to focus on the things we did better, like discipline, and recognise there's areas we need to grow.\"\n\nThis was the fifth time in six games under Tandy that Wales have shipped more than 40 points.\n\nThere have been 302 points and 42 tries conceded during Tandy's tenure, an average of 50 points and seven tries per game.\n\nWales have now lost 23 out of the previous 25 Test matches since the 2023 World Cup.\n\nSo Tandy was asked how he could justify any positivity to fans who had witnessed Wales suffer another heavy defeat.\n\n\"I'm a coach, I understand as well,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Most people see the outcome and people will comment on things without always seeing the data.\n\n\"I've got an understanding of where we are. We've got young players and combinations coming in, we have to go through and experience it.\"\n\nTandy insists his view is an optimistic one.\n\n\"I knew the challenge that it was, coming into Wales,\" he added.\n\n\"It excites me about where we can go. Hopefully we can look back in 18 months time or whenever it is, and this was a part of it.\n\n\"We can't click our fingers and be one of the best in the world. It's a process.\"\n\nTandy also pointed to Wales having played the top four ranked sides in the world in the past four matches, with those losses against New Zealand, South Africa, England and France.\n\n\"There's also the context of the six games we've played,\" said Tandy, whose solitary win came against Japan with the last kick of the game.\n\n\"If you look at the teams we're playing, not that it's an excuse for the numbers of points we're conceding, we're playing ruthless sides.\n\n\"So there has to be an understanding of who we're playing. We know where we want to be as a team, but also know where we are.\n\n\"We're 11th in the world and have won two in 20-plus games.\"\n\nThe former Ospreys coach insists patience is required, stressing improvements \"won't come overnight\".\n\n\"For me as a coach, it's seeing where we are growing,\" outlined Tandy.\n\n\"You might not see the bits adding together but I believe it when I'm seeing the training week, with the mindset of the boys and how they keep coming back.\n\n\"We've got some young kids and it'll take time.\"\n\nTandy accepted it was demoralising to concede more than 50 points again at home.\n\n\"That's where we're at this time,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"We've conceded lots of yellow cards and points.\n\n\"It's not an effort-based thing. There's things we need to tidy up.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to address.\"\n\nThe former Scotland and Lions defence coach insisted there is a balance to getting everything right as a team.\n\n\"It's at the forefront of what we're trying to do but with the game at the minute, there are more points being scored than before.\n\n\"With the way it's being refereed, you get on the wrong side of them and it can rack up pretty easily.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to address. We're not going to win games by conceding 50 points.\n\n\"We're keen to address and build confidence in what we're trying to do.\"\n\nWales captain Dewi Lake agreed with Tandy's assessment that his side had delivered an improved performance against France.\n\n\"It's weird to say looking at the scoreline but we were much better than we were last week for large parts of that game,\" claimed Lake.\n\n\"France are a team near the top of the world and can create things out of absolutely nothing.\n\n\"They scored some world-class tries and have some world-class individuals.\n\n\"We know there's things to mop up but we won't hide away from that fact, or that we're disappointed with the scoreboard.\n\n\"But, all in all, we were much more positive.\"\n\nLake says the character of his squad cannot be questioned.\n\n\"The boys are never going to give up on a result or a Test match or a ball on the floor, anything like that,\" said Lake.\n\n\"As captain, I don't need to say anything. Those boys are ready to go anyway.\"\n\nWelsh fans will not doubt the players' heart.\n\nThey are, though, right to question the quality of the national squad and the WRU's stewardship of the game in Wales.\n\nRecord defeats are being normalised and the world rugby public are pitying this once proud nation.\n\nThat is where Welsh rugby currently stands. It is hard to be optimistic about that.",

After all, the Ags swept Elon to begin the 2025 season that ended in massive disappointment. But if you’re looking for reasons for optimism, the Aggies scored 13 more runs than opening weekend last year, and much more importantly committed no errors after committing five on opening weekend a year ago.\n\nIt’s also safe to say that a lineup that includes both Caden Sorrell and Gavin Grahovac, in addition to a slew of newcomers, has a chance to keep this team in a ton of games.\n\nThe Aggies host A&M-Corpus Christi for a midweek tilt at 6 p.m. on Tuesday before another weekend series at Blue Bell Park next weekend against Penn.

    "description": "Keselowski is now 0-17 in the Daytona 500, and he was critical of Herbst's driving in the final seconds of the race",
    "fullText": "Entering the 2026 Daytona 500, there were concerns around if the 42-year-old Brad Keselowski could even run the full race. He showed up to the track with a walking cane, following a December fall that left him with a broken femur.\n\nBut Keselowski quickly returned to form, and was a contender throughout Sunday's 68th running of the Daytona 500 — his 17th start in 'The Great American Race.'\n\nExiting Turn 4, he had a massive run. A push from 23XI teammate Riley Herbst helped Tyler Reddick making the winning pass, but Herbst was still eying 500 glory for himself. He went to the outside of Chase Elliott in the pass for second, but Keselowski was already there with a helpful push from Logano.\n\nAs the two drivers went for the same piece of race track, a massive crash ensued across the line with Keselowski finishing fifth, suffering heavy nose-damage. Keselowski was frustrated afterwards, and openly criticized, who at the same time was being praised by 23XI co-owner Michael Jordan for helping Reddick to win the 500.\n\n\"That was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen,\" said Keselowski. \"He had no chance of blocking my run. I had a huge run, I don't know if I could have gotten the 45 [Reddick], but I would have liked to have found out because my run was coming fast. The 35 [Herbst] just wrecked us in itself.\n\nKeselowski then added: \"I thought, well, you know, a one-lane block kind of makes sense, but to block from the very bottom all the way to the top and wreck yourself and everybody else is just stupid. Very, very stupid.\"\n\nThe positive for Keselowski, beyond still scoring a top five finish, is that his leg felt fine. It didn't bother him during the race, and he exited the car under his own power. \"Felt really good in the car, felt really good getting through the crash, and I'm happy for that.\"\n\nHowever, video shows that Herbst was holding the middle lane before trying to come up into Keselowski's lane to pass Elliott, but the late block still resulted in a massive crash. In the end, it was another possible Daytona 500 victory slipping through his fingertips, and a winless streak that now sits at 60 races.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

I feel like to be a good recruiter you have to have good communication and relationship skills and he has both of them.”\n\nRivals ranks McMiller as the nation’s No. 15 running back and No. 173 prospect overall. He visited Eugene a few weeks ago.\n\n“The coaching staff of course,” he said of what stood out. “Everybody is cool. They got a good facility.”\n\nMcMiller also highlight the “winning” program.\n\n“The head coach he’s a good leader. He knows how to run a program.”\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 185-pound McMiller has 10.2 speed in the 100m dash and as a junior he used his speed to rush for 943 yards and 17 touchdowns with 186 more yards receiving and three scores.\n\n“I’m a run hard running back,” McMiller said. He can also play in the slot. “I’m not doing all that dancing. I’m straight downhill into somebody’s face.”\n\nOregon signed Rivals No. 4 ranked class in the 2026 cycle and with recruiting wins like McMiller they’ll compete for another top five haul in 2027.",

    "description": "Kansas State has reportedly parted ways with men's basketball coach Jerome Tang after it fell to 1-11 in Big 12 play on Saturday afternoon",
    "fullText": "MANHATTAN — The Jerome Tang era at Kansas State is over.\n\nThe basketball coach has been fired after four seasons of leading the Wildcats, according to a national report by On3's Pete Nakos and Joe Tipton. The university has yet to comment.\n\nKansas Stateis coming off a 78-64 loss to No. 3 Houston on Saturday, Feb. 14. The Wildcats are scheduled to host Baylor on Tuesday, Feb. 17, at 8 p.m.\n\nThe Wildcats are 10-15 overall with a 1-11 record in Big 12 play. They have six games remaining before the Big 12 Tournament in Kansas City.\n\nTang's buyout sits at $18.675 million. It was the nation's 12th-largest buyout figure entering the 2025-26 season, according to the USA TODAY Coaches Salary Database. It's believed to be the largest publicly known buyout in college basketball history.\n\nThe Tang era at Kansas State began with so much promise after he led the Wildcats to an Elite Eight appearance in his first season, 2022-23, only to take many steps back in the following three seasons.\n\nTang finished his K-State career with a 71-57 overall record. He made $3.6 million as Kansas State's coach in 2025-26. He was the 29th-highest paid coach in the country a season ago.\n\nTang has an offset clause in his contract, meaning the coach will be required to make a reasonable effort to obtain subsequent employment as long as Kansas State is obligated to pay his buyout over the next 24 months. K-State will be relieved on a dollar-for-dollar basis, provided the coach receives pay from sources directly related to being a college or professional coach, analyst, or administrator, as long as the pay is at an actual market rate.\n\nThe buyout is the largest in Kansas State athletics history. Tang replaced Bruce Weber, whom Kansas State paid a $1 million buyout after the coach resigned following the 2021-22 season. The Wildcats haven't had to fire a football coach since Ron Prince in 2008, when the two sides resolved a contract dispute that resulted in a $1.65 million buyout. The school gave Bill Snyder a $3 million payout upon his retirement after the 2018 football season.\n\nDuring his Kansas State career, Tang made north of $12.7 million, and will now more than double that with his buyout.\n\nTang had five years remaining on his contract.\n\nThe Tang era started out better than anyone could have hoped for, but the Wildcats have taken steps back each season since.\n\nKansas State was in the Elite Eight after a 26-10 record, while Tang earned Naismith National Coach of the Year honors in 2022-23. That led to Tang receiving a contract extension.\n\nThe Wildcats took a step back in 2023-24, going 19-15 and missing the NCAA Tournament. After that season, Tang was tied to openings at Arkansas and others, which led K-State to give him a raise and more guaranteed money to keep him. That's why his buyout is so massive.\n\nThat didn't lead to better results in 2024-25. A drama-filled year saw the Wildcats finish 16-17, while much was made about the Name, Image, and Likeness deals on the roster.\n\nHoping for better results, playing with a revamped but still expensive roster, the Wildcats are still struggling in 2025-26. After starting the season 5-0 and having a chance to beat Nebraska, the Wildcats have imploded since Big 12 play began. They began league play 0-5, the program's worst start since 1996-97, and never got any better.\n\nWyatt D. Wheeler covers Kansas State athletics for the USA TODAY Network and Topeka Capital-Journal.

    "description": "Laura Ziegler led Louisville Cardinals women's basketball past the Florida State Seminoles in an ACC college basketball game Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Louisville women’s basketball was forced to deviate from its normal game-opening play — a pass in the low post to Anaya Hardy for a quick layup — against Florida State on Sunday.\n\nThe Seminoles took the look away from the ninth-ranked Cardinals. The only problem was that their double team left Laura Ziegler open. The senior called for the ball and nailed the shot beyond the arc. One minute later, Taj Roberts found Ziegler in the paint for a layup. After one quarter, Ziegler had either scored or assisted on seven of the Cardinals’ eight made field goals while tallying five rebounds.\n\nThe first 10 minutes of Louisville’s ACC game against Florida State (9-17, 4-10 ACC) is what the Saint Joseph’s transfer has been doing all season. And it yielded a similar result to all but four of the Cardinals’ games as Louisville (24-4, 14-1) took down the Seminoles, 88-65, on Sunday at the KFC Yum! Center.\n\nA day after UofL was projected to be a No. 2 seed in the first NCAA Tournament Top 16 reveal, Ziegler showed why as she helped the team build a 34-20 halftime lead. She neared triple-double territory by finishing with 14 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Louisville was +28 when she was on the court, covered every inch by contributing in some way. That ranged from bringing the ball up the floor to battling in the post or getting the outlet pass for a 3-point shot.\n\nZiegler’s versatility is something head coach Jeff Walz saw from her film at Saint Joseph’s. After getting her on campus, he tried her out at the point forward position.\n\n“She passed the ball well,\" Walz said last week. “And she handles it well enough that at the 4 spot, there aren't many 4 players that are going to pick her up full-court. So, the advantage to her then is like, 'Hey, no one's really harassing me a whole bunch.' And then when teams start to put guards on her, she's bigger than they are so she can see over them. And now we're making the pass up to our guard who's being guarded by a post.”\n\nZiegler has been open to any role the team needs her to play and contributes more than just scoring. Her leadership as one of only two seniors on the roster has been invaluable. Beyond the intangibles, Ziegler leads the team in rebounds per game (7.2) and is second in points (11.5) and assists per game (2.9).\n\nHer all-around effort has helped Louisville to one of its most successful seasons over the past few years and will continue to be important with the postseason looming.\n\nLouisville is off Thursday and returns to the KFC Yum! Center to host Virginia at noon next Sunday.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Louisville women's basketball, Laura Ziegler roll past Florida State",

    "fullText": "Neither J.T. Miller nor Vincent Trocheck recorded a point in Team USA’s 5-1 win over Germany on Sunday, but the New York Rangers forwards anchored a perfect penalty kill as the Americans clinched Group C in the preliminaries at the 2016 Milan-Cortina Olympics.\n\nTH\\he United States killed off all three German power plays and improved to nine-for-nine through three contests in these Games. They are the only team that did not allow a power-play goal in the preliminary round.\n\n3-0! ✅✅✅ #WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/CQkF0QVOeB\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 15, 2026\n\nTrocheck and Miller composed the first forward grouping utilized by coach Mike Sullivan, helping the Americans shut down a German power play that featured NHL stars Leon Draisaitl, Tim Stutzle, and Moritz Seider.\n\nMiller received shoulder pats for a shot block late in the third period on USA’s third and final penalty kill. He also connected on a stretch pass with Jack Eichel at the close of the first PK, springing the Vegas Golden Knights center for a breakaway chance — although Eichel was denied by German goalie Maximilian Franzreb.\n\nThe win cemented a perfect 3-0-0 stretch in the preliminary round for the Americans. They won Group C by three points and locked up the No. 2 seed, behind only Canada, who were 3-0-0 with a plus-17 goal differential atop Group A.\n\nMiller logged 12:37 TOI, and Trocheck played a team-low 9:12 Sunday. Each was even with one shot on goal.\n\nTrocheck has two assists — both on game-winning goals — and is plus-two in three games. The 32-year-old center ranks third among all Olympic skaters with a 66.7 face-off percentage, winning 18 of 27 draws. Miller is minus-one and failed to record a point in Group C play — one of four USA skaters yet to hit the score-sheet entering the quarterfinal.\n\nQUARTERFINALS:\n\n(1) Canada vs (8) Czechia/(9) Denmark winner\n(2) USA vs (7) Sweden/(10) Latvia winner\n(3) Slovakia vs (6) Germany/(11) France winner\n(4) Finland vs (5) Switzerland/(12) Italy winner\n\nRe-seeding will take place for semifinals\n\n— Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) February 15, 2026\n\nUSA earned an automatic bid to the Olympic quarterfinals thanks to the win over Germany. The winner of the qualification play-off between No. 7 Sweden and No. 10 Latvia on Tuesday will face the Americans on Wednesday. Should Sweden prevail, Miller and Trocheck will go toe-to-toe with Rangers teammate Mika Zibanejad.\n\nA German team headed by Draisaitl posed the biggest challenge for Team USA in Group C.\n\n“We need to think of this game as a playoff-type atmosphere,” Sullivan told his squad ahead of puck drop.\n\n“That’s exactly what we did,” Minnesota Wild defenseman Brock Faber said postgame. “I thought we played a solid three periods.”\n\nFor the second game in a row, the Americans got off to a clunky start — highlighted by an awkward collision between New Jersey Devils star Jack Hughes and USA captain Auston Matthews on a Team USA power play.\n\nAuston Matthews and Jack Hughes had a massive open ice collision 😳 pic.twitter.com/P0OSRROuD9\n\n— B/R Open Ice (@BR_OpenIce) February 15, 2026\n\nEichel appeared to give the Americans a 1-0 lead in the final minute of the first period, but officials whistled the play dead before his shot, after Matthew Thachuk was checked into the crease, knocking the blocker off of Franzreb.\n\nUndeterred, USA struck before the horn sounded to close the opening frame. Matthews sent a beautiful saucer pass cross-ice, setting up Zach Werenski for a sharp wrister from the left dot at 19:51.\n\n“These games come quick,” Matthews noted at the first intermission. “We didn’t love our effort the first half of the game last night, so we wanted to come out and have a good start, and I thought we did that.”\n\nThey carried that momentum into the second period. After Miller and Trocheck helped kill an Eichel penalty 50 seconds into the frame, USA flipped the tables with a power play of their own.\n\nThis time around, Matthews got to lead the handshake line, gravitating to the front of the net and getting a stick on a shot from Quinn Hughes at 3:25.\n\nFaber gave USA a 3-0 lead at 17:35, quickly firing a high shot from the point that ricocheted off Franzreb’s glove and into the net.\n\nThe Americans made it 4-0 at 1:55 of the third period on a clapper from Tage Thompson, and Matthews tallied his second with another deflection at 6:46.\n\nStutzle netted the lone goal for Germany with a pretty snipe at 11:22.\n\nMatthews posted a game-high three points (two goals, one assist) Sunday; the Toronto Maple Leafs star leads all American skaters with three goals and five points in three games.\n\nA two-piece combo for Auston Matthews. ✌️#WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/vkQzJrWfJb\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 15, 2026\n\nUSA outscored its opponents 16-5 in Group C play. Of course, tougher challenges likely await them — namely, a dominant Canadian squad, fresh off a 10-2 rout of France on Sunday.\n\n“There’s stuff that we need to clean up,” Faber acknowledged. “But overall, I thought we got better as the tournament went on, and that’s what it’s all about. Now it gets real.”\n\nUSA gets two days of rest ahead of their quarterfinal matchup.

    "description": "NFL general managers will have to be creative in coming up with trades this offseason.",
    "fullText": "Player trades in the NFL have become more common in recent years, and one NFL insider believes the trend will continue this offseason.\n\nOn a recent episode of “The Adam Schefter Podcast,” the ESPN NFL reporter said it may be tougher for teams to get impact players this season through traditional means, meaning teams will likely be involved in more trades.\n\n“When we talk about the draft, and we’ll see how it shakes out over time, people aren’t all that excited about the draft,” Schefter said. “We got a free-agent class that’s not really deep. We’ve got a draft that is not considered really deep. You know what that tells me? More trades. That’s what it tells me. It tells me we may get more wheeling and dealing in trades than we’ve had in other years.”\n\nSchefter added that although he has not heard any specific trades that are brewing, he sees the activity around the Nov. 4 trade deadline as an indication of teams willing to make more deals to fix their rosters.\n\nThe trade market could be utilized by teams to acquire quarterbacks. This year’s quarterback draft class is not projected to be as strong as recent years, with Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza expected to go as the first overall pick and Alabama’s Ty Simpson appearing to be the only other quarterback projected as a first-round selection.\n\nKyler Murray (Arizona Cardinals) and Mac Jones (San Francisco 49ers) are expected to be the top targets on the trade market, with Raiders quarterback Geno Smith also expected to garner interest.\n\nOn the defensive side, Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby could be another player moved, although it has been previously reported that a deal for him could come after he finishes recovering from a knee injury he suffered late last season.",

In early February, the Celtics assigned him to participate in portions of a practice with their G League affiliate, the Maine Celtics, at the Auerbach Center. This included his first 5-on-5 scrimmage since the injury, involving rostered players, two-way players, and G Leaguers. Tatum described the session as the next logical step in his plan, noting he felt good afterward and emphasizing a focus on daily improvement without committing to an immediate return. He stressed following the structured progression to ensure full readiness.\n\nTeammate Jaylen Brown offered positive feedback recently, stating that Tatum “looks pretty damn good” based on what he’s observed during this phase. Reports indicate Tatum has ramped up activity aggressively, with no setbacks mentioned, and he continues individual on-court work alongside team integration efforts. Celtics president Brad Stevens has maintained a cautious approach, prioritizing Tatum being fully cleared medically and mentally at 110% before any game action.\n\nWhile a return this season remains possible, Tatum has expressed that he wants to come back at full strength, not as a diminished version of himself. Discussions continue, with no firm timeline set.\n\nCeltics’ Jaylen Brown Reveals UFC Aspirations",

    "fullText": "Because the whistles had been so plentiful, Stevie Elam’s defense in the waning moments had to be perfect.\n\nIt was ‒ depending on who you ask.\n\nAs a foul-ridden contest between rivals came to a close at UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena on Feb. 15, UW-Green Bay guard Preston Ruedinger wisely attacked the rim with his team trailing by a point and the clock under 10 seconds. Expecting at the very least to draw some contact and a whistle, all he instead encountered was Elam stripping the ball away.\n\nThe freshman stripped Ruedinger, then sank two free throws to ice a 75-72 win for the Panthers to avoid what would have been the first sweep to their in-state foes since 2018-19.\n\n\"He had to get that ball pretty clean,\" Milwaukee head coach Bart Lundy said. \"They were driving with force. We had a couple plays before that where it looked like we stopped them and we did get whistled. But Stevie Elam's strength as a true freshman, his hand strength is off the charts; it's probably NFL-level.\"\n\nLundy's counterpart disagreed, to say the least.\n\n\"The last play of the game, just to get the ball they were grabbing us and holding us,\" Phoenix head coach Doug Gottlieb said. \"Again, I understand if you're not calling that, that's fine. You had the exact same play at both ends in the last play of the game.\"\n\nGottlieb paused, ever so briefly, then aggressively slammed his fists into the table atop the dais.\n\n\"The exact same [expletive] play,\" Gottlieb yelled. \"The exact same play.\"\n\nGottlieb was fed up with the officiating crew from the afternoon after receiving a technical foul and seeing his team shoot 18 free throws compared to Milwaukee's 37. He specifically called out the technical he received in the second half with just under 7 minutes to play and his team up three, as well as a loose-ball foul on CJ O'Hara with 4:25 to go and his team up four.\n\n\"I need the new commissioner of the Horizon League to explain to me what a technical foul is when I don't leave the box, I don't curse, I'm not demonstrative,\" Gottlieb said. \"There was nothing, nothing that should have been called a technical foul. I know when I earn one. I did not earn one. The CJ play, we're up [four] points, that dramatically changed the [trajectory] of the game.\"\n\nPostgame tirades aside, the Panthers had to overcome a huge night from Green Bay’s Marcus Hall to do so, as the junior from Schofield, Wisconsin, had 32 points and seven rebounds.\n\nCentral to Milwaukee’s efforts in doing so: free throws and Chandler Jackson, who scored 23 points.\n\nTwenty-four of the Panthers' free throws came in the second half, and they hit 22 of them – despite being one of the worst free-throw shooting teams in the country at 68.5% entering the day.\n\nMilwaukee led for only 1 minute, 53 seconds in total.\n\nAfter cutting the lead to one three times prior in the final minutes, the Panthers took the lead with 69 seconds left when Esyah Pippa-White was fouled going for a defensive rebound and hit a pair of free throws.\n\nOn the other end, Hall corralled his own miss and laid it back up with 45 seconds left to put the Phoenix up 72-71.\n\nBut Amar Augillard wisely drove to the basket on the other end, where he drew a foul much to Gottlieb's chagrin and hit Milwaukee’s 19th and 20th free throws of the half.\n\n\"Our end, [if] you don't want to call a foul, he drove into traffic, whatever,\" the Phoenix second-year coach and former radio host said. \"It's the exact same play as the other end. Could not be more similar. And yet every time they drove in there it was a foul, and every time we did it was a miss.\"\n\nMilwaukee shot 19 more free throws than Green Bay despite drawing only five more fouls.\n\nJackson went 8 for 8 from the stripe as he finished two points shy of his career-high of 25 points, which he set in Milwaukee’s most recent game, Feb. 10 at IU Indy.\n\nInitially thought of as a likely redshirt candidate, Jackson has become arguably the heavily injured Panthers' most-consistent scorer of late. He’s averaging 14.1 points over his past eight games.\n\n\"To see Chandler from June to where he is now, he's just a different guy, different player,\" Lundy said. \"When we inserted Chandler, we really inserted him for his communication. He helps everyone get better defensively. That's what got him the opportunity and everything has grown from that. It wasn't like he was in practice scoring at will on everyone. He talked. He communicated. He cared.\"\n\nElam was the only other Milwaukee player to reach double-digit scoring, finishing with 11 points.\n\nWith the win, the Panthers moved a half-game clear of Youngstown State and Cleveland State for eighth place in the Horizon League, which matters because the 10th and 11th place teams face off in a play-in for the conference tournament.\n\nGreen Bay left the building, meanwhile, in a tie for third – and forcefully demanding answers from the conference.\n\n\"All we ask is that there's a fair game. That's what we ask,\" Gottlieb said. \"CJ O'Hara goes and gets an offensive rebound, their player dives at his legs and CJ gets called for a foul. I need [Jill Bodensteiner] at the league, our new commissioner, to explain to me the disparity in the officiating. That's what I need explained to me.\n\n\"I have no problem with their team, their staff. They played hard. They did what they do. They played tough and they played aggressive. I need somebody to explain to me, just those two. There are others I have massive issues with, including every time we touched them there was a foul in the second half.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Doug Gottlieb goes on postgame tirade after Milwaukee beats Green Bay",

Hannah Hidalgo led the way with 19 points to go along with eight rebounds, six steals and six assists. Cassandre Prosper and Iyana Moore each scored 14 and Malaya Cowles added 13.\n\nThe Irish never trailed in the first frame and led by as many as eight at 10-2 just 4 minutes into the contest before holding a three-point advantage with the score 17-14 following the opening 10 minutes of play. Hidalgo led Notre Dame with seven points in the quarter.\n\nNC State made a layup to start the second quarter to cut the Irish lead to one but Notre Dame roared back by scoring eight straight to push the advantage to nine at 25-16. Gisela Sanchez connected on two shots from beyond the arc to spur the run.\n\nThe Wolfpack connected on a jumper to trim the Irish advantage to seven and then Notre Dame took complete control of the rest of the half. The Irish outscored NC State 22-9 over the remaining 7:30 of play to take a commanding 47-27 lead into the halftime break.\n\nAll seven Notre Dame players that saw the court scored in the second stanza scored, led by Sanchez and Prosper who each recorded six points.\n\nThe Irish shot the ball well over the first 20 minutes of play, going 16-for-31 from the field and 7-of-12 from three-point range.\n\nNotre Dame didn’t allow NC State to make a run to get back in the game coming out of the half, as it outscored the visitors 18-15 in the third quarter to take a 65-42 lead into the final 10 minutes of action.\n\nNC State managed to score 25 points in the final frame but it was not enough, as the Irish cruised to the 79-67 victory.\n\nNotre Dame’s defense was everywhere and gave the Wolfpack fits, causing 22 in the win, which marks the most turnovers by NC State this season. The Irish capitalized by outscoring NC State 24-2 in points off turnovers.\n\nNotre Dame improves to 11-6 against NC State in the all-time series.\n\nThe 30-point second quarter marks ND’s sixth 30-point quarter of the season and first in ACC play.\n\nThe Irish handed NC State its worst loss of the season on Sunday in the 12-point victory.\n\nNotre Dame finished with 17 steals, marking the 19th time the team has recorded double-digit steals in a game this season.\n\nThe Irish never trailed for the duration of the 40 minutes.\n\nHidalgo has finished in double figures in the scoring column in all 92 games of her career, the longest streak in program history.\n\nSunday marked the 12th game this season that Hidalgo finished with five or more steals.\n\nProsper finished with five steals, her second highest output of the season.\n\nThe Fighting Irish hit the road for a midweek matchup against Wake Forest at 6 p.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 19 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

    "description": "Seahawks with a stunning hire to run their offense",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks became victims of their own success this season when the Las Vegas Raiders hired away offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak to be their next head coach. With Kubiak gone, this presented an obvious hole that needed filling in their coaching staff. Seattle was widely expected to promote from within, and understandably so. However, the Seahawks often \"zag\" when folks expect them to \"zig\" and they did so once more.\n\nOn Sunday, it was reported by ESPN's Adam Schefter that Seattle is expected to hire San Francisco 49ers tight end coach Brian Fleury to be their next offensive coordinator. This was a name that was not on anyone's radar... anyone except Mike Macdonald, of course.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Nick Wagoner and Brady Henderson, Fleury was heavily involved in San Francisco's ground attack, as his official position last season was tight ends/run game coordinator. Henderson also notes with Fleury coming from the same Shanahan coaching line as Kubiak, the continuity will be kept largely in tact for quarterback Sam Darnold. This was exactly the logic for hiring within, so going with Fleury does make sense in this regard.\n\nFleury also brings intimate knowledge of Seattle's most hated rival. He's been with the Niners since 2019 in various coaching roles, and of course also knows how best to attack both the Rams and Arizona Cardinals. Although, this will be Fleury's first time as an offensive coordinator, and with Mike Macdonald focusing primarily on defense, he will have a lot on his plate as the one in full control of the offense.\n\nThe Seahawks will begin their title defense with a rookie offensive coordinator, but if Mike Macdonald's earned anything it's our trust he's made the right call.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks moves: 49ers TE coach Brian Fleury new offensive coordinator",

    "fullText": "Logan Webb makes his intentions for the upcoming season clear originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's been four seasons since the San Francisco Giants made the postseason, and during that 2021 playoff run, they suffered a crushing defeat to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games of the NLDS.\n\nThat was the team's standout pitcher. Logan Webb's third season, which has been the only postseason appearance of his career, is entering his eighth season, and the ace is ready for that to change.\n\n\"I'm tired of finishing around .500. I know fans are tired of it. None of us is happy about it, either. I've been here the longest now, and it's frustrating,\" Webb exclaimed.\n\nMore: Giants sign former Guardians outfielder in late free agent move\n\nThe frustration Webb speaks of is justified, since being a mediocre team can be worse than being at the bottom of the barrel, especially if the team remains the same.\n\nHowever, whenever one of the best players on the team is stating how much he is tired of losing and individual is not enough more and winning is the top priority, it can end up lighting a positive fire under the team to go out there and turn things around, which is what the franchise needs as that 2021 postseason is the only appearance for San Francisco in the last nine seasons, but before that the team had won three World Series titles over five seasons from 2010-2014.\n\nIf the Giants don't begin to turn their fortunes around, that could start to upset Webb to the point where he may eventually want to be traded to a better situation. A dominant starting pitcher like Webb does not come around as often as one might think.\n\nBased on the resume that Webb has built for himself, he will be play a huge role in the team having success if that happens this season, especially if the all-star can have anywhere close to the season that he had last year, where he recorded a 15-11 record, 3.22 ERA, and 224 strikeouts, which was good for third most in the league behind only Tarik Skubal and Garrett Crochet.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nAn Edwin Diaz nightmare looms for the Mets\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nWe now know what the ABS challenge system strike zone will look like\n\nSpencer Strider's finish to 2025 changes everything for Braves",

    "fullText": "BOCA RATON — Florida Atlantic’s men’s basketball team continued its shocking free fall on Feb. 15. The Owls lost 83-81 in overtime to first-place South Florida in an American Conference state showdown.\n\nKanaan Carlyle, playing for the time since Feb. 1, missed a game-winning three-point attempt in the final seconds to seal the Owls’ (14-12, 6-7) fate.\n\nAfter starting out conference play 6-1 and sitting in first place, FAU’s losing streak has now reached six games, and the Owls have fallen to 10th in the razor-thin standings.\n\nMore college basketball: Florida basketball makes another statement in SEC race by dispatching Kentucky\n\nCarlyle scored 15 points on 5-for-13 shooting in his return. Devin Vanterpool led FAU with 26 points, and USF (18-8, 10-3) was led by Wes Enis with a game-high 27 points.\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to Rice on Feb. 11, the Owls were able to go toe-to-toe with the best team in the American, but couldn’t secure the victory.\n\n“I think we’re going to get hot,” FAU coach John Jakus said. “We’ll keep it going.”\n\nFAU will be back in action on Feb. 18 for a road matchup in San Antonio with the UTSA Roadrunners.\n\nHere are the takeaways from the latest loss:\n\nPerhaps the most notable change for the Owls was the return of starting point guard Kanaan Carlyle, who has been out for three of FAU’s last four games due to a calf injury.\n\nCarlyle looked healthy while knocking down 3 of his 8 three-pointers in 36 minutes of action. The junior had a chance to win it in the closing seconds of overtime, but came up just short from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Owls’ offense hummed much more soundly than it has in recent weeks. Five Owls — Carlyle, Vanterpool, Josiah Parker, Devin Williams and Isaiah Elohim — scored in double figures, but it wasn’t enough to take down the top team in the American.\n\nNonetheless, Jakus is confident that Carlyle’s return will make life easier heading into the final stretch of the regular season.\n\n“You can tell with Kanaan back, there’s a couple things that are pretty distinctive,” Jakus said. “There was just a flow of the way we play when they play together.”\n\nAmid a deflating losing streak, Jakus opted to make an adjustment to the team’s starting lineup by inserting Parker in place of the struggling Xander Pintelon.\n\nParker entered the matchup averaging 12.5 points and 7.5 rebounds per game against American Conference opponents and had been particularly exceptional of late, averaging 17.3 points and 9.0 rebounds per game in February.\n\nParker posted a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double to go along with two blocks. The performance was histhird-consecutive double-double, fifth of the season.\n\nHis upward trajectory has been arguably the only positive to come about during FAU’s losing skid, with Jakus acknowledging the time had come for Parker to start.\n\n“He’s the best freshman in the league,” Jakus said. “He’s averaging 17 and 10 over the last five games and we haven't won, so at a certain point I’m going to make a change in the starting lineup.\n\n“I liked bringing him off the bench. I thought there was a punch to that when we were 5-1. It was fun and cute to have him coming off the bench, but it’s not cute right now. We need guys to perform.”\n\nUSF’s Wes Enis and Joseph Pinion did their best “Splash Brothers” impression, knocking down a combined nine three-pointers. In the first half, it was Enis who got hot from downtown, scoring 18 of his 27 points while hitting four of his eight three-point tries.\n\nSouth Florida shot 36 percent from the floor, and 26 percent from three as a team, before halftime, but Enis’ shooting kept the game tight.\n\nIn the second half, it was Pinion’s turn to light up the Owls from beyond the arc. After scoring 4 points on 2-for-7 shooting from the floor and 0-for-3 from downtown in the first half, Pinion scored 12 points, hitting all four of his shots from three-point range in the latter half.\n\nIn a game in which USF made 13 of 39 layups, it was the marksmanship of Enis and Pinion that led to the Owls' demise. Both players hit numerous shots that were several feet beyond the three-point line, stretching FAU’s defense to the max as the Owls struggled to contain the long-range shooters.\n\n“Some of it is the actions, some of it is falling asleep for half a second, and then some of it is the fact that they can invert the floor all the way to the volleyball line,” Jakus said. “I think the very worst mistake you make is when you’re too low, and you let them see one go in. If you’re low, it’s over.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Beach Post: USF Bulls edge FAU Owls in overtime in American Conference basketball",

    "fullText": "Two weeks ago, the No. 7 Michigan women’s basketball eked out a three-point overtime win in East Lansing against No. 13 Michigan State.\n\nSunday afternoon told another story. With a dominant second quarter in which the Wolverines outscored the Spartans, 26-9, Michigan (22-4 overall, 13-2 Big Ten) seized momentum and never looked back to defeat Michigan State (20-6, 9-6), 86-65.\n\n“They jumped on us right away,” head coach Kim Barnes Arico said. “We weren’t able to get stops, and then we kind of settled in and really got stops for the rest of the game. Our second-quarter defense was outstanding, but I thought our defense and the way we forced turnovers all game was really exceptional. Olivia (Olson) and Syla (Swords) were both tremendous, but they had a lot of support from their teammates as well.”\n\nTrailing 21-15 following the first quarter, the Wolverines had to make an adjustment. The Spartans were driving consistently and scoring in the paint — all but three of their points resulted from paint points or free throws — while Michigan struggled to get clean looks offensively. With intense ball pressure, Michigan State sped up the Wolverines, impairing their shot selection. Despite collecting offensive rebounds, rather than resetting the offense, Michigan failed to convert on a few second chances.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Wolverines turned that trend on its head.\n\n“Second quarter, it was wild,” Michigan State head coach Robyn Fralick said. “… It was a lot of self-inflicted, just playing a little bit sped up, which we hadn’t early. And then that got us just out of rhythm, out of sorts. I mean, you can’t turn the ball over that much and be effective. And then in the second quarter, we gave up so many second shots, too, so that makes the game really hard.”\n\nInstead of speeding Michigan up, the Spartans were chasing an unsustainable pace themselves. They coughed up the ball 12 times, some unforced errors like travels or inaccurate passes, and others a direct product of the Wolverines’ sticky fingers.\n\nLed by senior guard Brooke Quarles Daniels, Michigan ramped up the pressure, pouncing on Michigan State’s mistakes and converting them into transition points.\n\n“This needs to go somewhere, but (Brooke) needs to be on that Defensive Player of the Year list,” Swords said. “She is the best defender in the country. She fuels our defense. She allows Liv to pick up full court, allows us to have a rest, because she’s picking up the best player anywhere she goes. So she really fuels the way we play, the style of play, the fast pace, the fun pace that comes from Brooke, so her name needs to be heard. She needs to be on any and every list out there.”\n\nWith the Swords-proclaimed DPOY leading the charge, the Wolverines converted 12 turnovers into 14 points, coupled with 11 second-chance points on six offensive rebounds to shoot past the Spartans with a 26-9 second quarter in which Michigan State attempted just seven total shots. The frame was most prominently marked by a stretch from 6:50 to the three-second mark of the first half in which Michigan outscored the Spartans, 19-2.\n\nMichigan State averaged 12.7 turnovers per game, with 20 as its previous season high. With 16 at halftime and finishing with 24, turnovers were the tale of the tape that separated the Wolverines for good.\n\nBut that separation factor was compounded by offensive efficiency. Michigan took better shots, and those clean looks were a byproduct of transition offense and success on the glass. Strong ball movement set up Swords, who sank two key triples to punctuate the game-defining run. Swords’ 10 second-quarter points surpassed the Spartans’ total on her own, and combined with an efficient 47 percent from the floor for 24 points overall.\n\nThe Swords-Olson tandem electrified a season-best crowd of 11,627 for a combined 47 points, including perfect 12-for-12 combined from the free throw line. Olson’s trademark midrange jumper and Swords’ splashy outside shots overpowered the Spartans’ defense, taking what was given and exploiting opportunities. Olson finished with her seventh consecutive 20-point game.\n\nWith former Michigan great Naz Hillmon in attendance for her jersey retirement, with “00” hanging from the rafters — a major reason why Olson and Swords chose Michigan — the Wolverines of today put on a show. Securing the season sweep in both the highest-ranked matchup and largest margin of victory in rivalry history for Michigan, surpassing a mark set by Hillmon’s team itself in 2020, the Wolverines wrote a new chapter in the rivalry.",

    "fullText": "One of the biggest stories for the host nation Italy at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games has been the amazing comeback story for alpine skier Federica Brignone. Many thought she would not be healthy enough to compete on the Italian slopes this month.\n\nBrignone is not just a competitor at the Winter Olympic Games at the moment, but a dominant one. She has come away with two individual gold medals with victories in the women’s giant slalom and women’s super giant slalom.\n\nBefore Sunday no skier had ever won the women’s super giant slalom and women’s giant slalom at the same Olympic Winter Games.\n\nIt has been accomplished twice on the men’s side. Markus Wasmeier of Germany won the giant slalom and super giant slalom at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer, and Herman Maier won these same two alpine skiing events at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano.\n\nThe reason why this accomplishment is noteworthy is because of the differences between a giant slalom race and super giant slalom race. The giant slalom race is a lot more technical, while the super giant slalom is associated with downhill more, and is a speed race.\n\nBrignone tore her anterior cruciate ligament during a giant slalom race at the Italian National Alpine Skiing Championships in Val di Fissa, Italy on April 3.\n\nInitially, Brignone was diagnosed with a broken tibia and broken fibula. During the operation, it was determined that Brignone had also ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament according to Lena Smirnova of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nBrignone’s crash in Italy came 10 months prior to Lindsey Vonn’s spectacular crash in Italy in the women’s downhill to begin the 2026 Olympic Winter Games.\n\nBrignone’s super giant slalom win on Thursday came with a time of 1:23.41. She beat her nearest opponent, silver medalist Romane Miradoli of France by 0.41 seconds.\n\nThen on Saturday in the giant slalom, Brignone beat silver medalists Sara Hector of Sweden and Thea Louise Stjernesund of Norway, by 0.62 seconds. Brignone’s winning time was 2:13.50.\n\nThe host nation now has eight gold medals. There is another Italian woman with two individual gold medals. That is Francesca Lollobrigida, who won gold in the women’s 3000 metres and women’s 5000 metres.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Federica Brignone comes back from torn ACL to win two Olympic gold medals appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "FC Bayern has talent in between the sticks.",
    "fullText": "As Bayern Munich continues to balance legacy with long-term planning, CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen offered thoughtful insight into one of the club’s most emotionally charged questions— the future of club legend Manuel Neuer and the rise of his potential successor, Jonas Urbig.\n\nNeuer, of course, suffered a calf injury in the team’s 3-0 victory over Werder Bremen on Saturday and will be replaced by Urbig in the starting XI until the veteran can return. Speaking about Neuer’s situation, Dreesen emphasized patience and respect for a player whose performances continue to defy time.\n\n“Manuel will be 40 on March 27. You wouldn’t believe that if you’ve followed him in recent games and seen how many incredible saves he made. We spoke early on, and he wants to give himself time and we also want to give him and ourselves time. We’ll discuss things calmly during the season and see what happens next,” Dreesen said on a recent appearance on BR24Sport.\n\nThe quote reflects Bayern’s typically measured approach to transitions involving iconic figures. Rather than forcing a timeline, the club appears committed to allowing Neuer’s performances—and his own feelings—to guide the decision. Given his enduring quality, that restraint feels both respectful and practical. Few goalkeepers in world football history have maintained elite standards so deep into their careers, and Neuer’s continued influence in big moments makes any immediate succession plan far from straightforward.\n\nAt the same time, Bayern is clearly preparing for the future. Dreesen spoke warmly about Urbig’s development and, perhaps more importantly, the relationship forming between the young goalkeeper and the veteran he may one day replace.\n\n“Jonas is doing a great job. The chemistry between him and Manu is excellent, which is particularly important. I think Manu has made it his mission to build Jonas up as his successor and pass on his experience to him. You can see that in training when they talk to each other. That makes us happy. Jonas has already shown his great potential in the games he played. He just needs to gain experience through match practice. He’s played a lot more games than those before him. I hope he continues this way,” Dreesen said.\n\nThis mentorship element is striking. Bayern’s greatest generational handovers—from past leaders to new cornerstones—have often worked best when knowledge was shared rather than guarded. If Neuer is actively shaping Urbig’s growth, the eventual transition could feel less like an ending and more like a continuation of standards.\n\nFor supporters, the message is reassuring on multiple levels. Neuer is still trusted, valued, and performing at a remarkable level. Meanwhile, the club is not standing still; it is cultivating the next era with intention and care.\n\nIn true Bayern fashion, sentiment and strategy are moving together. Whether Neuer extends his story for another season or gradually passes the gloves forward, the process appears calm, respectful, and deliberate—exactly the way a club of Bayern’s stature prefers to shape its future.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Vinicius Junior has had a difficult 18 months on the pitch, but there are signs that he’s returning to his best level at Real Madrid. He’s been in good form over the last few weeks, and it comes at an important time too, considering his uncertain future at the Bernabeu.\n\nVinicius is out of contract in June 2027, and so far, there has been no breakthrough regarding a new deal. Despite this, he’s made it clear that he’s very happy at Real Madrid, as he told Ibai Llanos (via Diario AS).\n\n“I’m very happy. Playing for Real Madrid, having the life I have and my family makes me happy. Being happy on and off the pitch is the best.”\n\nVinicius’ form has suffered since Kylian Mbappe joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2024, but according to the man himself, the pair have a great relationship both on and off the pitch. He also revealed that he was pushing the Frenchman to join in the years before he quit Paris for Madrid.\n\n“Every summer I wrote to him: ‘When are you coming?’ I acted as an agent. With Bellingham I did too. I want to play with the best to have more options to win. We spend more time with each other than with our family. We have to have a good relationship.”\n\nVinicius also responded to a question on how he manages to keep his feet on the ground after becoming a big name in football at such a young age.\n\n“When we are very young we don’t learn to be famous. I came out of nowhere to be famous and not be able to go out on the street. The good side is that people love you a lot, but the bad thing is the press and the rival fans. But I love (rival fan whistles). We train for these games. In the moments of pressure is when the best players stand out, and at Real Madrid, we are ready.”\n\nVinicius, who spoke with Ronald Araujo during the Barcelona defender’s recent break from football, revealed how he takes care of his own mental health.\n\n“You have to listen to everything, not just the good things.”",

One of the submissions was from our very own sdphinsfan. sdphinsfan pointed out the fact that the NFL has consistently adjusted the rules over the years to favor offensive production. The assumption being that exciting offenses are what the fans most want to see. But despite the league pushing for offensive production while finding ways to restrict defenses, it still seems as if defense wins championships more often than not. It’s not to say that you don’t need offensive production in the NFL, but all things equal, the postseason games tend to go to the teams that dominate on defense. This is also somewhat in contrast to the regular season, where a team with a dominant offense can win a high percentage of its games, even while fielding a subpar defense.\n\nSo the now obvious Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nIn the NFL, where the rules and the game in general are now geared toward a higher rate of offensive production and, in turn, higher scoring, why are NFL Championships still won on the backs of dominant defenses?\n\nPlease share your thougths and answers in the comment section below-",

    "title": "Implications of the Zac Gallen Signing",
    "description": "Our panelists discuss the implications of the Zac Gallen signing, how it will impact the rotation, and more!",
    "fullText": "DBacksEurope: It is probably true that Gallen improves the 2026 rotation. 2025 first half Gallen was probably a worser version of the pitcher that he actually is, but we’ve seen Zac becoming increasingly worse and frustrated over the past few seasons, to an extent where we had to conclude that he wasn’t the ace we thought he once was (going to be). The longer Gallen was unsigned, the more likely it would be that he would end up in Arizona again. The QO was a no-brainer for me, so I think it is a good signing. Boras probably tried to pull a Montgomery here again, but thankfully the Diamondbacks didn’t fall for that one. I think there is still a lack of overall quality on this roster that will prevent us from becoming a serious wild card contender.\n\nJames: It’s fine. I don’t love it. I don’t hate it. Frankly, there are no better starting pitchers on the market at this point. Nor were there any better pitchers earlier in free agency that were coming for less money. With the team being up against the financial wall they are, I am actually a little bit surprised they took a gamble on bringing Gallen back. But then, they were desperate for another starter and this also helps the gutted bullpen. In that regard, this is a wise signing. Mike Hazen and his staff are mad if they think Soroka is going to be able to provide 120 IP out of the rotation. He might not even reach 80 IP.\n\n1AZfan1: Knee jerk reaction is this is good for the 2026 Diamondbacks. Given the state of the roster (especially the projected IL) and looking around the rest of the NL, the best chance to make the postseason would come through some exceptional individual performances by players well above their projection. Gallen isn’t likely to be a 3.50 ERA guy next year, but he’s got a better shot at it then anyone else available on the market.\n\nBen: This pairing always made sense. He’s functionally spent his entire career with the D-Backs and he’s clearly pretty comfortable with the franchise and the environment. That said, this is a floor-raising rather than a ceiling-raising move. Clearly, the rotation and roster are better with Gallen than without him, but it’s up to him and the coaching staff to try and fix the fact that his fastball went from one of the best to well-below average over the course of just a couple of years.\n\nWesley: I find it hilarious that he could and probably should have taken the qualifying offer and we’d be in the exact same position as we are right now.. Outside of that, it’s fine. Hopefully, Gallen didn’t spend the whole winter just appearing on podcasts, and actually spent some time sorting out whatever mechanical/mental issue that lead to his disaster of a 2025 season.\n\nDano: Kneejerk reaction was a booming “Meh,” with full echoes and reverb. Also, like Wesley, I appreciate the inherent hilarity of it. Beyond that, I expect him to pitch over the season much like he pitched in 2025–some good, some bad, truly mediocre performance for a wannabe “staff ace,” but serviceable enough for a third or fourth starter. Hence the “Meh.” In any event, he’ll likely be better than Soroka would have been taking the mound every fifth day, so that should be nice.\n\nSpencer: It’s perfectly fine. There’s upside and floor. The price is adequate in that 2020s Kendrick way. I’ve never understood why fans seem so focused on how he has a negative ego. Personally I’ve never seen that but I also watch from the east coast so I will be first in line to admit I often fall asleep by the third inning (10pm start time when wake up is at 4:15 is just not feasible). I’d rather have a starter with a chip on their shoulder than not if we’re talking mid range with ceiling.\n\nDBacksEurope: I don’t think there is a scenario where E-Rod, with $40MM left on his contract, isn’t starting for the Diamondbacks in 2026 as long as his ERA stays below 6.00. So, this is probably worse news for Soroka, who will only be here one year. Although he will probably start in long relief, he will see plenty of action with Pfaadt and E-Rod shitting the bed more often than not, providing a podium for him to perform, just like Nelson did last year. Then injuries will occur and he’ll get his starts.\n\nJames: I guess it depends on how one defines bad news. Soroka is the one being bumped from the rotation. Expecting him to have been an effective, 30-game starter was always a bit bonkers to begin with. If the team keeps the entire rotation healthy and does not spend a few weeks running a 6-man rotation until someone gets injured, then Soroka goes to the bullpen, where he can provide some heat in middle, low-leverage relief. When the inevitable E-Rod injury occurs, Soroka might get some starts. Or, if he is effective in relief (where he is better suited), they can leave him in the bullpen and bring up Drake.\n\n1AZfan1: Knee jerk reaction here is Soroka is the odd man out of the Opening Day rotation, but that is only provided that there are no injuries during Spring Training. It’s likely, or at least a coin flip’s chance, that one of the 6 possible starters will suffer some injury in Spring and the decision will be made for Torey on who will start the year in the rotation.\n\nBen: I tend to agree with the rest of the Roundtable: Soroka likely is the first one out of the rotation and bumped to a swingman/long-relief role where he’s had some success over the course of his career. Of course, it’s near-impossible that these six will be the same starters at the Trade Deadline let alone the end of the season and Soroka will almost certainly get a few chances to start if he stays healthy.\n\nWesley: Just to further echo what the others have already said, I’d say Soroka is the odd man out. I am much more comfortable with him as a BP arm or spot starter than I am as part of the starting rotation.\n\nDano: Soroka definitely, at least if Soroka really wants to reestablish himself as a starter. That said, it seems like he found a good deal of success pitching out of the bullpen, so it might wind up being better for him if he can firmly establish himself as a good long reliever/swingman.\n\nSpencer: Unfortunately I think Soroka will be pushed out of the rotation. Assuming ERod somehow stays healthy. But if the goal is to win games it should be the opposite. He’s 5 years younger and his overall production is closer to ERods than you might think if you only go off vibes rather than results. That’s not to say ERod hasn’t had the better career thus far, but if I’m going for ceiling and floor, I’m riding the potential of Soroka knowing he’s only good for 20 starts at most. That way ERod can try to remain healthier than average by only throwing a few pitches at a time. But I suspect the goal isn’t necessarily to win this season and therefore ERod will get the rotation spot and Soroka will be risked in the bullpen.",

    "description": "Collin Morikawa ended a 28-month winless streak, securing his seventh career Tour title at the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am with a dramatic birdie.",
    "fullText": "PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — Collin Morikawa birdied the 72nd hole to win the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am by one stroke over Min Woo Lee and Sepp Straka.\n\nHe ended a 28-month winless spell with his seventh career Tour title, shooting a 5-under 67 at Pebble Beach Golf Links and finished with a 72-hole aggregate of 22-under 266.\n\nMorikawa surged into contention on Saturday, hitting all 18 greens in regulation, pouring in 11 birdies and shooting 10-under 62. How good was Morikawa’s ball-striking? It was just the third time he hit all 18 greens in his career and he gained 6.472 strokes on the field in approach shots, the best Strokes Gained: Approach number of his career, the best in AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am history and the second best in the Shotlink era (dating to 2004).\n\nAfter a subpar Ryder Cup for Team USA, Morikawa started the season with a missed cut in Hawaii and a lackluster T-54 last week in Phoenix. That made nine straight starts dating to late June without a top-10 finish. But his swing coach, Rick Sessinghaus, gave him the pep talk he needed on Friday night and Morikawa put on a stripe show on the weekend.\n\n“He’s way more of a feel player than people realize. Everybody thinks he’s kind of a robot, and he is a robot so-to-speak,” Morikawa’s caddie Mark Urbanek said. “He just kind of got back to hitting shots and being a shot maker, and that’s what he does best.”\n\nOn a day when nine different golfers were within two strokes of the lead as the leaders headed to the back nine, Morikawa made four birdies and one bogey coming home, including birdies at three of the last four holes. But he made a bogey at 17 to drop back into a tie with Lee, who shot 65, at 20 under. Morikawa drove it in the fairway and had 235 yards to the green. Then he had to wait 20 minutes for Jacob Bridgeman to get a ruling, take a drop and wait for his ball to remain still in the wind long enough for him to putt out. Morikawa paced, stared at the beautiful backdrop that is Carmel Bay and sifted through potential baby names. “Not Bogey,” he later cracked.\n\nWaiting behind the 18th green to congratulate his friend was Russell Henley, who had chipped in at the Arnold Palmer Invitational 11 months ago to edge Morikawa by a stroke. Henley was confident that Morikawa would get the job done. “He’s got a 4-iron. That’s his club,” Henley said.\n\nAdded Straka, who eagled the last to tie for second and played alongside Morikawa in the final threesome: “He's one of the best iron players of our generation probably. He likes to cut it so it makes it even harder with that wind blowing 25, 30 off your left. Yeah, that is a pretty special shot to put it away there.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Collin Morikawa wins AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, ends winless streak",

    "fullText": "North Carolina opened its 2026 baseball season with a three-game sweep of Indiana that quickly turned into a showcase for both its revamped lineup and deep pitching staff.\n\nThe Tar Heels opened the season 3-0, while the Hoosiers fell to 0-3. With numerous first-time starters and key transfers, North Carolina used timely extra-base hits and strong pitching to control the series.\n\nHere’s what happened in all three games\n\nNorth Carolina opened its 2026 baseball season with a 9-4 win over Indiana at Boshamer Stadium.\n\nThe Tar Heels used three runs in the fifth and six in the sixth to break open a game that began as a pitchers’ duel, with both starters allowing only three hits combined. The win gives Carolina a 1-0 edge in the all-time series.\n\nRight-hander Jason DeCaro took care of business on the mound as he gave up two hits, no runs and struck out seven over five innings while the lineup, featuring eight first-time starters in Carolina blue, found its rhythm.\n\nTransfer Jake Schaffner drove in the season’s first run with a sacrifice fly before preseason All-America shortstop Gavin Gallaher ripped a two-run triple, the second triple of his career.\n\nWho else but @GallaherGavin to break this thing wide open?!?! \n\nTriple puts us up 3-0 😤 pic.twitter.com/s7Ga9j2uxD\n\n— Carolina Baseball (@DiamondHeels) February 13, 2026\n\nIndiana cut the deficit to two in the sixth, but UNC answered with six runs in the bottom half to put the game out of reach.\n\nFreshman Tyler Howe recorded his first career hit with an RBI double, followed by a two-run double from Colin Hynek and a triple by Schaffner to left-center.\n\nReliever Boston Flannery allowed one hit over 2 1/3 innings in his longest career outing for the Tar Heels.\n\nNorth Carolina won both games in its doubleheader sweep of Indiana, rolling to a 12-2, seven-inning run-rule win in Game 1 and walking off 4-3 in 11 innings in Game 2 at Boshamer Stadium on Saturday.\n\nThe Tar Heels extended their streak to 12 straight opening-weekend series wins, nine of them sweeps. It was the first time in program history that they recorded a run-rule and an extra-innings game in the same series.\n\nIn Game 1, an all-around dominant effort produced UNC’s first run-rule of the season.\n\nErik Paulsen had a fantastic day at the plate as he drove in the first run of the doubleheader in the first inning, then broke the game open with a three-run homer in the fifth — the Tar Heels’ first home run of 2026. He finished with five RBIs.\n\nFirst one of the year was a no doubter 🚀@Erik_Paulsen44 says hello and goodbye! pic.twitter.com/2UVdn9BxJw\n\n— Carolina Baseball (@DiamondHeels) February 14, 2026\n\nLeft-hander Folger Boaz allowed two hits and one run with six strikeouts over five innings.\n\nA six-run sixth, highlighted by a two-run triple from Colin Hynek and another triple from Jake Schaffner, put the game away. The Tar Heels totaled four triples over the first two games of the series, their most in back-to-back games since at least March 2015.\n\nGame 2 turned into a pitching and defense showcase. Ryan Lynch, officially joining the weekend rotation, settled after a first-inning run to work five innings with three hits, one run and six strikeouts.\n\nReliever Matthew Matthijs, back from Tommy John surgery suffered April 4, 2025, threw 2.1 innings, looked like his old self as he allowed one hit and struck out three.\n\nAn error behind him helped Indiana score twice, but North Carolina tied it in the ninth when second baseman Aiden Stewart misplayed a grounder, allowing two runs to score and sending the game to extra innings.\n\nBonus baseball at the Bosh 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/PywH6xay1u pic.twitter.com/uhmL5RrcQ3\n\n— Carolina Baseball (@DiamondHeels) February 14, 2026\n\nIn the 11th, catcher Macon Winslow launched a 398-foot line-drive homer off the scoreboard for UNC’s first opening-weekend walk-off since 2020.\n\nNorth Carolina hosts Richmond on Tuesday at 4 p.m. ET on ACCNX.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Baseball: Diamond Heels sweep Indiana to open 2026 campaign",

    "fullText": "News broke on Feb. 4 that Jeff Stoutland, the Philadelphia Eagles’ run game and offensive line coach, will not return to the team next season. The report from ESPN’s Tim McManus came as a complete shock to fans.\n\nStoutland has coached Philadelphia’s offensive line since 2013. During his tenure, he’s played a key role in developing one of the league’s best units. Jason Kelce, Jordan Mailata, and Mekhi Becton are just some of the players who greatly benefited from Soutland’s guidance.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Mailata, a current star for the Eagles’ offensive line, said he is “heartbroken” by the news. Additionally, veterans Lane Johnson and Landon Dickerson are reportedly contemplating retirement, which is likely tied to Stoutland’s departure.\n\nThis unexpected exit is shaking up Philadelphia’s offseason plans and has left fans with many questions.\n\nThe timing of Stoutland’s exit in relation to the hiring of new offensive coordinator Sean Mannion may not be a coincidence.\n\nNBC Sports’ Dave Zangaro noted how Mannion’s staff-building decisions this offseason could indicate a significant shift Philadelphia’s offensive identity for 2026.  Rumors are circulating that Mannion wants the reins of the offense entirely to himself. As he brings in several new coaches and staff members who share his vision, perhaps Stoutland saw the writing on the wall that changes are coming, and he wasn’t going to be a part of them.\n\nStoutland’s frustrations with Philadelphia’s operation date back to last season. He was reportedly irritated with the Eagles’ offense and his lack of contribution to the group towards the end of the year. In these reports, it’s said that head coach Nick Sirianni and former offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo had complete control over the offense in the final few games.\n\nCayden Steele at NJ.com wrote about how the divide late last season played a role in the separation. According to Steele, Stoutland was “not consulted” enough regarding changes in the run game.\n\nThat isn’t to say Stoutland was blameless. This season’s offensive line is one of the weakest he’s coached in his 13 years with the Eagles. However, a lot of that can be chalked up to injury. Johnson missed significant time, and Dickerson played through lingering injuries all year. Still, that doesn’t explain the regression from Mailata and Cam Jurgens.\n\nBut even in a down season, the Eagles’ offensive line still graded as the seventh-best in the NFL, per Pro Football Focus.\n\nMannion has instead brought in a slew of new offensive coaches. He is expected to incorporate a “west coast” type of offense, similar to that of Sean McVay or Kyle Shanahan.\n\nChris Kuper will be the new offensive line coach to replace Stoutland. Some of the other new faces include Josh Grizzard as the passing game coordinator, and Ryan Mahaffey as the Tight Ends Coach and running game coordinator.\n\nMannion has close connections to Mahaffey and Kuper already. Mahaffey coached with Mannion in Green Bay, and Kuper was a coach in Minnesota in 2023 while Mannion was still playing quarterback.\n\nThere’s been no indication of Jeff Stoutland’s next move yet. The term “leaving” indicates he may not be retiring, but he could instead try to coach elsewhere.\n\nSo what does this mean for Philadelphia’s offense? Well, big changes are still on the rise. With Dallas Goedert entering free agency and Dickerson still contemplating retirement, the Eagles’ offense could look much different than it has in recent history.\n\nFor now, however, it seems that Sean Mannion has the reins, and Sirianni is taking a step back in his offensive involvement. For better or for worse, the Mannion era is off to a polarizing start.\n\nThe post Jeff Stoutland’s Eagles Departure Signals Major Organizational Changes appeared first on The Lead.",

At 223 pounds, Brown would probably be a heavyweight.\n\nBrown has already initiated conversations with UFC CEO Dana White about potential opportunities in mixed martial arts, though he emphasized that any such move would come after his basketball career.\n\nBoston Celtics G/F Jaylen Brown says he would like to partake in the UFC or boxing post career 🤔\n\n\"Maybe post part of my career, I would love to partake in something like UFC or even boxing. I've talked to Dana White about some stuff\"#NBAAllStar26 pic.twitter.com/sBQTgICKZM\n\n— COMBAT SPORTS TODAY (@CSTodayNews) February 15, 2026\n\nBrown’s been all over the headlines this year, as his 2025-26 season has been a dominant display.\n\nThrough 49 games, Brown has averaged 29.3 points per game, ranking fourth league-wide, alongside 6.9 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.0 steals, and 0.4 blocks in 34.2 minutes. His shooting splits stand at 48.3% from the field, 34.8% from three, and 77.5% from the free-throw line.\n\nJB has been on a tear, scoring 20 or more points in 16 straight games. Earlier peaks included a 50-point explosion on January 3 and consistent double-digit rebounding outings. These career-high marks in scoring, rebounding, and assisting reflect his evolution into a more complete offensive force, helping Boston maintain a strong position heading into the All-Star break.\n\nNikola Jokic Talks Jaylen Brown’s MVP Candidacy",

    "description": "An enormous spinning hexagon in the clouds at Saturn’s north pole has fascinated observers since our first glimpse of it in the 1980s. The long-lived, symmetrical weather system – twice as wide as Earth – may have been spinning for centuries.",
    "fullText": "One of the most curious and captivating features on Saturn – an enormous spinning hexagon in the clouds at its north pole – has fascinated scientists and the public alike since our first glimpse of it in the 1980s.\n\nA trove of images and data from the Cassini probe that orbited Saturn from 2004-2017 provided some surprising answers, but not all of them, heightening the mystery even more.\n\nScientists first observed the six-sided jet stream when the two Voyager spacecraft passed by Saturn in 1980 and 1981. But their trajectories prevented the Voyagers from capturing the entire monstrous hexagon – twice as wide as Earth – in a single image from above. As they flew past, their viewing angle offered only tantalizing glimpses of its edge.\n\nMore than 20 years later, when Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004, the planet’s northern hemisphere was in winter and the hexagon was hidden in shadow. Because Saturn’s seasons last so much longer than those on Earth, scientists had to wait a few more years to see the hexagon in visible light.\n\nSo until then, they looked at it a different way.\n\nIn 2006 (still winter in Saturn’s north), Cassini’s team studied the hexagon using the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument on the spacecraft. VIMS could see the hexagon in the dark because it detects infrared wavelengths of light, basically heat generated in the warm interior of Saturn.\n\nSaturn is much farther from the Sun than Earth is, so its year – the time Saturn takes to complete one solar orbit – is about 29 Earth years. Consequently, each Saturnian season lasts more than seven Earth years.\n\nWhen Saturn approached its August 2009 equinox, spring – and sunlight – had arrived in the north and the wait was finally over. Cassini examined the hexagon with its main visible-light cameras, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). The ISS instrument had higher resolution than the VIMS instrument, and captured images in unprecedented detail.\n\nThose shots revealed a stunningly symmetric jet stream about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, with winds about 300 mph (500 kph). In addition, the hexagon spins around a tight vortex that marks Saturn’s north pole.\n\nThe hurricane-like vortex has an eye about 50 times larger than a typical Earth hurricane, and a maximum wind speed about double that of the strongest cyclones here.\n\n“This is the belly button of Saturn,” said VIMS scientist Kevin Baines, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Baines emphasized that, although it resembles a hurricane, Saturn’s north polar vortex is not the same thing because hurricanes on Earth feed on water and heat from Earth’s surface. “But it does have at least the structure of a hurricane, what we call the classic vortex.”\n\nThe hexagon itself, however, perplexed scientists. Baines called it “one of the biggest mysteries of the dynamics of Saturn.”\n\nThe hexagon has a diameter more than twice the width of Earth. Its  sides and angles are roughly symmetrical. For humans accustomed to weather on Earth, such an ordered, geometric pattern might seem curious, or even alien. Then again, maybe Earth is the oddball.\n\nOn Earth, jet streams slither and meander with no pattern or symmetry. Weather systems swirl and twirl throughout the globe. But while the atmospheres of both Saturn and Earth follow the same natural laws, different conditions produce different results.\n\nSunlight drives wind and weather patterns on Earth, and our planet is nearly 10 times closer to the Sun than Saturn is, which means we receive nearly 100 times more sunlight than Saturn. As the Earth spins, the energy it gets from the Sun varies more sharply from day to night than it does on Saturn. Earth’s surface is also non-uniform. We have water, land, ice, and snow, which heat and cool at different rates.\n\nEarth also has an extremely shallow atmosphere compared to Saturn’s, but with towering mountains reaching miles into the sky and disturbing atmospheric flow – the same way large stones in a shallow creek make the water churn and roll.\n\nIn short, Earth lacks the conditions for a jet stream to settle into a symmetric shape. But Saturn is a different story. The gas giant has no solid surface, and its composition is far more uniform.\n\nThere’s apparently nothing in Saturn’s atmosphere to keep a perfectly natural symmetric shape from forming. Scientists even duplicated the hexagon in a laboratory on Earth using a cylindrical tank of water on top of a slowly rotating table. They produced other shapes, too.\n\n“We can also get squares, octagons and other polygons – it depends on the speed and the different properties of the fluid,” Baines said.\n\nThat’s not to say scientists have Saturn’s hexagon all figured out. For some reason, Saturn has a hexagonal jet stream only in the north, not in the south. And while scientists have reproduced the hexagon in the lab, they don’t know why it’s so long-lived.\n\n“The hexagon is just a current of air, and weather features out there that share similarities to this are notoriously turbulent and unstable,” said Andrew Ingersoll, a Cassini imaging scientist from the California Institute of Technology. “A hurricane on Earth typically lasts a week, but this has been here for decades and, who knows, maybe centuries.”\n\nIn late 2012, Cassini began making swings over Saturn's poles, giving it the best views yet of the hexagon. The color-filter movie of the hexagon shown above was assembled from eight images Cassini captured over 10 hours on Dec.10, 2012.\n\n“The polar vortex at the hexagon's center – which was discovered by Cassini – is a bit of an enigma,” Baines said.\nThese highest-resolution views accentuated a wide variety of cloud structures within the hexagon. There’s the massive “hurricane” tightly centered on the north pole, and also numerous small vortices, appearing as reddish ovals. Some of those spin clockwise while the hexagon and hurricane spin counterclockwise. Some of those smaller features are swept along with the jet stream of the hexagon, as if on a racetrack. The biggest of these vortices, seen near the lower right corner of the hexagon and appearing whitish, spans about 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers), or about twice the size of the largest hurricane ever on Earth.\n\nAs Saturn’s year progressed, moving from spring toward the summer, the north pole heated up and Cassini showed the hexagon changing color. A bluish-green in 2013 turned to a yellowish haze by the planet’s summer solstice, on May 24, 2017. Solar radiation from the increasing sunlight was breaking apart methane molecules in the atmosphere, which then rearranged into hydrocarbon particles – akin to the formation of smog on Earth – and formed the yellow haze. Researchers found that small haze particles fill the inside of the hexagon, while larger particles dominate outside of it, with the inside and outside being separated by the jet stream that delineates the hexagon.\n\nAfter 20 years in space and 294 orbits around Saturn, Cassini exhausted its fuel supply. To avoid contaminating moons of Saturn that could have conditions suitable for life, Cassini’s mission team sent the probe on a daring final operation that would seal its fate. After a series of nearly two dozen nail-biting dives between the planet and the icy minefield of its rings, Cassini burned up in Saturn’s atmosphere on Sept. 15, 2017, returning science data to the very end.\n\nBefore Cassini’s Grand Finale, Baines was eager to see what further insights could come from the probe’s close-up views. “These last 22 orbits are giving us a unique chance to observe and analyze the hexagon in unprecedented detail,” he said.\n\nAnd researchers have continued poring over that data, long after Cassini’s end.\n\nGravity measurements made in Cassini's final orbits showed that the high winds at Saturn's cloud tops – up to 895 mph (1,440 kph) – persist far below, extending 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) toward the planet’s interior. Harvard researchers in 2020 used those findings to suggest that a deep supersonic jet stream is pinched on all sides by smaller cyclones and pushed upward, forming the hexagon.\n\nCassini project scientist Linda Spilker, of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said after the Grand Finale that she’s looking forward \"to seeing other new discoveries that remain to be found in the Cassini data.”\n\n“Even after Cassini’s 13 years in orbit around Saturn,” she said, “the mystery and extent of the hexagon continue to grow.”",

    "fullText": "The Phantom Corsair is a prototype automobile built in 1937.[4] It is a six-passenger 2-door sedan[1] that was designed by Rust Heinz of the H. J. Heinz family and Maurice Schwartz of the Bohman & Schwartz coachbuilding company in Pasadena, California.[5] Although sometimes dismissed as a failure because it never entered production, the Corsair is regarded as ahead of its time because of its futuristic features, and styling cues such as faired-in fenders and a low profile.[6]\n\nIt was shown to the local press in Pasadena in July 1937,[7] and first exhibited publicly at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on 15 February 1938,[8] with publicity including many construction details:\n\n“Streamlined to the ultimate—underneath as well as above—the body of the car covers wheels and eliminates necessity for fenders or running boards and thus makes possible a longer seat on which four people ride abreast. A rumble seat accommodates two passengers who face the rear…With a body of electrically welded aviation steel tubing - and an outer surface of alloy steel - and a passenger compartment lined with rubber composition, passengers ride in a scientifically safe ‘steel cage.’ Electric push buttons replace door handles, while the hood raises by an automatic trigger on the instrument panel, automatically switching on an engine service light. Seats are of solid cast rubber, eliminating seat springs. There is a ‘crash board,’ padded with cork and sponge rubber and covered with leather to minimize injury in case of accident. Layers of cork and rubber latex applied to the entire body of the car kill vibration and rumble at its source and eliminate all normal highway and engine noises. Indirect lighting features the car’s interior, while built-in headlights of enormous candlepower, with amber fog lights below, afford 180-degree highway illumination….The passenger section contains luxury compartments—one on either side of the rumble seat. There is an all-wave radio with twin speakers and an aviationtype aerial. Ceiling and sidewalls are lined with three-quarter inch light cork composition and layer of sponge rubber under upholstery of tufted design. The floor is acoustically treated with a layer of pulp composition, sprayed cork, rubber and floor carpet. Interior features are of dull finished chromium, and unprotruding. Air conditioning, which is additional, thermostatically controls cold and heat producing units.”[9]\n\nThe Phantom Corsair's steel-and-aluminum body measured just 57 in (140 cm) in height and incorporated fully skirted wheels and completely flush fenders while forgoing running boards.[10] The car also lacked door handles, as the doors were instead opened electrically using push-buttons located on the exterior and the instrument panel.[10][11] The instrument panel also featured a compass and altimeter, while a separate console above the windshield indicated when a door was ajar or if the car's lights or radio were turned on.[10] The Corsair's body was mated to the \"most advanced chassis available in the United States\" at that time, the Cord 810.[5] The Lycoming 80º V-8 engine-powered Cord chassis also featured front-wheel drive and an electrically operated four-speed pre-selector gearbox, as well as fully independent suspension and adjustable shock absorbers.[2][3][5][11][nb 1] Though these features from the Cord 810 chassis were all retained on the Phantom Corsair, the chassis was modified in order to accommodate the Corsair's large body.[5] The body measured an impressive 237 in (600 cm) long and 76.5 in (194 cm) wide, enough to accommodate four people in the front row, including one person to the left of the driver.[10][11] The back seats could only hold two passengers, however, in large part because of space limitations posed by on-board beverage cabinets.[10][11] Though weighing a hefty 4,600 lb (2,100 kg), the Phantom Corsair could achieve speeds of up to 115 mph (185 km/h) because of its modified, naturally aspirated 125 bhp Lycoming engine as well as its aerodynamic shape.[2][11]\n\nRust Heinz planned to put the Phantom Corsair, which cost approximately $24,000 to produce in 1938[11] (equivalent to about $370,000 in 2010), into limited production at an estimated selling price of $12,500.[5] However, Heinz's death in a car accident in July 1939 ended those plans, leaving the prototype Corsair as the only one ever built.[10]\n\nThe Phantom Corsair now resides in the National Automobile Museum (also known as The Harrah Collection) in Reno, Nevada.[5][10][11]",

    "description": "Because employees could do more, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees' to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.",
    "fullText": "The most seductive narrative in American work culture right now isn’t that AI will take your job. It’s that AI will save you from it.\n\nThat’s the version the industry has spent the last three years selling to millions of nervous people who are eager to buy it. Yes, some white-collar jobs will disappear. But for most other roles, the argument goes, AI is a force multiplier. You become a more capable, more indispensable lawyer, consultant, writer, coder, financial analyst — and so on. The tools work for you, you work less hard, everybody wins.\n\nBut a new study published in Harvard Business Review follows that premise to its actual conclusion, and what it finds there isn’t a productivity revolution. It finds companies are at risk of becoming burnout machines.\n\nAs part of what they describe as “in-progress research,” UC Berkeley researchers spent eight months inside a 200-person tech company watching what happened when workers genuinely embraced AI. What they found across more than 40 “in-depth” interviews was that nobody was pressured at this company. Nobody was told to hit new targets. People just started doing more because the tools made more feel doable. But because they could do these things, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees’ to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.\n\nAs one engineer told them, “You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less. But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”\n\nOver on the tech industry forum Hacker News, one commenter had the same reaction, writing, “I feel this. Since my team has jumped into an AI everything working style, expectations have tripled, stress has tripled and actual productivity has only gone up by maybe 10%. It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”\n\nIt’s fascinating and also alarming. The argument about AI and work has always stalled on the same question — are the gains real? But too few have stopped to ask what happens when they are.\n\nThe researchers’ new findings aren’t entirely novel. A separate trial last summer found experienced developers using AI tools took 19% longer on tasks while believing they were 20% faster. Around the same time, a National Bureau of Economic Research study tracking AI adoption across thousands of workplaces found that productivity gains amounted to just 3% in time savings, with no significant impact on earnings or hours worked in any occupation. Both studies have gotten picked apart.\n\nThis one may be harder to dismiss because it doesn’t challenge the premise that AI can augment what employees can do on their own. It confirms it, then shows where all that augmentation actually leads, which is “fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,” according to the researchers.\n\nThe industry bet that helping people do more would be the answer to everything, but it may turn out to be the beginning of a different problem entirely. The research is worth reading, here.",

    "fullText": "No, Disney did not release footage of a never-before-seen fight sequence between Marvel's Wolverine and Thanos (spoiler: Thanos won).\n\nThat clip, which amassed over 142,000 views on X over 48 hours, was created using Seedance 2.0, an AI video generation model that ByteDance debuted last week. The tool created a buzz on social media, where one user made a hyperrealistic AI video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting over Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nByteDance's decision to let users create content based on Disney's IP without permission isn't all that surprising given the AI industry's well-established strategy to \"ask for forgiveness, not permission.\"\n\nDisney, which is infamous for aggressively protecting its intellectual property, isn't having it — though how it responds to the threats is not always the same.\n\nOn Friday, the entertainment company sent ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns Seedance and TikTok, a cease-and-desist letter, a source familiar with the matter confirmed for Business Insider.\n\nIn the letter, Disney accused ByteDance of supplying Seedance 2.0 with \"a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art.\"\n\n\"Over Disney's well-publicized objections, ByteDance is hijacking Disney's characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters,\" the letter said.\n\nSeedance is only the latest AI company Disney says is ripping it off.\n\nDisney and NBCUniversal sued Midjourney, an AI image generator, in June last year. In the lawsuit, the companies compared Midjourney's tech to \"a virtual vending machine, generating endless unauthorized copies of Disney's and Universal's copyrighted works.\"\n\nThen Disney accused Character.AI of copyright infringement in a September cease-and-desist letter last September. In December, it sent one to Google in response to the AI image generator Nano Banana Pro and its other AI models, accusing the Big Tech giant of stealing its IP on a \"massive scale.\" Both companies have since removed Disney characters from their platforms.\n\nDisney is not anti-AI, however, and its strategy is not one-size-fits-all. The company took a much less adversarial approach with OpenAI, the world's leading AI startup.\n\nWhen OpenAI debuted Sora 2, an AI-powered text-to-video platform, in September, users began uploading IP-heavy content featuring Disney characters to social media. Instead of a cease-and-desist letter or legal action, though, Disney negotiated a deal.\n\nAlthough Disney hasn't shared plans to develop its own AI model or video generator, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company ultimately sees the tech not as a threat but as a new path to connect with audiences.\n\nDuring an earnings call late last year, he said AI would \"provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content, and to consume user-generated content, mostly short form, from others.\"",

    "description": "After helping her mom downsize, a parent explains why she's decluttering now to spare her kids the burden of managing her belongings later.",
    "fullText": "I've seen multiple articles lately about the boomer avalanche — all this stuff people have — and their kids not wanting it. I'm not a boomer, but at 46, I'm already aware that I have too much stuff.\n\nThree recent events made me think about the burden our possessions would place on our kids if something happened to us. So I started decluttering so they don't have to deal with my stuff.\n\nThe first event was helping my mom downsize.\n\nShe moved from a 2,000-square-foot townhome into a much smaller rental home. Doing a pre-move assessment, it was clear that all her stuff wouldn't fit in the new place.\n\nShe saw it as an opportunity and spent two months purging, donating, and selling items.\n\nWhen scoping out storage spots in her new home, my mom shared that she has a stack of boxes of stuff from her mom's house. She doesn't want it, but doesn't feel like she can get rid of it, and has been holding onto it since her mom passed over 10 years ago.\n\nMy kids made sure grandma didn't get rid of her little rocking chair. They both have memories of climbing on it at Grandma's house. It's now in our living room.\n\nDecorating our house for the holidays was the second event that confirmed we have too much stuff.\n\nEvery year, my husband goes into our crawl space and hauls out a full 19 boxes of holiday decor — trees, lights, ceramic villages, wrapping paper. Our house ends up covered with holidays.\n\nThis year, when decorating, I decided to downsize and packed a giant box with ornaments, tablecloths, mugs, and random decorations we haven't put up in years.\n\nDuring this process, I was reminded how important it is to check before donating. My husband noticed a few decorations from his mom in the \"donation box.\" We're keeping them. We may not display them, but there are memories in those figurines.\n\nI asked my kids what they wanted us to keep for them. Stockings, our Advent calendar, and the holiday village — each of them had items they associated with their holiday memories. These things will never go into the donation box.\n\nDuring our remodel last year — event three — my youngest and I learned how much the things we have sitting on a shelf can mean to someone else. My child's donation of stuffed animals made a huge difference to volunteers and children at a local soup kitchen.\n\nWe had a repeat experience this year, but this time with tablecloths. I have too many tablecloths. The last count was over 20. Even if I can't get laundry done for weeks, that is many more than we need. I challenged myself to get rid of half of them.\n\nA friend who volunteers at a shelter and soup kitchen happily took the donation. A few weeks later, we learned those tablecloths had a new life as blankets for a family of four who were living in their car at the time.\n\nRemodeling our house was the most eye-opening demonstration of how many things we have. Our storage space is still crammed with stuff that didn't make it back into the house after the remodel.\n\nFinding a place for everything during the renovation was a huge challenge. We quickly realized we couldn't fit 50% of our belongings (three bedrooms and my office) in the other 50% of our house.\n\nTaking up the most space — the items in my closet, which filled my entire soccer-mom-sized SUV.\n\nSo today, for every new thing I add, I donate at least two items. I've designated a section of my closet for things I haven't worn, and when the seasons change, anything in that section goes. And — the most fun — I invite friends to come \"shop\" in my closet.\n\nIn my office are multiple items that remind me of my grandma.\n\nOne of my favorite memories is being at her house, spending hours poring over her high school and college yearbooks.\n\nWhen it was clear the end was near for her, she had me take those yearbooks from the nursing home. She barely remembered who she was, but she remembered how much those books meant to me.\n\nSeeing those yearbooks evokes memories of her, keeping her alive in my mind. But they are my memories of her, not my kids'.\n\nAnd that's really the thing, isn't it? Wrapped up in all this stuff are memories and maybe a bit of guilt about getting rid of it.\n\nSo, I will keep cleaning out that closet, clearing out the storage unit, and reducing our holiday decor, but one day, my kids may have to get rid of those yearbooks.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic famously employs a Scottish philosopher named Amanda Askell.\n\nHer job is to imbue its chatbot, Claude, with a personality and a set of moral guardrails. She is essentially teaching it to be cool and good.\n\nElon Musk, however, doesn't think she's qualified.\n\n\"Those without children lack a stake in the future,\" Musk posted on X in response to a profile of Askell published by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Journal profile does not say whether Askell has kids. Musk, who has imbued his own chatbot, Grok, with a distinct personality, has 14 of them. Musk is known for promoting a brand of pronatalism that's become popular among Silicon Valley elites.\n\nAskell responded with her trademark dry intellectualism.\n\n\"I think it depends on how much you care about people in general vs. your own kin,\" Askell wrote. \"I do intend to have kids, but I still feel like I have a strong personal stake in the future because I care a lot about people thriving, even if they're not related to me.\"\n\n\"I think caring about your children can make you feel invested in the future in a new and very profound way, and I do understand people wanting to convey that,\" she added.\n\nThe responses to their short back-and-forth were as varied as you might expect on Musk's social media network. A day later, Askell posted again.\n\n\"I'm too right wing for the left and I'm too left wing for the right,\" she said. \"I'm too into humanities for those in tech and I'm too into tech for those in the humanities.

    "description": "Browsing jobs in Phuket became Cheska Hull's guilty pleasure. When she called off her wedding, she decided it was time to move to Thailand.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cheska Hull, 40, a British reality TV star and PR professional who relocated to Phuket. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy move to Phuket was about choosing a fabulous place to live while continuing my freelance career.\n\nI feel like I've been part of the island's community for years. I'd visit annually for a couple of weeks at a time, maintain friendships, and get to know local business owners.\n\nEvery trip had me dreaming about potential jobs and interesting opportunities. I'm a PR specialist who has always worked in the luxury sector, across food, beverage, and hospitality. In London, I specialized in private members' clubs.\n\nThat work also led me into radio and television, where I starred in the reality show \"Made in Chelsea\" for nearly four years. It helped me understand the evolving world of influencers and celebrities. Having lived on both sides of the PR and fame spectrum, I gained a deep understanding of that industry.\n\nMy parents lived in Phuket in the 1980s, when my dad was head of Standard Chartered Bank for Phuket, which is why I was born here. We moved back to England when I was young.\n\nBeing born in Thailand didn't simplify moving back as an expat. I still had to go through all the same steps as everyone else.\n\nInitially, I came on a DTV digital nomad visa while freelancing for my UK clients. I told all of them, \"I want to live in Thailand. That's my dream.\"\n\nI wanted the best of both worlds.\n\nI've always been drawn to the famous Thai \"sabai sabai\" — take-it-easy — lifestyle. But when it comes to business, I'm driven. I could never just move to Phuket and not work.\n\nEven between projects, I was constantly networking, talking to people, and pushing for collaborations with brands I'd worked with before. Now, I get to do what I've always loved in a place I love.\n\nMy son was also at the right age for a big change. As a single mom, the stress came from knowing how significant the move was and wondering, \"Have I made the right decision?\" My main priority in life is his happiness.\n\nIf he hadn't been happy, I don't think we would have stayed. But he's 8, and he was able to fit in quickly — learning some Thai at school and thriving.\n\nThere was another catalyst, too. At the time, I was engaged to be married and realized that wasn't the path for me anymore. Once I called off the wedding, the door felt wide open.\n\nBrowsing jobs in Phuket started as a guilty pleasure. Through meeting people and networking, someone told me about a new opening at Anantara, a hotel I already knew well. It seemed perfect. And so now, as cluster director of public relations, I have a work permit.\n\nI've had to quickly learn Thai workplace customs, like addressing colleagues respectfully using \"khun\" before names or navigating the widespread use of nicknames. It's about understanding a different culture and being respectful within it.\n\nOne of my favorite rituals happens every Friday during my team's morning meeting. We go outside to a huge tree in front of the hotel with two spirit houses. We all take incense, make a prayer, and privately speak to the spirits. It's so different and unique, I find it special.\n\nIt's a meaningful part of their culture that I've come to love. I can't imagine trying to get everyone in London to do that, they'd laugh.\n\nThere haven't been many hard parts to settling in. The main challenge of living on a small, seasonal island like Phuket is traffic. You get used to a calm pace, and then suddenly there's a massive influx of people. But that comes with the territory in hospitality and tourism, which is ultimately what we want here.\n\nMy move to Thailand is long-term. Looking back, there was an element of risk. I came with a bit of an \"Eat, Pray, Love\" vision. I knew I loved it here and wanted it to work, but I also told myself, \"If it doesn't, you can just go back.\"\n\nFor me, the quality of life, the people, the food, the weather — just about everything about Phuket — makes it a place I want to call home forever. Island life simply couldn't be better right now.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad? Contact the editor at akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "\"If history itself had wings, it would probably be this aircraft,\" Vice President Al Gore said of the SAM 26000 Air Force One plane upon its retirement in 1998.\n\nThe first Air Force jet designed and built specifically for US presidents, SAM 26000 (pronounced two six thousand) carried eight presidents between 1962 and 1998 — every leader from John F. Kennedy to Bill Clinton.\n\nAfter 13,000 flying hours over 36 years of service, the plane was retired to the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, where it remains on display.\n\nI visited the museum in August and walked through the historic aircraft. Take a look inside.\n\nThe Boeing VC-137C was a customized and modified version of a civilian 707-320B airliner. It was powered by four Pratt & Whitney TF33 engines, each with 18,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nThe first lady also added the words \"United States of America\" to the aircraft to signal its importance as the president's plane.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president aboard the plane hours after Kennedy was pronounced dead.\n\nAdmission to the National Museum of the US Air Force is free.\n\nSAM 26000 is located in the museum's William E. Boeing Presidential Gallery, which includes other presidential planes such as the Douglas VC-54C, the first presidential aircraft, which was known as the \"Sacred Cow.\"\n\nThe crew consisted of a pilot, copilot, navigator, and flight engineer. The navigator and flight engineer roles were eventually replaced by GPS and computerized technology on later Air Force One planes.\n\nA plaque above the phones read, \"This telephone is subject to monitoring at all times. Use of this telephone constitutes consent to monitoring.\"\n\nThe closet also had a rack to hang suits and coats.\n\nThe secure communication center allowed presidents to place calls anywhere in the world while in flight.\n\nThe galley included a stovetop, oven, and sink.\n\nThe aircraft could hold up to 40 passengers.\n\nThe seating area, like many areas of the plane, is now protected by plastic barricades.\n\nStationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, the 89th Airlift Wing is tasked with flying the president and high-ranking government officials. The group is also referred to as \"SAM FOX,\" which stands for \"Special Air Missions Foreign.\"\n\nThe benches in the hallway were hollow to offer additional storage.\n\nIn 1969, Nixon redesigned Air Force One and moved the presidential quarters over the wings, which was the quietest and smoothest part of the plane during flight.\n\nPresidents used the white phone to communicate with crew members and other passengers on the plane, while the beige phone could be used to call anywhere in the world.\n\nThe room was furnished with throne chairs, a folding table, and another TV.\n\nPresidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter sat here while flying to attend Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat's funeral in 1981.\n\nPresidents used the electric typewriter to write and edit speeches while on board the plane.\n\nThe wall of the office space was decorated with a map of the United States.\n\nKennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, while visiting Dallas. He was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital at 1 p.m., and Johnson took the oath of office at 2:38 p.m.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's pink suit was still smeared with blood when Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes administered the oath of office on Air Force One. Johnson's wife, Lady Bird Johnson, stood to his right.\n\nEven blocked off by plastic barricades, the plane's cabin preserves a pivotal moment in US history.\n\nThe Secret Service had to break the handles off the casket to make it fit through the plane door.\n\nThe seating area featured six seats, a phone, and a folding table.\n\nAccording to US Flag Code, an American flag decal must always be positioned so that the stars face forward.\n\nLike many modes of presidential transportation, such as the bulletproof limousine known as \"The Beast\" and the Marine One helicopter, Air Force One is about more than simply getting the president from point A to point B. It symbolizes the power of the United States and its elected leader wherever it goes.\n\nThe image projected by presidential planes remains of great interest to President Donald Trump, who opted to accept a luxurious Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family instead of waiting for Boeing to deliver its long-delayed new Air Force One jets.",

We need a change,'\" Orsi said.\n\nIn August 2024, the family packed up their bags and moved to Hangzhou, a bustling city in eastern China.\n\nChina had been on their radar for a long time, though neither of them had visited before.\n\nIt wasn't until Sleight came across an online job ad for a teaching role in Hangzhou that they began looking into the city.\n\n\"I was impressed with the natural beauty and how modern the city appeared. I knew China was very well connected by the railway infrastructure, so I wasn't overly concerned about the location,\" Sleight, 45, told Business Insider.\n\nThe couple looped their kids, who are now 11, 9, and 7, into the conversation about moving to China early. \"We wanted to give them lots of time to process and to get an understanding of what was happening,\" she said.\n\n\"We have a philosophy that we talk to our children, and we keep them informed about the decisions we make,\" Orsi said.\n\nTo ease the transition, they showed their kids YouTube videos about China and the school they would attend.\n\nWhen they arrived in Hangzhou, Orsi said their first impressions quickly put any lingering nerves at ease.\n\n\"We were actually quite shocked to see how clean, how modern, how organized, and how convenient everything is,\" Orsi said. \"Sometimes you watch videos, but unless you're actually in it, you can't really understand it to that degree until it affects your life.\"\n\nTheir children attend an international school, and Sleight teaches English in the school's bilingual program.\n\nHouse-hunting was a breeze because the school put them in contact with a real-estate agent ahead of their move.\n\n\"We wanted to have a bedroom for each of the kids, and we were looking for amenities,\" she said. \"Most importantly, we wanted to be close to the school.\"\n\nWithin 10 days of arriving in China, the family moved into a four-bedroom apartment. It's about a five-minute drive from the school and roughly 50 minutes outside the city center, in a neighborhood dominated by local Chinese families.\n\nRent is 5,500 Chinese yuan, or about $790 a month, and is covered by the school as part of Sleight's employment contract.\n\nEven with a growing foreign community, the transition isn't always easy.\n\n\"During staff meetings and presentations, I wear an earpiece and listen to a live translation provided by the school's professional translator,\" he said. Sleight added that parents and staff also communicate through a messaging app with built-in translation.\n\n\"If anything were to go wrong, the issue would be resolved very, very quickly. So the children, they can be outside on their own,\" Orsi said. She added that she probably wouldn't feel comfortable giving her kids the same level of freedom even in Townsville, a city in North Queensland, where they lived before moving to Qatar.\n\nIt's also common to see children wearing kid-friendly smartwatches, which let them be more independent.\n\n\"You can see their location, they can call you, they can pay for things, and so they can go anywhere. They'll organize their own play dates and go and meet their friends,\" she said.\n\nAs a woman, Orsi also feels safe walking alone, including from the train station late at night. \"I have not thought about it twice. I wouldn't do it in Australia. And I wouldn't do it in Argentina, where I'm from,\" she said. Orsi moved to Australia in her teens and later met Sleight while working at a telecommunications company.\n\nIt took a year, but Orsi says the family finally feels settled in their new home. Most of their social circle has grown out of the school community, including other parents and foreign teachers.\n\nThe longer school days have also given Orsi more time for herself. She said she's picked up new hobbies, including learning to play the piano, going to the gym, and focusing on content creation for their YouTube channel, where she and Sleight document their family life in China.\n\nSleight is on a three-year contract at the school. As for what comes next, Orsi said the family hasn't made any firm decisions.\n\n\"I think we would probably like to move elsewhere and go to another country when our contract is up, but that could change,\" she said. \"We may very well decide to stay in China and move to another school or experience a different city.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city?

    "fullText": "Donegal maintained their perfect record in Division One, making it three wins from three with a comfortable 1-19 to 0-14 win over Mayo at a sold-out O'Donnell Park.\n\nA second half Armagh rally was not enough as they slipped to a second straight defeat in Division One, going down 3-18 to 0-24 to Roscommon in Dr Hyde Park.\n\nTyrone banked their first win in Division Two as Malachy O'Rourke's side impressed in a 2-23 to 1-14 win over Cavan, who are joint bottom of the table with Offaly.\n\nIn Division Three, Fermanagh are adrift at the bottom as their 2-18 to 0-18 defeat by Clare at Brewster Park leaves Declan Bonner's side without anything to show after three games.\n\nIt's the same story for Antrim in Division Four as Mark Doran's side are without anything to show from their three games with Longford powering to a 1-27 to 1-14 win in Portglenone.\n\nIt took nine minutes for the first score of the game to arrive in Letterkenny.\n\nAfter a cagey start, two efforts apiece from Conor McCahill and Oisin Gallen saw Donegal race into an early lead.\n\nRyan O'Donoghue finally got Mayo off the mark on 16 minutes with a two-point free, but it would take 27 minutes for the Connacht men to register a score from play.\n\nGallen landed five points of his own throughout the half as Donegal went in leading 0-11 to 0-5 at the break.\n\nMayo had chances to reduce the arrears early in the second half but Darragh Beirne, Conor Loftus and Ryan O'Donoghue all had goal chances well saved by Gavin Mulreaney.\n\nRyan McHugh floated over a superb two pointer to re-establish Donegal's six-point advantage before Paedar Mogan set up Conor O'Donnell to punch to the back of the net.\n\nMcCahill and Finbarr Roarty added scores to give Donegal a 1-16 to 0-8 lead midway through the second half.\n\nAndy Moran's side replied with three scores in a row before Beirne was once again denied a sure goal as Mulreaney made a brave save from close range.\n\nLate scores from McCahill and O'Donnell sealed a comfortable win for Jim McGuinness' side ahead of their trip to take on Armagh next weekend.\n\nA disallowed goal in the second half from Armagh's Ross McQuillan ultimately proved fatal, but Roscommon's platform for victory was built in the first half.\n\nA two-pointer from Diarmuid Murtagh in the opening minute set the tone as after Oisin O'Neill opened Armagh's account at the other end, the Roscommon captain was put through for a third-minute goal.\n\nIt would get better for the hosts as Blaine Hughes' subsequent kick-out went awry and Enda Smith was put in to thump home.\n\nThe sides traded a pair of scores before Murtagh kicked another two-pointer, while the crossbar denied Dylan Ruane a third goal for the hosts.\n\nStill, they pushed further clear with a Daire Cregg free and a third Murtagh two-pointer - this time from a free - before Armagh briefly rallied with points from Cian McConville and Ross McQuillan.\n\nHowever, a two-pointer from Cregg and a further two scores extended the gap to 14 before Armagh enjoyed a decent spell with three points, but a Cregg free on the stroke of half-time left Roscommon with a commanding 2-14 to 0-8 advantage.\n\nSmith extended the gap straight after the break, but Armagh roared back with the next six points, including back-to-back two-pointers from Oisin O'Neill.\n\nThe Orchardmen thought they were right back in it in the 47th minute when McQuillan crashed home, but the goal was ruled out as his side had left less than four players in their own half and instead of a four-point gap, it was eight with Murtagh tapping over a free in front of the posts.\n\nThis four-point swing was ultimately crucial but so too was Roscommon's third goal in the 61st minute.\n\nWith just six between them, substitutes combined as Jack Duggan sent a ball inside for Paul Carey to palm home, but Armagh were not done and two-pointers from O'Neill and McConville either side of a Tomas McCormack point brought them to within four.\n\nThey had a big goal chance with minutes to play when Jason Duffy fed inside to McConville, but he could only divert into the arms of Aaron Brady.\n\nArmagh kept pressing, but a Greg McCabe shot whistled over at the death as they slipped to defeat with Roscommon making it back-to-back wins over Ulster opposition.\n\nDarragh Canavan struck nine points a man of the match display as Tyrone secured their first win of the campaign with a commanding victory over Cavan.\n\nThe Red Hands recovered from a shaky start to take over in the second period and with 12 different scorers, they will be happy with their day's work against Dermot McCabe's men, who are still without a point on the board.\n\nCavan enjoyed a good start as, after Eoin McElholm kicked the first of his four points for Tyrone, Oisin Brady nailed a two-point free for the Breffni men, who then had a goal as Tiernan Madden finished from close range.\n\nHowever, Tyrone responded well with the nest three scores and although Peter Corrigan and Gerard Smith hit back, the game was level in the 17th minute as Brian Kennedy took a pass from Seanie O'Donnell and lashed home.\n\nIt remained even heading to the break but Tyrone finished strong with Kennedy turning provider for Mattie Donnelly to hit Tyrone's second goal and a Canavan point straight after opened a 2-8 to 1-7 lead at the break.\n\nCavan introduced Paddy Lynch at the break and he carried most of the fight in the second period with five points, but his side could not gain any real momentum as Tyrone began to pull away.\n\nA two-pointer from Canavan seemed to kick the Red Hands' surge with Cavan goalkeeper Liam Brady called into action on a couple of occasions, tipping a McElholm shot over and then saving from O'Donnell with Ben Cullen fisting over the rebound.\n\nThe scores continued to flow for the hosts, who outscored their Ulster rivals by 11 points to three in the final quarter as they breathed life into their campaign with Cavan, who lost Brady to a black card in the dying moments, now in a relegation battle.\n\nGoals from Aaron Griffin and Daniel Walsh were the difference in Clare's victory in Enniskillen as Fermanagh prop up Division Three.\n\nIt was an even start to the game with a Ciaran O'Hanlon two-pointer helping Fermangh into a narrow lead before they were hit for the first of the Clare goals as they coughed up possession and Eoin Cleary found Griffin to fire home after 12 minutes.\n\nA two-point free from Garvan Jones following a point by Clare's Mark McInerney, as Fermanagh pushed on with a two-pointer by Darragh McGurn helping them into the lead, but Cleary found a two-pointer of his own as Clare led 1-10 to 0-10 at the break.\n\nFermanagh made a flying start to the second period with the first five scores, but Clare rallied and led by three with McInerney and Cleary to the fore.\n\nThe hosts brought it back to one through Ronan McCaffrey and Josh Largo Ellis, but they failed to recover from Walsh's goal in the 60th minute as Clare secured their first win to leave Fermanagh in trouble at the bottom.\n\nIt was another day to forget for Antrim, who were soundly beaten by Longford in Portglenone.\n\nThe Saffrons opened well with Adam Loughran on target, but the visitors took command with Oran Kenny and Matthew Carey proving a thorn in the side of Mark Doran's men.\n\nLongford were six to the good when Loughran found the net for Antrim in the 21st minute, but it failed to ignite their challenge as the long-range ability of Kenny, Carey and Dessie Reynolds helped the Leinster side into a 0-19 to 1-4 lead at the break.\n\nAntrim did make a fight of it in the second half with Loughran, Niall Burns, Ryan McQuillan, Dominic McEnhill and Ryan Murray on target, but they were unable to assert real pressure on their visitors with Reynolds and Joseph Hagan keeping the board ticking before the issue was put beyond doubt with Carey striking home a 61st-minute penalty.\n\nLate two-pointers from Antrim's Pat Shivers served to add some respectability to the board, but the Saffrons find themselves bottom of Division Four on score difference from Waterford.",

    "title": "Three years on, Deulofeu is still fighting for 'miracle' return",
    "description": "Gerard Deulofeu has not played for more than three years but believes he can make \"history\" by fighting for a \"miracle\" comeback.",
    "fullText": "The years have ticked by, three of them since he last kicked a ball, but every day spent grafting in the gym is one Gerard Deulofeu believes he is a step closer to a \"miracle\".\n\n\"One of the things I get energy from is that I know I can make history,\" says the 31-year-old, whose last appearance for Udinese was in January 2023.\n\nFootball is his passion, his job. It is the game that took him to Barcelona's famed La Masia academy as a child and European glory as an adult. To the FA Cup final and the unbridled pride of scoring for his country. Tying full-backs in knots from Milan to Merseyside.\n\nDeulofeu desperately wants to feel that rush again, to complete what he feels would be the longest recovery ever.\n\nBut there was a time, the hardest time in those more than 1,100 days since his injury, where he could not walk with his kids, take the dogs out, drive the car.\n\nWhat Deulofeu really missed then were the simple things.\n\n\"I lost all my personal life,\" he says. \"That's the most hurtful thing that you can feel.\n\n\"Now I am just waiting to do a miracle to be back playing football. But I know it is so difficult to come back with that type of incapacity.\"\n\nDeulofeu squeezes each hand into a fist and crunches his knuckles together to replicate his right knee. \"My two bones,\" he grimaces. \"They are shocking.\"\n\nThe former Spain winger had already spent two months recovering from what he did not realise was an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury sustained before Serie A broke up for the World Cup, when his short-lived return happened.\n\nAfter coming off the bench against Sampdoria some 37 months ago, he could feel the knee giving way and asked to be taken off.\n\n\"I played 15 minutes,\" says Deulofeu. \"And there, in that 15 minutes, the ACL was completely broken. That was my last game.\"\n\nHad it just been a case of fixing his ACL - and Deulofeu stresses that is a \"crazy\" injury in itself, but one from which most modern footballers recover - he would have been back representing I Bianconeri more than two years ago.\n\nIndeed, the winger successfully returned eight months after a previous ACL tear at Watford in 2020.\n\n\"You do the surgery and you change your ACL, your system, and you do a progressive recovery,\" he says. \"But the problem was the infection.\"\n\nThat infection ate away at the cartilage in his knee, each scan showing it progressively deteriorating, reducing Deulofeu to the feeling of bone on bone.\n\n\"I wasn't the luckiest person,\" he shrugs.\n\nHe has consulted fellow Spaniard Santi Cazorla, who was sidelined for 636 days after gangrene ravaged his Achilles tendon, and takes inspiration from the former Arsenal midfielder's comeback.\n\n\"It is an amazing example,\" says Deulofeu. \"To imagine how he suffered in these two years and a half, I can feel it now.\"\n\nDeulofeu's first step was to have cell treatment in an attempt to rebuild the cartilage, but he faced a setback after attempting to run again.\n\n\"My knee needed to heal,\" he explains. \"To train hard, first you have to heal.\"\n\nAlmost two years later, having continued with injections for his cell treatment, he believes he is close to trying to run once more.\n\nIt is a product of what Deulofeu says was six months of building \"muscle, muscle, muscle\" in the gym, working with a physio and fitness trainer for three to four hours every morning, five days a week at Udinese's Stadio Friuli.\n\n\"Let's see if I can accept impact,\" he says. \"I am so happy because I feel the leg is really strong. The more muscle you get, the less pain you have inside the knee, so now I feel that, yes, my knee is prepared to run.\n\n\"I am feeling that I am close. If we speak about muscle, I am in the same levels of the available guys now.\n\n\"But let's see how they respond, with no cartilage and no meniscus...\"\n\nDeulofeu admits there were times he felt like quitting, but he remains remarkably upbeat and focused on his goal of returning to professional football.\n\n\"There are three really important things,\" he explains. \"One, for sure, is family and home. To try to go ahead with this period, first of all your home has to be with peace and love every morning.\n\n\"Happiness, seeing your kids growing, with your wife, really good peace and love at home. That's really important to go to training every day with a good mood.\"\n\nOne positive Deulofeu takes from this period is that he can enjoy more time with his family than is afforded to most professional footballers.\n\n\"In those three years I am out of my work, my passion, I can see how good it is just being at home,\" he says.\n\n\"Just being with your family, with your kids, looking at them growing and being a father, because with football you lose a lot of good periods, good moments.\n\n\"There are a lot of games now in modern football, every three or four days you play, and your kids are growing so fast.\"\n\nHis three children, though, are also the main fuel for Deulofeu to want to play football again - he wants them to be able to share those memories with them.\n\n\"My big daughter is eight years old and she is playing football, and my son is five and also playing football,\" he explains. \"Now they are telling me: 'When are you going to get back? I want to go with you to the stadium!'\n\n\"That type of history with the kids, that gives me the power to continue and to fight for being there with them, enjoy that moment with them now they are older.\"\n\nThe second reason Deulofeu gives is his relationship with the club and the Pozzo family, who brought him to Watford and then Udinese.\n\nBoth parties agreed to end his contract when it became clear Deulofeu would be sidelined indefinitely, but Udinese have provided him with the facilities to continue his recovery.\n\nIn return, he is passionate about wanting to represent them again.\n\nFinally, he is a self-confessed fitness obsessive. Deulofeu can be seen studying the science behind his recovery while recuperating in oxygen machines or during rest periods.\n\n\"I am really interested in everything about health,\" he says. \"So I'm enjoying being healthy, you know?\n\n\"Being positive helps me to see life in other ways. I cannot think 'oh, it happens to me, I'm so unlucky'. OK, maybe yes, but I prefer to think in another way, my mind being clear and clean to go and suffer every morning - if not, you are completely out.\"\n\nHe spends his time at the club \"with a smile, with my team-mates, giving them advice\". He adds: \"Just enjoying my recovery, seeing my improvements, I can feel more positive.\"\n\nHe is grateful too this layoff has come towards the back end of his career. With 350 club games spanning the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, as well as four Spain caps, he has fulfilled a goal of which most only dream.\n\n\"Imagine if that type of injury happens when you are young? You are completely gone, your career,\" he says.\n\n\"So I am grateful to play this career with AC Milan, Barcelona, Everton, Sevilla... I won the Europa League, I play for my national team, I score. What can you demand more?\n\n\"Let's see now if I can continue my career or just be grateful to be part of 10, 12 years in that amazing sport.\"\n\nAfter the interview wraps up, Deulofeu has another hour and a half on the bike to complete, before switching back into father mode - the kids need picking up from school and his son has training in the evening.\n\nHe gets too nervous to watch Udinese in the stadiums at weekends, plus he must rest for another hard week of training, but loves witnessing his children playing football.\n\n\"Seriously, I am there for two hours because I am so proud,\" he beams. \"My kids' game is my game!\n\n\"Sometimes the coaches tell me 'come here to the pitch and lend them some advice'. It's funny, it's good. How to put the foot, how to pass. It is beautiful.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "description": "One word to remember: contagion.",
    "fullText": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can \nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nI am getting some friendly heat from all of you about a video I posted on X.com Friday before 6 a.m.\n\nWhat are Wall Street strategists saying about contagion risks?\n\nHow is market contagion spreading beyond software stocks?\n\nWhat is causing the software stock crash?\n\nHow might AI infrastructure spending affect markets?\n\nIt was actually live — I began rolling from inside Yahoo Finance HQ around 5:30 a.m. with a full stream of consciousness on the software stock crash. If you are up before 6 a.m. studying stocks and reading news, I promise to be doing more live moments like this in the weeks ahead.\n\nNow, some of you appear not to have liked that I called this a \"crash\" in software stocks. How else could you characterize it, I mean, really? I'm not being alarmist!\n\nWorkday (WDAY) is down 30% in a month despite zero indications that the company will go out of business in 2027 because of an Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) model update.\n\nSend me a different word to use, and I'll use it. And don't tell me it's a \"pullback.\"\n\nMeanwhile, others were hoping I would hop to the mic and offer up a shopping list of software stocks to buy. I am not going to do that because: 1) I no longer pick stocks, and 2) I don't believe the bottom in software stocks is in.\n\nAnd this brings me to my guiding light for today's Morning Brief: contagion.\n\nThe reason I'm worried about this new phase of the software stock crash is that it looks to be spreading to other areas of the market. We witnessed that during Thursday's brutal session for stocks.\n\nAnd Wall Street is beginning to take notice.\n\n\"Regardless of arguable ubiquity of AI application legitimately widening shakedown, the wider selloff in commodities/gold have hallmarks of cross-liquidation involving financial contagion risks,\" Mizuho strategist Vishnu Varathan said. \"Nonetheless, there are increasingly legitimate worries — involving with 'contagion' and froth in bull markets — associated with this 'correlation creep', whereby AI-driven sell-off cascade more indiscriminately.\"\n\nVarathan makes a great point, and it could be where market sentiment heads next. Think of the next dark cloud emerging in the sky coming to sit on top of your house. As this dark cloud rolls in, markets will adjust further.\n\nTo be sure, only time will tell if the massive software stock sell-offs are overdone. But this much we can say: It's an exciting time to be in tech as billions get spent to build out America's AI infrastructure. You just have to respect this hardcore trend and remember it won't be great news for every publicly traded company.",

    "description": "Interim manager Martin O'Neill says the current side's fighting spirit reminds him of his previous Celtic glory years after their comeback win in Kilmarnock.",
    "fullText": "When your manager is a club legend and he starts comparing you to the side that made him such, you know you must be doing something right.\n\nIt might just be a clever bit of psychology to do so, but if it helps Martin O'Neill lead Celtic to another Scottish title, he will have worked his magic again.\n\nWhatever words he used at half-time at Rugby Park, they were certainly clever considering the reigning champions came from two goals down to secure a 3-2 victory deep into stoppage time.\n\nWatch: Kilmarnock v Celtic - Sportscene highlights\n\nIt was the third time in a week that Celtic had rescued victory from the jaws of a damaging result.\n\nLast weekend, they looked to be exiting the Scottish Cup before Junior Adamu equalised in the 90th minute and Sebastian Tounekti scored the winner in extra time to secure a quarter-final place.\n\nOn Wednesday, they were seconds away from dropping a league point at home to bottom side Livingston, only for latest signing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to produce a dream debut winner, again in the 90th minute.\n\nThis time, Kilmarnock looked destined for what would have been a deserved point until Julian Araujo smashed their resistance with a stunning strike seven minutes into overtime.\n\nFor some, it would have been a reminder of the \"relentless\" nature of Ange Postecoglu's title-winning Celtic side.\n\nFor O'Neill, it brought back memories of his own glory days. Of the famous names like Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton and John Hartson who contributed to three league titles, three Scottish Cups, a League Cup and a journey to the Uefa Cup final.\n\n\"I managed, coached, a really top-quality side here 20-odd years ago who had loads of spirit, loads of resilience, loads of ability,\" the 73-year-old Northern Irishman told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"And these lads here are emulating that in many aspects and sometimes surpassing.\"\n\nLate goals are certainly becoming a bit of a habit for his current charges since he returned for a second spell as interim manager following the dismal short spell under Wilfried Nancy.\n\nCeltic have now scored six winning goals in the 90th minute or later in the Premiership this season, the most by any team in a single campaign since it was rebranded in 2013, surpassing the previous best by Rangers in 2016-17.\n\nIndeed, until Araujo's winner in Ayrshire, the Old Firm sides were sitting on eight goals apiece in the 90th minute or later in the Premiership this season.\n\nThe two Glasgow sides have had their problems this season, both sacking managers, with Heart of Midlothian having taken advantage to lead the table since September.\n\nChermiti hat-trick earns Rangers seismic win over leaders Hearts\n\nCeltic score 97th-minute winner to down Kilmarnock\n\nFormidable Motherwell carve out victory over Aberdeen\n\nHowever, it is the kind of spirit that has been gradually pegging back Derek McInnes' pacesetters as the traditional giants of Scottish football start to get their act together.\n\n\"The spirit the players has been absolutely fantastic,\" McNeill said.\n\n\"It was a wonderful second-half performance for us. Kilmarnock adapted to the conditions, the rain, the pitch, much better than we did and sometimes you just have to dig in - and that's exactly what we did.\"\n\nCeltic's board has been under pressure this season for their recruitment, both on the field and off it, but their latest moves appear to be bearing fruit.\n\nAdamu, the striker who arrived on loan from Freiburg last month, saved their blushes against Dundee and Tounekti, the summer arrival from Hammarby, secured cup progress before his opener inspired the comeback against Kilmarnock.\n\nRight-back match winner Araujo was another January arrival on loan from Bournemouth, while former England midfielder Oxlade-Chamberlain grabbed the midweek winner days after being plucked from half a season without a club.\n\nOf course, O'Neill's introduction of Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tounekti and another January arrival, Czech Republic striker Tomas Cvancara, at half-time also proved to be a managerial masterstroke.\n\nDespite the plaudits, O'Neill recognises that flaws remain.\n\n\"I thought we were very poor in the first half,\" he said. \"As a team defending, we weren't that good then we keep giving the ball away at times, but the second half was totally different.\n\n\"We made the changes at half time and then Seb scores a wonder goal for us and puts us right back in the game, culminating in us winning the match.\n\n\"But you can't keep doing that. We've got to put in the full 90 minutes.\"\n\nThe win at Rugby Park had former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner harking back to yet another era.\n\n\"They know now that this game is not 90 minutes - it's now now 96-97 minutes and they will keep going to the final whistle,\" he said.\n\n\"And that's the making of a championship-winning team. We did it in '87-88 and we won games when we were almost out of it and that's what it takes.\n\n\"You keep going. You might not play brilliantly in all of the games.\"\n\nFormer Kilmarnock goalkeeper Cammy Bell suggested \"small margins are going Celtic's way\" right now.\n\n\"They do not stop and you see the reaction of the players, the fans and the togetherness and the players will be in there on top of the world because that is a huge result for Celtic.\"\n\nWith Rangers producing a comeback of their own to beat Hearts 4-2 in the later kick-off at Ibrox, only three points separate the top three title contenders, with third-top Celtic having a game in hand.\n\nHow many more stoppage-time winners will be crucial to the destiny of the silverware?\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Aston Villa manager Natalia Arroyo was disappointed by side's 7-3 defeat by Tottenham while opposite number Martin Ho wanted more goals.",
    "fullText": "If anything, Tottenham boss Martin Ho was a little disappointed by his side's 7-3 success at Aston Villa.\n\nHaving just watched his side comprehensively take apart the hosts for their second biggest Women's Super League win, he said: \"We probably could have had another five or six more.\"\n\nHo might well have been thinking they should have beaten their 8-0 record victory over Brighton back in October 2022.\n\nSpurs had 27 shots, 12 of them on target, in dismantling struggling Villa, who have now tasted defeat in four straight league games.\n\nVilla boss Natalia Arroyo admitted: \"They were ruthless and clinical in every action and didn't allow us to breathe for one second.\n\n\"It was like being thrown in a swimming pool and not allowed to get air - it was cruel. I am really sorry and disappointed.\"\n\nThe goal rush was started by Signe Gaupset's first Spurs goal on 10 minutes. Villa equalised but were only level for three minutes as Spurs grabbed two \n\nOriane Jean-Francois pulled another goal back for Villa in the 68th minute but just like in the first half, Tottenham responded quickly - just 12 seconds later - and three more followed to complete the rout.\n\n68 minutes 2-3: Oriane Jean-Francois scores for Villa.\n\n69 minutes 2-4: Cathinka Tandberg restores Tottenham's two-goal cushion.\n\n72 minutes 2-5: Maika Hamano stretches lead.\n\n80 minutes 3-5: Kirsty Hanson trims the deficit with her second of the afternoon.\n\n82 minutes 3-6: Substitute Tandberg scores her second goal with her third touch of the game.\n\n85 minutes 3-7: Julie Blakstad rounds off the 10-goal thriller at Villa Park.\n\nSpurs thrash Villa in 10-goal WSL thriller\n\nBefore becoming Tottenham manager in July last year, Ho was in charge of Norwegian side SK Brann.\n\nIn his first nine games, he got seven wins to help Brann finish fourth in the table.\n\nHe also created history in the Champions League, leading them to victory in all four of their qualifying matches to become the first Norwegian side to reach the group stage.\n\nHis Scandinavian connections are now bearing fruit at Spurs, with five from that region playing a part at Villa Park.\n\n\"We've been speaking about having more of a ruthless edge with the ball in front of goal because we are creating chances,\" said Ho afterwards.\n\n\"We had 27 shots - that's a lot. We probably could have had another five or six [goals] with the chances we created but when you score that many goals, it shows the belief in the team and the confidence through the group.\"\n\nNorway duo Blakstad and Gaupset each scored and provided an assist, while compatriot Tandberg came off the bench to score twice. Denmark winger Olivia Holdt also scored one and made one.\n\nThe 20-year-old Gaupset only joined Tottenham in January from Brann, while Blakstad, 24, signed from Hammarby four days later.\n\nAs for Tandberg, 21, and the 24-year-old Holdt, they came last summer and have also been instrumental in the side's efforts this season.\n\nTandberg is their top scorer in the league with six goals, and has two assists, and Holdt just one behind, but has provided three assists.\n\nThe exciting forward options has given fifth-placed Spurs hope of pushing for a Champions League place as they joined Arsenal on 29 points - five adrift of second-placed Manchester United, with Chelsea in third.\n\nEven if they miss out, there has been radical improvement under Ho.\n\nHaving finished second from bottom with 20 points last season, they are nine better off this time around with six games still left to play.\n\nAt the end of the 2022-23 season, Villa finished fifth on 37 points and there was talk of them going on to break into the top three.\n\nSince then, they have at least stabilised in mid-table, finishing seventh with 24 points and then sixth with 25 last term.\n\nCurrently however, Arroyo's side are ninth with 16 points from their 16 games - just seven above bottom club Leicester City, while fellow strugglers Liverpool and West Ham show signs of revival in the fight to stay up.\n\nVilla do have the league's second top scorer in Kirsty Hanson, whose nine goals are six fewer than Manchester City's Khadija Shaw.\n\nAt the back, however, things are starting to unravel, with 25 goals conceded in the past six league matches.\n\nThey have also shipped 12 in the final 15 minutes of the second half, more than any other team in the league this season.\n\nArroyo said: \"We don't want to lose a game, we don't want to concede seven goals and we need to do better.\n\n\"We will have a few weeks to work together and hopefully get fresh legs, more options and a deeper bench. I am proud of scoring three goals and will take some of the positives but we can't let teams score almost all of chances they have. See if we can close our house.\"\n\nVilla, who face leaders Manchester City next, need to arrest their slide to avoid getting sucked into the relegation battle.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "Former President Barack Obama spilled what he learned about extraterrestrial life when he was in the White House, saying aliens are \"real.\"",
    "fullText": "In his wide-ranging interview with progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen on Saturday, former President Barack Obama spilled what he learned about extraterrestrial life when he was in the White House.\n\n“I want to do a little bit of a lightning round, because it’s not often I’ll get access to a president of the United States,” Cohen said.\n\n“Come on, man,” Obama encouraged him.\n\n“So, couple questions here: Are aliens real?”\n\n“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in Area 51,” Obama said.\n\n“There’s no underground facility,” he continued, adding, “unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States.”\n\nCohen then asked, “What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president?”\n\n“Where are the aliens?” Obama said with a chuckle.\n\nObama didn’t let on exactly how he knew aliens were real, or whether it was just his own personal belief.\n\nThe subject of space aliens has gained traction in the years since Obama was president. Several congressional hearings have been held between 2022 and 2025 focusing on “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena“.\n\nIn 2023 NPR reported that during his testimony, Retired Maj. David Grusch — who went from being part of the Pentagon’s UAP Task Force to becoming a government whistleblower — told the House Oversight Committee’s national security subcommittee “that he had been denied access to some government UFO programs but that he knows the ‘exact locations’ of UAPs in U.S. possession.”\n\n“Grusch also alleged that the U.S. has retrieved ‘non-human’ biological matter from the pilots of the crafts,” the report said.\n\nAnd just last summer, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) told Joe Rogan that she has seen evidence of “interdimensional beings.”\n\nLuna serves as the head of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, a subcommittee under the House Oversight Committee. She told Rogan, “Based on the photos that I’ve seen, I’m very confident that there’s things out there that have not been created by mankind.”\n\nWatch the interview above with former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe post ‘They’re Real!’ Barack Obama Spills What He Learned About Aliens When He Was President first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Wales played in front of their smallest Six Nations crowd in Cardiff as the crisis in the domestic game continues to turn off fans.\n\nJust 57,744 turned out to watch the latest record defeat, this time a 54-12 hammering by France at the Principality Stadium.\n\nIt meant there were more than 15,000 empty seats for what is traditionally one of the biggest events in the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) calendar.\n\nBut the uncertainty within the game in Wales appears to be taking a toll on the public appetite.\n\nWales head coach Steve Tandy said: \"We understand it's our job as a team to get the support here but the public have been amazingly supportive and understand where we are.\"\n\nIt was lower than the previous worst attendance of 58,349 against Italy in 2002 when Wales were in another losing streak.\n\nThe cost of a match-day experience in Cardiff has been suggested as the reason for some fans staying away.\n\nBut the political turmoil in the domestic game, with the WRU looking to cut one region while facing a potential vote of no confidence among member clubs, is leaving disgruntled fans to turn away.\n\nBefore Sunday's game, fans told BBC Sport the current crisis was \"heartbreaking, sad and depressing\" and many were no longer motivated to buy tickets.\n\nSwansea council leader Rob Stewart, who has previously spoken out against the Welsh Rugby Union's plans to potentially cut Ospreys, said fans were voting with their feet.\n\nHe said on social media: \"It's heart-breaking to see the Principality Stadium barely 3/4 full today. Much as we love our Wales team, fans are voting with their feet and staying away.\n\n\"Their message to the WRU is clear - we will stay away until you go away.\"\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nWales still rugby nation despite struggles - Tandy\n\nTens of thousands of Six Nations tickets still unsold amid Welsh rugby turmoil\n\nFans and clubs have openly criticised the WRU hierarchy, with board member John Manders saying some of the social media comments aimed at the governing body's bosses has \"crossed a line\".\n\nWales are also on a desperately poor run of form having lost 23 or their last 25 Test matches.\n\nFormer Wales international James Hook told the Scrum V podcast: \"Fans want to see a competitive game with a chance of Wales winning but at the moment we're got getting that. No-one is coming expecting Wales to win and that's a worry.\"\n\nHowever Wales head coach Tandy believes the team still has the support of the nation.\n\n\"We love the connection with our communities and nation. Even with limited numbers, when they get behind the team at the end, it does inspire the players,\" he said after Sunday's game.\n\n\"I understand there is lots going on and has been in Wales for a really long time, but we want to unify everything.\n\n\"We're a small nation, we need everything to be flowing in the right direction. I genuinely believe everyone needs to play their part in how we get there. There needs to be some patience to get change. It doesn't happen overnight. \"",

My relationship with my body. My health. My family. My self-worth.\n\n\"Would I do it all again?

    "description": "Does 183 team changes in 14 ties devalue the FA Cup? Chief football writer Phil McNulty insists the cup retains its old magic.",
    "fullText": "The changing face of the FA Cup was graphically illustrated by the vast total of 183 team changes in the 14 fourth-round ties played over the weekend.\n\nMass alterations started as the preserve of Premier League clubs manipulating squads when priorities started to lie elsewhere, but they have now been joined by their lower-league counterparts.\n\nHull City made 10 changes for the 4-0 loss at home to Chelsea, while Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna made the same number for their defeat at Championship rivals Wrexham.\n\nThey are both in the Championship play-off places while Oxford United, fighting to stay in the division, made eight for their narrow home defeat to Premier League Sunderland.\n\nBlack Cats head coach Regis le Bris made six changes, but was vindicated as he can now contemplate a fifth-round tie.\n\nThe total works out at an average of a little more than 13 changes for each tie, so is the glamour and the much-cherished magic of the FA Cup being diluted by the lack of full-strength teams?\n\nOr does it actually even matter?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nBrilliant Mansfield pile pressure on Parker - is his time up at Burnley?\n\nTry asking Mansfield Town supporters if the FA Cup is a devalued commodity, after the side sitting 13th in League one took 3,500 supporters to Turf Moor and beat top-flight Burnley 2-1, despite manager Nigel Clough making six changes.\n\nTry asking the Burnley fans who reacted furiously at the final whistle whether it matters. Their pain was clear, the anger voluble.\n\nClarets manager Scott Parker, with Premier League survival as his target, made nine changes from a dramatic victory at Crystal Palace, only to see the decision backfire.\n\nParker may be able to play down the result should Burnley stay up, but it still represents another serious blot on his copybook. And will be remembered if they are relegated.\n\nThe FA Cup still retains its unique pulling power, whoever is on the teamsheet.\n\nA full house watched West Ham only scrape past League One strugglers Burton Albion after extra time, while Leeds United's victory on penalties over Birmingham City at St. Andrew's carried a real throwback feel to it.\n\nOne head coach who has clearly learned not to play fast and loose with the FA Cup is Liverpool's Arne Slot, who made a relatively conservative four changes from their win at Sunderland for a 3-0 fourth-round win against Brighton at Anfield.\n\nSlot was memorably stung at the same stage last season when he made 10 alterations for a tricky tie at then Championship side Plymouth Argyle.\n\nHe compounded his error by leaving the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah at home, Liverpool's shadow team losing 1-0 in a memorably raucous atmosphere at Home Park.\n\nIt was the object lesson that the FA Cup is not to be messed with, as it can still produce the moments that can make memories for a lifetime.\n\nThe most magical of all may yet await when sixth-tier Macclesfield face Brentford, seventh in the Premier League, on Monday as they try to repeat their sensational third-round win at home to Crystal Palace.\n\nThe atmosphere at Moss Rose will be red hot once more. This will be the archetypal FA Cup occasion. Brentford will have been warned by Crystal Palace's downfall, so their teamsheet will be of interest.\n\nIt has become a delicate, hazardous balancing act as the FA Cup represents a genuine chance for those clubs who have no hope of challenging for the Premier League – or success elsewhere.\n\nThere are many factors managers and clubs throughout the pyramid must weigh up, often involving serious financial consequences, which has unquestionably placed what is still regarded by many as the greatest cup competition in the world down their pecking order.\n\nThe FA Cup, come what may, will always retain a special place in the hearts and minds of the public, irrespective of how many team changes are made.\n\nThe pressure of games and preservation of players under physical strain also play into the thoughts of managers, with consequences for the cup.\n\nIt has not stopped the Premier League's heavyweights making their way into the last 16, with Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle United all now sensing that increased anticipation of a Wembley appearance.\n\nAnd as the FA Cup comes closer to the sharp end, it will be intriguing to measure the number of changes compared to earlier rounds.\n\nThis is a different competition from days gone by, but it still retains much of its old allure and results like Macclesfield's against Palace and Mansfield's unseating of Burnley will remain part of its glorious narrative.\n\nAnd that will never change, no matter the names on a teamsheet or those out on the pitch.\n\nEvery player, and every supporter, will still have that dream of an appearance in the FA Cup final at Wembley in their thoughts.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Team GB's men's curlers suffered their second defeat of the Winter Olympics but remain on course for a semi-final place, after they followed a victory over Germany with a nerve-shredding extra-end loss to Switzerland on Sunday.\n\nBruce Mouat's rink were edged out 6-5 by the Swiss in a high-grade repeat of last year's World Championship final, after a fuss-free 9-4 dismantling of the Germans earlier in the day.\n\nThe world champions have won four of their opening six matches, with another couple needed to guarantee a place in the last four and a shot at the medals high in the Dolomites in northern Italy.\n\n\"It was a great game,\" vice-skip Grant Hardie told BBC Sport. \"It could have gone either way but they took their chance in the end.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nThe Scottish quartet were in command throughout against the Germans, leading 5-2 at the break before accelerating clear, but the hitherto unbeaten Swiss proved more obdurate opposition.\n\nMouat's men led 3-2 at the break - a steal in the third proved the difference - and it took until the seventh end for either side to register a score greater than one.\n\nIt was the Swiss who did it, to lead 4-3, but it all came down to the last end.\n\nBritain needed one to tie, two to win. They had to settle for the former, meaning an extra end. But Switzerland had the hammer and they held their nerve to close out a statement victory.\n\n\"On another day we come away with the win,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's going to be tough to beat them but we know we are playing pretty well and it would be exciting to play them again.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Britain's women were unable to repeat their statement win over Canada against the Swedish rink who denied them European gold in November.\n\nThe unbeaten Swedes raced out to a 7-3 lead at the break - after twice scoring three with the hammer - and stole one in the sixth to take a stranglehold on the game.\n\nRebecca Morrison's rink kept fighting but ultimately fell to a 10-7 defeat to leave their semi-final hopes in the balance.\n\nAt least four wins will be required from their final five round-robin matches to have any hope of reaching the knockouts.\n\n\"It's really hard at this level - it's near-misses and we're a couple of centimetres away from making great shots,\" Morrison told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's frustrating but that's what happens at the Olympics. You need to be at your best and we just weren't quite there.\"\n\nThe women are back on the ice against Denmark (08:05 GMT) and Switzerland (18:05) on Monday, while the men face Norway (13:05).\n\nAnastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby safely progressed to the final round of the pairs figure skating after recording a season-best score.\n\nThe duo, who are the first British representatives in this Olympic event since 2014, endured a troubled build-up to the Games after Digby suffered a wrist injury which limited their ability to practice lifts.\n\nAnd in the team event at the start of the Games, Vaipan-Law suffered a fall during their throw triple Salchow, meaning there were worries about whether they would finish in the top 16 of the short program – needed to qualify for the free skate.\n\nBut they assuaged those doubts with a slick routine as Vaipan-Law landed the throw well before their final spin was synchronised perfectly.\n\nDigby was grinning even before their routine concluded, and was proven right as they scored 66.07, their highest score of the 2025-26 season.\n\n\"That little celebration at the end was me releasing all the emotion of it going exactly as I wanted it to,\" Vaipan-Law told the BBC.\n\nThey qualify in 13th place, meaning they will perform fourth in the free skate tomorrow – and will aim to better their best World Championship finish of 12th.\n\n\"Seeing so many British flags, that energy gave us a little extra,\" said Digby. \"We kept our heads and we were nice and calm. A clean skate, we couldn't ask for any more at the Olympics.\"\n\nGermany's Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin, who last year won world silver, lead at the half-way point with a score of 80.01.\n\nEuropean champions Anastasia Metelkina and Luka Berulava are second as they aim to win a first-ever Winter Olympic medal for Georgia, while Canada's Lia Pereira and Trennt Michaud are currently in bronze position.\n\nAdele Nicoll made history by becoming the first British woman to compete in the monobob at the Olympics and sits 13th at the halfway point at the Cortina sliding track.\n\nThe 29-year-old clocked a time of 2:00:83 over the two heats, 1.71 seconds off Germany's Laura Nolte in top spot.\n\nIt is unlikely Nicoll will trouble the medals but a top-10 finish would likely represent a successful Games for the Welsh slider, who was a travelling reserve for the Beijing 2022 Games but will also contest the two-woman event at Milan-Cortina.\n\n\"I was more nervous than maybe I'd realised for the first run and I felt a little bit like jelly on the block,\" she said.\n\n\"Seeing the Milan-Cortina Olympic rings was really surreal and emotional. These were all first experiences, I just wanted to do myself proud.\"\n\nNicoll is also a three-time British shot put champion and is targeting an appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Mica Moore, who represented Team GB four years ago but has since opted to compete for Jamaica, sits 15th on 2:00:98 before Monday's medal-deciding heats.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

One hundred and two years, to be exact.\n\nBut for those in the know, it has been just a matter of time.\n\nIn winning the mixed team snowboard cross title in Livigno on Sunday, Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale have written themselves into the history books, forever to be known as the first - yet it has been a very real prospect for a while.\n\nIn 2018, GB Snowsport set the lofty ambition of Great Britain becoming a top five snow sport nation by 2030.\n\nIt was a target set to build on the success of snowboarder Jenny Jones, Team GB's first medallist on snow with her 2014 bronze, and the same colour won by freestyle skier Izzy Atkin and snowboarder Billy Morgan four years later.\n\nBut it was also a target that raised eyebrows and smirks, and perhaps with four years to go, may still be a touch too ambitious - but the trajectory of progression is undeniable.\n\nIn Bankes - both individually and with Nightingale - Mia Brookes and Zoe Atkin, GB has world champions on snow. It has overall multiple Crystal Globe winners, X Games and World Cup gold medallists too.\n\n\"We've been saying we've got the talent, we've been showing the talent in World Championships and World Cups, but everybody looks to the Olympics because everything is amplified,\" GB Snowsport chief executive Vicky Gosling told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Here we are, actually producing that gold. For us, that is massive.\n\n\"We've said that anything is possible. We have amazing Brits with grit and amazing talent, it's all about unlocking that.\n\n\"People can truly see it's possible and we can deliver Olympic medals.\n\n\"Hopefully we are inspiring the next generation to get themselves to snow domes and get themselves prepared because the future is looking rosy.\"\n\nSpeaking after Sunday's gold, Nightingale said: \"What we've shown today, we are becoming a top snow sports nation and that's great for kids to see.\n\n\"We inspire kids to go on the slopes and go snowboarding or skiing or whatever it is, just try out winter sports.\n\n\"As a nation, if we get young kids into it, we can do very well.\"\n\nGB's Bankes & Nightingale win historic snowboard gold\n\nYes, it's right to say that the Milan-Cortina Games has not gone to plan for some British snow athletes so far.\n\nBut Olympic medal tables do not tell the full story, and are not the be-all and end-all.\n\nSnowboarder Brookes finished an agonising fourth in the big air - despite almost landing a never-before-seen trick in competition - and failed to qualify for the slopestyle final.\n\nYet despite not winning Olympic gold, silver or bronze as anticipated after her previous World Championship title and double X Games gold, she is a diamond on the British books and one of the biggest names in her sport.\n\nShe is just 19 and could well lead the British challenge at multiple Winter Olympics in the future - if she decides to continue down that avenue.\n\nThat's because Brookes is a snowboarder's snowboarder, a \"purist's dream\", who takes far more joy in shredding on a powder day than competing on the world stage.\n\nSo highly respected is she in her sport that every brand wants to work with her - BBC Sport understands it is just a case of name your price.\n\nNext year, her own line of Oakley goggles will hit the market. She already has her own Mia Brookes CAPiTA snowboard, and a boots line with Vans.\n\nIn Muir and Atkin, Great Britain also has two of the world's best freestyle skiers.\n\nLike Brookes, Muir missed out on an Olympic medal by the narrowest of margins, just 0.41 points separating her from bronze in the slopestyle, but she has another chance in the big air on Monday after qualifying fourth - with plenty still in her locker.\n\nAtkin, meanwhile, is the current halfpipe world champion and X Games gold medallist, and will get her campaign under way on 21 February.\n\nAway from the flagship park and pipe squad, Andrew Musgrave - competing at his fifth Olympics - finished sixth in the 10km interval start freestyle to post Britain's best finish in a Winter Olympic cross-country skiing event.\n\nThe Alpine skiing squad - Dave Ryding, Laurie Taylor and Billy Major - compete on Monday in the slalom.\n\nIn 2022, Ryding won Britain's first World Cup gold in the sport and will retire at the end of the season with seven podiums under his belt, while Taylor achieved a career-best fourth earlier in the season.\n\nWhat makes GB's snow athletes' achievements all the more remarkable is the limited budget on which the team operates.\n\nAs Gosling told BBC Sport before the Games got under way, \"we've punched way above our weight in terms of the deliverables\".\n\nUK Sport ploughed £7.2m into the ski and snowboard Olympic programme over the Milan-Cortina four-year cycle, more than any other winter sport but a mere fraction of the budget on what other nations are running.\n\nIt equates to £1.8m per year, a limited amount given the amount of global travel required for not just the athletes, but their coaches and support staff too, and so the governing body - which has just seven full-time members of staff at its London headquarters - has had to turn its hand to sourcing alternative funding through commercial revenue and sponsorship deals.\n\nThe sticking point for any GB success on snow has always been the lack of snowy mountains and freestyle courses, but that is not as convincing an argument as it once was.\n\nYes, many of Team GB's athletes have honed their crafts overseas - Bankes is Hemel Hempstead-born but grew up in the French Alps, while Nightingale hails from Bolton but moved to Austria with his parents.\n\nBut Jones and Morgan both learned on dry slopes in the UK. Looking at the current crop, Brookes grew up riding the rails at the indoor ski centre in Manchester, while Muir learned her craft in Aberdeen. Ryding raced on plastic in Lancashire until he was 21.\n\n\"We have over 60 facilities in the UK,\" said Gosling. \"We produce amazing talent and we have showed it time and time again over the past few years.\n\n\"Now it's about nurturing the talent and building the pathways needed and [putting] more emphasis and funding into it.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "SEATTLE - After periods of extended near-record warm temperatures and sunshine streaks in the Seattle area, there are some increased chances of snow heading into the workweek as more precipitation moves in and freezing temperatures stick around each weekday morning.\n\nFor President’s Day morning, the FOX 13 weather team forecasts a spotty rain-snow mix in the lowlands of western Washington. The chance for lower elevation snowflakes tomorrow is low for several reasons — including the fact that moisture won't arrive until after temperatures have risen a few degrees above freezing. The early part of the morning will probably be dry.\n\nOnce the rain arrives, if it falls heavily enough, it could locally cool the atmosphere to drag down snow levels to the surface. Even then, showers don't look very impressive. Accumulations are unlikely. If anything were to briefly stick early on, it would be isolated and mainly confined to patio furniture and grassy surfaces — and even that is a stretch. \n\nBottom line: this is not looking like a big deal. The early drive will be dry. By 9–11 a.m., wet roads could slow you down. Any wet snowflakes will transition over to plain rain into the afternoon, with highs on Monday in the mid-40s.\n\nArea ski resorts will see minor accumulations to its snowpack amid a challenging lack of snowfall for this winter season.\n\nFor the Cascade region, reports indicate there could be up to two feet of snow for the upcoming week, including at Washington ski resorts in need of snow this year.\n\nSnow levels will lower from around 3000' on Sunday all the way down to as low as 500' later in the week.  Some much-needed snow returns to the mountains Monday with additional chances during the week.\n\nAfter a dry Sunday, our weather will quickly become cool and showery during the week with chances of wet snowflakes mixed in each day.  Overnight lows will be frosty, near freezing every morning.\n\nHeading into February, the snow pack in Washington was only at about 40% of its average, with chances to make that up by the end of the season quickly dropping.\n\nCity of Seattle settles lawsuit over death of Jaahnavi Kandula\n\nSome gift cards sold at Costco are now worthless\n\nSeahawks Super Bowl parade: Video, highlights, more from downtown Seattle\n\nSemi full of candy crashes on Highway 18 in Covington\n\nCrowds climb, damage Seattle's historic pergola after Seahawks Super Bowl win\n\nTo get the best local news, weather and sports in Seattle for free, \n\nDownload the free FOX LOCAL app for mobile in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for live Seattle news, top stories, weather updates and more local and national news.",

    "fullText": "Bill Maher eviscerated President Donald Trump over the “biggest dick move in American history,” following the rolling back of climate change regulations.\n\nOn the Friday, February 13 episode of Real Time With Bill Maher, the late-night host, 70, took aim at the POTUS, 79, over his remarks — and recent actions — involving global warming.\n\n“Trump has always said it’s a hoax, the whole thing with climate change,” Maher explained. “He said, scientists, he says, are ‘stupid people.’ He says, the idea that greenhouse gases cause climate change, there’s no basis in fact.”\n\nThat’s when the stand-up comedian pointed out, “He thinks it’s just some bulls*** that people made up out of nothing to get rich. You know, like crypto.”\n\nOn February 12, the Trump administration rescinded a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declaration stating that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a danger to public health. The Associated Press reported that the repeal eliminates all greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and could result in a larger repeal of climate regulations on things like power plants and oil and gas facilities.\n\nOf the move, Maher said, “And, yes, his EPA director, Lee Zeldin, said this is the single, this is a quote, ‘single largest deregulatory action in American history.'”\n\nHe then bluntly declared, “Probably true. Also the biggest dick move in American history.”\n\nIn September 2025, Trump slammed the concept of climate change during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” the POTUS said, per PBS. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nReal Time With Bill Maher, Fridays at 10/9c, HBO\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — A 15th-century statue that once stood outside Milan’s iconic Duomo has found a new home.\n\nThe Bearded Saint with Book was recently restored under the “Adopt a Statue” program, launched in 2020 by the centuries-old institution that oversees the cathedral’s conservation. As of Feb. 13, it is on display at Piazzale Cadorna, behind a glass window at the headquarters of FNM, a Lombardy-based transport company.\n\nThe program recruits donors — either companies or individuals — to fund restoration of a statue under a loan agreement that allows it to occasionally be displayed outside the Duomo.\n\n“The uniqueness of this project is that statues that would otherwise remain in our deposits are restored and brought back to their original beauty,” the program’s project manager, Elisa Mantia, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “In that way, they can continue to tell the story of the Duomo even in places that are far from the monument.”\n\nThese agreements are in some cases granted for an initial one-year term and may be renewed. The initiative follows previous fundraising campaigns in which donors could adopt gargoyles or spires in exchange for inclusion in the Duomo’s donor register, where contributors’ names are recorded as part of the cathedral’s long history of support.\n\nThe construction of the Duomo began in 1386, under the rule of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, then lord of Milan, in collaboration with the city’s archbishop. The cathedral was built on the site of two preexisting basilicas and its completion took more than five centuries. One of its bronze doors was not installed until 1965.\n\nBecause construction spanned centuries, the Duomo’s statues were carved by artists from different regions and periods, resulting in a monument that reads as a timeline of evolving artistic styles.\n\nThe Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, which oversees the cathedral’s conservation, has sought funding to restore statues removed over the centuries for maintenance or safety reasons.\n\n“Culture can save the world,” Andrea Gibelli, president of FNM, said during a press conference on Feb. 13 to mark the unveiling of Bearded Saint with Book. “We want to spread the cultural riches we are fortunate to have, which are often overlooked or not fully appreciated.\"\n\nOther sculptures adopted under the program by different sponsors have included a 16th-century David, a depiction of Samson and the Lion, and a statue of Saint Matthew the Apostle.\n\nWhile the number of adopted statues isn't disclosed and not all are displayed in public spaces, Mantia said that her institution has preselected around 30 sculptures as eligible for restoration. Each case must be authorized by Italy’s cultural heritage authorities, as the process involves a formal loan agreement subject to conservation, insurance and transport regulations.\n\n“We usually select them because they are very beautiful and not so damaged that they would be unsafe to loan,” Mantia said.\n\nOnce a donor reaches out, experts like Mantia accompany them to the Duomo’s storage facilities to choose a sculpture. After it is selected, restoration typically takes between one and three months.\n\nBearded Saint with a Book was originally displayed outdoors. Aside from a black crust from air pollution on its surface, it had no structural damages preventing its loan.\n\n“This often involves only surface finishing or an intervention with compresses or mechanical cleaning,” Mantia said.\n\nThe marble used for both the statues and the Duomo itself comes from the quarries of Candoglia in Italy’s Piedmont region. The same stone has been used since the late 14th century, under the supervision of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo.\n\n“Beyond being the symbol of Milan, the Duomo is also a symbol of its history,” Mantia said. “It is a monument that grew together with the city, that tells within itself, in its statues and in the style with which it is decorated, the entire history of the city.”",

    "description": "An ex-Amazon manager says his layoff in October 2025 was a shock, but he's using this time to build AI skills, focus on his health, and apply to jobs.",
    "fullText": "Hemant Virmani was laid off from Amazon during the October 2025 round of layoffs.\n\nHe's using this time to learn new AI skills while applying to engineering roles — and exercising.\n\nHis teenage daughter has inspired him to stay positive, keep his cool, and focus on the future.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hemant Virmani, a 47-year-old tech professional based in Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAmazon was part of my daily life for 11.5 years, and suddenly it was gone.\n\nThere's no right way or easy way to do layoffs. I watched my team members get laid off in 2023, and I know how difficult it is. Still, when I received an email in the middle of the night in October 2025 saying I'd been laid off from my senior software development manager position, I was shocked.\n\nWatching my teenage daughter navigate her own difficult situation taught me the biggest lesson in how to move forward well. Now I'm applying to jobs and working on upskilling in AI so I can be proactive, not reactive, to the tech industry.\n\nOnly time will tell if this layoff is a blessing in disguise, but for now, it has led to a refreshing change.\n\nI loved my time at Amazon, and I really feel as though it's a place for exceptional people. The number of quality brains in the office, throwing around ideas and solving a custom problem, was amazing.\n\nThe morning after my layoff, I had a mandated 30-minute meeting with my manager, and it actually went very well. We talked about the layoff, and he offered me support. He delivered it all to me in a very positive, human way, and it was really affirming.\n\nAn old manager also reached out to meet me at a local coffee shop the next day to spend time together and check in on my state of mind. I think he wanted to go about the layoffs right, which isn't easy to do.\n\nI felt attached to the layoff for the first few days; however, I knew there was no way to control what happened — I could only control how I reacted to it.\n\nMy daughter is a senior in high school, and she had an adverse situation happen to her last year that required recovery. How she reacted in that difficult time inspired me. Her mental model was: \"Challenges don't have to keep me from showing up for myself or for others.\" Her positive attitude was inspiration for me to do the same.\n\nI kind of learned from her that I had to take this layoff with positivity, keep my cool, and focus on what was next.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I lost my father and spent the next month in India supporting my family. I took about a month to settle my mind, reflect on what I wanted next for my career, and help my daughter finish her college essays.\n\nIt's been a very refreshing change to think about what I want next in my engineering career. I'm less focused on the size or name of the next company I work for, and more on what I'd be doing there. I'm looking forward to hopefully heading the engineering for something that has a great impact on customers. Right now, I don't think that can be done without AI, so I'm working on upskilling.\n\nI want to be proactive, not reactive, about the AI skills I'll need in the future. My team at Amazon used some AI tools, so I'm familiar with some, but I was only able to spend a fraction of my workday using them. Now, I'm building those skills myself.\n\nI started working on a hobby AI project a couple of weeks ago, to go hands-on with AI and be more grounded in the reality of what the AI landscape is like right now. It's been different, and a refreshing change, to build something myself rather than to study it, read about it, or work on a team developing it.\n\nWhen I had a job, it was easy for my first priority to be work. Now I'm making sure that my top priority is my health. I've been going to the gym four or five days a week, and I'm refining a health plan to follow even after I start working again.\n\nOnce I'm done at the gym, my time is a 50/50 split between learning AI and applying to jobs or networking. I'm applying for head of engineering roles where I'd own significant impactful initiatives, averaging 2-3 applications every week.\n\nI made a post on LinkedIn about my layoff, and I received so many supportive comments, texts, and calls from people — some I hadn't talked to in decades. Someone from college whom I hadn't talked to in over 25 years reached out, and it was so nice. It felt like we never disconnected. I've also had multiple job leads come from my post, which I'm following up on.\n\nAs of now, I have some worries about when I'll find my next job, but this time has given me the ability to work on things I wasn't able to before. I'm making sure I spend this time with a lot of positivity, not letting negative thoughts come around.\n\nMy advice to anyone undergoing layoffs is to realize that layoffs are not about you. It's about an environment that is driving layoffs. Secondly, now that this has happened, you can't go back in the past and change it. Look forward to what you can do next. How you react is very important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from Amazon? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "After a weekend of FA Cup action without VAR, BBC Sport ask managers, fans and pundits whether the game needs technology - and what needs to change.",
    "fullText": "Would football be better without the video assistant referee (VAR) system?\n\nPremier League fans, managers and players got a reminder of what life was like without VAR in the FA Cup fourth round - and it is fair to say this weekend was not without its problems.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, VAR has not been brought in until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nAfter a season full of controversy, delayed decisions and confusion fuelled by VAR, its very existence has been questioned at times, with many claiming the game would be better without it.\n\nIn fact, after a day full of long delays, mixed messages and irate managers in early February, ex-Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Match of the Day: \"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\"\n\nAfter a couple of offside goals being allowed, a blatant penalty not being awarded plus various other controversial decisions, the weekend certainly brought the subject back into the public eye.\n\nLong delays, irate managers and mixed messages - is VAR bad for game?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nWe have all heard the arguments against VAR.\n\nDecisions taking too long, celebrations being put on hold while deliberations take place, confusion as goals are given - or ruled out - for marginal reasons, denying referees the ability to use their own common sense.\n\nBut Newcastle's controversial 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday could hardly have gone better for supporters of VAR - or worse for those who argue football is better without it.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener was clearly offside, Villa's full-back Lucas Digne inexplicably escaped conceding a penalty for handball and the Frenchman could easily have been dismissed for a reckless challenge as well.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold, especially us today when we were on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery went further, saying \"VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees\".\n\nThere was also some controversy at Anfield during Liverpool's 3-0 win over Brighton.\n\nSubstitute Rio Ngumoha, 17, had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside for the hosts, while the Seagulls were furious Mohamed Salah was awarded a penalty.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"In general, I enjoy watching football without VAR because if you then score you're like 'it's a goal'.\n\n\"I like VAR only for the clear and obvious things - I'm not meaning a red card yes or no for Marc Guehi on Mo Salah because I thought it was.\n\n\"So let's stay away from that and only go to offside yes or no, ball over the line yes or no and, for the rest, the referee referees the game.\n\n\"I think we're now so used to VAR that I would prefer to have VAR during a game.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola was unsure whether football was better with VAR, despite seeing Omar Marmoush denied a goal for a debatable offside in his side's 3-0 win against Salford.\n\n\"Sometimes before I thought it was better and sometimes I think VAR helps us to have a more fair game,\" he said. \"To be honest I don't know.\"\n\nFor some though, it is simple - rather than VAR being a solution for wrong decisions, they would argue officials just need to get things right.\n\nWhen asked on Match of the Day Live whether the errors at Villa Park put him in favour of VAR, ex-Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, said: \"No. I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it?\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think Saturday is a great example of that.\n\n\"These guys look petrified to make a decision because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\n\n\"For me, [referees' decisions] are actually getting worse.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given added on Match of the Day: \"It shows you why we use VAR. A lot of decisions the officials got wrong at Villa Park. VAR is like a comfort blanket for referees.\n\n\"The decision is taken away from the officials. The linesman has been told all season not to put their flag up, so their brain has been trained. I think it shows VAR is a help even though we complain about it most weeks.\"\n\nWhen asked whether football had become too reliant on VAR, Howe had some sympathy with the argument.\n\n\"There is an argument to say yes,\" he said. \"Because when VAR is there, there is a tendency to think 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'.\n\n\"Then your decision making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there. I would probably say you are right in that respect.\"\n\nBut former referee Graham Scott feels it is unfair to claim officials hide behind VAR.\n\n\"I really don't think that's fair,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"Obviously I work with them closely and I know these guys and they're not like that. It's not how their minds work, not how their processes work.\n\n\"I spent half my career with VAR and half without it - the other way around of course, without it first.\n\n\"And then when I was in the Premier League I was still dropping into the Championship quite often. So you're in and out, in and out. And your processes essentially stay the same.\n\n\"What has changed though is with VAR you don't have that spell in a game where you know you've made a really big error and you now have to reset and go again.\"\n\nJames: Football without VAR is real football. Having gone to games for the last 30 years, the last few years have been terrible in comparison. I don't bother cheering goals any more as the officials are far more interested in finding ways of disallowing goals than the entertainment of the match-going fan.\n\nVAR will be the thing that makes me turn in my season ticket, and if West Ham do get relegated the lack of VAR will be a blessing.\n\nFrank: I supported the introduction of VAR, but it was great not having it today. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many VAR ridiculous errors.\n\nAlan: Much, much better [without]. VAR has ruined the game, thankfully I now support non-league football where there are humans, making human mistakes and getting it right.\n\nStephen: Much better without VAR. No waiting for obvious incidents that everyone can see immediately but takes VAR forever to decide. Time for return of refs and linesman to start refereeing the game again.\n\nMike: Better, even though City probably had a goal chalked off incorrectly. Right or wrong, its so much better to just know immediately if its a goal or not. VAR is a moment-killer.\n\nLes: The game is so much better without VAR. It flows without problem like it used to do. The officials are there to make decisions rightly or wrongly. VAR are always making wrong calls so I can't see the point of it. Offside because someone's toes are on the lines drawn is absolutely pathetic.\n\nBonnie: As a Villa and VAR fan, that is exactly the decision that VAR doesn't get credit for. VAR gets it right 100%\n\nRoger: That was so blatantly offside, have linesman lost their natural ability to spot stuff like this since the introduction of VAR? Whenever you see a defence hold their line like Newcastle did, strikers are more often than not offside. Poor decision.\n\nPeter: There's an easy fix for VAR offsides. If you can watch one TV replay and see the on-field decision is clearly wrong, you intervene.\n\nStephen: That's what you all wanted isn't it? More goals regardless of whether they're actually fair or not?\n\nLiga: It's these types of situations and these types of situation only where VAR should and needs to be used for offsides. Not those hairline millimetre is he on or off line drawing nonsense situations.\n\nCallum: This season is proving 2 things. 1) VAR is a must. 2) Brave, high pressure attacking football is dead.\n\nBen: What are linesman for exactly? Having no VAR is a another shambles, who makes these decisions?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "A Chicago teen who spoke out for her father’s release after he was detained last fall by immigration officials in a deportation case has died after battling a rare form of cancer.\n\nOfelia Giselle Torres Hidalgo, 16, died Friday from stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the family said in a statement. Funeral arrangements are private.\n\nThe teenager was diagnosed in December 2024 with the aggressive form of soft tissue cancer and had been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment.\n\nAn immigration judge in Chicago ruled three days before Ofelia’s death that her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was conditionally entitled to receive “cancellation of removal” due to the hardships his deportation would cause his children who were born in the United States and are US citizens, according to the statement sent by an attorney representing Torres Maldonado.\n\nThe ruling provides Torres Maldonado with a path to becoming a lawful permanent resident and eventual US citizenship, the statement said.\n\nOfelia was present via Zoom at last week’s hearing.\n\n“Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threatened deportation of her father,” said Kalman Resnick, Torres Maldonado’s attorney. “We mourn Ofelia’s passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what’s right to our last breaths.”\n\nTorres Maldonado, a painter and home renovator, was detained October 18 at a Home Depot store in suburban Chicago as the area was at the center of a major immigration crackdown dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” which began in early September.\n\nOfelia was undergoing treatment when she appeared in October in a video posted on a GoFundMe page set up for the family.\n\n“My dad, like many other fathers, is a hard-working person who wakes up early in the morning and goes to work without complaining, thinking about his family,” she said in the video. “I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted just because they were not born here.”\n\nIn a wheelchair, she attended a hearing for her father in October. The family’s attorneys told a judge at that time that she was released from the hospital just a day before her father’s arrest so she could see family and friends. They added Ofelia had been unable to continue treatment “because of the stress and disruption.”\n\nTorres Maldonado’s attorneys petitioned for his release as his deportation case went through the system. A judge ordered a bond hearing after ruling in October his detention was illegal and violated Torres Maldonado’s due process rights.\n\nA judge later cited Torres Maldonado’s lack of criminal history while allowing his release on a $2,000 bond.\n\nLawyers said Torres Maldonado entered the US in 2003. He and his partner, Sandibell Hidalgo, also have a younger son.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security had alleged he had been living illegally in the US for years and has a history of driving offenses, including driving without a valid license, without insurance and speeding.",

    "description": "Premier League Wolves edge League Two Grimsby in an \"old school cup tie\" which provided an FA Cup \"throwback\".",
    "fullText": "It was, undeniably, an \"old school cup tie\" - one which both managers agreed provided \"a bit of a throwback\".\n\nThe pitch at Blundell Park was already a quagmire before kick-off between League Two Grimsby Town and Premier League Wolves, and rapidly deteriorated under relentless rainfall on the east coast.\n\nThe ball travelled unpredictably across the sodden surface. Players continued to slide for longer than expected. The pitch markings blurred in the mudbath.\n\nIt would be an understatement to suggest the conditions did not aid either team's ambitions of playing attractive football.\n\nBut they did produce fascinating scenes reminiscent of a bygone era, encapsulating the essence and charm of the FA Cup's history.\n\nThere would be no giant-killing here, however. Despite Grimsby's best efforts to test the visitors' resolve, top-flight strugglers Wolves squeezed into the fifth round by scoring from their only shot on target.\n\n\"It was a proper traditional old school cup tie,\" Grimsby boss David Artell told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It was going to be a fine margins game and that's how it was - we limited a Premier League team to one attempt on target and it's gone in.\n\n\"One chance, one goal for them. It showed how well we played in terrible conditions.\n\n\"The conditions made the game in some respects because it was a bit of a throwback.\"\n\nWolves edge past Grimsby on mudbath to reach fifth round\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards will take great encouragement from the gritty nature of his side's victory as they put their league struggles aside to reach the competition's last 16.\n\nThe 43-year-old reiterated to his players the importance of approaching their trip to face fourth-tier opposition with the right mentality, but his words could scarcely have prepared them for the messy reality on the ground.\n\nIndeed, for some of the Wolves players, this was a brutal introduction to the sort of tie which the FA Cup is famed.\n\n\"It was cold, wet, muddy and difficult conditions, but the lads did really well,\" Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It's mad, I quite enjoy these conditions. But there are not many lads in the dressing room who have seen the lower leagues in England.\n\n\"We go out every game to try and win. Our league form has not been great but a cup run would be unbelievable for us and the fans. Hopefully we can keep going and see where it takes us.\"\n\nWhile Wolves have managed just one win after 26 games in their dismal Premier League campaign, back-to-back FA Cup wins against League Two opponents has extended their cup interest into March.\n\nEdwards will hope the competition can yet provide some joy to supporters with relegation to the Championship seemingly inevitable - however the victories come.\n\n\"It was an aggressive game of headers and volleys,\" joked Edwards, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"They were really difficult conditions for both teams. It was a different type of game and a bit of a throwback.\n\n\"It was an eye-opener for a lot of the players when we arrived, the wind was sideways and there were puddles on the pitch.\n\n\"It was never going to be a day for beautiful football. We played with realism, we showed spirit and fight. We did the basics well and came through.\"\n\nEdwards added: \"It was all set up for a cup upset. We talked a lot about mentality over the past few days and the players showed a real desire to win.\"\n\nEdwards' players will have to adapt to a very different challenge on Wednesday, when they trade the Blundell Park mud for hosting Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\nFor Grimsby boss Artell, a \"bowling green\" surface much closer in quality to the one his side stunned Manchester United on in the League Cup earlier this season would also have been preferable.\n\nThe Mariners, on a 10-game unbeaten run stretching back to December, were full of confidence as they targeted another huge upset but were unable to capitalise on their late chances.\n\n\"From my side, we much prefer to play on a better pitch,\" Artell told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We have limited a Premier League side to one shot on target. I don't think either side did enough to win the game, but those are the fine margins.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

    "description": "BBC Scotland looks at Youssef Chermiti's impact for Rangers against Hearts and beyond.",
    "fullText": "A multi-million pound signing, openly derided and much-maligned. Yet, in the two biggest games of Rangers' season, he's been the hero.\n\nYoussef Chermiti cost the Ibrox club a fee of around £8m in the summer, having not scored a goal in two years.\n\nHis name was attached to criticism of former sporting director Kevin Thelwell, with his unconvincing early performances only adding fuel to the fire of his doubters.\n\nYet, against Celtic in the new year's derby, he came good. His two goals shot Rangers to a 3-1 win at Celtic Park, leading to Wilfried Nancy being sacked and pushing Danny Rohl's side past Celtic in the Scottish Premiership table for the first time this season.\n\nOn Sunday, he started in the biggest game of the season so far against league leaders Hearts. Trailing by five points, a win was a must.\n\nThanks to Chermiti, that's what they got.\n\nWith the weight of the world on his shoulders, the Portuguese striker scored a first ever career hat-trick and heaved a chunk of momentum back behind Rangers in the title charge.\n\nWatch: Rangers v Hearts - Sportscene highlights\n\nThe strangest thing about all this - Chermiti has scored just seven league goals this season. Five of them in two games. Two big games, right enough, but two games all the same.\n\nInterestingly enough, he is actually outperforming his xG of just 5.21, despite some notable misses.\n\nThe 21-year-old ranks just 15th in the league's strikers in that metric. When you look at his touches in the opposition box - 60 in total - he ranks down in 26th.\n\nIn 15 league games, 10 of which were starts, he went goalless. Before the 4-2 win over Hearts, he had drawn a blank in his past six games.\n\nFor all that, his impact in big games is immeasurable. Yet, pundit Michael Stewart remains unconvinced.\n\n\"He scored a hat-trick today, which is wonderful for him, but his all-round game is a little bit slack, and his touch at times is very unpredictable,\" said Stewart on Sportscene.\n\nThe opinion that really matters, though, is that of his gaffer and Rohl is clearly a big fan.\n\n\"You give him belief and trust,\" the head coach said through the week, when asked about his striker.\n\n\"You can imagine for Youssef, it's tough for him. Not about the reaction [from fans], it's more about how he feels.\n\n\"He knows he wants to score. He wants a lot for the group. He comes in a good situation. I wish that the next time he takes an extra touch and then he looks for the corner, he makes it.\n\n\"It will come, I totally believe, because I see a lot of things in him.\n\n\"It was the Celtic game when he scored, he turned the game with fantastic goals, and he can do this again. I believe, totally.\"\n\nNot a bad prediction from the 36-year-old, who has masterminded Rangers' resurgent form.\n\nPodcast: Dramatic Sunday in Premiership as Celtic & Rangers narrow gap on leaders Hearts\n\nIn Rohl's first weekend as Rangers boss, they leapt from eighth to fifth thanks to a 3-1 win over Kilmarnock, which featured Chermiti's first goal for the Ibrox club. They were 13 points behind Hearts before a ball was kicked.\n\nYet now, with 11 games of this rollercoaster season left, Rangers are just two behind Derek McInnes' pacesetters.\n\nIt's a turnaround that few could have predicted, and many Rangers fans had already effectively written the league off.\n\nIn 19 league matches in charge, Rohl has won 14, drawn four and lost just one - to Hearts at Tynecastle Park back in December.\n\n\"It's not been pretty for Rangers for the most of this season,\" former Rangers midfielder Scott Arfield said on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. \"Danny Rohl has gone in there and quietly got this team firing again.\"\n\nThe importance of the new head coach cannot be understated, and even caught the eye of Scotland boss Steve Clarke.\n\n\"He's found a way of playing that suits the squad of players that he's got,\" Clarke said on Sky Sports. \"He showed midweek [against Motherwell] that he's not afraid to make changes, so he trusts his squad.\n\n\"When you win matches you get more confidence. If you come in as a manager and start by winning games, immediately the players are going to be onside.\n\n\"The players are with him, the crowd are with him as well. It's been a really good run for Rangers and they're certainly doing very well at the moment.\"\n\nChermiti hat-trick earns Rangers seismic win over leaders Hearts\n\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "France were at their swaggering best in Wales to extend their bid for a first Six Nations Grand Slam since 2022 - so who could stop them?",
    "fullText": "Perhaps it was lost in translation, but Fabien Galthie's declaration that Grand Slam-chasing France \"performed reasonably\" against Wales should be enough to strike fear into Italy, Scotland and England.\n\nWhile the Welsh attempt to somehow avoid a third-straight Wooden Spoon, Les Bleus are hunting a first clean sweep since 2022.\n\nReigning champions France swatted aside Ireland in round one and ran eight tries past Wales in front of a large travelling contingent at the Principality Stadium.\n\nPart three of the Grand Slam bid is against dangerous Italy in Lille on Sunday before Scotland away and England in Paris.\n\n\"We can't stop moving forward,\" said Galthie. \"We are performing reasonably but nothing is sure.\n\n\"We expect a difficult encounter against Italy, so are still working. We had many great parts against Wales but we can do better.\"\n\nIn some ways, what Les Bleus achieved in Cardiff was nothing special - Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa had already hit Steve Tandy's side for half-centuries in the autumn.\n\nThe home side felt their performance was reasonable - and certainly better than in the round one hammering by England - yet they were still overwhelmed in all departments.\n\nFrance scored their first try after 88 seconds and had three inside the opening 15 minutes, with 20-year-old centre Fabien Brau-Boirie scoring on his debut and electric wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey going over for his 23rd try in 24 internationals.\n\nBielle-Biarrey's fellow wing Theo Attissogbe, who has replaced France's all-time record try-scorer Damian Penaud in the side, scored twice in the second half as the visitors claimed their biggest Six Nations triumph in the Welsh capital.\n\nThey could have had even more with an attack marshalled by Antoine Dupont and Matthieu Jalibert racking up 28 line breaks, 31 defenders beaten, 1,136 carry metres and 24 offloads.\n\nInstead, their final try came in the 60th minute from second row Charles Ollivon.\n\n\"When you play a team like that you have to be good at everything,\" said former England and British and Irish Lions captain Martin Johnson on BBC One.\n\n\"France had zero worries because they knew they were going to win, they knew they were too good.\n\n\"They're all so comfortable on the ball. When they're confident and there's no jeopardy, I was thinking 'thank god I'm not on that field'.\n\n\"It's so difficult to contain them when they're that confident and don't feel that anything is going to go wrong for them.\"\n\nJohnson won five Six Nations titles as a player but only two Grand Slams, so knows that potential banana skins lie ahead for Les Bleus.\n\n\"France are massive favourites to win this tournament, everyone is talking about how good they are,\" he said.\n\n\"You've got to deal with that expectation. They're looking very good, they've got huge depth, they've got massive confidence at the moment, but you've got to get them into a point where they feel pressure.\"\n\nFellow former Lions captain Sam Warburton - who won a Grand Slam and title with Wales - believes that is easier said than done.\n\n\"France have got that double-edged sword of physicality up front and the ball-playing ability out wide,\" said the former flanker.\n\n\"They're so potent in attack, they're so difficult to defend against. France are great, I love watching France.\"\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nThat swagger is providing plenty of entertainment for French supporters, who were rewarded for their long weekend in Cardiff with a thumping win.\n\nIt was Wales' smallest Six Nations crowd despite an impressive travelling contingent that boosted the coffers of the capital's pubs.\n\nPlenty will venture to Murrayfield with great expectations, and a little more trepidation.\n\n\"At the end when they were singing, we felt like we were in the Stade de France,\" said star scrum-half Dupont.\n\n\"It's incredible to feel that you are at home when playing away.\"\n\nA win in Lille and another in Edinburgh would give France the chance to secure an 11th Grand Slam against England, the last team to beat them in the Six Nations when Steve Borthwick's side clinched a dramatic 26-25 victory in round two of last year's championship.\n\nTandy is well placed to judge France's qualities after a tough start to his reign that has featured assignments against the Pumas, All Blacks, Springboks and England.\n\n\"They're in a great space to achieve that, but the Six Nations is funny,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"There's no complacency there and they are playing at a high level, so I don't see why they can't win the Grand Slam. They're a formidable outfit.\"\n\n'Murrayfield pain will make England a better team'\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC",

    "description": "Matt Weston becomes the first Briton to win two gold medals at a Winter Olympics with a thrilling victory in the mixed team skeleton alongside Tabitha Stoecker.",
    "fullText": "Team GB made history by winning two Winter Olympic titles on one day for the first time as Matt Weston and Tabitha Stoecker clinched mixed team skeleton gold.\n\nIt came after Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale won the snowboard cross mixed team event earlier on Sunday.\n\nWeston produced a stunning race to make more of his own history in Cortina - he is the first Briton to win two gold medals at a Winter Olympics having claimed individual gold just two days ago.\n\nStoecker, 25, had given Weston a tough task with her run of 1:00.77, 0.18 seconds off the pace of the Germans, with the British pair - ranked top seeds - the last to run.\n\nBut 28-year-old Weston, who won Team GB's first medal at the Games, showed why he is the best skeleton racer in the world with a sublime 58.59secs run to clinch a second medal with a final time of 1:59:36.\n\nIt is also the first time Great Britain have won three gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.\n\n\"The individual event is amazing but doing it as a team when we're normally an individual sport is amazing,\" said Weston.\n\n\"To have my team-mate by my side as Olympic champions, two-time for me which is crazy. I'm looking forward to the celebrations!\"\n\nA second British team, Marcus Wyatt and Freya Tarbit, missed out on a medal by an agonising 0.01secs as the two German teams of Christopher Grotheer and Jacqueline Pfeifer and Axel Jungk and Susanne Kreher took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nGB's Bankes & Nightingale win historic snowboard gold\n\nHow Weston handled pressure to win Olympic gold and GB's first medal\n\nWhy are Team GB so good at skeleton?\n\nThe mixed event, making its debut at Milan-Cortina, sees the sliders hurtle down the track one after the other with a quick reaction time crucial as five red lights going out prompts them to set off.\n\nPushing off before the lights go out results in heavy penalties or even disqualification and that led to many of the sliders erring on the side of caution with some hesitant starts.\n\nJanine Flock, who won gold on Saturday in the women's event, blew the Austrian team's chances when she incurred a one-second penalty for reacting too soon at the start, opening the door for both British teams to get on the podium.\n\nBut the two German teams were too good and the only way Wyatt and Tarbit could have got on the podium would have been if Weston and Stoecker had not.\n\nTwo-time world champion Weston came into this Games stating that only gold would be good enough and he will now walk away as the most decorated man in British Winter Olympics history.\n\nAfter finishing 15th in Beijing four years ago, Weston's rise in the sport has been meteoric and his two Olympic golds add to the three Crystal Globes - overall World Cup titles - he won consecutively from 2024.\n\nFormer bobsledder John Jackson, Olympic bronze medallist in 2014, said: \"Weston has been the cream of the crop of anybody on this track. We are witnessing history right here.\n\n\"He just keeps raising the bar to new standards, and that was absolutely nail-biting stuff when Tabby didn't quite have the run she wanted to give him a chance. Weston absolutely destroyed the field.\"\n\nAs Sunday's competition got increasingly exciting, building to a gripping finale, it was Weston who once again stepped up, having broken the track record in all four runs of the individual event, he produced another immaculate run to turn it into a Super Sunday for GB.\n\n\"Luckily I felt like I knew what I needed to do,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's all a bit of a whirlwind, I took confidence from the individual event and in my head I had to be quite boring and just get the job done.\"\n\nIt took Team GB a week of action in Italy to get their first medal on the board after a series of fourth-place finishes and near misses from the nation's other medal contenders.\n\nBut securing two gold medals in one day - with Bankes and Nightingale's a first ever on snow - certainly goes a long way to improving the landscape.\n\nWhile the one in Livigno came as a surprise, Weston and Stoecker's in Cortina marks a return to the norm for Team GB on the skeleton track.\n\nThe British team have a long history of Olympic skeleton success but a disastrous Games in 2022, where they failed to win a medal for the first time since the sport was reinstated at the Olympics in 2002, is now proving to be an anomaly.\n\nWeston was the heavy favourite coming into the men's event on Friday and he clinched gold with a winning margin of 0.88secs - the second-biggest in skeleton history.\n\nThen, although the British trio of women - Stoecker, Tarbit and Amelia Coltman - did not finish on the podium, they all ended inside the top 10 at their debut Games.\n\nWyatt, who finished ninth in the men's event, said: \"Me and Matt were there in Beijing [2022] and it was good to come and prove that that was a blip and not a trend.\n\n\"What these medals will do for the future of this programme for the next four, eight, 12 years - we are going to be expecting more medals and keeping that rich history of British skeleton alive.\"\n\nWhy first gold on snow has been just a matter of time",
