    "fullText": "If you were looking to wash the taste of a bitter 2025 Texas A&M baseball season out of your moth, this weekend was a good way to start. The Aggies hosted Tennessee Tech for a season-opening series at Blue Bell Park, and dominated from start to finish, sweeping the Golden Eagles by a combined score of 45-14.\n\nCertainly the season was never going to be decided on opening weekend. After all, the Ags swept Elon to begin the 2025 season that ended in massive disappointment. But if you’re looking for reasons for optimism, the Aggies scored 13 more runs than opening weekend last year, and much more importantly committed no errors after committing five on opening weekend a year ago.\n\nIt’s also safe to say that a lineup that includes both Caden Sorrell and Gavin Grahovac, in addition to a slew of newcomers, has a chance to keep this team in a ton of games.\n\nThe Aggies host A&M-Corpus Christi for a midweek tilt at 6 p.m. on Tuesday before another weekend series at Blue Bell Park next weekend against Penn. All games can be streamed on SEC Network+.",

    "description": "Keselowski is now 0-17 in the Daytona 500, and he was critical of Herbst's driving in the final seconds of the race",
    "fullText": "Entering the 2026 Daytona 500, there were concerns around if the 42-year-old Brad Keselowski could even run the full race. He showed up to the track with a walking cane, following a December fall that left him with a broken femur.\n\nBut Keselowski quickly returned to form, and was a contender throughout Sunday's 68th running of the Daytona 500 — his 17th start in 'The Great American Race.'\n\nExiting Turn 4, he had a massive run. A push from 23XI teammate Riley Herbst helped Tyler Reddick making the winning pass, but Herbst was still eying 500 glory for himself. He went to the outside of Chase Elliott in the pass for second, but Keselowski was already there with a helpful push from Logano.\n\nAs the two drivers went for the same piece of race track, a massive crash ensued across the line with Keselowski finishing fifth, suffering heavy nose-damage. Keselowski was frustrated afterwards, and openly criticized, who at the same time was being praised by 23XI co-owner Michael Jordan for helping Reddick to win the 500.\n\n\"That was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen,\" said Keselowski. \"He had no chance of blocking my run. I had a huge run, I don't know if I could have gotten the 45 [Reddick], but I would have liked to have found out because my run was coming fast. The 35 [Herbst] just wrecked us in itself.\n\nKeselowski then added: \"I thought, well, you know, a one-lane block kind of makes sense, but to block from the very bottom all the way to the top and wreck yourself and everybody else is just stupid. Very, very stupid.\"\n\nThe positive for Keselowski, beyond still scoring a top five finish, is that his leg felt fine. It didn't bother him during the race, and he exited the car under his own power. \"Felt really good in the car, felt really good getting through the crash, and I'm happy for that.\"\n\nHowever, video shows that Herbst was holding the middle lane before trying to come up into Keselowski's lane to pass Elliott, but the late block still resulted in a massive crash. In the end, it was another possible Daytona 500 victory slipping through his fingertips, and a winless streak that now sits at 60 races.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Kansas State has reportedly parted ways with men's basketball coach Jerome Tang after it fell to 1-11 in Big 12 play on Saturday afternoon",
    "fullText": "MANHATTAN — The Jerome Tang era at Kansas State is over.\n\nThe basketball coach has been fired after four seasons of leading the Wildcats, according to a national report by On3's Pete Nakos and Joe Tipton. The university has yet to comment.\n\nKansas Stateis coming off a 78-64 loss to No. 3 Houston on Saturday, Feb. 14. The Wildcats are scheduled to host Baylor on Tuesday, Feb. 17, at 8 p.m.\n\nThe Wildcats are 10-15 overall with a 1-11 record in Big 12 play. They have six games remaining before the Big 12 Tournament in Kansas City.\n\nTang's buyout sits at $18.675 million. It was the nation's 12th-largest buyout figure entering the 2025-26 season, according to the USA TODAY Coaches Salary Database. It's believed to be the largest publicly known buyout in college basketball history.\n\nThe Tang era at Kansas State began with so much promise after he led the Wildcats to an Elite Eight appearance in his first season, 2022-23, only to take many steps back in the following three seasons.\n\nTang finished his K-State career with a 71-57 overall record. He made $3.6 million as Kansas State's coach in 2025-26. He was the 29th-highest paid coach in the country a season ago.\n\nTang has an offset clause in his contract, meaning the coach will be required to make a reasonable effort to obtain subsequent employment as long as Kansas State is obligated to pay his buyout over the next 24 months. K-State will be relieved on a dollar-for-dollar basis, provided the coach receives pay from sources directly related to being a college or professional coach, analyst, or administrator, as long as the pay is at an actual market rate.\n\nThe buyout is the largest in Kansas State athletics history. Tang replaced Bruce Weber, whom Kansas State paid a $1 million buyout after the coach resigned following the 2021-22 season. The Wildcats haven't had to fire a football coach since Ron Prince in 2008, when the two sides resolved a contract dispute that resulted in a $1.65 million buyout. The school gave Bill Snyder a $3 million payout upon his retirement after the 2018 football season.\n\nDuring his Kansas State career, Tang made north of $12.7 million, and will now more than double that with his buyout.\n\nTang had five years remaining on his contract.\n\nThe Tang era started out better than anyone could have hoped for, but the Wildcats have taken steps back each season since.\n\nKansas State was in the Elite Eight after a 26-10 record, while Tang earned Naismith National Coach of the Year honors in 2022-23. That led to Tang receiving a contract extension.\n\nThe Wildcats took a step back in 2023-24, going 19-15 and missing the NCAA Tournament. After that season, Tang was tied to openings at Arkansas and others, which led K-State to give him a raise and more guaranteed money to keep him. That's why his buyout is so massive.\n\nThat didn't lead to better results in 2024-25. A drama-filled year saw the Wildcats finish 16-17, while much was made about the Name, Image, and Likeness deals on the roster.\n\nHoping for better results, playing with a revamped but still expensive roster, the Wildcats are still struggling in 2025-26. After starting the season 5-0 and having a chance to beat Nebraska, the Wildcats have imploded since Big 12 play began. They began league play 0-5, the program's worst start since 1996-97, and never got any better.\n\nWyatt D. Wheeler covers Kansas State athletics for the USA TODAY Network and Topeka Capital-Journal.

    "description": "Laura Ziegler led Louisville Cardinals women's basketball past the Florida State Seminoles in an ACC college basketball game Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Louisville women’s basketball was forced to deviate from its normal game-opening play — a pass in the low post to Anaya Hardy for a quick layup — against Florida State on Sunday.\n\nThe Seminoles took the look away from the ninth-ranked Cardinals. The only problem was that their double team left Laura Ziegler open. The senior called for the ball and nailed the shot beyond the arc. One minute later, Taj Roberts found Ziegler in the paint for a layup. After one quarter, Ziegler had either scored or assisted on seven of the Cardinals’ eight made field goals while tallying five rebounds.\n\nThe first 10 minutes of Louisville’s ACC game against Florida State (9-17, 4-10 ACC) is what the Saint Joseph’s transfer has been doing all season. And it yielded a similar result to all but four of the Cardinals’ games as Louisville (24-4, 14-1) took down the Seminoles, 88-65, on Sunday at the KFC Yum! Center.\n\nA day after UofL was projected to be a No. 2 seed in the first NCAA Tournament Top 16 reveal, Ziegler showed why as she helped the team build a 34-20 halftime lead. She neared triple-double territory by finishing with 14 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Louisville was +28 when she was on the court, covered every inch by contributing in some way. That ranged from bringing the ball up the floor to battling in the post or getting the outlet pass for a 3-point shot.\n\nZiegler’s versatility is something head coach Jeff Walz saw from her film at Saint Joseph’s. After getting her on campus, he tried her out at the point forward position.\n\n“She passed the ball well,\" Walz said last week. “And she handles it well enough that at the 4 spot, there aren't many 4 players that are going to pick her up full-court. So, the advantage to her then is like, 'Hey, no one's really harassing me a whole bunch.' And then when teams start to put guards on her, she's bigger than they are so she can see over them. And now we're making the pass up to our guard who's being guarded by a post.”\n\nZiegler has been open to any role the team needs her to play and contributes more than just scoring. Her leadership as one of only two seniors on the roster has been invaluable. Beyond the intangibles, Ziegler leads the team in rebounds per game (7.2) and is second in points (11.5) and assists per game (2.9).\n\nHer all-around effort has helped Louisville to one of its most successful seasons over the past few years and will continue to be important with the postseason looming.\n\nLouisville is off Thursday and returns to the KFC Yum! Center to host Virginia at noon next Sunday.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Louisville women's basketball, Laura Ziegler roll past Florida State",

They are the only team that did not allow a power-play goal in the preliminary round.\n\n3-0! ✅✅✅ #WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/CQkF0QVOeB\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 15, 2026\n\nTrocheck and Miller composed the first forward grouping utilized by coach Mike Sullivan, helping the Americans shut down a German power play that featured NHL stars Leon Draisaitl, Tim Stutzle, and Moritz Seider.\n\nMiller received shoulder pats for a shot block late in the third period on USA’s third and final penalty kill. He also connected on a stretch pass with Jack Eichel at the close of the first PK, springing the Vegas Golden Knights center for a breakaway chance — although Eichel was denied by German goalie Maximilian Franzreb.\n\nThe win cemented a perfect 3-0-0 stretch in the preliminary round for the Americans. They won Group C by three points and locked up the No. 2 seed, behind only Canada, who were 3-0-0 with a plus-17 goal differential atop Group A.\n\nMiller logged 12:37 TOI, and Trocheck played a team-low 9:12 Sunday. Each was even with one shot on goal.\n\nTrocheck has two assists — both on game-winning goals — and is plus-two in three games. The 32-year-old center ranks third among all Olympic skaters with a 66.7 face-off percentage, winning 18 of 27 draws. Miller is minus-one and failed to record a point in Group C play — one of four USA skaters yet to hit the score-sheet entering the quarterfinal.\n\nQUARTERFINALS:\n\n(1) Canada vs (8) Czechia/(9) Denmark winner\n(2) USA vs (7) Sweden/(10) Latvia winner\n(3) Slovakia vs (6) Germany/(11) France winner\n(4) Finland vs (5) Switzerland/(12) Italy winner\n\nRe-seeding will take place for semifinals\n\n— Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) February 15, 2026\n\nUSA earned an automatic bid to the Olympic quarterfinals thanks to the win over Germany. The winner of the qualification play-off between No. 7 Sweden and No. 10 Latvia on Tuesday will face the Americans on Wednesday. Should Sweden prevail, Miller and Trocheck will go toe-to-toe with Rangers teammate Mika Zibanejad.\n\nA German team headed by Draisaitl posed the biggest challenge for Team USA in Group C.\n\n“We need to think of this game as a playoff-type atmosphere,” Sullivan told his squad ahead of puck drop.\n\n“That’s exactly what we did,” Minnesota Wild defenseman Brock Faber said postgame. “I thought we played a solid three periods.”\n\nFor the second game in a row, the Americans got off to a clunky start — highlighted by an awkward collision between New Jersey Devils star Jack Hughes and USA captain Auston Matthews on a Team USA power play.\n\nAuston Matthews and Jack Hughes had a massive open ice collision 😳 pic.twitter.com/P0OSRROuD9\n\n— B/R Open Ice (@BR_OpenIce) February 15, 2026\n\nEichel appeared to give the Americans a 1-0 lead in the final minute of the first period, but officials whistled the play dead before his shot, after Matthew Thachuk was checked into the crease, knocking the blocker off of Franzreb.\n\nUndeterred, USA struck before the horn sounded to close the opening frame. Matthews sent a beautiful saucer pass cross-ice, setting up Zach Werenski for a sharp wrister from the left dot at 19:51.\n\n“These games come quick,” Matthews noted at the first intermission. “We didn’t love our effort the first half of the game last night, so we wanted to come out and have a good start, and I thought we did that.”\n\nThey carried that momentum into the second period. After Miller and Trocheck helped kill an Eichel penalty 50 seconds into the frame, USA flipped the tables with a power play of their own.\n\nThis time around, Matthews got to lead the handshake line, gravitating to the front of the net and getting a stick on a shot from Quinn Hughes at 3:25.\n\nFaber gave USA a 3-0 lead at 17:35, quickly firing a high shot from the point that ricocheted off Franzreb’s glove and into the net.\n\nThe Americans made it 4-0 at 1:55 of the third period on a clapper from Tage Thompson, and Matthews tallied his second with another deflection at 6:46.\n\nStutzle netted the lone goal for Germany with a pretty snipe at 11:22.\n\nMatthews posted a game-high three points (two goals, one assist) Sunday; the Toronto Maple Leafs star leads all American skaters with three goals and five points in three games.\n\nA two-piece combo for Auston Matthews. ✌️#WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/vkQzJrWfJb\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 15, 2026\n\nUSA outscored its opponents 16-5 in Group C play. Of course, tougher challenges likely await them — namely, a dominant Canadian squad, fresh off a 10-2 rout of France on Sunday.\n\n“There’s stuff that we need to clean up,” Faber acknowledged. “But overall, I thought we got better as the tournament went on, and that’s what it’s all about. Now it gets real.”\n\nUSA gets two days of rest ahead of their quarterfinal matchup.

    "fullText": "Player trades in the NFL have become more common in recent years, and one NFL insider believes the trend will continue this offseason.\n\nOn a recent episode of “The Adam Schefter Podcast,” the ESPN NFL reporter said it may be tougher for teams to get impact players this season through traditional means, meaning teams will likely be involved in more trades.\n\n“When we talk about the draft, and we’ll see how it shakes out over time, people aren’t all that excited about the draft,” Schefter said. “We got a free-agent class that’s not really deep. We’ve got a draft that is not considered really deep. You know what that tells me? More trades. That’s what it tells me. It tells me we may get more wheeling and dealing in trades than we’ve had in other years.”\n\nSchefter added that although he has not heard any specific trades that are brewing, he sees the activity around the Nov. 4 trade deadline as an indication of teams willing to make more deals to fix their rosters.\n\nThe trade market could be utilized by teams to acquire quarterbacks. This year’s quarterback draft class is not projected to be as strong as recent years, with Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza expected to go as the first overall pick and Alabama’s Ty Simpson appearing to be the only other quarterback projected as a first-round selection.\n\nKyler Murray (Arizona Cardinals) and Mac Jones (San Francisco 49ers) are expected to be the top targets on the trade market, with Raiders quarterback Geno Smith also expected to garner interest.\n\nOn the defensive side, Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby could be another player moved, although it has been previously reported that a deal for him could come after he finishes recovering from a knee injury he suffered late last season.",

In early February, the Celtics assigned him to participate in portions of a practice with their G League affiliate, the Maine Celtics, at the Auerbach Center. This included his first 5-on-5 scrimmage since the injury, involving rostered players, two-way players, and G Leaguers. Tatum described the session as the next logical step in his plan, noting he felt good afterward and emphasizing a focus on daily improvement without committing to an immediate return. He stressed following the structured progression to ensure full readiness.\n\nTeammate Jaylen Brown offered positive feedback recently, stating that Tatum “looks pretty damn good” based on what he’s observed during this phase. Reports indicate Tatum has ramped up activity aggressively, with no setbacks mentioned, and he continues individual on-court work alongside team integration efforts. Celtics president Brad Stevens has maintained a cautious approach, prioritizing Tatum being fully cleared medically and mentally at 110% before any game action.\n\nWhile a return this season remains possible, Tatum has expressed that he wants to come back at full strength, not as a diminished version of himself. Discussions continue, with no firm timeline set.\n\nCeltics’ Jaylen Brown Reveals UFC Aspirations",

    "description": "The UW-Milwaukee Panthers led for less than 2 minutes on Feb. 15, using the free throw line to climb back against their rival, UW-Green Bay.",
    "fullText": "Because the whistles had been so plentiful, Stevie Elam’s defense in the waning moments had to be perfect.\n\nIt was ‒ depending on who you ask.\n\nAs a foul-ridden contest between rivals came to a close at UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena on Feb. 15, UW-Green Bay guard Preston Ruedinger wisely attacked the rim with his team trailing by a point and the clock under 10 seconds. Expecting at the very least to draw some contact and a whistle, all he instead encountered was Elam stripping the ball away.\n\nThe freshman stripped Ruedinger, then sank two free throws to ice a 75-72 win for the Panthers to avoid what would have been the first sweep to their in-state foes since 2018-19.\n\n\"He had to get that ball pretty clean,\" Milwaukee head coach Bart Lundy said. \"They were driving with force. We had a couple plays before that where it looked like we stopped them and we did get whistled. But Stevie Elam's strength as a true freshman, his hand strength is off the charts; it's probably NFL-level.\"\n\nLundy's counterpart disagreed, to say the least.\n\n\"The last play of the game, just to get the ball they were grabbing us and holding us,\" Phoenix head coach Doug Gottlieb said. \"Again, I understand if you're not calling that, that's fine. You had the exact same play at both ends in the last play of the game.\"\n\nGottlieb paused, ever so briefly, then aggressively slammed his fists into the table atop the dais.\n\n\"The exact same [expletive] play,\" Gottlieb yelled. \"The exact same play.\"\n\nGottlieb was fed up with the officiating crew from the afternoon after receiving a technical foul and seeing his team shoot 18 free throws compared to Milwaukee's 37. He specifically called out the technical he received in the second half with just under 7 minutes to play and his team up three, as well as a loose-ball foul on CJ O'Hara with 4:25 to go and his team up four.\n\n\"I need the new commissioner of the Horizon League to explain to me what a technical foul is when I don't leave the box, I don't curse, I'm not demonstrative,\" Gottlieb said. \"There was nothing, nothing that should have been called a technical foul. I know when I earn one. I did not earn one. The CJ play, we're up [four] points, that dramatically changed the [trajectory] of the game.\"\n\nPostgame tirades aside, the Panthers had to overcome a huge night from Green Bay’s Marcus Hall to do so, as the junior from Schofield, Wisconsin, had 32 points and seven rebounds.\n\nCentral to Milwaukee’s efforts in doing so: free throws and Chandler Jackson, who scored 23 points.\n\nTwenty-four of the Panthers' free throws came in the second half, and they hit 22 of them – despite being one of the worst free-throw shooting teams in the country at 68.5% entering the day.\n\nMilwaukee led for only 1 minute, 53 seconds in total.\n\nAfter cutting the lead to one three times prior in the final minutes, the Panthers took the lead with 69 seconds left when Esyah Pippa-White was fouled going for a defensive rebound and hit a pair of free throws.\n\nOn the other end, Hall corralled his own miss and laid it back up with 45 seconds left to put the Phoenix up 72-71.\n\nBut Amar Augillard wisely drove to the basket on the other end, where he drew a foul much to Gottlieb's chagrin and hit Milwaukee’s 19th and 20th free throws of the half.\n\n\"Our end, [if] you don't want to call a foul, he drove into traffic, whatever,\" the Phoenix second-year coach and former radio host said. \"It's the exact same play as the other end. Could not be more similar. And yet every time they drove in there it was a foul, and every time we did it was a miss.\"\n\nMilwaukee shot 19 more free throws than Green Bay despite drawing only five more fouls.\n\nJackson went 8 for 8 from the stripe as he finished two points shy of his career-high of 25 points, which he set in Milwaukee’s most recent game, Feb. 10 at IU Indy.\n\nInitially thought of as a likely redshirt candidate, Jackson has become arguably the heavily injured Panthers' most-consistent scorer of late. He’s averaging 14.1 points over his past eight games.\n\n\"To see Chandler from June to where he is now, he's just a different guy, different player,\" Lundy said. \"When we inserted Chandler, we really inserted him for his communication. He helps everyone get better defensively. That's what got him the opportunity and everything has grown from that. It wasn't like he was in practice scoring at will on everyone. He talked. He communicated. He cared.\"\n\nElam was the only other Milwaukee player to reach double-digit scoring, finishing with 11 points.\n\nWith the win, the Panthers moved a half-game clear of Youngstown State and Cleveland State for eighth place in the Horizon League, which matters because the 10th and 11th place teams face off in a play-in for the conference tournament.\n\nGreen Bay left the building, meanwhile, in a tie for third – and forcefully demanding answers from the conference.\n\n\"All we ask is that there's a fair game. That's what we ask,\" Gottlieb said. \"CJ O'Hara goes and gets an offensive rebound, their player dives at his legs and CJ gets called for a foul. I need [Jill Bodensteiner] at the league, our new commissioner, to explain to me the disparity in the officiating. That's what I need explained to me.\n\n\"I have no problem with their team, their staff. They played hard. They did what they do. They played tough and they played aggressive. I need somebody to explain to me, just those two. There are others I have massive issues with, including every time we touched them there was a foul in the second half.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Doug Gottlieb goes on postgame tirade after Milwaukee beats Green Bay",

Hannah Hidalgo led the way with 19 points to go along with eight rebounds, six steals and six assists. Cassandre Prosper and Iyana Moore each scored 14 and Malaya Cowles added 13.\n\nThe Irish never trailed in the first frame and led by as many as eight at 10-2 just 4 minutes into the contest before holding a three-point advantage with the score 17-14 following the opening 10 minutes of play.

    "description": "Seahawks with a stunning hire to run their offense",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks became victims of their own success this season when the Las Vegas Raiders hired away offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak to be their next head coach. With Kubiak gone, this presented an obvious hole that needed filling in their coaching staff. Seattle was widely expected to promote from within, and understandably so. However, the Seahawks often \"zag\" when folks expect them to \"zig\" and they did so once more.\n\nOn Sunday, it was reported by ESPN's Adam Schefter that Seattle is expected to hire San Francisco 49ers tight end coach Brian Fleury to be their next offensive coordinator. This was a name that was not on anyone's radar... anyone except Mike Macdonald, of course.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Nick Wagoner and Brady Henderson, Fleury was heavily involved in San Francisco's ground attack, as his official position last season was tight ends/run game coordinator. Henderson also notes with Fleury coming from the same Shanahan coaching line as Kubiak, the continuity will be kept largely in tact for quarterback Sam Darnold. This was exactly the logic for hiring within, so going with Fleury does make sense in this regard.\n\nFleury also brings intimate knowledge of Seattle's most hated rival. He's been with the Niners since 2019 in various coaching roles, and of course also knows how best to attack both the Rams and Arizona Cardinals. Although, this will be Fleury's first time as an offensive coordinator, and with Mike Macdonald focusing primarily on defense, he will have a lot on his plate as the one in full control of the offense.\n\nThe Seahawks will begin their title defense with a rookie offensive coordinator, but if Mike Macdonald's earned anything it's our trust he's made the right call.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks moves: 49ers TE coach Brian Fleury new offensive coordinator",

I've been here the longest now, and it's frustrating,\" Webb exclaimed.\n\nMore: Giants sign former Guardians outfielder in late free agent move\n\nThe frustration Webb speaks of is justified, since being a mediocre team can be worse than being at the bottom of the barrel, especially if the team remains the same.\n\nHowever, whenever one of the best players on the team is stating how much he is tired of losing and individual is not enough more and winning is the top priority, it can end up lighting a positive fire under the team to go out there and turn things around, which is what the franchise needs as that 2021 postseason is the only appearance for San Francisco in the last nine seasons, but before that the team had won three World Series titles over five seasons from 2010-2014.\n\nIf the Giants don't begin to turn their fortunes around, that could start to upset Webb to the point where he may eventually want to be traded to a better situation. A dominant starting pitcher like Webb does not come around as often as one might think.\n\nBased on the resume that Webb has built for himself, he will be play a huge role in the team having success if that happens this season, especially if the all-star can have anywhere close to the season that he had last year, where he recorded a 15-11 record, 3.22 ERA, and 224 strikeouts, which was good for third most in the league behind only Tarik Skubal and Garrett Crochet.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nAn Edwin Diaz nightmare looms for the Mets\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nWe now know what the ABS challenge system strike zone will look like\n\nSpencer Strider's finish to 2025 changes everything for Braves",

    "fullText": "BOCA RATON — Florida Atlantic’s men’s basketball team continued its shocking free fall on Feb. 15. The Owls lost 83-81 in overtime to first-place South Florida in an American Conference state showdown.\n\nKanaan Carlyle, playing for the time since Feb. 1, missed a game-winning three-point attempt in the final seconds to seal the Owls’ (14-12, 6-7) fate.\n\nAfter starting out conference play 6-1 and sitting in first place, FAU’s losing streak has now reached six games, and the Owls have fallen to 10th in the razor-thin standings.\n\nMore college basketball: Florida basketball makes another statement in SEC race by dispatching Kentucky\n\nCarlyle scored 15 points on 5-for-13 shooting in his return. Devin Vanterpool led FAU with 26 points, and USF (18-8, 10-3) was led by Wes Enis with a game-high 27 points.\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to Rice on Feb. 11, the Owls were able to go toe-to-toe with the best team in the American, but couldn’t secure the victory.\n\n“I think we’re going to get hot,” FAU coach John Jakus said. “We’ll keep it going.”\n\nFAU will be back in action on Feb. 18 for a road matchup in San Antonio with the UTSA Roadrunners.\n\nHere are the takeaways from the latest loss:\n\nPerhaps the most notable change for the Owls was the return of starting point guard Kanaan Carlyle, who has been out for three of FAU’s last four games due to a calf injury.\n\nCarlyle looked healthy while knocking down 3 of his 8 three-pointers in 36 minutes of action. The junior had a chance to win it in the closing seconds of overtime, but came up just short from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Owls’ offense hummed much more soundly than it has in recent weeks. Five Owls — Carlyle, Vanterpool, Josiah Parker, Devin Williams and Isaiah Elohim — scored in double figures, but it wasn’t enough to take down the top team in the American.\n\nNonetheless, Jakus is confident that Carlyle’s return will make life easier heading into the final stretch of the regular season.\n\n“You can tell with Kanaan back, there’s a couple things that are pretty distinctive,” Jakus said. “There was just a flow of the way we play when they play together.”\n\nAmid a deflating losing streak, Jakus opted to make an adjustment to the team’s starting lineup by inserting Parker in place of the struggling Xander Pintelon.\n\nParker entered the matchup averaging 12.5 points and 7.5 rebounds per game against American Conference opponents and had been particularly exceptional of late, averaging 17.3 points and 9.0 rebounds per game in February.\n\nParker posted a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double to go along with two blocks. The performance was histhird-consecutive double-double, fifth of the season.\n\nHis upward trajectory has been arguably the only positive to come about during FAU’s losing skid, with Jakus acknowledging the time had come for Parker to start.\n\n“He’s the best freshman in the league,” Jakus said. “He’s averaging 17 and 10 over the last five games and we haven't won, so at a certain point I’m going to make a change in the starting lineup.\n\n“I liked bringing him off the bench. I thought there was a punch to that when we were 5-1. It was fun and cute to have him coming off the bench, but it’s not cute right now. We need guys to perform.”\n\nUSF’s Wes Enis and Joseph Pinion did their best “Splash Brothers” impression, knocking down a combined nine three-pointers. In the first half, it was Enis who got hot from downtown, scoring 18 of his 27 points while hitting four of his eight three-point tries.\n\nSouth Florida shot 36 percent from the floor, and 26 percent from three as a team, before halftime, but Enis’ shooting kept the game tight.\n\nIn the second half, it was Pinion’s turn to light up the Owls from beyond the arc. After scoring 4 points on 2-for-7 shooting from the floor and 0-for-3 from downtown in the first half, Pinion scored 12 points, hitting all four of his shots from three-point range in the latter half.\n\nIn a game in which USF made 13 of 39 layups, it was the marksmanship of Enis and Pinion that led to the Owls' demise. Both players hit numerous shots that were several feet beyond the three-point line, stretching FAU’s defense to the max as the Owls struggled to contain the long-range shooters.\n\n“Some of it is the actions, some of it is falling asleep for half a second, and then some of it is the fact that they can invert the floor all the way to the volleyball line,” Jakus said. “I think the very worst mistake you make is when you’re too low, and you let them see one go in. If you’re low, it’s over.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Beach Post: USF Bulls edge FAU Owls in overtime in American Conference basketball",

    "description": "Syla Swords and Olivia Olson combined for 47 points to help Michigan women’s basketball team secure a 86-65 victory over Michigan State, the largest win in rivalry history:",
    "fullText": "Two weeks ago, the No. 7 Michigan women’s basketball eked out a three-point overtime win in East Lansing against No. 13 Michigan State.\n\nSunday afternoon told another story. With a dominant second quarter in which the Wolverines outscored the Spartans, 26-9, Michigan (22-4 overall, 13-2 Big Ten) seized momentum and never looked back to defeat Michigan State (20-6, 9-6), 86-65.\n\n“They jumped on us right away,” head coach Kim Barnes Arico said. “We weren’t able to get stops, and then we kind of settled in and really got stops for the rest of the game. Our second-quarter defense was outstanding, but I thought our defense and the way we forced turnovers all game was really exceptional. Olivia (Olson) and Syla (Swords) were both tremendous, but they had a lot of support from their teammates as well.”\n\nTrailing 21-15 following the first quarter, the Wolverines had to make an adjustment. The Spartans were driving consistently and scoring in the paint — all but three of their points resulted from paint points or free throws — while Michigan struggled to get clean looks offensively. With intense ball pressure, Michigan State sped up the Wolverines, impairing their shot selection. Despite collecting offensive rebounds, rather than resetting the offense, Michigan failed to convert on a few second chances.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Wolverines turned that trend on its head.\n\n“Second quarter, it was wild,” Michigan State head coach Robyn Fralick said. “… It was a lot of self-inflicted, just playing a little bit sped up, which we hadn’t early. And then that got us just out of rhythm, out of sorts. I mean, you can’t turn the ball over that much and be effective. And then in the second quarter, we gave up so many second shots, too, so that makes the game really hard.”\n\nInstead of speeding Michigan up, the Spartans were chasing an unsustainable pace themselves. They coughed up the ball 12 times, some unforced errors like travels or inaccurate passes, and others a direct product of the Wolverines’ sticky fingers.\n\nLed by senior guard Brooke Quarles Daniels, Michigan ramped up the pressure, pouncing on Michigan State’s mistakes and converting them into transition points.\n\n“This needs to go somewhere, but (Brooke) needs to be on that Defensive Player of the Year list,” Swords said. “She is the best defender in the country. She fuels our defense. She allows Liv to pick up full court, allows us to have a rest, because she’s picking up the best player anywhere she goes. So she really fuels the way we play, the style of play, the fast pace, the fun pace that comes from Brooke, so her name needs to be heard. She needs to be on any and every list out there.”\n\nWith the Swords-proclaimed DPOY leading the charge, the Wolverines converted 12 turnovers into 14 points, coupled with 11 second-chance points on six offensive rebounds to shoot past the Spartans with a 26-9 second quarter in which Michigan State attempted just seven total shots. The frame was most prominently marked by a stretch from 6:50 to the three-second mark of the first half in which Michigan outscored the Spartans, 19-2.\n\nMichigan State averaged 12.7 turnovers per game, with 20 as its previous season high. With 16 at halftime and finishing with 24, turnovers were the tale of the tape that separated the Wolverines for good.\n\nBut that separation factor was compounded by offensive efficiency. Michigan took better shots, and those clean looks were a byproduct of transition offense and success on the glass. Strong ball movement set up Swords, who sank two key triples to punctuate the game-defining run. Swords’ 10 second-quarter points surpassed the Spartans’ total on her own, and combined with an efficient 47 percent from the floor for 24 points overall.\n\nThe Swords-Olson tandem electrified a season-best crowd of 11,627 for a combined 47 points, including perfect 12-for-12 combined from the free throw line. Olson’s trademark midrange jumper and Swords’ splashy outside shots overpowered the Spartans’ defense, taking what was given and exploiting opportunities. Olson finished with her seventh consecutive 20-point game.\n\nWith former Michigan great Naz Hillmon in attendance for her jersey retirement, with “00” hanging from the rafters — a major reason why Olson and Swords chose Michigan — the Wolverines of today put on a show. Securing the season sweep in both the highest-ranked matchup and largest margin of victory in rivalry history for Michigan, surpassing a mark set by Hillmon’s team itself in 2020, the Wolverines wrote a new chapter in the rivalry.",

    "fullText": "One of the biggest stories for the host nation Italy at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games has been the amazing comeback story for alpine skier Federica Brignone. Many thought she would not be healthy enough to compete on the Italian slopes this month.\n\nBrignone is not just a competitor at the Winter Olympic Games at the moment, but a dominant one. She has come away with two individual gold medals with victories in the women’s giant slalom and women’s super giant slalom.\n\nBefore Sunday no skier had ever won the women’s super giant slalom and women’s giant slalom at the same Olympic Winter Games.\n\nIt has been accomplished twice on the men’s side. Markus Wasmeier of Germany won the giant slalom and super giant slalom at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer, and Herman Maier won these same two alpine skiing events at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano.\n\nThe reason why this accomplishment is noteworthy is because of the differences between a giant slalom race and super giant slalom race. The giant slalom race is a lot more technical, while the super giant slalom is associated with downhill more, and is a speed race.\n\nBrignone tore her anterior cruciate ligament during a giant slalom race at the Italian National Alpine Skiing Championships in Val di Fissa, Italy on April 3.\n\nInitially, Brignone was diagnosed with a broken tibia and broken fibula. During the operation, it was determined that Brignone had also ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament according to Lena Smirnova of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nBrignone’s crash in Italy came 10 months prior to Lindsey Vonn’s spectacular crash in Italy in the women’s downhill to begin the 2026 Olympic Winter Games.\n\nBrignone’s super giant slalom win on Thursday came with a time of 1:23.41. She beat her nearest opponent, silver medalist Romane Miradoli of France by 0.41 seconds.\n\nThen on Saturday in the giant slalom, Brignone beat silver medalists Sara Hector of Sweden and Thea Louise Stjernesund of Norway, by 0.62 seconds. Brignone’s winning time was 2:13.50.\n\nThe host nation now has eight gold medals. There is another Italian woman with two individual gold medals. That is Francesca Lollobrigida, who won gold in the women’s 3000 metres and women’s 5000 metres.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Federica Brignone comes back from torn ACL to win two Olympic gold medals appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "FC Bayern has talent in between the sticks.",
    "fullText": "As Bayern Munich continues to balance legacy with long-term planning, CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen offered thoughtful insight into one of the club’s most emotionally charged questions— the future of club legend Manuel Neuer and the rise of his potential successor, Jonas Urbig.\n\nNeuer, of course, suffered a calf injury in the team’s 3-0 victory over Werder Bremen on Saturday and will be replaced by Urbig in the starting XI until the veteran can return. Speaking about Neuer’s situation, Dreesen emphasized patience and respect for a player whose performances continue to defy time.\n\n“Manuel will be 40 on March 27. You wouldn’t believe that if you’ve followed him in recent games and seen how many incredible saves he made. We spoke early on, and he wants to give himself time and we also want to give him and ourselves time. We’ll discuss things calmly during the season and see what happens next,” Dreesen said on a recent appearance on BR24Sport.\n\nThe quote reflects Bayern’s typically measured approach to transitions involving iconic figures. Rather than forcing a timeline, the club appears committed to allowing Neuer’s performances—and his own feelings—to guide the decision. Given his enduring quality, that restraint feels both respectful and practical. Few goalkeepers in world football history have maintained elite standards so deep into their careers, and Neuer’s continued influence in big moments makes any immediate succession plan far from straightforward.\n\nAt the same time, Bayern is clearly preparing for the future. Dreesen spoke warmly about Urbig’s development and, perhaps more importantly, the relationship forming between the young goalkeeper and the veteran he may one day replace.\n\n“Jonas is doing a great job. The chemistry between him and Manu is excellent, which is particularly important. I think Manu has made it his mission to build Jonas up as his successor and pass on his experience to him. You can see that in training when they talk to each other. That makes us happy. Jonas has already shown his great potential in the games he played. He just needs to gain experience through match practice. He’s played a lot more games than those before him. I hope he continues this way,” Dreesen said.\n\nThis mentorship element is striking. Bayern’s greatest generational handovers—from past leaders to new cornerstones—have often worked best when knowledge was shared rather than guarded. If Neuer is actively shaping Urbig’s growth, the eventual transition could feel less like an ending and more like a continuation of standards.\n\nFor supporters, the message is reassuring on multiple levels. Neuer is still trusted, valued, and performing at a remarkable level. Meanwhile, the club is not standing still; it is cultivating the next era with intention and care.\n\nIn true Bayern fashion, sentiment and strategy are moving together. Whether Neuer extends his story for another season or gradually passes the gloves forward, the process appears calm, respectful, and deliberate—exactly the way a club of Bayern’s stature prefers to shape its future.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Vinicius Junior has had a difficult 18 months on the pitch, but there are signs that he’s returning to his best level at Real Madrid. He’s been in good form over the last few weeks, and it comes at an important time too, considering his uncertain future at the Bernabeu.\n\nVinicius is out of contract in June 2027, and so far, there has been no breakthrough regarding a new deal. Despite this, he’s made it clear that he’s very happy at Real Madrid, as he told Ibai Llanos (via Diario AS).\n\n“I’m very happy. Playing for Real Madrid, having the life I have and my family makes me happy. Being happy on and off the pitch is the best.”\n\nVinicius’ form has suffered since Kylian Mbappe joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2024, but according to the man himself, the pair have a great relationship both on and off the pitch. He also revealed that he was pushing the Frenchman to join in the years before he quit Paris for Madrid.\n\n“Every summer I wrote to him: ‘When are you coming?’ I acted as an agent. With Bellingham I did too. I want to play with the best to have more options to win. We spend more time with each other than with our family. We have to have a good relationship.”\n\nVinicius also responded to a question on how he manages to keep his feet on the ground after becoming a big name in football at such a young age.\n\n“When we are very young we don’t learn to be famous. I came out of nowhere to be famous and not be able to go out on the street. The good side is that people love you a lot, but the bad thing is the press and the rival fans. But I love (rival fan whistles). We train for these games. In the moments of pressure is when the best players stand out, and at Real Madrid, we are ready.”\n\nVinicius, who spoke with Ronald Araujo during the Barcelona defender’s recent break from football, revealed how he takes care of his own mental health.\n\n“You have to listen to everything, not just the good things.”",

    "description": "We ask Dolphins fans why they think that in a league geared towards offenses that it’s defense that win championships.",
    "fullText": "Last week, I wrote a post with a question of the day asking what questions you would like asked. One of the submissions was from our very own sdphinsfan. sdphinsfan pointed out the fact that the NFL has consistently adjusted the rules over the years to favor offensive production. The assumption being that exciting offenses are what the fans most want to see. But despite the league pushing for offensive production while finding ways to restrict defenses, it still seems as if defense wins championships more often than not. It’s not to say that you don’t need offensive production in the NFL, but all things equal, the postseason games tend to go to the teams that dominate on defense. This is also somewhat in contrast to the regular season, where a team with a dominant offense can win a high percentage of its games, even while fielding a subpar defense.\n\nSo the now obvious Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nIn the NFL, where the rules and the game in general are now geared toward a higher rate of offensive production and, in turn, higher scoring, why are NFL Championships still won on the backs of dominant defenses?\n\nPlease share your thougths and answers in the comment section below-",

    "title": "Implications of the Zac Gallen Signing",
    "description": "Our panelists discuss the implications of the Zac Gallen signing, how it will impact the rotation, and more!",
    "fullText": "DBacksEurope: It is probably true that Gallen improves the 2026 rotation. 2025 first half Gallen was probably a worser version of the pitcher that he actually is, but we’ve seen Zac becoming increasingly worse and frustrated over the past few seasons, to an extent where we had to conclude that he wasn’t the ace we thought he once was (going to be). The longer Gallen was unsigned, the more likely it would be that he would end up in Arizona again. The QO was a no-brainer for me, so I think it is a good signing. Boras probably tried to pull a Montgomery here again, but thankfully the Diamondbacks didn’t fall for that one. I think there is still a lack of overall quality on this roster that will prevent us from becoming a serious wild card contender.\n\nJames: It’s fine. I don’t love it. I don’t hate it. Frankly, there are no better starting pitchers on the market at this point. Nor were there any better pitchers earlier in free agency that were coming for less money. With the team being up against the financial wall they are, I am actually a little bit surprised they took a gamble on bringing Gallen back. But then, they were desperate for another starter and this also helps the gutted bullpen. In that regard, this is a wise signing. Mike Hazen and his staff are mad if they think Soroka is going to be able to provide 120 IP out of the rotation. He might not even reach 80 IP.\n\n1AZfan1: Knee jerk reaction is this is good for the 2026 Diamondbacks. Given the state of the roster (especially the projected IL) and looking around the rest of the NL, the best chance to make the postseason would come through some exceptional individual performances by players well above their projection. Gallen isn’t likely to be a 3.50 ERA guy next year, but he’s got a better shot at it then anyone else available on the market.\n\nBen: This pairing always made sense. He’s functionally spent his entire career with the D-Backs and he’s clearly pretty comfortable with the franchise and the environment. That said, this is a floor-raising rather than a ceiling-raising move. Clearly, the rotation and roster are better with Gallen than without him, but it’s up to him and the coaching staff to try and fix the fact that his fastball went from one of the best to well-below average over the course of just a couple of years.\n\nWesley: I find it hilarious that he could and probably should have taken the qualifying offer and we’d be in the exact same position as we are right now.. Outside of that, it’s fine. Hopefully, Gallen didn’t spend the whole winter just appearing on podcasts, and actually spent some time sorting out whatever mechanical/mental issue that lead to his disaster of a 2025 season.\n\nDano: Kneejerk reaction was a booming “Meh,” with full echoes and reverb. Also, like Wesley, I appreciate the inherent hilarity of it. Beyond that, I expect him to pitch over the season much like he pitched in 2025–some good, some bad, truly mediocre performance for a wannabe “staff ace,” but serviceable enough for a third or fourth starter. Hence the “Meh.” In any event, he’ll likely be better than Soroka would have been taking the mound every fifth day, so that should be nice.\n\nSpencer: It’s perfectly fine. There’s upside and floor. The price is adequate in that 2020s Kendrick way. I’ve never understood why fans seem so focused on how he has a negative ego. Personally I’ve never seen that but I also watch from the east coast so I will be first in line to admit I often fall asleep by the third inning (10pm start time when wake up is at 4:15 is just not feasible). I’d rather have a starter with a chip on their shoulder than not if we’re talking mid range with ceiling.\n\nDBacksEurope: I don’t think there is a scenario where E-Rod, with $40MM left on his contract, isn’t starting for the Diamondbacks in 2026 as long as his ERA stays below 6.00. So, this is probably worse news for Soroka, who will only be here one year. Although he will probably start in long relief, he will see plenty of action with Pfaadt and E-Rod shitting the bed more often than not, providing a podium for him to perform, just like Nelson did last year. Then injuries will occur and he’ll get his starts.\n\nJames: I guess it depends on how one defines bad news. Soroka is the one being bumped from the rotation. Expecting him to have been an effective, 30-game starter was always a bit bonkers to begin with. If the team keeps the entire rotation healthy and does not spend a few weeks running a 6-man rotation until someone gets injured, then Soroka goes to the bullpen, where he can provide some heat in middle, low-leverage relief. When the inevitable E-Rod injury occurs, Soroka might get some starts. Or, if he is effective in relief (where he is better suited), they can leave him in the bullpen and bring up Drake.\n\n1AZfan1: Knee jerk reaction here is Soroka is the odd man out of the Opening Day rotation, but that is only provided that there are no injuries during Spring Training. It’s likely, or at least a coin flip’s chance, that one of the 6 possible starters will suffer some injury in Spring and the decision will be made for Torey on who will start the year in the rotation.\n\nBen: I tend to agree with the rest of the Roundtable: Soroka likely is the first one out of the rotation and bumped to a swingman/long-relief role where he’s had some success over the course of his career. Of course, it’s near-impossible that these six will be the same starters at the Trade Deadline let alone the end of the season and Soroka will almost certainly get a few chances to start if he stays healthy.\n\nWesley: Just to further echo what the others have already said, I’d say Soroka is the odd man out. I am much more comfortable with him as a BP arm or spot starter than I am as part of the starting rotation.\n\nDano: Soroka definitely, at least if Soroka really wants to reestablish himself as a starter. That said, it seems like he found a good deal of success pitching out of the bullpen, so it might wind up being better for him if he can firmly establish himself as a good long reliever/swingman.\n\nSpencer: Unfortunately I think Soroka will be pushed out of the rotation. Assuming ERod somehow stays healthy. But if the goal is to win games it should be the opposite. He’s 5 years younger and his overall production is closer to ERods than you might think if you only go off vibes rather than results. That’s not to say ERod hasn’t had the better career thus far, but if I’m going for ceiling and floor, I’m riding the potential of Soroka knowing he’s only good for 20 starts at most. That way ERod can try to remain healthier than average by only throwing a few pitches at a time. But I suspect the goal isn’t necessarily to win this season and therefore ERod will get the rotation spot and Soroka will be risked in the bullpen.",

    "description": "Collin Morikawa ended a 28-month winless streak, securing his seventh career Tour title at the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am with a dramatic birdie.",
    "fullText": "PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — Collin Morikawa birdied the 72nd hole to win the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am by one stroke over Min Woo Lee and Sepp Straka.\n\nHe ended a 28-month winless spell with his seventh career Tour title, shooting a 5-under 67 at Pebble Beach Golf Links and finished with a 72-hole aggregate of 22-under 266.\n\nMorikawa surged into contention on Saturday, hitting all 18 greens in regulation, pouring in 11 birdies and shooting 10-under 62. How good was Morikawa’s ball-striking? It was just the third time he hit all 18 greens in his career and he gained 6.472 strokes on the field in approach shots, the best Strokes Gained: Approach number of his career, the best in AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am history and the second best in the Shotlink era (dating to 2004).\n\nAfter a subpar Ryder Cup for Team USA, Morikawa started the season with a missed cut in Hawaii and a lackluster T-54 last week in Phoenix. That made nine straight starts dating to late June without a top-10 finish. But his swing coach, Rick Sessinghaus, gave him the pep talk he needed on Friday night and Morikawa put on a stripe show on the weekend.\n\n“He’s way more of a feel player than people realize. Everybody thinks he’s kind of a robot, and he is a robot so-to-speak,” Morikawa’s caddie Mark Urbanek said. “He just kind of got back to hitting shots and being a shot maker, and that’s what he does best.”\n\nOn a day when nine different golfers were within two strokes of the lead as the leaders headed to the back nine, Morikawa made four birdies and one bogey coming home, including birdies at three of the last four holes. But he made a bogey at 17 to drop back into a tie with Lee, who shot 65, at 20 under. Morikawa drove it in the fairway and had 235 yards to the green. Then he had to wait 20 minutes for Jacob Bridgeman to get a ruling, take a drop and wait for his ball to remain still in the wind long enough for him to putt out. Morikawa paced, stared at the beautiful backdrop that is Carmel Bay and sifted through potential baby names. “Not Bogey,” he later cracked.\n\nWaiting behind the 18th green to congratulate his friend was Russell Henley, who had chipped in at the Arnold Palmer Invitational 11 months ago to edge Morikawa by a stroke. Henley was confident that Morikawa would get the job done. “He’s got a 4-iron. That’s his club,” Henley said.\n\nAdded Straka, who eagled the last to tie for second and played alongside Morikawa in the final threesome: “He's one of the best iron players of our generation probably. He likes to cut it so it makes it even harder with that wind blowing 25, 30 off your left. Yeah, that is a pretty special shot to put it away there.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Collin Morikawa wins AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, ends winless streak",

    "fullText": "North Carolina opened its 2026 baseball season with a three-game sweep of Indiana that quickly turned into a showcase for both its revamped lineup and deep pitching staff.\n\nThe Tar Heels opened the season 3-0, while the Hoosiers fell to 0-3. With numerous first-time starters and key transfers, North Carolina used timely extra-base hits and strong pitching to control the series.\n\nHere’s what happened in all three games\n\nNorth Carolina opened its 2026 baseball season with a 9-4 win over Indiana at Boshamer Stadium.\n\nThe Tar Heels used three runs in the fifth and six in the sixth to break open a game that began as a pitchers’ duel, with both starters allowing only three hits combined. The win gives Carolina a 1-0 edge in the all-time series.\n\nRight-hander Jason DeCaro took care of business on the mound as he gave up two hits, no runs and struck out seven over five innings while the lineup, featuring eight first-time starters in Carolina blue, found its rhythm.\n\nTransfer Jake Schaffner drove in the season’s first run with a sacrifice fly before preseason All-America shortstop Gavin Gallaher ripped a two-run triple, the second triple of his career.\n\nWho else but @GallaherGavin to break this thing wide open?!?! \n\nTriple puts us up 3-0 😤 pic.twitter.com/s7Ga9j2uxD\n\n— Carolina Baseball (@DiamondHeels) February 13, 2026\n\nIndiana cut the deficit to two in the sixth, but UNC answered with six runs in the bottom half to put the game out of reach.\n\nFreshman Tyler Howe recorded his first career hit with an RBI double, followed by a two-run double from Colin Hynek and a triple by Schaffner to left-center.\n\nReliever Boston Flannery allowed one hit over 2 1/3 innings in his longest career outing for the Tar Heels.\n\nNorth Carolina won both games in its doubleheader sweep of Indiana, rolling to a 12-2, seven-inning run-rule win in Game 1 and walking off 4-3 in 11 innings in Game 2 at Boshamer Stadium on Saturday.\n\nThe Tar Heels extended their streak to 12 straight opening-weekend series wins, nine of them sweeps. It was the first time in program history that they recorded a run-rule and an extra-innings game in the same series.\n\nIn Game 1, an all-around dominant effort produced UNC’s first run-rule of the season.\n\nErik Paulsen had a fantastic day at the plate as he drove in the first run of the doubleheader in the first inning, then broke the game open with a three-run homer in the fifth — the Tar Heels’ first home run of 2026. He finished with five RBIs.\n\nFirst one of the year was a no doubter 🚀@Erik_Paulsen44 says hello and goodbye! pic.twitter.com/2UVdn9BxJw\n\n— Carolina Baseball (@DiamondHeels) February 14, 2026\n\nLeft-hander Folger Boaz allowed two hits and one run with six strikeouts over five innings.\n\nA six-run sixth, highlighted by a two-run triple from Colin Hynek and another triple from Jake Schaffner, put the game away. The Tar Heels totaled four triples over the first two games of the series, their most in back-to-back games since at least March 2015.\n\nGame 2 turned into a pitching and defense showcase. Ryan Lynch, officially joining the weekend rotation, settled after a first-inning run to work five innings with three hits, one run and six strikeouts.\n\nReliever Matthew Matthijs, back from Tommy John surgery suffered April 4, 2025, threw 2.1 innings, looked like his old self as he allowed one hit and struck out three.\n\nAn error behind him helped Indiana score twice, but North Carolina tied it in the ninth when second baseman Aiden Stewart misplayed a grounder, allowing two runs to score and sending the game to extra innings.\n\nBonus baseball at the Bosh 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/PywH6xay1u pic.twitter.com/uhmL5RrcQ3\n\n— Carolina Baseball (@DiamondHeels) February 14, 2026\n\nIn the 11th, catcher Macon Winslow launched a 398-foot line-drive homer off the scoreboard for UNC’s first opening-weekend walk-off since 2020.\n\nNorth Carolina hosts Richmond on Tuesday at 4 p.m. ET on ACCNX.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Baseball: Diamond Heels sweep Indiana to open 2026 campaign",

    "fullText": "News broke on Feb. 4 that Jeff Stoutland, the Philadelphia Eagles’ run game and offensive line coach, will not return to the team next season. The report from ESPN’s Tim McManus came as a complete shock to fans.\n\nStoutland has coached Philadelphia’s offensive line since 2013. During his tenure, he’s played a key role in developing one of the league’s best units. Jason Kelce, Jordan Mailata, and Mekhi Becton are just some of the players who greatly benefited from Soutland’s guidance.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Mailata, a current star for the Eagles’ offensive line, said he is “heartbroken” by the news. Additionally, veterans Lane Johnson and Landon Dickerson are reportedly contemplating retirement, which is likely tied to Stoutland’s departure.\n\nThis unexpected exit is shaking up Philadelphia’s offseason plans and has left fans with many questions.\n\nThe timing of Stoutland’s exit in relation to the hiring of new offensive coordinator Sean Mannion may not be a coincidence.\n\nNBC Sports’ Dave Zangaro noted how Mannion’s staff-building decisions this offseason could indicate a significant shift Philadelphia’s offensive identity for 2026.  Rumors are circulating that Mannion wants the reins of the offense entirely to himself. As he brings in several new coaches and staff members who share his vision, perhaps Stoutland saw the writing on the wall that changes are coming, and he wasn’t going to be a part of them.\n\nStoutland’s frustrations with Philadelphia’s operation date back to last season. He was reportedly irritated with the Eagles’ offense and his lack of contribution to the group towards the end of the year. In these reports, it’s said that head coach Nick Sirianni and former offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo had complete control over the offense in the final few games.\n\nCayden Steele at NJ.com wrote about how the divide late last season played a role in the separation. According to Steele, Stoutland was “not consulted” enough regarding changes in the run game.\n\nThat isn’t to say Stoutland was blameless. This season’s offensive line is one of the weakest he’s coached in his 13 years with the Eagles. However, a lot of that can be chalked up to injury. Johnson missed significant time, and Dickerson played through lingering injuries all year. Still, that doesn’t explain the regression from Mailata and Cam Jurgens.\n\nBut even in a down season, the Eagles’ offensive line still graded as the seventh-best in the NFL, per Pro Football Focus.\n\nMannion has instead brought in a slew of new offensive coaches. He is expected to incorporate a “west coast” type of offense, similar to that of Sean McVay or Kyle Shanahan.\n\nChris Kuper will be the new offensive line coach to replace Stoutland. Some of the other new faces include Josh Grizzard as the passing game coordinator, and Ryan Mahaffey as the Tight Ends Coach and running game coordinator.\n\nMannion has close connections to Mahaffey and Kuper already. Mahaffey coached with Mannion in Green Bay, and Kuper was a coach in Minnesota in 2023 while Mannion was still playing quarterback.\n\nThere’s been no indication of Jeff Stoutland’s next move yet. The term “leaving” indicates he may not be retiring, but he could instead try to coach elsewhere.\n\nSo what does this mean for Philadelphia’s offense? Well, big changes are still on the rise. With Dallas Goedert entering free agency and Dickerson still contemplating retirement, the Eagles’ offense could look much different than it has in recent history.\n\nFor now, however, it seems that Sean Mannion has the reins, and Sirianni is taking a step back in his offensive involvement. For better or for worse, the Mannion era is off to a polarizing start.\n\nThe post Jeff Stoutland’s Eagles Departure Signals Major Organizational Changes appeared first on The Lead.",

At 223 pounds, Brown would probably be a heavyweight.\n\nBrown has already initiated conversations with UFC CEO Dana White about potential opportunities in mixed martial arts, though he emphasized that any such move would come after his basketball career.\n\nBoston Celtics G/F Jaylen Brown says he would like to partake in the UFC or boxing post career 🤔\n\n\"Maybe post part of my career, I would love to partake in something like UFC or even boxing. I've talked to Dana White about some stuff\"#NBAAllStar26 pic.twitter.com/sBQTgICKZM\n\n— COMBAT SPORTS TODAY (@CSTodayNews) February 15, 2026\n\nBrown’s been all over the headlines this year, as his 2025-26 season has been a dominant display.\n\nThrough 49 games, Brown has averaged 29.3 points per game, ranking fourth league-wide, alongside 6.9 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.0 steals, and 0.4 blocks in 34.2 minutes. His shooting splits stand at 48.3% from the field, 34.8% from three, and 77.5% from the free-throw line.\n\nJB has been on a tear, scoring 20 or more points in 16 straight games. Earlier peaks included a 50-point explosion on January 3 and consistent double-digit rebounding outings. These career-high marks in scoring, rebounding, and assisting reflect his evolution into a more complete offensive force, helping Boston maintain a strong position heading into the All-Star break.\n\nNikola Jokic Talks Jaylen Brown’s MVP Candidacy",

    "description": "An enormous spinning hexagon in the clouds at Saturn’s north pole has fascinated observers since our first glimpse of it in the 1980s. The long-lived, symmetrical weather system – twice as wide as Earth – may have been spinning for centuries.",
    "fullText": "One of the most curious and captivating features on Saturn – an enormous spinning hexagon in the clouds at its north pole – has fascinated scientists and the public alike since our first glimpse of it in the 1980s.\n\nA trove of images and data from the Cassini probe that orbited Saturn from 2004-2017 provided some surprising answers, but not all of them, heightening the mystery even more.\n\nScientists first observed the six-sided jet stream when the two Voyager spacecraft passed by Saturn in 1980 and 1981. But their trajectories prevented the Voyagers from capturing the entire monstrous hexagon – twice as wide as Earth – in a single image from above. As they flew past, their viewing angle offered only tantalizing glimpses of its edge.\n\nMore than 20 years later, when Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004, the planet’s northern hemisphere was in winter and the hexagon was hidden in shadow. Because Saturn’s seasons last so much longer than those on Earth, scientists had to wait a few more years to see the hexagon in visible light.\n\nSo until then, they looked at it a different way.\n\nIn 2006 (still winter in Saturn’s north), Cassini’s team studied the hexagon using the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument on the spacecraft. VIMS could see the hexagon in the dark because it detects infrared wavelengths of light, basically heat generated in the warm interior of Saturn.\n\nSaturn is much farther from the Sun than Earth is, so its year – the time Saturn takes to complete one solar orbit – is about 29 Earth years. Consequently, each Saturnian season lasts more than seven Earth years.\n\nWhen Saturn approached its August 2009 equinox, spring – and sunlight – had arrived in the north and the wait was finally over. Cassini examined the hexagon with its main visible-light cameras, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). The ISS instrument had higher resolution than the VIMS instrument, and captured images in unprecedented detail.\n\nThose shots revealed a stunningly symmetric jet stream about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, with winds about 300 mph (500 kph). In addition, the hexagon spins around a tight vortex that marks Saturn’s north pole.\n\nThe hurricane-like vortex has an eye about 50 times larger than a typical Earth hurricane, and a maximum wind speed about double that of the strongest cyclones here.\n\n“This is the belly button of Saturn,” said VIMS scientist Kevin Baines, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Baines emphasized that, although it resembles a hurricane, Saturn’s north polar vortex is not the same thing because hurricanes on Earth feed on water and heat from Earth’s surface. “But it does have at least the structure of a hurricane, what we call the classic vortex.”\n\nThe hexagon itself, however, perplexed scientists. Baines called it “one of the biggest mysteries of the dynamics of Saturn.”\n\nThe hexagon has a diameter more than twice the width of Earth. Its  sides and angles are roughly symmetrical. For humans accustomed to weather on Earth, such an ordered, geometric pattern might seem curious, or even alien. Then again, maybe Earth is the oddball.\n\nOn Earth, jet streams slither and meander with no pattern or symmetry. Weather systems swirl and twirl throughout the globe. But while the atmospheres of both Saturn and Earth follow the same natural laws, different conditions produce different results.\n\nSunlight drives wind and weather patterns on Earth, and our planet is nearly 10 times closer to the Sun than Saturn is, which means we receive nearly 100 times more sunlight than Saturn. As the Earth spins, the energy it gets from the Sun varies more sharply from day to night than it does on Saturn. Earth’s surface is also non-uniform. We have water, land, ice, and snow, which heat and cool at different rates.\n\nEarth also has an extremely shallow atmosphere compared to Saturn’s, but with towering mountains reaching miles into the sky and disturbing atmospheric flow – the same way large stones in a shallow creek make the water churn and roll.\n\nIn short, Earth lacks the conditions for a jet stream to settle into a symmetric shape. But Saturn is a different story. The gas giant has no solid surface, and its composition is far more uniform.\n\nThere’s apparently nothing in Saturn’s atmosphere to keep a perfectly natural symmetric shape from forming. Scientists even duplicated the hexagon in a laboratory on Earth using a cylindrical tank of water on top of a slowly rotating table. They produced other shapes, too.\n\n“We can also get squares, octagons and other polygons – it depends on the speed and the different properties of the fluid,” Baines said.\n\nThat’s not to say scientists have Saturn’s hexagon all figured out. For some reason, Saturn has a hexagonal jet stream only in the north, not in the south. And while scientists have reproduced the hexagon in the lab, they don’t know why it’s so long-lived.\n\n“The hexagon is just a current of air, and weather features out there that share similarities to this are notoriously turbulent and unstable,” said Andrew Ingersoll, a Cassini imaging scientist from the California Institute of Technology. “A hurricane on Earth typically lasts a week, but this has been here for decades and, who knows, maybe centuries.”\n\nIn late 2012, Cassini began making swings over Saturn's poles, giving it the best views yet of the hexagon. The color-filter movie of the hexagon shown above was assembled from eight images Cassini captured over 10 hours on Dec.10, 2012.\n\n“The polar vortex at the hexagon's center – which was discovered by Cassini – is a bit of an enigma,” Baines said.\nThese highest-resolution views accentuated a wide variety of cloud structures within the hexagon. There’s the massive “hurricane” tightly centered on the north pole, and also numerous small vortices, appearing as reddish ovals. Some of those spin clockwise while the hexagon and hurricane spin counterclockwise. Some of those smaller features are swept along with the jet stream of the hexagon, as if on a racetrack. The biggest of these vortices, seen near the lower right corner of the hexagon and appearing whitish, spans about 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers), or about twice the size of the largest hurricane ever on Earth.\n\nAs Saturn’s year progressed, moving from spring toward the summer, the north pole heated up and Cassini showed the hexagon changing color. A bluish-green in 2013 turned to a yellowish haze by the planet’s summer solstice, on May 24, 2017. Solar radiation from the increasing sunlight was breaking apart methane molecules in the atmosphere, which then rearranged into hydrocarbon particles – akin to the formation of smog on Earth – and formed the yellow haze. Researchers found that small haze particles fill the inside of the hexagon, while larger particles dominate outside of it, with the inside and outside being separated by the jet stream that delineates the hexagon.\n\nAfter 20 years in space and 294 orbits around Saturn, Cassini exhausted its fuel supply. To avoid contaminating moons of Saturn that could have conditions suitable for life, Cassini’s mission team sent the probe on a daring final operation that would seal its fate. After a series of nearly two dozen nail-biting dives between the planet and the icy minefield of its rings, Cassini burned up in Saturn’s atmosphere on Sept. 15, 2017, returning science data to the very end.\n\nBefore Cassini’s Grand Finale, Baines was eager to see what further insights could come from the probe’s close-up views. “These last 22 orbits are giving us a unique chance to observe and analyze the hexagon in unprecedented detail,” he said.\n\nAnd researchers have continued poring over that data, long after Cassini’s end.\n\nGravity measurements made in Cassini's final orbits showed that the high winds at Saturn's cloud tops – up to 895 mph (1,440 kph) – persist far below, extending 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) toward the planet’s interior. Harvard researchers in 2020 used those findings to suggest that a deep supersonic jet stream is pinched on all sides by smaller cyclones and pushed upward, forming the hexagon.\n\nCassini project scientist Linda Spilker, of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said after the Grand Finale that she’s looking forward \"to seeing other new discoveries that remain to be found in the Cassini data.”\n\n“Even after Cassini’s 13 years in orbit around Saturn,” she said, “the mystery and extent of the hexagon continue to grow.”",

    "fullText": "The Phantom Corsair is a prototype automobile built in 1937.[4] It is a six-passenger 2-door sedan[1] that was designed by Rust Heinz of the H. J. Heinz family and Maurice Schwartz of the Bohman & Schwartz coachbuilding company in Pasadena, California.[5] Although sometimes dismissed as a failure because it never entered production, the Corsair is regarded as ahead of its time because of its futuristic features, and styling cues such as faired-in fenders and a low profile.[6]\n\nIt was shown to the local press in Pasadena in July 1937,[7] and first exhibited publicly at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on 15 February 1938,[8] with publicity including many construction details:\n\n“Streamlined to the ultimate—underneath as well as above—the body of the car covers wheels and eliminates necessity for fenders or running boards and thus makes possible a longer seat on which four people ride abreast. A rumble seat accommodates two passengers who face the rear…With a body of electrically welded aviation steel tubing - and an outer surface of alloy steel - and a passenger compartment lined with rubber composition, passengers ride in a scientifically safe ‘steel cage.’ Electric push buttons replace door handles, while the hood raises by an automatic trigger on the instrument panel, automatically switching on an engine service light. Seats are of solid cast rubber, eliminating seat springs. There is a ‘crash board,’ padded with cork and sponge rubber and covered with leather to minimize injury in case of accident. Layers of cork and rubber latex applied to the entire body of the car kill vibration and rumble at its source and eliminate all normal highway and engine noises. Indirect lighting features the car’s interior, while built-in headlights of enormous candlepower, with amber fog lights below, afford 180-degree highway illumination….The passenger section contains luxury compartments—one on either side of the rumble seat. There is an all-wave radio with twin speakers and an aviationtype aerial. Ceiling and sidewalls are lined with three-quarter inch light cork composition and layer of sponge rubber under upholstery of tufted design. The floor is acoustically treated with a layer of pulp composition, sprayed cork, rubber and floor carpet. Interior features are of dull finished chromium, and unprotruding. Air conditioning, which is additional, thermostatically controls cold and heat producing units.”[9]\n\nThe Phantom Corsair's steel-and-aluminum body measured just 57 in (140 cm) in height and incorporated fully skirted wheels and completely flush fenders while forgoing running boards.[10] The car also lacked door handles, as the doors were instead opened electrically using push-buttons located on the exterior and the instrument panel.[10][11] The instrument panel also featured a compass and altimeter, while a separate console above the windshield indicated when a door was ajar or if the car's lights or radio were turned on.[10] The Corsair's body was mated to the \"most advanced chassis available in the United States\" at that time, the Cord 810.[5] The Lycoming 80º V-8 engine-powered Cord chassis also featured front-wheel drive and an electrically operated four-speed pre-selector gearbox, as well as fully independent suspension and adjustable shock absorbers.[2][3][5][11][nb 1] Though these features from the Cord 810 chassis were all retained on the Phantom Corsair, the chassis was modified in order to accommodate the Corsair's large body.[5] The body measured an impressive 237 in (600 cm) long and 76.5 in (194 cm) wide, enough to accommodate four people in the front row, including one person to the left of the driver.[10][11] The back seats could only hold two passengers, however, in large part because of space limitations posed by on-board beverage cabinets.[10][11] Though weighing a hefty 4,600 lb (2,100 kg), the Phantom Corsair could achieve speeds of up to 115 mph (185 km/h) because of its modified, naturally aspirated 125 bhp Lycoming engine as well as its aerodynamic shape.[2][11]\n\nRust Heinz planned to put the Phantom Corsair, which cost approximately $24,000 to produce in 1938[11] (equivalent to about $370,000 in 2010), into limited production at an estimated selling price of $12,500.[5] However, Heinz's death in a car accident in July 1939 ended those plans, leaving the prototype Corsair as the only one ever built.[10]\n\nThe Phantom Corsair now resides in the National Automobile Museum (also known as The Harrah Collection) in Reno, Nevada.[5][10][11]",

    "fullText": "Cintel was a British digital cinema company founded in 1927 by John Logie Baird and based in Ware, Hertfordshire. The early company was called Cinema Television Ltd. Cinema Television was sold to J Arthur Rank Organization renamed Rank Cintel in 1958. It specialized in the design and manufacture of professional post-production equipment, for transcribing film into video or data formats. It was formerly part of the Rank Organisation.[1] Along with a line of telecines, Rank Cintel made 3 tube RGB color video projectors in the 1960s.\n\nTheir main products were based on either cathode ray tube (CRT) Flying-spot scanner or charge-coupled device (CCD) technology.\nITK founded in 1994, also made upgrade products include the TWiGi system, the SCAN’dAL and the Y-Front.[2][3][4]\n\nMany movies and TV shows for TV were transferred from film to TV on Cintel Telecines. Cintel saw reduced sales with the introduction of Spirit DataCine in 1996. The business was in administration until its announced liquidation. On 24 July 2012 Blackmagic Design acquired the assets of Cintel.[5]\n\nInnovation TK Ltd, ITK, was founded in 1994. In 2002 Cintel acquired Innovation TK, including the Millennium HD and Millennium Data Telecine.[8]",

    "description": "Because employees could do more, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees' to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.",
    "fullText": "The most seductive narrative in American work culture right now isn’t that AI will take your job. It’s that AI will save you from it.\n\nThat’s the version the industry has spent the last three years selling to millions of nervous people who are eager to buy it. Yes, some white-collar jobs will disappear. But for most other roles, the argument goes, AI is a force multiplier. You become a more capable, more indispensable lawyer, consultant, writer, coder, financial analyst — and so on. The tools work for you, you work less hard, everybody wins.\n\nBut a new study published in Harvard Business Review follows that premise to its actual conclusion, and what it finds there isn’t a productivity revolution. It finds companies are at risk of becoming burnout machines.\n\nAs part of what they describe as “in-progress research,” UC Berkeley researchers spent eight months inside a 200-person tech company watching what happened when workers genuinely embraced AI. What they found across more than 40 “in-depth” interviews was that nobody was pressured at this company. Nobody was told to hit new targets. People just started doing more because the tools made more feel doable. But because they could do these things, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees’ to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.\n\nAs one engineer told them, “You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less. But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”\n\nOver on the tech industry forum Hacker News, one commenter had the same reaction, writing, “I feel this. Since my team has jumped into an AI everything working style, expectations have tripled, stress has tripled and actual productivity has only gone up by maybe 10%. It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”\n\nIt’s fascinating and also alarming. The argument about AI and work has always stalled on the same question — are the gains real? But too few have stopped to ask what happens when they are.\n\nThe researchers’ new findings aren’t entirely novel. A separate trial last summer found experienced developers using AI tools took 19% longer on tasks while believing they were 20% faster. Around the same time, a National Bureau of Economic Research study tracking AI adoption across thousands of workplaces found that productivity gains amounted to just 3% in time savings, with no significant impact on earnings or hours worked in any occupation. Both studies have gotten picked apart.\n\nThis one may be harder to dismiss because it doesn’t challenge the premise that AI can augment what employees can do on their own. It confirms it, then shows where all that augmentation actually leads, which is “fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,” according to the researchers.\n\nThe industry bet that helping people do more would be the answer to everything, but it may turn out to be the beginning of a different problem entirely. The research is worth reading, here.",

    "description": "Disney sent ByteDance a cease-and-desist for using its characters on Seedance. When OpenAI's Sora did it, however, Disney struck a deal.",
    "fullText": "No, Disney did not release footage of a never-before-seen fight sequence between Marvel's Wolverine and Thanos (spoiler: Thanos won).\n\nThat clip, which amassed over 142,000 views on X over 48 hours, was created using Seedance 2.0, an AI video generation model that ByteDance debuted last week. The tool created a buzz on social media, where one user made a hyperrealistic AI video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting over Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nByteDance's decision to let users create content based on Disney's IP without permission isn't all that surprising given the AI industry's well-established strategy to \"ask for forgiveness, not permission.\"\n\nDisney, which is infamous for aggressively protecting its intellectual property, isn't having it — though how it responds to the threats is not always the same.\n\nOn Friday, the entertainment company sent ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns Seedance and TikTok, a cease-and-desist letter, a source familiar with the matter confirmed for Business Insider.\n\nIn the letter, Disney accused ByteDance of supplying Seedance 2.0 with \"a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art.\"\n\n\"Over Disney's well-publicized objections, ByteDance is hijacking Disney's characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters,\" the letter said.\n\nSeedance is only the latest AI company Disney says is ripping it off.\n\nDisney and NBCUniversal sued Midjourney, an AI image generator, in June last year. In the lawsuit, the companies compared Midjourney's tech to \"a virtual vending machine, generating endless unauthorized copies of Disney's and Universal's copyrighted works.\"\n\nThen Disney accused Character.AI of copyright infringement in a September cease-and-desist letter last September. In December, it sent one to Google in response to the AI image generator Nano Banana Pro and its other AI models, accusing the Big Tech giant of stealing its IP on a \"massive scale.\" Both companies have since removed Disney characters from their platforms.\n\nDisney is not anti-AI, however, and its strategy is not one-size-fits-all. The company took a much less adversarial approach with OpenAI, the world's leading AI startup.\n\nWhen OpenAI debuted Sora 2, an AI-powered text-to-video platform, in September, users began uploading IP-heavy content featuring Disney characters to social media. Instead of a cease-and-desist letter or legal action, though, Disney negotiated a deal.\n\nAlthough Disney hasn't shared plans to develop its own AI model or video generator, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company ultimately sees the tech not as a threat but as a new path to connect with audiences.\n\nDuring an earnings call late last year, he said AI would \"provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content, and to consume user-generated content, mostly short form, from others.\"",

    "description": "After helping her mom downsize, a parent explains why she's decluttering now to spare her kids the burden of managing her belongings later.",
    "fullText": "I've seen multiple articles lately about the boomer avalanche — all this stuff people have — and their kids not wanting it. I'm not a boomer, but at 46, I'm already aware that I have too much stuff.\n\nThree recent events made me think about the burden our possessions would place on our kids if something happened to us. So I started decluttering so they don't have to deal with my stuff.\n\nThe first event was helping my mom downsize.\n\nShe moved from a 2,000-square-foot townhome into a much smaller rental home. Doing a pre-move assessment, it was clear that all her stuff wouldn't fit in the new place.\n\nShe saw it as an opportunity and spent two months purging, donating, and selling items.\n\nWhen scoping out storage spots in her new home, my mom shared that she has a stack of boxes of stuff from her mom's house. She doesn't want it, but doesn't feel like she can get rid of it, and has been holding onto it since her mom passed over 10 years ago.\n\nMy kids made sure grandma didn't get rid of her little rocking chair. They both have memories of climbing on it at Grandma's house. It's now in our living room.\n\nDecorating our house for the holidays was the second event that confirmed we have too much stuff.\n\nEvery year, my husband goes into our crawl space and hauls out a full 19 boxes of holiday decor — trees, lights, ceramic villages, wrapping paper. Our house ends up covered with holidays.\n\nThis year, when decorating, I decided to downsize and packed a giant box with ornaments, tablecloths, mugs, and random decorations we haven't put up in years.\n\nDuring this process, I was reminded how important it is to check before donating. My husband noticed a few decorations from his mom in the \"donation box.\" We're keeping them. We may not display them, but there are memories in those figurines.\n\nI asked my kids what they wanted us to keep for them. Stockings, our Advent calendar, and the holiday village — each of them had items they associated with their holiday memories. These things will never go into the donation box.\n\nDuring our remodel last year — event three — my youngest and I learned how much the things we have sitting on a shelf can mean to someone else. My child's donation of stuffed animals made a huge difference to volunteers and children at a local soup kitchen.\n\nWe had a repeat experience this year, but this time with tablecloths. I have too many tablecloths. The last count was over 20. Even if I can't get laundry done for weeks, that is many more than we need. I challenged myself to get rid of half of them.\n\nA friend who volunteers at a shelter and soup kitchen happily took the donation. A few weeks later, we learned those tablecloths had a new life as blankets for a family of four who were living in their car at the time.\n\nRemodeling our house was the most eye-opening demonstration of how many things we have. Our storage space is still crammed with stuff that didn't make it back into the house after the remodel.\n\nFinding a place for everything during the renovation was a huge challenge. We quickly realized we couldn't fit 50% of our belongings (three bedrooms and my office) in the other 50% of our house.\n\nTaking up the most space — the items in my closet, which filled my entire soccer-mom-sized SUV.\n\nSo today, for every new thing I add, I donate at least two items. I've designated a section of my closet for things I haven't worn, and when the seasons change, anything in that section goes. And — the most fun — I invite friends to come \"shop\" in my closet.\n\nIn my office are multiple items that remind me of my grandma.\n\nOne of my favorite memories is being at her house, spending hours poring over her high school and college yearbooks.\n\nWhen it was clear the end was near for her, she had me take those yearbooks from the nursing home. She barely remembered who she was, but she remembered how much those books meant to me.\n\nSeeing those yearbooks evokes memories of her, keeping her alive in my mind. But they are my memories of her, not my kids'.\n\nAnd that's really the thing, isn't it? Wrapped up in all this stuff are memories and maybe a bit of guilt about getting rid of it.\n\nSo, I will keep cleaning out that closet, clearing out the storage unit, and reducing our holiday decor, but one day, my kids may have to get rid of those yearbooks.",

Musk, who has imbued his own chatbot, Grok, with a distinct personality, has 14 of them. Musk is known for promoting a brand of pronatalism that's become popular among Silicon Valley elites.\n\nAskell responded with her trademark dry intellectualism.\n\n\"I think it depends on how much you care about people in general vs. your own kin,\" Askell wrote. \"I do intend to have kids, but I still feel like I have a strong personal stake in the future because I care a lot about people thriving, even if they're not related to me.\"\n\n\"I think caring about your children can make you feel invested in the future in a new and very profound way, and I do understand people wanting to convey that,\" she added.\n\nThe responses to their short back-and-forth were as varied as you might expect on Musk's social media network.

    "description": "Browsing jobs in Phuket became Cheska Hull's guilty pleasure. When she called off her wedding, she decided it was time to move to Thailand.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cheska Hull, 40, a British reality TV star and PR professional who relocated to Phuket. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy move to Phuket was about choosing a fabulous place to live while continuing my freelance career.\n\nI feel like I've been part of the island's community for years. I'd visit annually for a couple of weeks at a time, maintain friendships, and get to know local business owners.\n\nEvery trip had me dreaming about potential jobs and interesting opportunities. I'm a PR specialist who has always worked in the luxury sector, across food, beverage, and hospitality. In London, I specialized in private members' clubs.\n\nThat work also led me into radio and television, where I starred in the reality show \"Made in Chelsea\" for nearly four years. It helped me understand the evolving world of influencers and celebrities. Having lived on both sides of the PR and fame spectrum, I gained a deep understanding of that industry.\n\nMy parents lived in Phuket in the 1980s, when my dad was head of Standard Chartered Bank for Phuket, which is why I was born here. We moved back to England when I was young.\n\nBeing born in Thailand didn't simplify moving back as an expat. I still had to go through all the same steps as everyone else.\n\nInitially, I came on a DTV digital nomad visa while freelancing for my UK clients. I told all of them, \"I want to live in Thailand. That's my dream.\"\n\nI wanted the best of both worlds.\n\nI've always been drawn to the famous Thai \"sabai sabai\" — take-it-easy — lifestyle. But when it comes to business, I'm driven. I could never just move to Phuket and not work.\n\nEven between projects, I was constantly networking, talking to people, and pushing for collaborations with brands I'd worked with before. Now, I get to do what I've always loved in a place I love.\n\nMy son was also at the right age for a big change. As a single mom, the stress came from knowing how significant the move was and wondering, \"Have I made the right decision?\" My main priority in life is his happiness.\n\nIf he hadn't been happy, I don't think we would have stayed. But he's 8, and he was able to fit in quickly — learning some Thai at school and thriving.\n\nThere was another catalyst, too. At the time, I was engaged to be married and realized that wasn't the path for me anymore. Once I called off the wedding, the door felt wide open.\n\nBrowsing jobs in Phuket started as a guilty pleasure. Through meeting people and networking, someone told me about a new opening at Anantara, a hotel I already knew well. It seemed perfect. And so now, as cluster director of public relations, I have a work permit.\n\nI've had to quickly learn Thai workplace customs, like addressing colleagues respectfully using \"khun\" before names or navigating the widespread use of nicknames. It's about understanding a different culture and being respectful within it.\n\nOne of my favorite rituals happens every Friday during my team's morning meeting. We go outside to a huge tree in front of the hotel with two spirit houses. We all take incense, make a prayer, and privately speak to the spirits. It's so different and unique, I find it special.\n\nIt's a meaningful part of their culture that I've come to love. I can't imagine trying to get everyone in London to do that, they'd laugh.\n\nThere haven't been many hard parts to settling in. The main challenge of living on a small, seasonal island like Phuket is traffic. You get used to a calm pace, and then suddenly there's a massive influx of people. But that comes with the territory in hospitality and tourism, which is ultimately what we want here.\n\nMy move to Thailand is long-term. Looking back, there was an element of risk. I came with a bit of an \"Eat, Pray, Love\" vision. I knew I loved it here and wanted it to work, but I also told myself, \"If it doesn't, you can just go back.\"\n\nFor me, the quality of life, the people, the food, the weather — just about everything about Phuket — makes it a place I want to call home forever. Island life simply couldn't be better right now.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad? Contact the editor at akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI just scored a win in the AI talent wars.\n\nSam Altman said Sunday on X that Peter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, the viral AI agent powering the agent-only social network Moltbook, is joining OpenAI.\n\nAltman said Steinberger would build the \"next generation\" of personal AI agents at the company.\n\n\"He is a genius with a lot of amazing ideas about the future of very smart agents interacting with each other to do very useful things for people,\" Altman said about Steinberger. \"We expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings.\"\n\nAltman added that OpenClaw, which was for a brief moment in time known as Moltbot and then Clawdbot before Anthropic took notice, will live on as an open-source project supported by OpenAI.\n\n\"The future is going to be extremely multi-agent and it's important to us to support open source as part of that,\" he wrote.\n\nSteinberger, previously best known for founding the PDF processing company PSPDFKit, came out of retirement to launch OpenClaw in late 2025.\n\nHe is likely to bring a new perspective to OpenAI's race to develop artificial general intelligence. Steinberger said he believes AGI is best as a specialized form of intelligence rather than a generalized one.\n\n\"What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?\" Steinberger said on a Y Combinator podcast in February. \"As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialize even more.\"",

    "description": "The first Air Force jet designed specifically for US presidents, SAM 26000 carried every president from John F. Kennedy to Bill Clinton.",
    "fullText": "\"If history itself had wings, it would probably be this aircraft,\" Vice President Al Gore said of the SAM 26000 Air Force One plane upon its retirement in 1998.\n\nThe first Air Force jet designed and built specifically for US presidents, SAM 26000 (pronounced two six thousand) carried eight presidents between 1962 and 1998 — every leader from John F. Kennedy to Bill Clinton.\n\nAfter 13,000 flying hours over 36 years of service, the plane was retired to the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, where it remains on display.\n\nI visited the museum in August and walked through the historic aircraft. Take a look inside.\n\nThe Boeing VC-137C was a customized and modified version of a civilian 707-320B airliner. It was powered by four Pratt & Whitney TF33 engines, each with 18,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nThe first lady also added the words \"United States of America\" to the aircraft to signal its importance as the president's plane.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president aboard the plane hours after Kennedy was pronounced dead.\n\nAdmission to the National Museum of the US Air Force is free.\n\nSAM 26000 is located in the museum's William E. Boeing Presidential Gallery, which includes other presidential planes such as the Douglas VC-54C, the first presidential aircraft, which was known as the \"Sacred Cow.\"\n\nThe crew consisted of a pilot, copilot, navigator, and flight engineer. The navigator and flight engineer roles were eventually replaced by GPS and computerized technology on later Air Force One planes.\n\nA plaque above the phones read, \"This telephone is subject to monitoring at all times. Use of this telephone constitutes consent to monitoring.\"\n\nThe closet also had a rack to hang suits and coats.\n\nThe secure communication center allowed presidents to place calls anywhere in the world while in flight.\n\nThe galley included a stovetop, oven, and sink.\n\nThe aircraft could hold up to 40 passengers.\n\nThe seating area, like many areas of the plane, is now protected by plastic barricades.\n\nStationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, the 89th Airlift Wing is tasked with flying the president and high-ranking government officials. The group is also referred to as \"SAM FOX,\" which stands for \"Special Air Missions Foreign.\"\n\nThe benches in the hallway were hollow to offer additional storage.\n\nIn 1969, Nixon redesigned Air Force One and moved the presidential quarters over the wings, which was the quietest and smoothest part of the plane during flight.\n\nPresidents used the white phone to communicate with crew members and other passengers on the plane, while the beige phone could be used to call anywhere in the world.\n\nThe room was furnished with throne chairs, a folding table, and another TV.\n\nPresidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter sat here while flying to attend Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat's funeral in 1981.\n\nPresidents used the electric typewriter to write and edit speeches while on board the plane.\n\nThe wall of the office space was decorated with a map of the United States.\n\nKennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, while visiting Dallas. He was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital at 1 p.m., and Johnson took the oath of office at 2:38 p.m.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's pink suit was still smeared with blood when Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes administered the oath of office on Air Force One. Johnson's wife, Lady Bird Johnson, stood to his right.\n\nEven blocked off by plastic barricades, the plane's cabin preserves a pivotal moment in US history.\n\nThe Secret Service had to break the handles off the casket to make it fit through the plane door.\n\nThe seating area featured six seats, a phone, and a folding table.\n\nAccording to US Flag Code, an American flag decal must always be positioned so that the stars face forward.\n\nLike many modes of presidential transportation, such as the bulletproof limousine known as \"The Beast\" and the Marine One helicopter, Air Force One is about more than simply getting the president from point A to point B. It symbolizes the power of the United States and its elected leader wherever it goes.\n\nThe image projected by presidential planes remains of great interest to President Donald Trump, who opted to accept a luxurious Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family instead of waiting for Boeing to deliver its long-delayed new Air Force One jets.",

    "title": "They moved to China for a new adventure. Their 3 kids gained independence — and mom has time for hobbies.",
    "description": "Elisa Orsi and David Sleight moved to China with their kids and were surprised to see how clean, modern, and convenient everything was.",
    "fullText": "After five years in Qatar, Elisa Orsi and her husband, David Sleight, knew they were ready to leave the desert behind.\n\nThey had moved from Australia to the Middle Eastern country in 2019 with their three kids — all under 6 — after Sleight accepted a job there.\n\nAlready big travelers before they had kids, the couple used school holidays to see the world after starting a family, before later leveraging Sleight's teaching career to travel even more.\n\n\"Usually when people have children, it deters them from travel, but we went completely the other way,\" Orsi, 37, a stay-at-home mom, told Business Insider.\n\nLife in Qatar felt safe and comfortable, and it served as a base from which they could explore the region, traveling to places like Jordan, Turkey, and Egypt.\n\nGradually, the couple found themselves looking for something new.\n\n\"By the time we came back from our summer holiday in 2024, we said, 'OK, we're done. We need a change,'\" Orsi said.\n\nIn August 2024, the family packed up their bags and moved to Hangzhou, a bustling city in eastern China.\n\nChina had been on their radar for a long time, though neither of them had visited before.\n\nIt wasn't until Sleight came across an online job ad for a teaching role in Hangzhou that they began looking into the city.\n\n\"I was impressed with the natural beauty and how modern the city appeared. I knew China was very well connected by the railway infrastructure, so I wasn't overly concerned about the location,\" Sleight, 45, told Business Insider.\n\nThe couple looped their kids, who are now 11, 9, and 7, into the conversation about moving to China early. \"We wanted to give them lots of time to process and to get an understanding of what was happening,\" she said.\n\n\"We have a philosophy that we talk to our children, and we keep them informed about the decisions we make,\" Orsi said.\n\nTo ease the transition, they showed their kids YouTube videos about China and the school they would attend.\n\nWhen they arrived in Hangzhou, Orsi said their first impressions quickly put any lingering nerves at ease.\n\n\"We were actually quite shocked to see how clean, how modern, how organized, and how convenient everything is,\" Orsi said. \"Sometimes you watch videos, but unless you're actually in it, you can't really understand it to that degree until it affects your life.\"\n\nTheir children attend an international school, and Sleight teaches English in the school's bilingual program.\n\nHouse-hunting was a breeze because the school put them in contact with a real-estate agent ahead of their move.\n\n\"We wanted to have a bedroom for each of the kids, and we were looking for amenities,\" she said. \"Most importantly, we wanted to be close to the school.\"\n\nWithin 10 days of arriving in China, the family moved into a four-bedroom apartment. It's about a five-minute drive from the school and roughly 50 minutes outside the city center, in a neighborhood dominated by local Chinese families.\n\nRent is 5,500 Chinese yuan, or about $790 a month, and is covered by the school as part of Sleight's employment contract.\n\nEven with a growing foreign community, the transition isn't always easy.\n\n\"During staff meetings and presentations, I wear an earpiece and listen to a live translation provided by the school's professional translator,\" he said. Sleight added that parents and staff also communicate through a messaging app with built-in translation.\n\n\"If anything were to go wrong, the issue would be resolved very, very quickly. So the children, they can be outside on their own,\" Orsi said. She added that she probably wouldn't feel comfortable giving her kids the same level of freedom even in Townsville, a city in North Queensland, where they lived before moving to Qatar.\n\nIt's also common to see children wearing kid-friendly smartwatches, which let them be more independent.\n\n\"You can see their location, they can call you, they can pay for things, and so they can go anywhere. They'll organize their own play dates and go and meet their friends,\" she said.\n\nAs a woman, Orsi also feels safe walking alone, including from the train station late at night. \"I have not thought about it twice. I wouldn't do it in Australia. And I wouldn't do it in Argentina, where I'm from,\" she said. Orsi moved to Australia in her teens and later met Sleight while working at a telecommunications company.\n\nIt took a year, but Orsi says the family finally feels settled in their new home. Most of their social circle has grown out of the school community, including other parents and foreign teachers.\n\nThe longer school days have also given Orsi more time for herself. She said she's picked up new hobbies, including learning to play the piano, going to the gym, and focusing on content creation for their YouTube channel, where she and Sleight document their family life in China.\n\nSleight is on a three-year contract at the school. As for what comes next, Orsi said the family hasn't made any firm decisions.\n\n\"I think we would probably like to move elsewhere and go to another country when our contract is up, but that could change,\" she said. \"We may very well decide to stay in China and move to another school or experience a different city.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city?

    "description": "Donegal are clear at the top of Division One but Armagh fall to defeat against Roscommon; Tyrone defeat Cavan while Fermanagh and Antrim fall to defeats.",
    "fullText": "Donegal maintained their perfect record in Division One, making it three wins from three with a comfortable 1-19 to 0-14 win over Mayo at a sold-out O'Donnell Park.\n\nA second half Armagh rally was not enough as they slipped to a second straight defeat in Division One, going down 3-18 to 0-24 to Roscommon in Dr Hyde Park.\n\nTyrone banked their first win in Division Two as Malachy O'Rourke's side impressed in a 2-23 to 1-14 win over Cavan, who are joint bottom of the table with Offaly.\n\nIn Division Three, Fermanagh are adrift at the bottom as their 2-18 to 0-18 defeat by Clare at Brewster Park leaves Declan Bonner's side without anything to show after three games.\n\nIt's the same story for Antrim in Division Four as Mark Doran's side are without anything to show from their three games with Longford powering to a 1-27 to 1-14 win in Portglenone.\n\nIt took nine minutes for the first score of the game to arrive in Letterkenny.\n\nAfter a cagey start, two efforts apiece from Conor McCahill and Oisin Gallen saw Donegal race into an early lead.\n\nRyan O'Donoghue finally got Mayo off the mark on 16 minutes with a two-point free, but it would take 27 minutes for the Connacht men to register a score from play.\n\nGallen landed five points of his own throughout the half as Donegal went in leading 0-11 to 0-5 at the break.\n\nMayo had chances to reduce the arrears early in the second half but Darragh Beirne, Conor Loftus and Ryan O'Donoghue all had goal chances well saved by Gavin Mulreaney.\n\nRyan McHugh floated over a superb two pointer to re-establish Donegal's six-point advantage before Paedar Mogan set up Conor O'Donnell to punch to the back of the net.\n\nMcCahill and Finbarr Roarty added scores to give Donegal a 1-16 to 0-8 lead midway through the second half.\n\nAndy Moran's side replied with three scores in a row before Beirne was once again denied a sure goal as Mulreaney made a brave save from close range.\n\nLate scores from McCahill and O'Donnell sealed a comfortable win for Jim McGuinness' side ahead of their trip to take on Armagh next weekend.\n\nA disallowed goal in the second half from Armagh's Ross McQuillan ultimately proved fatal, but Roscommon's platform for victory was built in the first half.\n\nA two-pointer from Diarmuid Murtagh in the opening minute set the tone as after Oisin O'Neill opened Armagh's account at the other end, the Roscommon captain was put through for a third-minute goal.\n\nIt would get better for the hosts as Blaine Hughes' subsequent kick-out went awry and Enda Smith was put in to thump home.\n\nThe sides traded a pair of scores before Murtagh kicked another two-pointer, while the crossbar denied Dylan Ruane a third goal for the hosts.\n\nStill, they pushed further clear with a Daire Cregg free and a third Murtagh two-pointer - this time from a free - before Armagh briefly rallied with points from Cian McConville and Ross McQuillan.\n\nHowever, a two-pointer from Cregg and a further two scores extended the gap to 14 before Armagh enjoyed a decent spell with three points, but a Cregg free on the stroke of half-time left Roscommon with a commanding 2-14 to 0-8 advantage.\n\nSmith extended the gap straight after the break, but Armagh roared back with the next six points, including back-to-back two-pointers from Oisin O'Neill.\n\nThe Orchardmen thought they were right back in it in the 47th minute when McQuillan crashed home, but the goal was ruled out as his side had left less than four players in their own half and instead of a four-point gap, it was eight with Murtagh tapping over a free in front of the posts.\n\nThis four-point swing was ultimately crucial but so too was Roscommon's third goal in the 61st minute.\n\nWith just six between them, substitutes combined as Jack Duggan sent a ball inside for Paul Carey to palm home, but Armagh were not done and two-pointers from O'Neill and McConville either side of a Tomas McCormack point brought them to within four.\n\nThey had a big goal chance with minutes to play when Jason Duffy fed inside to McConville, but he could only divert into the arms of Aaron Brady.\n\nArmagh kept pressing, but a Greg McCabe shot whistled over at the death as they slipped to defeat with Roscommon making it back-to-back wins over Ulster opposition.\n\nDarragh Canavan struck nine points a man of the match display as Tyrone secured their first win of the campaign with a commanding victory over Cavan.\n\nThe Red Hands recovered from a shaky start to take over in the second period and with 12 different scorers, they will be happy with their day's work against Dermot McCabe's men, who are still without a point on the board.\n\nCavan enjoyed a good start as, after Eoin McElholm kicked the first of his four points for Tyrone, Oisin Brady nailed a two-point free for the Breffni men, who then had a goal as Tiernan Madden finished from close range.\n\nHowever, Tyrone responded well with the nest three scores and although Peter Corrigan and Gerard Smith hit back, the game was level in the 17th minute as Brian Kennedy took a pass from Seanie O'Donnell and lashed home.\n\nIt remained even heading to the break but Tyrone finished strong with Kennedy turning provider for Mattie Donnelly to hit Tyrone's second goal and a Canavan point straight after opened a 2-8 to 1-7 lead at the break.\n\nCavan introduced Paddy Lynch at the break and he carried most of the fight in the second period with five points, but his side could not gain any real momentum as Tyrone began to pull away.\n\nA two-pointer from Canavan seemed to kick the Red Hands' surge with Cavan goalkeeper Liam Brady called into action on a couple of occasions, tipping a McElholm shot over and then saving from O'Donnell with Ben Cullen fisting over the rebound.\n\nThe scores continued to flow for the hosts, who outscored their Ulster rivals by 11 points to three in the final quarter as they breathed life into their campaign with Cavan, who lost Brady to a black card in the dying moments, now in a relegation battle.\n\nGoals from Aaron Griffin and Daniel Walsh were the difference in Clare's victory in Enniskillen as Fermanagh prop up Division Three.\n\nIt was an even start to the game with a Ciaran O'Hanlon two-pointer helping Fermangh into a narrow lead before they were hit for the first of the Clare goals as they coughed up possession and Eoin Cleary found Griffin to fire home after 12 minutes.\n\nA two-point free from Garvan Jones following a point by Clare's Mark McInerney, as Fermanagh pushed on with a two-pointer by Darragh McGurn helping them into the lead, but Cleary found a two-pointer of his own as Clare led 1-10 to 0-10 at the break.\n\nFermanagh made a flying start to the second period with the first five scores, but Clare rallied and led by three with McInerney and Cleary to the fore.\n\nThe hosts brought it back to one through Ronan McCaffrey and Josh Largo Ellis, but they failed to recover from Walsh's goal in the 60th minute as Clare secured their first win to leave Fermanagh in trouble at the bottom.\n\nIt was another day to forget for Antrim, who were soundly beaten by Longford in Portglenone.\n\nThe Saffrons opened well with Adam Loughran on target, but the visitors took command with Oran Kenny and Matthew Carey proving a thorn in the side of Mark Doran's men.\n\nLongford were six to the good when Loughran found the net for Antrim in the 21st minute, but it failed to ignite their challenge as the long-range ability of Kenny, Carey and Dessie Reynolds helped the Leinster side into a 0-19 to 1-4 lead at the break.\n\nAntrim did make a fight of it in the second half with Loughran, Niall Burns, Ryan McQuillan, Dominic McEnhill and Ryan Murray on target, but they were unable to assert real pressure on their visitors with Reynolds and Joseph Hagan keeping the board ticking before the issue was put beyond doubt with Carey striking home a 61st-minute penalty.\n\nLate two-pointers from Antrim's Pat Shivers served to add some respectability to the board, but the Saffrons find themselves bottom of Division Four on score difference from Waterford.",

    "description": "Gerard Deulofeu has not played for more than three years but believes he can make \"history\" by fighting for a \"miracle\" comeback.",
    "fullText": "The years have ticked by, three of them since he last kicked a ball, but every day spent grafting in the gym is one Gerard Deulofeu believes he is a step closer to a \"miracle\".\n\n\"One of the things I get energy from is that I know I can make history,\" says the 31-year-old, whose last appearance for Udinese was in January 2023.\n\nFootball is his passion, his job. It is the game that took him to Barcelona's famed La Masia academy as a child and European glory as an adult. To the FA Cup final and the unbridled pride of scoring for his country. Tying full-backs in knots from Milan to Merseyside.\n\nDeulofeu desperately wants to feel that rush again, to complete what he feels would be the longest recovery ever.\n\nBut there was a time, the hardest time in those more than 1,100 days since his injury, where he could not walk with his kids, take the dogs out, drive the car.\n\nWhat Deulofeu really missed then were the simple things.\n\n\"I lost all my personal life,\" he says. \"That's the most hurtful thing that you can feel.\n\n\"Now I am just waiting to do a miracle to be back playing football. But I know it is so difficult to come back with that type of incapacity.\"\n\nDeulofeu squeezes each hand into a fist and crunches his knuckles together to replicate his right knee. \"My two bones,\" he grimaces. \"They are shocking.\"\n\nThe former Spain winger had already spent two months recovering from what he did not realise was an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury sustained before Serie A broke up for the World Cup, when his short-lived return happened.\n\nAfter coming off the bench against Sampdoria some 37 months ago, he could feel the knee giving way and asked to be taken off.\n\n\"I played 15 minutes,\" says Deulofeu. \"And there, in that 15 minutes, the ACL was completely broken. That was my last game.\"\n\nHad it just been a case of fixing his ACL - and Deulofeu stresses that is a \"crazy\" injury in itself, but one from which most modern footballers recover - he would have been back representing I Bianconeri more than two years ago.\n\nIndeed, the winger successfully returned eight months after a previous ACL tear at Watford in 2020.\n\n\"You do the surgery and you change your ACL, your system, and you do a progressive recovery,\" he says. \"But the problem was the infection.\"\n\nThat infection ate away at the cartilage in his knee, each scan showing it progressively deteriorating, reducing Deulofeu to the feeling of bone on bone.\n\n\"I wasn't the luckiest person,\" he shrugs.\n\nHe has consulted fellow Spaniard Santi Cazorla, who was sidelined for 636 days after gangrene ravaged his Achilles tendon, and takes inspiration from the former Arsenal midfielder's comeback.\n\n\"It is an amazing example,\" says Deulofeu. \"To imagine how he suffered in these two years and a half, I can feel it now.\"\n\nDeulofeu's first step was to have cell treatment in an attempt to rebuild the cartilage, but he faced a setback after attempting to run again.\n\n\"My knee needed to heal,\" he explains. \"To train hard, first you have to heal.\"\n\nAlmost two years later, having continued with injections for his cell treatment, he believes he is close to trying to run once more.\n\nIt is a product of what Deulofeu says was six months of building \"muscle, muscle, muscle\" in the gym, working with a physio and fitness trainer for three to four hours every morning, five days a week at Udinese's Stadio Friuli.\n\n\"Let's see if I can accept impact,\" he says. \"I am so happy because I feel the leg is really strong. The more muscle you get, the less pain you have inside the knee, so now I feel that, yes, my knee is prepared to run.\n\n\"I am feeling that I am close. If we speak about muscle, I am in the same levels of the available guys now.\n\n\"But let's see how they respond, with no cartilage and no meniscus...\"\n\nDeulofeu admits there were times he felt like quitting, but he remains remarkably upbeat and focused on his goal of returning to professional football.\n\n\"There are three really important things,\" he explains. \"One, for sure, is family and home. To try to go ahead with this period, first of all your home has to be with peace and love every morning.\n\n\"Happiness, seeing your kids growing, with your wife, really good peace and love at home. That's really important to go to training every day with a good mood.\"\n\nOne positive Deulofeu takes from this period is that he can enjoy more time with his family than is afforded to most professional footballers.\n\n\"In those three years I am out of my work, my passion, I can see how good it is just being at home,\" he says.\n\n\"Just being with your family, with your kids, looking at them growing and being a father, because with football you lose a lot of good periods, good moments.\n\n\"There are a lot of games now in modern football, every three or four days you play, and your kids are growing so fast.\"\n\nHis three children, though, are also the main fuel for Deulofeu to want to play football again - he wants them to be able to share those memories with them.\n\n\"My big daughter is eight years old and she is playing football, and my son is five and also playing football,\" he explains. \"Now they are telling me: 'When are you going to get back? I want to go with you to the stadium!'\n\n\"That type of history with the kids, that gives me the power to continue and to fight for being there with them, enjoy that moment with them now they are older.\"\n\nThe second reason Deulofeu gives is his relationship with the club and the Pozzo family, who brought him to Watford and then Udinese.\n\nBoth parties agreed to end his contract when it became clear Deulofeu would be sidelined indefinitely, but Udinese have provided him with the facilities to continue his recovery.\n\nIn return, he is passionate about wanting to represent them again.\n\nFinally, he is a self-confessed fitness obsessive. Deulofeu can be seen studying the science behind his recovery while recuperating in oxygen machines or during rest periods.\n\n\"I am really interested in everything about health,\" he says. \"So I'm enjoying being healthy, you know?\n\n\"Being positive helps me to see life in other ways. I cannot think 'oh, it happens to me, I'm so unlucky'. OK, maybe yes, but I prefer to think in another way, my mind being clear and clean to go and suffer every morning - if not, you are completely out.\"\n\nHe spends his time at the club \"with a smile, with my team-mates, giving them advice\". He adds: \"Just enjoying my recovery, seeing my improvements, I can feel more positive.\"\n\nHe is grateful too this layoff has come towards the back end of his career. With 350 club games spanning the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, as well as four Spain caps, he has fulfilled a goal of which most only dream.\n\n\"Imagine if that type of injury happens when you are young? You are completely gone, your career,\" he says.\n\n\"So I am grateful to play this career with AC Milan, Barcelona, Everton, Sevilla... I won the Europa League, I play for my national team, I score. What can you demand more?\n\n\"Let's see now if I can continue my career or just be grateful to be part of 10, 12 years in that amazing sport.\"\n\nAfter the interview wraps up, Deulofeu has another hour and a half on the bike to complete, before switching back into father mode - the kids need picking up from school and his son has training in the evening.\n\nHe gets too nervous to watch Udinese in the stadiums at weekends, plus he must rest for another hard week of training, but loves witnessing his children playing football.\n\n\"Seriously, I am there for two hours because I am so proud,\" he beams. \"My kids' game is my game!\n\n\"Sometimes the coaches tell me 'come here to the pitch and lend them some advice'. It's funny, it's good. How to put the foot, how to pass. It is beautiful.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "description": "One word to remember: contagion.",
    "fullText": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can \nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nI am getting some friendly heat from all of you about a video I posted on X.com Friday before 6 a.m.\n\nWhat are Wall Street strategists saying about contagion risks?\n\nHow is market contagion spreading beyond software stocks?\n\nWhat is causing the software stock crash?\n\nHow might AI infrastructure spending affect markets?\n\nIt was actually live — I began rolling from inside Yahoo Finance HQ around 5:30 a.m. with a full stream of consciousness on the software stock crash. If you are up before 6 a.m. studying stocks and reading news, I promise to be doing more live moments like this in the weeks ahead.\n\nNow, some of you appear not to have liked that I called this a \"crash\" in software stocks. How else could you characterize it, I mean, really? I'm not being alarmist!\n\nWorkday (WDAY) is down 30% in a month despite zero indications that the company will go out of business in 2027 because of an Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) model update.\n\nSend me a different word to use, and I'll use it. And don't tell me it's a \"pullback.\"\n\nMeanwhile, others were hoping I would hop to the mic and offer up a shopping list of software stocks to buy. I am not going to do that because: 1) I no longer pick stocks, and 2) I don't believe the bottom in software stocks is in.\n\nAnd this brings me to my guiding light for today's Morning Brief: contagion.\n\nThe reason I'm worried about this new phase of the software stock crash is that it looks to be spreading to other areas of the market. We witnessed that during Thursday's brutal session for stocks.\n\nAnd Wall Street is beginning to take notice.\n\n\"Regardless of arguable ubiquity of AI application legitimately widening shakedown, the wider selloff in commodities/gold have hallmarks of cross-liquidation involving financial contagion risks,\" Mizuho strategist Vishnu Varathan said. \"Nonetheless, there are increasingly legitimate worries — involving with 'contagion' and froth in bull markets — associated with this 'correlation creep', whereby AI-driven sell-off cascade more indiscriminately.\"\n\nVarathan makes a great point, and it could be where market sentiment heads next. Think of the next dark cloud emerging in the sky coming to sit on top of your house. As this dark cloud rolls in, markets will adjust further.\n\nTo be sure, only time will tell if the massive software stock sell-offs are overdone. But this much we can say: It's an exciting time to be in tech as billions get spent to build out America's AI infrastructure. You just have to respect this hardcore trend and remember it won't be great news for every publicly traded company.",

    "description": "Interim manager Martin O'Neill says the current side's fighting spirit reminds him of his previous Celtic glory years after their comeback win in Kilmarnock.",
    "fullText": "When your manager is a club legend and he starts comparing you to the side that made him such, you know you must be doing something right.\n\nIt might just be a clever bit of psychology to do so, but if it helps Martin O'Neill lead Celtic to another Scottish title, he will have worked his magic again.\n\nWhatever words he used at half-time at Rugby Park, they were certainly clever considering the reigning champions came from two goals down to secure a 3-2 victory deep into stoppage time.\n\nWatch: Kilmarnock v Celtic - Sportscene highlights\n\nIt was the third time in a week that Celtic had rescued victory from the jaws of a damaging result.\n\nLast weekend, they looked to be exiting the Scottish Cup before Junior Adamu equalised in the 90th minute and Sebastian Tounekti scored the winner in extra time to secure a quarter-final place.\n\nOn Wednesday, they were seconds away from dropping a league point at home to bottom side Livingston, only for latest signing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to produce a dream debut winner, again in the 90th minute.\n\nThis time, Kilmarnock looked destined for what would have been a deserved point until Julian Araujo smashed their resistance with a stunning strike seven minutes into overtime.\n\nFor some, it would have been a reminder of the \"relentless\" nature of Ange Postecoglu's title-winning Celtic side.\n\nFor O'Neill, it brought back memories of his own glory days. Of the famous names like Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton and John Hartson who contributed to three league titles, three Scottish Cups, a League Cup and a journey to the Uefa Cup final.\n\n\"I managed, coached, a really top-quality side here 20-odd years ago who had loads of spirit, loads of resilience, loads of ability,\" the 73-year-old Northern Irishman told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"And these lads here are emulating that in many aspects and sometimes surpassing.\"\n\nLate goals are certainly becoming a bit of a habit for his current charges since he returned for a second spell as interim manager following the dismal short spell under Wilfried Nancy.\n\nCeltic have now scored six winning goals in the 90th minute or later in the Premiership this season, the most by any team in a single campaign since it was rebranded in 2013, surpassing the previous best by Rangers in 2016-17.\n\nIndeed, until Araujo's winner in Ayrshire, the Old Firm sides were sitting on eight goals apiece in the 90th minute or later in the Premiership this season.\n\nThe two Glasgow sides have had their problems this season, both sacking managers, with Heart of Midlothian having taken advantage to lead the table since September.\n\nChermiti hat-trick earns Rangers seismic win over leaders Hearts\n\nCeltic score 97th-minute winner to down Kilmarnock\n\nFormidable Motherwell carve out victory over Aberdeen\n\nHowever, it is the kind of spirit that has been gradually pegging back Derek McInnes' pacesetters as the traditional giants of Scottish football start to get their act together.\n\n\"The spirit the players has been absolutely fantastic,\" McNeill said.\n\n\"It was a wonderful second-half performance for us. Kilmarnock adapted to the conditions, the rain, the pitch, much better than we did and sometimes you just have to dig in - and that's exactly what we did.\"\n\nCeltic's board has been under pressure this season for their recruitment, both on the field and off it, but their latest moves appear to be bearing fruit.\n\nAdamu, the striker who arrived on loan from Freiburg last month, saved their blushes against Dundee and Tounekti, the summer arrival from Hammarby, secured cup progress before his opener inspired the comeback against Kilmarnock.\n\nRight-back match winner Araujo was another January arrival on loan from Bournemouth, while former England midfielder Oxlade-Chamberlain grabbed the midweek winner days after being plucked from half a season without a club.\n\nOf course, O'Neill's introduction of Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tounekti and another January arrival, Czech Republic striker Tomas Cvancara, at half-time also proved to be a managerial masterstroke.\n\nDespite the plaudits, O'Neill recognises that flaws remain.\n\n\"I thought we were very poor in the first half,\" he said. \"As a team defending, we weren't that good then we keep giving the ball away at times, but the second half was totally different.\n\n\"We made the changes at half time and then Seb scores a wonder goal for us and puts us right back in the game, culminating in us winning the match.\n\n\"But you can't keep doing that. We've got to put in the full 90 minutes.\"\n\nThe win at Rugby Park had former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner harking back to yet another era.\n\n\"They know now that this game is not 90 minutes - it's now now 96-97 minutes and they will keep going to the final whistle,\" he said.\n\n\"And that's the making of a championship-winning team. We did it in '87-88 and we won games when we were almost out of it and that's what it takes.\n\n\"You keep going. You might not play brilliantly in all of the games.\"\n\nFormer Kilmarnock goalkeeper Cammy Bell suggested \"small margins are going Celtic's way\" right now.\n\n\"They do not stop and you see the reaction of the players, the fans and the togetherness and the players will be in there on top of the world because that is a huge result for Celtic.\"\n\nWith Rangers producing a comeback of their own to beat Hearts 4-2 in the later kick-off at Ibrox, only three points separate the top three title contenders, with third-top Celtic having a game in hand.\n\nHow many more stoppage-time winners will be crucial to the destiny of the silverware?\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "If anything, Tottenham boss Martin Ho was a little disappointed by his side's 7-3 success at Aston Villa.\n\nHaving just watched his side comprehensively take apart the hosts for their second biggest Women's Super League win, he said: \"We probably could have had another five or six more.\"\n\nHo might well have been thinking they should have beaten their 8-0 record victory over Brighton back in October 2022.\n\nSpurs had 27 shots, 12 of them on target, in dismantling struggling Villa, who have now tasted defeat in four straight league games.\n\nVilla boss Natalia Arroyo admitted: \"They were ruthless and clinical in every action and didn't allow us to breathe for one second.\n\n\"It was like being thrown in a swimming pool and not allowed to get air - it was cruel. I am really sorry and disappointed.\"\n\nThe goal rush was started by Signe Gaupset's first Spurs goal on 10 minutes. Villa equalised but were only level for three minutes as Spurs grabbed two \n\nOriane Jean-Francois pulled another goal back for Villa in the 68th minute but just like in the first half, Tottenham responded quickly - just 12 seconds later - and three more followed to complete the rout.\n\n68 minutes 2-3: Oriane Jean-Francois scores for Villa.\n\n69 minutes 2-4: Cathinka Tandberg restores Tottenham's two-goal cushion.\n\n72 minutes 2-5: Maika Hamano stretches lead.\n\n80 minutes 3-5: Kirsty Hanson trims the deficit with her second of the afternoon.\n\n82 minutes 3-6: Substitute Tandberg scores her second goal with her third touch of the game.\n\n85 minutes 3-7: Julie Blakstad rounds off the 10-goal thriller at Villa Park.\n\nSpurs thrash Villa in 10-goal WSL thriller\n\nBefore becoming Tottenham manager in July last year, Ho was in charge of Norwegian side SK Brann.\n\nIn his first nine games, he got seven wins to help Brann finish fourth in the table.\n\nHe also created history in the Champions League, leading them to victory in all four of their qualifying matches to become the first Norwegian side to reach the group stage.\n\nHis Scandinavian connections are now bearing fruit at Spurs, with five from that region playing a part at Villa Park.\n\n\"We've been speaking about having more of a ruthless edge with the ball in front of goal because we are creating chances,\" said Ho afterwards.\n\n\"We had 27 shots - that's a lot. We probably could have had another five or six [goals] with the chances we created but when you score that many goals, it shows the belief in the team and the confidence through the group.\"\n\nNorway duo Blakstad and Gaupset each scored and provided an assist, while compatriot Tandberg came off the bench to score twice. Denmark winger Olivia Holdt also scored one and made one.\n\nThe 20-year-old Gaupset only joined Tottenham in January from Brann, while Blakstad, 24, signed from Hammarby four days later.\n\nAs for Tandberg, 21, and the 24-year-old Holdt, they came last summer and have also been instrumental in the side's efforts this season.\n\nTandberg is their top scorer in the league with six goals, and has two assists, and Holdt just one behind, but has provided three assists.\n\nThe exciting forward options has given fifth-placed Spurs hope of pushing for a Champions League place as they joined Arsenal on 29 points - five adrift of second-placed Manchester United, with Chelsea in third.\n\nEven if they miss out, there has been radical improvement under Ho.\n\nHaving finished second from bottom with 20 points last season, they are nine better off this time around with six games still left to play.\n\nAt the end of the 2022-23 season, Villa finished fifth on 37 points and there was talk of them going on to break into the top three.\n\nSince then, they have at least stabilised in mid-table, finishing seventh with 24 points and then sixth with 25 last term.\n\nCurrently however, Arroyo's side are ninth with 16 points from their 16 games - just seven above bottom club Leicester City, while fellow strugglers Liverpool and West Ham show signs of revival in the fight to stay up.\n\nVilla do have the league's second top scorer in Kirsty Hanson, whose nine goals are six fewer than Manchester City's Khadija Shaw.\n\nAt the back, however, things are starting to unravel, with 25 goals conceded in the past six league matches.\n\nThey have also shipped 12 in the final 15 minutes of the second half, more than any other team in the league this season.\n\nArroyo said: \"We don't want to lose a game, we don't want to concede seven goals and we need to do better.\n\n\"We will have a few weeks to work together and hopefully get fresh legs, more options and a deeper bench. I am proud of scoring three goals and will take some of the positives but we can't let teams score almost all of chances they have. See if we can close our house.\"\n\nVilla, who face leaders Manchester City next, need to arrest their slide to avoid getting sucked into the relegation battle.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "Former President Barack Obama spilled what he learned about extraterrestrial life when he was in the White House, saying aliens are \"real.\"",
    "fullText": "In his wide-ranging interview with progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen on Saturday, former President Barack Obama spilled what he learned about extraterrestrial life when he was in the White House.\n\n“I want to do a little bit of a lightning round, because it’s not often I’ll get access to a president of the United States,” Cohen said.\n\n“Come on, man,” Obama encouraged him.\n\n“So, couple questions here: Are aliens real?”\n\n“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in Area 51,” Obama said.\n\n“There’s no underground facility,” he continued, adding, “unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States.”\n\nCohen then asked, “What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president?”\n\n“Where are the aliens?” Obama said with a chuckle.\n\nObama didn’t let on exactly how he knew aliens were real, or whether it was just his own personal belief.\n\nThe subject of space aliens has gained traction in the years since Obama was president. Several congressional hearings have been held between 2022 and 2025 focusing on “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena“.\n\nIn 2023 NPR reported that during his testimony, Retired Maj. David Grusch — who went from being part of the Pentagon’s UAP Task Force to becoming a government whistleblower — told the House Oversight Committee’s national security subcommittee “that he had been denied access to some government UFO programs but that he knows the ‘exact locations’ of UAPs in U.S. possession.”\n\n“Grusch also alleged that the U.S. has retrieved ‘non-human’ biological matter from the pilots of the crafts,” the report said.\n\nAnd just last summer, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) told Joe Rogan that she has seen evidence of “interdimensional beings.”\n\nLuna serves as the head of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, a subcommittee under the House Oversight Committee. She told Rogan, “Based on the photos that I’ve seen, I’m very confident that there’s things out there that have not been created by mankind.”\n\nWatch the interview above with former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe post ‘They’re Real!’ Barack Obama Spills What He Learned About Aliens When He Was President first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "England wing Henry Arundell will face a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday after his red card in the 31-20 Six Nations defeat by Scotland.\n\nArundell was sin-binned for not releasing his opponent early on in the match and then received a second yellow for taking out Kyle Steyn in the air.\n\nThe Bath wing received an automatic 20-minute red card that meant his team-mates played with 14 men for a total of 30 minutes.\n\nThe 23-year-old has scored four tries in two games - a hat-trick against Wales and England's opening try at Murrayfield.\n\nArundell's decision-making was criticised by former England scrum-half Matt Dawson in his column for BBC Sport.\n\n\"Henry is a 23-year-old and will, of course, bounce back, but it was reckless and a poor decision,\" said Dawson.\n\n\"What if that had been a championship decider or a World Cup knockout game? You have to make good decisions under pressure.\"\n\nEngland head coach Steve Borthwick is already without injured wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso but has options for Saturday's match against Ireland should Arundell be banned.\n\nBorthwick could promote Elliot Daly or Cadan Murley into his starting XV at Allianz Stadium.\n\nAlternatively, he could move Tommy Freeman back to the wing and recall Ollie Lawrence at outside centre.\n\nEngland's humbling defeat at Murrayfield - which snapped a 12-match winning streak - was a blow to their hopes of a first Six Nations title since 2020. They are third in the standings with trips away to play Italy and France still to come.",

    "description": "Frustrated fans vote with their feet with more than 15,000 empty seats for Wales against France on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Wales played in front of their smallest Six Nations crowd in Cardiff as the crisis in the domestic game continues to turn off fans.\n\nJust 57,744 turned out to watch the latest record defeat, this time a 54-12 hammering by France at the Principality Stadium.\n\nIt meant there were more than 15,000 empty seats for what is traditionally one of the biggest events in the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) calendar.\n\nBut the uncertainty within the game in Wales appears to be taking a toll on the public appetite.\n\nWales head coach Steve Tandy said: \"We understand it's our job as a team to get the support here but the public have been amazingly supportive and understand where we are.\"\n\nIt was lower than the previous worst attendance of 58,349 against Italy in 2002 when Wales were in another losing streak.\n\nThe cost of a match-day experience in Cardiff has been suggested as the reason for some fans staying away.\n\nBut the political turmoil in the domestic game, with the WRU looking to cut one region while facing a potential vote of no confidence among member clubs, is leaving disgruntled fans to turn away.\n\nBefore Sunday's game, fans told BBC Sport the current crisis was \"heartbreaking, sad and depressing\" and many were no longer motivated to buy tickets.\n\nSwansea council leader Rob Stewart, who has previously spoken out against the Welsh Rugby Union's plans to potentially cut Ospreys, said fans were voting with their feet.\n\nHe said on social media: \"It's heart-breaking to see the Principality Stadium barely 3/4 full today. Much as we love our Wales team, fans are voting with their feet and staying away.\n\n\"Their message to the WRU is clear - we will stay away until you go away.\"\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nWales still rugby nation despite struggles - Tandy\n\nTens of thousands of Six Nations tickets still unsold amid Welsh rugby turmoil\n\nFans and clubs have openly criticised the WRU hierarchy, with board member John Manders saying some of the social media comments aimed at the governing body's bosses has \"crossed a line\".\n\nWales are also on a desperately poor run of form having lost 23 or their last 25 Test matches.\n\nFormer Wales international James Hook told the Scrum V podcast: \"Fans want to see a competitive game with a chance of Wales winning but at the moment we're got getting that. No-one is coming expecting Wales to win and that's a worry.\"\n\nHowever Wales head coach Tandy believes the team still has the support of the nation.\n\n\"We love the connection with our communities and nation. Even with limited numbers, when they get behind the team at the end, it does inspire the players,\" he said after Sunday's game.\n\n\"I understand there is lots going on and has been in Wales for a really long time, but we want to unify everything.\n\n\"We're a small nation, we need everything to be flowing in the right direction. I genuinely believe everyone needs to play their part in how we get there. There needs to be some patience to get change. It doesn't happen overnight. \"",

    "description": "Does 183 team changes in 14 ties devalue the FA Cup? Chief football writer Phil McNulty insists the cup retains its old magic.",
    "fullText": "The changing face of the FA Cup was graphically illustrated by the vast total of 183 team changes in the 14 fourth-round ties played over the weekend.\n\nMass alterations started as the preserve of Premier League clubs manipulating squads when priorities started to lie elsewhere, but they have now been joined by their lower-league counterparts.\n\nHull City made 10 changes for the 4-0 loss at home to Chelsea, while Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna made the same number for their defeat at Championship rivals Wrexham.\n\nThey are both in the Championship play-off places while Oxford United, fighting to stay in the division, made eight for their narrow home defeat to Premier League Sunderland.\n\nBlack Cats head coach Regis le Bris made six changes, but was vindicated as he can now contemplate a fifth-round tie.\n\nThe total works out at an average of a little more than 13 changes for each tie, so is the glamour and the much-cherished magic of the FA Cup being diluted by the lack of full-strength teams?\n\nOr does it actually even matter?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nBrilliant Mansfield pile pressure on Parker - is his time up at Burnley?\n\nTry asking Mansfield Town supporters if the FA Cup is a devalued commodity, after the side sitting 13th in League one took 3,500 supporters to Turf Moor and beat top-flight Burnley 2-1, despite manager Nigel Clough making six changes.\n\nTry asking the Burnley fans who reacted furiously at the final whistle whether it matters. Their pain was clear, the anger voluble.\n\nClarets manager Scott Parker, with Premier League survival as his target, made nine changes from a dramatic victory at Crystal Palace, only to see the decision backfire.\n\nParker may be able to play down the result should Burnley stay up, but it still represents another serious blot on his copybook. And will be remembered if they are relegated.\n\nThe FA Cup still retains its unique pulling power, whoever is on the teamsheet.\n\nA full house watched West Ham only scrape past League One strugglers Burton Albion after extra time, while Leeds United's victory on penalties over Birmingham City at St. Andrew's carried a real throwback feel to it.\n\nOne head coach who has clearly learned not to play fast and loose with the FA Cup is Liverpool's Arne Slot, who made a relatively conservative four changes from their win at Sunderland for a 3-0 fourth-round win against Brighton at Anfield.\n\nSlot was memorably stung at the same stage last season when he made 10 alterations for a tricky tie at then Championship side Plymouth Argyle.\n\nHe compounded his error by leaving the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah at home, Liverpool's shadow team losing 1-0 in a memorably raucous atmosphere at Home Park.\n\nIt was the object lesson that the FA Cup is not to be messed with, as it can still produce the moments that can make memories for a lifetime.\n\nThe most magical of all may yet await when sixth-tier Macclesfield face Brentford, seventh in the Premier League, on Monday as they try to repeat their sensational third-round win at home to Crystal Palace.\n\nThe atmosphere at Moss Rose will be red hot once more. This will be the archetypal FA Cup occasion. Brentford will have been warned by Crystal Palace's downfall, so their teamsheet will be of interest.\n\nIt has become a delicate, hazardous balancing act as the FA Cup represents a genuine chance for those clubs who have no hope of challenging for the Premier League – or success elsewhere.\n\nThere are many factors managers and clubs throughout the pyramid must weigh up, often involving serious financial consequences, which has unquestionably placed what is still regarded by many as the greatest cup competition in the world down their pecking order.\n\nThe FA Cup, come what may, will always retain a special place in the hearts and minds of the public, irrespective of how many team changes are made.\n\nThe pressure of games and preservation of players under physical strain also play into the thoughts of managers, with consequences for the cup.\n\nIt has not stopped the Premier League's heavyweights making their way into the last 16, with Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle United all now sensing that increased anticipation of a Wembley appearance.\n\nAnd as the FA Cup comes closer to the sharp end, it will be intriguing to measure the number of changes compared to earlier rounds.\n\nThis is a different competition from days gone by, but it still retains much of its old allure and results like Macclesfield's against Palace and Mansfield's unseating of Burnley will remain part of its glorious narrative.\n\nAnd that will never change, no matter the names on a teamsheet or those out on the pitch.\n\nEvery player, and every supporter, will still have that dream of an appearance in the FA Cup final at Wembley in their thoughts.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Team GB's men's curlers suffered their second defeat of the Winter Olympics but remain on course for a semi-final place, after they followed a victory over Germany with a nerve-shredding extra-end loss to Switzerland on Sunday.\n\nBruce Mouat's rink were edged out 6-5 by the Swiss in a high-grade repeat of last year's World Championship final, after a fuss-free 9-4 dismantling of the Germans earlier in the day.\n\nThe world champions have won four of their opening six matches, with another couple needed to guarantee a place in the last four and a shot at the medals high in the Dolomites in northern Italy.\n\n\"It was a great game,\" vice-skip Grant Hardie told BBC Sport. \"It could have gone either way but they took their chance in the end.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nThe Scottish quartet were in command throughout against the Germans, leading 5-2 at the break before accelerating clear, but the hitherto unbeaten Swiss proved more obdurate opposition.\n\nMouat's men led 3-2 at the break - a steal in the third proved the difference - and it took until the seventh end for either side to register a score greater than one.\n\nIt was the Swiss who did it, to lead 4-3, but it all came down to the last end.\n\nBritain needed one to tie, two to win. They had to settle for the former, meaning an extra end. But Switzerland had the hammer and they held their nerve to close out a statement victory.\n\n\"On another day we come away with the win,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's going to be tough to beat them but we know we are playing pretty well and it would be exciting to play them again.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Britain's women were unable to repeat their statement win over Canada against the Swedish rink who denied them European gold in November.\n\nThe unbeaten Swedes raced out to a 7-3 lead at the break - after twice scoring three with the hammer - and stole one in the sixth to take a stranglehold on the game.\n\nRebecca Morrison's rink kept fighting but ultimately fell to a 10-7 defeat to leave their semi-final hopes in the balance.\n\nAt least four wins will be required from their final five round-robin matches to have any hope of reaching the knockouts.\n\n\"It's really hard at this level - it's near-misses and we're a couple of centimetres away from making great shots,\" Morrison told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's frustrating but that's what happens at the Olympics. You need to be at your best and we just weren't quite there.\"\n\nThe women are back on the ice against Denmark (08:05 GMT) and Switzerland (18:05) on Monday, while the men face Norway (13:05).\n\nAnastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby safely progressed to the final round of the pairs figure skating after recording a season-best score.\n\nThe duo, who are the first British representatives in this Olympic event since 2014, endured a troubled build-up to the Games after Digby suffered a wrist injury which limited their ability to practice lifts.\n\nAnd in the team event at the start of the Games, Vaipan-Law suffered a fall during their throw triple Salchow, meaning there were worries about whether they would finish in the top 16 of the short program – needed to qualify for the free skate.\n\nBut they assuaged those doubts with a slick routine as Vaipan-Law landed the throw well before their final spin was synchronised perfectly.\n\nDigby was grinning even before their routine concluded, and was proven right as they scored 66.07, their highest score of the 2025-26 season.\n\n\"That little celebration at the end was me releasing all the emotion of it going exactly as I wanted it to,\" Vaipan-Law told the BBC.\n\nThey qualify in 13th place, meaning they will perform fourth in the free skate tomorrow – and will aim to better their best World Championship finish of 12th.\n\n\"Seeing so many British flags, that energy gave us a little extra,\" said Digby. \"We kept our heads and we were nice and calm. A clean skate, we couldn't ask for any more at the Olympics.\"\n\nGermany's Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin, who last year won world silver, lead at the half-way point with a score of 80.01.\n\nEuropean champions Anastasia Metelkina and Luka Berulava are second as they aim to win a first-ever Winter Olympic medal for Georgia, while Canada's Lia Pereira and Trennt Michaud are currently in bronze position.\n\nAdele Nicoll made history by becoming the first British woman to compete in the monobob at the Olympics and sits 13th at the halfway point at the Cortina sliding track.\n\nThe 29-year-old clocked a time of 2:00:83 over the two heats, 1.71 seconds off Germany's Laura Nolte in top spot.\n\nIt is unlikely Nicoll will trouble the medals but a top-10 finish would likely represent a successful Games for the Welsh slider, who was a travelling reserve for the Beijing 2022 Games but will also contest the two-woman event at Milan-Cortina.\n\n\"I was more nervous than maybe I'd realised for the first run and I felt a little bit like jelly on the block,\" she said.\n\n\"Seeing the Milan-Cortina Olympic rings was really surreal and emotional. These were all first experiences, I just wanted to do myself proud.\"\n\nNicoll is also a three-time British shot put champion and is targeting an appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Mica Moore, who represented Team GB four years ago but has since opted to compete for Jamaica, sits 15th on 2:00:98 before Monday's medal-deciding heats.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "An Olympic gold medal on snow has long seemed like the impossible for Team GB's winter athletes. One hundred and two years, to be exact.\n\nBut for those in the know, it has been just a matter of time.\n\nIn winning the mixed team snowboard cross title in Livigno on Sunday, Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale have written themselves into the history books, forever to be known as the first - yet it has been a very real prospect for a while.\n\nIn 2018, GB Snowsport set the lofty ambition of Great Britain becoming a top five snow sport nation by 2030.\n\nIt was a target set to build on the success of snowboarder Jenny Jones, Team GB's first medallist on snow with her 2014 bronze, and the same colour won by freestyle skier Izzy Atkin and snowboarder Billy Morgan four years later.\n\nBut it was also a target that raised eyebrows and smirks, and perhaps with four years to go, may still be a touch too ambitious - but the trajectory of progression is undeniable.\n\nIn Bankes - both individually and with Nightingale - Mia Brookes and Zoe Atkin, GB has world champions on snow. It has overall multiple Crystal Globe winners, X Games and World Cup gold medallists too.\n\n\"We've been saying we've got the talent, we've been showing the talent in World Championships and World Cups, but everybody looks to the Olympics because everything is amplified,\" GB Snowsport chief executive Vicky Gosling told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Here we are, actually producing that gold. For us, that is massive.\n\n\"We've said that anything is possible. We have amazing Brits with grit and amazing talent, it's all about unlocking that.\n\n\"People can truly see it's possible and we can deliver Olympic medals.\n\n\"Hopefully we are inspiring the next generation to get themselves to snow domes and get themselves prepared because the future is looking rosy.\"\n\nSpeaking after Sunday's gold, Nightingale said: \"What we've shown today, we are becoming a top snow sports nation and that's great for kids to see.\n\n\"We inspire kids to go on the slopes and go snowboarding or skiing or whatever it is, just try out winter sports.\n\n\"As a nation, if we get young kids into it, we can do very well.\"\n\nGB's Bankes & Nightingale win historic snowboard gold\n\nYes, it's right to say that the Milan-Cortina Games has not gone to plan for some British snow athletes so far.\n\nBut Olympic medal tables do not tell the full story, and are not the be-all and end-all.\n\nSnowboarder Brookes finished an agonising fourth in the big air - despite almost landing a never-before-seen trick in competition - and failed to qualify for the slopestyle final.\n\nYet despite not winning Olympic gold, silver or bronze as anticipated after her previous World Championship title and double X Games gold, she is a diamond on the British books and one of the biggest names in her sport.\n\nShe is just 19 and could well lead the British challenge at multiple Winter Olympics in the future - if she decides to continue down that avenue.\n\nThat's because Brookes is a snowboarder's snowboarder, a \"purist's dream\", who takes far more joy in shredding on a powder day than competing on the world stage.\n\nSo highly respected is she in her sport that every brand wants to work with her - BBC Sport understands it is just a case of name your price.\n\nNext year, her own line of Oakley goggles will hit the market. She already has her own Mia Brookes CAPiTA snowboard, and a boots line with Vans.\n\nIn Muir and Atkin, Great Britain also has two of the world's best freestyle skiers.\n\nLike Brookes, Muir missed out on an Olympic medal by the narrowest of margins, just 0.41 points separating her from bronze in the slopestyle, but she has another chance in the big air on Monday after qualifying fourth - with plenty still in her locker.\n\nAtkin, meanwhile, is the current halfpipe world champion and X Games gold medallist, and will get her campaign under way on 21 February.\n\nAway from the flagship park and pipe squad, Andrew Musgrave - competing at his fifth Olympics - finished sixth in the 10km interval start freestyle to post Britain's best finish in a Winter Olympic cross-country skiing event.\n\nThe Alpine skiing squad - Dave Ryding, Laurie Taylor and Billy Major - compete on Monday in the slalom.\n\nIn 2022, Ryding won Britain's first World Cup gold in the sport and will retire at the end of the season with seven podiums under his belt, while Taylor achieved a career-best fourth earlier in the season.\n\nWhat makes GB's snow athletes' achievements all the more remarkable is the limited budget on which the team operates.\n\nAs Gosling told BBC Sport before the Games got under way, \"we've punched way above our weight in terms of the deliverables\".\n\nUK Sport ploughed £7.2m into the ski and snowboard Olympic programme over the Milan-Cortina four-year cycle, more than any other winter sport but a mere fraction of the budget on what other nations are running.\n\nIt equates to £1.8m per year, a limited amount given the amount of global travel required for not just the athletes, but their coaches and support staff too, and so the governing body - which has just seven full-time members of staff at its London headquarters - has had to turn its hand to sourcing alternative funding through commercial revenue and sponsorship deals.\n\nThe sticking point for any GB success on snow has always been the lack of snowy mountains and freestyle courses, but that is not as convincing an argument as it once was.\n\nYes, many of Team GB's athletes have honed their crafts overseas - Bankes is Hemel Hempstead-born but grew up in the French Alps, while Nightingale hails from Bolton but moved to Austria with his parents.\n\nBut Jones and Morgan both learned on dry slopes in the UK. Looking at the current crop, Brookes grew up riding the rails at the indoor ski centre in Manchester, while Muir learned her craft in Aberdeen. Ryding raced on plastic in Lancashire until he was 21.\n\n\"We have over 60 facilities in the UK,\" said Gosling. \"We produce amazing talent and we have showed it time and time again over the past few years.\n\n\"Now it's about nurturing the talent and building the pathways needed and [putting] more emphasis and funding into it.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "SEATTLE - After periods of extended near-record warm temperatures and sunshine streaks in the Seattle area, there are some increased chances of snow heading into the workweek as more precipitation moves in and freezing temperatures stick around each weekday morning.\n\nFor President’s Day morning, the FOX 13 weather team forecasts a spotty rain-snow mix in the lowlands of western Washington. The chance for lower elevation snowflakes tomorrow is low for several reasons — including the fact that moisture won't arrive until after temperatures have risen a few degrees above freezing. The early part of the morning will probably be dry.\n\nOnce the rain arrives, if it falls heavily enough, it could locally cool the atmosphere to drag down snow levels to the surface. Even then, showers don't look very impressive. Accumulations are unlikely. If anything were to briefly stick early on, it would be isolated and mainly confined to patio furniture and grassy surfaces — and even that is a stretch. \n\nBottom line: this is not looking like a big deal. The early drive will be dry. By 9–11 a.m., wet roads could slow you down. Any wet snowflakes will transition over to plain rain into the afternoon, with highs on Monday in the mid-40s.\n\nArea ski resorts will see minor accumulations to its snowpack amid a challenging lack of snowfall for this winter season.\n\nFor the Cascade region, reports indicate there could be up to two feet of snow for the upcoming week, including at Washington ski resorts in need of snow this year.\n\nSnow levels will lower from around 3000' on Sunday all the way down to as low as 500' later in the week.  Some much-needed snow returns to the mountains Monday with additional chances during the week.\n\nAfter a dry Sunday, our weather will quickly become cool and showery during the week with chances of wet snowflakes mixed in each day.  Overnight lows will be frosty, near freezing every morning.\n\nHeading into February, the snow pack in Washington was only at about 40% of its average, with chances to make that up by the end of the season quickly dropping.\n\nCity of Seattle settles lawsuit over death of Jaahnavi Kandula\n\nSome gift cards sold at Costco are now worthless\n\nSeahawks Super Bowl parade: Video, highlights, more from downtown Seattle\n\nSemi full of candy crashes on Highway 18 in Covington\n\nCrowds climb, damage Seattle's historic pergola after Seahawks Super Bowl win\n\nTo get the best local news, weather and sports in Seattle for free, \n\nDownload the free FOX LOCAL app for mobile in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for live Seattle news, top stories, weather updates and more local and national news.",

    "fullText": "Bill Maher eviscerated President Donald Trump over the “biggest dick move in American history,” following the rolling back of climate change regulations.\n\nOn the Friday, February 13 episode of Real Time With Bill Maher, the late-night host, 70, took aim at the POTUS, 79, over his remarks — and recent actions — involving global warming.\n\n“Trump has always said it’s a hoax, the whole thing with climate change,” Maher explained. “He said, scientists, he says, are ‘stupid people.’ He says, the idea that greenhouse gases cause climate change, there’s no basis in fact.”\n\nThat’s when the stand-up comedian pointed out, “He thinks it’s just some bulls*** that people made up out of nothing to get rich. You know, like crypto.”\n\nOn February 12, the Trump administration rescinded a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declaration stating that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a danger to public health. The Associated Press reported that the repeal eliminates all greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and could result in a larger repeal of climate regulations on things like power plants and oil and gas facilities.\n\nOf the move, Maher said, “And, yes, his EPA director, Lee Zeldin, said this is the single, this is a quote, ‘single largest deregulatory action in American history.'”\n\nHe then bluntly declared, “Probably true. Also the biggest dick move in American history.”\n\nIn September 2025, Trump slammed the concept of climate change during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” the POTUS said, per PBS. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — A 15th-century statue that once stood outside Milan’s iconic Duomo has found a new home.\n\nThe Bearded Saint with Book was recently restored under the “Adopt a Statue” program, launched in 2020 by the centuries-old institution that oversees the cathedral’s conservation. As of Feb. 13, it is on display at Piazzale Cadorna, behind a glass window at the headquarters of FNM, a Lombardy-based transport company.\n\nThe program recruits donors — either companies or individuals — to fund restoration of a statue under a loan agreement that allows it to occasionally be displayed outside the Duomo.\n\n“The uniqueness of this project is that statues that would otherwise remain in our deposits are restored and brought back to their original beauty,” the program’s project manager, Elisa Mantia, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “In that way, they can continue to tell the story of the Duomo even in places that are far from the monument.”\n\nThese agreements are in some cases granted for an initial one-year term and may be renewed. The initiative follows previous fundraising campaigns in which donors could adopt gargoyles or spires in exchange for inclusion in the Duomo’s donor register, where contributors’ names are recorded as part of the cathedral’s long history of support.\n\nThe construction of the Duomo began in 1386, under the rule of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, then lord of Milan, in collaboration with the city’s archbishop. The cathedral was built on the site of two preexisting basilicas and its completion took more than five centuries. One of its bronze doors was not installed until 1965.\n\nBecause construction spanned centuries, the Duomo’s statues were carved by artists from different regions and periods, resulting in a monument that reads as a timeline of evolving artistic styles.\n\nThe Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, which oversees the cathedral’s conservation, has sought funding to restore statues removed over the centuries for maintenance or safety reasons.\n\n“Culture can save the world,” Andrea Gibelli, president of FNM, said during a press conference on Feb. 13 to mark the unveiling of Bearded Saint with Book. “We want to spread the cultural riches we are fortunate to have, which are often overlooked or not fully appreciated.\"\n\nOther sculptures adopted under the program by different sponsors have included a 16th-century David, a depiction of Samson and the Lion, and a statue of Saint Matthew the Apostle.\n\nWhile the number of adopted statues isn't disclosed and not all are displayed in public spaces, Mantia said that her institution has preselected around 30 sculptures as eligible for restoration. Each case must be authorized by Italy’s cultural heritage authorities, as the process involves a formal loan agreement subject to conservation, insurance and transport regulations.\n\n“We usually select them because they are very beautiful and not so damaged that they would be unsafe to loan,” Mantia said.\n\nOnce a donor reaches out, experts like Mantia accompany them to the Duomo’s storage facilities to choose a sculpture. After it is selected, restoration typically takes between one and three months.\n\nBearded Saint with a Book was originally displayed outdoors. Aside from a black crust from air pollution on its surface, it had no structural damages preventing its loan.\n\n“This often involves only surface finishing or an intervention with compresses or mechanical cleaning,” Mantia said.\n\nThe marble used for both the statues and the Duomo itself comes from the quarries of Candoglia in Italy’s Piedmont region. The same stone has been used since the late 14th century, under the supervision of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo.\n\n“Beyond being the symbol of Milan, the Duomo is also a symbol of its history,” Mantia said. “It is a monument that grew together with the city, that tells within itself, in its statues and in the style with which it is decorated, the entire history of the city.”",

    "fullText": "Hemant Virmani was laid off from Amazon during the October 2025 round of layoffs.\n\nHe's using this time to learn new AI skills while applying to engineering roles — and exercising.\n\nHis teenage daughter has inspired him to stay positive, keep his cool, and focus on the future.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hemant Virmani, a 47-year-old tech professional based in Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAmazon was part of my daily life for 11.5 years, and suddenly it was gone.\n\nThere's no right way or easy way to do layoffs. I watched my team members get laid off in 2023, and I know how difficult it is. Still, when I received an email in the middle of the night in October 2025 saying I'd been laid off from my senior software development manager position, I was shocked.\n\nWatching my teenage daughter navigate her own difficult situation taught me the biggest lesson in how to move forward well. Now I'm applying to jobs and working on upskilling in AI so I can be proactive, not reactive, to the tech industry.\n\nOnly time will tell if this layoff is a blessing in disguise, but for now, it has led to a refreshing change.\n\nI loved my time at Amazon, and I really feel as though it's a place for exceptional people. The number of quality brains in the office, throwing around ideas and solving a custom problem, was amazing.\n\nThe morning after my layoff, I had a mandated 30-minute meeting with my manager, and it actually went very well. We talked about the layoff, and he offered me support. He delivered it all to me in a very positive, human way, and it was really affirming.\n\nAn old manager also reached out to meet me at a local coffee shop the next day to spend time together and check in on my state of mind. I think he wanted to go about the layoffs right, which isn't easy to do.\n\nI felt attached to the layoff for the first few days; however, I knew there was no way to control what happened — I could only control how I reacted to it.\n\nMy daughter is a senior in high school, and she had an adverse situation happen to her last year that required recovery. How she reacted in that difficult time inspired me. Her mental model was: \"Challenges don't have to keep me from showing up for myself or for others.\" Her positive attitude was inspiration for me to do the same.\n\nI kind of learned from her that I had to take this layoff with positivity, keep my cool, and focus on what was next.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I lost my father and spent the next month in India supporting my family. I took about a month to settle my mind, reflect on what I wanted next for my career, and help my daughter finish her college essays.\n\nIt's been a very refreshing change to think about what I want next in my engineering career. I'm less focused on the size or name of the next company I work for, and more on what I'd be doing there. I'm looking forward to hopefully heading the engineering for something that has a great impact on customers. Right now, I don't think that can be done without AI, so I'm working on upskilling.\n\nI want to be proactive, not reactive, about the AI skills I'll need in the future. My team at Amazon used some AI tools, so I'm familiar with some, but I was only able to spend a fraction of my workday using them. Now, I'm building those skills myself.\n\nI started working on a hobby AI project a couple of weeks ago, to go hands-on with AI and be more grounded in the reality of what the AI landscape is like right now. It's been different, and a refreshing change, to build something myself rather than to study it, read about it, or work on a team developing it.\n\nWhen I had a job, it was easy for my first priority to be work. Now I'm making sure that my top priority is my health. I've been going to the gym four or five days a week, and I'm refining a health plan to follow even after I start working again.\n\nOnce I'm done at the gym, my time is a 50/50 split between learning AI and applying to jobs or networking. I'm applying for head of engineering roles where I'd own significant impactful initiatives, averaging 2-3 applications every week.\n\nI made a post on LinkedIn about my layoff, and I received so many supportive comments, texts, and calls from people — some I hadn't talked to in decades. Someone from college whom I hadn't talked to in over 25 years reached out, and it was so nice. It felt like we never disconnected. I've also had multiple job leads come from my post, which I'm following up on.\n\nAs of now, I have some worries about when I'll find my next job, but this time has given me the ability to work on things I wasn't able to before. I'm making sure I spend this time with a lot of positivity, not letting negative thoughts come around.\n\nMy advice to anyone undergoing layoffs is to realize that layoffs are not about you. It's about an environment that is driving layoffs. Secondly, now that this has happened, you can't go back in the past and change it. Look forward to what you can do next. How you react is very important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from Amazon? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "After a weekend of FA Cup action without VAR, BBC Sport ask managers, fans and pundits whether the game needs technology - and what needs to change.",
    "fullText": "Would football be better without the video assistant referee (VAR) system?\n\nPremier League fans, managers and players got a reminder of what life was like without VAR in the FA Cup fourth round - and it is fair to say this weekend was not without its problems.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, VAR has not been brought in until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nAfter a season full of controversy, delayed decisions and confusion fuelled by VAR, its very existence has been questioned at times, with many claiming the game would be better without it.\n\nIn fact, after a day full of long delays, mixed messages and irate managers in early February, ex-Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Match of the Day: \"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\"\n\nAfter a couple of offside goals being allowed, a blatant penalty not being awarded plus various other controversial decisions, the weekend certainly brought the subject back into the public eye.\n\nLong delays, irate managers and mixed messages - is VAR bad for game?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nWe have all heard the arguments against VAR.\n\nDecisions taking too long, celebrations being put on hold while deliberations take place, confusion as goals are given - or ruled out - for marginal reasons, denying referees the ability to use their own common sense.\n\nBut Newcastle's controversial 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday could hardly have gone better for supporters of VAR - or worse for those who argue football is better without it.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener was clearly offside, Villa's full-back Lucas Digne inexplicably escaped conceding a penalty for handball and the Frenchman could easily have been dismissed for a reckless challenge as well.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold, especially us today when we were on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery went further, saying \"VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees\".\n\nThere was also some controversy at Anfield during Liverpool's 3-0 win over Brighton.\n\nSubstitute Rio Ngumoha, 17, had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside for the hosts, while the Seagulls were furious Mohamed Salah was awarded a penalty.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"In general, I enjoy watching football without VAR because if you then score you're like 'it's a goal'.\n\n\"I like VAR only for the clear and obvious things - I'm not meaning a red card yes or no for Marc Guehi on Mo Salah because I thought it was.\n\n\"So let's stay away from that and only go to offside yes or no, ball over the line yes or no and, for the rest, the referee referees the game.\n\n\"I think we're now so used to VAR that I would prefer to have VAR during a game.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola was unsure whether football was better with VAR, despite seeing Omar Marmoush denied a goal for a debatable offside in his side's 3-0 win against Salford.\n\n\"Sometimes before I thought it was better and sometimes I think VAR helps us to have a more fair game,\" he said. \"To be honest I don't know.\"\n\nFor some though, it is simple - rather than VAR being a solution for wrong decisions, they would argue officials just need to get things right.\n\nWhen asked on Match of the Day Live whether the errors at Villa Park put him in favour of VAR, ex-Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, said: \"No. I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it?\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think Saturday is a great example of that.\n\n\"These guys look petrified to make a decision because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\n\n\"For me, [referees' decisions] are actually getting worse.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given added on Match of the Day: \"It shows you why we use VAR. A lot of decisions the officials got wrong at Villa Park. VAR is like a comfort blanket for referees.\n\n\"The decision is taken away from the officials. The linesman has been told all season not to put their flag up, so their brain has been trained. I think it shows VAR is a help even though we complain about it most weeks.\"\n\nWhen asked whether football had become too reliant on VAR, Howe had some sympathy with the argument.\n\n\"There is an argument to say yes,\" he said. \"Because when VAR is there, there is a tendency to think 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'.\n\n\"Then your decision making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there. I would probably say you are right in that respect.\"\n\nBut former referee Graham Scott feels it is unfair to claim officials hide behind VAR.\n\n\"I really don't think that's fair,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"Obviously I work with them closely and I know these guys and they're not like that. It's not how their minds work, not how their processes work.\n\n\"I spent half my career with VAR and half without it - the other way around of course, without it first.\n\n\"And then when I was in the Premier League I was still dropping into the Championship quite often. So you're in and out, in and out. And your processes essentially stay the same.\n\n\"What has changed though is with VAR you don't have that spell in a game where you know you've made a really big error and you now have to reset and go again.\"\n\nJames: Football without VAR is real football. Having gone to games for the last 30 years, the last few years have been terrible in comparison. I don't bother cheering goals any more as the officials are far more interested in finding ways of disallowing goals than the entertainment of the match-going fan.\n\nVAR will be the thing that makes me turn in my season ticket, and if West Ham do get relegated the lack of VAR will be a blessing.\n\nFrank: I supported the introduction of VAR, but it was great not having it today. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many VAR ridiculous errors.\n\nAlan: Much, much better [without]. VAR has ruined the game, thankfully I now support non-league football where there are humans, making human mistakes and getting it right.\n\nStephen: Much better without VAR. No waiting for obvious incidents that everyone can see immediately but takes VAR forever to decide. Time for return of refs and linesman to start refereeing the game again.\n\nMike: Better, even though City probably had a goal chalked off incorrectly. Right or wrong, its so much better to just know immediately if its a goal or not. VAR is a moment-killer.\n\nLes: The game is so much better without VAR. It flows without problem like it used to do. The officials are there to make decisions rightly or wrongly. VAR are always making wrong calls so I can't see the point of it. Offside because someone's toes are on the lines drawn is absolutely pathetic.\n\nBonnie: As a Villa and VAR fan, that is exactly the decision that VAR doesn't get credit for. VAR gets it right 100%\n\nRoger: That was so blatantly offside, have linesman lost their natural ability to spot stuff like this since the introduction of VAR? Whenever you see a defence hold their line like Newcastle did, strikers are more often than not offside. Poor decision.\n\nPeter: There's an easy fix for VAR offsides. If you can watch one TV replay and see the on-field decision is clearly wrong, you intervene.\n\nStephen: That's what you all wanted isn't it? More goals regardless of whether they're actually fair or not?\n\nLiga: It's these types of situations and these types of situation only where VAR should and needs to be used for offsides. Not those hairline millimetre is he on or off line drawing nonsense situations.\n\nCallum: This season is proving 2 things. 1) VAR is a must. 2) Brave, high pressure attacking football is dead.\n\nBen: What are linesman for exactly? Having no VAR is a another shambles, who makes these decisions?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "A Chicago teen who spoke out for her father’s release after he was detained last fall by immigration officials in a deportation case has died after battling a rare form of cancer.\n\nOfelia Giselle Torres Hidalgo, 16, died Friday from stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the family said in a statement. Funeral arrangements are private.\n\nThe teenager was diagnosed in December 2024 with the aggressive form of soft tissue cancer and had been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment.\n\nAn immigration judge in Chicago ruled three days before Ofelia’s death that her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was conditionally entitled to receive “cancellation of removal” due to the hardships his deportation would cause his children who were born in the United States and are US citizens, according to the statement sent by an attorney representing Torres Maldonado.\n\nThe ruling provides Torres Maldonado with a path to becoming a lawful permanent resident and eventual US citizenship, the statement said.\n\nOfelia was present via Zoom at last week’s hearing.\n\n“Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threatened deportation of her father,” said Kalman Resnick, Torres Maldonado’s attorney. “We mourn Ofelia’s passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what’s right to our last breaths.”\n\nTorres Maldonado, a painter and home renovator, was detained October 18 at a Home Depot store in suburban Chicago as the area was at the center of a major immigration crackdown dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” which began in early September.\n\nOfelia was undergoing treatment when she appeared in October in a video posted on a GoFundMe page set up for the family.\n\n“My dad, like many other fathers, is a hard-working person who wakes up early in the morning and goes to work without complaining, thinking about his family,” she said in the video. “I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted just because they were not born here.”\n\nIn a wheelchair, she attended a hearing for her father in October. The family’s attorneys told a judge at that time that she was released from the hospital just a day before her father’s arrest so she could see family and friends. They added Ofelia had been unable to continue treatment “because of the stress and disruption.”\n\nTorres Maldonado’s attorneys petitioned for his release as his deportation case went through the system. A judge ordered a bond hearing after ruling in October his detention was illegal and violated Torres Maldonado’s due process rights.\n\nA judge later cited Torres Maldonado’s lack of criminal history while allowing his release on a $2,000 bond.\n\nLawyers said Torres Maldonado entered the US in 2003. He and his partner, Sandibell Hidalgo, also have a younger son.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security had alleged he had been living illegally in the US for years and has a history of driving offenses, including driving without a valid license, without insurance and speeding.",

    "description": "Premier League Wolves edge League Two Grimsby in an \"old school cup tie\" which provided an FA Cup \"throwback\".",
    "fullText": "It was, undeniably, an \"old school cup tie\" - one which both managers agreed provided \"a bit of a throwback\".\n\nThe pitch at Blundell Park was already a quagmire before kick-off between League Two Grimsby Town and Premier League Wolves, and rapidly deteriorated under relentless rainfall on the east coast.\n\nThe ball travelled unpredictably across the sodden surface. Players continued to slide for longer than expected. The pitch markings blurred in the mudbath.\n\nIt would be an understatement to suggest the conditions did not aid either team's ambitions of playing attractive football.\n\nBut they did produce fascinating scenes reminiscent of a bygone era, encapsulating the essence and charm of the FA Cup's history.\n\nThere would be no giant-killing here, however. Despite Grimsby's best efforts to test the visitors' resolve, top-flight strugglers Wolves squeezed into the fifth round by scoring from their only shot on target.\n\n\"It was a proper traditional old school cup tie,\" Grimsby boss David Artell told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It was going to be a fine margins game and that's how it was - we limited a Premier League team to one attempt on target and it's gone in.\n\n\"One chance, one goal for them. It showed how well we played in terrible conditions.\n\n\"The conditions made the game in some respects because it was a bit of a throwback.\"\n\nWolves edge past Grimsby on mudbath to reach fifth round\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards will take great encouragement from the gritty nature of his side's victory as they put their league struggles aside to reach the competition's last 16.\n\nThe 43-year-old reiterated to his players the importance of approaching their trip to face fourth-tier opposition with the right mentality, but his words could scarcely have prepared them for the messy reality on the ground.\n\nIndeed, for some of the Wolves players, this was a brutal introduction to the sort of tie which the FA Cup is famed.\n\n\"It was cold, wet, muddy and difficult conditions, but the lads did really well,\" Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It's mad, I quite enjoy these conditions. But there are not many lads in the dressing room who have seen the lower leagues in England.\n\n\"We go out every game to try and win. Our league form has not been great but a cup run would be unbelievable for us and the fans. Hopefully we can keep going and see where it takes us.\"\n\nWhile Wolves have managed just one win after 26 games in their dismal Premier League campaign, back-to-back FA Cup wins against League Two opponents has extended their cup interest into March.\n\nEdwards will hope the competition can yet provide some joy to supporters with relegation to the Championship seemingly inevitable - however the victories come.\n\n\"It was an aggressive game of headers and volleys,\" joked Edwards, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"They were really difficult conditions for both teams. It was a different type of game and a bit of a throwback.\n\n\"It was an eye-opener for a lot of the players when we arrived, the wind was sideways and there were puddles on the pitch.\n\n\"It was never going to be a day for beautiful football. We played with realism, we showed spirit and fight. We did the basics well and came through.\"\n\nEdwards added: \"It was all set up for a cup upset. We talked a lot about mentality over the past few days and the players showed a real desire to win.\"\n\nEdwards' players will have to adapt to a very different challenge on Wednesday, when they trade the Blundell Park mud for hosting Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\nFor Grimsby boss Artell, a \"bowling green\" surface much closer in quality to the one his side stunned Manchester United on in the League Cup earlier this season would also have been preferable.\n\nThe Mariners, on a 10-game unbeaten run stretching back to December, were full of confidence as they targeted another huge upset but were unable to capitalise on their late chances.\n\n\"From my side, we much prefer to play on a better pitch,\" Artell told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We have limited a Premier League side to one shot on target. I don't think either side did enough to win the game, but those are the fine margins.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

    "description": "BBC Scotland looks at Youssef Chermiti's impact for Rangers against Hearts and beyond.",
    "fullText": "A multi-million pound signing, openly derided and much-maligned. Yet, in the two biggest games of Rangers' season, he's been the hero.\n\nYoussef Chermiti cost the Ibrox club a fee of around £8m in the summer, having not scored a goal in two years.\n\nHis name was attached to criticism of former sporting director Kevin Thelwell, with his unconvincing early performances only adding fuel to the fire of his doubters.\n\nYet, against Celtic in the new year's derby, he came good. His two goals shot Rangers to a 3-1 win at Celtic Park, leading to Wilfried Nancy being sacked and pushing Danny Rohl's side past Celtic in the Scottish Premiership table for the first time this season.\n\nOn Sunday, he started in the biggest game of the season so far against league leaders Hearts. Trailing by five points, a win was a must.\n\nThanks to Chermiti, that's what they got.\n\nWith the weight of the world on his shoulders, the Portuguese striker scored a first ever career hat-trick and heaved a chunk of momentum back behind Rangers in the title charge.\n\nWatch: Rangers v Hearts - Sportscene highlights\n\nThe strangest thing about all this - Chermiti has scored just seven league goals this season. Five of them in two games. Two big games, right enough, but two games all the same.\n\nInterestingly enough, he is actually outperforming his xG of just 5.21, despite some notable misses.\n\nThe 21-year-old ranks just 15th in the league's strikers in that metric. When you look at his touches in the opposition box - 60 in total - he ranks down in 26th.\n\nIn 15 league games, 10 of which were starts, he went goalless. Before the 4-2 win over Hearts, he had drawn a blank in his past six games.\n\nFor all that, his impact in big games is immeasurable. Yet, pundit Michael Stewart remains unconvinced.\n\n\"He scored a hat-trick today, which is wonderful for him, but his all-round game is a little bit slack, and his touch at times is very unpredictable,\" said Stewart on Sportscene.\n\nThe opinion that really matters, though, is that of his gaffer and Rohl is clearly a big fan.\n\n\"You give him belief and trust,\" the head coach said through the week, when asked about his striker.\n\n\"You can imagine for Youssef, it's tough for him. Not about the reaction [from fans], it's more about how he feels.\n\n\"He knows he wants to score. He wants a lot for the group. He comes in a good situation. I wish that the next time he takes an extra touch and then he looks for the corner, he makes it.\n\n\"It will come, I totally believe, because I see a lot of things in him.\n\n\"It was the Celtic game when he scored, he turned the game with fantastic goals, and he can do this again. I believe, totally.\"\n\nNot a bad prediction from the 36-year-old, who has masterminded Rangers' resurgent form.\n\nPodcast: Dramatic Sunday in Premiership as Celtic & Rangers narrow gap on leaders Hearts\n\nIn Rohl's first weekend as Rangers boss, they leapt from eighth to fifth thanks to a 3-1 win over Kilmarnock, which featured Chermiti's first goal for the Ibrox club. They were 13 points behind Hearts before a ball was kicked.\n\nYet now, with 11 games of this rollercoaster season left, Rangers are just two behind Derek McInnes' pacesetters.\n\nIt's a turnaround that few could have predicted, and many Rangers fans had already effectively written the league off.\n\nIn 19 league matches in charge, Rohl has won 14, drawn four and lost just one - to Hearts at Tynecastle Park back in December.\n\n\"It's not been pretty for Rangers for the most of this season,\" former Rangers midfielder Scott Arfield said on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. \"Danny Rohl has gone in there and quietly got this team firing again.\"\n\nThe importance of the new head coach cannot be understated, and even caught the eye of Scotland boss Steve Clarke.\n\n\"He's found a way of playing that suits the squad of players that he's got,\" Clarke said on Sky Sports. \"He showed midweek [against Motherwell] that he's not afraid to make changes, so he trusts his squad.\n\n\"When you win matches you get more confidence. If you come in as a manager and start by winning games, immediately the players are going to be onside.\n\n\"The players are with him, the crowd are with him as well. It's been a really good run for Rangers and they're certainly doing very well at the moment.\"\n\nChermiti hat-trick earns Rangers seismic win over leaders Hearts\n\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "France were at their swaggering best in Wales to extend their bid for a first Six Nations Grand Slam since 2022 - so who could stop them?",
    "fullText": "Perhaps it was lost in translation, but Fabien Galthie's declaration that Grand Slam-chasing France \"performed reasonably\" against Wales should be enough to strike fear into Italy, Scotland and England.\n\nWhile the Welsh attempt to somehow avoid a third-straight Wooden Spoon, Les Bleus are hunting a first clean sweep since 2022.\n\nReigning champions France swatted aside Ireland in round one and ran eight tries past Wales in front of a large travelling contingent at the Principality Stadium.\n\nPart three of the Grand Slam bid is against dangerous Italy in Lille on Sunday before Scotland away and England in Paris.\n\n\"We can't stop moving forward,\" said Galthie. \"We are performing reasonably but nothing is sure.\n\n\"We expect a difficult encounter against Italy, so are still working. We had many great parts against Wales but we can do better.\"\n\nIn some ways, what Les Bleus achieved in Cardiff was nothing special - Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa had already hit Steve Tandy's side for half-centuries in the autumn.\n\nThe home side felt their performance was reasonable - and certainly better than in the round one hammering by England - yet they were still overwhelmed in all departments.\n\nFrance scored their first try after 88 seconds and had three inside the opening 15 minutes, with 20-year-old centre Fabien Brau-Boirie scoring on his debut and electric wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey going over for his 23rd try in 24 internationals.\n\nBielle-Biarrey's fellow wing Theo Attissogbe, who has replaced France's all-time record try-scorer Damian Penaud in the side, scored twice in the second half as the visitors claimed their biggest Six Nations triumph in the Welsh capital.\n\nThey could have had even more with an attack marshalled by Antoine Dupont and Matthieu Jalibert racking up 28 line breaks, 31 defenders beaten, 1,136 carry metres and 24 offloads.\n\nInstead, their final try came in the 60th minute from second row Charles Ollivon.\n\n\"When you play a team like that you have to be good at everything,\" said former England and British and Irish Lions captain Martin Johnson on BBC One.\n\n\"France had zero worries because they knew they were going to win, they knew they were too good.\n\n\"They're all so comfortable on the ball. When they're confident and there's no jeopardy, I was thinking 'thank god I'm not on that field'.\n\n\"It's so difficult to contain them when they're that confident and don't feel that anything is going to go wrong for them.\"\n\nJohnson won five Six Nations titles as a player but only two Grand Slams, so knows that potential banana skins lie ahead for Les Bleus.\n\n\"France are massive favourites to win this tournament, everyone is talking about how good they are,\" he said.\n\n\"You've got to deal with that expectation. They're looking very good, they've got huge depth, they've got massive confidence at the moment, but you've got to get them into a point where they feel pressure.\"\n\nFellow former Lions captain Sam Warburton - who won a Grand Slam and title with Wales - believes that is easier said than done.\n\n\"France have got that double-edged sword of physicality up front and the ball-playing ability out wide,\" said the former flanker.\n\n\"They're so potent in attack, they're so difficult to defend against. France are great, I love watching France.\"\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nThat swagger is providing plenty of entertainment for French supporters, who were rewarded for their long weekend in Cardiff with a thumping win.\n\nIt was Wales' smallest Six Nations crowd despite an impressive travelling contingent that boosted the coffers of the capital's pubs.\n\nPlenty will venture to Murrayfield with great expectations, and a little more trepidation.\n\n\"At the end when they were singing, we felt like we were in the Stade de France,\" said star scrum-half Dupont.\n\n\"It's incredible to feel that you are at home when playing away.\"\n\nA win in Lille and another in Edinburgh would give France the chance to secure an 11th Grand Slam against England, the last team to beat them in the Six Nations when Steve Borthwick's side clinched a dramatic 26-25 victory in round two of last year's championship.\n\nTandy is well placed to judge France's qualities after a tough start to his reign that has featured assignments against the Pumas, All Blacks, Springboks and England.\n\n\"They're in a great space to achieve that, but the Six Nations is funny,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"There's no complacency there and they are playing at a high level, so I don't see why they can't win the Grand Slam. They're a formidable outfit.\"\n\n'Murrayfield pain will make England a better team'\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC",

    "description": "Matt Weston becomes the first Briton to win two gold medals at a Winter Olympics with a thrilling victory in the mixed team skeleton alongside Tabitha Stoecker.",
    "fullText": "Team GB made history by winning two Winter Olympic titles on one day for the first time as Matt Weston and Tabitha Stoecker clinched mixed team skeleton gold.\n\nIt came after Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale won the snowboard cross mixed team event earlier on Sunday.\n\nWeston produced a stunning race to make more of his own history in Cortina - he is the first Briton to win two gold medals at a Winter Olympics having claimed individual gold just two days ago.\n\nStoecker, 25, had given Weston a tough task with her run of 1:00.77, 0.18 seconds off the pace of the Germans, with the British pair - ranked top seeds - the last to run.\n\nBut 28-year-old Weston, who won Team GB's first medal at the Games, showed why he is the best skeleton racer in the world with a sublime 58.59secs run to clinch a second medal with a final time of 1:59:36.\n\nIt is also the first time Great Britain have won three gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.\n\n\"The individual event is amazing but doing it as a team when we're normally an individual sport is amazing,\" said Weston.\n\n\"To have my team-mate by my side as Olympic champions, two-time for me which is crazy. I'm looking forward to the celebrations!\"\n\nA second British team, Marcus Wyatt and Freya Tarbit, missed out on a medal by an agonising 0.01secs as the two German teams of Christopher Grotheer and Jacqueline Pfeifer and Axel Jungk and Susanne Kreher took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nGB's Bankes & Nightingale win historic snowboard gold\n\nHow Weston handled pressure to win Olympic gold and GB's first medal\n\nWhy are Team GB so good at skeleton?\n\nThe mixed event, making its debut at Milan-Cortina, sees the sliders hurtle down the track one after the other with a quick reaction time crucial as five red lights going out prompts them to set off.\n\nPushing off before the lights go out results in heavy penalties or even disqualification and that led to many of the sliders erring on the side of caution with some hesitant starts.\n\nJanine Flock, who won gold on Saturday in the women's event, blew the Austrian team's chances when she incurred a one-second penalty for reacting too soon at the start, opening the door for both British teams to get on the podium.\n\nBut the two German teams were too good and the only way Wyatt and Tarbit could have got on the podium would have been if Weston and Stoecker had not.\n\nTwo-time world champion Weston came into this Games stating that only gold would be good enough and he will now walk away as the most decorated man in British Winter Olympics history.\n\nAfter finishing 15th in Beijing four years ago, Weston's rise in the sport has been meteoric and his two Olympic golds add to the three Crystal Globes - overall World Cup titles - he won consecutively from 2024.\n\nFormer bobsledder John Jackson, Olympic bronze medallist in 2014, said: \"Weston has been the cream of the crop of anybody on this track. We are witnessing history right here.\n\n\"He just keeps raising the bar to new standards, and that was absolutely nail-biting stuff when Tabby didn't quite have the run she wanted to give him a chance. Weston absolutely destroyed the field.\"\n\nAs Sunday's competition got increasingly exciting, building to a gripping finale, it was Weston who once again stepped up, having broken the track record in all four runs of the individual event, he produced another immaculate run to turn it into a Super Sunday for GB.\n\n\"Luckily I felt like I knew what I needed to do,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's all a bit of a whirlwind, I took confidence from the individual event and in my head I had to be quite boring and just get the job done.\"\n\nIt took Team GB a week of action in Italy to get their first medal on the board after a series of fourth-place finishes and near misses from the nation's other medal contenders.\n\nBut securing two gold medals in one day - with Bankes and Nightingale's a first ever on snow - certainly goes a long way to improving the landscape.\n\nWhile the one in Livigno came as a surprise, Weston and Stoecker's in Cortina marks a return to the norm for Team GB on the skeleton track.\n\nThe British team have a long history of Olympic skeleton success but a disastrous Games in 2022, where they failed to win a medal for the first time since the sport was reinstated at the Olympics in 2002, is now proving to be an anomaly.\n\nWeston was the heavy favourite coming into the men's event on Friday and he clinched gold with a winning margin of 0.88secs - the second-biggest in skeleton history.\n\nThen, although the British trio of women - Stoecker, Tarbit and Amelia Coltman - did not finish on the podium, they all ended inside the top 10 at their debut Games.\n\nWyatt, who finished ninth in the men's event, said: \"Me and Matt were there in Beijing [2022] and it was good to come and prove that that was a blip and not a trend.\n\n\"What these medals will do for the future of this programme for the next four, eight, 12 years - we are going to be expecting more medals and keeping that rich history of British skeleton alive.\"\n\nWhy first gold on snow has been just a matter of time",
