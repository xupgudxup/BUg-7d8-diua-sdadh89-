    "fullText": "Though Arsenal haven’t won anything yet, the Gunners continue to be in contention for trophies in every competition they’ve participated in this season.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side are four points clear at the top of the Premier League, they’re in the Champions League round-of-16 after finishing top of the League Phase, they’re in the League Cup final, and Sunday’s 4-0 win over Wigan has them in the FA Cup last-16 as well.\n\nIt could still all fall apart, but Arsenal will at least go into March knowing that every trophy is still a possibility.\n\nSpeaking following the win over Wigan, Noni Madueke answered a question in which the reporter suggested Arsenal fans would be getting excited about how the season may end.\n\n“Yeah, for sure, I think they have every right to be,” Madueke told TNT Sports. “We’re working hard to try to deliver the type of season that I think it ought to be, with the way we’re performing right now.\n\n“So that’s our main focus, and yeah, I think it’s exciting. But we need to carry on just doing the right things every single day, and see where we are at the end.”\n\nFor the time being, Arsenal’s focus will turn back to the Premier League, with the two games remaining this month being away trips to Wolves and Spurs.\n\nThanks to Arsenal’s Champions League top-eight finish, the team will then get a rare midweek off before facing Chelsea on March 1st. The FA Cup fifth round (March 7th-8th), the Champions League last-16 (March 10th-18th), and the League Cup final (March 22nd) all take place later in the month.\n\nThe hope is that Arsenal will then still be competing on three fronts in April, with one trophy already in the bag.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers have been one of the most active teams in the offseason, to no one’s surprise. Now, with the offseason winding down, they could make one more move to make sure they are guaranteed to three-peat.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Mark Powell and Wynston Wilcox, that move is trading for Minnesota Twins two-time All-Star and Wilson Overall Defensive Player of the Year Byron Buxton. Buxton would anchor the outfield, and provide another All-Star bat to their lineup.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Padres trade sees San Diego land $330 million two-time MVP, would be massive upgrade from Gavin Sheets\n\n“What big-named player isn't going to have the interest of the LA Dodgers, right? They could use an upgrade on the corners in the outfield so this makes sense. And if you want to stay atop of MLB, the best way to do it is to have a bulletproof lineup. Adding Buxton just improves the bottom of their order. The only dangerous team is one that has a reputable batter, one through nine,” Powell and Wilcox wrote.\n\nThis past season, Buxton slashed .264/.327/.551/.878 with 21 doubles, 35 home runs, and 83 RBI in 126 games played. He would replace Andy Pages in the outfield, and would bring more power and a better glove as well.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Yankees trade sees New York land $330 million two-time MVP to create superstar outfield trio with Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger\n\nHe’s also incredibly cheap by the Dodgers’ standards. He's only set to make around $45 million over the final three years of his contract.\n\nWith time running out, the Dodgers better consider this trade soon before someone else does.\n\nBlue Jays predicted to make blockbuster trade to land $330 million two-time MVP, eight-time All-Star as replacement for George Springer\n\nRed Sox predicted to sign $4.3 million 2.30 ERA reliever to replace Justin Wilson, increase lefty depth in bullpen\n\nDiamondbacks predicted to sign $5.2 million 2024 World Series champion reliever to complement Zac Gallen re-signing",

    "fullText": "Nate Diaz says he is ready to finally settle his long-standing rivalry with Conor McGregor.\n\nDiaz has not fought in the UFC since 2022, back when Francis Ngannou still held the heavyweight belt. But unlike Ngannou, Diaz did not burn any bridges on his way out.\n\nDana White left the door open for him to return, and now, after stints boxing Jake Paul and Jorge Masvidal, the 40-year-old appears interested in coming back.\n\nThis past week, Diaz made it known that he wants to return at the UFC White House event set for June.\n\nInitially, the former UFC star said he would like to face the winner of the UFC 326 BMF title fight between Max Holloway and Charles Oliveira, predicting that ‘Blessed’ would come out on top.\n\nNow, just a week after those comments, Diaz has laid out a new hit list of three names – starting with the long-awaited trilogy against Conor McGregor.\n\nHe told TMZ Sports: “I would like to fight somebody, I’m ready to get back into real action, I want to fight either McGregor (trilogy), I want to fight maybe Dustin Poirier if he stops being such a p—- and then maybe Mike Perry, we’ll see what happens in the future, though.”\n\nFans have clamoured for a decisive third fight between Diaz and McGregor since their UFC 202 rematch in 2016, which left their series tied at 1-1.\n\nAnd interest in that potential third meeting was reignited recently when Dana White dismissed talks of a McGregor vs Michael Chandler bout at the upcoming UFC event.\n\nAn ongoing feud has persisted between Diaz and Dustin Poirier for years. Even with ‘The Diamond’s’ recent retirement, it appeared he would still consider returning for a fight against the Stockton fighter.\n\nOn the other hand, a match-up with Mike Perry would likely fall under BKFC rules – but it is doubtful that Diaz would make a move into bare-knuckle fighting.\n\nDiaz, despite being 40 years old and having passed his fighting prime, consistently remained one of the most popular fighters on the UFC roster.\n\nHe also had a strong relationship with Dana White, even though he and his brother Nick have had their share of differences with the UFC boss over the years.\n\nWhen Diaz left the promotion in 2022, White said it would ‘always’ be Nate’s house. He never completely ruled out a potential return to bring him back onto the roster.\n\nJoe Rogan details why he stopped fighting at 22, citing three key concerns\n\nDana White brags about early Zuffa Boxing success against competitors, ‘I’m beating up…’",

The Swedes also lost to Italy, Britain and the U.S. while beating China.\n\nKennedy reacted angrily to Eriksson's accusation, and World Curling temporarily ramped up official monitoring of matches. On Sunday, the federation scaled that back.\n\nWranå and Eriksson said the kerfuffle was not to blame for the team's struggles. Against Germany, the Swedes were “just making too many half shots and a few mistakes here and there,” Eriksson said.\n\nEriksson had no regrets about raising the issue of double-touching and was happy with the way World Curling handled the situation.\n\n“For us, it’s been a problem the last couple of years,” he said. “So we think it’s good that everyone can play with the same rules.\n\n“Hopefully it’s just getting better from this,” he said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "England narrowly avoided a disaster in their final T20 World Cup group match against Italy on Monday.\n\nHarry Brook won the toss and controversially decided to bat first at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.\n\nEngland were 105/5 after a shaky opening 13 overs before Will Jacks rescued the innings with an unbeaten 53 from 22 balls.\n\nItaly then battled back from 22/3 to 135/4 in their run chase, making the England players and fans nervous.\n\nHowever, the Italians ultimately collapsed to 178 all out, and the Three Lions qualified for the Super 8s.\n\nBrook made an interesting comment about England’s performance in his post-match interview, which many will disagree with.\n\nHarry Brook has every reason to be pleased with his team’s progression into the last eight of the competition.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to suggest that England’s performance against Italy was anything to be proud of.\n\nItaly are the 26th-ranked team in the ICC T20I Team Rankings, so it should never have been a close contest.\n\nThat is why it was so surprising to hear Brook’s claim that England bowled well on Monday.\n\n“I thought we fielded excellently, and we bowled nicely as well,” he said. “I never had a doubt at the end with Sam [Curran] and Jamie [Overton]. Sam has been awesome, and he has been throughout this comp so far.\n\n“When Jof is on a heater, you want to get as much out of as possible – he did that today in his first couple of overs.”\n\nWithout question, England will need to bowl much better in the next stage of the tournament if they want to make the semi-finals.\n\nWhile Brook praised England’s bowlers, he did recognise that their batting unit must improve quickly.\n\n“We haven’t played our best cricket,” he added. “At the end of the day, we have made it through, and we’re heading to Sri Lanka, so we can be happy about that.\n\n“A little bit of a trend in this competition. We have not managed to string along the score as we like to do as a batting unit. We have got to keep on being brave and taking our options.”\n\n202 would normally be an excellent T20 score, but England would have hoped for at least 220 against cricket minnows Italy.\n\nBen Stokes finally has a rude awakening about importance of helmets in cricket\n\nMatthew Renshaw’s scathing interview reveals main culprit behind Australia’s disastrous loss vs. Zimbabwe\n\nSir Geoffrey Boycott reignites Joe Root debate after England’s T20 World Cup loss to West Indies",

The Lady Vols were ranked No. 22 in both the AP poll and USA TODAY coaches poll last week.\n\nTennessee is back in action right away with a road matchup against No. 16 Ole Miss (20-6, 7-4) on Feb. 17 (7 p.m. ET, ESPNU). The game was originally scheduled for Jan. 26 before icy conditions in Oxford, Mississippi, postponed the matchup.\n\nThe Lady Vols will also face Texas A&M at home on Feb. 19 before playing No. 10 Oklahoma on the road Feb. 22.\n\nTennessee started the season as a consensus top-10 team, ranked No. 9 in the coaches preseason poll and No. 8 in the AP preseason poll. It fell out of the top 10 after losing the season opener to NC State and dropped to No. 12 in both polls after starting 2-1.\n\nUT had its biggest drop in the polls after its losses to UCLA, Louisville and South Carolina.

    "description": "Wales needs a specialist defence coach but Welsh rugby greats Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones question when that will happen and who decides.",
    "fullText": "Steve Tandy needs help. As head coach of a crisis-ridden Wales side plunging to new depths every time they take to the field, that much is obvious.\n\nSpecifically, according to two Welsh rugby greats, Tandy needs the support of a full-time defence coach.\n\nHis work as defence coach for Scotland impressed enough to earn the same role with the British and Irish Lions, so Tandy was expected to tighten things up for Wales when he took the reins last September.\n\nYet their has been little case for the defence with Wales.\n\nIn his first six games in charge - albeit including the world's top four teams in their last four Tests - Tandy's Wales have conceded a staggering 302 points and 42 tries.\n\nThe latest battering, Sunday's 54-12 mauling by France in Cardiff, leaves Wales bottom of the Six Nations having already shipped 102 points. No team has conceded \n\nTandy has confirmed Wales will have a specialist defence coach by the summer but the timing of that appointment - and who makes it - has been questioned.\n\nWales cling to optimism despite another record loss\n\nLowest Cardiff Six Nations crowd amid rugby turmoil\n\nScotland game chance for Wales to 'deliver better'\n\nWales have full-time attack and forwards coaches in the form of Matt Sherratt and Danny Wilson, but Tandy only has the temporary support of Dan Lydiate – still very early in his coaching career – in defence.\n\nJuggling that work with his head coach duties, Tandy might be spreading himself too thinly, according to former Wales captains Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\n\"Mid-season it's hard to transition and get someone in,\" Tandy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to have a look at and, probably by the summer, we'll have an option then.\n\n\"It isn't a quick fix. It's something we need to layer and build towards the future.\"\n\nWarburton won two Six Nations titles, including a Grand Slam, with a Wales team built on the rock-solid defensive foundation provided by Shaun Edwards, who now holds that role for France.\n\nThe former Wales captain said Tandy needs help with defence.\n\n\"Steve's admitted he's probably spread himself a bit too thinly,\" Warburton told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He's been doing the defence with Dan Lydiate but then you're trying to do the defence with all the other things that come with being a head coach.\n\n\"Dan is more the micro defensive skills [such as] tackle technique, competition on the floor.\n\n\"Wales don't have a full-time defence coach [and] it's not just about being a coach during campaign time. When the players are playing for their clubs, you're there full-time, watching the regions play, or the Welsh-qualified players playing in England, and you can still keep dialogue and send clips.\n\n\"He needs to bring in a defence coach [but] it sounds like they can't get people out of their contracts because it's difficult to bring people in mid-season.\n\n\"For someone to come in as a full-time defence coach, they need to be tried and tested at this level.\"\n\nWhen taking his role as Welsh Rugby Union's director of rugby last July, Dave Reddin said Tandy would \"not solely select\" his coaching team but would be involved in the process.\n\nHe added: \"It's about getting the right people in those spots as opposed to just getting the next people. It might well be that people are in position already and we need to be a bit more patient.\"\n\nWhoever that new appointment might be, Alun Wyn Jones believes his former Ospreys team-mate Tandy should have the biggest say in the matter.\n\n\"Steve needs to be able to oversee everything and get others to focus on those areas,\" he said.\n\n\"The bigger question I'd ask: Is he going to appoint his own defence coach?\n\n\"There have been questions around that, as opposed to other people in the organisation. That's the most important thing – he's got to be able to pick his own staff.\n\n\"He's got a great grip of the defence, but you can't spread yourself too thinly in that position.\"",

    "description": "It sure seems like Tua Tagovailoa isn't long for Miami as the Dolphins start cleaning house.",
    "fullText": "If you're reading this, then there's a good chance the new-look Miami Dolphins also released you from their roster on Monday.\n\nOK, obviously not really. You don't play in the NFL. Still, the Dolphins were quite busy cleaning up some perceived dead weight on their roster. For one, perennial All-Pro receiver Tyreek Hill was released as he recovers from a knee injury. He's probably going to find a new NFL home soon enough; it just won't be in Southern Florida. So was high-priced pass-rusher, Bradley Chubb.\n\nHill's release, in particular, raises an interesting, more pertinent question for first-year head coach Jeff Hafley and company. What's quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's future in Miami? Are the rebuilding/retooling Dolphins willing to stick it out at least one more season with a quarterback who has proven he's not good enough? Or do they want to cut bait right now and simply get on with their lives?\n\nAccording to Jordan Schultz, it sounds like Tagovailoa has likely played his last snap for the Dolphins, one way or another. If they can't find a trade partner for the veteran signal-caller, he will probably be released in short order before the 2026 NFL league year begins on Wednesday, March 11th.\n\nThe #Dolphins preference has been to find a trade partner for Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nA cut is possible in the end. But that has been their preference.\n\nMy understanding is new regime doesn’t want it to drag too long. https://t.co/CC2KShHuvP\n\n— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) February 16, 2026\n\nLet's cut to the chase. I would be stunned if someone traded for Tagovailoa. The mere fact that he's being shopped has leaked to an insider of sorts tells me the Dolphins are having trouble finding suitors for the NFL's 11th-highest paid quarterback by total guaranteed money. It's clear no one wants to foot the bill for a quarterback whose smallest cap hit over the next three seasons will be $53.4 million, per Over The Cap. That's Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen money, not mediocre quarterback money.\n\nAs such, news like this is usually the precursor to a player like Tagovailoa getting released soon after. Of course, that doesn't come without a cost. If the Dolphins release Tagovailoa before June 1st, they will incur $99.2 million in dead salary cap money. That's ... steep and restrictive to any possible team-building Miami might want to do this offseason. But it seems leadership is prepared to rip the Tagovailoa Band-Aid off now, rather than let him linger around the organization in a new era. The Dolphins aren't necessarily trying to be competitive in 2026. Tagovailoa's release would be a bold calculation with a long-term perspective.\n\nPerhaps, that's what the Dolphins need more than anything after flirting with middling irrelevance for the past few seasons.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Will Dolphins release Tua Tagovailoa?

    "fullText": "It is often read that superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is not always in control of his own emotions.\n\nNow, a former teammate of the Portuguese superstar has spilled the beans and given insight into his emotional world.\n\nNani accompanied Ronaldo at the beginning of his world career at Sporting Lisbon. Later, the two were under contract together at Manchester United and played together in the Portuguese national team.\n\nThe 39-year-old is currently under contract with FK Aktobe in Kazakhstan and spoke in the magazine ‘FourFourTwo’ about Ronaldo's occasional emotional outbursts.\n\nAccording to him, Ronaldo stood out from the crowd as a child and knew exactly what he wanted: “Cristiano lived football with immense passion. If he didn’t win or things didn’t go well, he cried,” Nani said.\n\nThis showed how committed he was and with what intensity he lived the game.\n\nThat the five-time world footballer has not yet stopped at 41 years old does not surprise the left winger. Rather, he is sure that his former teammate will still reach the 1000-goal mark in his career: “I have no doubt about that. It’s a milestone that is important to him and something he has had in mind for years,” said Nani.\n\nAccording to ‘transfermarkt.de’, Ronaldo currently stands at 956 goals for his clubs and the Portuguese national team – so only 44 more to go.\n\nSounds doable, right? What do you think: Will Cristiano Ronaldo reach this milestone? Feel free to write it in the comments.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

Colorado’s opener has now been shifted off a traditional Saturday for the third straight season and for the 12th time in the last 14 years. Last season’s opener against Georgia Tech at Folsom Field was played on a Friday night.\n\nThe Sept. 3 matchup marks the second game of a home-and-home series between the programs. Georgia Tech holds a 1-0 edge after a 27-20 win in Boulder last season. The Buffaloes will look to even the series in what will be just their second game played in the state of Georgia. Colorado previously faced Georgia in 2006.\n\nMore:Shedeur Sanders’ jersey retirement was 'breaking point' for Colorado legend\n\nThe trip to Atlanta also carries added significance for Sanders, who starred there with the Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta Braves. On Oct. 11, 1992, he famously played in both an NFL and MLB game on the same day. Sanders was taken by the Falcons fifth overall in the 1989 NFL Draft.\n\nColorado’s home opener is scheduled for Sept. 12 against Weber State. The Buffaloes finished 3-9 in 2025, the worst record of Sanders’ tenure.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "fullText": "New York Mets owner Steve Cohen may have lost out on the Kyle Tucker sweepstakes, but he isn’t backing down from spending big on high-level free agents.\n\nAnthony DiComo, Mets beat writer for MLB.com, quoted Cohen admitting the Los Angeles Dodgers have built a high-level franchise, but he indicated he’s not intimidated.\n\n“They’re formidable,” DiComo shared on social media. “They have the ability to spend. So do I, by the way.”\n\nThe Dodgers have taken some criticism in recent years over their spending to acquire big-name free agents like Shohei Ohtani and Tucker.\n\nThe $240 million contract for Tucker in particular has renewed interest in a possible salary cap in Major League Baseball, which is the only major North American sports league without one.\n\nCohen has admitted he wanted to sign Tucker this offseason and was “annoyed” the team failed to land the prized outfielder.\n\nThe Mets also lost closer Edwin Díaz to the Dodgers, though they were able to sign infielder Bo Bichette, whom the Dodgers had targeted.\n\nIn an interview with Mets broadcaster Howie Rose, Cohen has made the case that the team ultimately is better off with Bichette over Tucker.\n\n“Frankly, once it was all done, and we got Bo to come to the Mets, (I) actually feel Bo might be a better fit for the team,” said Cohen, as reported by Tim Britton for The Athletic. “So I think things worked out for the best.”\n\nWhile fans and owners of other teams might feel like the Dodgers are bad for baseball, current players — even those who face off against the Boys in Blue regularly — love what the team is doing.\n\n“I f—ing love it,” San Diego Padre and former Dodger Manny Machado said of the Dodgers’ spending. “Every team should be doing it. …S— is f—ing great for the game. So I think every team has the ability to do it, so I hope all 30 teams can learn from that.”\n\nBryce Harper of the Philadelphia Phillies echoed that sentiment.\n\n“I love what the Dodgers do, obviously,” Harper said. “They pay the money, they spend the money. I mean, they’re a great team. They understand how to run it. They run their team like a business, and they run it the right way. They understand where they need to put their money into.”",

    "fullText": "There's a new No. 1 team in the nation.\n\nMichigan basketball (24-1, 14-1 Big Ten) moved up one spot, to No. 1, in the USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll on Monday, Feb. 16; the Wolverines were last atop the poll in its Jan. 5 iteration − five days before the Wolverines lost to Wisconsin in Ann Arbor, their only defeat this season.\n\nMichigan has won 10 consecutive games since, nine by double figures. The Wolverines are coming off another sweep last week, knocking off Northwestern on the road and crushing UCLA at home; with previous No. 1 Arizona losing twice last week, U-M has now taken over the top spot with less than four weeks to play before the reveal of the 2026 March Madness bracket.\n\n[ MUST WATCH: U-M's biggest week of the regular season is here. Make \"Hail Yes!\" your go-to Wolverines podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify). ]\n\nMichigan has been ranked No. 1 for 38 games in its 108-year history.\n\nThis is the latest in a season Michigan has been ranked No. 1 since it was No. 1 in the Associated Press poll on March 7, 1977 in the final poll before the NCAA tournament. Soon after, the Wolverines were upset by Charlotte in the NCAA's second round.\n\nPrior to that, Michigan hadn't been ranked No. 1 in February or later since 1965. That was the year consensus All-American Cazzie Russell led the Wolverines to the national championship game, which U-M lost to UCLA after holding onto the nation's top spot for more than three months.\n\nMichigan State, which has lost three of its past four games, dropped to No. 15 in this week's coaches poll, down from No. 10 last week.\n\nThis season, Michigan has dominated on both sides of the ball. The Wolverines are No. 1 in defensive efficiency (88 points per 100 possessions) and average 2-point distance (7.1 feet), No. 2 in 2-point defense (42.8%) and effective field goal defense (43.2), No. 4 in block rate (18.7%) and No. 7 in 3-point defense (29.1%).\n\nREQUIRED READING: How Michigan basketball built nation's biggest and best frontcourt\n\nOffensively, the Wolverines are No. 2 in 2-point shooting (63%), No. 4 in efficiency (126.6), No. 7 in effective field goal percentage (58.9%), No. 7 in average possession length (15 seconds) and No. 24 in offensive rebounding rate (36.6%).\n\nMichigan can't rest on its statistical excellence, however, with a tough slate this week: The Wolverines hit the road for a matchup with No. 7 Purdue on Tuesday (6:30 p.m., Peacock) before a neutral-court meeting with No. 3 Duke at Capital One Arena in Washington on Saturday (6:30 p.m., ESPN).\n\n\"It feels really good, but as you said, we have tough games now coming up,\" center Aday Mara said last week. \"We got to focus on, on that, on our scout, on practicing, getting better. ... Our goal is not being No. 1 in the country – our goal is to win everything.\"\n\nTony Garcia is the Wolverines beat writer for the Detroit Free Press.

    "description": "Benfica manager Jose Mourinho has distanced himself from a return to the Bernabeu in the home dugout, as his side prepares to face Los Blancos in the Champions League play-off round. With no certainty...",
    "fullText": "Benfica manager Jose Mourinho has distanced himself from a return to the Bernabeu in the home dugout, as his side prepares to face Los Blancos in the Champions League play-off round. With no certainty over the future of Alvaro Arbeloa beyond the summer, it has been suggested that Mourinho could potentially be in the running to return.\n\nArbeloa took over without a plethora of obvious candidates to replace Xabi Alonso. The name of Jurgen Klopp continues to come up, but the former Liverpool manager has also distanced himself from the job. President Florentino Perez has also held Mourinho in especially high regard too.\n\n“Yes, you can,” Mourinho responded when asked if it was possible to say no to Real Madrid though, and went on to explain that he had not spoken to Perez since the start of the season.\n\n“The last time was when I signed with Benfica. He told me he was very happy because I had signed for a great club. He didn’t come to the previous match; I hope he’ll be here tomorrow and I can talk to him. We’re great friends,” he told Diario AS.\n\nThe Portuguese manager continued to sing the praises of all of those at the Bernabeu for the second time in the past month though. Even if he is able to get out of his current contract to join Real Madrid, Mourinho played down the idea.\n\n“I gave everything I had to Real Madrid. I did some things well and some things poorly, but I gave it my all. When a professional gives everything, there’s a connection that lasts forever. My feeling after these 12 years with the Madrid fans is the same as my own: they respect me and hold me in high esteem. It’s fantastic for me.”\n\n“I don’t want to fuel stories that don’t exist. I have one more year on my contract with Benfica; it’s special because it’s an election period and we wanted to protect a new president. It has an easy-to-break clause. I have nothing against Real Madrid. I would love to eliminate Real Madrid, but I would really like Arbeloa to win La Liga and stay at Real Madrid for many years, because he has a lot of talent. He’s a true Madridista and has a lot of personality.”\n\nMourinho’s time at Real Madrid, despite the love held by some, remains highly controversial too, due to his behaviour on the touchline and in the press room.\n\n“I wouldn’t change anything because I can’t change anything now. I’m happy I gave it my all. It doesn’t matter if you make mistakes, because you gave everything you had. That’s what I tell my players. If you fail, it’s okay, you tried everything. I’m happy with myself.”\n\nSimilarly, he had no regrets about exiting Real Madrid. Mourinho left after four years with a Copa del Rey and a Liga title to show for his efforts in terms of major honours, but they did manage to slow down Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona.\n\n“I must be one of the few Real Madrid coaches to leave without being sacked. When you leave of your own accord, you have nothing to envy. I left with a clean conscience. I’ll never forget what the president told me when I left: ‘Now comes the easy part, the hard part is over.’ My family is the most important thing to me, and that was the best thing.”\n\n“It was also the best thing for Real Madrid. After difficult, intense, and turbulent years, everything Real Madrid has done since has only brought me joy. I don’t feel like I’m part of anything; the credit belongs to those who were there. The Estádio da Luz is a stadium of happiness for Real Madrid. They lost, but they weren’t eliminated; they won a Champions League title here.”\n\nReal Madrid will be hoping for revenge over Benfica on Tuesday night at the Estadio da Luz, albeit this time with the second leg in Madrid to fall back on. Kylian Mbappe is set to return to action, but Raul Asencio is missing through suspension. There were positive minutes for Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold, who did not play a part in their first meeting.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy cited loyalty and his desire to win when asked why he extended with the Dodgers.\n\nThe veteran has been with the Dodgers’ organization since 2017, and he has become a two-time All-Star and three-time World Series champion while playing for L.A. He signed a one-year extension for $7 million with a $10 million club option Thursday.\n\n“Part of me and who I am as a person and how I was raised, I like to be loyal to people,” Muncy said. “This organization took a chance on me when I was out of baseball, basically. That meant a lot to me. They stuck with me when things were going bad. They’ve never wavered on me at all. That means a lot to me in itself, and it’s just a place I’m very comfortable. My family’s comfortable here. We have a chance to win every single year. That’s why I play this game. I want to win.\n\n“Obviously, you make money in this game, but that’s not why I play. I play because I want to win. It’s the competitive fire that I want to go out and win as much as I can. That to me is worth more than money. I know I’m leaving money on the table, but I’m more than OK with that because I wouldn’t be OK with myself trying to chase money somewhere else, watching this team win and I’m on the sidelines. That’s just not who I am. I would rather win.\n\n“Another component to it is just the relationship I’ve built here. Like I was just saying, I like to be loyal and my relationships mean a lot. I’ve created such a relationship with the staff, the front office, the coaches, the medical and training staff, the clubhouse guys. I just don’t want to create that somewhere else. Being here for my entire career at this point would mean the world to me, and this gives me the chance to do that.”\n\nAsked Max Muncy about his latest extension, one of many team-friendly deals he has signed w/ the Dodgers since they gave him a second chance after he was released by the A's in 2017.\n\nHe knows he left money on the table, but he wouldn't be OK leaving and watching the Dodgers win: pic.twitter.com/hTyQCrCPT6\n\n— Rowan Kavner (@RowanKavner) February 13, 2026\n\nMuncy is the longest-tenured Dodger after Clayton Kershaw’s retirement, and is clearly a huge factor for the team if they’re winning to extend him though the 2028 season.\n\nHe had a great season in 2025 before struggling with injury, hitting 19 homers and tallying 67 RBIs through 100 games.\n\nThe 35-year-old also played a key role in the postseason, hitting an oft-forgotten homer in Game 7 of the World Series to cut the Toronto Blue Jays’ lead to one run in the bottom of the eighth inning.\n\nThe Dodgers clearly want Muncy to stick around, and if he can continue to produce how he has for the last several seasons at the plate, he’ll be an asset to the Dodgers’ title defense and three-peat aspirations.\n\nHow do you feel about Max Muncy’s extension?",

    "fullText": "Coach Brad Brownell's Clemson Tigers have lost back-to-back games in ACC play for the first time this season.\n\nClemson (20-6 overall, 10-3 conference) fell in a 76-66 upset loss to Virginia Tech at Littlejohn Coliseum on Wednesday. On Saturday, the Duke Blue Devils turned a close game at halftime into a double-digit wallop behind Cameron Boozer and Isaiah Evans in a 67-54 win at Cameron Indoor Stadium.\n\nThe Tigers may have entered the week tied with Duke in the ACC standings, but coach Jon Scheyer's Blue Devils left no doubt that the road to the ACC still runs through Durham and Cameron Indoor. Boozer finished with 18 points and Evans had 17 as Duke would lead by as many as 16 in the second half.\n\nCarter Welling led Clemson with 12 points against Duke and RJ Godfrey had 10. Prior to last week, the Tigers had won 13 of 14 games since suffering back-to-back losses to Alabama and BYU in early December.\n\nWith only five games remaining on Clemson's 2025-26 regular-season basketball schedule, here's where the Tigers land in this week's USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll.\n\nClemson is ranked No. 24 in the Monday's new USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll entering Week 16 of the 2025-26 college basketball season. The Tigers are ranked one spot below Miami (Ohio), and one spot ahead of the Wisconsin Badgers.\n\nDuke (23-2) remains the ACC's highest-ranked team, moving up three spots to No. 3. The Virginia Cavaliers (22-3, 10-2) jumped past North Carolina (20-5) to become the ACC's second-highest ranked team at No. 14 after the Tar Heels fell in an upset loss to Miami on Tuesday.\n\nUNC fell seven spots to No. 20. The ACC has five teams ranked in the top 25. With Clemson bookending the rankings at No. 24, the Louisville Cardinals (19-6) moved up two spots to No. 21 following their fourth straight win on Saturday against the Ohio State Buckeyes.\n\nFor the first time since Jan. 5, there's a new No. 1 in the Coaches Poll. The Michigan Wolverines (24-1) reclaimed the top spot after the Arizona Wildcats (23-2) suffered their first losses of the season to Kansas and Texas Tech, respectively.\n\nArizona had spent five weeks at No. 1 in the Coaches Poll prior to Monday.\n\nHere's a look at the full Week 16 rankings in the USA TODAY Sports men's basketball coaches poll.\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide 32; Villanova Wildcats 30; Utah State Aggies 20; Tennessee Volunteers 19; Iowa Hawkeyes 7; Kentucky Wildcats 6; Saint Mary's 2; Miami Hurricanes 1.\n\nClemson basketball’s odds to win ACC plummet after loss to Duke https://t.co/rTkMTkjZYM pic.twitter.com/eSwYLHKjYo\n\n— Clemson Wire (@Clemson_Wire) February 16, 2026\n\nClemson will visit Wake Forest (13-12, 4-8) Wednesday night in Winston-Salem.

    "description": "The Dodgers agreed to sign infielder Santiago Espinal to a minor league deal on Monday after Tommy Edman got a bad injury update.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers agreed to sign infielder Santiago Espinal to a minor league deal on Monday, adding depth to the team as position players start reporting to Spring Training.\n\nThe Dodgers revealed that utility player Tommy Edman will not be ready to go for Opening Day, eliminating an infield piece from the roster outlook.\n\n“Tommy certainly won’t be ready for Opening Day,” manager Dave Roberts said. “He took some swings a couple days ago, both sides, he did some skipping, some light jogging, I think it was.\n\n“Getting his body into baseball shape. Obviously, he’s not going to be ready for the start of camp and he’s in that same bucket of ‘when he’s ready he’s ready.’ Each day there’s progress.”\n\nWhen healthy, Edman is counted on to be the starting second baseman who can fill in all across the field, though especially filling in at center field due to his range and mobility.\n\nWith him out of the picture, at least to start the year, the Dodgers signed Santatio Espinal, a six-year veteran who has spent time with the Toronto Blue Jays and Cincinnati Reds, more recently.\n\nEspinal has played second base, third base, shortstop, and the outfield, providing the Dodgers with the same versatility as Edman.\n\nLos Angeles has long valued versatile players under the president of baseball operations, Andrew Friedman, who has added players like Kike Hernandez, Miguel Rojas, and Chris Taylor over the years, keeping them on for multiple years.\n\nEspinal could become the latest addition to become a veteran, versatile mainstay if he can turn things around as a hitter.\n\nGot an update on Tommy Edman. Dave Roberts said he won't be ready for Opening Day:\n\n\"He took some swings a couple of days ago. Both sides. He did some skipping. Light jogging. He's not going to be ready for the start of camp. Tommy certainly won't be ready for Opening Day.\" pic.twitter.com/bpojlp1yFb\n\n— Doug McKain (@DMAC_LA) February 16, 2026\n\nFor the first four years of his career with the Toronto Blue Jays, Espinal was above replacement level, even having two seasons worth 2.4 bWAR. In 2022, he made the All-Star team with Toronto; however, 2023 was a down year for the righty.\n\nThe Blue Jays chose to move on from him, dealing the infielder to the Reds for a pitcher. In two years with the Reds, he had -1.8 bWAR, hitting .245/.294/.322. His OPS+ was a measly 68, showing how poor his overall hitting was.\n\nIf he can play as he did in 2021 and 2022, Espinal could play a key role with the Dodgers and secure a spot in the postseason platoon, ready to step up in case of an injury.\n\nDodgers fans should be excited about his arrival, as his steady presence should provide stability until Edman is ready to play.\n\nEdman did not look right for long stretches last season as he dealt with the ankle issue, though Espinal buys him more time to recover and get healthy.",

    "title": "NFL Mock Draft Monday: The Sun Devils you might know",
    "description": "Who do you want the Eagles to draft?",
    "fullText": "Some of us may have the day off, but mock drafts never do.\n\nAfter a brief pause in 2024, Howie Roseman got back to trading first-round picks last year. He sticks to that habit by sending a late third- and fourth-round pick to the Vikings so he can snag another big-play machine for an Eagles offense that disappointed in 2025. Tyson dealt with multiple injuries at the college level but could prove to be a steal here, thanks to his ability to win downfield.\n\nIn this mock the Eagles trade up to 18 with the Vikings. If something like this were to happen, this would be another “how are teams letting the Eagles do this” move. Tyson has a lot of love in the draft community. I don’t quite get the hype, but that’s just me.\n\nHe may not have as much love in the NFL community though, as his injury history is a big concern. He missed time in 2022 and 2023 from a torn ACL, MCL, and PCL. He missed time in 2024 with a broken collarbone. He missed time in 2025 with injuries to both hamstrings.\n\nThe Eagles have work to do along the offensive line this offseason, especially with the injury issues that 35-year-old right tackle Lane Johnson had in 2025. Iheanachor had a great week at the Senior Bowl that fortified his status as one of the highest-upside players in this class. He has terrific size at 6-foot-6 and 330 pounds, plus his nifty footwork allows him to hold up in pass protection.\n\nIheanachor will need time to develop, as he did not play high school football and must refine his technique. (He took nine penalties in 2025, too.) Philly would be an ideal landing spot since he can sit and learn behind a future Hall of Famer for at least a year.\n\nIheanachor is a risk, but that has never stopped the Eagles.\n\nIheanachor moved to America from Nigeria when he was 13 and as Yates says, he didn’t play football in high school, starting his career at East Los Angeles College, a JUCO, transferring after two seasons. He started all 14 Sun Devil games this year, and 5 last year. A team that can have him continuing to bake as a backup makes sense, he’s got a lot of room to grow. He moves pretty stiff, and he looks like he’s still figuring things out. I’d also like to see my big OT play with some nastinesses, which I didn’t see from him.\n\nThe need to develop is to be expected, he wasn’t playing football five years ago. But new OL coach Chris Kuper has no track record of development, and Lane Johnson has missed time in every season since 2015, so his primary backup is going to see the field.\n\nIf AJ Brown moves on this offseason, the Philadelphia Eagles could turn to Washington’s Denzel Boston to fill the X-receiver role. Boston blends size, skill, and scoring ability into a package tailor-made for the NFL, offering a proven knack for turning targets into explosive plays.\n\nBoston’s fluidity, tempo management, and zone IQ also give him polished route-running skills, making him a true X-receiver prospect with immediate impact potential. For the Eagles, he offers the kind of contested-catch ability and downfield production that can change the dynamic of the passing game from day one.\n\nWe can go ahead and skip the “if.” One reason is that this is a good draft for big WRs, replacing AJ Brown, at least in theory, will be an option in the draft. Along with Boston, Ohio State’s Carnell Tate–who won’t be on the board when the Eagles currently pick, Jordyn Tyson, Louisville’s Chris Bell, and Notre Dame’s Malachi Fields are options too.\n\nBoston does a really good job of using his size as a weapon, but he’s not just a contested catch merchant, his separation is good too. He might not run the fastest 40 but he can go get the ball down the field. I’m a fan.",

He was hired as a passing game specialist for the 49ers in 2020 before heading to the Jets with former head coach Robert Saleh as the club’s linebackers coach from 2021-2024. He then followed Ulbrich to the Falcons in 2025.\n\nMonken has said he would like the Browns to retain the same scheme that Schwartz ran, given its effectiveness.

    "description": "Curtis Jones Contract Doubts Raise Questions Over Liverpool’s Midfield FutureUncertainty over Curtis Jones’ future at Liverpool has become a fresh talking point as the midfielder approaches the fi...",
    "fullText": "Uncertainty over Curtis Jones’ future at Liverpool has become a fresh talking point as the midfielder approaches the final year of his contract. With Arne Slot already navigating pressure during a difficult title defence that has left the Reds sixth in the Premier League, the prospect of another unresolved deal adds an extra layer of intrigue to an already complex season.\n\nSpeaking to Dave Davis on Anfield Index’s Media Matters podcast, David Lynch delivered a candid assessment of the situation. He said, “With Jones, it’s not great that he has gone down to his last 12 months and the fact that he was open to going in January.” That admission highlights the delicate balance Liverpool must strike between rewarding a homegrown player and protecting the club’s long term planning.\n\nJones has played an important role in recent performances, offering energy and technical quality in midfield. Yet contract uncertainty often shifts the conversation away from form on the pitch and towards long term strategy, something Liverpool have experienced repeatedly over the past year.\n\nLynch raised an interesting point about wider trends across European football. He explained, “However, is this a growing trend in football? To drag your contract to the final year and increase your bargaining power because we’re seeing it a lot more. Just look at Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah last year, then Dayot Upamecano at Bayern Munich more recently.”\n\nThe modern football landscape has changed dramatically, with players and agents increasingly aware of the leverage created by shorter contract timelines. For Liverpool, who have traditionally preferred to secure extensions well before deals enter their final stages, this shift represents a new challenge.\n\nJones’ situation feels particularly significant because he represents the academy pathway that supporters value deeply. Losing a local talent, especially during a period when Slot is trying to reshape the squad’s identity, would carry emotional as well as tactical consequences.\n\nExternal interest has only intensified the discussion. Clubs such as Inter Milan and Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly monitoring the midfielder, which naturally strengthens the player’s negotiating position. Liverpool’s hierarchy must now decide whether to accelerate talks or risk entering next season with a key asset approaching free agency.\n\nLynch’s outlook remains cautious, stating, “I hope it is just that but the other signs around it aren’t great and if you were to ask me what is going to happen, I’m not massively encouraged that he is going to be here next season.” That perspective reflects a growing sense that Liverpool may face difficult decisions in the months ahead.\n\nFrom a tactical viewpoint, Jones offers versatility that suits Slot’s evolving system. As Liverpool continue their Champions League campaign and pursue FA Cup success, maintaining squad depth will be crucial. The Brighton victory recently offered a glimpse of renewed cohesion, yet long term planning continues behind the scenes.\n\nContract negotiations often reveal as much about a club’s strategy as they do about individual players. Liverpool are in a transitional phase following last season’s title triumph, balancing immediate results with the need to build a sustainable future. Jones’ decision could become a symbol of how the next phase of Slot’s project unfolds.\n\nSupporters may hope that discussions lead to clarity sooner rather than later, particularly as performances have begun to show signs of improvement. For now, the situation remains unresolved, shaped by market trends, player ambition and the club’s wider ambitions.\n\nWhatever happens next, Lynch’s comments underline the uncertainty that surrounds Liverpool’s midfield planning. As the season progresses, the Jones contract story may prove as influential off the pitch as any result achieved on it.",

    "fullText": "With the 2026 MLS kits officially released, we rank them in our latest installment of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.\n\nIt’s that time of year when MLS clubs and adidas reveal a whole range of new kits, and that means we get to eat. I’ve sifted through them all, analyzing them for the latest edition of our The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly series. From beauties like Inter Miami to downright disgraces like Nashville, let’s tuck in and review them all.\n\nInspired by the 1996 Olympics medal design, this Atlanta United kit is fantastic. An off-white base color complemented by gold detailing and a beautiful green stripe down the side is a top notch design that doesn’t try too hard.\n\nThe Carolina blue on this shirt is loud, loud enough for me to sit up and listen. The crown pattern used on the neckline trim and sleeve cuffs really elevates the shirt. I love it.\n\nTraditional, yet effective. I tossed and turned over adding this to the good section due to the white section across the middle, and I settled on the fact that the classic collar saves it. A nice shade of red that pays tribute to the Chicago Fire’s history. I’m in.\n\nBlack shirt? Good start. Add a multi-colored collar and sleeve cuffs to jazz thing up bit and you’re starting to speak a bit of my language. Simple base design, elevated with some exciting details. This one is good.\n\nI’d say this is top two from the whole collection. Black and yellow is a good combination, especially when you mix it with such a classic collar and sleeve trim. Beautiful stuff. Identity, reinforced.\n\nThis is a big yes. All black base with hints of red. That’s it. Sorted.\n\nIt’s a bit of a cheat code to have your base colors as pink and black, just ask Palermo. There’s a reason they’re such a cult hero. Inter Miami have reversed this colorway for this kit, and it’s working. A button-up collar, too? Mamma Mia-mi.\n\nIt’s a bit of James Bond and a bit of Jay Gatsby all rolled into one for a team right out of the city that never sleeps. A team from the Big Apple deserves the finest, and this is it. Brilliant.\n\nVenture across the city, and you get the New York Red Bulls. People aren’t typically a fan of Red Bull-owned clubs, but I won’t open that can of worms. My placement of this kit in the good section might be biased, because it gives me a mix of Stranger Things and Mount Vesuvius, which happen to be two of my favorite things.\n\nPurple and yellow shouldn’t work. But on this shirt, I am having it. Maybe I’m just feeling a bit jazzy today. Yes.\n\nA kit with a pattern of the Declaration of Independence with imagery of the Founding Fathers? If you’re going to do a kit for an American team, then this is how you do it.\n\nUnlike FC Dallas’ shirt, which we’ll get to momentarily, this is a properly done blue and red hooped shirt.\n\nOh, yes. The colors on this shirt are beautiful and the neck and sleeve trims are just delightful. A top, top shirt.\n\nThis is the type of kit that’d make a bit of noise because it’s somewhat different. However, it misses the mark. While it’s not entirely ugly, it looks like it should be used as a wrapper for some form of spearmint-based candy. I don’t like it. And I’m always right.\n\nFor some reason, this shirt does not work for me at all. The sublimated pattern across the shirt is terrible, and it looks like some knock off you’d see being hawked in a stall at a Fourth of July parade. All that said, it’s not a total disaster, and I can definitely see people liking this iteration of a tried-and-true football shirt design.\n\nThe idea isn’t bad. Gold and black are a strong combination. However, this execution doesn’t quite hit the mark. The Art Deco pattern doesn’t hit for me, and it seems like a missed opportunity when you have two incredibly strong colors.\n\nIt’s classic LA Galaxy, but that’s it. The sash, though, is not hitting the vibe at all. The random glitch in the middle of it is the main culprit. Overall, it just feels a bit stale.\n\nIf they didn’t have the sash caused by the pattern ending, then this shirt would be decent. A design choice that screams “I am trying so hard to be different,” but misses the mark entirely when doing so. Overdoing it.\n\nWhat in the comic book fight scene is this?!\n\nTie-dye? In the big 2026? I get that they’re paying tribute to the Grateful Dead, but there’s better ways to do so. See: Nike SB.\n\nIf this didn’t have the weird material effect on it, it’d look less like a curtain on a terrible award show stage and instead, it’d be a decent kit.\n\nThis feels medieval. Do you get what I mean?\n\nThe only thing good about this kit is the collar trim and sleeve trim, but they’re not powerful enough to overcome the geometric pattern. A terrible shirt. A pattern like this on a football shirt can be difficult to get right, and this one is certainly far from the mark. Blech.\n\nI can’t believe this got signed off by professionals. It’s terrible. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it looks like it belongs in a rogue knock-off arcade game. The diamonds pattern offends me every single time I look at it.\n\nNot for me, at all. I respect it for being so bold, but I don’t like it at all. The abstract pattern would work better if they didn’t split it into stripes, to be honest. I’ll take my payment for the design consultancy via bank transfer, please.\n\nWhatever Columbus Crew can do, we can do 10x worse. Nah.\n\nThis colourway is called “Ice Yellow.” More like “Not Very Nice Yellow.” Am I right?",

Today I’m back to share some behind-the-scenes about the struggles and development of a new functionality for Sniffnet: process identification, a.k.a. the most requested feature since the very beginning of the project.",
    "fullText": "Hey everyone, it’s already been two months since the last blog post!\n\nToday I’m back to share some behind-the-scenes about the struggles and development of a new functionality for Sniffnet: process identification, a.k.a. the most requested feature since the very beginning of the project.\n\nWith “process identification” in a network monitoring context, I mean the possibility to discover which application or program is responsible for a given network connection.\n\nThis can be determined by looking at the open TCP/UDP ports on the system and finding out which process is currently using them.\n\nIf implementing this feature seems like a no-brainer to you, well… read on because it turned out to be a much more complex task than I could imagine, and this is the reason why the related GitHub issue has been open for almost 3 years.\n\nFirst of all, the implementation is highly OS-specific: each platform has its own directories and data structures storing such information, and APIs to interact with them are often not well documented or written in C (therefore not very ergonomic to use from Rust). \n\nAnd unfortunately, there is no Rust library ready-to-use satisfying the needs of Sniffnet.\n\nOne could argue that this is a solved problem, since there are already existing tools to do it: for instance, on Linux and Windows you have netstat, and on macOS you have lsof or nettop. \n\nHowever, these tools are not designed to be used as libraries and spawining a shell to execute them repeatedly is not efficient, especially if you want to monitor the network activity in real-time. \n\nMoreover, they don’t provide all the information Sniffnet needs, such as the process name and path.\n\nBut the biggest challenge is another one: the least system-intrusive ways to implement the feature are snapshot-based, meaning that they require to read the system state at a given moment in time and do some computations to find out the associations between open ports and their owning processes. \n\nI’m referring to using libproc on macOS, the /proc filesystem on Linux, and iphlpapi on Windows. \n\nThis is not a problem in itself, but it generates the need to do this processing very efficiently, and it leads to cases where it’s not possible to retrieve process information at all.\n\nFor instance, short-lived connections can go undetected and system processes with elevated privileges can be hidden to user-space applications for security reasons.\n\nMore system-intrusive approaches exist, such as using kernel-level hooks to intercept the system calls responsible for creating network connections. \n\nAn example of this is eBPF on Linux, which requires to run privileged code inside the kernel. \n\nOn macOS, you’d even need entitlements from Apple to be able to do something similar through their Network Extension framework. \n\nWhile these approaches are way more accurate, they go against Sniffnet’s philosophy of being a lightweight, non-intrusive, and friendly app that can be installed by anyone.\n\nAfter considering all the options, I decided to go with the snapshot-based approach. \n\nDespite being aware it’s not flawless, I believe it to be the best compromise for Sniffnet’s use case.\n\nlisteners is an open-source library I’ve been working on for the past 2 years with the goal of supporting this feature.\n\nBeing Sniffnet a cross-platform application, I needed a solution that could work on different Operating Systems:\nno other Rust crate provides this functionality supporting multiple platforms and the existing ones are not maintained or satisfactory enough even for a single OS.\n\nInterestingly, I also had this same need at my job, where we also wanted a Rust way to do it: this motivated me even further to contribute to the library. \n\nAfter two years, I’m happy to see that listeners was downloaded 150k times and has now multiple public dependents both on crates.io and GitHub, which means that this is a problem shared among many people.\n\nJust some days ago listeners v0.4.0 was published.\n\nI’m particularly proud of this release for at least two reasons:\n\nThanks to point 2, I now judge the library mature, fast, and reliable enough for use in Sniffnet.\n\nIf you’re a Rust developer, you’re more than welcome to contribute to the library trying to make it even faster, or adding support for more Operating Systems (Android and iOS? Why not!).\n\nSniffnet will use listeners to look up the process for each observed network connection, and will show it in the UI’s Overview and Inspect pages.\n\nAdditionally, it will use another library called picon (I’m still working on it) to retrieve app icons given their program path, showing them in the UI as well to make it easier to identify processes at a glance.\n\nThe workflow I plan to use is indeed pretty complex, including caching to minimize performance impact and retries to maximize the chances to correctly retrieve process information for a given open port.\n\nIn the flowchart below I’ve outlined a draft of the strategy I’ll adopt for Sniffnet-side implementation of the feature.\n\nI hope this post wasn’t too scary to read\nand that it gave you an idea of how much work is behind a seemingly simple feature like this.\n\nNothing worth having comes easy, someone says.",

    "fullText": "I don’t have a technical background, so I’m looking to apply for a project manager, product owner, or developer advocate type of role.\n\nI offer pro bono career coaching outside of work hours, so I interact with a lot of jobseekers on a regular basis. Over the last few months, I’ve been observing a troubling trend. Folks who are trying to transition into tech from a non-technical background have mentioned something like the above. I had a mixed reaction to hearing this. On one end, I was super happy that more people know about developer advocacy and are interested in a career in it. However, on a more troubling end, I thought to myself, “Are these folks seriously thinking of developer advocacy as an easy way in?” Folks who are new to this industry might not know much about developer advocacy. It’ll be scary, however, if the tech leadership also sees developer advocates as fluff. In this blog, I will share my thoughts and provide reasoning to make three claims:\n\nIn the foreword of Mary’s book, Jono Bacon wrote:\n\nDeveloper Relations … is a remarkably nuanced, complex, and context-specific discipline.\n\nI know I’m making three absolute claims without the comfort of an “it depends” answer. That is because I’ll set the context and boundary for each of my claims. Grab your favorite beverage, relax, and read on. This one doesn’t come with a TL;DR.\n\nSince some of my readers might not know about developer advocacy, this section introduces the terminology. Feel free to skip this section if you’re familiar with the role.\n\nThere are many right ways and only one wrong way to understand the different components of Developer Relations (DevRel). The only way to go wrong is to become obsessed with how different companies structure and view their DevRel teams. For example, Developer Relations - The Book breaks down DevRel into four functional areas: developer marketing, developer experience, developer education, and developer success. On the other hand, developer experience is a superset of developer relations, according to Lee Robinson at Vercel or Milen Dyankov at AxonIQ. Developer relations can report to the engineering organization, such as Google, the product or marketing organization, such as AWS, or remain separate, such as Microsoft. All this to say that the definition and structure of developer relations can vary a lot.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, the role and work of a developer advocate can be universally defined regardless of the company or the position in an org chart. A developer advocate is an experienced engineer who acts as a trusted voice between the company and the community/customer. They write clean code, produce reusable and developer-friendly content, and possess a tremendous level of empathy for the community. They can work as part of a developer relations team or as the solo developer advocate for their company. There are three important pieces in my definition of a developer advocate:\n\nIn the following three sections, I will discuss the reasoning behind my definition.\n\nIn Canada, the term “engineer” is protected and reserved only for those licensed by a provincial or territorial engineering regulator. Let’s use the term “builder” instead. A builder is someone who has experience building software systems.\n\nDeveloper advocates are storytellers. Oftentimes, these stories are about their own experiences solving critical technical challenges. Even when they’re building a demo application, their previous experience as builders helps them architect the application to follow the best practices. Most talks follow a question/answer period where the audience asks the developer advocate questions about the technology they talked about. Even if someone (without the technical foundation) manages to rehearse and deliver a technical talk, answering the audience’s deep technical questions will be extremely difficult.\n\nIf you think that not all developer advocates need to be technical and that some folks might be more on the community side, you might be mixing community managers with developer advocates. Community managers are also part of a developer relations team, and their work overlaps some of the work of developer advocates in the community. If you see a developer advocate doing only community work and no code or technical content, they may be using the incorrect title for whatever reason. On LinkedIn, I saw a sales representative with the title “Sales Rep / Developer Advocate.”\n\nWhat do I mean by “code or technical contents”? In the current time and market, almost everyone at a tech company can talk technical. Even basic knowledge of git and GitHub are considered general skills. You must return to your audience—the developers—to find the bar of code and technical content. Developers have an uncanny ability to smell sales and marketing tactics. However, they constantly seek technical knowledge from blogs and (reluctantly) skim through developer documentation. Your developer audience is the litmus test for the code and contents your developer advocate creates. Your developer advocate should somehow make developers’ lives easier through advocacy and content creation.\n\nWhy am I trying to be a gatekeeper, though? I don’t think anyone can/should be a gatekeeper in tech, but my opinions in this blog are coming from a genuine concern that some folks might be devaluing the developer advocacy role. When I was interviewing for my first job change after 8 years in 2020, I was fortunate to receive a flood of emails for DevRel roles. Unfortunately, a good percentage of these roles were for blockchain/crypto/NFT companies. What’s unfortunate about it?\n\nI respect all technologies and legal companies. Here is the unfortunate bit ➡️ Almost every single recruiter from these companies assured me that I didn’t need to know ANYTHING about blockchain or the underlying technology to join their companies. This is after I mentioned that I don’t have a clue about blockchain. What was important for these companies then? A large social media following and the ability to create endless marketing contents. I don’t follow that industry, but I can make a guess that without the technical foundation, most of the blockchain/crypto/NFT DevRel hires were unsuccessful at building the trust of their communities.\n\nDo you have a favorite developer advocate? I follow and respect a number of developer advocates in the industry. Let’s take a look at their background and try to deduce if a technical background is needed or not to become a successful developer advocate.\n\nI hope I was able to explain why developer advocacy is and will remain a highly technical role.\n\nBefore I transitioned into tech, I worked as an electrical engineer building renewable energy systems. I also spent 10 years at engineering schools in two countries, where my brain was hammered to learn new things by reading documentation (a.k.a. books), and then I built systems (a.k.a. lighting up an LED) using that knowledge. Even with all that technical experience, it would be impossible for me to start my tech career as a developer advocate. I knew a lot about circuits, diodes, and huge transformers but nothing about SQL or git, let alone cloud and Kubernetes. I started as an intern at IBM, worked my way up as a Java developer, and then transitioned to technical consulting. After 4 years of experience as a developer and consultant, I was able to start my developer advocacy career.\n\nYour path can be very different. You can be a CS grad or a college dropout, a physics PhD or a musician - but you need the experience of building software systems before trying to teach others how to do so. Whether it’s for two years or twenty, legacy enterprise development or freelance open-source contributions, a developer advocate must have done the thing that they are hoping to teach others. Without the technical experience, how can you teach a bunch of techies? Angie Jones writes:\n\nDeveloper advocates have to build and maintain credibility with their engineering peers, understand their pain points, and foresee how given solutions would address their needs. Without engineering experience, this is hard to do. Not impossible, but definitely hard.\n\nDoes DevRel look glamorous from the outside? The travel, staying at nice hotels, and “influence” on social media might send all the wrong signals to someone looking to break into tech. Maybe we should talk more about the invisible hard stuff on the job. When I’m in my hotel room, I’m practicing in front of a mirror for my talk the next morning and not sipping on a pina colada by the pool. I’ve spent countless nights at airports and on economy flights without much sleep. I’ve had layovers at airports without a proper restaurant and survived on granola bars and Coke Zero. On economy flights, wearing N95 masks can be anything but glamorous.\n\nTaylor Barnett wrote on Twitter about her hypothesis on why companies with new DevRel programs are hiring inexperienced folks. She mentioned that this is dangerous to the person they are hiring (more likely to leave the field), dangerous to the industry, and just dangerous to the company’s success. On her blog, Taylor wrote about the challenges of DevRel. Although aimed at solo DevRels, developer advocates in general, are likely to burn out due to unclear prioritization and a lack of support/understanding from the larger teams (marketing, engineering, product, etc.). This likelihood of burnout increases by a few magnitudes if this DevRel person is an intern or have very little experience.\n\nThere can be a handful of exceptions, like Twilio back in the day or GitHub in the present, where they had/have programs to hire, support, and grow junior DevRel talents. But this is an exception, not an excuse, for companies to hire cheap DevRel talent and then set them up for failure. How is this dangerous for the company and the industry? This question creates a nice segue to my final claim. More on that in the next section.\n\n2022 was a troubling year for tech. However, with all the mass layoffs, don’t associate the troubling trend of DevRel layoffs only with mass layoffs. DevRel layoffs happened this year, the year before, and the year before. In my observations, there are three main reasons behind DevRel layoffs:\n\nWhen the company needs to tighten the belt, only the folks directly contributing to the revenue make the cut, and their colleagues find a place on the chopping board. I will be out of my mind to say that a company should let go of a developer over a developer advocate. Mass layoffs are unsightly and brutal, and they frequently result from Silicon Valley’s rush to become the next unicorn. But that is sometimes the unfortunate reality and cannot be avoided.\n\nDevRel - for every developer, not for every company\n\nWhy do you think you need a developer relations team? Did you get Series A funding, and one of the investors suggested you get one of those developer advocate things? The question to ask is pretty simple. Does your company have a product or (open-source) project whose users are developers? For example, Gmail is used by the general population, but Google Cloud is used by developers.\n\nOnce you’re convinced that you need a developer advocate, or a DevRel team, it’s paramount to hire the first DevRel at the right time. Adam FitzGerald, Vice President of Developer Relations at HashiCorp, mentioned to GGV that the right time to formally create a developer relations program is when your company has about 25-50 people. Adam added that by the time your company has 100 employees, you almost certainly should have a head of developer relations, if you don’t already. While this is not exact science, this formula has worked well for many companies, including HashiCorp, which is considered the poster child for building successful open-source and developer relations programs.\n\nIn the majority of failed DevRel cases, the company leadership failed to understand the value of DevRel. When the pandemic hit in early 2020, I was working as a developer advocate at IBM. With all of the in-person conferences and meetups being cancelled, IBM leadership might have thought, “No events == No need for DevRel”. Many of our DevRel peers were let go, and the remaining were forced to move into some sort of client engineering roles. At the time of writing this blog, Grace Jansen and JJ Asghar might be the last two DevRel standing at IBM. That, too, is probably because of how insanely awesome they are at their advocacy work. I can write a book on my lessons from the IBM DevRel days, but let’s set that aside for now.\n\nMajority of companies layer DevRel on top of marketing as a sort of afterthought, and that’s usually a recipe for failure. All four co-founders at Aiven (the company where I work at) have been long-time open-source maintainers/contributors and highly value the work of DevRel. Similar examples can be seen at HashiCorp, where co-founder Armon Dadgar has been doing DevRel on the whiteboard since the early days of the company. Technical founders know the value of DevRel and know when to form a DevRel team. This is very different from bringing your first DevRel hire onboard and making them convince the leadership why the company needs DevRel in the first place. If your developer advocate needs to explain to the technical leadership the need for DevRel, that’s a red flag for that individual and the company.\n\nIf you’re trying to transition into DevRel without technical experience, kudos to you for making this decision. But please don’t think of DevRel as a shortcut into a career in tech. Gain some experience building software systems, try to walk in the shoes of developers, and understand the pain points. There will be a time when you feel confident enough to make the move. Till then, work on your public speaking and writing skills.\n\nIf you’re hiring for DevRel talent, you’re paying a premium salary equivalent to the same level on the engineering ladder. You are completely justified in questioning this cost. What value is DevRel bringing? DevRel is the only team at your company that can speak the engineer’s language, provide regular feedback to the product team, function as a marketing team, and grow the community as the face of your company. Read the last line again and again until you realize why DevRel and developer advocates are worth every penny you invest in them.",

    "fullText": "I wrote previously that the bottleneck in AI-assisted programming is shifting from individual productivity to coordination. I’ve spent the past several months building a tool to address that.\n\nBeadHub is an open-source coordination server that lets AI programming agents claim work, talk to each other, reserve files, and escalate to humans—across machines and across programmers. I use it daily to manage around fifteen agents working on two or three products.\n\nAround the time I wrote that article, I started using Steve Yegge’s beads, a git-native issue tracker designed for AI agents. Your agent runs bd create \"Fix the login redirect bug\" and it appends a JSON line to .beads/issues.jsonl, right in the repository. Issues travel with the code. When you push a branch, the issues come along.\n\nYegge calls it the “50 First Dates” problem: agents wake up every session with no memory of yesterday’s work. Beads fixes that. An agent reads the issue list and knows where things stand. My agents got much more done.\n\nWhich meant more agents, more worktrees, more parallel work—and the coordination problem became even more acute. Two agents modify the same file. One refactors a function while another adds to it. An agent picks up a task already in progress in a different worktree. Nobody knows who’s working on what.\n\nBut beads is also the right scaffolding for coordination. If everyone in a team uses beads, all agents share a picture of what needs doing. Beads gives agents something useful to talk about; BeadHub gives them a way to talk.\n\nThe major platforms are moving in this direction. Anthropic just shipped Agent Teams in Claude Code: a lead session that spawns independent teammates who communicate directly and self-coordinate. OpenAI’s Codex app runs parallel agent threads in isolated worktrees.\n\nYegge built Gas Town on top of beads to tackle the single-machine case: a “Mayor” agent orchestrates dozens of coding agents, tracks work in convoys, and persists state so agents can pick up where they left off.\n\nThese are real steps forward, but they’re solving a specific version of the problem: multiple agents for one programmer, on one machine, within one tool.\n\nThe version I am interested in is Maria in Buenos Aires running a frontend agent while Juan in San Francisco runs a backend agent, and they need their agents to not destroy each other’s work, and to figure out how to work together.\n\nBeadHub is a server that agents connect to through bdh, a wrapper around the beads bd command. When an agent runs any bdh command it registers with the server. The server tracks which agents are online across the project—what machine they’re on, what branch, what files they’re touching.\n\nCommunication. Agents can send each other mail (async, fire-and-forget) or chat (sync, block-until-reply). With mail an agent finishes a task and drops a note: “Done with bd-42, tests passing.” Chat is for when agents need to think together: “I’m adding a role field to the user model—will that break your permission checks?” / “It will, but the fix is small. Go ahead and I’ll update my side.”\n\nClaims. When an agent marks a bead as in-progress, that claim is immediately visible to every other agent in the project, regardless of whose machine they’re on. If another agent tries to claim the same bead, it gets rejected with a message telling it who has it.\n\nFile reservations. When an agent modifies a file, the server records an advisory lock. Other agents see a warning if they touch the same file. Advisory, not blocking—hard locks caused deadlocks immediately in early versions. Agent A locks file X, agent B locks file Y, both need the other’s file. Warnings work better. Agents are cooperative; they just need information.\n\nEscalation. An agent runs bdh :escalate with a description of what it’s stuck on and a human gets notified with full context. Without this, agents either fail silently or spin retrying things that need human judgment.\n\nThe multi-machine part is where it comes together. BeadHub recognizes Maria’s and Juan’s clones as the same repo. Maria’s agents and Juan’s agents see each other’s claims, locks, and messages. If Maria’s frontend agent reserves src/components/Auth.tsx, Juan’s backend agent sees the warning even though they’re in different cities on different machines.\n\nA project can span multiple repositories. The frontend repo agents can message the backend repo agents. A bead in the frontend can be marked as blocked by a bead in the backend.\n\nYou can see what this looks like in practice on the BeadHub project’s own dashboard, where we coordinate BeadHub’s development using BeadHub. Make sure to check the chat page, it is almost magical to see them figuring things out.\n\nA few things I got wrong before getting them right.\n\nThe client is the source of truth. My instinct was to make the server authoritative. But agents work locally, in git repos, and their local state is the ground truth. The server aggregates and distributes. If the server and the client disagree, the client wins. If the server goes down, bdh falls back to local bd with a warning. Work continues. Coordination catches up later.\n\nAsync by default. My first instinct was real-time negotiation between agents. Doesn’t scale. Agents work at different speeds, on different schedules, and blocking one while waiting for another is expensive. Mail is the default. Chat is the exception.\n\nAdvisory over mandatory. Advisory file locks that warn instead of block. Bead claims that can be overridden with --:jump-in \"reason\" (which notifies the other agent). The system provides information and trusts agents to act on it.\n\nThe coordinator role. I assign one agent per project the “coordinator” role. The coordinator doesn’t write code. It watches the dashboard, assigns work, checks on progress, nudges stuck agents, and keeps the end goal in sight. The implementer agents are heads-down in their worktrees; the coordinator is the one who knows what the project needs next. BeadHub serves each agent a role-specific policy—markdown documents describing how agents in that role should behave—and the coordinator’s policy is fundamentally different from an implementer’s. This turned out to matter more than any of the technical decisions.\n\nThe single-machine problem is getting solved. Agent Teams, Codex—within a few weeks, running multiple agents in parallel on your laptop will be table stakes.\n\nThe multi-programmer problem is next. Five engineers, fifty agents, three repositories, two time zones. That’s where the coordination problem changes in kind, not just degree. It’s not enough that your agents can talk to each other. They need to talk to your teammate’s agents, on a different machine, in a different time zone, working on a different repo in the same project.\n\nBeadHub is open source and free for open-source projects.",

    "title": "NatWest hails progress after £1.2B spent on tech last year, but true AI",
    "description": "Bank described the last 12 months of its tech transformation as ‘the year of [AI] deployment at scale.’",
    "fullText": "NatWest bank invested £1.2bn into its information technology transformation in 2025 and saw huge productivity gains as a result, but this year will see artificial intelligence (AI) become truly transformative for customers and staff.\n\nThe bank said it has already freed up £100m in funds as a result of simplification and the use of the cloud. AI is at the centre of the bank’s plans, with 2025 seeing the technology deployed across the company “at scale”.\n\nHeadline figures for 2025 saw the bank’s software engineers generate 35% of its code through AI software development tools, all 60,000 staff given access to AI productivity software, and thousands of human hours saved. Last year, the bank also embarked on a major collaboration with AI supplier OpenAI.\n\nOther tech achievements in 2025 included the hiring of 1,000 software developers, 100 new features developed on its retail banking app, the appointment of its first chief AI research officer and the establishment of its AI research office.\n\nIn a blog post, NatWest Group CIO Scott Marcar said this year will see the bank take advantage of the AI “building blocks” deployed last year.\n\n“The only certainty is that how customers bank will look very different in the future,” he said. “That’s why being closer to them, with insight and trust, matters more than ever. As technology reshapes how people live, work and bank, we’ve put in place the building blocks to understand, respond to and serve customers’ fast evolving needs,” wrote Marcar.\n\n“Last year brought AI deployment at scale across NatWest, and as we move into 2026, the transformative benefits are becoming more of a reality for our customers and colleagues – delivering growth, greater productivity, and, most importantly, deepening relationships – so that we can be a trusted partner for tomorrow’s banking,” he added.\n\nFrom a staff perspective, all staff now have access to AI tools including Microsoft Copilot Chat and the bank’s internal large language model (LLM), with more than half reported to have taken additional training.\n\nAccording to the bank, more than 70,000 hours were saved through automated AI call summaries in its retail business, while relationship managers in its wealth business were able to spend 30% more time on customer conversations by using AI. According to NatWest, through agentic and voice AI, customers will receive “more intuitive, personalised and seamless interactions” this year.\n\nIn the next few months, 25,000 NatWest customers will have access to its agentic financial assistant within Cora, its customer-facing agentic AI assistant. “Underpinned by OpenAI models, customers will be able to ask natural language questions about their recent spending, in their own words, on their app,” said the bank.\n\nThe bank will then experiment with voice-to-voice AI capability, which aims to provide “human-like empathy, tone and inflection”.\n\nAs part of its wider multi-year digital transformation, NatWest has added around 6,000 tech staff since 2021. In 2025 alone, it recruited 1,000 software engineers through its India Hub in Bengaluru.

    "description": "After rapid advances thanks to one-shot decompilation, progress on the Snowboard Kids 2 decompilation began to falter. This post explores the workflow evolution, tooling improvements, and fundamental LLM limits that emerged when tackling the long tail of increasingly difficult functions.",
    "fullText": "In my previous posts, I described how coding agents could be used to decompile Nintendo 64 games and that one-shot decompilation was very effective. That approach allowed me to make rapid progress on the Snowboard Kids 2 decompilation, with the percentage of matched code quickly growing from around 25% to 58%.\n\nAfter that, progress slowed dramatically, requiring me to significantly alter my workflow. With those changes, I pushed the decompilation into the ~75% range before stalling out again, this time perhaps for good, though I would love to be proved wrong.\n\nThis post describes how my workflow has evolved as the project matured, what helped, and where I’m currently stuck. My hope is that these observations will be useful for other decompilation projects.\n\nDecompilation attempts take time and tokens, so the choice of which unmatched functions to work on matters a great deal. My original approach prioritised functions based on estimated difficulty. A logistic regression model ranked candidates using features like instruction count and control-flow complexity, and Claude would always attempt the ’easiest’ remaining function. That worked remarkably well early on, but it eventually ran out of steam. At some point, everything left was hard. Reordering the queue didn’t magically make those functions easier.\n\nAt the same time, Macabeus was exploring function similarity via text embeddings of assembly instructions, which then allowed querying for nearby functions in the high-dimensional latent space. This seemed promising. Claude’s output already hinted that it could recognise similar functions and reuse patterns across them. The intuition here is that decompiled functions provide a useful reference to Claude for how particular blocks of assembly can be mapped to C code.\n\nTo test this out, I wrote a tool to compute similar matched functions given an unmatched function and adjusted the agent loop to prioritise functions with similar (matched) counterparts. This approach proved highly effective. There were indeed many similar functions that Claude hadn’t previously been able to identify, and these proved invaluable for helping guide its decompilation attempts.\n\nVector embeddings are just one way of computing function similarity. They are great for fast retrieval across huge corpora, which is one reason they’re common in RAG systems. But I only had a few thousand candidates, and queries weren’t time-sensitive. Computing exact similarity between every pair of candidates is not only feasible but preferable, given how much time and tokens are already invested in each attempt.\n\nMy first attempt was to build a composite similarity score by hand. I combined:\n\nIn hindsight, this was probably overcomplicated. There is already a tool that does something very similar: Coddog. Instead of feature engineering, it computes a bounded Levenshtein distance directly over opcode sequences, with aggressive early exits when similarity is impossible. The result is normalised to a similarity score between 0 and 1.\n\nOn the remaining unmatched functions, Coddog and my own approach select different most-similar candidates in 90.6% of cases. I still use both. They were not evaluated on identical sets of functions, so it is difficult to say whether one is strictly better or whether they are simply complementary. Anecdotally, though, the simpler approach performs at least as well as my more elaborate one.\n\nSpecialised tooling can make a big difference to Claude’s performance. The project uses a number of Claude skills but two were particularly notable: gfxdis.f3dex2 and decomp-permuter.\n\nThe N64 has a dedicated graphics chip, the Reality Display Processor (RDP). Games execute microcode on the RDP to render graphics on the screen.\n\nGames have considerable flexibility in how they use the RDP, but most opt for an off-the-shelf library provided by Nintendo. If your game doesn’t do this, you need to reverse engineer a company’s idiosyncratic microcode in addition to the game itself. Thankfully, Snowboard Kids 2 opted for a Nintendo library, specifically F3Dex2.\n\nAfter loading their desired microcode library, games send instructions to the RDP via display lists. Conceptually, display lists are just arrays of bytes representing microcode instructions, but they’re a headache for decompilers. Games often build them dynamically using macros that may invoke other macros or perform complex bit arithmetic. The compiler then optimises and reorganises this logic, making it difficult to discern what the original developers actually wrote.\n\nAgents are smart, but this is a highly domain-specific and context-specific scenario. It’s a clear use case for a Claude skill.1 I provided Claude with a reference for F3Dex2 commands, a tool to disassemble hex values into specific commands (gfxdis.f3dex2), and some strategies for handling more specific edge cases such as aggregate commands. Unsurprisingly, this made Claude far more effective at recognising and decompiling F3Dex2 code.\n\nClaude is slow and deliberate. Turning a 99.9% match into 100% can involve thousands of tiny variations in control flow, temporaries, or expression ordering. A permuter is the opposite. It blindly tries millions of small mutations in the hope that one of them produces a perfect match.\n\nIn theory, this should complement an LLM nicely. Claude does the structured reasoning, the permuter brute-forces the final few percent. The skill enforced this split by allowing the permuter to run only once a function was already more than 95% matched.\n\nPermuters happily introduce strange code: illogical variable reuse, do {} while (0) loops, nested assignments. Sometimes these changes work. Often they do not. Worse, they optimise for incremental improvements to the match percentage rather than for correctness. A small reordering might delete a function call or subtly change register allocation in a way that improves the match. But if that call existed in the original, you will have to restore it eventually. You are not actually closer to a clean match. You have just moved the compiler into a more convenient shape.\n\nClaude, unfortunately, tended to treat these artefacts as signal. It would start optimising around permuter-induced noise, leading to doom loops and token burn with little real progress.\n\nAfter a few attempts to rein this in, I removed the permuter entirely. The occasional win did not justify the cleanup cost or the instability it introduced. It also made manual intervention harder, since the codebase would drift into awkward, overfitted forms that no human would willingly write.\n\nCleaning up and documenting code doesn’t directly improve the match rate but it can help reach previously unmatchable functions. Many of the earlier functions (particularly those done by Claude) were quite brittle. They technically matched, but relied on pointer arithmetic, awkward temporaries, or control flow no human would willingly write. Those matches worked, but they were poor references when an unmatched function was later identified as similar to them.\n\nCleaner, more idiomatic matches make better examples once similarity-based scheduling kicks in. If a function really should be using array indexing instead of pointer math, fixing that improves the signal Claude sees when attempting related code.\n\nSometimes this cleanup was done by hand but Claude was also reasonably good at cleaning up its own work. Claude was run in a loop, similar to the technique used for one-shot decompilation, where it was tasked with making changes to one individual function at a time.\n\nThis was another area where the right skills made a difference. In a decompilation project, even renaming a global variable can involve multiple steps. This also turned out to be a great way to document the structure of the project, since writing down how everything worked was already necessary for Claude’s benefit.\n\nAs a side effect, this work turned up some genuinely fun discoveries. While documenting the cheat code system, I stumbled across a previously unknown cheat code. That alone justified the detour.\n\nThe ongoing decompilation work plus the branching into other non-decompilation tasks presented numerous challenges in terms of resources, project stability, and task orchestration.\n\nFour changes helped me keep the workflow scaling:\n\nThese will be discussed in turn.\n\nThere are multiple tasks that we need to perform. Worktrees are the recommended way to run multiple agents on a single codebase. Agents need their own version of the codebase to work with, or we risk conflicting changes, errors, and so on.\n\nToday I run agents across three separate worktrees in addition to the main branch, where I do human stuff.\n\nGreater automation of the decompilation and documentation work also increased the possibility of Claude creating and committing mistakes. The unsupervised nature of the work means these can lie undetected for hours, potentially invalidating all the intervening work that has been done.\n\nIn one particularly amusing case, Claude couldn’t get a function to match, so it updated the SHA1 hash that was used for comparison between the compiled artefact and the original ROM. All work done after that point had to be reverted.\n\nHooks proved invaluable for preventing this behaviour and guiding the agent. Hooks allow us to run code before the agent takes a specific action, for example when editing a file. I’ve found them incredibly useful. You can find the full list of hooks here. Currently, I use hooks to:\n\nHooks have significantly reduced the frequency with which Claude attempts misguided or destructive actions, though they are not perfect. Claude can be very persistent when it really wants to do something. I’ve seen Claude run the contents of a make command when make itself is blocked, or write a Python script to edit a file it’s been told it can’t edit. But hooks at least offer better enforcement than prompting alone.\n\nDifferent kinds of long-running agent loops have become essential to my workflow. The increased use of long-running tasks also required a more robust solution than my old run.py script. I decided to split my old run.py script (now Nigel) into its own repo.\n\nNigel reflects the immediate needs of the decompilation project but might be useful more generally. In Nigel, tasks are expressed via configuration: it’s easy to experiment with new ideas by copying an existing task and tweaking it. In your configuration file, you need to specify a ‘candidate source’ (input to the task) and a prompt (which can optionally be a separate template file).\n\nHere’s an example from my recent attempts to remove hard-coded hex addresses in main.c:\n\nNigel will automatically discover scripts (uniquely identified by name) and can run them with proper handling to ensure the same input isn’t handled twice, good changes are committed, failures are handled gracefully, etc.\n\nSome of my favourite Nigel features are:\n\nIt’s hard to discuss Claude workflows without mentioning Ralph Wiggum. Like Ralph, Nigel can repeatedly prompt Claude with the same task via --repeat until it succeeds. The difference is that Nigel operates within structured workflows and batch jobs. Tasks generate candidates and consume them one at a time, whereas Ralph simply replays the same prompt.\n\nMy initial prompt capped the number of attempts at 30 to preserve tokens, which may have been conservative.\n\nI experimented with relaxing this limit and enabling --repeat 3. A small number of functions exceeded the previous 30-attempt cap. One required 87 attempts before Claude finally succeeded.\n\nIn practice, higher --repeat values do help, but only at the extreme tail and at considerable token cost.\nThe 85th percentile of successful attempts remains 28 attempts, meaning most functions complete within the original limit. For now, I’ve removed --repeat 3 while leaving the number of attempts within a single prompt uncapped. That preserves headroom for rare outliers without multiplying token usage across the entire workload.\n\nWork on the remaining unmatched functions required more attempts, more intermediate output, and more refactoring passes. An unattended Opus task could burn through the Claude 20x Max plan in a matter of days. The new cleanup and documentation loops only added to the pressure on a finite token budget.\n\nGLM, an open-weight model from z.ai, is generally considered less capable than Opus. But it’s dramatically cheaper, offers generous token limits, and can act as a drop-in replacement for most of my workflows.\n\nThus glaude was born: a thin wrapper that looks like Claude but quietly points at a GLM backend.\n\nI usually try glaude first, or reach for it when I know the task is mechanical. Cleanup passes, refactors, documentation loops: none of these really need frontier reasoning. I’d rather preserve Opus tokens for the genuinely difficult work. It’s not perfect. Opus has cracked problems GLM couldn’t. But it lets me run agents without constantly worrying about weekly quotas, which makes the whole system far more sustainable.\n\nAfter all that engineering (similarity scoring, skills, hooks, orchestration, model routing), the curve ultimately flattened in early January. At that point, 157 functions remained. With continued work, that’s now down to 124, but the dynamic has fundamentally changed.\n\nNigel the cat is still as busy as ever. There’s still work to be done, but matching functions has become much harder. At least until the next wave of frontier models is released.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you probably have an interest in decompilation and Snowboard Kids 2. Check out the Snowboard Kids 2 decompilation project, and please reach out on Discord if you’d like to help.\n\nYou can also follow me on Bluesky for more Snowboard Kids 2 updates.\n\nI’ve gone back and forth between treating this as a Claude skill vs making it directly part of the CLAUDE.md for the decomp environment. As I was writing this blog post though, it did seem a little embarrassing not making it a skill, so I changed it back. 😶‍🌫️ ↩︎",

    "title": "The 10 most dangerous aircraft ever made",
    "description": "Some of the military aircraft featured here were more dangerous for their pilots than their enemies",
    "fullText": "They managed to sneak through the design and testing stages without all their vulnerabilities being discovered and it’s left to the crew, and in some cases passengers, to deal with the often tragic fallout.\n\nThe aircraft listed here were, with one exception, more dangerous than they should have been, but in most cases, this was also a sign of the period in which they were operating.\n\nFor example, entries 2-10 could have been filled with jet fighters from the 1950s and 60s which probably would have been more statistically accurate, but would also have got a bit predictable. Regardless, here are ten aircraft you probably should avoid flying:\n\nEntering service during the British Comet’s awkward pause in operations the Soviet Tu-104 was the world’s only jet airliner for a brief period. What it wasn’t was particularly safe. The controls were heavy, it was unstable, and the highly swept wings had adverse handling characteristics approaching the stalling speed. These quirks might be acceptable in a strategic bomber but were not ideal in an airliner.\n\nThe tendency to pitch up violently, or enter an uncontrollable dive at the stall led to pilots flying the approach into airports 30mph faster than the intended speed often creating problems that the brake chute couldn’t solve. 1958 saw three aircraft lost in accidents with subsequent years seeing a steady drum beat of losses.\n\n32 aircraft were lost in accidents before the type was withdrawn from commercial use, while another aircraft was hit by a missile after a training exercise went awry. Aeroflot withdrew the Tu-104 in 1979 after a false fire alarm led to an aircraft crashing while returning to Moscow airport, killing 58 of 119 onboard. The Russian military continued using the type until 1981 when a Soviet Navy example crashed due to improper loading of cargo, killing 16 Admirals in the process.\n\nWith 201 aircraft built the Tu-104 suffered a loss rate of 16%, better than the next entry but substantially worse than just about any other operational jet airliner.\n\nAfter years of wartime austerity, the de Havilland Comet showed the world that Britain was still at the cutting edge of civil aviation. The world’s first jet-powered airliner entered service with BOAC in 1952 heralding a golden future. Unfortunately, that never arrived.\n\nOn 26 October 1952, a BOAC aircraft ran off the runway at Rome’s Ciampino airport refusing to leave the ground despite the nose being held in the air. Four months later a Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet taking off from Karachi did the same, killing all 11 onboard. Ultimately a modification to the wing leading edge would solve the problem but much worse was to come.\n\nIn January 1954, Comet G-ALYP disintegrated over the Mediterranean killing all onboard. After a brief investigation, the Comet was returned to flight in March. Two weeks later G-ALYY would disappear near Naples. The Comet’s Certificate of Airworthiness was revoked, and a thorough investigation began.\n\nIt was discovered that the crack that caused the first accident began at a rivet hole that had been damaged during build. The thin-gauge metal used to save weight made the early Comets vulnerable to this type of damage and a redesign was required. However the damage was done, the battle lost to the Boeing 707. 114 Comets were built, with 25 being lost.\n\nThe endurance of the Gloster Meteor, the first jet-powered fighter of the Allies, could be measured with an egg timer. Another serious issue was that an engine failure of one of the two engines on take-off could be fatal. The two engines were widely spaced out from each other causing alarmingly asymmetric thrust with one engine out. In some cases, pilots would have their own critical speed recommendation for asymmetric flight based on their leg strength. Other issues included selecting the air brakes with the undercarriage and flaps already down, the resultant blanking of airflow to the tail leading to a dive.\n\nThe limited navigation aids available at the time also caused issues, on one occasion in 1951 a flight of three aircraft from 203 Advanced Flying School at RAF Driffield found themselves having to descend over the sea to gain visual flight conditions.\n\nThe full list of Meteor crashes is astonishing and not only was the aircraft ridden with dangerous design features, it was a new type of aeroplane requiring new skills to many pilots more familiar with piston-engined aircraft. 1952 alone saw 150 Meteors lost in RAF service, 30% of losses for that year, the next highest figure being for Vampires with a ‘mere’ 82 being lost.\n\nThe following year saw a slight easing off with only 143 Meteors lost. In total the RAF alone lost 890 Meteors, accounting for 22% of the production run.\n\nThe Vought Cutlass still looks like it came from the future today. Unfortunately, it’s a future with a very relaxed approach to safety. A lack of thrust was one flaw; a complicated high-pressure hydraulic system was another. In the F7U-1 failure of this could leave the pilot with no control for 11 seconds while pressure decreased enough for manual control to be taken. A third weak point was the fragile nose gear.\n\nAs if having the cockpit 14 feet off the ground at a 9 degrees attitude wasn’t enough for landing and taxiing it was raised to 14 degrees, and in a foreshadowing of the Phantom a full 20 degrees for take-off. Unfortunately, this made the whole spindly assembly liable to collapse on landing, or worse punching up through the cockpit floor into the bottom of the ejection seat causing it to fire.\n\nAs a carrier aircraft, its greatest weakness, of many, was the 23-degree nose-high attitude on approach which essentially guaranteed that if you could see the ship you were doing it wrong. A design flaw meant that while in afterburner the transfer tank that fed fuel to the engines could be drained faster than it was being replenished from the rest of the system.\n\nUnsurprisingly the Cutlass was withdrawn from fleet operations by October 1957, only three and a half years after entering service, although some would remain in second-line use until March 1959 primarily for trial work. 78 of 320 Cutlasses were lost in accidents in only 55,000 flying hours making it one of the most dangerous US Navy jets of all time. Still, that’s amateur hour compared to the next entry.\n\nThe B-24 Liberator was one of the best heavy bombers of the Second World War, and in its Anti Submarine Warfare variants was responsible for sinking more submarines than any other aircraft in history. The C-87 transport version would enjoy none of its siblings’ success. To make a C-87 the bomb bay was converted into a cargo area along with the fuselage forward of the cockpit. Able to carry up to 25 passengers or 12,000lbs (5455kg) of cargo the Liberator Express was an improvement on the existing C-47.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the priority given to its bomber cousin shortcuts were taken in the C-87’s production.\n\nThe use of a lower boost supercharger adversely affected its high-altitude performance. The nose gear was prone to breaking, having not been intended for landings with a full internal load. Cargo was also liable to shift throwing the centre of gravity out of limits, causing the aircraft to climb or dive uncontrollably. In the book, ‘Fate is the Hunter’ author and pilot Ernest K Gann details the C-87’s faults, including the time he nearly destroyed the Taj Mahal after taking off in a C-87 with three tonnes more fuel than expected.\n\nThe C-87’s loss rate was over 50% with 152 of 287 lost. In comparison, despite regularly being engaged in air-to-air combat, only around 33% of Liberators were lost.\n\nThe Latécoère 631 was the ultimate in late ‘30s flying boats with six engines, twin tails, and a bar in the nose, unfortunately, the second world war would delay its service entry to 1946. Before this, the first example had been commandeered by the Luftwaffe, and then sunk at its moorings by the RAF. In October 1945 the second aircraft was flying between Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo when the number 3 propeller broke off.\n\nOne blade hit the number 2 engine's propeller and another ripped through the fuselage killing two passengers. Air France continued its operations and it wasn’t until February 1948 when a brand new 631 crashed into the English Channel in bad weather.\n\nAugust 1948 saw aircraft F-BDRC disappear over the Atlantic. Air France took the opportunity to cancel its orders while the French government created a company to use the remaining examples for cargo.  Meanwhile, F-WANU was used to discover what had led to F-BDRC’s loss, leading to it too crashing. Another company was now formed to use two of the remaining 631s for cargo operations. When one of these broke up in a thunderstorm over Cameroon in 1955 operations finally stopped.\n\nFour of seven Latécoère 631s were lost in accidents with all onboard dying, making it one of the more dangerous airliners ever to fly; a further four 631 planes were never even used.\n\nThe Crusader was a handful, which was painfully apparent when it came to landing, a terrible quality in a carrier aircraft. A terrifying total of 493 Crusader pilots had to exit the aircraft by ejection seat. Overall, 517 of the 1261 Crusaders had been built had been lost. This loss rate of 41% is dismal, and that there is 737 entries in the Aviation Safety Network database is clearly atrocious.\n\nThe high approach speed of 147 knots was a big issue on smaller carriers such as the Essex-class. Consistent speed was also important. To help, an autothrottle (Approach Power Compensator) was added in 1964, but even this caused problems as over-reliance on the APC was equally dangerous. Another peculiarity of the F-8 was its odd relationship between nose attitude and sink rate caused by its oddest design feature, on landing the wing stayed at the same angle of attack as the fuselage tilted (the wing was mounted on a mechanism).\n\nThings were particularly counter-intuitive for the pilot in the final approach stages, which again required attention. The Crusader, fine in many ways, was an extremely dangerous aeroplane.\n\nThe Supermarine Scimitar was a twin-jet naval fighter from the manufacturers of the Spitfire. Despite having two engines each producing 11,000lbs of thrust, the overly thick wing, prevented it being supersonic in anything other than a dive. It also suffered a horrendous loss rate. For a naval aircraft surprisingly few of its accidents directly involved an aircraft carrier. Two suffered cable breaks after landing and fell off the front of the ship.\n\nA third suffered brake failure while taxiing to the catapult, while a fourth ditched after an aborted landing. A fifth aircraft suffered an engine failure on approach.\n\nScimitars also suffered nine losses due to hydraulic failures, 5 due to engine failures, a couple each due to bird strikes, fuel leaks, or Controlled Flight into Terrain. There were also 7 losses for unknown reason. In an unusual twist, two of the three surviving Scimitars were involved in a mid-air collision over Malta in April 1964 when 807 squadron was on its way back from the Far East.\n\nOverall of 76 Scimitars built, 39 were lost in accidents - a staggering 51%  - all essentially in peacetime: the closest they came to a war was deterring an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1961.\n\nThe Republic F-105 Thunderchief had an auspicious start to life with the first two prototypes breaking their backs in landing accidents. Given the airframe needed a complete redesign to reach the contracted top speed this was probably less of a problem than it at first seemed. However, it wasn’t an encouraging sign when after all the modifications to achieve that were done the third prototype very nearly did the same thing. In this case the main gear refused to extend as the engine auxiliary intakes, located in the gear bay, had opened and the suction from the Pratt and Whitney J-75s was holding the doors firmly shut.\n\nIn a cruel twist with the engine shut down the test pilot was walking away from the aircraft only for it to slowly hoist itself up onto its wheels, the hydraulics being able to overcome gravity if not vacuums.\n\nAside from the excessive heat and humidity requiring modification to the Thunderchief the single hydraulic system controlling the horizontal stabiliser soon emerged as a weak point.  Damage to the system would force the aircraft into an irrecoverable dive - F-105s were also falling to North Vietnamese air defences, primarily guns, at a shocking rate. At least 60 were lost in 1965, 111 in 1966, and a further 97 in 1967. In all 334 Thunderchiefs were lost in combat over Vietnam nearly 20% of USAF losses and 40% of all F-105s produced.\n\nEven in the context of war, this was bad when compared to loss rates for aircraft in WW2. A further 63 were lost in accidents in South East Asia while when other losses are included well over 50% of all Thunderchiefs produced were lost.\n\nBuilt by the Imperial Japanese Navy’s Yokosuka arsenal, the MXY-7 Ohka suicide bomb was a 20 foot tube with stub wings. The doomed pilot was sandwiched between a 1200kg warhead and a 4500 pound thrust rocket motor. Surprisingly, there was armour plating at the rear of the cockpit to protect the pilot. Despite a top speed of over 500mph, the Ohka was not the highly effective weapon that had been hoped for.\n\nKamikaze attacks in converted fighters had shown limited success but the MXY-7 had an Achilles heel. Its limited range required it to be carried to the target by a converted G4M ‘Betty’ bomber.\n\nCarrying the Ohka compromised the G4M’s speed, and its ceiling was reduced to a dangerously low 16,400 feet. On their first mission on 21 March 1945, all the bombers were intercepted before they were within 50 miles of their target. Although some MXY-7s were released, with a range of only 20 miles it would be to no effect. The Ohka’s performance didn’t improve, only one ship, the destroyer USS Mannert L Abele was sunk by the MXY-7, with 84 sailors believed killed. Given there were 74 MXY-7 missions, and the Betty itself had a crew of seven, it’s entirely possible more Japanese lives were lost in Ohka missions than American. Quite how a suicide aircraft could be even more dangerous than it was intended to be is a grim and perplexing question…\n\nJoe Coles is the author of The Hush-Kit Book of Warplanes Vol 1.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please click the Follow button above to see more like it from Autocar",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates, which are as low as they've been in years. Shop for your best rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nCurrent mortgage rates are dipping into territory that hasn't been seen in years. According to the Zillow lender marketplace, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.85%. The 15-year fixed rate is 5.36%. At this level, homebuyers and mortgage refinancers may be jumping into an loan application soon.\n\nMORE: 6% or less — See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.85%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 5.85% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,770, and you’d pay $337,136 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.36% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.36% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,429. But you’d only pay $137,224 in interest over the life of the loan. That's a sizable savings.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate will go up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 5.85%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.36%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 5.81%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 5.85%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. Zillow's rates are usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere. Each source compiles rates using different methods. Zillow obtains rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nAccording to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.1% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score. Learn how to lower your refi costs, both at closing and long term.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea.

    "title": "The US Air Force Just Banned Troops From Using This Popular New Tech",
    "description": "An updated Air Force dress code policy strictly prohibits a popular wearable device for troops. Here is why officials say the tech is a security risk.",
    "fullText": "The United States military is among the largest and most technologically sophisticated in the world. Needless to say, it has access to some extraordinary equipment, with the U.S. Air Force operating some of the fastest fighter jets in service today. These are aircraft that most civilians will never ever come close to flying, but by the same token, there is some civilian technology that Air Force personnel are not permitted to use while in uniform.\n\nSmart glasses are becoming increasingly popular, with International Data Corporation noting in July 2025 that the second-generation Meta Ray-Ban glasses captured nearly two-thirds of the market after a successful end to 2024. The broader concept of smart glasses, however, touches on significant fears about privacy and security, meaning that there's a smart reason not to wear models such as Meta's AI glasses. It's also for this reason that the Air Force has prohibited the wearing of such devices. On January 9, 2026, the Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs issued new guidance targeting \"dress and personal appearance.\" The policy noted that, with regard to traditional eyewear, specific shades of frames and lenses for sunglasses and eyeglasses must be adhered to, while \"It is unauthorized to wear mirrored lenses or smart glasses with photo, video or artificial intelligence capabilities while in uniform.\"\n\nElsewhere in this memo, the iconic duty-identifier patches were brought back, powerful symbols of pride in a shared role and expertise. This same collective spirit, however, means that any Air Force member could endanger their fellow members through the use of smart glasses, which is why they were banned.\n\nIf there's one term that's pivotal to U.S. Air Force operations, it's OPSEC: Operations security. There's a wealth of information, from troop movements to the specs of particular vehicles or weapons, that could be potentially disastrous if it leaked. When smart glasses are in the picture, such a leak could occur accidentally, or even without the responsible parties knowing it happened.\n\nThis is the argument put forward by Dana Thayer, the Information Protection Chief of the 104th Fighter Wing, in a statement shared by dvids in response to this prohibition of the devices. Thayer warns that such devices can and will continue to record even when the wearer hasn't specifically set them to do so, which Thayer equates to receiving a plethora of pop-up ads about a specific product that you haven't expressly searched for online but only discussed. Imagine the conversation is about a top-secret new military operation rather than a fast-food craving, and the potential gravity of wearing smart glasses in uniform becomes obvious.\n\nAs is the case essentially anywhere AI and similar technologies are in use, there are significant advantages to be gained. Smart glasses may even serve as a viable alternative to computer monitors, for instance, increasing versatility in work environments. It's vital to be aware of the dangers too. The U.S. Army and Navy have not yet instituted such a blanket measure as an outright ban on in-uniform use of smart glasses, but perhaps they will. It's an evolving technology and an evolving situation, and the devices may find a place where their utility can be deployed, even in the most sensitive situations.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

Washington earlier this month announced it will cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, as New Delhi has agreed ‌to stop Russian oil imports.\n\nSanctioned ⁠vessels Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star, and Al Jafzia frequently changed their identities to evade law enforcement by coastal states, the source ⁠said, adding that their owners were based overseas.\n\nIndian authorities said in a post on X on February 6 that they had intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west ​of Mumbai ​after detecting suspicious activity involving a tanker ​in India's exclusive economic zone. ‌The post was later deleted, but the source now confirmed that the vessels had been escorted to Mumbai for further investigation.\n\nThe Indian Coast Guard has since deployed about 55 ships and 10 to 12 aircraft for round-the-clock surveillance in its maritime zones, according to the source.\n\nThe U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control last year ‌sanctioned the vessels Global Peace, Chil 1, and ​Glory Star 1 with IMO numbers identical to ​the ships captured by India.\n\nTwo ​of the three tankers are linked to Iran, with Al ‌Jafzia having carried fuel oil from Iran ​to Djibouti in ​2025 and Stellar Ruby flagged in Iran, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe Asphalt Star mostly operated on voyages around China, the data show.\n\nSanctioned oil and fuel ​are often sold at ‌deep discounts due to the risks involved, with intermediaries moving cargo through ​complex ownership structures, false documentation and mid-sea transfers that complicate enforcement.\n\n(Reporting ​by Saurabh Sharma; editing by Andrei Khalip)",

    "fullText": "PARIS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - French police searched the Arab World Institute in Paris on Monday as part of a ‌probe into its former head, ex-culture minister Jack Lang, and ‌his links to late convicted U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, prosecutors said.\n\nFrance's National Financial Prosecutor (PNF) said ​in a statement that the Arab World Institute was among several locations being raided.\n\nProsecutors this month opened a preliminary investigation of Lang and his daughter Caroline on suspicion of tax fraud following the release of documents on Epstein in ‌the U.S.\n\nLang, who was ⁠culture minister under late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, resigned this month from the Arab World Institute, which he had led ⁠since 2013.\n\nHe has said he was unaware of Epstein's crimes despite corresponding with him between 2012 and 2019, 11 years after the financier was convicted of soliciting ​prostitution ​from an underage girl. Epstein died in ​prison by suicide in 2019.\n\nThe ‌Institute, which is overseen by France's foreign ministry, said it could not immediately comment on the police action.\n\nBoth Jack and Caroline Lang have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and receiving financial benefits from Epstein. Their lawyer Laurent Merlet told French broadcaster BFMTV this month that \"there was no movement of funds\".\n\nFallout from ‌the release of millions of new documents ​related to Epstein has rippled through Europe. On ​Saturday, Paris prosecutors set up ​a dedicated team to review the files, coordinating with the ‌financial prosecutor and national police.\n\nThe office ​said it was ​analysing several potential cases stemming from the Epstein files.\n\nOne concerns French diplomat Fabrice Aidan, alleged to have transferred United Nations documents to Epstein.\n\nAidan, ​who worked at the ‌U.N. from July 2006 to April 2013, has rejected the accusations ​through his lawyer.",

    "fullText": "Mark Cuban expects legions of workers will be needed to implement AI at companies, creating a huge opportunity for tech-savvy young people.\n\nThe tech billionaire and former \"Shark Tank\" investor made the prediction during an August interview with TBPN, a tech talk show and podcast.\n\nAI guru Rohan Paul shared a clip of Cuban's comments over the weekend, which was widely reposted; Cuban himself shared three responses from other AI gurus on his X feed.\n\nOne declared it the \"MOST underrated clip on the internet right now.\" Another drew a parallel to Salesforce and the millions of administrative and integration roles it spawned. A third heralded a shift from generic software to customized intelligence.\n\nCuban is calling the IT services boom of the 2000s, but for intelligence instead of infrastructure. Every wave of business technology from PCs to cloud to mobile spawned a massive local services layer. The AI wave needs the same thing, and 33 million companies are waiting. \n\nThe… https://t.co/sgBXH1VJLd\n\nCuban told TBPN that when he was 24, he would walk into companies and executives would point to their secretaries and receptionists and say they didn't need a PC. Cuban recognized that as an opportunity to sell old-school bosses on the benefits of computers and teach them how to use them.\n\nHe said it's a similar situation with the latest tech wave, which some believe will render millions of human workers obsolete and trigger mass unemployment.\n\nCuban said he advises high-school and college students to not just \"learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies.\"\n\nCuban, a minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said that tens of millions of US companies don't have AI budgets or AI experts.\n\n\"This is where kids getting hired coming out of college are really going to have a unique opportunity,\" he said. They should spend their free time learning how to use different AI tools, make AI videos, and customize AI models so they can teach business leaders in any industry how to harness the tech, he added.\n\n\"That is every single job that's going to be available for kids coming out of school because every single company needs that,\" Cuban said. \"There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI and that's what people don't understand.\"\n\nCuban emphasized the opportunity isn't limited to software engineers. Many older workers are \"afraid\" to ask complex questions to AI models, he said, unlike \"kids coming out of school today that are fearless in the questions they ask and the followups and their ability to prompt.\"\n\n\"That's jobs for everybody,\" he added.",

    "description": "Yeli Heidecker and her husband built her mom a tiny home themselves to cut costs. They love the space, but they learned a few lessons along the way.",
    "fullText": "Yeli Heidecker and her husband had no experience with small spaces when they decided to build a tiny home for her mom in the fall of 2025.\n\nThey didn't let that stop them, though. The Heideckers learned on the job and, despite their inexperience, finished the build in just eight weeks. Everything worked out great — for the most part.\n\nHere are the biggest lessons Heidecker took away from building her first tiny home.\n\nHeidecker's mother had been living in an RV on the 32-year-old content creator and her husband's two-acre property in Texas when they decided to build her something more permanent.\n\nTheir solution was a tiny home — or, as they like to call it, a tiny casita — designed to be a mini version of the barndominium Heidecker and her husband live in with their four children.\n\nHeidecker said they were originally quoted between $63,000 and $97,000 to have professionals build the entire house. To cut costs, she and her husband did nearly all of the work themselves on the 400-square-foot tiny home. They only brought in an expert to build the shell and lay the concrete foundation.\n\nThey built it in just eight weeks for around $33,000, saving at least $30,000.\n\nHeidecker and her husband had never built a tiny home before taking on the project.\n\nAnd while the house has been working great for Heidecker's mom since it was mostly finished in November 2025, there are some tweaks they would consider now that they have a complete build under their belts.\n\n\"Even when you are very intentional about building something, there's going to be something that you're like, 'Man, I wish I would have done this differently,'\" Heidecker said. \"That's why you live and learn.\"\n\nThe Heideckers hired someone to build the shell of the tiny house, including the concrete foundation, since they didn't have the experience to construct it themselves.\n\nLooking back, Heidecker wishes he had either poured a thicker layer of concrete or raised the foundation so it wasn't as close to the ground.\n\n\"When we talked to the guy who built the shell for us, he said, 'This should be fine. We don't need to raise it anymore,'\" Heidecker said. \"We fell for that, and we definitely should have gone with our gut and raised the concrete more just to avoid it from flooding or anything like that.\"\n\nFlood damage is their biggest concern, but Heidecker said they worry that even watering the grass in the backyard could inadvertently lead to damage to the house. They're planning to flatten out the ground around the tiny home to protect it, but it would have been easier if it had just been positioned higher to begin with.\n\n\"It's the foundation, so it's extremely important to keep that in mind,\" she advised.\n\nAlthough the tiny home's size works for Heidecker's mother now, she thinks they should have made it a bit larger to be more functional in the long term.\n\nSpecifically, Heidecker wished the bedroom and bathroom were slightly bigger so they could be completely ADA accessible if her mom needed to use a walker or wheelchair down the line. The shower entrance was designed for accessibility, but the doorways and size of the bedroom weren't.\n\n\"It could have been like $2,000 to $3,000 more if we had gone maybe 2 feet more on each side,\" she said, which would have made the house closer to 500 square feet instead of 400.\n\nThey were trying to be budget-conscious during the project, but Heidecker thinks it would have been worth spending more money up front to avoid having to adapt the tiny home down the line.\n\nShe recommends thinking about how your tiny structure will function long-term if you're building your own.\n\nThe Heidecker family's home sits on two acres, and they built the tiny home parallel to theirs.\n\nThey like that the homes are close together, particularly because Heidecker's children often visit their grandmother. However, after they built her house, they realized it obstructed the main home's view of the sunset.\n\n\"At some point we did mention like, 'Oh man, we probably could have done it a little bit more to the left or a little bit more back for our own views,'\" she said. \"The sun sets on that side, and now the casita is right there.\"\n\nHeidecker said the obstructed view isn't a big deal, but if they were building the tiny home from scratch, they would likely place it in a slightly different spot. That could have also been beneficial if they ever want to use the space as a rental property, as it would give the renter and the Heidecker family more privacy between the two homes.\n\n\"Be extremely sure where you're going to put the unit,\" she advised.\n\nNow that she has a tiny house build under her belt, Heidecker recommends others be flexible when taking on their own projects.\n\n\"Be patient and be open to pivoting or making changes in the middle of it based on either budget or timing,\" she said. \"I think it's very important.\"\n\nFor instance, the Heidecker family's build was initially supposed to take six weeks but ended up taking eight, and they were slightly over budget.\n\nDespite the hiccups, Heidecker and her family love the tiny house, and they're proud of the results. It's working great for Heidecker's mom, and it even withstood the cold when Texas got hit with a winter storm in January.\n\n\"It worked like a champ,\" Heidecker said. \"My mom was like, 'It was so warm. It was so cozy.' I was like, 'Man, we could have just been in here all day.'\"",

    "description": "OB-GYN Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi said she's seen an uptick in younger cancer patients. She shared her best cancer prevention tips.",
    "fullText": "Over the past five to 10 years, OB-GYN Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi noticed an uptick in younger cancer patients in her practice.\n\nSuddenly, \n\nAs to the causes, Aliabadi has her own theories.\n\n\"I think our lifestyles, our metabolic changes, the rates of obesity, the increase in insulin resistance, our poor diet, lack of exercise, chronic inflammation — these have all played a huge role,\" she told Business Insider. She also mentioned environmental pollutants that can disrupt the endocrine system and the fact that women are getting pregnant later or not at all, which can change hormone exposure and increase the risk of breast cancer.\n\nIn better news, she also said higher rates of diagnoses also mean \"we've gotten better and better at cancer detection and risk assessment,\" as awareness around early symptoms have also improved.\n\nWhile so many factors can feel out of our control, \"I wish every woman knew that cancer is not always completely random,\" Aliabadi said. In some cases, \"we can actually see risk long, long before the disease appears.\"\n\nAliabadi shared her three tips for preventing cancers in women (such as breast and ovarian cancer), from analyzing your risk to focusing on your metabolic health.\n\nIn terms of overall prevention, Aliabadi said starting a few healthy habits as early as possible is key.\n\n\"If you want to lower your risk of cancer, number one on the list is to maintain a healthy metabolic profile,\" she said. It means lowering cholesterol, inflammation, and visceral fat — the fat surrounding your internal organs.\n\nShe said exercise, such as strength training and cardio, improves insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation, and balances hormones, lowering the risk of multiple cancers.\n\nEating a diet \"rich in whole foods\" and cutting back on ultra-processed foods can also make a huge difference by boosting gut health and cutting down cholesterol.\n\nOther good habits for metabolic health include stress reduction and getting adequate sleep. \"Sleep deprivation is poison to our longevity, and persistent stress can affect our hormones and our immune pathways,\" she said.\n\nThese habits don't just decrease cancer risk — they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses.\n\nAliabadi said environmental toxins, like chemicals in food packaging, can be \"a little tougher\" to be aware of because of how ubiquitous they are.\n\nHowever, there are still ways to reduce exposure to carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) and endocrine disruptors. A commonly spoken about one is tobacco, so abstaining from smoking cigarettes or vaping \"can significantly lower many cancer risks,\" she said.\n\nThe one she really emphasized cutting back on is alcohol, as even moderate drinking can increase cancer risks.\n\n\"In my office, I have zero tolerance for alcohol,\" she said. \"Not even a couple of glasses a week.\"\n\nWhile cancer screenings have recommended starting ages — some of which have been recently lowered to reflect an uptick in younger patients — Aliabadi says you shouldn't rely on them.\n\n\"We need to stop thinking that prevention starts at 40, that mammograms start at 40,\" she said. \"Prevention starts in our teens and in our 20s, believe it or not.\"\n\nShe urges women to take a two-minute online test and learn their lifetime risk assessment score for breast cancer, which uses information like family history, genetic mutations, and breast density to more accurately estimate when you should get screened. Olivia Munn, a patient of Aliabadi's, famously took the test and was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer despite having no symptoms.\n\nAliabadi said that testing for seemingly unrelated conditions, like PCOS, endometriosis, fertility, genetic conditions, and insulin resistance, can all play a role in evaluating your cancer risk and give you a better idea of how vigilant you should be.\n\nAliabadi, who herself had a high lifetime risk assessment score for breast cancer and was initially dismissed by doctors, said a patient knowing their body helps them better advocate for themselves and seek out second opinions if needed.\n\n\"If someone at the front desk tries to scare her away, she will be her own health advocate,\" Aliabadi said. \"She will know exactly why she's there and why she needs that mammogram.\"",

    "description": "I moved to New York City to pursue a career in fashion journalism. After a few years at my \"dream job,\" I felt burned out and had to redefine success.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I heard Taylor Swift's \"Welcome to New York\" for the first time, the city called my name.\n\nOf course, I was grateful for my suburban upbringing in California, but my town was too small for my aspirations. I wanted to live the life of a fashion journalist, and to me, that required being in New York City.\n\nFixated on my goal, I mapped out a plan in college to secure as many internships and part-time writing gigs as possible, then fling the industry door wide open.\n\nI went on to land a job at a Los Angeles public relations agency before breaking into editorial with a remote position at a lifestyle publication. Then, a few months later, I got a job at one of NYC's most prominent newspapers. It wasn't strictly focused on fashion, but it was my entry point.\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic meant I had to spend the first six months working from California, I was excited to move to New York as soon as possible.\n\nWithout knowing a single soul, I set off to the concrete jungle, armed with sheer ambition, nerves, and the belief that if I worked hard enough, I'd have that movie montage moment (cue \"Empire State of Mind\").\n\nI moved into an apartment on my own, and just like that, I was enveloped by the glittering scene that came with the gig, staring at my laptop until my eyes stung with tears and rubbing elbows with Hollywood's elite. It was a thrill, to say the least, but I still had my eyes on fashion.\n\nOne year later, I pulled it off, landing a role at the glossy I'd been collecting for nearly a decade.\n\nWithin days, my life changed: I was sitting front row at New York Fashion Week and juggling an output that seemed to multiply tenfold — making my heart race so fast my Oura ring began to flag stress spikes.\n\nThis new life shimmered from miles away, with friends and family saying, \"Your life is like a movie.\" By the world's standards, I had \"made it,\" but underneath the dazzling designer façade was a quiet truth no one had prepared me for.\n\nAttaining everything I'd dreamed of by 26 meant drowning in a sea of deadlines, navigating corporate politics, and feeling pressured to sustain my success — smack dab in the middle of a quarter-life crisis.\n\nThe increasing number of industry-wide layoffs also nixed the possibility of a promotion despite my best efforts. Still, the work accelerated and my responsibilities expanded. I was left feeling overlooked and depleted — and my mental health suffered.\n\nI began to question who I was apart from my career, if I wasn't climbing (and rising) to the top. What's worse is that this feeling began to seep into other areas of my life, feeding the lie that I didn't measure up.\n\nThat's when I realized \"making it\" couldn't be as simple as owning luxury handbags, interviewing stars, and typing up thousands of stories.\n\nInstead of feeling fulfilled, I was left with a strange ache that the life I'd worked so hard to achieve wasn't enough. So, I started re-evaluating how I wanted to live, my values, and where I saw myself in five years.\n\nI decided my next move would have to allow me to do what I love and still prioritize the other elements of my life that make me me: family, friendships, hobbies, and faith.\n\nStill, entertaining the concept of \"what comes next\" was unsettling, especially considering I'd up and moved my entire life just a few years prior, and I genuinely adored writing and style.\n\nI wondered whether pursuing something new would be a failure or if people would think I was weak. This inner debate gnawed at me for months, while work opportunities that once thrilled me felt like extra weight.\n\nBut finally, it clicked. Making a career change wouldn't be quitting or failing — I'd already clawed my way to the big leagues and thrived — and my purpose came from much more than my work.\n\nSo, nearly a year later, I left my dream job to freelance within the fashion space, deciding to stay within the industry and city I love — but on my own terms. Still, I'll always be grateful for the early years of my career; I couldn't have pursued my new path without them.\n\nAnd I know this won't be the final shift I make in my life, because it's the bends in the road that make it meaningful.\n\nAs it turns out, \"making it\" is a milestone that can be continually redefined, and landing my \"dream job\" was only the beginning of the story.",

    "fullText": "On a recent trip, my daughter and I were tossing her stuffed animal around the hotel room. The toy spun around near the ceiling and came to rest on the corner of the TV, high above our heads.\n\nMy daughter pointed and tried to explain where the animal landed, on the, the, the ... she didn't have the word for \"TV.\" Yep, we had to tell our 4-year-old what that big, black rectangle was called.\n\nIt's not because she's behind on vocab — we just don't have one in our home.\n\nFive years ago, when my family moved across the country, we decided to ditch our old TV to travel with fewer boxes. It wasn't worth the extra hassle to have another \"handle with care\" item in the truck.\n\nWe quickly realized that we liked our lifestyle without a television and decided not to replace it. Whenever I mention this to a friend, or someone comes over and sees a big painting where a TV usually is, they look at me like I have two heads.\n\nFor our family, though, this living-room setup feels completely natural.\n\nWhen our daughter was born, my husband and I set a goal to avoid screen time altogether for as long as possible. Not having a TV helps us achieve that.\n\nWe didn't introduce any movies or shows to her at home, and we're still going strong four years later. At first, it was harder for us as parents to get creative with new activities, but we enjoyed the challenge.\n\nInstead, we spend a lot of time reading books and playing games. My daughter and I visit the neighborhood library together at least once a week. I've started reading more as well, often opting for a bedtime book myself instead of staring at my iPad.\n\nWe spend lots of quality time together, too. Some nights, we'll run races in loops around the kitchen and living room or pretend a cardboard box is an airplane and zoom around. Now that she's older, we've started playing board games.\n\nI know we can't keep screens and tech out of our lives forever, but we hope we've given her a solid foundation of analog alternatives that she can turn to as she grows.\n\nMy husband and I love hiking, running, snowboarding, and more. We've kept up our outdoor activities and found ways to include our daughter.\n\nNo matter the weather, we're moving and playing outside. If it's raining, we do a puddle-jump walk. If it's warm and sunny, we slather on the SPF and dive into the pool or take a bike ride around the playground.\n\nA snowy day means taking the sled to the park for laps on the hill, snowball fights, and building a snowman or a fort.\n\nThere's no TV by the couch beckoning us to linger like we used to. Weekends spent watching Netflix or sports are a distant memory. I think we're all staying healthier as a result.\n\nThere are a few times I do miss having a big screen, like when our home team makes it to the playoffs or the Olympics roll around.\n\nWe usually get around this, though, by planning watch parties with friends — or setting up the iPad to catch special moments. When Faith Kipyegon was shooting for a record-breaking mile in under four minutes, I pulled up the stream and watched with my daughter on the kitchen floor.\n\nAll in all, though, we have no regrets and don't plan on purchasing a TV anytime soon. The benefits of living without one — and the sight of our daughter's artwork hung on the wall where a TV would usually be — matter more than any confused looks.\n\nI'm fine being the no-TV family, exploring the world instead of watching it on a screen.",

    "description": "Trump's White House photo harkens back to past portraits in which presidents appeared unsmiling against dark backgrounds.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's official White House portrait does not feature an American flag in the background — it's the first presidential photo in over 60 years without one.\n\nTaken by chief White House photographer Daniel Torok, the dramatically lit photo shows Trump against a dark backdrop with a serious expression. The style hearkens back to the past presidential portrait styles of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Calvin Coolidge, who also appeared unsmiling against dark backgrounds.\n\nAnd while there is no flag behind Trump in his new portrait, he is wearing an American flag pin on the lapel of his blue suit, a tradition that began with President George W. Bush's photo.\n\nA portrait of Trump released earlier last year, which did feature an American flag, was taken during the presidential transition period and \"was always meant to serve as a placeholder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nThe new photo is one of several aesthetic changes Trump has made to the White House in his second non-consecutive term. In the Entrance Hall, he moved President Barack Obama's painted White House portrait across the hall and replaced it with a painting depicting his raised fist following an assassination attempt. He has also added numerous gilded gold furnishings to the Oval Office and paved over the lawn in the Rose Garden to create a terrace he said would be better suited for large events.\n\nTake a look at how presidential portraits have changed through the years.",

    "fullText": "Last week, an AI-generated video of fake Tom Cruise duking it out with fake Brad Pitt on a rooftop freaked the internet out. Now, the Chinese tech giant behind the AI tool says it's going to take measures to improve copyright-related safeguards.\n\nIn a statement shared with Business Insider, ByteDance said it's going to \"strengthen safeguards\" on Seedance 2.0.\n\nOn Friday, Disney sent ByteDance a cease-and-desist letter, accusing the Chinese company of \"hijacking Disney's characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters.\"\n\nIn the statement to Business Insider, a ByteDance spokesperson said the company \"respects intellectual property rights\" and that it has \"heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.\"\n\n\"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,\" the spokesperson said in comments first reported by the BBC.\n\nThe company did not provide further details on the safeguards it's planning to introduce.\n\nByteDance, which is also the parent company behind TikTok, launched Seedance 2.0 in early February. Its ability to generate realistic, multi-shot video sequences has prompted pushback from Hollywood over concerns about AI's impact on entertainment jobs.\n\nCharles Rivkin, the chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association, accused Seedance 2.0 of engaging in \"unauthorized US copyrighted works on a massive scale.\"\n\n\"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs,\" Rivkin said in a statement last week.\n\nThe AI-generated video depicting Pitt and Cruise fighting on a rooftop quickly went viral last week, with many online commenting on how realistic the clip is.\n\nThe company also generated buzz with AI videos of Marvel's Wolverine fighting Thanos, and a lightsaber duel between Star Wars characters Anakin Skywalker and Rey. Both franchises are owned by Disney.\n\nWhile Disney has warned ByteDance to stop using its intellectual property, it signed a three-year licensing deal with OpenAI in December, giving users of its video-generation tool Sora access to 200 Disney characters.",

    "description": "After living in Denver for six years, I thought the city felt too crowded. Now that I moved, though, I love visiting for day trips and special events.",
    "fullText": "When I moved from Louisiana to Denver in my late 20s, I was drawn to the big — but not too big — city with easy access to the mountains.\n\nDespite enjoying Denver, however, I eventually realized it wasn't a place I wanted to live long-term. During the six years I lived there, the city was growing rapidly, adding over 115,000 residents — nearly a 20% increase — between 2010 and 2020.\n\nAs a result, logistics always felt complicated, from the traffic on the way to work each day to finding a parking space while visiting friends, and even getting a table at a restaurant. For many people, this probably wouldn't be an issue, but I found that my day-to-day quality of life wasn't as peaceful as I wanted it to be.\n\nSo, after several years in the city, I moved to Boulder, Colorado, where I've been enjoying the quieter pace of day-to-day life, and quicker access to the mountains.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of reasons I still love visiting Denver for a day trip or a staycation.\n\nI often spend a night or two in Denver for a quick change of pace to enjoy some of the city's unique hotels.\n\nThere are so many trendy options downtown (which is great if I'm heading to a concert or sporting event and don't want to drive home), and more upscale vibes in the Cherry Creek neighborhood, surrounded by shopping and art galleries.\n\nBeyond the major chains and larger hotels, there are plenty of boutique hotels, each with its own character. For me, Denver is the perfect place to take a break from the mountains and enjoy a night out.\n\nWhether it's baseball, basketball, hockey, or football, Denver's iconic teams make it easy to feel a part of the city's energy.\n\nAnd games here definitely aren't just for diehard fans — the stadiums themselves, the surrounding neighborhoods, and the pre-game rituals are all a fun experience regardless of your sports aptitude.\n\nEven if you're not catching a game in person, there are informal tailgating and fan-centered watch parties at many bars and restaurants in the area.\n\nOne of my favorite parts about Denver is the thriving arts scene, which can be seen in everything from the museums and concerts to the street fairs and festivals.\n\nDenver's museums have always been a highlight for me, and I enjoy taking in the architecture and collections at the Denver Art Museum, and learning about the state's past at the History Colorado Center.\n\nPlus, the city has an approachable and lively music scene. From intimate shows at Bluebird Theater or Larimer Lounge to big concerts at Ball Arena, there's always a chance to catch live music.\n\nEven without a concert, Denver has creative energy, with street art adorning nearly every corner, breweries hosting small live performances, and local coffee shops frequently featuring musicians.\n\nThere's always something going on, from art markets, to street fairs, and — my favorite — the Denver Chalk Art Festival.\n\nOne of the best things about visiting Denver is that it feels like a \"big city\" without being too overwhelming. It's easy to spend a Saturday hopping between neighborhoods, grabbing coffee, strolling through art districts, and finding peaceful spots or energetic rooftops with mountain views nearby.\n\nThere's a cool rhythm in Denver that seems to balance urban energy with approachable, more laid-back spaces and an outdoorsy vibe — even downtown.\n\nIt has enough to keep me busy for a weekend or longer, yet still feels manageable and welcoming — the perfect city to visit without the stress of living there.",

    "description": "Netflix docuseries \"Reality Check: Inside America's Next Top Model\" explores the  show's controversies, including that infamous race-swapping photoshoot.",
    "fullText": "In a new documentary, Tyra Banks responds to criticism of \"America's Next Top Model\" with a familiar refrain: \"Hindsight is 20/20.\" But for her former costar, Jay Manuel, one controversial moment was troubling from the start.\n\nNetflix's three-part documentary \"Reality Check: Inside America's Next Top Model\" explores the TV show's legacy, from its peak popularity in the early aughts to the divisive reactions from current viewers.\n\nPerhaps the most infamous photo shoot in \"Top Model\" history aired in 2005, when the season four contestants were told by Manuel, \"We're actually going to switch your ethnicities.\"\n\nSeveral of the models' faces and bodies were painted with dark makeup: Christina Murphy, Brittany Brower, and Noelle Staggers were assigned the roles of \"East Indian,\" \"African American,\" and \"traditionally African woman,\" respectively.\n\n\"The challenge here really is taking on the persona of that other ethnicity while in the photograph, and owning it,\" Manuel tells the models in the episode.\n\nMany viewers and critics have since condemned the photo shoot as blackface, an offensive practice that dates back to racist minstrel shows in the 1830s.\n\nIn the documentary, Manuel says he was uncomfortable with the concept from the start, especially given his family's history with racial segregation.\n\n\"The shoot that I had the most difficult time with was this race-swapping shoot. My parents are from South Africa. They grew up during apartheid. I am very aware of that history,\" he tells the camera. However, he says his objections were brushed off by Banks.\n\n\"I first asked to be excused from the photo shoot,\" Manuel continues. \"And Tyra said to me, 'I will handle this on camera with the girls at judging, just go and do your job.' I recognized that my role was starting to have limitations. That shoot was happening regardless.\"\n\nThe documentary includes clips from the episode, including several of Manuel, who was billed as the \"art director of photo shoots,\" coaching the models behind the camera.\n\n\"If you really look for it, you can see it on my face. Especially the setup for the day, where I tell the girls what we're doing. I could tell I was just, like, double swallowing,\" he recalls. \"But I just had to do my job.\"\n\nBanks, who created \"Top Model\" and hosted the reality show for 12 years, says she \"didn't think it was controversial\" at the time to paint the models' skin.\n\n\"I was in my own little bubble, in my own little head, that this was my way of showing the world that brown and Black is beautiful,\" she says in the documentary. \"But then we put it out there, and the world was like, 'Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?'\"\n\n\"Looking at the show now, through the 2020 lens, it's an issue, and I understand 100% why,\" Banks adds.\n\n\"Top Model\" became a surprise hit for UPN when it premiered in 2003. Banks worked with producer Ken Mok to develop a competition show that blended the performative elements of \"American Idol\" with the behind-the-scenes drama of \"The Real World.\"\n\nIt made for irresistible TV, and \"Top Model\" drew millions of viewers. However, Banks and Manuel both recall pressure to pump up the drama on \"Top Model\" as its audience continued to grow.\n\n\"It was a time in the world where there was a show, 'Fear Factor,' and 'Survivor,' and all of these things of, like, pushing the limits and all of that,\" Banks says. \"And so we kept pushing, and we kept creating more and more and more. You guys were demanding it.\"\n\nDawn Ostroff, then-president of UPN, says there was a constant push to raise the stakes, even as contestants were having emotional breakdowns or health emergencies on camera. Season three contestant Rebecca Epley fainted in the middle of judging, for example, and season seven winner CariDee English developed hypothermia during a photo shoot in a swimming pool.\n\n\"How do you get that, 'I can't believe they're doing that' moment again? You have to keep one-upping yourself,\" she says in the documentary. \"I never thought about, you know, 'Can we air it? Can't we air it?' Good television is good television.\"\n\nAlthough Manuel was originally cast as a creative director and occasional judge, he says the content of the challenges and photo shoots was largely out of his control, especially as the show got bigger. Eventually, his role was narrowed to \"on-camera talent.\"\n\n\"There was a time when the creative of the show started to shift. We were supposed to be showing the behind-the-scenes of what the fashion world was, helping change the industry. But the show had evolved in a way I'd never expected,\" Manuel says. \"I really struggled over some of the things that happened. And that was something that was slowly depleting me, chipping away at my soul.\"\n\nHe adds, \"Tyra would always reinforce, 'We need to keep it entertaining. We need to keep people watching.'\"\n\nIn \"Top Model\" season 13, which aired on The CW in 2009, the models were tasked with yet another race-swapping shoot. This time, Banks was the photographer.\n\nRepresentatives for Ostroff and Banks did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "NYC's City of Yes policy, led by Dan Garodnick, aims to address housing crisis. Mayor Mamdani faces challenges in implementing affordable solutions.",
    "fullText": "In his four years as director of the New York City Department of Planning, Dan Garodnick oversaw one of the most sweeping changes to the city's zoning rules in decades. The policy, called City of Yes, initiated a collection of revisions to boost housing, including updates that allow new apartment projects to add bulk used for affordable housing, homes to convert basements or add backyard cottages as accessory dwellings, and more office buildings to be converted into residential space.\n\nMayor Zohran Mamdani won the election last year on bold campaign pledges to deliver solutions for a worsening housing and affordability crisis. Mamdani's promises to freeze rents, however, could further dissuade owners of aging rent regulated apartment buildings — who were already dealt a financial blow by a 2019 change to the rent regulation rules — from performing needed maintenance.\n\nMamdani's mayoralty will be a test whether politicians across the country can lower housing costs without destabilizing the landlords that build and maintain most of the housing stock.\n\nGarodnick, who will soon leave his post, spoke with Business Insider to look back on his accomplishments and offer advice to the new mayor. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe real estate community has not been excited about Mamdani. What would you tell them?\n\nI would encourage them to give him a chance to lay out his agenda for housing and economic development and make their determinations.\n\nWhat advice did you give him? Did you give him any?\n\nFocus on delivering results and making sure that the government can execute ideas at scale. And also that the city council is meant to be an active counterbalance to the mayor, and that is something he should embrace and to give elected officials the tools they need to be able to say yes to hard things.\n\nDo you think Mamdani will freeze regulated rents? Do you think that's the right move?\n\nYes. I think that's a top priority for the mayor, and I think people should expect to see that.\n\nI think it's an important signal to renters that the mayor is looking out for them and their interests. I also think it's important to strike a balance here and make sure that it does not have unintended consequences and push buildings into distress.\n\nLandlords of regulated buildings are saying their properties are falling apart, and they have no incentive to fix them. Do they need money from rent increases?\n\nIt's important that the city and state make sure that its policies not only protect tenants from unreasonable rent increases and abuse from landlords, but also that the living conditions and the health and safety of these buildings is satisfactory too. We need to make sure that we're striking the right balance here.\n\nAfter four years at the agency, how does it feel to leave?\n\nWe enabled through zoning changes in four years, more homes than had been enabled in the prior 20 years combined.\n\nYou have rules that were written 60 years ago that had the effect of limiting too narrowly where and how much housing you can build. It is no surprise then that you would see many neighborhoods of the city producing little or no house. City of Yes was designed to enable a little more housing in every neighborhood of the city.\n\nThe real estate community says that may be impressive, but it's still not enough to get housing built at scale.\n\nThere is no question that while zoning sticks around for long periods of time, there are other factors like the interest rate environments, the existence of a tax incentive, or even any single property owner's appetite for risk or access to capital.\n\nThere is often substantial pushback against ambitious rezonings. What does that say about the public's reception to housing development at scale?\n\nChange is hard, and people are rightfully skeptical. We focused relentlessly on clarity, plain language explanations, visual tools, multilingual outreach, and engagement with communities across the city. We met people where they were, and we explained how outdated rules affect everyday life and made the case that the housing crisis isn't inevitable.\n\nWhat is the political feasibility in your mind of dramatic solutions to the housing crisis, specifically large-scale development?\n\nWe wanted to strike a balance here that was historic in its scale, but also something that we believed we could build support for. That is always going to be a balance. I will note that the voters of New York City recently approved charter revisions, which will make it easier in some cases to allow for housing to be approved more quickly and shows that there's an appetite for the city, the mayor, the city council, to continue to take some big swings at this problem.\n\nWhat do you think those big swings will be?\n\nMayor Mamdani has been clear about his interest in creating more housing in New York City and has cited City of Yes as an important template to build on. As he's shaping his agenda, I would expect you might see some exciting new initiatives that continue to move the ball forward.",

The Quantum Circuit Inc. acquisition adds gate-model quantum technology to its established quantum-annealing platform, which could broaden the types of problems D-Wave can tackle, especially for AI and machine-learning workloads. The $10 million, two-year Quantum Computing as a Service agreement with a Fortune 100 customer and the $20 million system installation at Florida Atlantic University give the company multi-year, contract-backed visibility rather than just one-off pilot projects. For you as an investor, the key question is whether these deals become templates that can be reused with other large enterprises and institutions, or remain isolated wins. Competition from players like IonQ, Rigetti, and large tech groups such as IBM or Alphabet means execution quality, speed of product integration after the Quantum Circuit deal, and customer satisfaction on these deployments could be important differentiators.",

    "fullText": "Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown had a brand event he was hosting shut down on Saturday night by Beverly Hills police over what they said was a permit issue.\n\nBut on Sunday, following the All-Star Game at the Intuit Dome in Southern California, Brown completely disputed a statement that Beverly Hills police released about the incident.\n\n\"I'm offended by Beverly Hills by the statement they put out, like we applied for something and didn't get it, and we did it anyway [and] we were insubordinate,\" Brown said, via ESPN. \"I know how to follow the rules. I'm smart enough to follow the guidelines. It just seemed like somebody didn't want whatever we had going on to go on because out of everybody that was doing something, it seemed like I was the only one that gets shut down.\"\n\nBrown had planned several events at a mansion in the Trousdale Estates neighborhood of Beverly Hills on Saturday, according to The Boston Globe, including a networking event and a panel discussion. But on Saturday night, police walked on stage at the panel to shut it down. At least seven police cars were parked outside to try and get the crowd of about 200 people to disperse.\n\nOn Sunday, before the All-Star Game, the City of Beverly Hills released a statement saying that an “event permit had been applied for and denied” due to previous violations at the event address. Further specifics aren't known.\n\n“Despite the fact that the permit was denied, organizers still chose to proceed with inviting hundreds of guests knowing that it was not allowed to occur. BHPD responded and shut down the unpermitted event,” the city said, in part.\n\nBrown said on Sunday that the event was being hosted at Oakley founder Jim Jannard’s house. Brown has a sponsorship with Oakley, and said the city’s statement about a permit “was not true.”\n\n\"We didn't need a permit because the owner of the house, that was his space. We were family friends,” Brown said. “He opened up the festivities to us so we didn't have to. We never applied for one. ... I didn't have to pay for the house or anything. They just opened it up. I had to pay for the build out, but it was hundreds of thousands of dollars wasted for an event that was supposed to be positive.\"\n\nBrown posted a video of his interaction with a Beverley Hills police officer on social media on Saturday, and said he felt like “we’re being targeted.”\n\n300k down the drain @BeverlyHillsPD\n\n— Jaylen Brown (@FCHWPO) February 16, 2026\n\nBeverly Hills is so trash I’m offended had a great panel about the future of culture with great guest people worked hard for this how dare yall\n\n— Jaylen Brown (@FCHWPO) February 15, 2026\n\nBrown was asked directly whether he felt the move was racially motivated on Sunday night.\n\n“All I'm going to say is that everybody else that did something in activation, [there] seemed to be no issues,\" Brown said. \"It was 7 p.m. It wasn't 10 p.m., it wasn't 11 p.m., it wasn't [midnight].

The incident, Brown said, meant “hundreds of thousands of dollars lost down the toilet.”\n\n\"The owner seemed like he was pretty upset,\" Brown said. \"He wants to file a lawsuit because it's his house. They've done multiple events there and there's never been an issue. He's done four or five events even that week, he said, and it was never an issue.\"",

    "description": "Figure skaters can spin more than two dozen times during a routine, and yet they don't get dizzy. If you've ever wondered why, here's the answer.",
    "fullText": "MILAN — When Amber Glenn takes the ice this week for her short program, she’s expected to skate a graceful routine that will end with a series of spins. If she performs as expected, the spins — more than two dozen in all — will be a dramatic crescendo, the culmination of a meticulously prepared routine.\n\nAnd many of the millions watching at home will wonder, How does she do that? Very quickly followed by, Hey, why isn’t she just throwing up on the ice right now from dizziness?\n\nThe answer to both questions — the ability to spin, and the ability to stave off dizziness — is the same: practice. Lots and lots of practice.\n\nLet’s start with a basic but neurologically complex question: What exactly is dizziness? You know it when you feel it, but what exactly is it?\n\n“There are many causes of dizziness, but neurologically speaking, which I think is most relevant here, dizziness is caused by dysfunction of the vestibular system,” Dr. Lindsay J. Agostinelli, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, told Yahoo Sports in an email. “The vestibular system is an apparatus in our inner ears that detects head motion and rotation, sending signals to our brain to then turn our eyes in order to maintain balance and prevent dizziness as we move through space.”\n\nSkaters, like dancers, begin to prepare for spinning by focusing on a single spot in the distance as they spin, then turning their head quickly and relocating that point, Dr. Agostinelli notes. That allows them to quickly stabilize themselves and stave off dizziness.\n\nBut that method won’t exactly work on ice, when skaters are whipping around five or six times a second. The only way to solve that problem, Dr. Agostinelli suggests, is by repetition, breaking down your traditional dizzy reaction to spinning.\n\n“Research studies have shown that figure skaters actually have a less reactive vestibular system, and when exposed to a ‘nauseogenic simulation’ that rotated/ spun them, they felt less motion sick compared to non-skaters,” Dr. Agostinelli says. “This is likely a result of their training which habituates their vestibular systems.”\n\nFighting off dizziness is a mental battle that becomes a physical one. “I think initial training requires mental toughness to fight through the requisite dizziness,” Dr. Agostinelli says, “but the ability to perform at high speeds without dizziness is clearly a result of the physical training and desensitization process.”\n\nSo there you go. If you want to stay as level-headed as a skater, start spinning now. Carefully.",

    "title": "Inside the career rise of Sundar Pichai, Google and Alphabet's current CEO",
    "description": "Meet Sundar Pichai, the man leading Google and Alphabet as CEO, who is leading the search giant through the AI race.",
    "fullText": "Sundar Pichai has had a meteoric rise since joining Google as a 31-year-old product manager in 2004.\n\nIn the 11 years that followed his first steps on the Googleplex, Pichai was promoted four times, eventually becoming the CEO of Google in 2015.\n\nIn that role, he was responsible for the company's core businesses and cash cow — and did a good enough job that, in December 2019, he was promoted one more time, replacing Google cofounder Larry Page as the CEO of Alphabet, Google's parent company.\n\nSince then, he has led the almost-$2-trillion company through the pandemic, layoffs, and the AI renaissance that's taken Silicon Valley by storm.\n\nSo, who is Pichai, and how did he scale the ranks to get one of the most important jobs at one of the most important companies in the world? Here's a look at his life and career.\n\nPichai, whose full name is actually Pichai Sundararajan, grew up in Chennai, India.\n\nPichai's father was an electrical engineer, and his mother worked as a stenographer before having him and his younger brother. The family wasn't wealthy, and the boys slept together in the living room of their two-room apartment.\n\nEarly on, Pichai's family realized he had a talent for remembering numbers after noticing he could recall every phone number he had ever dialed on their rotary phone. He has been known to sometimes show off his memorization skills at meetings, Bloomberg said in 2014.\n\nAfter becoming interested in computers — the first software program he wrote was a chess game — Pichai studied engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur. His success there won him a scholarship to Stanford University.\n\nPichai earned a master's degree from Stanford and later attended the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School for his MBA.\n\nPichai has said that moving to California was a huge leap.\n\n\"I always loved technology growing up,\" Pichai said in a 2014 interview at Delhi University. \"I used to read about what was happening in Silicon Valley, and I wanted to be a part of it.\"\n\nWhen Pichai got to America in 1993, he couldn't believe how expensive everything was.\n\nHe \"was in an absolute state of shock\" about the price of a backpack — $60 — he told Bloomberg.\n\nHe also missed his girlfriend, Anjali. The two eventually married and now have a son, Kiran, and daughter, Kavya.\n\nBefore Google, he had stints at semiconductor manufacturer Applied Materials and consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nPichai had his first interview at Google on April Fools' Day in 2004 — the same day it launched Gmail. Pichai has said he initially thought the free email service was one of Google's famous pranks.\n\nPichai got his start working as a VP of product management, focused on Google's Toolbar, a web-search feature on Internet Explorer and Firefox.\n\nOne of his early achievements: convincing Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin that Google should build its own web browser.\n\nIn 2006, Microsoft created a \"doomsday\" scenario for Google by making Bing the new default search engine on Internet Explorer. To mitigate the effect of this change, Pichai helped convince Google execs to create its own browser, Google Chrome.\n\nChrome is now the world's most popular browser.\n\nAs a leader at Google, Pichai was known to be well-liked and focused on results, which resulted in more responsibility.\n\nPichai's \"substance over overt style\" approach was, in part, what led to Pichai taking over the Android division in 2013.\n\nHe spearheaded Android One, Google's push to \"make high-quality smartphones accessible to as many people as possible,\" and was also instrumental in ensuring Android was better integrated with Google.\n\nPichai was also behind Chrome OS, the operating system that powers Google's inexpensive Chromebook laptops, and was reportedly instrumental in helping put together Google's $3.2 billion acquisition of Nest in 2014.\n\nHis success garnered attention, and he was reportedly approached for a leadership role at Twitter.\n\nWhen Pichai turned down Twitter, he was rewarded for his allegiance, getting $50 million and a promotion.\n\nAs he rose through the ranks, Pichai became the right-hand man of Google cofounder and former CEO Larry Page.\n\n\"He's like the Aaron to Larry's Moses,\" a source told Business Insider in 2014, referring to the biblical prophet's brother.\n\nThat relationship and his success led to Pichai's next important promotion in late 2014 when Page put him in charge of the company's core products.\n\nAfter proving himself with Chrome and Android, Pichai added Google+, Maps, Search, commerce and ads, and infrastructure to his portfolio. The move cemented Pichai's move as Page's second-in-command.\n\n\"Sundar has a tremendous ability to see what's ahead and mobilize teams around the super important stuff,\" Page wrote in a memo announcing Pichai's promotion. \"We very much see eye-to-eye when it comes to product, which makes him the perfect fit for this role.\"\n\nWhen Alphabet was established as Google's parent company in 2015, Pichai was made CEO at Google, which encompassed search, YouTube, and Android.\n\nIn July 2017, Pichai was named to Alphabet's board of directors.\n\n\"Sundar has been doing a great job as Google's CEO, driving strong growth, partnerships, and tremendous product innovation. I really enjoy working with him, and I'm excited that he is joining the Alphabet board,\" Page said at the time.\n\nTwo years later came his final promotion at the company. Alphabet's CEO, Page, and president, Sergey Brin, announced that they were stepping down, and Pichai would become Alphabet's CEO.\n\nPage and Brin cofounded Google in 1998. They announced the change in a letter saying that Alphabet and Google \"no longer need two CEOs and a President.\"\n\nPichai earned a total of $226 million in 2022, with his pay spiking thanks to a multi-year stock award granted that year, making him one of America's best-paid CEOs.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, Pichai earned $10.73 million in total compensation.\n\nPichai became a billionaire in 2025, according to the the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe top job at Alphabet also comes with increased public and internal scrutiny.\n\nIn 2018, the House Judiciary Committee grilled the CEO about Google's data privacy practices and plans with China.\n\nTwo years later, Pichai testified in front of Congress again over antitrust concerns. Two other major Google lawsuits were later filed by the US government over its alleged monopoly tactics.\n\nIn August 2024, a federal judge ruled against Google, finding the company had violated antitrust law to keep a monopoly on search.\n\nWhen penalties were announced in September 2025, Google was not forced to sell off its Chrome browser despite the Justice Department's request for that remedy. The judge ruled Google could no longer have exclusive search deals, and the company's stock jumped following the announcement.\n\nGoogle also dealt with internal turmoil after letting go of one of its top AI ethicists.\n\nIn December 2020, Google fired Timnit Gebru. Her exit came weeks after she was asked to retract a paper on the dangers of large language models and spoke out against the company's treatment of minority employees.\n\nGoogle employees were \"seriously pissed\" over how the firing was handled, one told BI at the time, and Gebru said that Pichai and other managers helped create \"hostile work environments.\"\n\nPichai eventually apologized for how the company dealt with it.\n\n\"I want to say how sorry I am for that, and I accept the responsibility of working to restore your trust,\" he wrote.\n\nAlso in 2020, Pichai was at the forefront of Google's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under his leadership, Google launched initiatives to help search users find accurate, useful information about the coronavirus.\n\nAnd like many large tech companies, Alphabet recruited rapidly at the start of the pandemic. Alphabet hired nearly 37,000 new workers in the 12 months leading up to October 2022.\n\nBut from late 2022, Pichai had to oversee an era of cost-cutting at the company.\n\nThat culminated in job losses in January 2023, when Google layoffs affected 12,000 employees or 6% of its global workforce. Pichai said he took \"full responsibility for the decisions that led us here.\"\n\nOver 1,400 Google employees wrote an open letter to Pichai about how the layoffs were handled.\n\n\"Don't be evil,\" it read, a reference to the company's original motto.\n\nGooglers also criticized Pichai's big payday in the face of the job cuts, accusing him of \"destroying morale and culture\" at Google.\n\nGoogle also laid off hundreds more workers in its central engineering division and hardware team in early 2024.\n\nJob cuts continued into 2025, with the company flattening its management layer and shedding roles in its Cloud unit. In February 2026, Business Insider reported Google was offering buyouts to staff in its business unit who aren't \"all in.\"\n\nPichai has also had to deal with European regulatory issues. French regulators hit Google with a roughly $270 million fine in March 2024, accusing the company of using news outlet articles to train its Gemini AI model.\n\nPichai has also pushed Google forward in the AI arms race that's preoccupying Silicon Valley.\n\nGoogle issued a \"code red\" in December 2022 after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT sparked concerns about the future of its search engine and whether chatbots might replace it. Pichai redirected resources to focus on building Google's AI products.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Pichai expressed interest in the technology, though. In 2016, Pichai announced that Google would be an \"AI-first\" company. Two years later, he said it's \"one of the most important things that humanity is working on\" and \"more profound\" than \"electricity or fire.\"\n\nGoogle's AI efforts have resulted in its own chatbot.\n\nIn December 2023, Google's Gemini launched. Gemini is a multimodal AI model that can process images, text, audio, video, and coding languages.\n\nPichai has also shifted Google's focus to integrating AI into its other products.\n\nAt the 2023 Google I/O conference, the CEO announced that Google would add AI features across Google Workspace, including in Search, Gmail, Docs, and other products.\n\nGoogle's traditional search function has also become an AI product, with AI overviews rolling out in 2024.\n\nAlphabet has continued to invest heavily in AI.\n\nOn an earnings call in February 2026, Google announced it planned to double its capital expenditure in 2026, with its spending expected to reach between $175 billion and $185 billion. Much of that was expected to go towards building out AI infrastructure, like chips and data centers.\n\nThe company also announced the Gemini app had over 750 million monthly active users, up 100 million from October.\n\nWhile Pichai is quite private, he is known to start his day with a cup of tea and an omelet — plus a copy of The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"I read the physical paper every single morning,\" he told Recode in 2016, adding that he reads The New York Times online.\n\nThe Pichai's morning routine also includes scrolling through TechMeme, a niche tech news website that aggregates the latest stories in tech published by media outlets.\n\nAlthough he's private, Pichai has spoken out about certain causes since he became a public figure.\n\nIn 2015, he responded to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's suggestion that Muslims be barred from immigrating to the US.\n\n\"Let's not let fear defeat our values. We must support Muslim and other minority communities in the US and around the world,\" he wrote.\n\nPichai was among the Big Tech executives who attended Trump's inauguration in 2025. Google also donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nPichai is seen as something of a hero in his home country of India.\n\n\"You are what they would like to be, an Indian who studied here, went overseas, and did what everyone would dream of doing,\" interviewer Harsha Bhogle said in a conversation with Pichai for students at Delhi University.\n\nIn 2020, Pichai announced that Google would invest $10 billion into India's tech sector over the next five to seven years to make the internet \"affordable and useful\" to everyone living in the country.\n\nJillian D'Onfro, Avery Hartmans, and Mary Meisenzahl contributed to an earlier version of this article.",

    "description": "Gallup announced the end of its presidential approval polls after nearly 90 years. Here's how previous presidents ranked.",
    "fullText": "For nearly 90 years, the Gallup presidential approval polls have measured Americans' public opinion on the president's job performance, but soon, they'll be a thing of the past.\n\nLast week, Gallup, the analytics and polling company that pioneered presidential approval ratings, confirmed the end of its presidential approval polls that, since the 1930s, have asked Americans: \"Do you approve or disapprove of the way [the current president] is handling his job as president?\"\n\nThe company cited a \"shift in corporate strategy\" as the driving force behind the decision, The New York Times reported. Instead, Gallup will \"focus more on issues and policy polling.\"\n\nIn Gallup's latest poll, conducted in early December 2025, 36% of respondents said they approved of Trump's performance, down from 47% in early 2025 after he took office for the second time.\n\nIn the poll, 59% of respondents said they disapproved of his handling of the presidency, slightly down from 60% in late November 2025.\n\nDuring his second term, Trump is seeking to rewrite US immigration policies while making sweeping changes to the federal workforce and the White House itself. But in his first term, he made history in a different way: He was the first president since Gallup began tracking presidential approval in the 1930s never to surpass a 50% job approval rating.\n\nThe American Presidency Project from the University of California, Santa Barbara, compiled the final Gallup ratings of each president's term from the past 70 years, signaling how popular each leader was when they left the Oval Office.\n\nSee how US presidents from Harry Truman to Joe Biden rank in this end-of-term polling. We've ordered them from the lowest to the highest approval rating.\n\nEven though Nixon won the 1972 election in a historic landslide, the end of his presidency was tainted by the Watergate scandal that led him to resign on August 9, 1974, when faced with the threat of an impeachment and removal.\n\nSurveyed August 2 to 5, 1974, after the House Judiciary Committee passed articles of impeachment against the president but before he resigned, 66% of respondents to the Gallup poll said they disapproved of Nixon's presidency, the highest of any president on the list.\n\nAssuming the presidency after Franklin D. Roosevelt's death, Truman served two terms covering the aftermath of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, including the Korean War, which was widely unpopular and contributed to Truman's low approval rating by the end of his second term in 1953.\n\nWhen asked December 11 to 16, 1952, 56% of poll respondents said they disapproved of his handling of the presidency.\n\nCarter had high approval ratings — and a disapproval rating in the single digits — during the early days of his term, but his handling of international affairs, such as the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, along with a struggling economy, ultimately made him unpopular by the end of his term.\n\nHe lost the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan and faced a disapproval rating of 55% in polling conducted December 5 to 8, when he was readying to leave the White House.\n\nDespite uniting the nation in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, Bush saw his public approval fade during his second term. His approval rating spiked after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, and the capture of Saddam Hussein.\n\nAfter his reelection, his popularity began to decline as the Iraq War extended. His handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the onset of the 2008 financial crisis also contributed to his growing unpopularity.\n\nFrom January 9 to 11, 2009, as Bush prepared to hand over the presidency to Barack Obama, 61% of poll respondents said they disapproved of his handling of the presidency.\n\nTrump's first presidency was divisive from the start, as he entered the White House with an approval rating below 50%. He's the first president in modern history to never exceed 50% approval on the Gallup polls during his presidency.\n\nWhile his approval ratings dwindled over the course of his four years in office, his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular came under scrutiny ahead of his loss in the 2020 election. His lowest approval ratings in office came during the final Gallup poll, conducted January 4 to 15, 2021.\n\nMost of that polling period took place immediately after the Capitol insurrection on January 6, and Trump faced a disapproval rating of 62%, the worst after Richard Nixon's at the time he left the office.\n\nWhile Biden saw continuous approval ratings over 50% during his first six months in office, rises in inflation and illegal immigration, as well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, contributed to lowering approval ratings.\n\nHis lowest-ranking Gallup poll, in which 36% of respondents said they approved of his handling of the role, came in July 2024, a month after his debate performance against Trump shifted focus toward his age and fitness for office.\n\nAs he left office, in polls collected January 2 to 16, 2025, Biden received a disapproval rating of 54%.\n\nAfter assuming the presidency because of John F. Kennedy's assassination, Johnson won the 1964 election in a historic landslide, but he faced decreasing approval ratings over his handling of the Vietnam War.\n\nLow approval ratings, along with a divided party, led Johnson to withdraw from the presidential race in 1968. At the time of his withdrawal, 36% of poll respondents said they approved of his handling of the presidency.\n\nAssuming the presidency at the time of Nixon's resignation, Ford served as US president from August 1974 until January 1977, after he lost the election to Jimmy Carter.\n\nDuring his presidency, Ford faced mixed reviews, with his approval dropping after he pardoned Nixon and introduced conditional amnesty for draft dodgers in September 1974.\n\nPolled December 10 to 13, 1976, after he had lost the reelection to Jimmy Carter, 32% of respondents said they disapproved of Ford's handling of the presidency, and 15% said they had no opinion on it, the highest percentage of the listed presidents.\n\nThough the elder Bush lost his reelection bid in the 1992 presidential election against Bill Clinton, the public opinion of him was positive by the end of his term.\n\nIn the weeks before his nomination as the Republican candidate for the presidency in 1992, however, he had only a 29% approval rating, the lowest of his presidency. A recession and a reversal of his tax policy contributed to his drop in popularity.\n\nIn polling conducted January 8 to 11, 1993, 37% of respondents said they disapproved of his handling of the presidency, while 56% said they approved.\n\nSince the beginning of his presidency in 2009, Obama had a high approval rating for a modern-day president; he averaged nearly 47% approval over eight years.\n\nAt his lowest point, in polling conducted September 8 to 11, 2011, 37% of poll respondents said they approved of his presidency, the decline most likely influenced by the president's healthcare policies and his handling of the 2008 economic crisis and the following rise in unemployment rates.\n\nIn polls conducted January 17 to 19, 2017, when Obama was leaving office, 37% of respondents said they disapproved of his handling of the role, with 59% saying they approved.\n\nAfter winning the 1952 election in a landslide, Eisenhower saw high approval ratings throughout his presidency, never dropping below the disapproval rating.\n\nHolding office during critical Cold War years, Eisenhower saw his stay positive throughout the end of his second term, with only 28% of respondents polled December 8 to 13, 1960, saying they disapproved of his handling of the presidency, the lowest of the presidents listed.\n\nReagan's strong leadership toward ending the Cold War and implementing his economic policies contributed to consistently positive ratings during his presidency and the subsequent election of his vice president, George H. W. Bush, as his successor to the presidency.\n\nAfter winning the 1992 elections against the incumbent George H. W. Bush, Clinton saw high approval ratings throughout his presidency, though he faced mixed opinions at times during his first term because of his domestic agenda, including tax policy and social issues.\n\nDespite being impeached in 1998 by the House of Representatives over his testimony describing the nature of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Clinton continued to see positive approval ratings during his second term.\n\nNear the time he left the White House, he had an approval rating of 66%, the highest of all the presidents on this list. In the poll conducted January 10 to 14, 2001, 29% of respondents said they disapproved of his handling of the presidency.",

    "fullText": "When I moved to San Francisco almost 13 years ago, I never imagined how much it would help my career — and, unexpectedly, lead me to fall in love with the country outside of it.\n\nI have always lived in cities, from Viña del Mar, Chile, where I was born, to Los Angeles, where I grew up. However, my marketing career didn't really take off until I moved to San Francisco, the epicenter of the startup boom.\n\nThere, I had everything I wanted: I was surrounded by potential clients, I dined at fancy restaurants, I made great friends, and I had no shortage of access to top music venues, cafés, bars, and wine-country weekends.\n\nI fell in love with San Francisco, which was like a huge playground for adults with no kids. It's also where I met and married the love of my life.\n\nBut in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the US, I had my first child and San Francisco (like many other big cities) seemed to empty out. That's when my husband and I decided we'd like to move closer to my parents in Los Angeles and buy a house with acreage.\n\nIt felt right after living in a small apartment in the city for so long — we wanted distance from other people, and the freedom to grow our own food, and live a calmer life.\n\nWe set our sights on a place in the Southern California countryside when we realized how much further our money could go there.\n\nOur new home is only about an hour from major cities, like Los Angeles and San Diego, but it's still the most remote place I've lived.\n\nThe city is also quite small, with a population of about 100,000 people — a stark contrast to the 800,000 in San Francisco and millions in Los Angeles.\n\nI didn't know what to expect when we moved, but I've found myself pleasantly surprised.\n\nLife seems to move slower and there's far less noise and light pollution. At night, our sky lights up with stars. Instead of traffic being spread all over, like in other cities we've lied in, it's mostly just confined to a few busy streets.\n\nOn top of getting much more house and yard than we could afford in a bigger city, we've found a lot of our everyday expenses, like groceries and gas, are about 20% cheaper here.\n\nOur city's small-town feel is refreshing and it's also been easy to build community. Strangers smile at us often, and locals have been welcoming and genuinely friendly. We've even become friends with all of our neighbors.\n\nI still get culture shock when I bump into acquaintances at the farmers market, or when the store clerk talks to us like we're old pals.\n\nThe biggest gossip topics around here are which fancy new apartment buildings might be built and the newest batch of coyotes.\n\nMy daughter also loves her school, which feels like a tight-knit community of families — many of whom also moved away from big cities.\n\nSure there's drawbacks. At times, living in a more remote area can also feel isolating.\n\nWe're far from friends, fun malls, and trendy gyms. Sometimes I miss going to fancy farmers markets and trying a new restaurant every week.\n\nGoing into a nearby bigger city takes planning and effort — especially if you have kids — and at least an hourlong drive.\n\nWe also have more limited shopping and grocery-store options, and scheduling doctor visits can be tricky when everyone goes to the same four clinics.\n\nHowever, what we've lost in big-city perks, we have gained back in nature with easy access to horses, hiking trails, farms, and petting zoos. We may be far from a Whole Foods, but we're close to neighbors who sell homemade bread, organic cheese, jam and goat milk.\n\nOur area is less diverse than the cities we left behind, but I've still found community here among people who share my values and interests.\n\nAnd all that we have here — space, time, fresh air, calm, community — has completely changed how I live and what I now prioritize. This move has felt like a reset to to my nervous system.\n\nI never imagined I would live in the country and love it — city friends are still skeptical when they come visit.\n\nHowever, seeing what's possible when you venture out of your comfort zone has even inspired some of them to move to more remote areas, too.\n\nStill, I'd never change the path that brought me here. San Francisco and Los Angeles are great cities with incredible energy — especially if you're early in your career — but at this stage of my life, the things that make me happy are in this cozy countryside.\n\nThe area feels very well-suited for aging. It's a place where slowing down isn't seen as \"failing\"; and being close to San Diego, with its world-class medical institutions, has made it easy to imagine staying here for the rest of our lives.",

    "description": "Zillow anticipates improved affordability across the board for homebuyers, but especially in these 20 metros.",
    "fullText": "Relief for homebuyers is on the horizon in 2026.\n\nZillow analyzed 50 of the largest US metros and found that 20 of them will become affordable by the end of 2026. The company defined \"affordable\" as mortgage payments not exceeding 30% of the median household income.\n\nAlthough affordability is improving across the US, Zillow senior economist Kara Ng told Business Insider that buyers may not feel it in already expensive markets, like Seattle, for example.\n\n\"The typical household buying a typical home in Seattle is going to spend 47% of their income on monthly payments,\" Ng told Business Insider. \"We expect them to spend from 47% down to 45% over the next year. So that's an improvement in affordability, but it's a very different starting place.\"\n\nThe Midwest has reclaimed its spot as the most affordable region of the country, taking up nearly half of the list, while the Sun Belt, once established as the hottest place to be, sees a slight exodus.\n\n\"The Midwest markets generally avoided the steepest pandemic-era price run ups — so if they were affordable, they're probably still affordable now,\" Ng said. \"For the Sun Belt, what happened was that everyone wanted to go to the Sun Belt. They wanted outdoor living, they wanted sun, they wanted relatively affordable prices, so prices really shot up.\"\n\nWhile pretty much every market will experience some improvement in affordability, that doesn't necessarily mean home prices are going down. Prices are essentially staying put nationwide, Ng said, but with mortgage rates decreasing and incomes steadily increasing, buyers in 2026 will have $30,000 in additional buying power versus 2025.\n\nHere are 20 metros that Zillow expects to reach the affordable threshold in 2026.\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $374,477\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 30.6%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 29.9%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $336,642\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 30.4%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 29.7%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $429,840\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 30.4%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 29.6%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $319,035\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 30%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 29.5%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $312,751\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 29.4%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 28.9%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $303,084\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 29.8%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 28.8%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $377,251\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 30%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 28.7%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $391,913\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 29.3%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 28.2%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $297,209\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 28.6%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 28.1%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $238,517\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 28.1%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 27.7%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $274,336\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 28.9%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 27.7%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $239,011\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 27.7%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 26.9%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $284,684\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 27%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 26.6%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $270,246\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 27.2%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 26.4%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $272,868\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 26.6%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 26.3%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $239,880\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 26.9%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 26.3%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $256,357\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 26.1%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 25.5%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $263,846\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 25.9%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 25.2%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $251,913\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 24.2%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 23.3%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $218,845\n\nShare of median household income spent on mortgage: 22.3%\n\nExpected affordability by end of 2026: 21.4%",

    "description": "The actions you can take to prevent secondhand smoke depend on where you live.",
    "fullText": "Recreational cannabis has been legalized in Washington state for more than 10 years — but there are still restrictions on where you can use it.\n\nMost of the time, regulations deal with the act of consuming cannabis. What if you have a complaint about the trail of smoke that follows?\n\nCan you call the police on your neighbor for blowing pot smoke into your backyard?\n\nIn Washington state, you’re allowed to purchase, possess and use cannabis products on private property, as long as you’re 21 or older.\n\n“You can consume (cannabis) openly in a residence as long as the property owner allows it,” according to a brochure produced by the Washington State Liquor Control Board and its partners.\n\nLandlords can impose rules for smoking inside and outside, and property owners are allowed to ban cannabis usage on their land or building, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nPublic consumption of cannabis is prohibited in Washington state, according to the Revised Code of Washington.\n\nThat means you can’t smoke weed while standing on the sidewalk, walking down the street, hiking a public trail or hanging out in a park.\n\nYou’re also not allowed to vape marijuana or eat edibles “in view of the general public or in a public place,” state law says.\n\nIf your neighbor blows cannabis smoke onto your property, can you get them to stop?\n\nThe biggest factor will be what kind of property you’re both on.\n\nIf you catch a neighbor smoking marijuana on a rental property, you can get the landlord involved.\n\nIf you and your neighbor are both on individually owned properties, you may have difficulty restricting their cannabis usage.\n\nMost apartment complexes in Washington state prohibit smoking in common areas under state law. You can report violations to your local public health department.\n\nRegardless of the property where you’re living, consider trying to reach an amicable resolution with your neighbor before getting law enforcement or property officials involved.\n\nReach out to your neighbor and explain that smoke is being blown toward your home, and why you have an issue with it. Clark County Public Health has a renters toolkit for handling such scenarios.\n\nYou can ask your neighbor for a compromise, and see if they’re willing to consume cannabis in a different spot at their home to avoid blowing smoke onto your property.\n\nSuggest you’re open to discussing further to come to an agreement together.\n\nIf this doesn’t work, try mediation options. If you’re both in a shared community, such as an apartment complex, duplex or homeowners association, you can ask a board member or landlord to help mediate.\n\nYou can also contact your local dispute resolution center for professional mediation assistance at a low cost.\n\nIf you’re living in an area designated as non-smoking, but your landlord doesn’t enforce the policy, the Tenants Union of Washington State has resources.\n\nIf you’re living in an area that isn’t designated as non-smoking, you can inform your landlord you feel affected by secondhand smoke and request to be moved to a smoke-free area — or ask them to implement a no-smoking policy.\n\nClark County Public Health has a renters toolkit for handling such scenarios.\n\nIf the conflict continues, you may be able to take legal action. This should be a last resort, as the negative impacts of the smoke will likely be hard to prove.\n\nIf you can prove the smoke has damaged your property or is endangering the “comfort, repose, health or safety of others,” you can claim it’s a “private nuisance.”\n\nAt that point, you may consider getting lawyers involved.\n\nIf you live in an apartment or other shared space you don’t own, your landlord is allowed to enforce a no-smoking policy if it’s in your rental agreement.\n\nHowever, if you’re smoking in your backyard, and a neighbor tells you to stop, you don’t necessarily have to stop.\n\nHowever, you should be mindful of your neighbor in order to prevent further problems, or possible legal action.\n\nYour neighbor could claim that the health impacts of secondhand smoke warrant a no-smoking policy — even if your cannabis use is for medical purposes.\n\nSmoking in private isn’t a guaranteed right. Be mindful of where your smoke goes and who it affects in order to prevent further complications.\n\nThis article contains updated information from a previous article originally published in September 2023.",

    "title": "Nvidia: A complete guide to the hardware company behind the AI boom",
    "description": "Nvidia is one of the world's most valuable companies. Read about its history, leadership, and financials.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia has been around for over three decades, but the chipmaker became a household name only in the past few years.\n\nIn October 2025, the AI chipmaker became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nNvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, \"with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets.\"\n\nThe boom in AI technology has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world as companies scramble to buy its graphics processing units. Here's what you need to know about Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's origin story began at a Denny's during a meeting between Huang — who once worked for the chain — Malachowsky, and Priem.\n\nPersonal computing was on the cusp of taking off, and the trio sought a way to capitalize on it. Huang said in a 2010 interview with Stanford University's engineering school that they \"wondered whether starting a graphics company would be a good idea.\"\n\n\"We brainstormed and fantasized about what kind of company it would be and the world we could help,\" he said. \"It was fun.\"\n\nTheir goal was to improve the experience of gaming on a PC.\n\nIn 2006, it released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface that would expand its business far beyond gaming.\n\nOn Sequoia Capital's \"Crucible Moments\" podcast, Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor who founded Google Brain, recalled his students telling him, \"Hey, Andrew, there's this thing called CUDA — not that easy to program, but it's letting people use GPUs for something different.\"\n\n\"We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do 1,000 or 10,000 things in parallel rather than one step after another,\" he added.\n\nNvidia's GPUs were used to train AlexNet, an image classification system unveiled in 2012 that significantly influenced the field of deep learning.\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered Nvidia into a new era. The chipmaker's shares surged by more than 1,000% from 2022 to early 2026.\n\nMuch of that growth came from the success of Nvidia's H100 chip, which it released in March 2022. The $40,000 chip, named for the computer scientist Grace Hopper, has played a crucial role in providing the computing power for large language models.\n\nSince the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which are twice as fast as its Hopper chips, customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft have also flocked to the company.\n\nNvidia's success may be best personified by its CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\nA 61-year-old bona fide tech mogul, Huang has a net worth of about $165 billion, according to Forbes. While some execs sport chains or Patagonia vests, Huang is often spotted in a leather jacket. Business Insider identified at least six versions he's worn over the years, including a nearly $9,000 lizard-embossed coat from Tom Ford he wore at the company's global AI conference, GTC, in 2024. He commemorated Nvidia's stock price hitting $100 with a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his arm.\n\nHuang's early years were tumultuous. He was born in Taiwan, and he spent time there and in Thailand before his parents sent him to the United States because of social unrest in the region.\n\nHe attended a reform school in Kentucky. He later moved to Oregon, where he was reunited with his parents. In high school, he became a nationally ranked table tennis champion.\n\nHuang graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1984.\n\nDuring his freshman year, Huang met Lori Mills, his future wife. In an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, he said he won her over by offering to help her with her homework. They married five years after meeting and now have two children.\n\nJensen Huang later earned a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford, and he worked at the chip companies LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices before launching Nvidia.\n\nHuang sold about 1.3 million shares of Nvidia when the company hit a $3 trillion market cap in June 2024, but he retains a more than 3% stake in the company.\n\nNvidia's business is built around GPUs, which can handle tasks simultaneously, as opposed to central processing units, or CPUs, which are in standard computers.\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become a mainstay of the AI revolution because they provide the computing power needed to run massive large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's Llama 3.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's H100 chips, built on its Hopper architecture, has been so high in late 2023 and 2024 that tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have bragged about how many units they're training new technology on. ByteDance has found workarounds to the US export bans on the chips to China. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought up thousands of units to fuel their AI ambitions, while venture capitalists have bought Nvidia GPUs as backup units for their startups.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chips, which it says are twice as fast as its Hopper chips and have attracted customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. The recent frenzy around the Chinese company DeepSeek's models has fueled demand for Nvidia's H200 chips.\n\nIn January 2025, Huang also unveiled new chips targeting the gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicle industries, as well as partnerships with Toyota and Microsoft.\n\nAt the January 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled the new Vera Rubin architecture that will succeed Blackwell. During his presentation, Huang said Vera Rubin is built to confront the core problem of a surge in computing demand.\n\nCompared with Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, Huang said Rubin delivers more than three times the performance, can run inference up to five times faster, and offers significantly higher inference compute per watt.\n\nA key to Nvidia's success is also CUDA, a software layer that can link GPUs to almost any AI application a developer wants to run. It's a critical component of the competitive advantage, or moat, that Nvidia has built up over the years.\n\nStill, AMD, Nvidia's main competitor, is quietly catching up. In October 2025, AMD announced a major multi-year strategic partnership with OpenAI under which OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs for its AI infrastructure starting in the second half of 2026. The deal is expected to bring tens of billions of dollars in revenue to AMD over time.\n\nNvidia's other competitors include Intel and IBM. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have also released their own AI chips.\n\nNvidia overtook Apple and Microsoft for the title of the most valuable company in the world when it hit a historic $5 trillion in market capitalization in October 2025.\n\nAfter a tumultuous start to 2025 over chip export restrictions to China that would have cost billions in losses for Nvidia, Nvidia is heading into 2026 with confidence that demand for its AI chips is far from peaking.\n\nIn 2025, the chipmaker's blockbuster third-quarter results brought in $57 billion in revenue, including $51 billion from its data center business alone, beating Wall Street expectations. Nvidia raised its fourth-quarter forecast to $65 billion in sales, helping revive AI and semiconductor stocks after a brief slump. Shares of Nvidia and peers rallied on the upbeat outlook.\n\nHuang repeatedly dismissed fears of an AI bubble, arguing that the shift from CPUs to GPUs, the rise of agentic AI, and monetization through advertising all point to sustained growth. Nvidia also expanded its influence through major partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and hyperscalers such as Meta.\n\nLooking to 2026, Nvidia is betting big on next-generation chips like Blackwell Ultra, massive AI infrastructure projects, and growth areas including robotics and automotive. While US export restrictions on China remain a headwind, Nvidia expects hyperscalers and global AI investment to keep demand strong into next year.\n\nNvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia's headquarters, known as Voyager, was designed by the architectural firm Gensler and is about 750,000 square feet.\n\nIt has parks, \"treehouses\" for gatherings, and places designed to help employees focus. However, the overall design is intended to facilitate Nvidia's flat organizational structure.\n\n\"When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible,\" Huang told the Harvard Business Review in 2023.\n\nIt's also a way to create more harmony between leadership and workers. Huang, who in 2023 oversaw 50 direct reports, has said that CEOs \"by definition\" should have the most direct reports at a company.\n\nHuang has earned a reputation among those who work with him as a demanding boss. Meetings with Huang can get heated, and senior employees have described his tough questions as a \"Jensen grilling.\"\n\nNvidia's top executives include Ian Buck, a vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing; Colette Kress, the chief financial officer; and Bryan Catanzaro, a vice president of applied deep learning research.\n\nLanding a job at Nvidia isn't easy, but Lindsey Duran, a VP of recruitment, told BI that Nvidia applicants should express an interest in generative AI, tap into their professional network for referrals, and aim to do an internship.",

Even when I was given a chance to sit down and learn the family business full time, I told myself it would only be temporary.\n\nI had plenty of peers who planned from the get-go to take over their parents' companies, but not me. Still, my mother was determined to have me learn the ins and outs, no matter what I may end up doing in the future.\n\nNow that I've been a full-time employee for seven years, I've learned the intricacies of our family business. It isn't easy, but working with my family has made me appreciate everything I grew up with and the professional skills I've gained.\n\nMy mom started the companies I now work for in her early 30s. Starting out as a real estate agent, she learned that many of the properties she listed had underground or basement heating oil tanks that needed to be removed and replaced. Instead of coordinating multiple contractors, she started her first company to become a one-stop shop for the entire project. As many of her clients now had new oil tanks, she also started a company to provide oil and service for their heating equipment. The one-stop shop got a bit bigger with the newest addition.\n\nSince my mother has been an entrepreneur her entire life, it's all my sister and I have ever known. There are many pictures of our mom on job sites while pregnant or with us in strollers, watching the excavators and trailers go by.\n\nMany of the people who worked in the office felt like family, as I grew up stopping in with my mom and dad after school so they could wrap up their days.\n\nAt home, at work, or anywhere we may go, Mom is the boss. I didn't even know that HVAC and construction were male-dominated fields until my teens because every colleague she had did exactly what she said with little to no questioning.\n\nAs a kid, I would help clean the offices on the weekends. When I was in college, I worked in the office during my summer break. I got to learn just how the daily operations I'd heard about and seen my entire life.\n\nI started answering phones, sending out marketing mailers, and gradually taking on more of the responsibilities my older sister had handled years earlier.\n\nAfter college, I started working full-time at my mother's company as an office assistant. Now, I'm a coordinator for job sales, contract writing, bookkeeping, scheduling, and an ongoing list of administrative tasks that keep the businesses running.\n\nAlthough I never pictured myself working here full time, I try to look on the bright side. I left college not wanting to pursue the degree I ended up with, but I'm still able to support myself and my loved ones while I determine the new path I want to take.\n\nPeople often ask me if I enjoy working with my immediate family every day. I'd be lying if I said it didn't have its benefits, like the job security and ease of taking time for family matters.\n\nBut it also, of course, comes with an array of challenges.\n\nHaving my older sister directly over me as the office manager means that when things get frustrating, she easily treats me like the baby brother. Stern though she may be, she's always got the right answer and is sure I don't make the same mistakes twice. Like our mother, she commands a room's attention and reminds everyone exactly who's in charge at that moment.\n\nSure, it is tough to ask my mom for time off without her prying into my personal life to find out why, but my family has always reinforced the value of hard work, dedication, and an unshakable work ethic. I'm learning from the best.\n\nBeing able to work with my family is one of the luckiest lots in life I could have pulled. The frustrations are real, and the challenges of a small (but mighty) set of family businesses are ever-present.\n\nHowever, I can never deny the privilege of learning and growing with the ones I love. I'm not sure how long I'll work in the family business, but I feel prepared for whatever path I may walk next — with a strong base of support behind me.",

    "fullText": "Love was certainly in the air this Valentine's Day as \"Stranger Things\" star Maya Hawke married musician Christian Lee Hutson on Saturday.\n\nThe duo tied the knot at St. George's Episcopal Church in New York City. Guests included Hawke's celebrity parents, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke, and Maya's fellow \"Stranger Things\" stars, including Sadie Sink, Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin, Joe Keery, Gaten Matarazzo, and Natalie Dyer, according to People.\n\nHawke, 27, and Hutson, 35, were first sighted together in 2023. The two have since collaborated on music projects, including Hawke's second studio album \"Moss,\" and she sings on Hutson's latest album \"Paradise Pop. 10.\"\n\nHere's everything we know about Christian Lee Hutson\n\nHutson was born in Kansas City, Missouri, but was raised in Los Angeles, where he's lived since he was 5.\n\nHe began playing guitar at 12 and was influenced by Hank Williams and Elliott Smith.\n\nHutson forged a country-folk sound in the early 2010s while part of The Driftwood Singers, a group composed of students from the California Institute of the Arts.\n\nHe then went solo and released two albums that didn't get much attention. Then everything changed in 2018 when he met Phoebe Bridgers. The Grammy-winner has since been Hutson's producer and main collaborator, which led to his first major album, 2020's \"Beginners,\" and follow-ups \"Quitters\" in 2022 and \"Paradise Pop. 10,\" in 2024, which Hawke is featured on.\n\nThe couple was first seen together in December 2023, but they had already collaborated musically for years prior.\n\nHutson wrote on Hawke's second album, \"Moss\" (2022). The \"Inside Out 2\" star talked about working with Hutson in a 2021 Interview Magazine chat with Margaret Qualley.\n\n\"And I sent him some poems, and he sent me back some unbelievable songs,\" Hawke said.\n\nThe two have since collaborated on Hawke's 2024 album \"Chaos Angel,\" Hutson's latest album \"Paradise Pop. 10,\" and performed live together.\n\nThe couple became red carpet official in April 2025 when they smiled for cameras at the opening night of \"John Proctor Is the Villain,\" which starred Hawke's \"Stranger Things\" castmate, Sadie Sink.\n\nA week later, Hawke was seen wearing what appeared to be an engagement ring on her ring finger, according to People.",

    "fullText": "OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger joined OpenAI, according to an X post by Sam Altman on February 15. But before that, Steinberger got feedback on his product from Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nOpenClaw is an open-source AI agent that can autonomously handle tasks like managing email, booking flights, and interacting with apps and services on a user's behalf.\n\n\"Many people are calling this one of the biggest moments in the recent history of AI, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022,\" Lex Fridman said about OpenClaw on the February 11 episode of his podcast, where he interviewed Steinberger.\n\nSteinberger discussed acquisition offers from both OpenAI and Meta on the podcast, saying he also considered raising venture capital but ultimately ruled it out. \"Been there, done that,\" he said of starting a company, adding that it would take time away from building and could create conflicts of interest between a commercial product and the open-source project.\n\nInstead, he narrowed his choice to the two AI labs, which he said made very different pitches. He said OpenAI lured him with compute power and access to cutting-edge infrastructure, while Meta's approach was more personal — Zuckerberg spent a week using OpenClaw and sent detailed feedback.\n\n\"Mark basically played all week with my product and sent me like, 'Oh, this is great.' Or, 'This is shit. Oh, I need to change this.' Or, like, funny little anecdotes,\" Steinberger said of Zuckerberg, adding that he hopped on a WhatsApp call with the Meta CEO where they debated about Claude Code and Codex.\n\n\"And then I think afterwards he called me eccentric but brilliant,\" Steinberger said.\n\nJust before the call, Zuckerberg said he was coding, Steinberger told Fridman on the podcast.\n\n\"He didn't drift away in just being a manager; he gets me,\" Steinberger said. \"That was a good first start.\"\n\nSteinberger said he appreciated Zuckerberg testing the product on Fridman's podcast.\n\n\"People using your stuff is kind of like the biggest compliment, and also shows me that they actually care about it,\" Steinberger said.\n\nSteinberger acknowledged on the podcast that he was leaning toward one company but declined to say which. His choice, it seems, was OpenAI.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI announced on Sunday it had hired Peter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw. Within hours, the news sent ripples across the AI community, drawing praise from some executives, jabs from rivals, and a flood of memes from engineers watching the talent wars unfold.\n\nSteinberger wrote in a blog post shared on X Sunday that he was \"joining OpenAI to work on bringing agents to everyone.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman amplified the news, writing that \"the future is going to be extremely multi-agent.\"\n\nPeter Steinberger is joining OpenAI to drive the next generation of personal agents. He is a genius with a lot of amazing ideas about the future of very smart agents interacting with each other to do very useful things for people. We expect this will quickly become core to our…\n\nIn response to the news, several OpenAI leaders welcomed Steinberger. Thibault Sottiaux, an engineering lead on OpenAI's Codex team, wrote that \"@steipete is proof you can just build things.\"\n\n@steipete is proof you can just build things\n\nAnother Codex engineer posted that one of the \"neat\" parts of OpenAI's culture is how many former founders work there.\n\nOne thing @steipete and I talked about over lunch last week was how many former founders are at OpenAI. It’s a really neat part of the culture.\n\nSteinberger told Lex Friedman in a podcast last week that both Mark Zuckerberg and Altman had made him offers.\n\nOpenClaw and its agent-only social media network Moltbook became wildly popular earlier this year as developers and AI enthusiasts shared clips of autonomous AI agents posting, replying, and interacting online. The open-source project, which demonstrates how networks of AI agents can coordinate to perform tasks across apps, also rapidly gained traction on GitHub.\n\nAfter Steinberger's announcement on Sunday, some of the people who worked on OpenClaw commented on the news.\n\n\"I know the decision was not an easy one, and I saw firsthand the pressure Peter was under, given that he understands how fundamental this could be for the AI timeline,\" Jamieson O'Reilly, an OpenClaw advisor, wrote on X in a post congratulating Steinberger.\n\nOne thing has become very clear to me working together with @steipete on @openclaw.\n\nWhile lots of people spectate from the sidelines, sharing their opinions, concerns and even hot takes at times, the dude is there, vigilantly on the front-lines pushing AI forward for every one… https://t.co/fe5OEKgevm\n\nAaron Levie, the CEO of Box, said it was a sign \"2026 was the year of the agents.\"\n\nIf anyone was wondering if 2026 was the year of agents, OpenAI is bringing on the maker of Openclaw. This space is about to get very real. https://t.co/ocqX4kE9PT\n\nNot everyone in the tech space was as enthusiastic about the news.\n\nXAI cofounder Igor Babuschkin asked users on X: \"What's the best open alternative to OpenClaw right now? Doesn't make sense to put all your data into it if it's owned by OpenAI.\"\n\nPayPal mafia member Jason Calacanis expressed similar concerns.\n\n😔 what are the chances the open source project survives / thrives after this? https://t.co/4sUZkKWkGh\n\nSteinberger and OpenAI have said that OpenClaw will remain an open-source project with OpenAI's support.\n\nOther experts in the space pointed out that OpenAI's win could be a loss for Anthropic, especially after Steinberger wrote on X that Anthropic sent \"love letters from legal.\"\n\n\"Another interesting detail is Anthropic's visible disdain for anything open \n\nKris Puckett, a designer at Stripe, expressed a similar sentiment\n\nInstead of @AnthropicAI getting Claudebot, they rushed legal to send a C&D and lost out on not only brilliant talent but community drive. \n\nTruly would love to know the decision making process.\n\nRaphael Schaad, a visiting partner at Y Combinator, said, \"I bet this causes lots of VC tears.\"\n\nI bet this causes lots of VC tears and angry OSS folks. But think about this:\n\n- Peter showed the future and lots of awesome startups are starting to bloom from this. Invest in those!\n\n- Peter created one of the most exciting OSS projects in years.

    "fullText": "At $11 billion AI startup ElevenLabs, the message to sales reps is simple: Hit 20x your base salary, or you're out.\n\nSpeaking on the 20VC podcast on Friday, Carles Reina, VP of sales at the voice-cloning startup, talked through its \"ruthless\" quotas.\n\n\"So if I pay you $100,000 a year, your quota is $2 million. That's it. If you don't achieve your quota, then you're going to be out, right?\" Reina said. \"And we're ruthless on that end.\"\n\nElevenLabs — which was recently valued at $11 billion after closing a $500 million funding round — operates in micro-teams of five to ten people each, according to CEO and cofounder Mati Staniszewski, who spoke on a separate 20VC podcast episode in September.\n\nReina said he prefers to operate in smaller teams that hit their quotas, and pay them more.\n\nSmall teams have become a growing trend in tech, with AI startups touting their ability to scale with far fewer employees by working alongside AI agents.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman wrote in January that a team of 15 people using AI can rival a team of 150 who aren't.\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg said on a Meta earnings call in July that he has \"gotten a little bit more convinced around the ability for small, talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research.\"\n\nReina said the \"ruthless\" quota has been successful at ElevenLabs, saying on the 20VC podcast that more than 80% of reps hit their sales quota.\n\nElevenLabs did not respond to a request for a comment.\n\nHe added that the firm compensates both the account executive and customer success manager if they upsell a company within the first 12 months.\n\n\"I'm paying double, but I don't care,\" Reina said. \"It makes perfect sense because then I have these two people busting their ass to make sure that they actually can make more money, which is fantastic for me as a company.\"\n\nThe push for higher performance isn't limited to AI startups.\n\nIn April, Google said it was restructuring its compensation structure to increase rewards for top performers. \"High performance is more important than ever,\" Google's head of compensation told staff at the time.",

    "description": "A former banker and his lifelong friend turned a franchise obsession into owning Capriotti's and running the sandwich chain together.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ashley Morris, CEO of Capriotti's. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy whole career is based on a love affair with food — and a lifelong friendship. I grew up on the West Coast, but had tried cheesesteaks on trips east, and adored them. In college, I was living with Jason, who has been my best friend since we were 10. One day, he came home talking about the best sandwich he'd ever eaten. He told me I had to go to Capriotti's.\n\nI was busy, studying finance and working at a bank. By that Friday, when I still hadn't gone, Jason dragged me to the sandwich shop. I was just as blown away as he was. I'd eaten a lot of cheesesteaks, but this was the best of the best. It was true love.\n\nJason and I went to Capriotti's so much that when we needed a new apartment, we chose one further from school, but closer to the restaurant. That was the first sign of the role Capriotti's would play in our lives.\n\nI started working as a bank teller at Wells Fargo when I was 18 because it was the only finance job they'd let me do at that age. After I graduated from college, I moved to the financial services team, and by the time I was 25, I was earning more than any young kid should: about half a million a year.\n\nJason and I had always wanted to get into business together, and now I had the financial resources to make that a reality. We decided to spend a week thinking about business ideas, then decide what to do. When the meeting came, we each brought one idea: open a Capriotti's franchise.\n\nWe planned to be 50/50 business partners while both maintaining our day jobs. I would put in more capital, and Jason would do more of the hands-on work, while keeping his government job.\n\nHowever, we quickly learned that running a passive business just isn't a reality. The restaurant wasn't going to be a side hustle, especially because we were so cocky that we opened two franchises at the same time. Before long, we had a third. My girlfriend at the time (now wife) handled a lot of the operations, while Jason and I supported her as much as we could.\n\nWe wanted to own 10 restaurants, but we started butting heads with Capriotti's CEO. I thought she had an old-fashioned mindset, and each time we asked to open another location, she said no.\n\nAfter a year of that, I'd had enough. I realized if I waited for her to say yes, I'd be 40 and not living my dream. After speaking with Jason, I told the CEO we wanted to buy the whole company. It took everything Jason and I had, but we purchased Capriotti's in 2008, when I was 27.\n\nWe've been running the company together since — Jason's the CEO and I'm the president. We have a lot of the same values, probably because we forged them growing up together. We know each other inside and out, like brothers. That allows us to give really honest feedback. Jason has no problem walking into my office and saying, \"You're missing the boat on this one,\" and instead of getting defensive, I immediately open my mind to what he has to say.\n\nWhen we decided to buy the business, we established commandments to make sure our business partnership wouldn't ruin our friendship. First, there's a hierarchy: if we reach an impasse on a decision, I have the final say. That's only happened twice, and Jason has graciously accepted my decision.\n\nOur second commandment is that if either of us wants out, the other must be fully committed to helping him exit. Luckily, we've never had to use that, but we know that we could part ways amicably, fairly, and with integrity if we wanted to.\n\nToday, Jason's four boys are close with my sons and daughter. We all went on vacation together for New Year's. Life is busy, and it's not always easy to find time together outside work, but we try. It's wonderful to see our friendship recreated with our kids.",

    "description": "From nail-biting elections to would-be assassinations, American history is full of presidential what-ifs. Here are 10 of the most notable examples.",
    "fullText": "From Washington to Trump, 45 distinguished Americans are immortalized on lists displayed in history classrooms across the United States.\n\nBut as US history shows, securing a spot on this coveted list is often a roll of the dice.\n\nFour presidents in American history have been assassinated, while another four have died of natural causes while in office. Richard Nixon's infamous resignation brings the total to nine commanders in chief who didn't finish out their terms — a number that, as we'll see below, could've been higher.\n\nThere have also been a handful of elections decided by razor-thin margins, meaning the presidency was sometimes decided by a thousand votes or less in certain states.\n\nBetween vice presidents who would've assumed the presidency from potential assassinations or impeachments and candidates who just barely missed the cut, a host of different faces could've been in the Oval Office, leading us to wonder how different US history could have looked.\n\nHere are 10 almost-presidents in the nation's history.\n\nThough a little-known figure by historical standards, Connecticut Senator Lafayette S. Foster was nearly catapulted into the White House on April 14, 1865, the night Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. Foster served as president pro tempore of the United States Senate, a position that was second in the presidential line of succession at the time.\n\nAs part of the plot to murder Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth's conspirator George Atzerodt was set to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson, but Atzerodt got cold feet right before the operation, PBS reported. Had he completed his plan, Foster would have become the acting president.\n\nFoster was a lifelong politician who opposed slavery during his Senate tenure. He remained first in the presidential line of succession for two years under Johnson's term while the vice presidency was vacant, leading some to informally dub him \"acting vice president,\" according to the US Senate.\n\nJohnson also averted being removed from office by a single vote during his presidency. After he was impeached by the House of Representatives for \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in 1868, the articles failed in the Senate.\n\nHad one senator voted differently, Senator Benjamin Wade, the president pro tempore of the United States Senate, would have assumed office.\n\nWith tensions high during the initial years of Reconstruction following the Civil War, Johnson's removal from office would've been a significant action. Had Wade, a Radical Republican, ascended to the presidency, it could've drastically changed the postwar political landscape and the fate of Reconstruction in the South.\n\nAccording to the US Senate, Wade was strongly in favor of women's suffrage and civil rights for African Americans. The Ohio native worked as a laborer and lawyer before entering politics. Following tenure in the Senate, Wade remained active in politics before his death in 1878.\n\nThe 1876 US presidential election was one of the most contentious elections in US history. According to the House of Representatives, with many states' electoral votes disputed, Congress instituted an Electoral Commission to decide the result of the election.\n\nUltimately, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was awarded the presidency, beating Samuel J. Tilden by one electoral vote but losing the popular vote by three percentage points.\n\nTilden was born into a wealthy New York family and eventually worked his way up to governor of New York. An anti-slavery Democrat, he centered his presidential campaign platform around support for the gold standard.\n\nTilden flirted with presidential runs in 1880 and 1884, but ultimately declined the opportunity.\n\nOne of the closest elections in American history came down to just 1,047 votes.\n\nA scandal involving Democratic candidate Grover Cleveland emerged when the Buffalo Evening Telegraph alleged he had fathered a child out of wedlock. As a result, the 1884 US presidential election proved to be a nail-biter.\n\nThe contest came down to New York's 36 electoral votes, with Cleveland edging out Senator James G. Blaine from Maine by just 1,047 votes, around 0.09% of the state's electorate.\n\nBlaine was a prominent figure in the national Republican party, serving as speaker of the House, a senator, and secretary of state under three presidents before and after his 1884 presidential run, according to the Department of State.\n\nIn 1919, President Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke that left half his body paralyzed and largely rendered him unable to fully perform his duties as president. In the remaining two years of his presidency, Wilson suffered bouts of influenza and a urinary-tract infection that threatened his life, PBS reported.\n\nThe 25th Amendment, which outlines clear directives on presidential incapacitation, wasn't ratified until 1967. This meant that Vice President Thomas R. Marshall didn't assume presidential duties at any time, and the first lady, Edith Wilson, took on a large role in the Oval Office.\n\nUnder the scenario in which Wilson succumbed to his poor health, Marshall would've risen to commander in chief. Before his vice presidency, Marshall served as governor of Indiana. He later sought a presidential run in 1920, but wasn't able to draw enough support.\n\nHe died in 1925, just one year after Wilson.\n\nNearly 12 years before Franklin D. Roosevelt would die of natural causes in office, he was almost assassinated before his presidency even began.\n\nOn February 15, 1933, just weeks before FDR's inauguration, Italian immigrant Giuseppe Zangara fired at a car in which the president was giving a speech, The Washington Post reported.\n\nHad FDR been killed, Vice President-Elect John Nance Garner would've assumed the presidency in his place under the terms of the recently ratified 20th Amendment.\n\nAn unlikely running mate for FDR, Garner was a conservative Democrat who represented Texas in the US House of Representatives. Had Garner been president, the government's New Deal programs and its response to World War II might have looked a lot different.\n\nAfter leaving the vice presidency, Garner retired and lived until the age of 98.\n\nWhen FDR was nominated for an unprecedented third term in 1940, he chose Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace as his running mate. With the president's health deteriorating as his term went on, it seemed that FDR's 1944 running mate would be his successor.\n\nDespite leading on the first ballot with a strong base of supporters at the 1944 Democratic National Convention, Wallace was leapfrogged by Harry Truman for the vice-presidential nomination when party leaders worked to rally support for him, according to the Truman Library Institute.\n\nThis would prove to be a consequential choice, as Truman would soon be overseeing the conclusion of World War II and giving orders to drop atomic bombs on Japan.\n\nA native of Iowa, Wallace was a farmer before becoming active in politics and eventually serving in FDR's administration. Following his vice presidency, he returned to a cabinet position under FDR, this time as secretary of commerce.\n\nIn 1948, Wallace launched an unsuccessful presidential bid on the Progressive Party ticket, PBS reported.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest presidential hypotheticals in history, Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated before he got to see his presidential ambitions fully realized.\n\nOn June 5, 1968, Kennedy was fatally shot in Los Angeles just after pulling into second place in the race for the Democratic nomination. Richard Nixon's election to the presidency later that year proved to be consequential, with Nixon escalating the war in Vietnam and ordering bombing campaigns in Laos and Cambodia before resigning in disgrace in 1974.\n\nWhile RFK's chances of being nominated by the Democratic Party and later elected president are still debated by historians, the senator and attorney general left a generation asking, \"What if?\"\n\nNixon's resignation meant that the role of commander in chief would ultimately be assumed by his vice president, and for most of Nixon's tenure, that was Spiro Agnew.\n\nAgnew served as governor of Maryland before being chosen as Nixon's running mate. The former governor's time in the White House was cut short, however, when a Justice Department investigation alleged bribery and extortion. Agnew pleaded no contest to a tax evasion charge, avoided jail time, and promptly resigned from office, The New York Times reported.\n\nGerald Ford was nominated for the vice presidency in his place and within a year was sworn in as president following Nixon's resignation.\n\nAccording to the National Governors Association, Agnew was disbarred after his resignation, and worked in business until his death in 1996.\n\nThe 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore marked the fourth time in US history that the candidate who won the popular vote lost in the electoral college.\n\nThis time, the race came down to Florida, with a recount triggered after the state was still undecided on election night. Following a lengthy process to determine a winner in the state, the US Supreme Court effectively put an end to the recount process, according to NPR. Bush was declared the winner by a margin of just 537 votes.\n\nBush's presidency was defined by major events, from the September 11 attacks to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Hurricane Katrina, and the 2008 financial crisis. The decisions of a few hundred voters in Florida — and the Supreme Court — proved to be consequential in deciding the leader who would oversee all of them.\n\nGore represented Tennessee in both the House and Senate before serving as vice president under Bill Clinton. Since then, he's been a loud advocate for environmentalism and combating climate change.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Death and taxes may be inevitable. A big bill for your heirs is not.\n\nThe rich have made an art of avoiding taxes and making sure their wealth passes down effortlessly to the next generation. But the tricks they use – to expedite payouts to heirs and avoid handing money to the government – can also work for people with far more modest estates.\n\nWhat estate planning strategies do wealthy families use?\n\nWhat is the step-up rule for inherited stocks?\n\nHow can trusts help non-wealthy families avoid probate?\n\nHow do beneficiary designations simplify asset transfers?\n\n“It’s a strategic game of chess played over decades,” says Mark Bosler, an estate planning attorney in Troy, Michigan, and legal adviser to Real Estate Bees. “While the average person relies on a simple will, the well-to-do utilize a different playbook.”\n\nFirst, consider the facts: Despite widespread misconceptions, only estates of the very richest Americans are generally subject to taxes. At the federal level, estates of over $15 million typically trigger taxes. At the state level, 16 states and the District of Columbia do collect estate or inheritance taxes, according to the Tax Foundation, sometimes with lower exemptions than the IRS, but still at thresholds targeting millionaires.\n\nWhile most people can pass on what they have without worrying about their heirs being caught in a web of taxes, it can require planning to escape a messy process that can hold up estates for years and cost families significantly in court fees and lawyer bills.\n\nThe solution at the center of many estate planners’ designs is a trust.\n\nThough trusts conjure images of complex arrangements utilized by the uber-rich, they are relatively simple tools that can make sense for many people. They come with expense, often costing thousands of dollars in lawyer fees to set them up. But for a retired couple with a paid-off house, 401(k)s and a portfolio of investments, they can ease the passing of assets to heirs.\n\nAmong the reasons: Even if you aren’t leaving enough behind to trigger taxes, your estate can get tied up in probate court, which typically assesses fees based on an estate's total value.\n\n“You are leaving what might have gone to your children or other loved ones to attorneys and the courts,” says Renee Fry, CEO of Gentreo, an online estate planner based in Quincy, Massachusetts. “Anywhere from 3 to 8% of an estate might be lost.”\n\nTrusts can allow an estate to sidestep court altogether and to shield it from public view by keeping details out of public records. Some people also use them to protect their savings if they someday need nursing home care and would prefer to qualify for a government-paid stay under Medicaid instead of paying themselves.\n\nImagine being an investor in a stock like Nvidia that has soared in recent years. Now imagine being able to reap the profit of selling your shares without paying tax.",

    "fullText": "A popular restaurant chain says it plans to close hundreds of locations this year.\n\nWendy’s said Friday it will close between 5% and 6% of its restaurants in the first half of 2026, according to Fast Company. That would be about 300 restaurants, as the fast food giant had 5,969 U.S. locations at the end of 2025, according to its last earnings report.\n\nCNN reports Wendy’s closed 28 stores during the fourth quarter as part of a previously announced turnaround plan. Interim CEO Ken Cook said the company has decided to shutter additional “consistently underperforming restaurants,” encouraging Wendy’s franchisees to focus on locations that may return more profit.\n\nA list of affected locations has not been announced. Wendy’s currently has 234 restaurants in New York state, including five in Syracuse, according to its website.\n\nWendy’s fourth quarter report released Feb. 13 said same-store sales fell 10.1%, largely due to poor performance in the U.S. where same-store sales were down 11.3%.\n\n“Our fourth quarter performance was in line with our expectations, reflecting the challenges we anticipated,” Cook said. “We are making progress against our 'Project Fresh’ turnaround plan in the U.S. and continue to deliver strong growth internationally.“\n\nCook added that the company is “encouraged” by its new chicken tenders, a.k.a. “Tendys,” and increased focus on everyday value offerings over limited-time menu promotions. CNN reports Wendy’s expanded its Biggie meal offerings last month to include $4 Biggie Bites, a $6 Biggie Bag and an $8 Biggie Bundle, targeting customers on a budget.\n\nMultiple food service businesses have struggled in recent years due to increased competition, inflation or ownership changes. Other restaurants that have filed for bankruptcy or closed multiple locations in recent years include Denny’s, Red Lobster, TGI Friday’s, Hooters, and Pizza Hut.\n\nWilliam Stern, founder of San Diego-based fintech firm Cardiff, told the New York Post that restaurants raised their prices too much in recent years, costing them customers in the long run.\n\n“For two years, these companies treated the customer like an infinite ATM,” Stern said. “Just raising prices every quarter to pad the margins. Well the ATM is empty now. You can only squeeze people so hard before they stop showing up.”\n\nWendy’s previously closed about 140 locations in 2024.",

    "fullText": "ROJ CAMP, Syria (AP) — Syrian authorities turned back a group of Australian women and children on Monday after they left a camp in Syria housing people with alleged ties to Islamic State militants in an attempt to head back to their home country.\n\nIt was not clear if or when they would be able to complete their journey.\n\nThe 34 women and children from 11 families were supposed to make their way from Roj camp to the Syrian capital, Damascus, and then fly to Australia. Relatives of the returnees had been coordinating with Syrian authorities and had traveled from Australia to accompany them, camp officials said.\n\nRashid Omar, an administrator at the camp, said about an hour after departing the remote camp near the border with Iraq, the families were contacted by officials in Damascus who told them that the procedures for their departure were not complete and that they would not be able to travel. The families then returned to the camp.\n\nHakmiyeh Ibrahim, the camp's director, said the planned repatriations were organized by family members of the returnees rather than directly by Australian authorities.\n\nAustralian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nRoj camp houses about 2,200 people from around 50 nationalities, mostly women and children, who have supposed links to the extremist group. Most in the camp are not technically prisoners and have not been accused of a crime, but they have, in effect, been detained in the heavily guarded camp, controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nThe most well-known resident of the Roj camp, Shamima Begum, was 15 when she and two other girls fled from London in 2015 to marry IS fighters in Syria. Begum married a Dutch man fighting for IS and had three children, who all died. She recently lost an appeal against the British government’s decision to revoke her U.K. citizenship.\n\nThe fate of the Roj camp and the similar but larger al-Hol camp has been a matter of debate for years. Human rights groups have cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the camps, but many countries have been reluctant to take back their citizens who are detained there.\n\nMonday’s repatriation, if completed, would have been the first this year. Ibrahim, the camp director, said 16 families were repatriated last year, including German, British and French nationals. In 2022, three Australian families were repatriated.\n\nGovernment forces took control of al-Hol camp last month amid fighting with the SDF that led to state forces seizing most of the territory in northeast Syria previously controlled by the Kurdish forces.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency said Sunday that a large number of residents of al-Hol camp have left and that the Syrian government plans to relocate those who remain.\n\nSeparately, thousands of accused IS militants who were held in detention centers in northeastern Syria have been transferred to Iraq by the U.S. military to stand trial there.",

    "fullText": "Cain Velasquez is a free man. The former two-time UFC heavyweight champion was released from prison Sunday after serving the past 11 months behind bars after a controversial 2022 shooting conviction.\n\nVelasquez, 43, was sentenced to five years in a San Jose, California, prison on March 24, 2025, after being convicted of attempted murder and other charges, ending a three-year saga that was repeatedly delayed in the courts and ignited widespread outrage within the mixed martial arts community. Velasquez's sentence included time served; the former champ spent nearly one year incarcerated following the 2022 incident, as well as nearly two years on house arrest with an ankle monitor.\n\n🚨 Former UFC champ Cain Velasquez was just released from prison \n\nHe served time after firing shots at a vehicle carrying a man accused of molesting his 4-year-old son in 2022 \n\nGreeted by his family and a mariachi band 🙌 pic.twitter.com/0LJ85tnWvD\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) February 15, 2026\n\nVelasquez initially faced 10 felony charges after engaging in an 11-mile high-speed car chase with Harry Goularte, who remains accused of molesting Velasquez's then 4-year-old son on “multiple occasions.\" Velasquez fired several shots through his windshield from a .40-caliber handgun during the chase into a car carrying Goularte, Goularte's mother and Goularte’s stepfather, Paul Bender, resulting in non-life threatening injuries to Bender due to a gunshot wound to his arm.\n\nVelasquez's 10 charges ranged from attempted murder, shooting at a motor vehicle or aircraft, assault with a firearm, assault with a deadly weapon, willfully discharging a firearm from a vehicle and carrying a loaded firearm with intent to commit a felony. Velasquez pleaded no contest to all charges.\n\nGoularte currently awaits a March 9 start date for his own trial after pleading not guilty to one felony charge of lewd acts with a minor.\n\nVelasquez's family has filed a separate civil lawsuit against the Goularte family and its businesses.\n\nPrior to his incarceration, Velasquez expressed remorse for his actions and accepted whatever punishment came his way. Velasquez also said he had forgiven Goularte’s family for what happened; Goularte’s mother ran the daycare where the alleged molestation happened.\n\n“What I did was not correct,\" Velasquez said. “I understand that. I paid and I’ll pay whatever else as far as what I have to do to pay all that back. I don’t think I can pay that back, but I can always learn from my mistakes and help others. It’s just information that you never know anybody. Trust your kids. Have that open communication with your kids.\n\n“[But] the way that I handled things was not the way to do it. We cannot put the law in our own hands.\"\n\nVelasquez (14-3) is one of the most decorated heavyweights of his era. He first captured the UFC heavyweight title in 2010 with a first-round knockout of Brock Lesnar, then won the belt back again in 2012 with a revenge win over Junior dos Santos. A prodigious talent whose career was perennially snakebitten by injuries, Velasquez defended his championship twice with wins over Antonio Silva and in a trilogy bout against dos Santos, before suffering a 2015 loss to Fabricio Werdum. Velasquez only fought twice more — once in 2016 and once in 2019 — before stepping away from MMA entirely.\n\nVelasquez then briefly pursued professional wrestling and even signed with WWE from 2019-20 before being released from his deal due to financial cuts during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "description": "\"Nobody truly knows who the long-term winners and losers of this extraordinary technology will be,\" Deutsche's Jim Reid wrote this morning.",
    "fullText": "Investors wobbled last week as they worked through the disruption AI is likely to cause across global industries, with further hiccups potentially bubbling through this week. But the reckoning should have been expected, argued Deutsche Bank in a note to clients this morning, because it is a readjustment of perhaps overly optimistic expectations.\n\nSoftware stocks in particular suffered a wipeout amid mounting concerns that large language models may replace current service offerings. Companies in the legal, IT, consulting and logistics sectors were also impacted. JP Morgan wrote last week that some $2 trillion had been wiped off software market caps alone as a result, a reality that prior to a fortnight ago, Deutsche’s Jim Reid argued had been purely academic. \n\nA 13-figure sell-off is something Reid has speculated over for some time, telling clients: “For months, my published view has been that nobody truly knows who the long term winners and losers of this extraordinary technology will be. Yet as recently as October, markets were implicitly pricing in a world where almost every tech company would come out a winner.\n\nWhy did software stocks suffer major selloffs recently?\n\nWhat caused the $2 trillion market cap wipeout?\n\nWhat makes AI disruption different from past cycles?\n\nHow are experts viewing current AI stock valuations?\n\n“Over recent weeks we’ve seen a more realistic differentiation emerge within tech—but that repricing is now rippling into the broader economy with surprising speed.”\n\nReid hasn’t been alone in his suspicion that investors had perhaps been painting over the entire stock market (and indeed wider economy) with the same, optimistic brush. Some speculators have made broad-stroke arguments that the efficiencies offered by AI will result in wins for the vast majority of companies, while others have argued that while AI is not in a bubble, there are pockets of overoptimism that may burst. \n\nJPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon is of such an opinion, explaining at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit last year: “You should be using it,” (speaking to any business that was listening). But he added a caveat, saying that back in 1996, “the internet was real,” and “you could look at the whole thing like it was a bubble.” Then he broke down the real difference that he sees—between AI, on the one hand, and generative AI, on the other. It’s an important distinction, Dimon said, while adding that “some asset prices are high, in some form of bubble territory.”\n\nIndeed, Jeremy Siegel, Emeritus Professor of Finance at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, argued that such shifts demonstrate investors are “asking the right questions.” Writing for WisdomTree a week ago, where he serves as senior economist, Siegel said: “When companies talk about $200 billion in capital expenditures, markets should scrutinize payback periods, competitive dynamics, and whether durable moats can be built in an environment where technology is evolving at breakneck speed. That tension explains why leadership will continue to rotate even as the secular story remains intact.” \n\nThat said, Reid suggested that the market may be repricing overzealously, arguing the disruption in “old economy” sectors feels overdone: “The real challenge is that even by the end of this year, we still won’t have enough evidence to identify the structural winners and losers with confidence. That leaves plenty of room for investors’ imaginations—both optimistic and pessimistic—to run wild. As such big sentiment swings will continue to be the order of the day.”",

    "fullText": "Countless businesses met their end as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with even larger chains taking a hit as the world shut down. A new study is purporting that several restaurant chains are bouncing back years after the global pandemic, including one that has seen a decline in San Antonio.\n\nThe study, conducted by Restaurant Furniture, looked at Google search trends between 2021 and 2025. Based on the data, the company ranked the 10 chains that saw the biggest jumps in search interest. Oklahoma-based Sonic Drive-In topped the list, with searches reportedly soaring 1,601% over four years. Some might call Sonic the comeback kid, but things look a bit different in the Alamo City.\n\nDespite these findings, the Sonic Drive-In has seen many closures across San Antonio in recent years, with locations on De Zavala Road, Zarzamora Street, Ingram Road, Nacogdoches Road, Pat Booker Road and Culebra Road all closing since 2024, based on previous MySA reporting. At the time of writing, Sonic Drive-In lists 37 locations as still open in San Antonio.\n\nAs for other fast-food chains' comeback stories, the restaurant study had Dunkin' and Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers in the second and third, respectively, followed by In-N-Out Burger and Jimmy John's. In an extended version of the list, Texas-based burger chain Whataburger landed in the No. 15 spot.\n\nThis article originally published at Nation's No. 1 comeback fast-food chain is stumbling in San Antonio.",

    "fullText": "There’s less one month before millions of Americans gain more of that precious daylight. Although it’s still a couple weeks away, it’s time to prepare for Daylight Saving Time.\n\nThis year’s spring DST will take place at 2 a.m. on Sunday, March 8. At that time, clocks will “spring forward” an hour giving most people in the U.S. an extra hour of sunlight in the evening.\n\nDST takes place each year on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday in November.\n\nWhile DST was observed in some areas, the tradition became official in the U.S. in 1966 when the Uniform Time Act of 1966 was passed. The law was amended by The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which extended daylight saving time from March to November, after previously running from April to October.\n\nEach March, Americans are reminded to move their clocks ahead one hour as they “spring forward.” Then in November, the clocks “fall back” an hour, leading to an extra hour of sleep that night. While most electronics will automatically adjust the time, Americans are reminded to change the time of their stove, microwave, car radio, in-home radio and clocks that hang on a wall.\n\nAlthough the practice has been in place for nearly 60 years, there have been several efforts in recent years to end the event. While none of these efforts have succeeded in Congress, a bill was introduced last year that once again called for the end of Daylight Saving Time.\n\nThe bill would have set a permanent standard time and allowed for states with areas exempt from daylight saving time to choose the standard time for those areas. However, the bill stalled in the Senate and will need to be reintroduced in 2026 if it were to become law.",

Visitors can stay for up to 30 days for business, tourism, exchange programs and to visit family and friends.\n\nMost Europeans qualify for visa-free entry, along with some from select countries in other regions including Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.\n\nCitizens of a few other countries, including the United States and Indonesia, can enter for 10 days if they are in transit — meaning they have a ticket departing for a different country than they arrived from.\n\nBusiness executives and tourists have welcomed the change, as the China visa application process can be a relatively cumbersome one.\n\nThe U.K. and Canada are being added following visits to China last month by their prime ministers, Keir Starmer and Mark Carney. Both are relatively new leaders who are trying to revamp ties with Beijing after a downturn in recent years.\n\nFor most countries, the visa-free access expires at the end of this year, but it has been extended in the past.",

The couple allegedly moved into a bank-owned, 7,500-square-foot home on Burning Tree Lane in Bethesda, Maryland last summer without permission from anyone who actually owns it. The property, which is tied to Citigroup through a foreclosure, is valued at approximately $2.3 million.\n\nThe two were ultimately convicted of trespassing and breaking and entering, among other charges, and sentenced to 90 days in jail. During the proceedings, Judge John C. Moffett told Goode she had \"some demented thoughts to justify\" squatting. Despite all this, Goode managed to return to the property after posting a $5,000 cash appeal bond. Within hours of her release, security camera footage showed a woman matching Goode's description strolling across the icy driveway of the Bethesda mansion, wearing an outfit similar to the one she'd worn outside the courthouse.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nMonths earlier, Ian Chen, a 19-year-old college student who lives with his parents next door, noticed what appeared to be a forced entry into the vacant property. He called Montgomery County police.\n\nAccording to Chen, their response was underwhelming. Officers knocked on the door, got no answer, and left. When Chen pressed the issue, a spokesperson for the Montgomery County Police Department told reporters that, because the occupants had been in the home for more than 30 days, they had \"gained residency status,\" meaning their removal would have to be handled through the courts, not by law enforcement.\n\nSo Chen took matters into his own hands. In July 2025, he filed private criminal charges against Goode and Pollard for trespassing and fourth-degree burglary. What followed was nine months of delays, missed court dates, and legal maneuvering that left the neighborhood on edge.",

    "description": "As the UK adds folic acid to supermarket bread, a nutritionist examines whether TikTok health fears are backed by evidence.",
    "fullText": "Fortified foods are marketed as being good for us, helping to plug nutritional gaps that can lead to deficiencies and poor health.\n\nHowever, the government’s recent decision to add folic acid to supermarket bread has become the centre of a heated online debate.\n\nFrom December this year, a new law will see food manufacturers add the synthetic nutrient to non-wholemeal flour, meaning that certain varieties of breads, cakes and other supermarket items will all carry additional fortification.\n\nOnce the rule is in place, it will be mandatory for millers in the UK to add 0.25 mg of folic acid per 100 grams of non-wholemeal wheat flour.\n\nBut what actually is folic acid? Why are people concerned, and is there any truth to the concerns swirling on social media?\n\nTo better understand the conversation, we asked a nutritionist to answer some of the most common questions.\n\nFolic acid is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate, also known as B9.\n\nFolate helps the body to manufacture healthy red blood cells and plays a role in how efficiently our cells divide and grow. It’s naturally found in foods like leafy greens, chickpeas and cruciferous vegetables, with the NHS saying that most adults can get all they need from a healthy diet alone.\n\nIn early pregnancy, having good levels of folate becomes particularly important, as it helps to aid the proper development of the baby's brain, skull and spinal cord.\n\nDuring these weeks and months, it can be more challenging for women to obtain enough folate from diet alone, as the body's requirements increase significantly.\n\nThis is why the NHS recommends that all pregnant women take 400 micrograms of folic acid every day – from before they fall pregnant until their 12-week scan.\n\n\"Folic acid is being added to bread in the UK because folate intakes are still too low in women of childbearing age, and that has real, preventable consequences,\" says Rob Hobson, nutritionist and author of Unprocess Your Life.\n\n\"Around nine in 10 neural tube defects, including spina bifida (a condition where the baby’s spine and spinal cord don’t fully develop in the womb), develop very early in pregnancy – often before many women even know that they’re pregnant.\n\n\"Despite years of advice to take supplements, uptake has been patchy in the UK, particularly among younger women and those from lower-income backgrounds.\"\n\nIn England, a study of nearly half a million women showed that only 31% take a folic acid supplement prior to pregnancy.\n\n\"That’s why fortification exists,\" says Hobson. \"It follows years of evidence review, careful modelling of risks and benefits, and advice from independent scientific bodies.\n\n\"Countries that already fortify flour have consistently seen reductions in neural tube defects, without clear evidence of harm to the wider population.\"\n\nOne recent review that looked at data from multiple countries found a clear link between the introduction of folic acid fortification and a reduction in neural tube defects, with Chile in South America seeing incidences drop by 55% over a decade.\n\nMuch of the online controversy focuses on a gene called \"MTHFR\", which plays a role in how your body metabolises folate.\n\nSome people are concerned that, if you have a mutation of this particular gene, you may be naturally less efficient at processing synthetic folic acid, leading to higher levels of the unmetabolised nutrient in the bloodstream.\n\nOnline, panic has spread around this \"build-up\" of folic acid, with claims being made that it could contribute to everything from immune problems and heightened cancer risk to increased depression and fatigue.\n\nHowever, Hobson believes that these concerns have largely been sensationalised, and are not based on robust scientific evidence.\n\n\"It’s true that variants of the MTHFR gene are common and can slightly affect how folate is processed in the body,\" he clarifies. \"However, the idea that people with these variants can’t safely handle folic acid, or that fortification is harmful at a population level, isn’t supported by good-quality evidence.\n\n\"This argument often comes from unregulated sources online, and it tends to overlook the scale of public health benefit.\"\n\nFears around folic acid and cancer appear to stem from early research looking at high-dose supplementation.\n\nSome early studies suggested that very high intakes of folic acid might be linked to a possible increase in certain cancers. However, a 2013 meta-analysis of randomised trials looked into these concerns, and found that folic acid supplementation didn't significantly increase overall or site-specific cancer risk over a five-year follow-up period.\n\nWhen it comes to your weekly loaf of bread, Hobson says it’s sensible to keep the fortification levels being increased in context.\n\n\"The level of folic acid being added to flour is small and tightly regulated,\" he reminds. \"Even with fortified bread, most people will still be consuming folic acid well below the upper safe intake level. This is very different from taking high-dose supplements.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Claims on social media that fortified bread can 'slow down bodily processes' or 'promote cancer' aren’t backed up by robust human evidence at the levels used in fortification.\n\n\"While very high supplement doses may overwhelm certain pathways in theory, there’s no good evidence that the small amounts used in flour fortification impair metabolism or cause harm in the general population.\"\n\nOf course, if you’re really anxious about the new law and you’re meeting your daily folate requirements through diet alone, you can always opt for wholewheat varieties that aren’t affected by the rule, or try making your own wholemeal sourdough at home. Both are healthy and nutritious ways to increase your fibre intake.\n\nHowever, if you love nothing more than tucking into a white bread sarnie, Hobson believes there’s no immediate reason to panic. \"The bottom line is that fortification isn’t about optimising nutrition for people who already eat well and take supplements,\" he notes.\n\n\"It’s about reducing avoidable birth defects across the population. From a public health perspective, the benefits are clear, the risks have been carefully assessed, and the policy is grounded in decades of evidence.\"",

    "description": "A super Sunday in the Scottish Premiership delivered thrills and spills and leaves the top three covered by just three points.",
    "fullText": "The Scottish Premiership title race is even tighter following a blockbuster Sunday as last-gasp strikes and goal-laden games heaped on more drama in a thrilling tussle at the top.\n\nCeltic's fightback from two goals down at Rugby Park was capped by a winner from Julian Araujo, the third time in a week the defending champions have snatched a vital strike right at the end.\n\nRangers twice found themselves trailing to league leaders Heart of Midlothian at Ibrox but Youssef Chermiti's hat-trick helped Danny Rohl's side to a thumping 4-2 victory.\n\nAnd Motherwell stretched their unbeaten run to eight games with a 2-0 win over Aberdeen that keeps them in contention.\n\nHearts remain out in front on 57 points but their lead has been cut again and they sit just two ahead of Rangers, who are now on 55.\n\nCeltic's latest late show lifted Martin O'Neill's side up to 54 points, while the defending champions have a game in hand, away to Aberdeen, over the sides above them.\n\nMotherwell are a bit further back, 10 points behind the leaders, but also have a game in hand on the top two.\n\nOne quirk of Sunday's action was that none of the goalscorers from the top four were at their clubs last season, when Celtic were already cruising towards the title.\n\nSebastian Tounekti netted for the third time at Rugby Park this season, Benjamin Nygren scored his 16th goal for Celtic since moving in the summer and it was January arrival Araujo who clinched three points.\n\nAt Ibrox, the scoring was opened by Marc Leonard, who only joined Hearts four weeks ago, then Claudio Braga continued his incredible season with another goal.\n\nJanuary signing Ryan Naderi helped force the first Rangers goal, while Youssef Chermiti grabbed the headlines as he continued to answer critics of his big-money move to Ibrox.\n\nThe striker arrived from Everton for an initial £8m but was derided for his early performances. A double in the derby at Celtic Park helped win over some doubters and he has delivered again in a high stakes game.\n\nJackie McNamara sees plenty to like about the Portuguese forward but says he will need to contribute more regularly in the title run-in.\n\n\"The biggest thing is consistency,\" the former Celtic defender told the Scottish Football Podcast. \"Has he got attributes? Yeah, he can move, he's physical, he's good in the air.\n\n\"Technically, he's not brilliant, but he scores a hat-trick, he looked world-class against Celtic in the second half. That was more down to Celtic's defending and in Wilfried Nancy's time.\n\n\"I think if you're going to lead the line for Rangers, you've got to have that every game. You've got have that consistency.\n\n\"You've got to be on the end of everything. He's away with the match ball. So what's his reaction to that now? Strikers are all about confidence, but for him there has to be some kind of consistency there.\"\n\nSportscene: Scottish Premiership highlights\n\nMany predicted the title race would be decided by January recruitment and Michael Stewart has doubts over recent business done at his former club Hearts.\n\n\"When Hearts are missing a few players, it's caused them big problems,\" he told the Scottish Football Podcast. \"I'm not sure about some of the guys that have been brought in. They needed them to come and hit the ground running, and it's definitely not happened.\n\n\"Islam Chesnokov is one we've spoken about a lot and he's played a couple of games now. I've not seen him take a full back on once yet.\n\n\"Ageu's been in since the summer, he's had injury problems, first start. Hearts are a team that have intensity and physicality, and they've got a real threat at top of the park. And I'm not sure that I'm seeing it with those guys. Same with Pierre Landry Kabore.\n\n\"Jordi Altena's come in with a lot of hype, obviously a highly regarded full-back, but I'm not sure that the manager's convinced about him.\"\n\nAt Celtic, probably the most significant January arrival was Martin O'Neill and the manager was full of praise for his side's character at Kilmarnock, comparing them to his successful team from more than two decades ago.\n\nAs a member of that celebrated Celtic side, McNamara knows how inspirational O'Neill can be and he thinks his experience will be key in the weeks to come.\n\n\"Martin's main attributes are in the dressing room,\" he said. \"He's good at the right moments to get a reaction, to get the best out of the players and I think he's had the best of the players in his first spell there after Brendan Rodgers and then he's had to do it again, he's had to chase again after Wilfried Nancy's reign.\n\n\"Had he he been in the whole time, Celtic, for me, would have been clear at the top at this moment.\"\n\nRangers have amassed the most points in the league since Rohl took charge of his first Premiership game on 26 October.\n\nThe win over Hearts was criticial to maintain that momentum, and the Ibrox side now have the best defensive record of the top three sides.\n\nRohl took some stick for his team selection in the 1-1 draw at Motherwell during the week, and raised an eyebrow or two when he suggested a point was a good outcome.\n\nBut as former Rangers midfielder Kevin Thomson told BBC Scotland, his side bounced back in style.\n\n\"He's done a brilliant job,\" Thomson said.\n\n\"He was questioned a bit during the week at Fir Park, conceding late to an excellent Motherwell team.\n\n\"But to bounce back against the league leaders, with Chermiti getting his hat-trick, was the icing on the cake.\n\n\"It's going to be nervy for them all. It changes every week. I do think Rangers are in pole position now to strike. It's there for them.\n\n\"But I certainly wouldn't rule out the other two.\"\n\nThe curious case of Chermiti in Rohl's Rangers revolution\n\nCeltic spirit reminds O'Neill of glory years\n\nVictory at Fir Park kept hopes alive of something truly remarkable for Motherwell, though Jens Berthel Askou was reluctant to make any bold claims about his side's chances.\n\n\"The league is not over,\" he said. \"Whether we are a part of it is for you to discuss.\"\n\nStewart believes it would be wrong to write off a team that has lost fewer games than two of the three above them.\n\nThe Steelmen travel to Celtic and Hearts before the split and their form could yet put them right in the mix.\n\n\"It wasn't just a fascinating weekend of games, there was midweek as well,\" Stewart said. \"You know, it's been two full rounds of games and Motherwell's performance against Rangers was outstanding.\n\n\"Having drawn too many games could be their Achilles heel but they've only lost three. They don't look like conceding goals, don't look like they're going to lose games.\n\n\"When the post-split fixtures come out, it's going to be a bloodbath, really.\"\n\nWho are the favourites to win the Scottish Premiership title after another thrilling weekend at the top?\n\nCeltic fan David: \"Wow that result just goes to show that Celtic have not given up on winning the title this season. Let's hope the players respond for the rest of the season. Big games coming up.\"\n\nHearts supporter Mike: \"Unfortunately our three high profile signings, Ageu, Chesnokov and Kabore were posted missing in the 45 minutes they each played. We are really missing Cammy and Shanks. Rangers are a different team to the one we beat twice already this season. Playing with confidence and probably favourites for the title. However, we are still top and need to win our next matches before the split.\"\n\nMotherwell fan Derek: \"I'm calling on all Motherwell fans to pinch themselves. This is absolutely the best time since the Ancell Babes. In folklore, we've had this team's exploits passed down through the generations. Even the Willie Pettigrew years can't beat this. A trophy would be the icing on the cake. Take a bow, Jens Berthel Aaskou.\"\n\nRangers supporter Chris: \"We have played two of the form teams this week and finished it closer to the top of table than we started. The second half performance against Hearts was as good as we have played this season. But I think the season will likely go down to the wire. They are all big games now.\"\n\nHearts fan Frank: \"To keep our challenge up we need to dispatch Falkirk and Aberdeen next - two of the few clubs who have beaten us this season. Realistically, we are punching above our weight and need the Old Firm to lose nerve, but under their new managers I don't think that's likely.\n\n\"I've enjoyed the ride so far but have never got carried away. If you'd told me at the beginning of the season that we would be disappointed with third place I'd have laughed out loud.\"\n\nRangers fan Elaine: \"At last! A team with some fight about them. Brilliant to see big Youssef Chermitti getting his hat-trick. Now we can believe we are in a title race. If we hadn't gifted Hearts two goals, they never looked like scoring. Now we hunt!\"\n\nCeltic fan Henry: \"Fantastic result at a tricky venue, we have a game in hand and are only three points behind the league leaders. Celtic can still win this league. All the supporters need to get behind the team and stop all this 'sack the board' nonsense.\"\n\nMotherwell fan Stuart: Wasn't the best performance by a long way, but possibly more satisfying to win when not playing as well as we have had in recent games. We were a bit careless in possession and gifted opportunities to Aberdeen, but created some great chances for ourselves. We still need to be more clinical, but I'm living the dream as a Motherwell fan this year - where could we end up?",

    "description": "Slalom skier Dave Ryding bids farewell to the Winter Olympics with a 17th-place finish in mixed conditions in Bormio.",
    "fullText": "Dave Ryding can pinpoint the exact moment he first dreamed of competing at a Winter Olympics.\n\n\"It was actually in a religious education lesson. I'm not sure I was paying enough attention to the teacher.\"\n\nOn Monday, that daydreaming lad from Lancashire raced at his fifth and final Olympics, his retirement imminent at the age of 39 after a career that has cemented his place as Britain's greatest Alpine skier.\n\nRyding - known as 'the Rocket' - finished 17th in the slalom in Bormio, lower than he and anyone would have hoped for but getting to the finish line was a challenge in itself.\n\nThe first run was held in torrid conditions and he was one of only 46 skiers - out of 96 starters - to complete it amid heavy snowfall.\n\nWhile conditions had vastly improved for the second run, with the loose snow cleared and blue skies overhead, he could not make up enough time to challenge for a higher finish, his ninth spot from 2018 remaining his best Olympic result.\n\nBut Ryding still took his moment, bowing after crossing the line.\n\n\"I really tried everything right until my last turn,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I was quoted on the BBC as saying I would ski until my legs fell off and I kind of feel like they have this year.\n\n\"One season maybe too many, but I had to give it a go. I really went in as always and I'm proud.\"\n\nSwitzerland's Loic Meillard won gold for his third medal of the Milan-Cortina Games while Fabio Gstrein of Austria and Norway's Henrik Kristoffersen took silver and bronze respectively.\n\nRyding was one of three Team GB skiers in the race, with Billy Major finishing one place higher in 16th but Laurie Taylor straddled on the first run.\n\n\"As much as I've helped them, they've helped me,\" Ryding said of his team-mates. \"It's over to them, I might have to sign on in a few weeks!\n\n\"It feels right, I feel ready and I'm looking forward to the future.\n\n\"I honestly think the next 15 years of British skiing are taken care of. It will only get more and more exciting.\"\n\nAsked about Ryding as a child, his mum, dad and grandparents all say the same thing: he never stopped.\n\nBut there had to be competition.\n\n\"If there were two snails going up a wall, he'd be betting on his one going up first,\" his grandmother Muriel told Ski Sunday.\n\nHe dabbled in every sport going but it wasn't until he was eight that he first clipped into skis, not in the mountains, but on the dry slope of Pendle Ski Club.\n\nIt became his playground. He did little training on snow until he was 13 though he continued to race on plastic into his early 20s.\n\nRyding had a late breakthrough to the top circuit of the sport, earning his first World Cup points just a few weeks shy of his 26th birthday and not adding any more until two years later.\n\nHe continued to plug away, picking up three podium finishes before he reaped the rewards of his perseverence and resilience in 2022 when, at the age of 35, he became the first Briton, and oldest skier, to win World Cup slalom gold with his victory in Kitzbuhel.\n\n\"It's been incredible to watch his journey and every time he did something, it was like 'wow',\" said his wife Mandy, herself a former skier for the Netherlands.\n\n\"Skiing for Great Britain, not having any mountains, it was just bizarre. First it was a Europa Cup win, then he started making top 30s in the World Cup, World Cup podiums and then he actually won one.\n\n\"Even the guys on the World Cup tour were like, 'How is this possible? He started on dry slopes'. It's out of this world.\"\n\nWhat Ryding credits the longevity of his career with perhaps comes as a surprise - once running a cafe in Tarleton with Mandy.\n\nDevoting his life to slalom had turned his brain \"to cauliflower\" but the \"real world\" had proved to him that the grass wasn't necessarily greener.\n\n\"I realised what I do is really good,\" he said. \"It reignited that love and the passion.\"\n\nFor much of his career, Ryding was a lone wolf. The key thing missing, for him, was a pack.\n\nIt is no coincidence then that Ryding saw an uptick in his results when Taylor and Major joined him on the World Cup circuit.\n\nSince 2022, the year the trio formed a British 'team' in an otherwise individual sport, Ryding achieved four more World Cup podiums, including that Kitzbuhel win.\n\n\"The next generation really believes and talks about podiums like it's a normal thing,\" Ryding told Ski Sunday before the Games.\n\n\"To be ranked in the top 30 for 11 years and the top 15 for nine years, it was a constant visual thing for kids to watch.\n\n\"I think the belief that I will leave with the next generation is the biggest thing that will come from my career.\n\n\"I'm sure they will go on to bigger and better things than I have.\"\n\nTaylor told BBC Sport: \"Everyone coming after Dave is going to be a product of him, inspired by what he's done.\n\n\"Watching the way he works, his commitment, how professional he is, there are so many aspects I've taken from him through my career, he's had such an impact.\"\n\nSo what is next for Ryding? He is adamant he will stay in the sport in some capacity, keen to mentor young skiers.\n\nThat would afford him more time at home, something he \"owes\" to Mandy and their three-year-old daughter Nina.\n\n\"I have to learn that not everything is about my quads and how I'm feeling in the morning.\n\n\"It's going to be a transition. I'm going to have to learn about normal life. I'm ready for the change.\"\n\nReflecting on his career, he added: \"Everyone always says, 'What if you grew up in the mountains? What if you had all this training before you were 10?'.\n\n\"I don't look back and think 'what if?' I look back and think that was my story. That was my legacy and my path.\n\n\"I'm immensely proud of where I came from, a little village in Lancashire. Mum and dad sacrificed their lives for me.\n\n\"They gave me a chance and I just tried to maximise that chance.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "The FBI has matched a glove found two miles from the home of NBC host Savannah Guthrie’s mother to one worn by a masked individual suspected of kidnapping the 84-year-old more than two weeks ago.\n\nInvestigators told the Associated Press Sunday they’d found the item lying in a field near a road not far from Nancy Guthrie’s house in Tuscon, Arizona. DNA has been recovered from the glove, with official confirmation now pending on preliminary results that came through on Saturday.\n\n“It is never too late to do the right thing,” the Today show host said in a renewed appeal on Instagram. “And we are here. And we believe in the essential goodness of every human being, that it’s never too late.”\n\nGuthrie’s mother has not been seen since Jan. 31, when she was dropped at her residence in the Catalina Foothills by her son-in-law, Tommaso Cioni. The family reported her missing before noon the following day.\n\nInvestigators say they found blood on the porch of the property. Details released by local police indicate the doorbell camera was disconnected around 1.47 a.m. on Feb. 1, and that the 84-year-old’s pacemaker app registered a disconnect from her phone approximately half an hour later.\n\nSurveillance videos recovered from the scene further show an individual approaching the front door while wearing a ski mask and carrying a backpack. The FBI has confirmed that person as a suspect, describing him as roughly 5 feet 9 inches tall and of medium build.\n\nThe Pima County Sheriff’s Office told CBS Monday they believe the clothes and mask worn by the individual in the video were likely purchased from Walmart. Investigators have yet to identify the exact brands, having previously determined the person’s backpack was a black Ozark Trail Hiker.\n\nOnly Walmart sells that particular bag. The supermarket chain has reportedly now provided authorities with records of all sales of the item both online and in-store.\n\nThe sheriff’s office detained an individual for questioning following a traffic stop in Tucson last week. What had prompted the stop remains unclear, but the man was released a few hours later. Authorities carried out a search of a property about an hour south of the city later that afternoon.\n\nThe purported abductors have reportedly sent ransom notes to the media, issuing two deadlines for payment which have since passed. Guthrie’s family have raised additional concerns given the TV host’s mother requires daily medication to treat high blood pressure and ongoing heart issues.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the FBI for comment on this story.",

    "title": "The UK’s Epstein Crisis",
    "description": "Rachel...",
    "fullText": "If Keir Starmer is safe for now, it’s only for lack of alternatives within his party.\n\nIt took just 18 months for the Labour government to sink into the sand of its own morally adrift vacuity. Storming to power with an enviable majority in July 2024, after 14 years of fractious Conservative rule, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer promised stability, service over spectacle and a government of national renewal. Instead, we got the muddle of endless U-turns, persistent stagnation in the absence of joined-up, large-scale strategy and now, a full-blown crisis.\n\nStarmer’s personal ratings are already at rock bottom—the worst of any prime minister on record. But newly released Epstein files have prompted the resignation from the party of former US ambassador Peter Mandelson, as well as a police investigation, with Starmer’s top aides stepping down and mounting calls for the prime minister to go. If he is safe for now, it is only for lack of alternatives within his party. The prime minister has promised to change. But it’s hard to believe, much less feel sympathy for someone who brought this upon himself—not just the Epstein-related scandal but the dismal fortunes of the party in general. In any case, sympathies, now and always, should remain with the victims of Epstein’s heinous abuses, the countless women and girls for whom justice is constantly denied in the face of rotten political machinations.\n\nThe trigger for this government crisis, which has dominated the UK news cycle for the past week, is the US Department of Justice’s release of over 3 million documents from the Epstein files in late January. Some of those documents feature the now-disgraced Peter Mandelson, one of the key figures of the New Labour project during the Tony Blair years and well beyond. He had already been removed from his US ambassador role last September, when e-mails surfaced in which he appeared to defend or minimize the actions of his friend the convicted child sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. But the latest Epstein files were worse.\n\nThis time, there were bank statements showing payments totaling $75,000 from Epstein to Mandelson and his now-husband, Reinaldo Avila, although Mandelson says he has no record or recollection of receiving this sum. The new haul reveals that Epstein paid £10,000 ($13,500) for Avila’s osteopathy course. There are photos of Mandelson in his underpants talking to a woman in a bathrobe, reportedly at Epstein’s Paris apartment. And, astonishingly, documents appear to show that Mandelson, serving as Labour business secretary between 2008 and 2010, may have leaked market sensitive information to Epstein, relating to government plans in the aftermath of the financial crash. This is what triggered the opening of a police investigation, although Mandelson says he has not acted criminally. But, unsurprisingly, the stench proved too great for the government. Labour grandees and MPs alike lined up to express horror and shame and issue calls for accountability, while raising questions about their leadership’s judgment. Starmer himself apologized repeatedly and said he was “sorry for having believed Mandelson’s lies and appointed him.”\n\nBut you do have to wonder about the absence of such anguish in December 2024, when Mandelson was appointed US ambassador. Back then, the announcement was treated as a regular news item. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that Mandelson had “a wealth of experience in trade, economic and foreign policy from his years in government and the private sector.” One Labour MP enthused to The Guardian that Mandelson is “very good at making relationships, has unmatched negotiation skills.” Only left wingers raised alarm bells, with John McDonnell, former shadow chancellor, posting to X: “For many reasons associated with Peter Mandelson’s history in and out of political office, many will feel Keir has lost all sense of political judgement on this decision.”\n\nAmong those reasons must be that by then, Epstein’s “particularly close relationship” with Mandelson was already known, confirmed by documents released in a New York court in 2023. When asked about this friendship by the Financial Times in February 2025, Mandelson said: “It’s an FT obsession and frankly you can all fuck off, OK?” None of which seemed to concern those in the Labour party who kept Mandelson close. In fact, even in September 2025, when Mandelson was removed from post as US ambassador, Labour was insisting that he had until that point been considered “worth the risk” because of his “singular talents.”\n\nAnd that is where the rot lies. Because this appraisal reflects a mindset guided by factionalism and political favoritism, regardless of ethical considerations. Prior to this latest scandal, Mandelson had already resigned twice from cabinet positions during the New Labour years, over conflicts of interest and financial controversy. Add that to the Epstein friendship, and it seems glaringly obvious that he should not have been awarded an ambassadorial role. Yet it turns out he was also ushered into the heart of the Labour operation, influencing all sorts of decisions. As one former Labour official told The Guardian, in the run up to the 2024 election, Mandelson “didn’t have a desk but he would dip in and out on big issues; he was always there for advice.”\n\nUnfortunately, this culture of overlooking inconvenient truths within the tight, policies-light, Blairite faction running Labour is the Starmer leadership to the core. As one Labour insider told me of Mandelson, “He is the apex of it, but he is them. As long as they are in denial, they won’t be able to understand what is happening and why.”\n\nWith the majority of the British public unsure of what the Labour leader actually stands for, this hollow factionalism for the sake of it has long steered the Starmer project. It is why, during his party leadership bid, Starmer spouted left-wing pledges to win over the Labour membership and then ditched those promises in office. It is why his team were so determined to rout the left, freezing out advisers and parliamentarians, purging members and scorching election candidates for the most spurious of reasons, such as “liking” a tweet from a Green Party leader. It is why Starmer’s government has twisted in the wind, lacking a joined-up narrative or strategy, ideologically incapable of raising desperately needed revenue other than by trying to squeeze pensioners and disabled people. It is why the leadership has appeared so directionless, bouncing between multiple U-turns and endless freebies, amid negative briefings by his own advisers who quip that their boss is a useful idiot, fooled into thinking he is in charge. It is why the party has alienated its own voter base with its support for Israel during its decimation of Gaza, its harsh, migrant-bashing rhetoric and policies, and its refusal to boost public spending or break free from right-wing fiscal rules. Morgan McSweeney, the PM’s now-resigned right-hand man and a Mandelson protégé, made it his mission to rid the party of the Corbyn left. While left-wing Jeremy Corbyn was party leader in 2017, Peter Mandelson himself said, “I work every single day to bring forward the end of [Corbyn’s] tenure in office.” Well, it worked. But it also crashed the party.\n\nA deeply unpopular Labour prime minister is now fighting for his political life, with no real expectation that he will remain in office for long. When the veteran left MP Diane Abbot (suspended by Labour) told Channel 4 News she could not see Starmer lasting beyond the May local elections, she was asked, why wait until then to remove him? “Because they are going to be catastrophic elections,” she replied. “And I think the idea is to let him stay and take responsibility.” An additional factor is that no leadership contender, other than Blairite (and Mandelson mentee) Wes Streeting, is ready to mount a challenge.\n\nAll of which is manna from heaven to the hard-right, anti-immigration Reform Party which, under the leadership of Trump buddy Nigel Farage, is hoovering up both former Conservative parliamentarians and comfortably leading the polls. While Labour stormed to victory in 2024, its 172-seat majority was a vote against the corrupt Conservatives after 14 years of economic stagnation and a gutted welfare state. In fact, Labour won two-thirds of the nation’s seats on just one-third of the vote; put it all together and you can see why it was dubbed a “loveless landslide.” A struggling population gasping for financial relief now views Britain’s two main parties, the Conservatives and Labour, as part of the same self-interested political establishment—and are looking elsewhere. That explains the rise of Reform, but also the revived fortunes of the Green Party under the bold eco-populist leader Zack Polanski. Green strategists note that in the run-up to the forthcoming by-election in Gorton and Denton, a Labour stronghold in Greater Manchester, voters seemed to be deciding between the Greens and Reform. Looking at doorstep data taken before the Mandelson scandal, one Green party aide told me, “It’s clear that people just want an alternative,” before adding. “Labour is not coming up at all. People are not talking about them.”",

    "description": "Can any other European league rival the drama of Scotland? BBC Sport has picked out the five closest title battles.",
    "fullText": "Sunday was a dramatic day in the three-way battle for the Scottish Premiership title.\n\nFirst up, Celtic came from two goals down to snatch a 3-2 victory at Kilmarnock - with Julian Araujo scoring the winner in the seventh minute of stoppage time.\n\nThen there was a six-pointer between Rangers and Hearts at Ibrox. Twice the away side took the lead, only for a Youssef Chermiti hat-trick to transform the game and give Danny Rohl's side a 4-2 win.\n\nIt left the three teams separated by just three points: Hearts on 57, Rangers on 55 and Celtic on 54.\n\nCeltic have a game in hand, away at Aberdeen on 4 March, which could leave the trio within two points of each other.\n\nThere are several close two-team title races across Europe.\n\nIn France, there is just one point between Lens and Paris St-Germain.\n\nAnd in Spain, Real Madrid are two points behind Barcelona with a game in hand.\n\nBut in both those leagues there is a sizeable gap to third place.\n\nCan any other European league rival the drama of Scotland? BBC Sport has picked out the five closest title battles.\n\nThe Austrian Bundesliga seems to be the league in which any one team can beat any other. Indeed, there is an argument that this is the best title race in Europe.\n\nWith 19 games played, just two points separate the top four. Of those, only Austria Vienna managed to win at the weekend with league leaders Red Bull Salzburg drawing at second-bottom Grazer AK.\n\nIn the 12-team league, a mere six points covers the top six, with nine points across the top 10. Only the bottom two clubs are truly disconnected from the rest.\n\nA little bit like Scotland does in April, the Austrian top six and the bottom six split away from each other in three weeks.\n\nThe points will be halved and rounded down, which will create an even closer title race.\n\nIt extremely close in the Superleague of Kosovo, with three teams a point apart.\n\nBallkani missed the chance to go clear at the top on Monday when they lost at home Malisheva.\n\nIt was a result which made the title race all the more fascinating with the top three so close together, and Malisheva just in behind.\n\nThe picture in the Greek Super League is identical to Scotland after PAOK and AEK Athens played out a 0-0 draw on Sunday.\n\nAEK are top on 49 points, with Olympiakos two points behind after they could also only manage a goalless draw at Levadiakos.\n\nPAOK are on 46 points but have a game in hand, away to Kifisia on 4 March. Win that and there is two points between three teams.\n\nSimilar to Scotland, the top four break away after 22 March and will play each other twice to decide the title.\n\nAEK Athens - 49 points (21 games)\n\nIt is another unusual season in the Belgian Pro League, with the potential that Sint-Truiden could win the first title in their history.\n\nIf they pull it off, it would follow on from Union Saint-Gilloise being crowned champions for the first time in 90 years last season.\n\nUnion only drew at the weekend to leave them two points ahead of Sint-Truiden, who needed a late winner to complete a 3-2 comeback victory at home to Zulte Waregem.\n\nBut three points behind and waiting to pounce are 19-time champions Club Brugge.\n\nThe top six in Belgium will split off on their own after 22 March.\n\nUnion Saint-Gilloise - 53 points\n\nThe top of the table in the Poland's Ekstraklasa is very tight, though league leaders Jagiellonia Bialystok have a game in hand.\n\nIf Jagiellonia, who drew 0-0 at the weekend, win that fixture the picture is significantly different as they would go six points clear.\n\nWisla Plock failed to close the gap by losing at home to relegation-threatened Widzew Lodz on Saturday.\n\nBut for now six points separate the top eight, with third-placed Gornik Zabrze playing their game in hand on Monday evening.\n\nJagiellonia Bialystok - 36 points (20 games)\n\nWhat thrilling week tells us about Premiership title race\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Mikel Arteta gave a glimpse of what could be the next evolution of the Arsenal attack... Bukayo Saka playing as a number 10.",
    "fullText": "A player dropping out of the warm-up before a game is something Mikel Arteta has had to get used to this season.\n\nWhen Riccardo Calafiori pulled out before Arsenal's game with Wigan on Sunday, it was the third time in this campaign that this had happened to the Gunners before a match.\n\nBut on this occasion, Arteta gave a glimpse of what could be the next evolution of the Arsenal attack - Bukayo Saka playing as a number 10.\n\nWhen Calafiori and Saka had to pull out of games against Brighton and Leeds earlier this season, Arteta made straight swaps for players in their positions but for this match he shuffled his players around.\n\nMyles Lewis-Skelly, who was pencilled in to start in midfield, was moved to left-back and Saka, who is building up his fitness after a hip issue, was brought into the number 10 role.\n\nIn part, Arteta's decision to play Saka there is down to the midfield injury issues that the Gunners are currently facing.\n\nCaptain Martin Odegaard, Kai Havertz and Mikel Merino, the other go-to midfield options in the squad, are all injured and Ethan Nwaneri is on loan at Marseille.\n\nFour-goal burst helps Arsenal power past Wigan\n\nFA Cup winners' medal, Odegaard's armband and Pictionary with Arteta\n\nIs Zubimendi Arsenal's best player?\n\nBut this was not the first time that Saka has played in a central role under Arteta.\n\nDuring the lockdown season of 2020, Saka played in midfield against Brighton in a 2-1 loss, hitting the crossbar from the edge of the box with a right-footed shot and providing an assist for Nicolas Pepe.\n\nSaka is one of the best wingers in the world, even if his numbers are down from what you would likely expect from him so far this season.\n\nThe 24-year-old has seven goals and seven assists in 33 games in all competitions this season.\n\nOne thing that makes Saka so threatening is that he can control the ball in tight spaces even when closely marked and he showed that when challenged by the Wigan midfield during the game.\n\nHe dropped deep to pick the ball up while he also swapped positions with Noni Madueke, who was playing in Saka's usual right-wing position, and the Gunners' third goal came from Saka's cross after good work between the pair on the right.\n\nSaka playing in that position could also mean the pathway for 16-year-old Max Dowman is clearer and means Arteta could play the talented youngster and Saka in the same side.\n\nMadueke is also in excellent form and has three goals and an assist in his last five games and with Wolves on Wednesday and midfield injuries, there's a chance we could see Saka continue in his role, with Arteta hinting the England international could feature there more this season.\n\n\"That's something that's a possibility and I wanted to try it, and we might use it in the future,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"There are still so many games, competitions and different scenarios to play in this season, and that's a possibility that we have.\"\n\nUmir Irfan, Football Tactics Correspondent:\n\nFrom a wing position, a player is essentially playing at 180 degress – with half of the pitch cut off by the touchline. Centrally, Saka can play at 360 degrees – with the ability to dribble or pass in any direction.\n\nArteta highlighted the benefit of him here succinctly, saying of Saka's ability to be more unpredictable in both his decision-making and his positioning, \"it's more difficult for the opponent to get his reference constantly\".\n\nAs the number 10, Saka showcased his positional versatility on the day, floating to the left side of attacking midfield, as well as rotating well with Madueke on the right wing.\n\nKey to Arsenal's build-up has been players rotating frequently while maintaining their shape, with opponents pressing them finding it hard to know who to follow. Saka's inclusion as a number 10 brings this added fluidity to Arsenal's attack, which helped them pull apart Wigan for the duration of his cameo.\n\n\"He can interchange positions with a wide player, he's so good at picking those spaces,\" said Arteta of these movements.\n\nThe added benefit of arriving into these positions, whether wide or central, rather than waiting on the touchline for the ball, helped him get on the ball with separation from his marker more often too. This was how he helped force Jack Hunt's own goal on the day too.\n\nAs one of the more senior players of the team, Saka possesses both the mental and physical qualities to absorb the pressure of playing centrally. Saka's ability to take contact from defenders that clatter into the back of him is something he has mastered in the safer environment of the right wing and is invaluable centrally.\n\nTactically, however, attacking through the middle poses a greater risk, given how many bodies are positioned here. Losing the ball centrally leads to opponents having better positions to counter-attack from too. Arteta's Arsenal have therefore generally opted to go around opponents rather than through.\n\nHaving a player with the quality to not turn the ball over in these dangerous areas but instead take the ball reliably on their backfoot before driving at defenders and linking with team-mates in the small spaces, provides the Gunners with an added dimension to their attack.\n\nAs good as Saka is for the team, his numbers slightly underwhelm, so getting him closer to goal would allow him to score or assist more himself.\n\nHis catalogue of curling shots from the right side of midfield is enough proof of his ability to change a game - but moving to the left side of attacking midfield, Saka showed a potent and more powerful type of strike across goal too.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at a feature of Serie A coverage which is delighting fans once more, three decades after the height of its popularity.",
    "fullText": "Competition between sports broadcasters is serious business.\n\nPurchasing the rights to show tournaments and leagues on television can be very expensive, and with (hopefully) plenty of viewers watching at home, quality of coverage must be top-notch to avoid being pilloried by fans and outdone by rivals.\n\nBut that does not mean broadcasters cannot admire - and even celebrate - the work of their peers.\n\nFootball fans were pleasantly surprised to see that BBC Alba's brand new coverage of Italy's Serie A - appearing on free-to-air TV in the UK for the first time since 2008 - brought back the theme tune and graphics from Gazzetta Football Italia, the hugely popular Italian football show broadcast by Channel 4 between 1992 and 2002.\n\nSo, how exactly did the retro throwback come about, and what is the thinking behind it?\n\nWatch the Serie A intro sequence on BBC iPlayer\n\nWhen BBC Alba struck the deal for its Serie A rights - eight games featuring Scottish players before the nation's return to the World Cup this summer - staff in Scotland worked with colleagues at production company Sunset+Vine to build a plan for the best coverage possible.\n\nThey decided that bringing back the iconic intro, complete with the cry of 'Golazo' at the end of the theme tune, was the best approach.\n\nWhen the title sequence played before kick-off between Bologna and Torino on Sunday evening, it was met with a hugely popular reception online.\n\n\"It was a no-brainer to bring back the branding - we would have done people a disservice if we hadn't thought about it,\" said Margaret Cameron, director of content at Alba.\n\n\"It was a very deliberate choice to put out a well-timed nostalgia bomb.\"\n\nThe next fixture chosen for broadcast is Atalanta v Napoli (14:00 GMT) on Sunday, 22 February - viewers can watch on BBC Alba in Scotland and BBC iPlayer across the UK.\n\nNeil Paterson, commercial, rights and business affairs manager at the BBC, said: \"I'm 42, so I loved the Channel 4 show and wanted it to be a nod to that.\n\n\"The BBC has blanket music agreements with a company called BMG, and the theme song was included in that, so it was pretty straightforward.\n\n\"I get on well with Channel 4's head of sport, so it was a case of calling them as a courtesy to let them know what we were planning. They were really pleased and excited about it.\"\n\nSeven Scottish players, including Napoli's Ballon d'Or nominee Scott McTominay, are playing in Serie A this season.\n\n\"We became aware towards the end of last season that DAZN, which owns the UK rights for Serie A, were willing to sublet some international rights,\" said Cameron.\n\n\"We have been thinking about this since then because we want to capitalise on what is a really big moment in Scottish sporting history - going back to the World Cup with some great players who are playing in one of Europe's best leagues.\"\n\nWhile some broadcasters buy TV rights in order to sell subscriptions to sports packages and advertising slots, the BBC does so in order to offer licence-fee payers the best value for money.\n\nBBC Alba is a partnership between the BBC and MG Alba, meaning the channel's output is funded by both the licence fee and the Scottish government. It broadcasts content in Gaelic, with co-commentary on Serie A matches featuring both Gaelic and English.\n\n\"Sport is really important to us. It's a good way to tap in to audiences in Scotland that are underserved and offer them something which is normally behind a paywall,\" said Cameron.\n\n\"Our opportunities to draw big attention online can be quite limited, so we have to be aware of picking the eight games as smartly as possible. The first match performed well.\"\n\nThe theme song is a remix of 1992 dance anthem I'm Stronger Now by Definitive Two with added football lingo and commentary.\n\nSocial media posts about the title sequence generated thousands of interactions online.\n\n\"It's been really nice to see the big, positive reaction\", said Grant Philips, executive producer at Sunset+Vine, which works with BBC Alba on projects across many sports.\n\n\"It evokes all those memories so many people have from back then.\"\n\n\"Yesterday's match was up against the Winter Olympics, Rangers playing Hearts, Celtic away at Kilmarnock, and the FA Cup in England, so seeing it get the attention it has is great and will hopefully mean more people know about it.\"\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, Serie A was the world's leading football league. Its clubs spent the most money, boasted the best players and attracted the attention of fans around the globe.\n\nWhile the likes of Roberto Baggio, Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane were powering their teams to glory and winning the Ballon d'Or, UK football fans were dazzled by them on Gazzetta Football Italia.\n\nThe programme featured live coverage of matches presented by broadcaster James Richardson, whose intellectual and elegant approach was a hit.\n\n\"I still meet people who used to watch it, and they have such nice things to say about it - how much they enjoyed watching,\" Richardson told World Football Index last year.\n\n\"They used to look forward to watching it, and I'm really touched when they tell me that. I feel really lucky to be involved in something like that. If people remember me as a nice guy that they enjoyed hearing from, then that would be terrific.\"",

    "title": "Ratcliffe, Man Utd and the immigration comments fallout",
    "description": "Sports editor Dan Roan analyses the potential fallout of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments on immigration.",
    "fullText": "In the coming days, Sir Jim Ratcliffe should discover if the Football Association's legal team has decided the Manchester United co-owner brought the game into disrepute with his comments on immigration last week, which sparked condemnation from the government and beyond.\n\nThe governing body could decide his remarks reached the threshold required for him to be charged with a breach of its rules, it could write to the billionaire to remind him of his responsibilities, or it could choose to take no action at all.\n\nBut whatever the FA does, the impact of his claim that the UK had been \"colonised by immigrants\" - while citing incorrect population data - could be felt for some time to come.\n\nRegardless of the fact Ratcliffe also received support in some quarters for raising the issue of immigration in his interview with Sky News, the fact United felt the need to issue a statement, external that read like a public rebuke towards their own co-owner was a sign of the dismay felt at Old Trafford - along with concern at the potential cost of the backlash his words provoked.\n\nThe pointed assertion of United's \"inclusive and welcoming\" values - while not directly naming Ratcliffe - was a deliberate attempt to distance the club from him, and according to Old Trafford sources was signed off at the highest level.\n\nHours earlier Ratcliffe had said, external he was \"sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth\".\n\nWho is billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe and how did he make his money?\n\nRatcliffe sorry language 'offended some' after immigration comments\n\nRatcliffe has always spoken highly of the Glazer family, describing them as \"the nicest people on the planet\" last year.\n\nBut according to a source familiar with them, the club's majority shareholders will have been \"horrified\" by his initial remarks, and will have seen them as showing \"disregard for their ownership\".\n\nThe Glazers - whose grandparents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to the US - are yet to comment on the episode.\n\nBut the source believes a key reason they have supported inclusive initiatives such as All Red All Equal at the club is because they see it as a brand to be nurtured and heavily commercialised, and they will have taken a dim view of remarks that could make sponsors reconsider partnering with United.\n\n\"Big multi-nationals want to associate with youth, positivity and forward-thinking. United is currently struggling for sponsors… and this exacerbates that,\" the source added, suggesting that some potential partners would \"run a mile\".\n\nThis all came just days after the Glazers were said to have voiced their concerns about United's commercial performance, external at a recent meeting.\n\nIt is easy to see why. United have been without a training kit partner since last season, and their shirt-sleeve sponsor is also set to expire in the summer.\n\nLast year Marriott International - the world's largest hotel company - decided not to extend its sponsorship agreement, external with United after its contract expired.\n\nThe club's deal with Adidas is also worth £10m less this year because United have failed to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons.\n\nWhile United still managed to post record commercial revenue of £333m last year, their main Premier League rivals have been catching them up in recent years.\n\nSo, even with the club's statement and Ratcliffe's qualified apology, it is easy to see why there may be some nervousness among club executives in the wake of the controversy.\n\nPerhaps even more will now hinge on whether the team can secure Champions League qualification for next season.\n\nWhat this means for the long-term relationship between the six Glazer siblings - who retain 70% of the club - and their British business partner is unclear.\n\nIt is worth noting that under the terms of the agreement that saw Ratcliffe invest £1.25bn in the club in 2024, if the Glazers receive an offer from a third party that they want to accept, they can force him to sell his portion.\n\nAnd then there is the club's hopes for a new 100,000-seat stadium as part of a 370-acre Trafford regeneration project that relies on the support of local and national politicians.\n\nIn January, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Trafford council leader Tom Ross both hailed a new development corporation designed to enable the delivery of the multi-billion pound plan.\n\nThree weeks later however, both men issued statements condemning Ratcliffe's comments. The same applied to both Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves, both of whom had previously expressed support for the redevelopment project.\n\nWhile local officials have vowed that taxpayer money will not be used for the new stadium itself, public funds are being sought for surrounding infrastructure, including the crucial relocation of a neighbouring freight rail terminal to St Helens. Burnham has also said that his office could use compulsory purchase powers via the development corporation to force the sale of land required for the new stadium.\n\nIt is unclear whether Ratcliffe's remarks may make the ongoing negotiations more challenging, but they came at an important moment.\n\n\"Real harm could been done,\" one source close to the regeneration project said.\n\n\"The dust is still settling and none of it is insurmountable. But the optics of the council, the mayor and the government appearing to support his plans just became harder.\"\n\nUnited's hope will be that those involved focus on the 15,000 new homes, 48,000 new local jobs and billions of pounds in value to the economy that the project is said to be worth.\n\nIt appears Ratcliffe's relationship with many of United's fans has been harmed too.\n\n\"Comments from the club's senior leadership should make inclusion easier, not harder\", posted the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST).\n\nGhulam Haydar of the Manchester United Muslim Supporters' Club (MUMSC) told BBC Sport that Ratcliffe's apology was \"a first step\", but said he would like the 73-year-old to agree to a meeting with their members in order to provide some assurances.\n\n\"This is a global club… what's he going to do to actually assure us that the club is a welcoming space for people of colour, people of migrant backgrounds?\" he asked.\n\nMUMSC has said it does not feel that Ratcliffe's apology \"sufficiently addresses the seriousness\" of what was said.\n\n\"Expressing regret for causing offence is not the same as acknowledging the wider impact of words used. Leadership requires accountability as well as openness to debate.\"\n\nKick It Out - which works to fight racism, sexism and homophobia in football and says overall reports about discrimination have risen again this campaign after last season's record high, external - told BBC Sport that it has already received a number of reports about Ratcliffe's comments.\n\nHaving cut jobs and raised ticket prices, Ratcliffe was the subject of a protest by a supporter group just two weeks ago over the way the Ineos hierarchy has run the club since taking over football operations.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what kind of reception Ratcliffe receives when he next visits Old Trafford.\n\nUncertainty also surrounds the impact this could have on manager Michael Carrick - who will face questions about this issue for the first time when he addresses the media this week - along with United's players and staff, described by the club in their statement as a \"diverse group [that] reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home.\"\n\nDespite United's recent upturn in form since the appointment of the former midfielder, these are challenging times for Ratcliffe and his business Ineos, the petrochemicals firm he founded and leads.\n\nLast week, he warned, external that \"current conditions for Europe's chemical industry are unsurvivable without immediate intervention\".\n\nThose concerns were the reason Ratcliffe was at an industry summit in Antwerp. And they were clearly what he intended to talk about in an interview that instead ended up with him engulfed in a fierce political storm.\n\nIt is a controversy that is unlikely to blow over quickly, and the true repercussions are yet to become clear.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Ringmaster Tyson Fury was back to his old tricks, declaring he is \"coming back to make boxing great again\" and promising to bring his own brand of \"circus\" to the sport.\n\nThe 37-year-old British heavyweight will face Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 11 April.\n\nFury revelled in the spotlight at Monday's news conference, delivering his trademark long and winding answers as he came face-to-face with Makhmudov at the north London venue.\n\n\"I came back for one reason only and that's to make boxing great again,\" Fury said.\n\n\"Since I retired for the fifth time over a year ago, boxing has gone on a downward slope.\n\n\"It's become quite boring and boxing is at its maximum potential when Tyson Fury is actively fighting - and I didn't say that, the cleverest AI on earth said that, ChatGPT.\"\n\nThe Morecambe fighter retired in January 2025, shortly after his second defeat by Oleksandr Usyk, but announced his comeback last month.\n\nFury said the \"biggest turning point\" was the car crash involving British rival Anthony Joshua, which killed two of Joshua's friends.\n\n\"I thought life is very, very short and precious and fragile and anything can happen at any given moment,\" Fury said.\n\n\"You should never put things off until tomorrow or next year or next week because tomorrow is never promised to nobody.\"\n\nAn air-raid siren accompanied 36-year-old Makhmudov's arrival before a suited-up Fury strolled to the stage, smiling broadly.\n\n\"He's back,\" announced Fury, who flew in overnight from a training camp in Thailand.\n\n\"I feel fresh. I feel good,\" he said. \"If I was on the decline I would say it. I'd be the first to say.\"\n\nFury has not fought in Britain since December 2022, when he stopped Derek Chisora at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to retain the WBC title.\n\nHe boasts 34 wins from 37 fights, including 24 knockouts, alongside two defeats by Usyk and a draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\n\"I bring a circus. I bring an entourage. I bring entertainment. I bring action. I bring cameras,\" Fury added, insisting he was still in his \"prime\".\n\nAsked for a prediction, the Gypsy King forecast a sixth-round knockout with his \"right hand\".\n\nMakhmudov, meanwhile, kept it respectful and would not be drawn into insults or predictions.\n\nHe has won 21 of his 23 professional contests, with 19 victories by knockout. His most recent outing was a win over Briton Dave Allen in October 2025.\n\nNicknamed The Lion, Makhmudov recalled meeting Fury in Canada about a decade ago and described him as a \"legend\", but said he is now focused on building his own \"legacy\".\n\nThe face-off was good-natured. \"You're a big boy, aren't you?\" Fury said with a grin, and the pair closed it out with a handshake.\n\nIt was vintage Fury - long answers and drifting metaphors. At one point he compared himself to a honeybee.\n\nThere is a genuine question over whether he can fill Tottenham Hotspur Stadium without a marquee dance partner; Makhmudov is not a crossover name.\n\nBut it will be Fury's first fight broadcast on Netflix, which has a global subscriber base of more than 325 million. With the second series of At Home With The Furys landing this spring, the platform offers a ready-made audience.\n\nOne subplot is the corner. Fury has recently worked with SugarHill Steward but -speaking on the TV broadcast - claimed he will not be trained by anyone for this bout. Whether that materialises or is simply more theatre remains to be seen.\n\nBeyond April, the focus quickly shifts to what comes next. Fury wants to become a three-time world champion. WBO champion Fabio Wardley faces Daniel Dubois on 9 May, and the winner could offer a direct route back to the top.\n\nA trilogy with Oleksandr Usyk remains Fury's preferred option, while a long-discussed fight with Joshua lingers in the background.\n\nAll that comes later. Fury's future hinges on 11 April.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Pallekele\n\nAustralia 181 all out (20 overs): Head 56 (29); Hemantha 3-37\n\nSri Lanka 184-2 (18 overs): Nissanka 100* (52), Kusal Mendis 51 (38)\n\nAustralia's hopes of reaching the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup are all but over after Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka hit a brilliant unbeaten 100 to condemn them to an eight-wicket defeat in Pallekele.\n\nStunned by Zimbabwe in their second outing on Friday, Australia needed a win to keep their qualification fate in their own hands but it is Sri Lanka who march into the next round.\n\nFor Australia to sneak through as the second-placed team from their group, they now need Zimbabwe to lose both of their remaining matches against Ireland and Sri Lanka and then to defeat Oman themselves which would bring net run-rate into play.\n\nAustralia's predicament came from their inability to convert a good start from their openers Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh as they set the home side a target of 182 after a collapse in the second half of their innings.\n\nDespite the feeling Sri Lanka could have a complicated chase on their hands because of a pitch which was slowing down, they eased to victory with the Australian bowling attack lacking any bite in the absence of injured Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc.\n\nAnd the Sri Lanka duo of Nissanka and Kusal Mendis took full advantage.\n\nWith wicketkeeper Mendis providing perfect support with a composed 51 from 38 balls, Nissanka brought up his century in 52 balls to take his side past the finish line with an innings that blended brute power and finesse.\n\nAustralia had Marsh return after recovering from a groin injury that forced him out of the first two matches and the returning skipper gave his side a solid platform batting alongside Head, who hit a long-overdue half-century off 27 balls.\n\nThey powered Australia to 104-0 in 8.2 overs before Head departed for 59 and it marked the beginning of dramatic downturn.\n\nMarsh followed him shortly after with a brisk 54 as they unravelled alarmingly to be bundled out for 181, losing their final five wickets in the space of just seven runs and 14 balls.\n\nWith Sri Lanka chasing down the target with ease, the Australians are left clinging to only the slimmest mathematical hope and will watch nervously as Zimbabwe face Ireland on Tuesday.\n\nIt looked as though Sri Lanka's chase of 182 might slip away early when Kusal Perera fell to Marcus Stoinis only eight balls in.\n\nBut it became clear almost immediately Nissanka was operating on an entirely different level in Pallekele, playing \"an innings for the ages,\" as Test Match Special commentator Daniel Norcross labelled it.\n\nNissanka raced to 38 off 20 balls to lift Sri Lanka to 61‑1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nKusal Mendis then picked up the pace against Australia's spinners, bringing up his third consecutive half-century of this T20 World Cup in 35 balls before Nissanka joined him, reaching his fifty in just 32 deliveries.\n\nAustralia would have hoped for a way back after Mendis departed in the 13th over with Sri Lanka on 105‑2, and though Pavan Rathnayake walked in, he only needed to play second fiddle to Nissanka, who effortlessly took Sri Lanka past the target.\n\nThe 27‑year‑old Sri Lanka opener was outstanding in manipulating the leg‑side field all game, scoring 26 runs through mid‑wicket and another 20 through square leg.\n\nBut he mixed brutal hitting with plenty of finesse too, guiding 15 runs down to third with some deft late cuts.\n\nAdding extra sweetness to Nissanka's day was an extraordinary catch he took to dismiss Glenn Maxwell and keep Australia at bay in the closing stages of their innings.\n\nHaving dropped Maxwell in the previous over, Nissanka more than made up for it with a brilliant flying catch at backward point to send back the Australia all-rounder, who had looked dangerous.\n\nThough there will be concern for pacer Matheesha Pathirana, who walked off with an injury, Sri Lanka will fancy their chances of putting on a good show in the Super 8s and making it to the semi-finals, with both Nissanka and Mendis in good form.\n\nAustralia captain Mitchell Marsh: \"I thought it was a competitive total at the halfway mark but with the start we had, maybe a few short. Well played to Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We know that at our best we can make big scores but we lost our way a little bit at the end and Sri Lanka bowled well. Not much more to say other than Sri Lanka outplayed us.\n\n\"It's a devastated group. We are in the lap of gods now. We haven't been at our best. We will watch the Zimbabwe vs Ireland game and hope.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka: \"One of the best performances in the recent times. Really happy with how the proceedings went.\n\n\"We were still very positive after losing [Pathirana] in the powerplay. We had the confidence and knew about the wicket. Each and every one showed a good body language today. And everyone wanted to contribute somehow.\n\n\"We hope to continue like this in the tournament. It's wonderful to qualify after many years. It's a good team. We should go to the next round and hopefully make to the semis. Thanks to the massive crowd today.\"\n\nNissanka's century leads Sri Lanka to victory and puts Australia on brink - as it happened\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers",

We don't want it to be that close and feel those nerves.\n\n\"But, going forward, it's more experience and we can never have enough of that.\"\n\nEngland progress at World Cup despite Italy scare\n\n'England have no chance at T20 World Cup if they do not improve'\n\nJofra Archer took two wickets in the first over of Italy's chase but Ben Menenti smashed 60 from 25 balls and Grant Stewart 45 from 22 to give Italy real hope.\n\nWith Stewart at the crease, the tournament's lowest-ranked side needed 30 runs from the final two overs for an almighty upset.\n\nThat England came through is obviously a positive. Sam Curran, who also defended 10 from the last over against Nepal, dismissed Stewart in the penultimate over.\n\nHe admitted there have been nerves throughout the initial group stage.\n\n\"It's actually just a tricky stage in a World Cup,\" Curran told the BBC.\n\n\"You're nervous, you've got all kinds of nerves and expectation.\n\n\"I had a little chat with Morgs [former England captain Eoin Morgan] before the toss and said these are the hardest games because we want to get there so badly.\n\n\"Now we've done it it's [about] enjoying it.

    "fullText": "Inter Milan President Beppe Marotta has offered his verdict on Saturday’s Derby d’Italia incident involving Alessandro Bastoni.\n\nSpeaking ahead of today’s Lega Serie A assembly via FCInterNews, the Nerazzurri chief urged the media to ease the pressure on the 26-year-old.\n\nAlessandro Bastoni has become one of the most unpopular figures in the country following his antics during the weekend’s clash at San Siro.\n\nIndeed, he misled referee Federico La Penna to show Juventus defender Pierre Kalulu a second yellow card in the first half.\n\nDespite being on a yellow card himself, Bastoni took the risk, and it paid off, as his simulation led to the Frenchman’s expulsion.\n\nMeanwhile, Inter took three points, courtesy of Piotr Zielinski’s late heroics, as Cristian Chivu finally broke his ‘big game’ curse in Serie A.\n\nHowever, Bastoni had to pay a hefty price for his actions, facing widespread criticism and even receiving death threats on social media,\n\nNow, Beppe Marotta stepped into the Italian center-back’s defense.\n\nVERONA, ITALY – NOVEMBER 02: Alessandro Bastoni of FC Internazionale celebrates during the Serie A match between Hellas Verona FC and FC Internazionale at Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi on November 02, 2025 in Verona, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\n“Our position is very simple,” Marotta stated. “I am here because we noticed an excessive media reaction compared to what actually happened.\n\n“Alessandro Bastoni has been subjected to a media witch-hunt that goes far beyond the incident itself.\n\n“We are talking about a 26-year-old player who has played over 300 Serie A matches and has never been involved in any sensational incidents.\n\n“He is an asset for our national team. Some even question his presence in future call-ups, but that is not fair; it is absolutely unjust.\n\n“We are facing a mistake by a young player, but who hasn’t made mistakes?\n\n“When we talk about simulation, we are referring to an act that has existed since the 1950s, when there were already famous players known for this gesture.\n\n“This is, I would say, an ordinary occurrence, not extraordinary; certainly deplorable because the reaction has been exaggerated.\n\n“However, it is due to contributing factors, given Kalulu’s arm and the referee’s immediate whistle.\n\n“All of this led to a reaction and a wrong decision, which I acknowledge.\n\n“But this is the referee class we had last year; the same designator ran it.\n\n“Last year, we lost the Scudetto by one point. In hindsight, in Inter-Roma, they recognized a clear penalty in our favor that could have determined the outcome of the championship.\n\n“This year, as a club, we intervened only in the case of Napoli-Inter over a penalty that changed the course of the match.\n\n“The competent authorities later reviewed that penalty and declared incorrect.”\n\nPARMA, ITALY – APRIL 05: Giuseppe Marotta of FC Internazionale during the Serie A match between Parma and FC Internazionale at Stadio Ennio Tardini on April 05, 2025 in Parma, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\n“We are facing a general malaise, and that’s fine,” he added. “But everyone must take responsibility – the CAN and AIA, the clubs through their executives, players and coaches, the institutional bodies, and the FIGC.\n\n“I am not referring to you journalists, because you draw conclusions from what you see and from the statements of those involved.\n\n“You are doing your job correctly, and I am not here to teach you what to do.\n\n“But what happens in Italy also happens abroad.\n\n“It is time to have a broad discussion without creating controversy.\n\n“Perhaps this is the moment to toughen disciplinary and financial penalties for executives, players, and coaches.\n\n“Often, misconduct goes beyond acceptable limits, even at the refereeing level, as has happened in recent months.\n\n“Bastoni did not behave in line with the principles of fair play, fine. But everyone must understand this.\n\n“Repression is not part of my approach; certainly, prevention is possible, but prevention comes through dialogue, which is currently missing.\n\n“The AIC [players’ association] must also get involved.\n\n“Sometimes I notice a certain ignorance regarding regulatory aspects that all players should know.”\n\nUDINE, ITALY – APRIL 08: Giuseppe Marotta, CEO of Sport for FC Internazionale looks on prior to the Serie A TIM match between Udinese Calcio and FC Internazionale at Dacia Arena on April 08, 2024 in Udine, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\n“There is disappointment,” Marotta said. “I don’t know who Roberto Saviano is, I don’t know what role he has.\n\n“I don’t want to give him any importance. He made statements that our lawyers will consider.”\n\nThen, he commented on Giorgio Chiellini’s overreaction during the derby.\n\n“I think that’s the minimum. He was my player; he is a young and inexperienced executive.\n\n“I don’t allow myself to give him advice. What happened involves locker room dynamics that are not for me to evaluate, judge, or analyze.”\n\nFinally, Marotta reminded everyone that these things already happened in the past and were in Inter’s favor.\n\n“I have already answered this question,” he said. “In recent years, Inter has been the most successful team, winning the most trophies and accumulating the most points in the league.\n\n“Regarding simulations, I would like to mention a small incident from Juventus-Inter 2021.\n\n“At 2-2, in the 88th minute, Juventus got a penalty for a clear simulation by Juan Cuadrado, a player for whom I have great affection.\n\n“Calvarese was the referee; subsequently, the referee and the technical bodies confirmed it was a clear simulation.\n\n“That simulation led to Juventus’ victory and their qualification for the Champions League, which brought them 60–70 million euros.”",

    "fullText": "Bukayo Saka was initially named on the bench for Arsenal’s FA Cup fourth round tie against Wigan Athletic on Sunday, but when the teams emerged from the tunnel he was part of the starting lineup.\n\nArsenal announced that Riccardo Calafiori had dropped out of the team, with Mikel Arteta confirming afterwards that the player is an injury doubt.\n\nBut it was still somewhat surprising to see Saka coming in. Arsenal had defensive and midfield options on the bench, so someone else could have come in at left-back, or if Myles Lewis-Skelly moved to the left then a natural midfielder could have replaced him centrally.\n\nInstead, Saka played in the middle, and he put in an impressive display that had some fans asking if he might play there again in the future.\n\n“That’s something that’s a possibility,” Arteta said afterwards. “I wanted to try it, and we might use it in the future. There are still so many games, competitions and different scenarios to play in this season, and that’s a possibility that we have.\n\n“He’s more central, he’s closer to the goal. It’s a bit more difficult for the opponent to get his reference constantly.\n\n“He can interchange positions with a wide player as well, and he’s so good at picking those spaces. When he’s there, he can really hurt you with the ball.”\n\nIt’s an exciting possibility, particularly with Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz struggling so badly with injuries this season. Arsenal generally lack creativity in central areas when those two are out, but Saka can provide a good option in those circumstances.\n\nWith Saka coming off at half-time at 4-0, there’s every possibility he’ll be back in the starting lineup against Wolves on Wednesday. Which position he takes up will be very interesting to see.",

    "description": "And these positions to the list…",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals have some obvious needs. That’s a given. We all know that they need to add pass rushers and a safety.\n\nLet’s talk about two sneaky needs that we aren’t talking about enough.\n\nD.J. Turner has arrived. 2025 was his breakout season and established him as this team’s CB1 at long last. Dax Hill has been pushed every which way. From safety to the outside to the inside and finally back to the outside. He has found his place and is a high-quality starter opposite Turner.\n\nThat all sounds great, right? Well, it is for now, but both Turner and Hill are entering the final year of their contracts.\n\nI would love to keep them both, but without clarity on how that is going to go, cornerback is a sneaky need.\n\nWhile we are talking about outside cornerback, it might make sense to add someone with the versatility to play inside and out. This way, he could contribute this season and into the future if Turner and Hill are both back in 2027.\n\nVersatility equals flexibility.\n\nThere is nothing sneaky about the need to replace Geno Stone. It smacks you in the face every time you turn on the film.\n\nSo let’s talk about the other safety. Battle looked pretty solid last year, at least comparatively, but he was in the same draft class as Turner, and you know what that means. He is entering the last year of his contract.\n\nThe Bengals had no depth at safety a year ago. If they did, they would have at least tried someone else in Stone’s place. Now Tycen Anderson hits free agency (potentially). They need to replace Stone, but they also need to add a depth piece with the potential to replace Battle in a year.",

    "fullText": "In the NBA, star power isn’t just a luxury — it’s a signal of stability, identity and sustained excellence. One of the clearest ways to measure that consistency is by tracking consecutive seasons with at least one player selected to the NBA All-Star Game. While a single All-Star appearance can reflect a breakout season or an extraordinary individual performance, long active streaks tell a much deeper story about organization direction, roster construction and competitive relevance over time.\n\nTeams that maintain extended All-Star streaks rarely do so by accident. These runs often emerge from a combination of smart drafting, effective player development and the ability to either retain or attract elite talent. In many cases, they also reflect continuity — stable coaching systems, clearly defined roles and front offices that prioritize long-term contention over short-term fluctuation. Sustained All-Star representation can also shape perception across the league, reinforcing a franchise’s reputation as a destination for high-level players and meaningful competition.\n\nAt the same time, these streaks reveal the shifting landscape of the league itself. Some franchises extend long-standing traditions of excellence, while others represent newer waves of ascendance powered by emerging superstars. Rebuilding teams may appear briefly before dropping off, while contenders often sustain visibility year after year. Ranking teams by active All-Star streaks offers a snapshot not just of individual recognition, but of which organizations have successfully positioned themselves to matter — consistently — in one of the most competitive talent environments in professional sports.\n\n11 years\nBoston’s streak reflects a franchise that rarely dips out of elite relevance. Over the past decade-plus, they’ve consistently developed or acquired star-level talent capable of representing the Eastern Conference every season. The continuity speaks to strong roster building and a culture that prioritizes high-end two-way players. For this organization, All-Stars aren’t occasional highlights — they’re an expectation.\n\n10 years\nMilwaukee’s run is inseparable from its rise into a modern powerhouse. The franchise built around a generational centerpiece and surrounded him with complementary talent that sustains yearly recognition. Their All-Star streak mirrors their sustained contention in the East. It’s a testament to smart front-office vision and long-term roster stability.\n\n8 years\nStar power is embedded in this franchise’s DNA, and the current streak is another chapter in that tradition. Even through roster transitions, they’ve consistently featured marquee talent that draws league-wide attention. The All-Star Game has long been a familiar stage for their biggest names. Their ability to remain relevant in the spotlight is part of their identity.\n\n8 years\nDenver’s streak reflects the steady rise of a once-understated contender into a championship-caliber force. Built around elite skill, cohesion, and system continuity, their All-Star representation feels like a natural byproduct of winning basketball. The team’s patient development model has paid off year after year. Their consistency has reshaped how the league views the franchise.\n\n7 years\nPhoenix’s streak highlights a franchise that has leaned heavily into high-level offensive talent and dynamic guard play. Their resurgence into contention brought sustained national attention and regular All-Star selections. The organization has shown a willingness to make bold roster moves to maintain star presence. That aggressive approach keeps them firmly in the league’s spotlight.\n\n6 years \nThis run reflects the lingering impact of one of basketball’s defining dynasties. Even as the roster evolves, elite skill and championship pedigree keep producing All-Star-level performances. Their system and culture continue to elevate top-tier talent. For this team, star recognition often follows winning basketball and stylistic influence.\n\n5 years \nCleveland’s streak signals a successful transition into a new competitive era. After rebuilding phases, the franchise has developed and acquired players capable of returning to the league’s elite tier. Their All-Star representation mirrors steady growth and renewed ambition. It’s a sign that their long-term plan is taking shape.\n\n5 years \nMiami’s presence reflects a culture built on conditioning, discipline, and star development. Even when rosters change, the organization finds ways to elevate players into All-Star conversations. Their identity blends structure with individual excellence. Sustained recognition feels like part of their competitive standard.\n\n5 years \nMinnesota’s streak marks a significant shift from years of inconsistency to sustained relevance. Elite individual talent has driven the franchise into the spotlight more consistently than in past eras. Their All-Star representation reflects both development success and competitive growth. It signals a franchise building real momentum.\n\n4 years \nThe Clippers’ run reflects a roster constructed around high-end talent and championship aspirations. Their All-Star appearances align with a period defined by aggressive roster building. Even amid injuries or changes, star presence remains central to their identity. The team continues to chase validation through elite individual performance and team success.\n\n4 years \nIndiana’s streak showcases a franchise that develops playmakers capable of commanding league-wide attention. Their recent offensive surge has elevated individual numbers and visibility. All-Star selections reflect both stylistic evolution and rising competitiveness. The team’s upward trajectory is clearly being noticed.\n\n4 years \nNew York’s streak carries extra weight given the market’s intensity and expectations. When the team fields an All-Star, it often signals broader organizational stability. Their recent run reflects a return to relevance built on toughness and structure. The spotlight has found them again — and stayed.\n\n4 years \nOklahoma City’s streak highlights one of the league’s most successful rebuilds. Draft-driven development and patient planning have produced elite young talent. Their All-Star selections reflect both future potential and present production. The franchise looks positioned for long-term prominence.\n\n3 years \nAtlanta’s streak reflects an offense built around dynamic scoring and playmaking. Their system empowers individual creativity, which translates well into All-Star recognition. The franchise has remained competitive while showcasing high-impact performers. Their star-driven identity continues to shape their trajectory.\n\n2 years \nHouston’s streak signals progress after a deep rebuilding phase. Emerging talent is beginning to translate potential into league-wide recognition. Their All-Star appearances reflect a shift from development to competitiveness. The foundation of their next era is clearly forming.\n\n2 years \nSan Antonio’s presence evokes memories of a long tradition of excellence now entering a new chapter. Their recent All-Star recognition reflects the emergence of transformative young talent. The franchise remains rooted in development and patience. History suggests they know how to build around greatness.\n\n2 years \nDetroit’s streak, though shorter, represents meaningful progress for a rebuilding organization. Individual breakthroughs have begun to emerge from a young core. Their All-Star appearances signal hope for a return to competitiveness. It’s an early indicator of upward movement.\n\n1 year \nPhiladelphia’s single-year streak reflects a moment of transition despite having elite talent in recent seasons. Roster changes and shifting dynamics have reset their current run. Even so, the franchise remains closely tied to star-level expectations. Their All-Star presence often returns quickly when the roster stabilizes.\n\n1 year \nToronto’s recent representation reflects a franchise that continues to develop standout performers even during competitive resets. Their ability to produce All-Star-caliber players has been a defining trait of the modern era. The organization blends development with adaptability. A new core is beginning to shape its identity.\n\n1 year \nPortland’s current streak reflects a new chapter following major roster changes. Emerging talent is stepping into leadership roles and gaining recognition. Their All-Star presence now represents the beginning of a rebuilding timeline rather than the continuation of an established era. It’s the start of something rather than the tail end of something familiar.\n\nActive All-Star streaks ultimately capture more than individual achievement — they reflect organizational health, vision, and competitive staying power. Whether fueled by generational talent, balanced roster construction, or long-term developmental success, each streak tells a story about how a franchise sustains relevance in an ever-changing league. Taken together, these rankings offer a revealing look at which teams have built something durable — and which are still working to get there.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post NBA teams ranked by All-Star streaks appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Karnataka dominated the Ranji Trophy semifinal against Uttarakhand, with KL Rahul (141) and Devdutt Padikkal (148*) smashing commanding centuries. Their massive 278-run partnership powered Karnataka to a strong 355/2 by stumps, leaving Uttarakhand's decision to bowl first looking questionable.",
    "fullText": "Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. \n\nTwo of Karnataka’s most elegant strokemakers — KL Rahul (141; 211b; 11x4; 5x6) and skipper Devdutt Padikkal (148 batting; 236b; 16x4, 2x6) — produced commanding centuries to power their side to 355/2 in 90 overs.\n\nKarnataka began cautiously. Uttarakhand struck in the ninth over when Mayank Agarwal (5), attempting to drive a back of length delivery from Aditya Rawat (2/73), edged to Prashant Chopra at second slip. It proved to be the only breakthrough for the visitors across two sessions.\n\nFrom that point, Rahul and Padikkal stitched together a commanding 278-run partnership for the second wicket — a stand defined by control and classical stroke play. In the near-empty expanse of the Ekana Cricket Stadium, the sound of bat meeting ball — crisp cuts, flowing drives and authoritative pulls — echoed through the day.\n\nPadikkal signalled his intent early, opening his account with a backfoot cut off Aditya to the boundary. A typically assured Rahul was a delight to watch. He drove fluently against the pacers and used his feet confidently against the spinners, rarely allowing the bowlers to settle. His fifty came off 86 deliveries, brought up with a square cut off Aditya.\n\nThere were fleeting opportunities for Uttarakhand. Rahul, on 47, offered a chance when he advanced down the track, only for wicketkeeper Saurabh Rawat to miss a stumping. Later, when Rahul was on 136, a half-chance catch went begging. \n\nRahul reached his 25th first class century off 153 balls, continuing his rich vein of form following a match-winning 130 against Mumbai in the quarterfinal. Left-arm spinner Mayank Mishra, Uttarakhand’s leading wicket-taker this season, was introduced in the 18th over but found little assistance from the surface and struggled to contain the flow of runs.\n\nAt the other end, Padikkal matched his senior partner stroke for stroke. His half-century came briskly off 65 deliveries. The landmark moment of his innings arrived when he launched former Karnataka teammate J Suchith for a one-handed six over long-on to bring up his hundred.\n\nAditya eventually broke the stand when Rahul closed the face of the bat a touch early and offered a leading edge back to the bowler. It was, however, only a momentary respite for Uttarakhand.\n\nWith Karnataka’s depth, the run feast continued. Karun Nair (37 batting) joined Padikkal and seamlessly carried the momentum forward. Karun marked the team’s 300 with a deft glance to fine leg for four.\n\nBrief scores: Karnataka 355/2 in 90 overs (KL Rahul 141, Devdutt Padikkal 148 (batting), Karun Nair (batting) 37; Aditya Rawat 2-73) vs Uttarakhand.",

    "description": "Four years after heartbreak in Beijing, Kristen Santos-Griswold is still looking for her first medal.",
    "fullText": "MILAN — Say “speed skating” out loud. There, you just covered the difference between success and failure in the Olympics. Four years of training, four years of work, four years of hopes and dreams … and you might fall short by a third of a second.\n\nKristen Santos-Griswold has spent the last four years training for Monday morning. One of the world’s best short-track speed skaters, Santos-Griswold was leading the 1000m race in Beijing when she was taken out on the final lap. She would go on to finish fourth, the most agonizing of all places in the Olympics.\n\n“The hardest part about this sport,” Santos-Griswold said recently, “is that kind of concept of, you can be the best, you can be the fastest, and things just don't work out for you.”\n\nShe spent months after that 2022 heartbreak trying to figure out whether she wanted to commit another four years to training, knowing every minute of every day that it could all end in the literal blink of an eye.\n\n“I had to really sit there and think, if in four years the same thing happens again, would that be worth it?” she said recently. “Obviously, I’m here. So I did decide that it would be.”\n\nMonday morning, Santos-Griswold put that mindset to the test as she stood on the starting line for the 1000m, this time in the quarterfinals. She needed to finish first or second, or notch one of the fastest third-place times in the quarterfinals, to advance to the semis.\n\nThe race began cleanly, a sharp contrast from her four-start 500m race a few days ago. And very quickly, Santos-Griswold climbed into first place … which was exactly where she didn’t want to be. Within a few laps, her pursuers caught her, and she couldn’t make up the ground.\n\n“I just expected it to start a bit faster, and that I was going to sit in second or something,” she said a few minutes after the finish. “Then when it didn't, it's like, Alright, I've got to make a move and kind of pick it up a bit.”\n\nShe couldn’t, finishing in third place by 0.34 seconds. Worse, her time of 1:29.102 wasn’t fast enough to qualify her as a third-place finisher. And thus, her hopes for 1000m redemption ended right there in the quarterfinals.\n\nThis is the cruelty of short-track speed skating. Other Olympic sports have margins of victory measured in the tenths, hundredths, even thousandths of a second. But none of the athletes in those sports — skiing, biathlon, luge, and so on — have their competition literally entangled with them the way short-track speed skating does.\n\nSure, there are rules. You can’t impede a skater while they’re attempting a pass, you can’t “brake-check” a fellow skater, you can’t throw your blades around. But beyond that, collisions can and do happen. And when you’re whipping around a sheet of ice at 30 miles an hour on millimeter-thick blades, well … there’s a reason why short tracks have massive pads encircling the rink. It’s a safe bet someone’s going to fly into them at high speed.\n\nWith all that tension and pressure, it’s a wonder short-track skaters aren’t puddles of anxiety. Even so, Santos-Griswold has been open about her nerves before races, and she spoke of that on Monday following the end of her 1000m event.\n\n“I get very nervous and anxious before races, but I just try to take it one step at a time,” she said. “I try to go into it knowing that I'm as prepared as possible, but without the thought of, ‘I've sacrificed so much,’ and more like, ‘I'm here because I want to be here.’”\n\nSantos-Griswold has one individual race, the 1500m, remaining in her Milan Olympics … and, probably, her Olympic career as a whole. One more chance to cap off her comeback with a medal, even if she’s already validated it to herself.\n\n“I think I'll have to talk to my coaches and figure out maybe a different plan, and how I'm going to capitalize on the race at the end more,” she said. “You can never really predict what anyone's going to do, so it's just what it is.”\n\nMaybe she’ll be more at ease with the randomness of this sport and the near-misses of her Olympics in the coming days and years. But in the moment, she sure sounded like she was trying to convince herself.",

    "fullText": "It has been a miserable season for Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who has made only three appearances for Barcelona and Girona. The 33-year-old missed almost the entire first half of the season as he was recovery from back surgery, and after moving to Montilivi, he featured twice before tearing his hamstring.\n\nThere is little chance of ter Stegen returning to action before April, which means he would have a matter of weeks to get himself up to speed ahead of this summer’s World Cup. He has hopes of being Germany’s starter at a major tournament for the very first time, although his injury woes have left these in tatters.\n\nRecent comments by Germany head coach Julian Nagelsmann have appeared to back this up. As per Sempre Barca, he has admitted that ter Stegen’s current situation makes it difficult for him to be called up for the World Cup.\n\n“There are three things to consider regarding the goalkeeper position. It’s a tragic injury (for ter Stegen), which I deeply regret. I will never rule him out completely because it is his turn. We have to make the right decision for him and for us. And at the moment, the situation is not favourable.”\n\nGiven that he is 33 years of age, ter Stegen will not have too many years left in football – especially consider his recent injury woes. This summer’s World Cup would have been the perfect time for him to be a starter for Germany at a major tournament, and at this stage, it appears that it will pass him by.\n\nGermany have a number of talented younger goalkeepers rising through the ranks, such as Bayern Munich’s Jonas Urbig and Freiburg’s Noah Atubolu. Both will fancy their chances of ousting ter Stegen in the coming years, and especially before the 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco.",

    "fullText": "Ben White was substituted during Arsenal’s FA Cup victory over Wigan after appearing to sustain an injury, prompting concern among supporters. The defender completed 79 minutes before being withdrawn, raising immediate questions about his fitness at a crucial stage of the season.\n\nWhite has been an influential figure for the Gunners in recent weeks, enjoying substantial playing time and delivering consistent performances. Despite the depth within Arsenal’s squad, his importance to the team remains significant. His versatility and reliability have made him a valuable asset across competitions, and the coaching staff would undoubtedly prefer to have him available as they navigate a demanding schedule.\n\nWhen White limped off the pitch, both fans and members of the coaching team would have feared that he had added his name to an already growing injury list. Arsenal have faced several fitness setbacks in recent months, and any additional absence could have disrupted their rhythm across domestic and cup competitions.\n\nAt this stage of the campaign, maintaining squad stability is essential. White’s presence has contributed to the team’s defensive organisation and overall balance, and his potential unavailability would have represented a significant concern.\n\n(Photo by Richard Heathcote/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, there appears to be encouraging news regarding his situation. According to Football Insider, the defender has confirmed that he is fine. This update suggests that he has not sustained an injury serious enough to keep him sidelined.\n\nAs a result, there is optimism that White will be available for selection in Arsenal’s next fixture. Such reassurance will come as a relief to supporters and teammates alike, particularly given the intensity of the upcoming schedule. Avoiding another injury setback could prove crucial as Arsenal continue their pursuit of success across multiple competitions.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!

    "fullText": "The January transfer window provides clubs with a chance to strengthen mid-season, and several winter window signings already look fine business.\n\nHere are five January signings that have hit the ground running.\n\nAntoine Semenyo's superb start at Bournemouth indicated the winger was ready for the next step, but few could have envisioned the ease at which he has slotted into the Manchester City side.\n\nSemenyo scored and assisted on debut in theFA Cup thrashing of Exeter City last month and has continued to shine as part of the club's new-look frontline.\n\nHe's scored five times and added two assists in just nine appearances for the Citizens and certainly looks the part in Sky Blue.\n\nEndrick badly needed a loan in January. The 19-year-old was afforded just 12 minutes ofLa Liga football over the first half of the campaign, before heading to France in search of minutes. Lyon loaned in the forward, who is thriving in Ligue 1.\n\nEndrick marked his debut with a goal against Lille, before netting a hat-trick in a 5-2 thrashing of Metz.\n\nHe's joined a Lyon side who are on a formidable run of 13 wins in a row in all competitions and was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month for January.\n\nHe's back in the frame for the Brazil squad for this summer's World Cup.\n\nAtletico Madrid made a move for Ademola Lookman in January, agreeing a deal to sign the winger from Atalanta for just north of £30m. The Nigerian has quickly made that fee look like a bargain with an electric start for the Rojiblancos.\n\nHe's scored twice and provided two assists in just three appearances, and was a standout asAtletico thrashed Barcelona 4-0 in the Copa del Rey earlier this month.\n\nAtletico have a rich history when it comes to forwards and Lookman is aiming to write his own chapter.\n\nDonyell Malen's time atAston Villa was a curious case. Parachuted in last January, he was afforded just seven league starts in his 12 months at the club.\n\nDespite that, Malen scored sevenPremier League goals across those limited minutes in a hint of what was to come in Rome.\n\nThe Dutchman has made an immediate impact with five goals in fiveSerie A games. Trusted as the club's focal point under Gian Piero Gasperini, his form has helped Roma's bid for Champions League qualification.\n\nIt looks likely that the capital club will activate the €25m purchase option in his loan.\n\nWest Ham's striker curse has been well documented, with the Hammers having trouble finding the right man to lead the line. Taty Castellanos came in from Lazio in January, with some dubious given a modest goal record in Italy.\n\nThe Argentine has scored just twice in eight appearances for West Ham, but his profile has provided Nuno Espirito Santo with a badly needed target.\n\nWest Ham have won three times in six games with Castellanos in the side, as many wins as in their previous 20 games.",

    "fullText": "If the Jacksonville Jaguars choose to address the cornerback position in free agency, who are the best available free agent options for them?\n\nThis is a position that may be one of the more pressing needs that the Jaguars have this offseason.\n\nStill under contract are Jourdan Lewis, Jarrian Jones, and Travis Hunter, who will reportedly be a full-time cornerback in 2026, but with Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome set to be free agents, that starting outside cornerback role opposite of Hunter is open at the moment.\n\nPerhaps there isn't much mystery to who will end up filling that role. According to the NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe, it's \"expected\" that at least one of Brown and/or Newsome won't return. If the Jaguars are deciding between Brown and Newsome, the choice seems to be clear.\n\nHowever, even if Brown or Newsome are back, the depth at cornerback could still be added to -- although, admittedly, in this instance, the Jaguars likely won't be breaking the salary cap bank to do so. The draft, where Jacksonville has 11 picks, could be the better alternative as well.\n\nBut if the Jaguars choose to go in a different direction at cornerback or Gladstone again surprises us, as he's often done as the Jaguars' GM, here are the best available free agent options with help from PFF's big board.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: Jaguars free agency: Top free agent cornerbacks for 2026 offseason",

(Skiing) is a sport of fine margins and this kind of thing happens more often than not in training, where it's like, 'I don't quite feel comfortable'.\n\n\"I'm going to have to learn what to do, what to adjust. There's a certain amount of luck when it goes right, but there's also a feeling that I'm going to work, to achieve for the slalom race coming up.”\n\nSunday's giant slalom may now have served as a turning point in this respect.\n\nShiffrin has rarely contested the discipline since a heavy crash in late 2024 in discipline which sidelined her for weeks.\n\nShe delighted that she still managed to ski within three-tenth off the podium which together with the atmosphere in Cortina gave her a lot of positive feelings.\n\n\"To be here now, not far from the fastest women, is huge for me so I'm proud of that,\" she said.\n\n\"It was a beautiful day of racing, really good conditions, and sunny. One of those days you can really enjoy. I was pushing, trying to turn any nervous energy into a sort of intensity.\"\n\nShiffrin will now hope to carry this feel-good factor into her main race at the Games.",

    "fullText": "Every offseason brings speculation, projection models, and plenty of debate — but nothing captures long-range anticipation quite like the way-too-early MVP odds. Before a single snap of the season is played, sportsbooks and analysts are already trying to forecast which superstar will dominate the narrative across the NFL landscape in 2026. These early numbers don’t just reflect talent — they reflect team trajectory, offensive stability, durability, and the ever-important storylines that shape voter perception.\n\nAt the front of the conversation are familiar faces who’ve already proven they can carry franchises and command national attention. Josh Allen remains a perennial contender because of his rare blend of physicality and high-volume production. Lamar Jackson continues to redefine quarterback play with explosive dual-threat impact that can reshape games week to week. Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes is almost permanently positioned in MVP discussions simply because excellence has become routine.\n\nJust behind them sit elite passers still chasing that defining MVP season. Justin Herbert possesses statistical upside that could translate into award recognition if team success follows. And Joe Burrow continues to build a résumé centered on precision, composure, and winning in high-leverage moments.\n\nOf course, “way too early” is the operative phrase. Injuries, breakout stars, coaching changes, and unexpected team surges will inevitably reshape the race. But right now, these odds offer a snapshot of who the football world expects to define the 2026 season — and whose performance could ultimately shape the league’s competitive hierarchy.\n\nOdds: +550\nAllen’s MVP case always starts with his physical dominance — few quarterbacks can stress defenses as both a power runner and vertical passer the way he does. If his efficiency stabilizes late in the season and turnover swings tighten up, he becomes incredibly hard to beat in voting. A top seed paired with highlight-reel production would make him the clear betting favorite.\n\nOdds: +650\nJackson’s ceiling is still unmatched when his rushing explosiveness and passing rhythm peak at the same time. Voters tend to reward his dual-threat dominance when his offense is built around his improvisational strengths. Another season where he controls tempo and stays healthy deep into January would put him squarely in the MVP spotlight again.\n\nOdds: +1000\nMahomes is almost permanently in the MVP conversation because of how consistently he elevates his offense regardless of surrounding personnel. If his statistical output rebounds into league-leading territory while maintaining elite situational play, the narrative momentum quickly returns. He’s the classic “never count him out” candidate when big moments pile up.\n\nOdds: +1000\nHerbert’s MVP path hinges on translating elite arm talent into sustained team success over a full season. When his deep passing and high-volume production align with efficient red-zone execution, his numbers look historic. A breakout year in the win column could finally convert his statistical brilliance into major award recognition.\n\nOdds: +1000\nBurrow’s candidacy thrives on precision, timing, and leadership in high-leverage moments. When his offense operates at peak efficiency and he controls games late, voters tend to gravitate toward his poised style. If he combines elite passing totals with another deep playoff push narrative, his MVP momentum can surge quickly.\n\nEarly MVP odds are less prediction and more temperature check — a reflection of reputation, momentum, and projected opportunity. They highlight who the league believes will matter most before the season even begins. And while the eventual winner often emerges from unexpected circumstances, these early favorites set the stage for the narratives, rivalries, and performances that will define the 2026 MVP race.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Way too early NFL MVP odds for 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The NFL offseason doesn't officially start until March 11 but the Ravens' biggest roster question is already staring them in the face. Baltimore is projected to be tight against the salary cap, and unless Lamar Jackson and the team work out an extension that creates breathing room, the front office may be forced into difficult decisions — including the possibility of trading a cornerstone defender like Marlon Humphrey.\n\nHumphrey is entering the final year of his contract and carries a cap hit of roughly $26 million in 2026. A first-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft out of Alabama, Humphrey has been one of the faces of Baltimore's defense for nearly a decade. But his 2025 season was a step back, as opposing quarterbacks targeted him more often and missed tackles occasionally turned into drive-extending plays.\n\nWith new head coach Jesse Minter taking over the defense and installing his scheme, Humphrey could be positioned for a bounce-back season in 2026. Still, the Ravens' financial flexibility may ultimately come down to what happens with Jackson's contract — whether Baltimore chooses to restructure it or make a more dramatic move involving one of its most recognizable veterans. Either way, Humphrey's future is suddenly one of the biggest storylines of Baltimore's offseason — and the cap math may decide it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ravens Wire: Ravens' salary cap crunch could put Marlon Humphrey on the trade block",

    "fullText": "Yan Diomande had a chance to join Chelsea before moving to RB Leipzig, but the 19-year-old chose to go in a different direction.\n\nHe is one of the brightest young players in Germany at the moment. With Leipzig missing out on Champions League football this season, their attention has shifted solely to the Bundesliga, where the Ivorian winger has been thriving.\n\nSo far this season, Diomande has eight goals and three assists from his role out wide. That’s a strong showing for someone still so early in his career.\n\nThe former Leganes prospect, who has found success at the Red Bull Arena, shared details of his path to the club, a path that notably included declining an offer from Chelsea.\n\nDespite Chelsea being one of the world’s biggest clubs, Diomande has no regrets about rejecting them.\n\nHis decision to play for Leganes and then move on to Leipzig has given him the chance to grow on the pitch, something he felt might not have happened if he had joined the Blues.\n\nSpeaking to Bild, Diomande explained: “A lot of people told me I absolutely had to play for Chelsea. Then I stopped everything and made a decision for myself. I knew the president of Leganes; he had helped with my move to the USA.\n\n“Suddenly, I was faced with a choice: Leganes or Chelsea? It was risky, but luckily, it was the right decision. I think patience is very important in football. It’s not always just about money. If you play well, it will come naturally. I’m young; I need to play to increase my sporting value, to improve. And I wouldn’t get that on the bench.”\n\nChelsea have their own promising young wingers in Estevao Willian and Geovany Quenda.\n\nThe 18-year-old Brazilian recently scored his seventh goal of the season during a 4-0 win over Hull City in the FA Cup.\n\nChelsea’s interest in Diomande remains despite the club already having young prospects like Estevao, Quenda, Pedro Neto, Jamie Gittens, and Alejandro Garnacho.\n\nDespite claims last month that Chelsea remains interested in Diomande, securing a deal is not expected to be straightforward.\n\nOther big clubs around Europe are also watching him closely, and the asking price is going to be steep.\n\nChristian Falk reported on CF Bayern Insider that Leipzig have set an £87m price tag for Diomande. That figure has already put off Bayern Munich, and it remains to be seen if Chelsea would consider meeting it.\n\nWhy Mohamed Salah’s words on Dominik Szoboszlai could irk Chelsea supporters\n\nMamadou Sarr enters exclusive Chelsea company alongside Deco and Gonzalo Higuain",

    "fullText": "Collin Morikawa finally won another PGA Tour event at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am last weekend.\n\nThe 29-year-old produced a 10-under-par 62 on Saturday, probably the best round of his entire career, to enter the fray.\n\nHe then sealed the deal with a five-under-par 67 on Sunday to beat Min Woo Lee and Sepp Straka by one stroke.\n\nIn his press conference after the tournament, Morikawa was particularly pleased with one shot in the final round, which demonstrated great “artistry.”\n\nCollin Morikawa has previously explained how he fell out of love with golf over the last few years.\n\nHe was desperate to return to his child-like approach of enjoying hitting creative shots rather than plotting his way around the course.\n\n“With more and more technology, it’s great to advance and then figure out what you need to do better and how to perfect certain things, how to hit great shots,” Morikawa said after the Pebble Beach Pro-Am.\n\n“But there’s an art, and we’re artists at heart. As I said, I’ve gone away from that a little bit. It’s funny, I watched my shot yesterday after we played on 17, and the announcer or whoever’s talking said, ‘Oh, man, I’m hitting a draw.’\n\n“It’s like, I still know how to hit these shots. I play golf, and we hit some shots. I just like to play the fade more often than not because I know most of the time what it’s going to do. So for me, being able to picture those shots and seeing the curvature, how the wind’s going to affect it.”\n\nMorikawa was delighted with his display of “artistry” on the par-3 7th hole at Pebble Beach on Sunday.\n\nHe hit his 9-iron approach shot from 111 yards out to less than six feet, which he converted into an outstanding birdie.\n\n“Today, the best shot I think I hit was probably on 7,” Morikawa claimed. “I’ve stood on that tee when it’s been really windy, and you start thinking about numbers, you start thinking about is 9-iron enough, is it 8-iron, is it a wedge?

    "fullText": "Skier Eileen Gu slammed the International Ski and Snowboard Federation after her request for additional practice time was denied\n\nGu, who is the only athlete competing in slopestyle, halfpipe and big air, said she \"asked for fair options\" to give her practice time \"to no avail\"\n\nGu called the overlap \"a totally avoidable issue\" and said she's \"saddened by the hardline stance FIS has chosen to take\"\n\nSkier Eileen Gu called out the Olympics for a \"totally avoidable issue\" regarding scheduling.\n\nThe 22-year-old representing Team China — who is the only athlete competing in slopestyle, halfpipe and big air — penned a lengthy post on Sunday, Feb. 15 after she qualified for the upcoming big air final at the 2026 Winter Olympics, telling fans she will be forced to miss \"an entire day of pipe training\" after the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) denied her request for additional practice time.\n\n\"Unfortunately, @fisparkandpipe has scheduled big air finals and pipe training with 100% overlap, which means I’ll now be missing an entire day of pipe training,\" Gu wrote. \"I have asked for fair options like joining one training with the snowboarders, or getting even one hour alone to train, but to no avail.\"\n\nGu continued, \"No other woman in the halfpipe field is competing in another event, and for good reason - Halfpipe is different from slope and big air, and demands its own training time accordingly.\"\n\nThe women's freeski big air final begins at 7:30 p.m. local time in Livigno, Italy on Monday. The women's freeski halfpipe qualification round begins on Friday.\n\nThe two-time gold medalist called the Olympics \"the stage upon which miracles materialize and the impossible ceases to be so right before our very eyes,\" in the post, adding that the Games \"inspire both athletes and sports lovers to dream big and break limits.\"\n\nThen, she said the FIS' decision not to grant her additional practice time is \"disappointing to me because it seems to contradict the spirit of the games.\"\n\n\"Daring to be the only woman to compete in three events should not be penalized - making finals in one event should not disadvantage me in another,\" Gu wrote, posing the question, \"What kind of message does this send to future athletes who love skiing for its essence and want to compete in every event?\"\n\nGu called the overlap \"a totally avoidable issue\" and said she's \"saddened by the hardline stance FIS has chosen to take.\"\n\nGu concluded her post telling fans she's \"proud of\" herself \"for being willing to give big air my best shot,\" and said she's \"looking forward to competing tomorrow night under the lights with this incredible field of women.\"\n\nFIS representative Bruno Sassi told PEOPLE on Feb. 16, \"Constructing the Olympic competition program is a complex process requiring extensive cooperation between the IOC and the International Federations representing the thousands of athletes at these Games.\"\n\nSassi added, \"Every effort has been made to facilitate the best possible training and competition schedule for athletes across the myriad FIS-governed events, but as we have already seen at these Games, for athletes who choose to compete in multiple disciplines and/or multiple events, conflicts can sometimes be inevitable.\"\n\nAfter qualifying for the final, Gu told reporters she thinks the scheduling conflict is \"really unfair\" and \"punishing excellence,\" according to NBC, and added, “I think the Olympics should epitomize aspiration, and I think being able to do something that’s beyond the ordinary should be celebrated instead of punished.”\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "fullText": "Inter President Beppe Marotta feels Alessandro Bastoni has been subject to ‘excessive media exposure’ and hits back at Juventus, saying that a ‘clear simulation’ of Juan Cuadrado in 2021 allowed the Bianconeri to beat the Nerazzurri and qualify for the Champions League.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Inter-Juventus and a red card shown to Pierre Kalulu on Saturday is far from over.\n\nInter President Marotta spoke to reporters on Monday ahead of a Lega Serie A meeting in Milan, saying (via Calciomercato.com): “I’m here because we have fought against excessive media exposure, a public shaming of Bastoni that goes beyond what actually happened. A young man who represents an asset for our national team, it is unfair to put his participation in doubt.\n\n“Who doesn’t make mistakes? Since the 1950s, there have been players, no names mentioned, famous for actions like this. We are facing, in my view, an ordinary event, not an extraordinary one. Reprehensible, but also due to other circumstances, such as the wide arm,” Marotta continued.\n\nepa09202476 Juventus’ Juan Cuadrado (R) scores the 2-1 lead during the Italian Serie A soccer match between Juventus FC and Inter Milan in Turin, Italy, 15 May 2021. EPA-EFE/ALESSANDRO DI MARCO\n\n“Last season, we lost the Scudetto by one point, and there was a confirmed error in Inter-Roma, but we didn’t protest. This season, Inter have only intervened once, after Napoli-Inter, where a penalty kick, later deemed unfair, had been given.”\n\nItalian media already reported that Inter felt Juventus’ reaction was blown out of proportion, a view strongly confirmed by Marotta.\n\n“If we talk about simulations, I want to remember Juventus-Inter in 2021 and a penalty given despite a clear simulation from Cuadrado with Calvarese as a referee,” he said.\n\nPARMA, ITALY – APRIL 05: Giuseppe Marotta Chairman of FC Internazionale looks on prior to the Serie A match between Parma and FC Internazionale at Stadio Ennio Tardini on April 05, 2025 in Parma, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\n“Afterwards, both the referee and the technical bodies confirmed it had been an obvious simulation, and with that win, Juventus qualified for the Champions League, which is worth €60-70m.”\n\nMarotta admitted that Bastoni’s simulation against Juventus was against the principles of fair play, and also called for stronger sanctions.\n\n“We need to take responsibility: AIA, clubs and FIGC, all institutions,” he added.\n\nBOLOGNA, ITALY – DECEMBER 14: Former Juventus player Giorgio Chiellini looks on prior to the Serie A match between Bologna FC 1909 and Juventus FC at Renato Dall’Ara Stadium on December 14, 2025 in Bologna, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\n“We need to engage in a broad and calm discussion, toughening disciplinary penalties, especially financial ones. Too often, things go beyond the line, and that is unacceptable. Bastoni’s gesture does not align with the principles of fair play. Repression is not part of my approach. Prevention, however, is possiblethrough dialogue. There is often a lack of knowledge of the rules, which players in particular should be familiar with.”\n\nJuventus director Giorgio Chiellini was particularly critical of the officiating as he and Damien Comolli showed up in front of the media after the match on Saturday night, while coach Luciano Spalletti remained silent.\n\nMarotta had greeted Chiellini at San Siro, but didn’t seem impressed by the ex-defender’s claims.\n\n“It was the least I could do as he was one of my players,” he concluded, via Gazzetta.\n\n“Today, he’s a young and inexperienced director, but I do not dare give him suggestions.”",

    "fullText": "If the Indianapolis Colts are going to address the cornerback position in free agency, who are the best available options?\n\nThe Colts' cornerback position dealt with numerous injuries last season, but this is a unit that GM Chris Ballard has invested very heavily in and one that could be a strength of this team in 2026.\n\nSince last offseason, we've seen Ballard sign Charvarius Ward in free agency, use a third-round pick on Justin Walley, and then trade for Sauce Gardner. Kenny Moore is also under contract as well.\n\nWith that said, there does seem to be some uncertainty around Ward's NFL future after he suffered three concussions last season. But Walley, Jaylon Jones, Mekhi Blackmon, Cameron Mitchell, and Johnathan Edwards remain on the roster.\n\nGiven the resources already invested in the cornerback position, if an addition is made here, I don't know how big a swing Ballard takes. But if he's going to remain aggressive, here are the best available free agent options with help from PFF's big board.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: 10 best available free agent cornerbacks in 2026 offseason for Colts",

    "fullText": "The Premier League and English Football League will resume their procedures for Ramadan, with matches pausing briefly to allow Muslim players to break their fast.\n\nRamadan starts this week and will last for a month. During the this time, Muslims abstain from food and drink from dawn until sunset.\n\nWith sunset in the UK ranging from about 17:00 to 19:00 GMT during this period, the only games that could see a break in play will be Saturday's 17:30 kick-off and Sunday's 16:30 kick-off.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, club captains alongside match officials will find a natural pause in the game to allow Muslim players or match officials to break their fast.\n\nTeams and match officials will discuss beforehand whether a pause is required and an approximate time for the stoppage will be agreed.\n\nPlay will not stop while matches are in mid-flow but at the earliest convenient moment during a goal-kick, free-kick or throw-in.\n\nIn 2021, an agreement was put in place to allow Muslim players to break their fast during a Premier League match.\n\nThis first break took place in a game between Leicester City and Crystal Palace in April 2021. The match was paused at a goal-kick around the half-hour mark to allow Leicester's Wesley Fofana and Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate to replenish themselves with liquids and energy gels.\n\nOne of the five pillars of Islam is that during Ramadan, Muslims fast during daylight hours to show their devotion to their religion.\n\nMuslim names in the Premier League include Mohamed Salah, William Saliba, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Amad Diallo among others.\n\n\"In the Premier League you are free to do whatever suits you. They will never do anything against your faith and this is great,\" former Everton player Abdoulaye Doucoure told BBC Sport in 2023.\n\n\"I fast every day, I don't miss any day. It has become normal and very easy for me. Training is still the same during Ramadan but when we go [for away matches], we might need to eat later than the others so the chef prepares food for us, making sure everything is in place as at home. We get halal food so there are no problems,\" Doucoure added.\n\nAnd in 2022, former Liverpool player Sadio Mane revealed the club altered their training schedules to support their Muslim players during the month of Ramadan.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "In today’s NBA, greatness isn’t just measured in championships and MVP trophies — it’s also reflected in career earnings that tell the story of longevity, dominance, and timing. The list of the highest NBA career earners of all time is more than a financial ranking; it’s a snapshot of an era where superstar impact and league revenue have grown side by side. As television deals expanded, the salary cap exploded, and max contracts reached historic heights, the league’s elite were positioned to benefit like never before.\n\nAt the very top sits LeBron James, whose career earnings surpass half a billion dollars — a staggering figure that mirrors his two decades of excellence. Close behind are generational talents like Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, players who not only defined their era but helped reshape the modern game. From revolutionary shooting to unstoppable scoring versatility, their contracts reflect both production and influence.\n\nWhat makes this list compelling is how it blends sustained superstardom with strategic career moves. Long-term extensions, supermax deals, and loyalty to franchises all play a role. These numbers represent more than paydays — they symbolize trust from organizations, global marketability, and consistent elite performance. In many ways, this ranking captures the business evolution of basketball just as much as it honors the players themselves.\n\nLeBron’s longevity and sustained dominance are simply unmatched. From his early days in Cleveland to championships in Miami, Cleveland again, and Los Angeles, he has maximized every contract with superstar-level performance. Even in his 20th-plus season range, he’s still producing at an elite level, proving that his earning power has mirrored his greatness on the court.\n\nDurant’s smooth scoring ability made him one of the most sought-after superstars of his era. His championships with Golden State, combined with MVP-level play throughout his career, positioned him for massive max contracts. Even after major injuries, his value never dipped, a testament to his pure offensive brilliance.\n\nCurry revolutionized basketball with his shooting range and off-ball movement. As the face of a dynasty in Golden State, he earned historic extensions that reflected both his impact and loyalty. His contracts symbolize how the modern NBA now prioritizes skill, spacing, and transformative talent.\n\nHarden’s offensive peak in Houston was one of the most statistically explosive stretches in league history. His ability to control tempo, draw fouls, and score in isolation made him a perennial MVP candidate. Those dominant years translated into massive contracts that cemented his financial legacy in the league.\n\nPaul has long been considered one of the greatest floor generals in NBA history. His leadership, mid-range mastery, and basketball IQ consistently elevated every team he joined. Even into his late 30s, teams valued his presence enough to keep him among the league’s highest earners.\n\nGeorge’s two-way versatility made him one of the most complete wings of his generation. Whether in Indiana, Oklahoma City, or Los Angeles, he has been a consistent All-Star presence. His max-level deals reflect the premium the NBA places on elite perimeter defenders who can also score at all three levels.\n\nLeonard built his career on quiet dominance and postseason excellence. From Finals MVP honors in San Antonio to delivering Toronto its first championship, his résumé speaks volumes. Even with load management and injuries, his championship pedigree secured him massive long-term deals.\n\nButler’s rise from late first-round pick to franchise leader is one of the league’s best development stories. His relentless competitiveness and playoff heroics elevated Miami into multiple deep postseason runs. Those performances solidified his reputation as a max-contract cornerstone.\n\nLillard’s loyalty to Portland defined much of his career and led to record-setting extensions. Known for clutch shooting and fearless range, he became one of the league’s most respected leaders. His earning total reflects both individual brilliance and the financial power of long-term franchise commitment.\n\nDavis has consistently been one of the NBA’s most dominant two-way big men. His defensive versatility and inside scoring helped deliver a championship in Los Angeles. When healthy, he’s a franchise-altering force, and his contracts have reflected that elite impact.\n\nUltimately, the highest career earners in NBA history represent the intersection of talent, timing, and transformation within the league. Their earnings are a testament to sustained excellence and the NBA’s unprecedented financial growth. As the salary cap continues to rise, this list will evolve — but it will always be anchored by the legends who set the financial standard.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Highest NBA career earnings of all-time appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona centre-back Pau Cubarsi has quickly become one of the most exciting young defenders in European football.\n\nStill in his teens, the La Masia graduate has already established himself as a regular in the first team, showing maturity well beyond his age.\n\nIn a recent interview with French outlet L’Equipe, as relayed by MARCA, the defender opened up about his debut under former manager Xavi Hernandez, his life away from the pitch, and his bond with teammate Lamine Yamal.\n\nCubarsi made his official debut for the senior side in January 2024, just four days before turning 17.\n\nIt was a special moment for the youngster, who had grown through the ranks at La Masia and suddenly found himself playing with some of the biggest names in world football.\n\nReflecting on that early breakthrough, he spoke about a memorable moment in the dressing room involving Xavi and Robert Lewandowski.\n\n“The day after my debut as a starter in LaLiga against Betis, Xavi congratulated me and wished me a happy birthday in front of everyone.\n\n“Robert Lewandowski came up to me and said, ‘Are you really 17?’. He couldn’t believe his eyes. Maybe I still looked like a kid,” he recalled.\n\nAway from the pressure of elite football, Cubarsi remains closely connected to his roots. The defender explained that he still enjoys returning to his family home, where life is far removed from the spotlight of Camp Nou.\n\nSpeaking about the peaceful environment he grew up in, he described the simple joys that help him disconnect from football.\n\n“At my parents’ house, there are sheep, two dogs, chickens, ducks.\n\n“The sheep graze on the lawn, and we eat the delicious fresh eggs laid by our chickens. When I go back, I completely disconnect,” he said.\n\nPau Cubarsi has grown from strength to strength. (Photo by Aitor Alcalde/Getty Images)\n\nAnother important part of his journey has been growing alongside Lamine Yamal, with whom he shares a long history in Barcelona’s youth teams.\n\nBoth players rose through La Masia at a similar time and now represent the club’s future.\n\nCubarsi admitted that playing with Yamal has always felt natural, even from a young age.\n\n“Lamine and I have practically the same professional career. He progressed even faster.\n\n“It’s very easy to play with him. You give him the ball and he decides the game. Since he was a child, he has had that gift for deciding the game.\n\n“Once, in training, during a one-on-one, he dribbled past me. I slipped and ended up on the ground. He teased me about it all week afterwards.\n\n“But what he doesn’t mention is that he shot… at me! (smiles). As long as it doesn’t end up in a goal, for a defender, it’s fine,” he remembered.\n\nThe youngster also shared a lighter moment from his first year in the senior side.\n\nDuring a match against Red Star in 2024, he suffered a facial cut and had to wear protective gear in the following game.\n\nThe unusual look became a source of jokes inside the dressing room.\n\n“In order to play against Real Sociedad a few days later, I had to wear a protective helmet that made me look like a McDonald’s employee.\n\n“My teammates called me the McDonald’s waiter,” he noted.",

    "fullText": "Former Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti criticized Juventus for their hypocrisy in the aftermath of the Derby d’Italia.\n\nSpeaking to Radio anch’io Sport via FCInter1908, Moratti delivered his verdict on Saturday’s incident at San Siro.\n\nAlessandro Bastoni came under heavy scrutiny after drawing an unfair red card from Pierre Kalulu.\n\nIndeed, the 26-year-old tricked referee Federico La Penna into showing the Frenchman a second yellow card in the first half.\n\nFurthermore, cameras caught the Nerazzurri star celebrating the red card with apparent excitement, intensifying the backlash from fans.\n\nReduced to ten men, Juventus fought tooth and nail to avoid defeat, but Piotr Zielinski scored a last-gasp winner for Inter.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bianconeri supporters have aimed death threats at Bastoni, forcing the player to turn off comments on social media.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that several high-ranking Juventus members had a tunnel confrontation with La Penna.\n\nOne of them was the legendary captain and current director Giorgio Chiellini.\n\nGENOA, ITALY – DECEMBER 14: Alessandro Bastoni of Inter celebrates after the Serie A match between Genoa CFC and FC Internazionale at Luigi Ferraris Stadium on December 14, 2025 in Genoa, Italy. (Photo by Simone Arveda/Getty Images)\n\n“Simulations are annoying, even when a player pretends to take a blow to the face but actually gets hit in the chest,” Massimo Moratti said.\n\n“They’re frustrating. Bastoni’s was an enthusiastic simulation; he jumped dramatically from a stretch of the opponent’s arm.\n\n“The opponent later regretted it, but he had extended his arm and put Bastoni in a position to take advantage.\n\n“So, let’s say the youngster got carried away by the opportunity, and it ended up being unfair.\n\n“Kalulu didn’t commit a foul, and Bastoni deserved something for his simulation.\n\n“Regarding Bastoni, I think Gattuso doesn’t need to punish him,” Moratti added.\n\n“For Bastoni, the attacks he’s facing from everyone else are already a punishment. It seems to me there’s no need for more.\n\n“I don’t know what poor Bastoni went through in that moment, but now he’s in the middle of a storm. Poor guy.\n\n“I hope it passes quickly, that what he did doesn’t become an example, and instead it serves to behave correctly.\n\n“There’s no point in dragging it out for a year; we understand it was a mistake and he was wrong.”\n\nMoratti then slammed Juventus for ‘playing the victim.’\n\n“Times have changed; now Juventus complains, acts like the victim, and they are certainly reacting to something new.\n\n“It seems to me that they exaggerated in their protests, acting as if they were some terrible victim of Italian football, which history doesn’t support.\n\n“I find it all fairly normal, but it reminds me of the old stories.”\n\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON – JUNE 20: Cristian Chivu, Head Coach of FC Internazionale Milano attends a press conference ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 match between FC Internazionale Milano and Urawa Red Diamonds at Lumen Field on June 20, 2025 in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Buda Mendes/Getty Images)\n\nCristian Chivu is on course to win the Scudetto in his first managerial season at San Siro.\n\nWith Inter boasting an eight-point lead over second-placed AC Milan, they are in pole position to dethrone Napoli.\n\n“It seems to me that Inter is doing everything necessary,” Marotta claimed.\n\n“The coaching change caused doubts at first. But they disappeared because Chivu is young, talented, and understands the players instantly.\n\n“It’s a strong group, the players have talent, and Inter should be on the right track; let’s not say more.\n\n“It’s hard to compare him to others. Chivu is very serious, more like Mourinho than people might think.\n\n“He pays close attention to details and stays constantly close to the players.\n\n“Having Mourinho as a coach obviously helped him. He has the qualities that make him both recognizable and capable.\n\nAsked whether Inter should take action against Bastoni, Moratti replied: “That depends on the relationship between the coach and the player; we can’t know.\n\n“Clearly, the coach publicly defends the player, but he might also tell him privately, ‘be careful.’\n\n“What would I have done? It depends on the player, when he does it, and how he does it.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJasson Dominguez has heard the chatter.\n\nThe New York Yankees' young outfielder, who doesn't have an obvious path to playing time to begin the 2026 MLB season, spoke with reporters at spring training this weekend. He's not hiding from the reality of his situation.\n\nDominguez acknowledged that he knows what has been said, but also certainly isn't writing himself off.\n\n“Obviously, I hear all of that, but I try not to focus on that,” Domínguez told reporters on Sunday, via MLB.com. “I try not to focus on that, because there is a Spring Training coming and this is baseball.

    "description": "FC Bayern is keen on bringing the young star to Bavaria, which would be scary hours for the rest of Europe.",
    "fullText": "Bayern Munich currently houses the world’s best wing duo in Olicho.\n\nLuis Diaz and Michael Olise are undoubtedly the best wing pairing at the moment, with unstoppable dribbling, an incredible knack for finding teammates in open pockets of space, and a knack for scoring the most spectacular goals. One could make career highlight reels for both players from just the goal contributions this season. That is how they’ve both been playing.\n\nOlise’s 13 goals and 25 (!!) assists and Diaz’s 19 (!!) goals and 15 assists across all competitions this season are staggering enough… however, this still doesn’t paint the full picture. Both players have an insane gravitational pull, easily taking out 2-3 players from the equation in every play, creating loads of space for teammates to run into to fashion goal-scoring opportunities. And now Bayern might be ready to bring in another player with a crazy gravitational influence of his own: Yan Diomande.\n\nAccording to a tweet from Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano), FC Bayern and top Premier League clubs will battle it out for Diomande’s services in the summer. RB Leipzig is “yet to decide on a final price tag, but Bayern are keen, and Vincent Kompany also appreciates Diomande.” He ends the tweet with “Premier League clubs are also very keen,” which could imply that Premier League clubs outside of the usual suspects may also be deeply invested in this story.\n\nIn short, it is probably safe to assume that Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham Hotspur are all interested. Maybe even add Aston Villa and Newcastle in there for good measure.\n\nFlorian Plettenberg of Sky (@Plettigoal) tweeted that “Nothing has changed,” and that, “FC Bayern are still involved, staying in contact with the new management and monitoring the situation closely”. He then confirms that there is, “Nothing advanced yet,” and that “in the end, it will come down to the price,” which is understandable, since Leipzig is probably okay with the sale if they could get a huge chunk of change for the star winger. Ominously, he also adds that “All the top Premier League clubs are heavily involved.”\n\nOne thing is for certain: footballing giants are ready to have a go at one another for Diomande’s services. The player is a true diamond, cutting into defenses and using his flair and finesse to create chances from tight spaces. He would complement the duo of Diaz and Olise beautifully, and while he primarily plays on the left, he’s more than capable of being serviceable on the right, which makes him a fantastic player to add to the wing depth and/or rotation. This could also signal that Bayern is invested in developing Lennart Karl as a number 10, but I digress.\n\nYan is shining bright like a Diomande right now, and the sky is the limit on his trajectory.\n\nHopefully that trajectory involves a successful stint at Bayern Munich.",

    "title": "Travis Hunter Is Still a “Math Changer,” Just Not the Way You Think",
    "description": "Fantasy managers are panicking. National media is speculating. But are they actually watching Jacksonville? We break down Travis Hunter’s snap history, the Jaguars’ roster math, and why the team’s plan has always been fluid. Bottom line: the “primarily CB” report changes far less than people think",
    "fullText": "Fans in Duval and a new wave of national Jaguars followers have been buzzing for the past few days ever since Cam Wolfe of NFL Network reported that Travis Hunter is expected to play primarily cornerback in 2026, with part-time duties at wide receiver. If this new report sounds familiar to some, it probably should. It’s essentially what General Manager James Gladstone told the fanbase back on January 14th at his end-of-season media availability.\n\n“Very fair to say his rehab process is going as expected. He’s hitting it hard and obviously the joy that he brings to just the everyday operation is still something that permeates throughout the space that he enters. Beyond that, on the role that he will play, we still expect him to play on both sides of the ball. Obviously, you can take a peek at expiring contracts on our roster and which side of the ball has more. Obviously at this point walking into the offseason, corner is a position that we have a few guys who are on expiring contracts. So by default you can expect for there to be a higher emphasis on his placement.”\n\nWith everyone high and low itching to make their long-awaited grand declarations on the Jaguars’ plan for Hunter, this feels like an appropriate time to clear a few things up.\n\nHere’s what we actually know. As a rookie, Hunter played 323 offensive snaps and 162 defensive snaps across seven games. That’s roughly 46 snaps per game on offense and 23 on defense. Early on, the plan leaned towards offense as the primary position. Before the bye week, Head Coach Liam Coen publicly talked about self-scouting, asking, “What do we do best?” and pouring into those strengths. At the time (pre-Jakobi Meyers), the offense needed direction. They needed juice. Reports reflected that the team would lean on Hunter to fill that role coming out of the break.\n\nThen the Meyers trade happened. The offense stabilized. The receiving core and the surrounding team adjusted, falling in line at a time that Hunter was sidelined with a season-ending injury. That’s the key: they’ve shown us they’re willing to self-scout, and they adjust. Plans evolve based on roster needs, not draft-day promises. When Hunter was drafted, the front office acknowledged his usage would be fluid early as he learned to play both roles in the league. That fluidity has simply carried into Year Two.\n\nAnd honestly, that’s the whole advantage of having Travis Hunter. He’s what they’ve called a “math changer.” You deploy him where the need is most urgent week to week, matchup to matchup, season to season. Meanwhile, none of this locks them into anything permanent. This was a misconception that Gladstone attempted to clear up in June:\n\n“I do think there’s a little bit of a misconception in that it’s wide receiver first corner second as much as it is the learning methodology of wide receiver through this phase and then continuing to trickle in more defense that is his primary background,” Gladstone said.\n\nThe “wide receiver first” mentality was about his onboarding, not his usage primacy. What I interpret this recent report to indicate is that Hunter’s defensive snap rate is expected to increase, possibly to full-time starter levels, because that’s where the current team need is. What it does not say is that his offensive role is disappearing, nor that this move is permanent moving towards the future. Those are two different things.\n\nBefore his injury in 2025, Hunter was playing between 53% and 87% of offensive snaps in the first seven games. His defensive usage fluctuated wildly, anywhere from 9% to 68%, depending on injuries in the secondary. Remember: Montaric Brown’s usage was ramping up early and didn’t surpass a 45% snap rate until after the Greg Newsome, Tyson Campbell, Week Five trade. When the corner room was thin, Hunter played more defense. When it wasn’t, he didn’t. That’s not confusion. That’s roster management.\n\nNow look at the receiver room. Early in the season, Brian Thomas Jr. typically led the group in snaps. Hunter was usually second. Dyami Brown and Parker Washington rotated for the WR3 role week-by-week, with Tim Patrick handling about 20% of snaps at WR5. Fast forward to how the season ended: with Hunter out, Parker Washington and Jakobi Meyers were often out-snapping BTJ. Dyami had multiple healthy scratches, and Tim Patrick is a pending free agent. Suddenly, WR4 and WR5 snaps widely available, and at the same time, the team has a massive hole at outside CB1.\n\nThere’s roughly 40–50% of 2025 WR snaps from WR4/WR5 roles available. Hunter can absorb a chunk of that while playing much heavier on defense. From a roster construction standpoint, that’s not controversial. It’s practical. And that’s without even factoring in potential draft additions.\n\nIf Parker, Meyers, or BTJ were to miss time in 2026, Hunter’s offensive usage would likely spike. If a major roster move happens at receiver, the plan changes again. That’s the point. Jacksonville is coming off a 13-win season. They finished near the top of the league in post-bye week passing offense with Hunter sidelined. Meanwhile, cornerback help is needed, and Hunter is one of the best young CB talents from his draft class. They have options. That’s a good thing.\n\nThis situation reminds me of last offseason’s Brenton Strange conversations. Many predicted then that he might not put up the gaudy, fantasy-friendly numbers, but he’d be essential to how the machine works. That turned out to be true. Strange was one of the team’s most efficient players and a dominant run blocker, even if the box score didn’t scream it. Hunter might follow a similar path, at least for now, where his combined offensive and defensive statistical output doesn’t come close to matching his on-field impact on wins and losses. And that’s probably just fine for Jacksonville leadership.\n\nIf he plays 30–45% of offensive snaps while logging full-time reps at corner, his fantasy output may dip. But his presence alongside Strange, BTJ, Parker, and Meyers stresses defenses. Coverage shifts. Matchups tilt. The offense benefits even if the stat sheet doesn’t explode. If the team wins, none of that matters. If they struggle early and his offensive usage feels light? Fans will panic. That’s football. But following a 9-win 2025 improvement, they’ve probably earned a full offseason with room to work unquestioned.\n\nOne more factor that should be considered is Hunter’s conditioning. Hunter is expected to be ready for Week 1. But after multiple injuries between training camp and his late-season issue, it’s fair to wonder if he’ll immediately be in peak, two-way-ironman shape. Managing his early workload on offense, where timing and conditioning matter most, might simply be smart development in return from November LCL surgery. That doesn’t mean his ceiling is capped. It may just mean pacing may be wise at this juncture.\n\nAll we truly know is what we already knew in January: Travis Hunter will open the season primarily at cornerback while playing some receiver. That’s it.\n\nEverything else, like the assumption that his offensive role is permanently shrinking, is purely NFL dead zone projection. More than anything, this just feels like offseason noise amplified by fantasy football debates, and a national media cycle that doesn’t consistently track Jacksonville’s week-to-week realities. The plan isn’t rigid. It never was. It’s fluid, just like it’s always been. Welcome to the new era of Jacksonville Jaguars football.",

    "fullText": "Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it will strengthen safeguards on a new artificial intelligence video-making tool, following complaints of copyright theft from entertainment giants.\n\nThe tool, Seedance 2.0, enables users to create realistic videos based on text prompts. However, viral videos shared online appear to show copyrighted characters and celebrity likenesses, raising intellectual property concerns in the U.S.\n\n\"ByteDance respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNBC.\n\n\"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nByteDance's response comes after receiving backlash and stern warnings from Hollywood groups like the Motion Picture Association (MPA), a trade association representing major Hollywood studios including Netflix, Paramount Skydance, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney.\n\nThe group issued a forceful public statement at the end of last week demanding that ByteDance immediately cease what it called \"infringing activity.\"\n\n\"In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,\" said MPA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin in the statement.\n\n\"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.\"\n\nAccording to a report from Axios, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter Friday to ByteDance, accusing the company of distributing and reproducing its intellectual property through the new AI tool without permission.\n\nThe legal notice alleged that ByteDance had effectively pre-packaged Seedance with a pirated library of copyrighted characters, portraying them as if they were public-domain clip art,\" the report added.\n\nDisney has also sent cease-and-desist letters to AI companies in the past. In September, the company warned the AI startup Character.AI to stop the unauthorized use of its copyrighted characters.\n\nWhile trying to protect its intellectual property, Disney has signed a licensing deal with and invested in OpenAI. The agreement allows the AI company to use Disney characters from the Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises in its Sora video generator.\n\nParamount Skydance has also sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, making similar accusations, Variety reported over the weekend.",

    "fullText": "The great thing about the web is that web pages from thirty years ago still work fine.\nSo you can imagine how surprised I was when a new version of Chrome broke my client's web app in production.\n\nThe web app is a data visualization tool with a colourful d3 SVG map.\nHovering over a country brings up a tooltip, and clicking a country brings up a larger panel with data.\nAlthough the application was originally developed in 2013, I took it over in 2022.\n\nI was working on some changes to the web app a couple of weeks ago.\nI run Linux (Arch btw) so I always have the latest version of everything, including Chrome.\nI spun up the development site one day and suddenly the map tooltips and clicking stopped working.\n\nDid I install something new that broke the interactions?\nMaybe one of my Chrome extensions was messing with something?\nI tried rebooting, as one does when they're out of ideas.\nStill didn't work.\n\nI loaded up Firefox.\nEverything worked fine.\nI grabbed my mac and tested it out in Chrome.\nEverything worked fine there too.\nI sent off my changes for the day for my client to review, and they didn't say anything about it being broken.\n\nI could have left it at that, but it didn't sit right with me.\nThat evening I started digging into it more.\n\nFirst thing I did was add console.log statements to the d3 event handlers.\n\nI could see that the mouseenter and mouseleave events were working, but the mousemove and click handlers never fired.\nI tried remove the mouseenter and mouseleave handlers, and suddenly the mousemove and click started working again.\n\nI put back the mouseenter and mouseleave and looked for something that could have been responsible.\nThen I found this suspicious line:\n\nI removed it and it started working again!\nBut that line was written six years ago, before I ever worked on the app.\nWhy would that be to blame?\nWhat changed?\n\nThere's a trope in programming that \"it's never a compiler bug\".\nAs a web developer, we would say \"it's never a browser bug\".\nWell could it be this time?\n\nI was running Chrome v144 so I found the release notes.\nIt came out on January 13th, so the timing made sense.\n\nI scrolled and skimmed and finally found something that sounded like it might be relevant:\n\nAfter an event target is removed from the DOM, the logical target of the pointer, as implied by the Pointer and Mouse boundary events (that is, over, out, enter, and leave events), should be the nearest ancestor still attached to the DOM.\n\nThis led me to find a bug filed for Chromium v144, Regression in Chrome 144: Moving event target in \"mouseenter\" handler breaks click+mouseleave events.\nIt was a Chrome bug!\nThe example code even matched mine almost exactly:\n\nIt seems like this is a permanent change due to a refinement of the spec.\nIt's apparently a feature-not-a-bug, called BoundaryEventDispatchTracksNodeRemoval, so it's probably never going to be fixed.\n\nThere's fortunately a suggestion in a comment of how to fix this on my end though:\n\nMakes total sense!\nI made the change, and everything was working just as it had been a couple of weeks earlier!\n\nI'm going to resist blaming the browser next time I have a bug, but it's very interesting to be reminded that it can and does happen.\n\nThe important takeaway is that when I see something wrong on a client project, I'm not going to be able to rest until I figure out exactly why.\nI needed to be sure it was limited to my computer, because if it wasn't, the last thing I'd want is for my client to find out from one of their users.\n\nI of course pushed the change that night and let my client know what had happened, and that the production site was already being affected.\nFortunately, v144 hadn't been fully rolled out.\nEven as I write this, less than 4% of users are running v144.\nThis also underscores the importance of developers testing using the newest versions.\n\nAs a developer, I always want to fix bugs before my client notices, and definitely before their users notice.",

    "title": "The Speed of Building Has Outpaced the Thinking Part",
    "description": "Explore the impact of AI on indie development and the need for a moral compass in coding. Are we sacrificing quality for speed?",
    "fullText": "I get this feeling a lot lately. I wake up with an idea, grab a coffee, open my editor, and thanks to the current generation of AI tools, I can have a working prototype before breakfast.\n\nThe barrier to entry for software development hasn’t just been lowered; it’s effectively been removed. We are in the era of “vibe coding,” where natural language prompts turn into deployed applications in minutes. It is exhilarating. It is powerful.\n\nBut lately, I have started to wonder: Are we killing indie development with AI?\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I love these tools. I use GitHub Copilot and other LLMs daily. But I believe we have reached a tipping point where the speed of building has outpaced the thinking part. We are so focused on how fast we can build that we stopped asking if we should build.\n\nIn this post, I want to talk about why we need a new “moral compass” for development in the AI age, and a potential solution to help us get there.\n\nFive years ago, if you had an idea for a SaaS tool, say, a screenshot editor or a niche time-tracker,you had to sit down and plan. The friction of coding was a natural filter. You had to ask yourself: “Is this worth X hours of my life?”\n\nToday, that cost is near zero. If you don’t like the screenshot tool you’re paying $15 a year for, you can prompt an AI to build a clone in an afternoon.\n\nOn the surface, this looks like freedom. But look a little deeper. That $15 tool you just cloned? It was likely built by another indie developer. Someone who spent months thinking about edge cases, designing the interface, writing documentation, and supporting users. By cloning it just because you can, you aren’t just saving $15; you are actively devaluing the craft of independent software development and the livelihood of the person behind it.\n\nIf we all just clone everything we use, we completely commoditize the market. We create a sea of “good enough” AI-generated noise where no one can actually sustain a business.\n\nLet me paint a picture that I think a lot of developers are starting to recognize.\n\nYou spend weeks, maybe months, building something. You think about the problem, you design the interface, you handle the edge cases, you support your users, you write the docs. You pour yourself into it. Then one morning, someone sees your product, opens their AI editor, and builds a “good enough” version in an afternoon. They ship it. Maybe they make it free, maybe they make it open source, maybe they just use it themselves and tell their friends, their community, their followers.\n\nThey did not steal your code. They did not copy your product. They just… rebuilt it. Close enough. Good enough. And now your product has competition that cost someone a few hours of prompting while it cost you months of your life.\n\nBut it does not stop there. A third developer sees that clone and thinks, “I can do this too, but I want it slightly different.” So they prompt their own version. And a fourth. And a fifth. Each one is not a copy in the traditional sense. Nobody is violating a license. Nobody is stealing intellectual property. They are just building their own version that matches their use case.\n\nIt is a lot like art. You create a painting, something original, something you are proud of. Then somebody sees it and recreates it. Not a forgery, just their interpretation. But they have a bigger budget, a larger audience, better distribution. Suddenly their version is the one people see first. Others share that version instead of yours. This is what is happening a lot on social media with AI-generated content. The original creator is overshadowed by the faster, more accessible clone.\n\nIn the art world, we have a word for this erosion: it is called devaluation. In the software world, we are doing it at industrial scale, and we are calling it innovation.\n\nI am not saying you should never build something that already exists. Competition is healthy, and sometimes a fresh perspective genuinely improves a category. But there is a difference between thoughtful competition and reflexive duplication. The question every developer should ask themselves is: “If I know someone can clone my work in an afternoon, is it still worth building?”\n\nThe answer, I believe, is yes, but only for the things that cannot be cloned in an afternoon. The deep domain knowledge. The community around your tool. The years of user feedback baked into every feature. The trust you have earned. Those are the things AI cannot reproduce with a prompt, and I definitely don’t want to discourage people from building those things.\n\nBut you can only build those things if you commit to something long enough for them to develop. And that is the real danger of the current moment: not that AI makes building easy, but that it makes abandoning easy. Why invest years in one product when you can ship a new one every week?\n\nI have no room to preach. I am right there in the trenches with you.\n\nWhen I built Front Matter CMS, it was way before the AI boom. I had to think deeply about the problem because the investment of time was massive. I looked at the market, saw a gap in Visual Studio Code, and built it because nothing else existed.\n\nCompare that to recently. I built a set of cycling tools (never released by the way) for myself. Did similar tools exist? Absolutely. Were they better? Definitely. But I wanted to see how far I could get with AI. I treated it as a training exercise. In the end, I started paying for a tool called Join, which does the same thing, because it was better and I could focus on my actual work instead of maintaining a tool that was just “good enough” for me.\n\nI did the same with FrameFit. I investigated the market a little, didn’t see an exact match, and just started building.\n\nThere is a difference between building for education (learning how AI tools work) and releasing products that dilute the hard work of others. My worry is that we are blurring that line. We are shipping our “training exercises” as products, and it is making the ecosystem messy for everyone.\n\nAnd I know this because I have been on both sides of it.\n\nHere is the thing that made me stop and reflect. I have projects on both sides of this line, and they feel completely different.\n\nDemo Time is something I have been building for years. Not weeks, not weekends, years. It started because I was a conference speaker who kept running into the same problem: demos failing on stage. Nobody had built a proper solution inside Visual Studio Code, so I did. Over time, it grew because I kept showing up. I used it at conferences, talked to other speakers, iterated based on real feedback from people doing real presentations at events like Microsoft Ignite, GitHub Universe, and OpenAI DevDays. Today it has over 26,000 installations.\n\nNone of that came from code. The code is open source. Anyone can see it, fork it, or rebuild it. Someone could probably vibe-code a basic version in a weekend. But what they cannot replicate is twelve years of conference speaking that taught me what presenters actually need. You would need that experience, or a big company and budget behind you, to even come close. The relationships with the community, the trust that comes from being the person who shows up, year after year, and keeps making the tool better because you genuinely use it yourself. That is not something you can prompt into existence.\n\nCompare that to FrameFit. I built it, I use it, and it works. But if it disappeared tomorrow, I wouldn’t lose any sleep over it. Demo Time? That is like a child to me. I put my passion into it.\n\nThat contrast taught me something important: AI cannot commoditize the human context around software. Community, trust, domain expertise, showing up consistently over time. These are not features you ship. They are moats you build by caring about something longer than a weekend.\n\nThe developers who will thrive are not the fastest shippers. They are the ones who pair AI speed with human judgment. Who build communities, not just codebases. Who invest in trust, not just features. But that only happens if we slow down enough to think about what we are doing.\n\nWe need to re-introduce friction into our process. Not the old friction of writing boilerplate code. That friction is gone, and good riddance. I am talking about the friction of thinking. The pause that forces you to examine your intentions before you act on them.\n\nBefore AI, “thinking” was mandatory. The cost of building was high enough that it naturally filtered out bad ideas. Now, that filter is gone, and thinking must be a conscious, deliberate choice. When I have an idea now, I am trying to force myself to pause before I open Visual Studio Code or prompt a new agent.\n\nI try to run through these four questions:\n\nThat last one is crucial. If there is an open-source tool that does 80% of what you want, the “old” way was to contribute a Pull Request. The “AI way” often tempts us to just rebuild the whole thing from scratch because it feels faster.\n\nBut “faster” isn’t always “better” for the community. And here is the irony: we could use AI itself for this thinking step. Instead of prompting an LLM to start building, prompt it to research what already exists first. Use AI for the thinking, not just the building.\n\nI don’t expect AI platforms that allow you to vibe code to solve this for us. Their business model is predicated on you writing more code (read: prompts), not less. They want you to spin up new projects constantly. They have no incentive to say, “Hey, wait, this already exists.”\n\nThink about it: when was the last time you saw a developer advocate from one of these platforms demonstrate how to contribute to an existing project instead of building something new from scratch? Their marketing is all about speed, novelty, and the thrill of creation. Not about responsibility.\n\nSo, I started thinking: What if we used AI to stop us from building with AI? You could say that this is a paradox, but I think it is actually a necessary evolution of our responsibility as developers.\n\nI am exploring the idea of a Product Moral Compass Agent.\n\nImagine a mandatory first step in your “vibe coding” workflow. Before you start generating code, you pitch your idea to this agent. It interviews you, not to judge you, but to make sure you are making an informed decision.\n\nThis agent would act as the “thinking partner” we are skipping. It could:\n\nIf you still want to build it after that? Great. Go ahead and start coding. But at least you are making an informed, conscious decision rather than reflexively adding more noise to the world.\n\nI am currently building this agent. The first version is available on GitHub: Product Moral Compass Agent. Yes, I am aware of the irony, I am proposing to build something new to stop people from building new things. But I ran it through my own four questions first, and nothing like it exists yet.\n\nOnce it is ready, I will share it openly so that any developer can use it as part of their workflow. Not as a gatekeeper, but as a guide. A thinking partner that helps you pause, research, and decide before you build.\n\nIn the meantime, here is what you can do right now: the next time you have an idea, spend ten minutes with your favorite AI tool and ask it to find every existing solution first. Check your own bank statements. Are you already paying for a tool that solves this? If so, respect that developer’s work. Look at GitHub. Is there a repo that could use your help instead of your competition?\n\nThe time to learn is right now, but the time to think is also right now.\n\nI want you to keep building. I want you to be prolific. But let’s not let the ease of creation destroy the value of what we create.\n\nI am curious to hear your thoughts. Is this gatekeeping, or is it a necessary evolution of our responsibility as developers? Let me know in the comments below.\n\nIs an AI able to write the contents of your article?

Get ready to pay even more this year.\n\nAccording to Western Digital, one of the world's biggest hard drive manufacturers, the company has already sold out of its storage capacity for 2026 with more than 10 months still left in the year.\n\n\"We're pretty much sold out for calendar 2026,\" said Western Digital CEO Irving Tan on the company's recent quarterly earnings call.\n\nTan shared that most of the storage space has been allocated to its \"top seven customers.\" Three of these companies already have agreements with Western Digital for 2027 and even 2028.\n\nFurthermore, the incentive for these hardware companies to prioritize the average consumer is also dwindling. According to Western Digital, thanks to a surge in demand from its enterprise customers, the consumer market now accounts for just 5 percent of the company's revenue.\n\nAI companies have been eating up computer hardware as industry growth accelerates. Prices for products ranging from computer processors to video game consoles have skyrocketed due to these AI companies cannibalizing supply chains.\n\nThe tech industry has already been experiencing a shortage of memory due to demand from AI companies. PC makers have been forced to raise RAM prices on a near-regular basis as shortages persist. Video game console makers, like Sony, have even reportedly considered pushing the next PlayStation launch beyond the planned 2027 release in hopes that AI-related hardware shortages would be resolved by then.\n\nWith this latest news from Western Digital, it appears the ever-increasing demands from AI companies for memory and storage will continue to grow, with no end in sight. Unless, of course, investors decide to pull back from AI over fears that AI's promises may not come to fruition.

    "title": "The art of the squeal: What we can learn from the flood of AI resignation letters",
    "description": "What we can learn from the flood of \"why I quit\" letters from researchers at Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI.",
    "fullText": "Corporate resignations rarely make news, except at the highest levels. But in the last two years, a spate of X posts, Substack open letters, and public statements from prominent artificial intelligence researchers have created a new literary form — the AI resignation letter — with each addition becoming an event to be mined for meaning. Together, the canon of these letters — some of them apparently bound by non-disclosure agreements and other loyalties, legally compelled or not — tells us a lot about how some of the top people in AI see themselves and the trajectory of their industry. Overall, the image is bleak.\n\nThis past week brought several additions to the annals of \"Why I quit this incredibly valuable company working on bleeding-edge tech\" letters, including from researchers at xAI and an op-ed in The New York Times from a departing OpenAI researcher. Perhaps the most unusual was by Mrinank Sharma, who was put in charge of Anthropic's Safeguards Research Team a year ago, and who announced his departure from what is often considered the more safety-minded of the leading AI startups. He posted a 778-word letter on X that was at times romantic and brooding — he quoted the poets Rainer Maria Rilke and Mary Oliver. Opining on AI safety, his own experiences working on AI sycophancy and \"AI-assisted bioterrorism,\" and the \"poly-crisis\" consuming our society, the letter had three footnotes and some ominous, if vague, warnings.\n\n\"We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences,\" Sharma wrote. \"Throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions.\"\n\nSharma noted that his final project at Anthropic was \"on understanding how Al assistants could make us less human or distort our humanity\" — a nod, perhaps, to the scourge of AI psychosis and other novel harms emerging from people overvaluing their relationships with chatbots. He said that he didn't know what he was going to do next, but expressed a desire to pursue \"a poetry degree and devote myself to the practice of courageous speech.\" The researcher ended by including the full text of \"The Way It Is\" by the poet William Stafford.\n\nIn the annals of AI resignations, Sharma's missive might be less dramatic than the boardroom coup that ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman for five days in November 2023. It's less troubling than some of the other end-of-days warnings published by AI safety researchers who quit their posts believing that their employers weren't doing enough to mitigate the potential harms of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a smarter-than-human intelligence that AI companies are racing to build. (Some AI experts question whether AGI is even achievable or what it might mean.)\n\nBut Sharma's note captures the deep attachments that top AI researchers — who are extremely well-compensated and work together in small teams — feel to their work, their colleagues, and, often, their employers. It also exposes some of the tensions that we see cropping up again and again in these resignation announcements. At top AI labs, there's an intense competition for resources between research/safety teams and people working on consumer-facing AI products. (Few, if any, public resignations seem to come from people on the product side.) There are pressures to ship without proper testing, established safeguards, or knowing what might happen when a system goes rogue. And there's a deep sense of mission and purpose that can sometimes be upended by feelings of betrayal.\n\nMany of the people who have publicly quit AI companies work in safety and \"alignment,\" the field tasked with making sure that AI capabilities align with human needs and welfare. Many of them seem very optimistic about AI, and even AGI, but they worry that financial pressures are eating away at safeguards. Few seem to be giving up on the field entirely — except perhaps Sharma, the aspiring poet. Either they jump ship for another seven-, eight-, or nine-figure job at a competing AI startup, or they become civic-minded AI analysts and researchers at one of a growing number of AI think tanks.\n\nAll of them seem to be worried that either epic gains or epic disasters lie ahead. Announcing his departure from Anthropic to become OpenAI's Head of Preparedness earlier this month, Dylan Scandinaro wrote on LinkedIn, \"AI is advancing rapidly. The potential benefits are great — and so are the risks of extreme and even irrecoverable harm.\" Daniel Kokotajlo, who resigned from OpenAI, said that OpenAI's systems \"could be the best thing that has ever happened to humanity, but it could also be the worst if we don't proceed with care.\"\n\nRecently, xAI, where co-founder Elon Musk is notorious for tinkering with the proverbial dials of the Grok chatbot, has seen a half-dozen members of its founding team leave. But the locus of the AI resignation letter, as a kind of industry artifact, is the red-hot startup OpenAI, where major figures, including top executives and safety-minded researchers, have been leaving for the last two years. Some resigned; some were fired; some were described in the press as \"forced out\" over internal company disputes. Seven left in a short period in the first half of 2024.\n\nWith revenue paling compared to its massive and growing infrastructure costs, OpenAI recently announced that it would begin incorporating ads into ChatGPT. That caused researcher Zoë Hitzig to quit. This week, she published a resignation letter in the Times, warning about the potential implications of ads becoming part of the substrate of chatbot conversations. \"ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candor that has no precedent, in part because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda,\" she wrote. But, she warned, OpenAI seemed prepared to leverage that \"archive of human candor\" — much as Facebook had done — to target ads and undermine user autonomy. In the service of maximizing engagement, consumers might be manipulated — the classic sin of the modern internet.\n\nIf you think you are building a world-changing invention, you need to be able to trust your leadership. That's been a problem at OpenAI. On November 17, 2023, Altman was dramatically fired by the company's board because, it claimed, Altman was \"not consistently candid in his communications with the board.\" Less than a week later, he performed his own boardroom coup and was reinstated, before consolidating his power. The exodus proceeded from there.\n\nOn May 14, 2024, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever announced his resignation. Sutskever was replaced as head of OpenAI's superalignment team by John Schulman, another company co-founder. A few months later, Schulman left OpenAI for Anthropic. Six months later, he announced his move to Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, who had replaced Altman as OpenAI's interim CEO during his brief firing.\n\nThe day after Sutskever left OpenAI, Jan Leike, who also helped head OpenAI's alignment work, announced on X that he had resigned. \"OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity,\" Leike wrote, but the company's \"safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\" He thought that \"OpenAI must become a safety-first AGI company.\" Less than two weeks later, Leike was hired by Anthropic. OpenAI and Antrhopic did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt OpenAI, departing researchers have said that the experts concerned with alignment and safety have often been sidelined, pushed out, or scattered among other teams, leaving researchers with the sense that AI companies are sprinting to build an invention they won't be able to control. \"In short, neither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\" for AGI, wrote Miles Brundage when he resigned from OpenAI's AGI readiness team in 2024. Yet he added that \"working at OpenAI is one of the most impactful things that most people could hope to do\" and did not directly criticize the company. Brundage now runs AVERI, an AI research institute.\n\nAcross the AI industry, the story is much the same. In public pronouncements, top researchers gently chastise or occasionally denounce their employers for pursuing a potentially apocalyptic invention while also emphasizing the necessity of doing that research. Sometimes they offer a \"cryptic warning\" that leaves AI watchers scratching their heads. A few do seem genuinely alarmed at what's happening. When OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler left the company in January 2025, he wrote that he was \"pretty terrified by the pace of AI development\" and wondered if it would wipe out humanity.\n\nYet in the many AI resignation letters, there's little discussion of how AI is being used right now. Data center construction, resource consumption, mass surveillance, ICE deportations, weapons development, automation, labor disruption, the proliferation of slop, a crisis in education — these are the areas where many people see AI affecting their lives, sometimes for the worse, and the industry's pious resignees don't have much to say about it all. Their warnings about some disaster just beyond the horizon become fodder for the tech press — and de facto cover letters for their next industry job — while failing to reach the broader public.\n\n\"Tragedies happen; people get hurt or die; and you suffer and get old,\" wrote William Stafford in the poem that Mrinank Sharma shared. It's a terrible thing, especially the tones of passivity and inevitability — resignation, you might call it. It can feel as if no single act of protest is enough, or, as Stafford writes in the next line: \"Nothing you do can stop time's unfolding.\"\n\nJacob Silverman is a contributing writer for Business Insider.

    "description": "Peter Navarro says the White House may force Big Tech to cover electricity and grid costs tied to AI data centers.",
    "fullText": "The White House is signaling it may force Big Tech to foot the full bill for America's AI boom.\n\nCompanies building data centers \"need to pay for all of the costs,\" and taxpayers should not shoulder the impact of the AI boom.\n\nThe White House has to \"make sure the American people are not hurt,\" he added.\n\nNavarro's comments come as the AI data-center boom faces mounting scrutiny over rising utility bills.\n\nTech giants are pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure to power artificial intelligence. In November, Meta pledged $600 billion to expand AI technology, infrastructure, and its workforce. Apple said in August it would boost its US infrastructure plans by adding another $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion.\n\nAt the same time, energy costs are rising. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate hikes from regulators last year, more than twice the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many power providers have cited surging electricity demand from large-scale data centers as a key reason for seeking higher rates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that households should absorb those increases.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nNavarro also said on Fox News that the US must keep expanding its data center capacity if it wants to remain \"No.1 on the global stage in terms of AI.\"\n\n\"We have to lead China and others on this,\" Navarro said. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful of the impacts across this nation.\"\n\nThe US must stay ahead \"not just for economic reasons but for national security reasons,\" because AI \"will be one of the most dangerous weapons of war,\" he added.\n\nSome AI companies have moved to reassure policymakers that households won't bear the cost of the industry's rapid expansion.\n\nAnthropic said on Thursday that it will cover 100% of the grid upgrade costs associated with its AI data centers.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nThe pledge follows the company's November announcement that it plans to invest $50 billion in AI infrastructure, starting with facilities in Texas and New York.\n\nMicrosoft has taken a similar approach. Last month, the company said it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the electricity costs tied to its data centers and minimize the burden of data center expansion on surrounding communities.",

    "fullText": "MrBeast is YouTube's biggest creator, racking up the most subscribers in the world with over 465 million. On TikTok, he hasn't quite captured the throne and is in third place, with nearly 125 million followers, behind influencers Charli D'Amelio (over 155 million) and Khaby Lame (over 160 million).\n\nThat could be set to change. There's a sign that the content creator, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is doubling down on TikTok in 2026. His company, Beast Industries, is looking to hire a new \"head of TikTok\" this year, according to a recent job posting.\n\nThis new hire will be tasked with \"setting the TikTok strategy\" and \"scaling MrBeast's presence to new levels of creativity and performance\" on the app, per the listing. The TikTok lead will build a small team focused on experimenting with videos, analyzing performance data, and \"ensuring every post feels unmistakably 'Beast.'\"\n\nOne former MrBeast staffer, who reviewed the job listing, told Business Insider that the goal seemed to be finding someone who \"eats, breathes, lives, and fully understands TikTok\" and knows how to pounce on trends.\n\nDonaldson has good reason to invest in TikTok this year. The app now has over 200 million users in the US, where it recently escaped a ban by signing a joint-venture deal. MrBeast's candy and chocolate brand, Feastables, also recently launched on TikTok's e-commerce platform, Shop, selling around 11,000 products to date, according to in-app tallies.\n\nWhile YouTube remains MrBeast's largest media platform, the content creator has been branching out beyond it for years.\n\nHis Instagram account recently crossed 84 million. He has \"Beast Games,\" a popular show on Amazon Prime Video, and licenses his videos to other streaming platforms, such as Tubi. Dubbing his videos into different languages has also helped them spread worldwide and allowed him to post them on non-US platforms like Bilibili in China.",

At an early age, I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life.\"\n\nHarold Hamm, the founder and chairman of the petroleum company Continental Resources, plans to \"adopt\" the state of Oklahoma, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe details of Hamm's planned contributions have not yet been made public, and spokespeople for Continental Resources did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHamm, a billionaire, contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to President Donald Trump's campaign in 2024.\n\nEven Nicki Minaj says she's contributing to Trump Accounts.\n\nMinaj has indicated that the contributions will go to her fans, but it's not clear how much money she's pouring in.\n\nThe New York Post reported in January that it could be \"between $150,000 and $300,000,\" but that the number was still in flux. A representative did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMinaj said on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast that she became interested when she saw President Trump speaking about the accounts alongside Michael Dell.\n\n\"I was just like, wow. Like, I love this idea,\" Minaj said.\n\n\"My big thing is financial literacy,\" she added. \"You could teach a person everything in the world, but if they don't know how to manage money, if they don't know what the financial world really entails, then they'll get it and lose it.\"",

    "title": "Welcome to the United States of Side Hustles",
    "description": "Side hustle culture has exploded in America. Entrepreneurs say its never been easier to start something, but succeeding is another story.",
    "fullText": "For burnt-out 9-to-5ers looking to start something of their own, there's good news and bad news.\n\nThe good news is that it's never been easier to start a side hustle. Unfortunately, that's also the bad news.\n\nThe white-collar job market is tough. Luckily, we live in an era when a stable internet connection and a couple of hundred bucks are all it takes to start your own business. Yet, while side hustles are increasingly seen as a viable path to financial stability — especially given the power of AI — success is far from guaranteed.\n\nIn the latest piece of our \"Future of Capitalism\" series, we explore how hustle culture is changing the way many side hustlers are thinking about and approaching work. Many who spoke with Business Insider say that while starting is relatively easy, making something that lasts is not, and the data shows that the field is crowded.\n\nMichael Satterlee, a teenager from Clifton Park, New York, is an aspirational case. He started his e-commerce company, Cruise Cup, from his childhood home with only about $500.\n\nHis products are all 3D printed, and his top seller — which went viral on Instagram in 2025 — is a can holder that fits two standard 12-ouncers. All he needed to get started was a $300 3D printer and a Shopify account that he maintains for $30 a month.\n\n\"Most of the tools you need are free,\" Satterlee told Business Insider. \"Social media is free. You can get hundreds of millions of views without paying for distribution.\"\n\nBut the low barrier to entry that benefited Satterlee also means stiffer competition.\n\nAccording to a 2025 SurveyMonkey study that sampled 3,573 full-time workers in the US, 37% of respondents have a side hustle, while another 35% are considering pursuing one. Younger workers are pivoting to side gigs harder than any generation, flooding the market.\n\nData from a 2025 Bankrate survey of 2,616 adults shows more than 30% of millennials and Gen Zers said they supplement their incomes with a side job, far outpacing their Gen X, and boomer counterparts. From 2017 to 2025, Bankrate's survey shows that participation in side hustles rose from 19% of US adults to 27% in 2025.\n\nAll told, the data shows that more than 60 million Americans are side hustling in some way.\n\nIt's a crowded field. While the phenomenon may be redefining work and the path to wealth creation, for every success story, there are ample warnings to those thinking about jumping off the corporate ladder.\n\nWhether for a product, a service, or TikTok content, everyone's got an idea. Although it's easier than ever to start something, that hardly guarantees success. And successes that do materialize don't happen overnight, and they can be hard to maintain.\n\nMichela Allocca, a full-time personal finance content creator who began posting on Instagram in 2019, said it took her two years before she started earning consistent income from her content creation business. Now, seven years in, getting started isn't the challenge; it's staying relevant in an increasingly crowded market.\n\n\"There is significantly more competition now,\" Allocca said. \"It has skyrocketed, and there are so many other people making similar templates or similar styles of content.\"\n\nIf you're after longevity, you can never rest, she said. In a market where algorithms shift, platforms evolve, and new creators emerge daily, visibility is fleeting. The same forces that make it easy to start also make it easy to be replaced. To avoid that fate, it's essential to stay up to date with industry trends and be willing to adjust your strategy in real time.\n\nCompetition looks different in every side-hustle segment. While Allocca is going up against a growing number of creators online, entrepreneurs in e-commerce face a different squeeze: the erosion of the middleman.\n\nAlex Yale, a former consultant who now runs two e-commerce brands, said the pandemic-era boom attracted a wave of sellers who sourced products from Chinese factories and resold them under private labels on Amazon. But increasingly, those factories have begun selling directly to consumers.\n\n\"The factories are saying, 'Why am I selling to you and letting you make a profit? I'll just open my own Amazon account and sell directly,'\" said Yale. The result: price compression and copycat competition. If you see success importing a product from China without any patent or IP protection, within months, \"they'll be selling it 20% to 30% cheaper.\"\n\nThe broader message, experts say, is that easier doesn't mean easy.\n\n\"The messaging of, 'It's easier to start a business than find a job right now.' No. I mean, both are hard,\" said Dan Schawbel, the managing partner of Workplace Intelligence, a labor market research firm.\n\nA career was once a decadeslong or even lifelong prospect. Hustle culture is different.\n\nIf the current era of capitalism is abolishing the barriers to entry to start a business, the future of work may be characterized by short stints and constant iteration.\n\nThe low cost of starting up a modern-day business allows prospective entrepreneurs to experiment without incurring much risk, and experimentation may be the key to success in a hyper-competitive environment.\n\n\"You can try different things,\" Matt Barrie, the founder and CEO of freelance marketplace Freelancer.com, told Business Insider. \"Many hustlers don't just have one company; they have four, five, six. Three or four might not work, but that's the nature of hustling.\"\n\nIn essence, starting a business can be approached like any other investment, with diversification the most durable formula for success.\n\nWilliam Butterton is a full-time electrical engineer and serial side-hustler. He started buying and installing ATMs and vending machines with about $2,500 upfront, in order to earn passive income. He told Business Insider that his philosophy is to start wide and then filter down once something starts clicking.\n\nBut Butterton's other pursuits also include flipping Pokémon and sports cards on live-selling platform Whatnot. He says he's going to keep trying new endeavors, as long as he doesn't have to sacrifice his current job security or family time. One day, he aspires to run his own business full-time, but he's in no rush.\n\nIn a crowded landscape, experimentation may get you in the game. Consistency keeps you there.\n\n\"You have to be willing to post a video that gets zero views, then one view, then 100 views — and do that a thousand times,\" Satterlee, the creator of the 3D printed Cruise Cup, said.\n\nAllocca agrees. Most people, she said, underestimate the grind required to break through.\n\n\"If you look at any successful creator in 2026, most of them have been posting multiple times a day, every day, for three or four years,\" she said. \"It only looks like an overnight success from the outside.\"",

    "description": "Three generations of a Maryland family formed a \"family compound.\" Multigenerational living is a growing trend amid the rising cost of living.",
    "fullText": "Lauren McCadney had always wanted to live next door to friends or family. In her late 50s, she finally made that happen, though not the way she'd planned.\n\nIn 2020, Lauren's mother, who had been living with her brother and his family in Frederick, Maryland, died. Lauren, who was going through a difficult divorce and doesn't have children, decided she wanted to be closer to her family and help her brother care for their dad, who was dealing with his own health challenges.\n\nIn 2021, she moved from her home in Chicago to Maryland, renting a house a few blocks away from her brother, James, her sister-in-law, Lorri, and twin 20-year-old nephews, Drew and Carter. In 2023, the five-bedroom house next door to James and Lorri went on the market, and Lauren bought it and moved in with her sister, Cheryl.\n\nNow the seven family members live between the two houses, sharing caregiving responsibilities for James Sr., the family patriarch, and forming what they call a family compound.\n\nMultigenerational living was once the norm in the US. Before World War II, it was almost unheard of for older adults to live independently or to receive care outside their families, while younger people often waited until marriage to move out. That changed for millions of American families as they lived farther apart, independent living services for older people became more accessible, and more women joined the workforce.\n\nNow, as the costs of housing, long-term care for seniors, and childcare soar, that trend is beginning to reverse. The McCadneys are one of a growing number of American families moving back in together — or never separating in the first place. The number of people in the US living in multigenerational households — those with two or more adult generations — quadrupled between 1971 and 2021, according to Pew Research.\n\n\"I feel very blessed and fortunate that we have the situation we have,\" Lauren said, \"because I have friends who are the primary solo caregiver, and that is hard.\"\n\nThe McCadney family splits caregiving duties — and everyone saves money in their arrangement.\n\nLauren, who retired from her career in tech marketing in 2024, renovated her house to suit her family's needs, refinishing the basement into a separate living space for Cheryl and making the first floor accessible for their father, who has a neurological condition that makes walking difficult and affects his memory.\n\nCheryl, who pays below-market rent, takes care of Lauren's dog while she's on vacation. Their brother manages most of their father's personal and medical care, while Cheryl spends a lot of time with him during the day. Lauren likes to take her father, who uses a scooter, to restaurants, breweries, and concerts.\n\nWhen any family member goes on vacation or is otherwise occupied, they know another family member will be there to take care of the elder James.\n\nThey also appreciate the peace of mind that comes from knowing their dad is being cared for by family. Plus, James Sr. wasn't keen on moving into a facility.\n\n\"We know that he's going to get much better care, and from a socialization perspective, from a stimulation perspective, from having a reason to get out of bed perspective,\" Lauren said. \"That's something you cannot put a price on.\"\n\nDrew and Carter, who save on rent by living at home, also chip in, including by helping Lauren. They mow their aunt's lawn, give her rides to the airport, and recently drove her to and from eye surgery.\n\n\"I do love that my boys have lived their formative years in a multigenerational household,\" said Lorri, who's a teacher. \"It is, hopefully, clear to them that love is an action.\"\n\nThere are real challenges with caring for an aging family member. The siblings don't have as much flexibility or privacy as they otherwise would. Cheryl said that before she moved in with Lauren, she \"had grown accustomed to living alone and having flexibility to decide when to or not to interact with others.\" Living with family has changed that.\n\nJames and Lorri are sandwiched between caring for their kids and their parents, all while juggling full-time jobs. Even as the couple is on the precipice of becoming empty-nesters, they're responsible for someone who's ever more dependent on them.\n\n\"I know there are times when James is exhausted and or frustrated,\" Lorri said, \"and as his wife, that's hard to watch.\"\n\nJames, who works for Maryland's Department of Human Services, said there's a constant balance to strike in doing right by all of his family members.\n\n\"Am I taking anything away from my children, or did I take anything away from them?\" he said. \"We hope that we're doing all the right things.\"\n\nThe McCadneys don't know how long they'll stay where they are. Lauren's house requires a lot of maintenance that she'd rather not have to deal with as she ages. Lorri and James hope to someday downsize and spend more time at the beach in their travel trailer. As long as the elder James is living with them, the couple said they'll stay in their home.\n\nLauren doesn't know who will take care of her when she's older. She and her friends talk about buying a piece of land and building several small homes on it, creating their own communal living arrangement where they could share a caregiver and help each other out.\n\n\"A lot of my friends are sitting around right now having this conversation, which is, 'We don't have kids, who's taking care of us? How do we do this?'\" she said.\n\nWhile so much about the future is uncertain, she's taking one day at a time for now.\n\n\"I'm just happy that everything works for right now,\" she said.",

    "description": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei says he's trying to keep Anthropic growing at a 10x pace while holding the line on safety.",
    "fullText": "A familiar tension has come for even the most safety-minded of the AI industry: principles or profit?\n\nOpenAI, the leading AI startup, was founded to build artificial intelligence that benefits all of humanity. Many AI watchers and former employees have questioned its commitment to that mission, however, as it rushes to generate revenue to justify enormous investments in the company.\n\nAnthropic, one of OpenAI's chief rivals, was founded by former OpenAI employees who were concerned about that perceived mission drift. They sought to run an AI company focused on safety above all else.\n\nEven Anthropic, however, struggles to stay on course.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei says his company faces significant pressure to uphold its commitments to mitigating AI's potential risks while still turning a profit.\n\n\"We're under an incredible amount of commercial pressure, and we make it even harder for ourselves because we have all this safety stuff we do that I think we do more than other companies,\" Amodei said on a recent episode of the \"Dwarkesh\" podcast.\n\nLast week, Anthropic, which launched only five years ago, announced $30 billion in Series G funding at a $380 billion post-money valuation, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world.\n\nIn its press release, the company underscored its growing revenue.\n\n\"It has been less than three years since Anthropic earned its first dollar in revenue,\" the company said. \"Today, our run-rate revenue is $14 billion, with this figure growing over 10x annually in each of those past three years.\"\n\nGrowth like that often comes with growing expectations.\n\n\"The pressure to survive economically while also keeping our values is just incredible,\" Amodei said on the podcast. \"We're trying to keep this 10x revenue curve going.\"\n\nAmodei was formerly OpenAI's vice president of research, focusing on safety. He founded Anthropic in 2021 with his sister, Daniela Amodei, and five other former OpenAI staffers, driven by a desire to prioritize safety as AI systems grew increasingly powerful.\n\nAmodei is not the only one who says that Anthropic's mission is hard to sustain as the company grows. Mrinank Sharma, a former safety researcher at Anthropic, said he resigned last week in part due to this tension.\n\n\"Throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions,\" Sharma wrote in his resignation letter, which he shared on X. \"I've seen this within myself, within the organization, where we constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most, and throughout the broader society too.\"\n\nEven at companies that aren't developing foundational AI models, adopting AI responsibly often takes a back seat to the promise of efficiency and increased profits.\n\nResponsible AI use in the workplace is moving \"nowhere near as fast as it should be,\" Tad Roselund, a managing director and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, told Business Insider in 2024.\n\nThe same is true across the venture capital ecosystem.\n\n\"The venture capital environment also reflects a disproportionate focus on AI innovation over AI governance,\" Navrina Singh, the founder and CEO of AI governance platform Credo AI, told Business Insider in 2024. \"To adopt AI at scale and speed responsibly, equal emphasis must be placed on ethical frameworks, infrastructure, and tooling to ensure sustainable and responsible AI integration across all sectors.\"",

    "fullText": "Delivery service Instacart is moving further into new areas, such as advertising and retail tech.\n\nThe company's roughly 600,000 gig workers, who shop and deliver groceries and other retail goods, are its most visible face for many people. But Instacart's business is growing in many directions, CEO Chris Rogers said on a November earnings call.\n\n\"We have the leading online grocery marketplace, a best-in-class suite of enterprise technologies for retailers, and a growing advertising ecosystem,\" Rogers said on the call, his first as CEO after assuming the position in August.\n\nInstacart needs people to make good on its growth plans. The company had about 170 open roles on its careers website as of early February.\n\n\"We're hiring selectively, with priority on roles that support our core marketplace, Instacart Enterprise solutions for retailers globally, and our ads and data platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\n\"We regularly review compensation to ensure it's competitive and aligned with market benchmarks, location, and role,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThat hiring can include some employees from outside the US on H-1B work visas.\n\nBusiness Insider analyzed 157 H-1B visa applications submitted by Instacart and certified by the Department of Labor in the year ending September 30, 2025. These applications provide insight into how much employees in certain roles make. Many of the salaries were for tech roles, including data science, engineering, and product management positions.\n\nThe Trump administration has initiated changes to the H-1B visa system. In September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider. However, these changes were largely initiated after this reporting period.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which Instacart has disclosed salaries in the work visa data.\n\nData Scientist: $125,000 to $210,000\n\nDirector of Engineering, Machine Learning: $320,000 to $380,000\n\nEngineering Manager, Software: $220,000 to $290,000\n\nManager, Machine Learning Engineering: $260,000 to $280,000\n\nPrincipal Software Engineer: $350,000 to $380,000\n\nSenior Computer Vision/AI Engineer: $180,000 to $290,000\n\nSenior Data Scientist: $170,000 to $265,000\n\nSenior Engagement Manager: $235,000 to $285,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager, Software: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $185,000 to $300,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $190,000 to $298,000\n\nSenior Product Manager: $185,000 to $280,000\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $176,000 to $285,000\n\nSoftware Engineer: $165,000 to $215,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $250,000 to $310,000\n\nHave a tip?

The Ironman Group is the largest operator of global participation sports events, including the Ironman Triathlon Series, City2Surf, and the Epic Series mountain bike races. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've had a pretty eclectic path, but there's a singular throughline of purpose that runs through it. I love creating experiences that transform people's lives for the better.\n\nI went into private equity, investment banking, and consulting after college. I developed a passion for the role business can play in society. Education, though, changed my life, so I took a big step back and said, \"If I want to live a life of purpose, how might I do that?\"\n\nA business school professor sounded like a pretty big gig. I joined the University of Michigan's faculty in 2007. Ultimately, I was on faculty for 14 years and served as dean of the business school at Michigan.\n\nDuring that time, I joined the Equinox board as one of three independent directors. I fell in love with the brand, the team, the community, and really saw a sense of purpose behind it. It's really about unlocking and maximizing people's potential in life through health and fitness.\n\nWhen the pandemic happened, the board asked if I would join full-time and serve as president. We did a lot of great work, and I'm really proud of the team and what we built there. Then, Ironman called and asked if I would serve as CEO. We get to make people's dreams come true, so it's the same purpose, just a different vehicle.\n\nWe're headquartered in Tampa, Florida, but my wife and I also have a place in Park City, Utah.\n\nI care deeply about my sleep, so I aim for about 8 hours a night and wake up between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. We're a global business, so some mornings I need to start early because we have teams in different time zones.\n\nDepending on the day, I'll either train in the morning or in the evening.\n\nFor the last 17 years — usually once a year — I would climb a really big mountain. If I'm training for a mountain, it's a lot of running and lifting weights. I typically live in flat areas except for Utah, so I spend a lot of time on the StairMaster with my weighted pack. Last year, I finally finished the Seven Summits Quest, which is climbing the tallest mountain on each continent.\n\nIf I'm training for a trail run in the mountains, I try to get out there as much as possible. If I'm in Florida, I just run long distances. If I'm training for a triathlon, then it's swim, bike, and run.\n\nI usually sit down every weekend and map out when I want to train vis-à-vis my work schedule that week.\n\nI usually have a Kashi cereal, a yogurt, and some fruit for breakfast. I'm not a big caffeine guy. I love the smell, don't like the taste.\n\nI'm usually at the office by 7:30 in the morning. I tend to drive when I'm in Tampa since it's more of a commuter city. In Park City, I keep a small office I can either drive to or walk to.\n\nSometimes an early morning meeting is inevitable, but I like to sit down for about an hour to map out the two or three things I need to achieve to make it a great day. There's going to be a lot that happens during the day, but for me, I try to be very intentional.\n\nIf you jump into every urgent matter, you'll never actually focus on what's important, and your team will come to expect you to engage in every matter.\n\nThat's not healthy for me in my role or for them. In many, if not most, cases, they're better equipped to handle that matter than I am because I don't have the experience in the specific domain. My job is to create an environment and empower them to be successful.\n\nI have a lot of meetings during the day.\n\nIt really depends on the day, and the stakeholders are varied, but they're not always your traditional meetings. This week, we're at the Iron Man World Championship in Hawaii.\n\nWe organized a run for some of the partners, spouses, and coaches of some of our professional athletes this morning. Basically, a group of friends got together and went for a run. That's not a traditional meeting, but I learned a lot and gathered some good feedback on what we're doing well, so we can keep doing more of that and identify where we can continue to improve.\n\nTypically, I have a sandwich for lunch — nothing too fancy. My favorite sandwich in the world is the Crazy Chicken at the Clockwork Cafe in Park City, Utah.\n\nIf I'm training for something specific, I'll supplement my diet with a smoothie and other supplements to get additional nutrients.\n\nWe're in the live events business. There's always a surprise, and that surprise can come in many different forms. You come to expect the unexpected.\n\nBut we have an incredible team with tremendous experience.\n\nI have a lot of trust in our team because they're the best in the business and can adapt to address issues that come up. Frankly, I don't get thrown off balance that much because our team is so talented, committed, and capable of handling matters as they come up.\n\nUsually, I'll leave around 7 p.m. if it's a day in the office. If it's an event day, we can start at 4 a.m. and go to bed around 2 a.m. the next day.\n\nFor dinner, my wife and I love to cook out, and fortunately, we live in places where we can do so for most of the year. Typically, some good chicken, rice, and vegetables on the grill is always a good one for us.\n\nIf I'm training that evening, I'll run, and my wife will ride her bike next to me. That's our quality time. We also have two chocolate labs, so we'll play with them in the backyard or take them for a walk.\n\nLater, we'll watch television. We've got a few shows that we like together, typically in the realm of comedy. One of our favorite shows we binged together was \"Schitt's Creek.\" I had never actually watched \"Friends,\" which mortified my wife, so we binged that for a while. We like shows that bring a smile to our faces and give us a little bit of humor to end the day.\n\nWe're usually in bed by 9:30 p.m. or so. I'm asleep by 10.",

    "description": "Pokémon cards, valued for their rarity and condition, are attracting collectors, gamers, and investors seeking profit.",
    "fullText": "That Pokémon pack you bought from Walmart could be hiding a holy grail.\n\nMost Pokémon card enthusiasts fall into one of three categories: collectors who love the franchise, gamers who play the trading card game, and investors who want to make money.\n\nNo matter which category you fall into, there are certain types of cards that all Pokémon lovers recognize as top of the line, JJ Hendricks, cofounder of collectible price tracking site PriceCharting, told Business Insider.\n\nCollectible card games are gaining popularity among younger generations. They were the most-purchased secondhand product category for Gen Z in the US on eBay last year. Comparing prices while shopping for cards on eBay can be a good way to learn the value of what you're looking for, but you could still end up paying more than the retail price, Hendricks said.\n\n\"The prices on a lot of items have increased a lot,\" he said. \"There are lots of cards that have doubled or tripled in price in the last few years.\"\n\nMany factors come into play when pricing cards for resale. There are organizations that specialize in grading the condition of cards, and a card's rarity affects how much it could sell for secondhand.\n\nHendricks broke down his top three tips for how to know if you're holding onto a card worth more than you'd think.\n\nFor the trained eye, there are telltale signs of what makes a Pokémon card valuable. One of those markers is the card number, which indicates the card's position among the total cards in a set. The main thing to look for here is whether the card's number is higher than the total number of cards in the set. That indicates a \"secret rare\" card, which can be very valuable.\n\nThose cards are \"much harder to find,\" Hendricks said.\n\nThe Charizard card pictured above is numbered 39/165, meaning it's the 39th card in a set of 165 total cards made. If the number was higher than 165, that would indicate a secret rare card.\n\nDepending on the condition, secret rare cards can sell for $20 or more than $200 each.\n\nNext to the card number are symbols — typically, stars, circles, or diamonds — that also indicate how common your card is. A star represents a rare card, a diamond is uncommon, and a circle is common.\n\nIn the Charizard card above, the star symbol next to the card number suggests that it's rare.\n\nMany people who collect recreationally do so for the artwork on the card. These unique illustrations, which often make up the whole card, can have a special place in a collector's hoard, Hendricks said.\n\nDon't let the glitz fool you, though. Reverse holographic cards, those with a shiny rainbow effect along the art's border, may look cool, but that doesn't always add value, Hendricks said.\n\n\"There are all sorts of different ways they have to add different kinds of effects and different designs to the cards,\" Hendricks said. \"Most of that doesn't really add too much value, versus the ones that are rare and hard to find.\"\n\nStill, some special card designs can be very valuable, like the Van Gogh-inspired Pikachu, which was discontinued in 2023 by an Amsterdam art museum amid the frenzy it sparked among fans. Those Van Gogh Pikachu cards are listed on eBay for up to thousands of dollars in mint condition.\n\nIf you're dusting off your parents' old binder of Pokémon cards, you could have a trove of valuable cards on your hands. The first English cards were officially released in 1999 and feature a stamp indicating their edition.\n\nThey can be pricier on the resale market because they were printed in more limited quantities than later editions, making them harder to find. They need to be in good condition to hold their value, which is typically scored on a scale from one to 10, 10 being mint condition.\n\nOlder cards can cost a few dollars, or they can cost more than a house. In 2022, for example, a \"1999 Pokémon Base Set Shadowless 1st Edition Holo Charizard\" sold for $420,000 at auction.",

    "fullText": "If you're looking for a place to hide out in the stock market as AI continues to disrupt industry after industry, JPMorgan Asset Management says to look to the quality factor.\n\n\"Quality\" in this case isn't a general term of approval. Quality stocks are those with strong and consistent cash flow and earnings, experienced management teams, and competitive advantages.\n\nIt may sound like an obvious place to be at all times, not just when things are volatile. But the factor has lagged the broader market over the last year and beyond as investors have piled into more speculative stocks.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan data, quality is in one of its worst stretches in almost two decades. Here's the performance of the MSCI World Quality Index relative to the MSCI World Index.\n\nHere's a year-by-year look at the performance. Quality stocks underperformed their counterparts by almost 5% in 2025.\n\nRough patches like this have, in the past, tended to bode well for future performance, the bank said.\n\n\"Periods of quality underperformance can be followed by sharp reversals,\" Meera Pandit, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a February 4 report.\n\nWhat's more, if the broader market were to plummet, investors are likely flock to the quality factor, the report said.\n\n\"The period from 2003 to 2008 provides a prime example. Higher-quality companies lagged broader developed markets for four consecutive years from 2003 to 2006, in the run-up to the global financial crisis,\" Pandit said. \"But as the cycle matured and the global economy eventually entered recession, higher-quality fundamentals returned to the fore, with quality stocks outperforming by 7 percentage points in both 2007 and 2008.\"\n\n\"Developed market stocks have seen nine drawdowns of 10% or more over the last 30 years,\" the report continued. \"During these periods, quality stocks have outperformed 78% of the time, with a median excess return of 3.4 percentage points.\"\n\nExamples of broader quality factor funds include the iShares MSCI Global Quality Factor ETF (AQLT) and the Vanguard US Quality Factor ETF (VFQY).\n\nBut for investors who do decide to lean into quality stocks, Pandit said to be conscious of those with a high weighting in AI stocks, as the theme could lead the next market drawdown.\n\nOne example of a quality fund that appears to have limited exposure to AI hyperscalers and software stocks among its top holdings is the Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (SPHQ). It's largest 10 holdings include: Costco, Visa, Mastercard, GE, Apple, Procter & Gamble, Lam Research, Coca-Cola, Caterpillar and Merck.",

    "title": "The career rise of OpenAI's billionaire CEO, Sam Altman",
    "description": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman helped usher in the AI age. Now, he's doing everything he can to keep OpenAI ahead.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI Sam Altman thinks he can see the future better than some people.\n\n\"I think I am unusually good at projecting multiple things— years or a couple of decades into the future—and understanding how those are going to interact together,\" Altman told Forbes in February.\n\nWhat is clear is that in 2026 and beyond, OpenAI and Altman have a lot riding on his vision.\n\nIn 2022, Altman oversaw the release of ChatGPT, kicking off what Bill Gates called \"the age of AI.\" Just over three years removed from the moment, Altman's rivals are applying the pressure like never before.\n\nRivals, like Elon Musk and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, continue to taunt him through the struggles.\n\nAll the while, Altman has spun OpenAI from a research lab into a major company, even boasting a social media play. And he still has yet to reveal whatever mysterious device he's cooking up with Jony Ive, Apple's former design chief.\n\nIf the past is any indication, Altman is tough to bet against.\n\nIn just under a decade, he went from being part of the first Y-Combinator batch to leading the famed startup incubator. A billionaire before he turned 40, the entrepreneur is no longer just a beacon of Silicon Valley. Altman is now a co-Time Person of the Year and a frequent guest of world leaders.\n\nHere's a look at Altman's life and career so far.\n\nAltman grew up in St. Louis and he was a computer whiz from a young age.\n\nHe learned how to program and take apart a Macintosh computer when he was 8 years old, according to The New Yorker. He attended John Burroughs School, a private, nonsectarian college-preparatory school in St. Louis.\n\nAltman has said that having a Mac helped him with his sexuality. He came out as gay after a Christian group boycotted an assembly at his school that was about sexuality.\n\n\"Growing up gay in the Midwest in the two-thousands was not the most awesome thing,\" he told The New Yorker in 2016. \"And finding AOL chat rooms was transformative. Secrets are bad when you're eleven or twelve.\"\n\nAltman studied computer science at Stanford University before dropping out to start an app. The app, which became Loopt, was part of the first group of companies at startup accelerator Y Combinator.\n\nLoopt eventually reached a $175 million valuation. The $43 million sale price was close to how much it had raised from investors, The Wall Street Journal reported. The company was acquired by Green Dot, a banking company known for prepaid cards.\n\nIn 2014, at the age of 28, Altman was chosen by Y Combinator founder Paul Graham to succeed him as president of the startup accelerator.\n\nWhile he was YC president, Altman taught a lecture series at Stanford called \"How to Start a Startup.\" The next year, at 29, Altman was featured on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for venture capital.\n\nIn 2015, Altman cofounded OpenAI with Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. Their goal for the nonprofit artificial intelligence company was to make sure AI doesn't wipe out humans.\n\nSome of Silicon Valley's most prominent names pledged $1 billion to OpenAI, including Reid Hoffman, the cofounder of LinkedIn, and Thiel. Altman stepped down as YC president in March 2019 to focus on OpenAI.\n\nAltman and OpenAI's now-former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, said the move to focus on large language models was the best way for the company to reach artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a system that has broad human-level cognitive abilities.\n\nOpenAI received a $1 billion investment from Microsoft in 2019, the beginning of a major partnership for both companies.\n\nUnder Altman's early tenure, OpenAI released popular generative AI tools to the public, including DALL-E and ChatGPT.\n\nBoth DALL-E and ChatGPT are known as \"generative\" AI, meaning the bot creates its own artwork and text based on information it is fed.\n\nAfter ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022, Altman tweeted that it had reached over 1 million users in five days. As of early 2026, ChatGPT is up to 300 million weekly active users.\n\nOpenAI built on ChatGPT's public launch with a series of major announcements throughout 2023, including the release of GPT-4, an extension of their partnership with Microsoft, and the announcement of ChatGPT Plus (a subscription tier).\n\nIn November, OpenAI's board of directors announced the biggest news: Altman was out as CEO and leaving the board \"effectively immediately.\" The board said Altman was being removed because he \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board.\"\n\nSutskever has expressed remorse for his participation in Altman's removal. Sutskever and three other members did not return to the reconfigured board when Altman was reinstated.\n\nAltman, like many other tech CEOs, was front and center for President Donald Trump's return to power on January 20, 2025. A day after Trump's inauguration, Altman joined Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, and Trump to announce a partnership to fund a $500 billion investment in US AI. The companies would form Stargate, a project that seeks to build US AI infrastructure and create jobs.\n\nIn February 2024, Musk made a $97.4 billion offer to take over OpenAI. Altman declined the offer from his one-time collaborator. Within weeks, Musk, who launched his own competing AI company, xAI, in July 2023, sued OpenAI, Altman, and other senior executives over OpenAI's move away from its original, non-profit mission.\n\nAltman's relationship with Musk has become increasingly tense over the years. As of February 2026, a trial is set to begin in April. In the interim, Musk and Altman have continued to trade barbs, including when OpenAI's CEO said that getting Musk under oath would be \"Christmas in April.\"\n\nSince his return, Altman has overseen a sweeping expansion of OpenAI's ambitions.\n\nIn October 2025, OpenAI completed its restructuring, spinning off its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation. Microsoft retains a 27% stake in the for-profit venture, but the announcement formalized a shift in the relationship between the two companies.\n\nAltman has softened on some of his views as OpenAI seeks revenue, most notably by introducing ads to lower tiers of ChatGPT. In May 2024, Altman called ads \"a last resort for us as a business model.\"\n\nIn 2025 alone, OpenAI launched Atlas, its entry into the browser wars and Sora, its TikTok-esque AI video generation app. In May, Altman announced that he had been working with Ive on an AI-powered consumer device. OpenAI is also making waves in the payment space and is exploring making its own advanced chips.\n\nAltman also brought on former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo to serve as CEO of Applications.\n\nAll of this explains why Altman was one of eight architects of AI to be crowned as Time Magazine's 2025 Person of the Year.\n\nDespite Altman's status as CEO, he holds no equity in OpenAI — a status he has said he wished he had changed \"a long time ago.\"\n\n\"i think it would have led to far fewer conspiracy theories; people seem very able to understand 'ok that dude is doing it because he wants more money' but less so \"he just thinks technology is cool and he likes having some ability to influence the evolution of technology and society,\" Altman wrote on X in October 2025 in reply to a user who questioned what his motivations were if he doesn't stand to immediately profit of OpenAI goes public.\n\nInstead, Altman owes his billionaire status to his investments, namely in Stripe, Reddit, and Helion, a nuclear fusion firm.\n\nAfter Loopt, Altman founded a venture fund called Hydrazine Capital and raised $21 million, which included a large investment from venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Altman invested 75% of that money into YC companies and led Reddit's Series B fundraising round.\n\nAlong with his brothers Max and Jack, Altman launched a fund in 2020 called Apollo that is focused on funding \"moonshot\" companies. They're startups that are financially risky but could potentially pay off with a breakthrough development.\n\nIn 2021, Altman and cofounders Alex Blania and Max Novendstern launched a global cryptocurrency project called Worldcoin.\n\nAltman has said that his investment strategy is to look for \"somewhat broken companies.\"\n\n\"You can treat the warts on top, and because of the warts, the company will be hugely underpriced,\" he told The New Yorker in 2016.\n\nAltman married his partner, Oliver Mulherin, in January 2024. His husband is an Australian software engineer who previously worked at Meta, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nA few weeks after Forbes declared Altman a billionaire, he and Mulherin signed the Giving Pledge, vowing to give away most of their fortune.\n\nIn February 2025, Altman announced the birth of his son on social media.\n\n\"i have never felt such love,\" Altman said in his post.\n\nwelcome to the world, little guy!\n\nhe came early and is going to be in the nicu for awhile. he is doing well and it’s really nice to be in a little bubble taking care of him.\n\ni have never felt such love. pic.twitter.com/wFF2FkKiMU\n\nHe and his husband are expecting their second child later this year.\n\nAltman has found interesting — and expensive — ways to spend his free time.\n\nIn April 2024 (the same month he made Forbes' billionaire list), he was spotted in Napa, California, driving an ultra-rare Swedish supercar. The Koenigsegg Regera is seriously fast, able to go from zero to 250 miles per hour in less than 30 seconds. Only 80 of these cars are known to exist, and they can cost up to $4.65 million.\n\nHe once told two YC founders that he likes racing cars and had five, including two McLarens and an old Tesla, according to The New Yorker. He's said he likes racing cars and renting planes to fly all over California.\n\nSeparately, he told the founders of the startup Shypmate that, \"I prep for survival,\" and warned of either a \"lethal synthetic virus,\" AI attacking humans, or nuclear war. Altman is not alone in prepping for a potential doomsday.\n\n\"I try not to think about it too much,\" Altman told the founders in 2016. \"But I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.\"",

    "title": "I captained a Saudi billionaire's superyacht. Now I'm building a members-only club at sea.",
    "description": "Matthias Bosse is launching the Maybach Ocean Club, bringing together exclusive clubs and luxury superyachts.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Matthias Bosse, a former superyacht captain. It's been edited for length and clarity. Bosse is now the cofounder of the Maybach Ocean Club, a private-membership yacht.\n\nI've done everything there is in the shipping industry. I started with cargo ships. Next was the cruise industry. Then I entered yachting.\n\nIn the shipping world, yachting is the most complex thing you can do, and also potentially the most rewarding. I always enjoyed being on a ship and being part of that community. When you leave port, the ship becomes your little world. I'm hoping to recreate this in my next venture.\n\nIn 1991, I got my first yachting job on the mother of all superyachts, Lady Moura. Eventually, I became captain.\n\nLady Moura was owned by a Saudi billionaire family for 30 years.\n\nIt was a family boat and not about parties. We were mainly in our home port in Monaco, and it was pretty quiet. The owners had their routine: go to a café, read a book, watch TV. There were 60 or 70 crew members, and we had a dedicated chef for them as well as the owners.\n\nThe owner was on board the whole year, and when he was, I had to be on board. That can make maintaining a private life quite difficult, but my family was never far away, and the owner allowed them to come and stay on board. My son learned to walk on the yacht.\n\nOnce a year, we went to Sardinia, and Maddalena Island was one of my favorite spots: the air, the smell, the atmosphere, the landscape. It was so different from Monaco.\n\nDiscretion is one of the most important virtues in this industry, so I can't say much. There are good owners and bad owners. At the end of the day, yacht owners are people; they have the same issues you may be struggling with, whether that's problems in business or family, whatever it is.\n\nThe captain has to maintain a sense of calm. If a captain gets nervous and shows it, people recognize it. There have been tight moments, but you have to show you are in control.\n\nIn 2021, when Lady Moura was sold, I closed that chapter.\n\nI started thinking about about forming a community at sea, which has become the Maybach Ocean Club — a private members club where every member is a shareholder and gets four weeks on board a year.\n\nBecause owners have a usage limit, members won't want to waste it. I've seen so many underutilized yachts that owners only use for a few months a year.\n\nIt'll be the perfect place to meet people, too\n\nDuring the pandemic, we conducted a few test cruises aboard Lady Moura with 14 couples to prove the concept. After a week, people who didn't know each other became friends and formed a community. It's not about going from point A to B to C — that's what cruise ships do. There will be lots of laughter, fun, activities, great food, and water sports.\n\nWe were overwhelmed by the level of interest in becoming members among those who tested it out. We will have a maximum of 300 members. They will pay a buy-in fee in the low seven-digits, followed by an annual fee of about 4% of the buy-in.\n\nWe are now building a new yacht with Mercedes-Maybach. It will be 155 meters long, have 30 identical suites and an 85-person crew, huge spa areas, and a gym. We will have tenders, inflatable toys, and Jet Skis. No private yacht could offer all of this on a consistent level.\n\nWe hope to launch in 2029. We plan to start by yachting in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean and attend events like Formula 1 races, the Cannes Film Festival, and New Year's Eve in St. Bart's. But if the majority of members decide to do the Indian Ocean instead of the Caribbean one winter, we have that flexibility. Same with chefs — we expect to have several, but if our members want something specific, they can decide.\n\nI'm working on becoming a member myself. I don't think I'll have any problem leaning back and doing nothing. And I can have a glass of rosé, which I was not able to do in my previous position.",

    "description": "An AI gamification manager shares how she went from a contract executive assistant at Microsoft to an AI gamification product manager.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brit Morenus, a 37-year-old senior AI gamification program manager, based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Her identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been at Microsoft for a total of 13 years, but for five and a half, I was a contract worker.\n\nI graduated from college with a degree focused on English, communications, and marketing. I first landed a job at Microsoft as a contract executive assistant. I stayed in that role for about eight months, then joined the marketing team.\n\nEventually, I had the opportunity to take a really special position, but it required knowing gamification. Gamification is about integrating game mechanics and motivators, such as storytelling and reward systems, into learning. So I was going to teach people about our products and sell them in a gamified way.\n\nI spent about a year getting certifications that taught me about gamification. I upskilled and learned how to create games, what game mechanics are, and what motivates someone when they're learning.\n\nThat was the position where I was able to prove my impact, and they decided to bring me on full-time. I stayed in that role for another six years, training the frontline and customer service support to develop the right sales skills.\n\nEventually, I had the opportunity to start gamifying learning about AI. They wanted someone with gamification skills, and my certifications and experience made me the ideal candidate.\n\nI didn't know much about AI yet, aside from using it for personal reasons, but transitioning to an AI role was actually faster than pivoting to gamification. Since I held the gamification role for about six years, I became really good at it. It only took about three months for me to upskill in AI.\n\nIn my first three months on the team, I made myself knowledgeable about AI to the point where I could teach others about it. That's when I got a certification in Azure AI Fundamentals. It was a certification specific to how Microsoft's AI works.\n\nI helped my entire team get it, and then I helped my entire organization start working on it. Then I helped the greater customer service support organization work toward getting it as well.\n\nMy advice to those who want to transition would be: Don't let fear keep you from stepping outside your comfort zone. There's so much ambiguity about changing roles or companies, but there's no time like the present.\n\nWith AI specifically, you just need to learn. Everyone already uses it, but you need to understand how it works, because that's how you can understand what to do with it.\n\nIt's also important to upskill yourself. You have to be willing to constantly move and learn more, because it's going to keep changing — and faster than you can grasp it. Sometimes AI makes wrong predictions, but it is using words to make that prediction. So I absolutely need to use my English degree in order to figure out keywords and how to prompt it to do the right thing.\n\nUp until this Al role, I always joked that I wasn't using my English degree. But now I use it everywhere, and it truly does help. It helps with things like talking to executives and also with the role itself.\n\nIt's important to know the language of AI and how it operates. So now, more than ever, I am using every bit of my English degree and understanding English, grammar, and how it all functions.\n\nFor example, there's a tagging process that happens behind the scenes with AI, just like on social media. Looking at an image, it might tag it as a woman, or a supermarket, and that gives it a confidence score and tells you if it's relevant or not, and if it's what we're looking for.\n\nA lot of it is more about understanding how to apply the English language than about AI — so, thanks, Mom and Dad, I am using the degree you paid for.\n\nThis is part of an ongoing series about workers who transitioned into AI roles. Did you pivot to AI? We want to hear from you. Reach out to the reporter via email at aaltchek@insider.com or secure-messaging platform Signal at aalt.19.",

    "title": "'Big Short' investor Michael Burry was an enigma. Now he's an open book.",
    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has shifted from virtual silence to answering questions about his personal and professional life on Substack.",
    "fullText": "\"You have a very nice haircut. Did you cut it yourself?\"\n\nMichael Burry, played by Christian Bale, earnestly poses that question to a bewildered analyst in the movie \"The Big Short,\" which chronicles the investor's massive bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble.\n\nThe memorable scene is based on a misguided comment the real-life Burry once made, which he revealed in a comment on his Substack.\n\n\"That is a riff on something similar when I complimented a woman on her dress and asked if it was homemade,\" Burry wrote. \"The pained look was similar.\"\n\nSharing a personal anecdote like that marks a sea change for Burry. Until recently, he was one of finance's most enigmatic figures, known for posting cryptic warnings on X, then deleting them, and vanishing from social media for months or years at a time.\n\nThat changed in November, when Burry closed his hedge fund to outside cash and reinvented himself as a newsletter writer. His posts diagnosing an AI bubble and explaining his bets against Nvidia and Palantir have drawn plenty of attention. But his detailed answers to dozens of questions on myriad topics have largely gone unnoticed.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through the comment sections and discussion threads on Burry's Substack to read all of his responses to subscribers as of Friday last week.\n\nThey offered wide-ranging, unprecedented insights into the personal and professional life of a renowned yet mysterious investor.\n\nElite investors tend to keep a low profile. Even the newly retired Warren Buffett only communicated with Berkshire Hathaway shareholders a handful of times a year.\n\nBurry has broken that mold, shifting from virtual silence as a fund manager to pretty much running a 24/7 \"Ask Me Anything.\"\n\nHe's freely shared his thoughts on the day's headlines and latest market moves.\n\n\"I think there is no doubt a SpaceX-X merger — and even an xAI merger — would be accretive to shareholder value for Tesla,\" he recently wrote. \"However, share value is different than share price.\"\n\n\"It does seem to me that Trump's kryptonite is the American stock market,\" reads another of his comments. \"Nothing else touches him.\"\n\n\"In my view, there are no bigger shoes to fill than Warren's,\" he wrote on another occasion. \"I do not believe anyone can fill them, especially at Berkshire.\"\n\nBurry has also spilled the beans on the contents of his portfolio, down to what stock he bought on a particular day and the average price he paid.\n\nMoreover, he's pulled back the curtain on how he approaches investing. He's discussed earnings calls, analyzed stock charts, held forth on human psychology, and outlined his macroeconomic views in comments and messages to subscribers.\n\nBurry has delved into subjects as esoteric as the dynamics of health insurance marketplaces. He's also shed light on his daily habits and interests, often with humor and humility.\n\n\"Young people sometimes don't know how playful and goofy us older guys are,\" he recently wrote.\n\nWhen a reader queried if he'd consider starring in a documentary, Burry quipped: \"Me sitting in front of a computer in my shorts? Or sitting in a chair reading? Doesn't sound too compelling.\"\n\nAsked how he felt on a scale of 1-10, Burry replied: \"I am pretty much a 5 all the time. My wife can attest. My 54-year-old face is not etched by many smiles.\"\n\nResponding to a follow-up question about how he felt when his \"Big Short\" initially went south, he wrote: \"That manifested in my gut. Not fun. I was headed to surgery. Then the trade worked out and I was cured.\"\n\n\"Sir you need sleep,\" one thoughtful subscriber wrote. \"Thank you. I got four hours in,\" Burry replied.\n\nOnce a closed book, the investor has revealed that he's reading \"The Sun Eater\" book series by sci-fi writer Christopher Ruocchio, had a \"heck of a time\" at an Aerosmith concert in the '80s, played Pokémon with his kids, and titled one post after a heavy-metal song called \"The Jig Is Up\" by Ice Nine Kills.\n\nHe's also disclosed some of his favorite investments. He wrote that he's been holding gold and silver for more than 20 years now, and snaps up Samsung Electronics stock every time it gets cheap — a strategy that has \"worked spectacularly several times\" in the past two decades.\n\nBurry, whose Substack is titled \"Cassandra Unchained,\" has also lived up to his reputation for doom-and-gloom predictions.\n\n\"But before a couple of years pass, I see a 100 car wreck that will hurt a lot of AI bulls,\" he wrote, underlining his concern about where the market is headed.",

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood doesn’t give up on her favorite stocks easily.\n\nThe head of Ark Investment Management actively manages her tech holdings, and her timing often links to market movements.\n\nSometimes Wood buys her top holdings on the way down, hoping for a bargain. That’s what she just did.\n\nIt’s been a weak start to the year for Wood. As of Feb. 13, Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) was down 9.79% year to date, while the S&P 500 lost 0.14%, as pressure mounted on growth-focused tech stocks.\n\nWood gained a reputation after her Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. Last year, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF gained 35.49%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 17.88% in the same period.\n\nBut Wood's style also brings painful losses in bearish markets, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\n\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term gains. As of Feb. 13, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -14.67%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 13.33% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nWood focuses on high-tech companies across artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics. She thinks these businesses have great growth potential, though their volatility often causes fluctuations in the Ark’s funds.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking. The analyst hasn’t updated the 2025 ranking.\n\nIn a letter published on Jan. 15, Wood says the U.S. economy is storing up energy for a sharp rebound in 2026.\n\n\"Despite sustained real gross domestic product growth during the past three years, the underlying US economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years,\" Wood wrote.\n\nWood also rejects the “AI bubble” talk, saying it \"is years away\" and \"the most powerful capital spending cycle in history\" is coming.\n\n\"What once was the cap in spending seems to have become a floor now that the AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and multiomics sequencing platforms are ready for prime time,\" she said.\n\nNot all investors agree with Wood’s optimism. In the 12 months through Feb. 11, the Ark Innovation ETF saw roughly $1.4 billion in net outflows, according to ETF research firm VettaFi.",

    "description": "Wall Street's preeminent valuation yardstick offers a worrisome tale for investors.",
    "fullText": "From an investment standpoint, Wall Street is a fan of Donald Trump in the White House. During President Trump's first term in office, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nIn the year and change since he was inaugurated for his second, non-consecutive term, an encore Trump bull market rally has taken shape. From Jan. 20, 2025, through the closing bell on Feb. 10, 2026, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have, respectively, rallied 15%, 16%, and 18%. Outsize returns have become something of the norm.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile several catalysts are behind this exceptionally strong bull market, some of which can be attributed to Donald Trump, there are also headwinds that can derail this rally. One insurmountable obstacle that has over 150 years of history in its sails is of particular concern.\n\nTo get a bit of housekeeping out of the way, Wall Street's major indexes climbing is nothing new. Since March 1897, there have been 33 presidential terms, 26 of which resulted in a positive return in either the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500. Most presidents oversee a growing U.S. economy and investment optimism, leading to stock market gains during their tenure -- and Trump has been no exception.\n\nHowever, the early annualized return for President Trump's second term is among the best of any president dating back well over a century. As investors, it pays to understand what's behind this outsize return.\n\nNot all of the stock market's upside catalysts have been influenced by the president. For instance, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which began during Joe Biden's presidency, and the advent of quantum computing are playing key roles in lifting the broader market. Analysts at PwC believe AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, while Boston Consulting Group estimates quantum computing will create up to $850 billion in global economic value by 2040. These technologies are clearly exciting investors.\n\nLikewise, President Trump had no hand in the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates on six occasions since September 2024. Lowering lending rates can encourage corporate borrowing, in turn leading to an increase in hiring, acquisition activity, and capital devoted to innovation.",

    "description": "A review of over 500 reports of cannibalistic behavior in snakes finds it's appeared multiple times in different evolutionary lineages, leading researchers to hypothesize it's beneficial for snakes un...",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCannibalism might seem like a rare and unnatural occurrence, but the behavior has arisen in several snake lineages throughout evolutionary history, often triggered by environmental stressors, scientists theorize.\n\nWhen researchers reviewed 500 reports of cannibalistic behavior across snake species, they found that cannibalism has evolved independently at least 11 times, according to a study published Nov. 2, 2025, in the journal Biological Reviews.\n\nThese cannibalistic behaviors occur in diverse contexts, but overall, cannibalism is common and seems to emerge repeatedly because it's beneficial to snakes in situations where they need to make opportunistic dietary choices, the researchers suggest.\n\n\"For us humans, we don't think of cannibalism as something common –– it's something weird and disgusting,\" Bruna Falcão, lead author of the study and a graduate student in biology at the University of São Paulo, told Live Science. \"But for snakes, it's good for them; it's good for their ecological fitness. … It's strategic.\"\n\nSome of the best-known examples of cannibalism in nature are seen in spiders and praying mantises during mating, as it may be beneficial for females to eat their mates. \"Cannibalism is widespread throughout the animal kingdom,\" Xavier Glaudas, a biologist and National Geographic Explorer who was not involved with the study, told Live Science.\n\nAlthough scientists previously considered the behavior maladaptive –– meaning it's not beneficial for a species overall –– more and more studies reporting cannibalism in animals hypothesize reasons for the evolution of the behavior. For example, it could help parents control brood size, or it might arise as a response to limited resource availability, a form of population control, or an opportunistic predation choice.\n\nCannibalistic behavior in snakes has typically been recounted in brief and isolated reports, Glaudas said. For example, his research team described male Montpellier snakes (Malpolon monspessulanus) feeding on female snakes in France — a behavior thought to be driven by limited food resources, especially during times of scarcity outside the mating season. (It would be considered unusual for males to eat females during the mating season, as this would reduce mating opportunities.)\n\nIn addition to being widespread in snakes, cannibalism has evolved independently across different snake lineages and regions, according to the study, which combined numerous reports to explain the behavior.\n\nThe research team gathered 503 cases of reported cannibalism across 207 snake species. The reports spanned a wide range of snake groups, as well as all continents where snakes live, including reports of snakes both in the wild and in captivity.\n\n\"None of us expected that … snakes could be so cannibalistic, and no one was talking about it,\" Falcão said. \"The more we were searching, the more cases we found.\"\n\nCannibalism was most common in the Colubridae, Viperidae and Elapidae families, the team found. Colubridae is the biggest family of snakes and made up 29% of all reports. Because this family is not typically known to prey on snakes, however, the authors proposed that most cases of cannibalism in this group may be connected to stressors such as a lack of other food sources. Members of the Viperidae family, which includes vipers, made up 21% of all cannibalism reports. But these were mostly cases in captivity, the researchers noted, so captivity-related stressors, like confinement to small spaces with limited food, may have resulted in cannibalism.\n\nElapidae, the snake family that includes cobras, accounted for about 19% of the cannibalism reports. This wasn't very surprising, the researchers said, because cobras are known to prey on other snakes in the wild.\n\nAlmost half of the cannibal snake species have generalist diets, according to the study, and the researchers linked this dietary flexibility to cannibalistic behavior when necessary. However, Glaudas suggested this connection may not be clear, since the researchers defined only 47.7% of the cannibal snake species as generalist; evidence for the relationship would be stronger if the percentage were higher, he said.\n\n\"In regard to the idea that cannibalism could be more common in generalist species, I am a bit more skeptical about the data presented,\" Glaudas said.\n\nCannibalistic behavior does seem to be correlated with jaw structure, so whether a snake has jaws that can open wide enough to consume another snake is a key factor; there were no reports of cannibalism in snake species without this ability.\n\nWhen the researchers analyzed cannibalistic behavior across snakes' evolutionary history, they concluded that the behavior evolved independently at least 11 times throughout the snake evolutionary tree.\n\n—Anacondas became massive 12 million years ago — and it worked so well, they haven't changed size since\n\n—'An up-tempo version of Darwinian evolution': How a mega freeze in Florida may have caused Burmese pythons to evolve at a blindingly fast speed\n\n—Cannibal animals: 12 creatures that gobble up their own kind\n\nBecause most reports of cannibalism in snakes are anecdotal, Glaudas said, the study provides a useful overview. This is a \"welcome study that allows us to get a better understanding of the correlates of cannibalism in snakes,\" Glaudas said.\n\nSnakes form a highly successful branch of the evolutionary tree. They are found on all continents except Antarctica and have adapted to most ecological niches, the study authors noted. Because cannibalistic behavior appears in many different types of snakes throughout the world, Falcão said, it might reflect their ability to adapt opportunistically to their circumstances. \"It's really surprising for [cannibalism] to evolve independently 11 times in snake lineages,\" she noted.\n\nThe review could not encapsulate all reports of cannibalism in snakes — many are in less-accessible, older books and archives — so there's likely much more to discover on the topic, Falcão said.",

    "description": "\"Future mortality will depend on how health systems, policymakers, and societies address the risks now.\"",
    "fullText": "Scientists warn a new pandemic is taking shape as public trust in data and science wanes, making it challenging to respond effectively to looming threats.\n\nFrontiers, a global leader in science publishing, opened its doors to leaders in Davos, Switzerland, in January to champion solutions that promote healthy lives and a healthy planet.\n\nAt one of its sessions, Vanina Laurent-Ledru, chief public health and government affairs officer of Institut Mérieux and bioMérieux, spoke about the next pandemic, which scientists fear could kill more people than cancer by 2050: antimicrobial resistance, or AMR.\n\nAlarmingly, Ledru said, \"No one is speaking about it.\"\n\nAdèle James, co-founder and chief technology officer of biotech firm Phagos, echoed those sentiments, referring to AMR as \"a silent pandemic.\"\n\nAs Jeff Goldblum's character famously said in Jurassic Park, \"Life finds a way.\" According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that's essentially what's happening with AMR.\n\n\"To survive, germs can develop defense strategies against antibiotics and antifungals,\" the agency wrote. (Unlike bacteria, viruses are technically considered non-living, but they fall under the AMR umbrella.) These germs can then share their defense mechanisms with germs that haven't encountered antibiotics or antifungals.\n\nThis is a serious problem because modern medicine relies heavily on these treatments for life-saving procedures and to heal what would otherwise be deadly infections. Antibiotics alone are believed to have expanded the average human lifespan by over two decades.\n\n\"Experts at Davos said the threat is clear — but worry that without urgent attention, the world may once again wait too long to act,\" Newsweek reported in its coverage of the Frontiers Science House.\n\nGerms can receive an unintentional helping hand from humans in their fight for survival.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nStudies suggest microplastics and air pollution are playing a role. As the CDC and World Health Organization have documented, the misuse and overuse of antibiotics are accelerating germ evolution. For example, antibiotics are effective against certain bacterial infections. Yet they are powerless against viral infections such as colds, the flu, and most sore throats.\n\nStill, millions of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are issued each year in the United States. CDC researchers discovered that around one-third of the prescriptions are unneeded.\n\nSeveral speakers at Davos discussed the emergence of promising adaptive treatments, such as phage-based medicines. Yet they also emphasized the need to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and to promote behaviors that support health, including proper hygiene (e.g., hand washing).\n\n\"Future mortality will depend on how health systems, policymakers, and societies address the risks now,\" Frontiers concluded.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S.",
    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S. Departments of Energy and Defense on Sunday for the first time transported a small nuclear reactor on a cargo plane from California to Utah to ‌demonstrate the potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe agencies partnered with California-based Valar Atomics to ‌fly one of the company’s Ward microreactors on a C-17 aircraft — without nuclear fuel — to Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Under ​Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Michael Duffey were on the C-17 flight with the reactor and its components, and hailed the event as a breakthrough for U.S. nuclear energy and military logistics.\n\n“This gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration sees small nuclear reactors as one ‌of several ways to expand U.S. energy production. Trump ⁠last May issued four executive orders aimed at boosting domestic nuclear deployment to meet growing demand for energy for national security and competitive AI advancements.\n\nThe Energy Department in December issued two grants to help ⁠accelerate development of small modular reactors.\n\nProponents of microreactors also have touted them as energy sources that can be sent to far-flung and remote places, offering an alternative to diesel generators which require frequent deliveries of fuel. But skeptics have argued that the industry has not proven that small ​nuclear reactors ​can generate power for a reasonable price.\n\n\"There is no business case for ​microreactors, which — even if they work as designed — will ‌produce electricity at a far higher cost than large nuclear reactors, not to mention renewables like wind or solar,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThe Energy Department plans to have three microreactors reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain itself — by July 4, Wright said.\n\nThe microreactor in Sunday's event, a little larger than a minivan, can generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, according to Valar CEO Isaiah Taylor. It will start operating in July ‌at 100 kilowatts and peak at 250 kilowatts this year before ramping up ​to full capacity, he said.\n\nValar hopes to start selling power on a test ​basis in 2027 and become fully commercial in 2028. ​Although private industry funds its own development of nuclear technology, it also needs the federal government “doing some ‌enabling actions to allow fuel fabrication here and uranium ​enrichment here,” he said.\n\nFuel for Valar's ​reactor will be transported from the Nevada National Security site to the San Rafael facility, Wright told reporters.\n\nHowever, even small generators result in a significant amount of radioactive waste, Lyman said. Other experts have said designers are not compelled to ​consider waste at inception, beyond a plan for ‌how it will be managed.\n\nAlthough disposal of nuclear waste remains an unresolved issue, the Energy Department is in talks ​with a few states, including Utah, to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal, Wright ​said.",

    "description": "\"The situation is desperate, but we fear the worst is yet to come.\"",
    "fullText": "The numbers are staggering. More than 3 million people in Somalia have left their homes following a devastating drought that has hit the country's rural regions. It is estimated that almost 6 million people in the East African country need aid. Of those in need of help, 1.85 million are children.\n\nThe impacts of four straight failed rainy seasons have destroyed crops and killed livestock across large portions of Africa. While the worst conditions have peaked in Somalia, the bordering countries of Ethiopia and Kenya are also suffering. More than 2 million people in Kenya alone are facing hunger amid the ongoing drought that has left livestock emaciated in livestock-rearing communities.\n\nIslamic Relief is a global humanitarian organization founded in 1984 in the U.K. that delivers aid to those in need across more than 40 countries, regardless of faith, ethnicity, or background. A recent report from the organization titled \"Urgent action needed to save lives as severe drought worsens across the Horn of Africa\" warns that children who have sought help in camps are \"showing visible signs of malnutrition and wasting,\" per the Associated Press.\n\nThe large loss of livestock brings back memories of another, even more devastating drought that struck some of the same countries now being affected. During the drought that lasted from 2020 to 2023, millions of animals perished in portions of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia.\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme reported that nearly 10 million livestock died during that prolonged drought. Livestock accounts for 45% of Somalia's GDP.\n\n\"Climate change is driving increasingly frequent extreme weather events in the Horn of Africa — this latest drought comes as the region is still recovering from its worst drought in 70 years due to successive failed rains between 2021 and 2023, which was followed by deadly floods,\" according to the Islamic Relief report. \"Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya produce only around 0.1% of global carbon emissions, yet people there are paying the highest price of the global climate crisis.\"\n\nThe conditions with the current drought are dire, and the outlook remains bleak. \"The situation is desperate, but we fear the worst is yet to come,\" said Aliow Mohamed, Islamic Relief's Country Director in Somalia. \"Our teams across Somalia are already seeing livestock deaths, water scarcity, and rising malnutrition.\"\n\n\"Masses of people are fleeing rural areas for camps where they hope to get some aid, but there is not enough aid for everyone,\" Mohamed added. \"In many places, local communities are providing new arrivals with food and water, even though they have barely enough for themselves. The next few months are critical — we must act now to stop this drought turning into famine.\"\n\nKenya and other East African countries are highly exposed to several forms of extreme weather, which are exacerbated by our warming world. \"Kenya's vulnerability to climate change is worsened by frequent and intense droughts, storms, floods, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and warming oceans, leading to direct devastation of biotic systems and natural habitats, which have severe socioeconomic impacts,\" a report from the National Council for Population and Development concluded.\n\nScientists warn that Kenya's second-largest city, Mombasa, is facing a convergence of climate hazards that could overwhelm low-lying neighborhoods and key transport routes. Flooding, mangrove loss, and saltwater contamination threaten lives, livelihoods, and the backbone of Kenya's coastal economy.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "When Sebastian Musson climbs walls with one hand, he knows it looks like he is redefining the impossible.\n\nThe four-time British Para-climbing champion is focused on winning a historic gold medal when the sport features at the Paralympics for the first time at the Los Angeles Games in 2028.\n\nCompeting there would mark an incredible high for the 19-year-old from Long Eaton, who has quickly scaled to third in the world rankings after a chance encounter at his local climbing centre in Derby got him into the sport just six years ago.\n\nUntil he was approached by Anita Aggarwal, a British Para-climbing champion who works as an inclusive climbing coach, Musson had not considered the possibilities open to him.\n\nBut not only did he quickly realise what he could be capable of, so did climbers around him and just about every bystander that has caught a glimpse of him in action.\n\n\"It's being able to do something that people don't expect you to be able to do when they see that I've got one hand,\" Musson told BBC East Midlands Today.\n\n\"I go up climbs where people themselves can't go up, and I'm doing it without a hand.\n\n\"It's just something that is inspiring to other people and I absolutely love doing it.\"\n\nPara-climbing to make Paralympic debut at Los Angeles 2028\n\nHow 'an adult's playground' changed Aggarwal's life\n\nMusson knows what it means to be inspired.\n\nHe was only four years old in 2012 when he watched the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London and made what has turned out to be a life-defining statement.\n\n\"I said to my parents 'that's what I want to do, I want to go to the Paralympics and I want to win gold',\" he said.\n\nMusson smiles when talking about it, because for more than a decade he admits he \"didn't have a sport\" to focus on despite his grand ambition.\n\nBut in Para-climbing, he has found a way to try to ascend to Paralympic glory.\n\n\"I'm taking it all the way and going to go achieve that dream,\" he said.\n\n\"I am very much thinking about LA and aiming for the gold medal.\"\n\nIn 2024, Musson claimed his first international medal when he won silver in the AU2 category - for athletes with moderate upper-limb impairments - at the European Championships in Villars, Switzerland.\n\nHe has since collected bronze medals at World Cup events in Italy and the United States.\n\nAnd all the success so far can be traced back to a rainy day in 2018 when Musson was forced indoors instead of attending his usual rugby union training session.\n\nIt was soon after that Aggarwal spotted the novice and asked to coach him.\n\n\"Instead of just sitting around at home, my dad suggested we go climbing, so we did. And after the first session I was absolutely hooked,\" Musson said.\n\n\"It was the second time we went that I met Anita. The impact of meeting her I don't think I could comprehend at the time. If it wasn't for her, I don't think I'd be climbing right now, especially in the situation that I'm in now.\"\n\nMusson's coach turned international team-mate Aggarwal - who has multiple sclerosis, which affects the brain and spinal cord - describes climbing walls as an \"adult playground\" where participants are not limited by rules or their physical traits.\n\n\"It's a really welcoming environment because all we've got is puzzles on the wall, and the idea is to break the puzzle,\" she said.\n\n\"My team-mates are armless, legless, blind and neurological and they can still climb better than me and they're missing limbs or they have no eyes.\n\n\"From an inclusive point of view there is no exclusivity because there's no rules in climbing. The only rule is can you put one or two hands on the top hold? How you get there is entirely up to you.\"\n\nWhen Aggarwal first saw Musson on a climbing wall, she said she \"couldn't help\" but approach the youngster and encourage him to get involved in the coaching sessions she was running.\n\nThere were things that had to be learned and adapted to when Musson started training with her - the tying of shoelaces with one hand among them.\n\nIt is something they both reflect on with a laugh - with Aggarwal saying he just \"didn't twig\", but Musson quickly found a solution in velcro shoes.\n\nAnd now, the athlete Aggarwal says \"didn't know he was a Para-climber\" when they first met is aiming to become a trailblazer on a global stage in LA.\n\n\"I've seen how much it's changed him from being introverted, really quiet and hiding his arm, to now being a really outgoing person teaching other kids and competing for his country,\" Aggarwal said of Musson.\n\n\"He's got expectations and goals and it's just been amazing.\"",

    "fullText": "Head coach Andy Farrell issued an impassioned plea for \"keyboard warriors to cop on and try to help\" Sam Prendergast and Jack Crowley amid a \"damaging\" narrative about Ireland's fly-half situation.\n\nCrowley played every minute of Ireland's triumphant 2024 Six Nations campaign and Prendergast has started all but one of the seven championship games since.\n\nPrendergast struggled in Ireland's win over Italy in Dublin on Saturday before being replaced by Crowley, whose high-tempo display leaves Farrell with another selection headache before facing England.\n\nFarrell said: \"Do you know what, I might be talking out of school here, but in my opinion for what's gone on over the last year or something, especially with the keyboard warriors, I think people need to ask themselves, really, sometimes, 'Are we Irish? Do we want people to do well or not?'\n\n\"Because it can be tough for these kids like, you know? It can be tough for these kids. I've seen it, to-ing and fro-ing with both of them, and both of them are strong characters.\n\n\"It takes a lot to break kids like that. But I've seen it affect people, you know. So the keyboard warriors on Twitter or whatever you call it now need to cop on and try and help these kids.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's damaging, you know.\"\n\nIreland survive Italy scare to claim first win\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nItaly captain Lamaro proud perception has changed\n\nFarrell praised Crowley's performance off the bench after the 26-year-old helped steer Ireland to victory against an impressive Italy side who led at half-time only to be denied their first Six Nations win in Dublin.\n\nHowever, Crowley's day ended in frustration when he kicked the ball dead as Ireland chased a last-gasp bonus-point try.\n\n\"He's gutted about the kick into the corner obviously but he did a lot more than that for us,\" added Farrell.\n\n\"He did a lot more good for us than harm and he can be proud of his performance today.\"\n\nOn Prendergast, who missed two conversion attempts, Farrell said: \"He'd be frustrated with bits.\n\n\"Down the line, these two lads, and others, they will be the players that they want to be. Everyone goes through these types of scenarios.\"\n\nPrendergast made his Ireland debut aged 21 in November 2024 but he and Crowley were overlooked by Farrell for last year's British and Irish Lions tour to Australia.\n\nHowever, when asked if he feels he thrust the Leinster player into the unforgiving rigours of Test rugby too early in his career, Farrell said: \"No, I've no problem at all. He was playing outstanding rugby and he will continue to do that.\"\n\nWhile he would have hoped for a more assertive display from Prendergast, there were positives for Farrell to take into Saturday's match against England.\n\nRobert Baloucoune marked his Six Nations debut with a decisive try and Stuart McCloskey notched two try assists in another all-action display in midfield, while Farrell described James Lowe's performance as \"outstanding\" after being dropped for the France defeat.\n\nBut Ireland will be wary of a strong response from England, whose early-tournament momentum was punctured by a resurgent Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday.\n\n\"You could say we have nothing to lose, but we do. We want to win. We want to play better,\" said Farrell, speaking before full-time in the Scotland v England game.",

I said I wasn't going to put on a show for them but I gave them a show.\"\n\nThe Stripes missed their first 10 shots in the final as the younger Stars team raced into a 12-1 lead. The Stars later added a 15-0 run for a 33-9 advantage as the veterans were well beaten.\n\nNBA all-time scoring leader LeBron James, 41, who was making his 22nd appearance in the All-Star Game, added five for the Stripes.\n\nIn the round-robin opener at Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome, Edwards scored 13 points as the USA Stars beat the World team 37-35.\n\nYet he was afterwards keen to highlight the performance of San Antonio Spurs' Victor Wembanyama, with the Frenchman producing 14 points, six rebounds and three blocks in his side's defeat.\n\n\"I ain't going to lie, Wemby set the tone,\" said Edwards. \"He came out hard and we had to follow that. We had to pick it up and we did that.\"\n\nThe World team were without injured stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander while Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic combined for only two points, two rebounds and two assists.\n\nThey lost the third game 48-45 to the Stripes, meaning they were eliminated and the final would be a repeat of the second game, which the Stripes had won 42-40.\n\nThe new format was seen as a success after criticism of recent editions being lacklustre.\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama, who was courtside, said: \"I know a lot of people have been concerned about the All-Star Game, not seeing as much effort. But we saw it.\"",

    "fullText": "The search for the missing mother of NBC TODAY Show host Savannah Guthrie continues, two weeks after her initial disappearance. The latest development is sobering.\n\nPima County Sheriff Chris Nanos recently gave an interview to the New York Times and made it clear that authorities are uncertain of when they will be able to crack the case. Nanos went as far as to say it could take “years” for Guthrie to be found.\n\n“Maybe it’s an hour from now,” Nanos said of the search. “Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now.

    "fullText": "A bill to revise how property taxes are levied in Missouri also includes provisions that could move all local elections from April to November (Getty Images).\n\nA property tax overhaul moving through the Missouri House includes provisions that would potentially push all elections to August and November. The bill’s sponsor, however, said that’s not his intent and will make any changes necessary to prevent it.\n\nThe measure that would require taxing districts to set separate rates for each type of property also requires all property tax elections to be on an August or November ballot. But the language that would accomplish the change in election dates, critics warn, is far broader than necessary.\n\n“It is just rife with drafting errors,” said Boone County Clerk Brianna Lennon. “This is what concerns me.”\n\nUnder current law, partisan primary and general elections are held in August and November of even numbered years. The first Tuesday after the first Monday of April every year is set aside as the general municipal election day, when mostly non-partisan local offices are filled and measures such as tax and bond elections are held.\n\nThe bill given first-round approval last week, however, states that all primaries “for local, state and national offices” would be in August and “all general elections for local, state and national offices and issues” would be in November.\n\n“I don’t see how they are reading that April is not gone,” Lennon said.\n\nThe 165-page bill sponsored by state Rep. Tim Taylor, a Republican from Bunceton, moved forward on a voice vote and is scheduled for a committee hearing Monday afternoon on its fiscal impact. If the bill is approved in the committee, Taylor said he expects a final House vote later in the afternoon.\n\nIn an interview Friday with The Independent, Taylor said he only wants to move property tax elections from April to November.\n\n“The intent is absolutely not to move all elections from April,” Taylor said.\n\nMissouri House advances bill to silo property tax rates, move tax elections to November\n\nThe benefit of moving property tax elections to November is the greater voter turnout, Taylor said. There were 160 property tax ballot proposals before voters in 2024 from 2,811 taxing districts, Taylor said.\n\n“It does not seem insurmountable to move that to November,” he said.\n\nLennon’s concerns echo those of state Rep. Peggy McGaugh, a Republican from Carrollton who was Carroll County Clerk for nearly 24 years. During debate, McGaugh said she was certain the bill, if passed unchanged, would end April elections.\n\nThe November ballot would become longer, she said, and major national and statewide races and issues in November elections would make it more difficult to educate voters on local questions and candidates.\n\n“If you shift all elections to November, your ballot is going to be so long that voter fatigue is an issue, and the very taxes that you may want to have passed or failed are going to get lost in all the issues before it or behind it,” McGaugh said.\n\nTaylor said he’s not convinced voters will tire before they get to local issues and leave the ballot for those issues blank.\n\n“I am not going to insinuate they don’t have the stamina and the strength and the fortitude to read the whole ballot,” Taylor said.\n\nIn Boone County, turnout in the past five April elections ranged from 14% to 25% of registered voters. Approximately 70% of voters cast ballots in the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections, while 50% came to the polls for the 2022 off-year election.\n\nThe money spent to energize voters for a November election is one reason turnout is so high, Lennon said.\n\nLocal governments trying to get voters’ attention would have to “break through the noise” of a November election where candidates and issue campaigns are spending millions, Lennon said.\n\nLocal taxing districts can distribute material describing how money from a tax levy would be used but are barred by state law from using that material to advocate for a favorable vote. Organized spending for a local ballot measure is often less than $10,000.\n\n“Which, again, is why we see lower turnout in April, because that amount of money is not being spent on issues in the April elections,” Lennon said.\n\nThere would be some cost savings associated with moving all elections from April to November, Lennon said. It would reduce outlays to rent locations for polling stations and payroll for election judges, she said.\n\nBut the savings, she said, would come at the cost of potentially using two-page ballots. The equipment she uses can accommodate a ballot of up to 19 inches long, she said.\n\nThe November 2024 ballot was 17 inches long and covered two sides of the paper, she said.\n\nTwo-page ballots bring extra challenges for verifying results, Lennon said.\n\n“Reconciliation of the number of voters who check in to the number of ballots received gets really difficult,” Lennon said. “It is after the fact difficult to match up if voters choose not to cast both ballots.”\n\nThe changes Taylor wants to enact for property tax elections is not limited to the date when votes are cast. The ballot would also include an estimate of how much a proposed tax would cost property owners for every $100,000 of the base value used for assessments.\n\nAnd every ballot question would state the percentage increase in taxes from an increased levy, the reason the taxing district needs the money and the length of time the tax would be in place.\n\nThe uncertainty about the way the bill is drafted is not enough to back up and revise it, Taylor said.\n\nThe election provision will be studied, Taylor said, and if necessary, he would recommend changes as the bill is revised in the state Senate. It’s already too late for the bill to be revised any further in the House.\n\nHe wants to work with local election authorities to refine the bill, he said.\n\n“I want to make this right,” Taylor said. “This bill is just getting off the ground and there is going to be a lot of massaging along the way.”\n\nThe tax bill was moved too quickly, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, said last week at a news conference. Most of the time used during debate was on an amendment that standardized the ballot questions for property tax measures. Other important issues in the bill were not discussed, she said.\n\n“Democrats are on board with providing Missourians much needed property tax relief, but details matter, and we barely scratched the surface of how this bill impacts local governments and their ability to serve residents,” Aune said.\n\nTo move to the Senate, the bill needs 82 votes. The bill has supporters and critics in both parties, Taylor said.\n\nHis appeal to colleagues will be to keep the bill moving, Taylor said. The bill is certain to be revised in the Senate, and if it clears that chamber the House will have another vote later.\n\n“My job is to convince them this process is far from over,” Taylor said, “and we are going to have ample opportunity to get something across the finish line.”",

    "description": "BBC Sport takes a look at why there is a second hiatus in the Women's Super League so soon after the winter break.",
    "fullText": "Now matchweek 16 has finished, the Women's Super League will take a month-long break.\n\nIt is not a total pause on fixtures, with players, managers and fans switching focus to various other competitions in the meantime.\n\nArsenal and Manchester United will contest the second legs of their Champions League knockout play-off ties on Wednesday and Thursday, while 10 of the 12 top-flight teams play in the FA Cup fifth round next weekend.\n\nAfter that, many players will join their national teams, with the start of March occupied by World Cup qualifiers, the Asian Cup and various other international matches.\n\nHowever, coming just six weeks after the WSL's winter break, BBC Sport takes a look at the impact this latest hiatus might have.\n\nSince action resumed on Saturday, 10 January, it has been a hectic period.\n\nFour rounds of WSL action, FA Cup fourth round, League Cup semi-finals, the return of the Champions League and Arsenal competing in the inaugural Fifa Champions Cup have all been squeezed into a packed schedule.\n\nYet there is a stark difference between the amount of games played by the top teams and those lower down the division, including concerns about schedule congestion for teams fighting on multiple fronts, and the toll it could take on players.\n\nBottom side Leicester City have played the fewest games so far this season (19) and, having suffered early exits in both domestic cups, they now face an entire month without a competitive fixture.\n\nTheir next fixture is a crucial game against 11th-placed Liverpool in the WSL on Sunday, 15 March (11:55 GMT).\n\nIt's an entirely different scenario for Manchester United though, who have played the most games to date (30).\n\nThis week, they will play Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Thursday (20:00 GMT), and then take on Chelsea next Sunday in the FA Cup fifth round (13:30 GMT) before they return to WSL action in mid March.\n\nThe below graph shows the amount of fixtures played by every team in the WSL so far - with the green bars representing the maximum number each could play, should they win out in each competition that they are playing in.\n\nSuch discrepancy in fixtures will be impacted next season as the Women's Super League expands from 12 to 14, although it may just mean more games all round.\n\nFormer England defender Anita Asante says a four-week break at this stage of the season could have a hefty impact on the momentum of WSL teams.\n\n\"I think it does, because for players and staff it affects consistency that allows them to build from one performance to the next,\" she said.\n\n\"It's the close connection on the training pitch and the learning that takes place off the pitch. When they are away from that, it makes it really challenging.\n\n\"You have to start from the beginning again.\"\n\nThose effects may be felt more keenly by certain Women's Super League teams, with Asante suggesting the break favours bigger clubs.\n\n\"It's not to say that players and staff can't get back to playing quickly, because we've seen that the top teams are able to do that,\" said Asante.\n\n\"Their squads have been built and have been together for more than one season – that puts them in a better position. However if you have a new squad you don't want those breaks and pauses in the season.\"\n\nWSL expanding to 14 teams - but relegation remains\n\nAsante also thinks that the break could do more harm than good for WSL fans, both existing and potential.\n\n\"For the wider marketability of the game, my gut feeling is the break is too long,\" she said. \"While we are still growing the women's game, can we afford to have these pauses?\n\n\"If you are talking about keeping engagement and keeping fans aware of when the next games are, you want continuity and momentum. That allows for good storytelling.\n\n\"With four weeks away, other sports, passions or distractions can fill that time.\"\n\nThere have been mixed thoughts from supporters. Here are some of your opinions:\n\nCathy: There are too many breaks in the WSL - there aren't actually that many games anyway because the league is so small. Understand need for international break but shouldn't have so soon after winter break (which is too long).\n\nNiamh: Hopefully with the expansion of the league it means that more games will happen so less breaks!\n\nDan: Football is a winter sport! Saturday at 3pm, Tuesday at 7:45pm (Sunday and Wednesday for women's games if need be). Why do they need to keep changing everything? The game isn't broken, governing bodies are.\n\nTom: I was guessing that with two more teams in the league next season these breaks might have to shrink a bit anyway. Let's build slowly we don't want to exhaust the players.\n\nMary: When there are comments about the packed WSL schedule, along with other competitions, it's a double-edged sword. More games to fit in but a rest from the pressure. It does disrupt the flow in the league, contributing to inconsistent game performances and results.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nPremier League announces replacement for Rainbow Laces\n\nWho has the most Premier League appearances?\n\nWhere do iconic football moves originate from?\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

And a wounded king is dangerous,\" said former Madrid coach Mourinho.\n\n\"We will play the first leg with our heads, ambition and confidence.

    "description": "In-depth preview of leaders Middlesbrough's game against second-placed Coventry in a key game in the Championship season.",
    "fullText": "With two-thirds of the Championship season gone, the division has been dominated by two sides - Coventry City and Middlesbrough.\n\nSince matchday four at the end of August, one of these two have occupied top spot as they aim to end lengthy absences from the Premier League.\n\nBut this is not a tale of one-way traffic to glory, but exciting twists and turns characterised by winning runs, lots of goals, managerial upheaval and poor runs.\n\nTheir top-two clash in November saw Coventry win a thrilling game 4-2 at the Riverside Stadium to open up a 10-point cushion.\n\nNow Boro head to the CBS Arena for the return fixture with a two-point advantage after a huge shift in momentum and form.\n\nAs the two pacesetters make their final preparations for the biggest game in the division so far this season, BBC Sport looks into the key aspects of the encounter.\n\nWhen you examine the cold facts, the answer might seem obvious, with Middlesbrough on fire after six consecutive wins and Coventry having only picked up four victories in their past 13 league games, including a frustrating goalless draw at home to 10-man relegation-threatened Oxford United in their last one.\n\nBut a psychological crisis for one team might be another's moment of clarity, and how the two sides respond under the shifting pressure of swapping roles will be fascinating.\n\nNot just for this game but for the rest of the run-in.\n\n\"With a team like Coventry their dip in form is rarely tactical, it's more psychological,\" Peter Dutton, an elite sport performance psychologist, told BBC CWR.\n\n\"They've led for long periods, so players can shift from playing freely to playing not to lose.\n\n\"So it may take slight pressure off them, sitting in the position they're in now rather than top of the table.\"\n\nAs for Boro and their superb run, Dutton said they should feel similarly uninhibited.\n\nHe added: \"If you look at Middlesbrough, their confidence will be high and they're playing without the weight of defending their long lead like Coventry.\n\n\"They can be more free and expressive and Coventry might feel a bit more defensive.\"\n\nFrank Lampard understands why many are highlighting his side's new position in the table and how that might affect them.\n\n\"It depends how you want to frame it,\" the Sky Blues manager told BBC CWR.\n\n\"People are comparing the pressure of being top and being second. These pressures are great. If you'd offered me those at the start of the season I'd have bitten your hand off.\n\n\"It's important the lads are just focused on us.\n\n\"We've shown ourselves to be a very good team this season in the league and we need to bring that version of ourselves on Monday.\"\n\nWhen it comes to big occasions, you would be hard pressed to find someone with more T-shirts in his 'been there, done that' wardrobe than Lampard.\n\nThe 106 England caps. The three World Cups. The 11 major trophies for Chelsea. Super Cup, FA Cup - and play-off finals as a manager.\n\nThe Swede admitted recently on Middlesbrough's 'Yer Joking Aren't Ya?' podcast that, growing up, he was a Chelsea fan and Lampard was his favourite player, and now the 38-year-old is tasked with getting the better of his one-time hero.\n\nBut for Dutton, Lampard's big-game experience should be a big help for the Sky Blues.\n\n\"To an extent as a manager that can help them battle,\" he said. \"It's more of a process than about position [in the table], more about consistency rather than seeing it as a threat.\n\n\"A really good question for him and the players is 'are we maintaining who we are or are we reacting to an opponent's rise?'\"\n\nDutton said that \"changes the focus\" of their preparation, enabling players to prioritise \"internal cues\" like \"effort, process and clarity\" rather than any \"external narratives\" in the build-up to the game.\n\n\"I still feel like they're the best two teams in the league,\" he said.\n\n\"I just think the experience Lampard has had as a player - and as manager in the Premier League and Championship - he's been there and done it, I just feel he's going to react and get the players to react in the right way.\"\n\nCoventry may come into this game on the back of a stuttering run, but this has been a kind fixture for them in recent years.\n\nThey have not lost any of their past nine meetings with Middlesbrough, stretching back more than four years.\n\nThey beat Boro at home last May in what was effectively a play-off shootout on the season's final day, and came through a two-legged play-off semi-final against them in 2023.\n\nBut despite those successes, ultimately there was only play-off heartache for Coventry, and it is a path they will not want to go down again this season, given the position they have been in and their recent post-season failures.\n\nBoro, meanwhile, will believe that if they can end a hoodoo against their bogey side, what can stop them ending nine years outside the Premier League.\n\n'Controlled chaos' as Boro overhaul Coventry at top\n\nA 10-point lead cut to three - is it just a blip for Coventry?\n\nCan anyone stop Lampard's Coventry winning the Championship?\n\nDespite Coventry's good record against Boro there is no getting away from their current form.\n\nOnly four wins in 13 games since the end of November.\n\nOnly 16 points from a possible 39.\n\nSeven without a win away from home.\n\nBut rather than see those wither further in the light of Boro's brilliance, Lampard said he is seeing that in isolation.\n\n\"Sometimes you just have to applaud six wins on the bounce, and even before that they had four wins when the manager came in, so it's an incredible run of form,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what changes the face of it slightly. We had our run, and we had a run last season of similar vein, and sometimes you say 'well done' and understand they are going to be difficult opponents.\n\n\"The players understand it. It's the top two in the league. Everyone's looking forward to it and has to have ultra focus.\n\n\"The intensity of the game's going to be big. Boro are a very good footballing team.\n\n\"Our form was amazing in the first half of the season and Boro have gone into similar form, and we've come off it.\"\n\nAs ever, at this stage, one result does not make a season, and Lampard knows that whatever happens at the CBS Arena on Monday, Ipswich Town, Hull City and Millwall are all demanding attention, with Millwall now just three points behind them in third.\n\nAs leaders, Coventry were the hunted. They still are.\n\n\"Is this must-win?\" Lampard said. \"No, because there are 14 others [games left].\n\n\"Do we want to win? Absolutely, yes.\n\n\"What's important for us now is action. We will have to be at our best to win.\"\n\nIt is impossible to understate just how impressive Boro have been since Hellberg took over in the aftermath of that Coventry defeat in November.\n\nThe Teesside club had started well under Rob Edwards before his departure to Wolves, but Boro have been the dominant team in the division over the past two-and-a-half months, scoring goals, dominating the ball and playing good football.\n\nAustralia midfielder Riley McGree has described the Swede's method as \"controlled chaos\" and it reached its peak in a fabulous opening 45 minutes at Bramall Lane seven days ago as they beat Sheffield United to pick up a sixth straight win.\n\nA magnificent seventh would open up a five-point cushion at the top for Middlesbrough. But for Hellberg, maintaining his team's identity is just as important in the grand scheme of things.\n\n\"I always believe in my team,\" he told BBC Radio Tees.\n\n\"I'm always trying to find a team a way for us to play the way we want to play against. That's always the first thing.\n\n\"We want to go there and take control of the game. We want to be ourselves. That's the number one. We know that if we do that well, we have a good chance of getting the result.\n\n\"The game will probably be small margins if we win or we lose, but we will go there and try to be ourselves. Over time, that's the thing that is going to give us most points over a season.\"\n\nBBC CWR Sports editor Rob Gurney\n\nThe big question we're all contemplating now is: can Middlesbrough cope with the pressure of being top, as the Sky Blues have had to since October?\n\nFrank Lampard describes it as \"great\" pressure, and he would have \"bitten your hand off\" if you had offered him first or second place at this point of the season, before a ball was kicked.\n\nThe reality is, though, that Middlesbrough are excelling, with six straight wins, and have taken 31 points from the last 14 games, to Coventry's 19 over the same span of matches.\n\nBut City have the best home record, and the best goal difference in the Championship, so we're about to find out how Boro manage the very different mindset of being chased.\n\nTalking about the mental preparation, Lampard confirmed to me that the club do employ the services of a sports psychologist, should the players need to tap into his expertise, although in the same breath, the manager said \"that's never really been for me\".\n\nThere will be 14 matches left after Monday but we've got to the stage where the Sky Blues need to strike back, after having their impressive lead usurped completely.\n\nIt's an occasion to be embraced, rather than intimidated by, but clearly one of those nights where far more than just three points is at stake.",

    "description": "It's been quite the few days in the Cortina Curling Stadium during a Winter Olympics that has delivered intrigue and excitement both on and off the field of play.",
    "fullText": "Accusations of cheating. Swear words being hurled across the ice. Counter-claims of a sting operation with illicit filming.\n\nThen changes to how games are officiated. Protests from teams. Another alteration to the protocols.\n\nIt's been quite the few days in the Cortina Curling Stadium during a Winter Olympics that has delivered intrigue and excitement both on and off the field of play.\n\nThe drama in the curling started on Friday.\n\nCanada's Marc Kennedy became involved in a heated verbal exchange with Swedish opponent Oskar Eriksson towards the end of his side's 8-6 win.\n\nThe Swedes believed Kennedy was repeatedly double-touching some of his stones - releasing the handle at the appropriate time but then giving the stone another little prod with his finger to correct its course. Not allowed.\n\nBut the cards were signed by both teams at the end, meaning the result would stand in a sport that is proudly self-governed by the players.\n\nWorld Curling later confirmed that \"decisions made during a game are final\" and that they do not use video replays \"to re-umpire\" decisions.\n\nThe only sanction given was to Kennedy for swearing.\n\nIntriguingly, Eriksson had told his opponent during the row that \"I'll show you the video after\" and, sure enough, footage found its way into circulation post-match.\n\nKennedy was bang to rights. But where had the video come from?\n\nThe word from Canada was that it was pre-meditated. A set-up. That the Swedes had deployed someone to try to catch them out in a game that is founded in trust and respect.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nWhy first gold on snow has been just a matter of time\n\n'Extremely stupid' - ski jumper disqualified for oversized boots\n\nThen the story took another turn when the Canadians returned to the ice on Saturday. Controversy flared around Kennedy again, with Switzerland reporting him to the umpire for the same offence in their 9-5 win.\n\nAgain, no action was taken against the 44-year-old veteran of four Olympics.\n\nAt that stage, World Curling needed to act. They announced they would deploy extra officials for the remainder of the Games to check for double-touching.\n\nCanadian women's skip Rachel Holman was pinged for a double touch. Team GB's Bobby Lammie fell victim too.\n\nBoth incidents were a case of a lingering finger falling on to the granite after the handle was released, rather than a deliberate touch, so no suggestion of devious intent. Furthermore, the monitoring of it seemed sporadic.\n\nThe teams were up in arms and complained. World Curling relented. The protocol was changed on Sunday. Teams could now request to have the stone delivery monitored if they had suspicions, and for a minimum of three ends.\n\nIn reality, that was also haphazardly executed.\n\nSo what does curling do about this? After all, this is a sport in which they determine which stone is nearest the target by using what is effectively a big compass.\n\nOne nod to progress is electric sensors to gauge if stones have been released before the hog line but could they drag themselves further into the modern era and use video technology?\n\nTeam GB lead Hammy McMillan thinks so.\n\n\"You bring in VAR or Hawk-Eye and each team gets a challenge or two, so you've got to be dead certain that somebody did that [violation],\" the Scot said.\n\n\"I think that would be quite cool, it would maybe make curling a bit more modernised. I think video review could be the next thing, with teams getting challenges.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "A 16-year-old Luke Matheson wrote his name in the history books by scoring against Manchester United in 2019. Six years later, he is aiming for more cup heroics with Macclesfield.",
    "fullText": "Remember the 16-year-old who scored for Rochdale against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup?\n\nIn September 2019, defender Luke Matheson netted a famous equaliser at Old Trafford to force a 1-1 draw in a third-round tie that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side eventually won 5-3 on penalties.\n\nThe next day he was back to school studying for his A-Levels.\n\nFast forward to 2026 and Matheson is part of a Macclesfield squad riding the crest of a wave in the FA Cup and preparing to face Brentford in the fourth round on Monday.\n\nThe Silkmen have been catapulted into the public eye since beating Crystal Palace in the third round for one of the biggest shocks in the competition's history - but the 23-year-old is no stranger to the spotlight.\n\n\"I was on the bus on the way to school the next morning with my mates,\" Matheson recalled after his Old Trafford heroics. \"Refreshing Instagram, there was a thousand [likes] here, another thousand there. It was one of the most surreal things I have ever been through.\n\n\"I remember the actual moment of the goal, I can picture it and tell you exactly what happened. It was more the aftermath I don't really remember.\n\n\"Even being on that pitch and travelling to that game was enough for me. Then to score took it to another level. It's definitely one of the best days of my life.\"\n\nBrentford will be the fourth Premier League opponent for Matheson, who also featured for Rochdale in a 1-1 home draw against Newcastle in the FA Cup in 2020, before his side lost the third-round replay 4-1 at St James' Park.\n\nHe said being remembered as the teenager who scored against Manchester United is something he is proud of, not ashamed by.\n\n\"I love people coming up to me saying, 'are you the kid that scored against United?' They always recognise me because of my hair,\" said the Manchester-born full-back.\n\n\"If that is the pinnacle of my career, it is the pinnacle of my career. Some players will dream about moments like that and I'm lucky that I got one at such a young age.\n\n\"I was a kid then and have a little bit more experience now. I've been around different clubs, different experiences, different managers, different changing rooms.\"\n\nFour months after his goal at Old Trafford, the England Under-18 international made the step from League One to the Premier League as he joined Wolves in a deal worth £1m.\n\n\"It was a dream come true,\" added Matheson, who made his Rochdale first-team debut at 15. \"I had been in and around it going away with England - it would be your Manchester City boys, Manchester United, Chelsea, and then me from Rochdale.\n\n\"I was getting around £400 a month from Rochdale on my scholarship and £250 of that was going on public transport to get me to training. Then I sign for Wolves and they've got three drivers who can take me to and from Manchester every day. The difference was astronomical.\"\n\nAfter making more than 30 senior appearances for Rochdale, he ended up in the under-23 set-up at Wolves.\n\n\"In that sense, for me in my personal career, it almost felt like I'd taken a step backwards,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of the under-23s were trying to get out on loan into a first team. I'd gone from doing that to not doing that.\"\n\nMatheson's time at Wolves was hampered by serious injuries and after loan spells with Ipswich, Hamilton Academical and Scunthorpe he was released at the end of the 2022-23 campaign without making a senior appearance for the club.\n\n\"My three-and-a-half years at Wolves was riddled,\" he admitted. \"It was a torrid time, I never really kicked on in the way that I'd hoped.\"\n\nAfter a severe, high-grade hamstring tear, Matheson was told by surgeons he might never play again, which prompted him to consider a life away from the football pitch.\n\nThe son of two primary school teachers, he had always been passionate about education and recently graduated alongside ex-Newcastle keeper Tim Krul and former Watford defender Adrian Mariappa with a diploma in sporting directorship from the Professional Footballers' Association's (PFA) business school .\n\nWhile he assesses options for life after football, Matheson makes the most of being a part-time player at Macclesfield and coaches their under-eight's team in his spare time.\n\nIt was during Matheson's rehab at Wolves that he also got to know Ethan McLeod, who he would later reunite with at Macclesfield.\n\nOn 16 December 2025, the 21-year-old forward McLeod died in a car accident while travelling back from a National League North match at Bedford Town.\n\nMatheson was among the majority of the squad held up in gridlocked traffic after the crash on the M1. Not long after he arrived home the next morning, manager John Rooney called every player individually to confirm the sad news.\n\n\"You don't realise how much a person almost saved you until they're not there anymore,\" said Matheson. \"I was lucky that I had the pleasure of getting to know him for three-and-a-half years at Wolves, and then again as we both matured and got older here.\n\n\"Unfortunately we did spend a lot of time together in rehab, but I'm grateful and very lucky that we did because it definitely impacted my career in a positive way.\n\n\"Through some of the darkest days of my career, with his infectious smile he would walk in and brighten up every single day.\"\n\nRooney signed Matheson 12 days after bringing McLeod to Macclesfield, but both players had a frustrating start to the campaign with injuries.\n\nMatheson said the pair often talked about their hopes of sharing the pitch together again. Three days before McLeod's death, they featured in their first and only game together when starting in an FA Trophy win at South Shields.\n\n\"That game on the Saturday, before unfortunately he passed, was special,\" added Matheson. \"We had countless conversations joking, saying 'this is our last injury' because we've had so many together.\n\n\"To finally both be starting a game, something knowing just between us that we both strived towards after spending hours and hours in the gym getting each other better, pushing each other, fighting to get back from some horrible injuries, it meant the world to me. That we actually got to achieve that goal we spoke about one last time.\"\n\nIn a touching tribute, external to McLeod after his death, Matheson vowed to carry his legacy forward.\n\nHe is finally injury-free and getting regular minutes for Macclesfield and Monday's game is another chance for him to add to his unique footballing story.\n\n\"It would mean the world,\" Matheson said of repeating his Old Trafford heroics.\n\n\"You can feel the buzz around the town. Everyone has got the Macclesfield badge on. You see it when we're driving to the stadium, people walking their dog with the half-and-half scarves and their hats.\n\n\"To give back to the fans of this town is the proudest thing you can do as a footballer. For us to be able to give them moments like the Palace game and then another against Brentford brings us such joy as players.\n\n\"As cliché as it sounds, it's like a family. You see the stadium packed out and as a player it's what you dream of. We can't wait to get back out there.\"\n\n'They were in their kits behind the bar pouring their own pints'\n\n'Macclesfield's FA cup triumph will last for ever'\n\nGuehi and Glasner 'had big disagreement' during defeat by Macclesfield",

    "fullText": "Team GB's Niall Treacy suffered his third crash in as many short track speed skating events as his Winter Olympics ended when he failed to progress from the 500m heats.\n\nThe only British representative in short track, Treacy surprisingly reached the 1500m final on Saturday but crashed out and then also fell in the 1,000m heats.\n\nThe 25-year-old says the shortest distance is his least favourite, declaring himself to be \"not a natural sprinter\".\n\nTreacy had a wobbly start as he was clipped on the opening corner by South Korea's Rim Jong-un - an 18-year-old high school student who won bronze in the 1,000m - to require a restart.\n\nBut there was no reprieve for Treacy, as he skidded out midway through the full race under no pressure.\n\nIt ends British interest in short track, and the sport has struggled since losing £4.8m in UK Sport funding after failing to win a medal at PyeongChang 2018.\n\nGB sent a team of five to short track events eight years ago - but that is down to one in Milan.\n\nDutchman Jens van'T Wout, who has already won both the 1,000m and 1500m, remains in the hunt for a golden treble after avoiding a mass pile-up to win his heat.\n\nThe remainder of the 500m competition - with two further knock-out rounds before the final - takes place on Tuesday.\n\nTeam GB's women curlers delivered their best stuff in the biggest moment as they beat Denmark 7-2 to keep alive their semi-final hopes at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nHaving lost three of their opening four matches, Rebecca Morrison's rink woke up on Monday not just in northern Italy but also in must-win territory.\n\nRealistically, they need victories in at least four of their final five matches to have any chance of salvaging a place in Friday's last four - and they began that quest well.\n\nAn aggressive start was rewarded with an early 2-0 advantage and the British rink maintained that to lead 3-2 at the break.\n\nAnother fine two-point haul in the sixth, followed by a steal in the seventh, opened up a four-point gap with three ends to play.\n\nThe Scottish quartet managed the rest of the contest admirably to close out the game with two ends to spare and add to their previous win over world champions Canada.\n\nThe women are back on the ice against the Swiss at 18:05 GMT, but before then the men resume their round-robin campaign against Norway at 13:05.\n\nBruce Mouat's world champions have won four of their opening six games - having lost to unbeaten Switzerland in an epic on Sunday - but know a couple more victories in their final three matches should see them through to the last four.\n\nBritish two-man bobsleigh team Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence suffered a disappointing start to their Olympic campaign - now sitting eighth at the halfway point of the competition.\n\nTheir combined time of 1:51:54 after two heats leaves them 1.64 seconds off the pace of German team Johannes Lochner and Georg Fleischhauer in top spot with two more German teams occupying the other podium places before Tuesday's medal-deciding runs.\n\nHall and Lawrence, who is a serving Royal Marine, were unable to improve on their run-one position after a heavy bump near the top of the track on their second heat led to more errors and a struggle to make up time.\n\nPilot Hall will also lead the charge for a medal in the four-man event later this week. while Germany's Francesco Friedrich, who is currently third, is aiming to do the treble double - win two and four-man gold for the third Games in a row.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table",

Austin was a fearless leader, a gracious man, a devoted father and husband, and a faithful follower of Christ …Austin led by example … led by his own actions and words.”\n\nHuskey is survived by his wife, Kat Huskey, and their two children.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told PEOPLE that preliminary information indicates that the circumstances of the plane crash were \"unknown.\" Citing Tennessee business records, The New York Times reported that the aircraft involved in the crash was registered to ALS Aviation, a limited liability company in Franklin.\n\nAccording to flight data, the plane departed Kansas City Downtown Airport just after 10 p.m., for Bob Adams Airport in Steamboat Springs before it crashed southeast of the airport. The plane had flown from Nashville to Kansas City the evening before.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NTSB are investigating the incident.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nPEOPLE has contacted the Routt County Office of the Coroner, Routt County Sheriff's Office, NTSB and FAA for comment but did not immediately receive responses.",

    "title": "5 easy hobbies that give your brain a workout without leaving the sofa",
    "description": "Here are five hobbies you can take up as quickly as today – and they have a variety of potential benefits.",
    "fullText": "Hobbies are a great way to make the most of your leisure time. Studies have shown that people with hobbies aged 65 and over report higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction. And some of the most relaxing pastimes could also benefit your brain health.\n\nThe good news? You don’t need to run a marathon or learn rocket science. From puzzles to knitting and music, there are plenty of sofa-friendly hobbies that could give your brain a meaningful workout.\n\nThat’s because, when we learn or practise a skill, the brain forms and strengthens neural connections through a process known as neuroplasticity.\n\nThis allows the brain to reorganise itself, adapt to new challenges and maintain cognitive flexibility. Over time, mentally stimulating activities are associated with better memory, sharper thinking and, in some cases, a reduced risk of cognitive decline.\n\nJigsaw puzzles surged in popularity during the COVID lockdowns – and their appeal hasn't faded. Research shows that around a third of UK adults regularly engage in the hobby on a weekly basis.\n\nPuzzles are an enjoyable pastime for all ages. Better yet, research suggests they may benefit the brain. A 2018 study published in Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience found that people who regularly completed jigsaw puzzles showed better visuospatial cognition – the mental ability to understand spatial relationships between objects.\n\nResearchers also state that frequent puzzle-solving may help build “cognitive reserve”, which could help the brain better cope with age-related changes.\n\nMay help build cognitive reserve linked to lower dementia risk\n\nImproves visuospatial cognitive abilities\n\nEncourage problem-solving and sustained attention\n\nLong associated with older generations, knitting has experienced a revival in recent years. The UK Hand Knitting Association estimated, in 2022, that around one million people had taken up knitting since the start of the pandemic. Online communities on TikTok and other social platforms have also helped modernise the craft.\n\nKnitting requires coordinated hand movements, pattern recognition and sustained focus. Research published in the British Journal of Occupational Therapy found that knitters frequently report feeling calmer and happier while knitting, with many describing it as meditative.\n\nRepetitive, rhythmic motion may reduce stress hormones, such as cortisol. Lower stress levels are also associated with better long-term brain health.\n\nPromotes neuroplasticity through learning patterns and techniques\n\nImproves fine motor skills and hand–eye coordination\n\nMay lower stress and cortisol levels\n\nEncourages attention span and working memory\n\nWhile it may seem daunting, it's never too late to learn a musical instrument. And it's a hobby you can do from the comfort of your own home, if you so choose.\n\nStudies suggest that musical training engages multiple brain regions simultaneously, including those responsible for memory, motor control, auditory processing and executive function. A 2023 study from researchers at the University of Exeter found that playing a musical instrument was associated with better memory and problem-solving skills in older adults.\n\nIf you don't want to learn an instrument, research has also shown that simply listening to music could reduce your risk of dementia.\n\nSharpens memory and executive function\n\nStrengthens language and listening skills\n\nBoosts mood and emotional well-being\n\nMay help preserve cognitive abilities\n\nThe great thing about singing is you don't have to be particularly good to give it a go – and the benefits are worth it, even if you can't hold a tune. Singing strengthens memory by engaging auditory, motor, emotional and language centres simultaneously, reinforcing neural connections.\n\nFor people living with dementia, singing has been shown to support long-term memory recall and verbal fluency. The Alzheimer’s Society notes that musical memory is often preserved even when other types of memory decline, which is why familiar songs can trigger vivid recollections.\n\nGroup singing has also been linked to improved wellbeing and social connection – both of which are protective factors for cognitive health.\n\nEnhances memory encoding and recall\n\nSupports verbal fluency and word retrieval\n\nMay support heart and lung health through controlled breathing\n\nYou don't need to be the next David Hockney to benefit from picking up a paintbrush. Whether it's watercolours at the kitchen table or sketching in a notebook, being creative can offer measurable benefits for both brain and emotional health.\n\nResearch suggests that making art can help lower levels of cortisol — the body's primary stress hormone. Chronically elevated cortisol has been linked to memory impairment and accelerated cognitive ageing, so reducing stress may play a role in supporting long-term brain health.\n\nA 2016 study published in Art Therapy found that just 45 minutes of creative activity significantly reduced cortisol levels in participants, regardless of their artistic experience.\n\nMay reduce cortisol and stress levels\n\nStrengthens sustained attention and focus\n\nEncourages cognitive flexibility and problem-solving\n\nProvides a sense of achievement and purpose",

    "fullText": "The charger firm claimed the site operated 24 hours a day, but the parking operator had different ideas\n\nI charged my electric car at the 24-hour Mer EV charging station in my local B&Q car park.\n\nI then received a £100 parking charge notice (PCN) from the car park operator, Ocean Parking. It said no parking is allowed on the site between 9pm and 6am.\n\nThere were no signs on the EV charger explaining this, but Ocean has rejected my representation. Mer apologised for the “inconvenience”, but it will not help.\n\nThis is one of the most farcical parking disputes I’ve come across. Mer’s website advertises the EV charger as a 24-hour facility. Signs at the entrance to Redhill retail park state, in large letters, that free parking for up to two hours is allowed. Smaller print beneath this says that terms and conditions apply.\n\nIt’s these terms and conditions that Ocean is relying on, and they are not printed on the entrance signs, or on the sign behind the EV charger.\n\nThe latter notice bears a line, in a tiny font, obscured by the cable frame, advising drivers to check any parking restrictions. These restrictions are detailed on separate signs around the car park.\n\nI began with Mer. It was defensive, insisting that the sign on its charger was adequate, but admitted that the 24-hour promise on its website had caused “confusion”. It has now amended the website. Ocean’s defence was that it had no idea that the charger was in operation until I got in touch, and it had therefore assumed you were merely parking.\n\nThis is unconvincing. You had detailed in your representation that you were using the charger at the time, and Ocean’s rejection letter stated users of the charger are not exempt from parking restrictions.\n\nI jogged Ocean’s memory, but it doubled down. “We maintain that the parking charges were issued correctly under the published conditions,” it said.\n\n“However, given that signage in the immediate charging area only met the minimum standard, and Ocean Parking pride themselves on exceeding that, we have taken a pragmatic and fair‑minded approach: all outstanding PCNs relating to that specific location were cancelled, appeals were upheld, and refunds were offered to motorists who had already paid.”\n\nIn Leicestershire, CH is also caught in the tentacles of a private parking operator after stopping on a road in a business park to drink a cup of coffee. He was slapped with a £100 PCN by Euro Parking Services for parking on “double yellow lines/crosshatched bay” in a “restricted area”. He appealed and was asked to provide evidence that the restrictions were invisibly advertised. So back he went to the site to take photographs.\n\nEPS’s response was to fire off another £100 PCN. The CCTV photos attached to this second PCN show him craning to snap a tiny sign, with tiny print, mounted on a pole at least three metres (10ft) high. The photos also show that there are no yellow lines or hatchings on the road.\n\nEPS is a member of the trade body International Parking Community (IPC), whose code of practice requires signs to be conspicuous and legible. Member firms must also allow drivers a five-minute grace period to check for parking restrictions.\n\nThe sign in EPS’s own photos is manifestly not conspicuous nor legible, and its PCN confirms he was on site for 75 seconds, yet EPS refused to cancel either PCN.\n\nEPS relented over the second charge when I questioned it, but insisted on upholding the first. “We recognise that drivers need to be able to read and, if necessary, photograph signs in order to submit a representation, and it is not our policy to penalise motorists for doing so,” said the firm which had done exactly that\n\nWe are reviewing the signage at this site to ensure that it is clear, legible and appropriately positioned for all drivers,” it said.\n\nCH can appeal to the IPC, but if he loses, he also loses an early payment discount of £40.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.\n\nEmail us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Consumer Champions, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

    "fullText": "Multiple game creators describe ineffective moderation on the platform, resulting in unchecked hatred in forums and targeted campaigns of negative ‘anti-woke’ reviews\n\nFor years, the gaming storefront Steam has let abuse and bigotry pass through its moderation, according to players and developers who use it. The platform is now host to reams of content that violate its own guidelines.\n\nAccording to developers who spoke with the Guardian, abuse – particularly directed towards transgender creators – is a fact of life on the platform. “Everyone is at one another’s throats all the time in reviews, discussions, forums, anywhere you can possibly find it on Steam,” says content creator and Steam curator Bri “BlondePizza” Moore. “It ensures no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike.”\n\nAside from the content of Steam’s forums, sources pointed to two main causes for concern: bigoted reviews posted on games’ Steam pages, which can hugely affect sales for their developers; and Steam curators (self-appointed taste-makers on the platform) directing campaigns against games they perceive to lean left or pursue inclusion.\n\n“I’m not new to online harassment,” says designer Nathalie Lawhead, who spent two years trying to get reviews removed from their games’ pages. Both reference allegations of sexual assault that Lawhead made in 2019. “I assumed reporting Steam abuse might have its own issues. But when people suggested that I open a ticket, I did have hope that this would be the way to get it resolved.”\n\nOne of the reviews, published in 2023, read, “cringe game, made by a liar”. The other, a review of Lawhead’s game Blue Suburbia posted in 2024, said: “A women [sic] who seeks to destroy other’s [sic] career made this. It’s very poorly put together. She also probably has dual Israeli citizenship with how pointy her nose is.”\n\nDespite Steam’s code of online conduct and community guidelines prohibiting “abusive language or insults”, public accusations or “discrimination”, moderators initially cleared both reviews after Lawhead reported them.\n\nSteam does not allow cleared content to be reported again by the same user unless it has been edited. So Lawhead asked others on social media to report the reviews, which prompted Steam to remove the antisemitic example. The other, however, was passed again. “We aren’t in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews,” reads a response from Steam sent on 9 January 2026, “and we don’t try to moderate reviews based on accuracy.” Removing reviews, the response claimed, could be seen as “censorship”.\n\n“Crushing,” is how Lawhead describes Steam’s missive. “The implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it,” they say. “I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It’s an obvious stance. It’s a choice.”\n\nThe remaining review was finally removed, but only after Lawhead personally approached an employee of Steam’s developer, Valve, outside the moderation ecosystem. “This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews,” they say, describing having to resolve the issue outside the usual channels as awkward for both parties. “I think this entire process of moderation is broken.”\n\nWhile Lawhead was able to call on public support to help get reviews removed, that is not an option for every developer: not everyone has enough of a following. Others who have gone public with Steam moderation issues have received further harassment, and have asked to speak anonymously or be identified by their first names only.\n\nSome games have been targeted by Steam curators. Ethan, the developer of Coven, a first-person action-horror set in the 1600s, says he has been targeted by “CharlieTweetsDetected”, a curator devoted to recommending games based solely on whether their developers are perceived to have correctly mourned the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nCharlieTweetsDetected’s review of Coven, a first-person action-horror game set in the 1600s, read simply “Celebrated Sept 10th on blue sky [sic]”. This encouraged others to post further reviews and comments related to Kirk (and not the game). “I even mentioned it to Steam support,” Ethan says, “how it stemmed from that curator list, but they weren’t interested.” Instead, Steam support claimed that “off-topic” constituted “a recipe for cookies, or something completely unrelated to video games that is clearly trolling.” Reviews referencing Kirk, including one reading simply “RIP Charlie Kirk” alongside a negative rating, did not fit that criteria according to Steam; all remain in place today.\n\nElsewhere, campaigns chase games that include trans or LGBTQ+ characters. A trans developer included on a curation list titled “NO WOKE” cites frequent discussion threads, including one that referred to them as a “transvestite” and asked whether their game included “woke faggotry.” Plane Toast’s Émi Lefèvre points to reviews and discussions of Caravan SandWitch, a sci-fi action-adventure and driving game, which frequently approach its queer characters negatively. “Too LBGTQ [sic] … There is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians,” reads one among many that remain visible on the game’s store page.\n\n“For sure, the ‘anti-woke’ curators brought insincere negative attention to the game,” Lefèvre says. “Valve’s refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalised people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought.”\n\nThanks to this influx of bad actors, and the lengths that developers need to go to in the hopes of getting hateful content removed from their pages, often without success, many report feeling held hostage by the platform. Steam has become essential for developers. It brings in millions of daily users – last month it had almost 42 million concurrent players – and billions of dollars. “No other storefront has the clout that Steam does,” Lawhead says. “Publishers don’t take you seriously if you’re not on it.”\n\nThat level of success results in hundreds of thousands of support tickets every week. Details about how Valve, a company that has been reported to employ fewer than 400 people, handles its moderation load are elusive. Online consensus, including among those formerly involved in Steam’s volunteer moderation programme (retired in 2022), is that the process must be outsourced. The Guardian reached out to Valve on multiple occasions, through multiple channels, \n\nDeveloper Phi endured an identical process to Ethan and Lawhead upon releasing Heart of Enya in 2021. After escalating a support ticket over transphobic reviews, Phi received the following response from a Steam agent: “It’s much better to continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed.” (This exact wording was in Steam support’s response to Lawhead five years later.) “Most of our moderating decisions come down to a yes/no criteria … that’s a frustrating line to walk, and I think it inevitably leaves content that would be considered offensive.”\n\nThe agent suggested the issue would be discussed with their team, but after five years little appears to have changed.\n\n“To us, it seemed that in Steam’s [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse – but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that’s welcome speech,” Phi says. “We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They’re still up there today.”\n\nRecourse for developers is limited. Some are looking into their own security, shoring up protections for developers on their team against being doxxed or hacked by trolls. Or, in the case of the developers of Caves of Qud, paying their own moderators to handle forums and the hate that spills out of Steam. Others push bigoted comments into public view in an attempt to cajole Valve, such as No More Robots head Mike Rose, who pushed back against racist reviews of its game Little Rocket Lab last year. “Woke game. Also has muslims,” reads one negative review; “please never, ever play any of our games ever again,” reads Rose’s response.\n\nOthers are just trying to roll with it. “Brown space lesbians trying and failing to contain a simple fungal outbreak” is, despite its original derogatory intent, “the hardest line in all of our marketing copy”, according to Ambrosia Sky developer Christina Pollock.\n\nIt is increasingly easy, however, for the average consumer to log on to Steam and encounter abuse, bigotry and hate, much of which has been cleared by moderators. And because reviews affect a game’s visibility on Steam, a single negative rating can mean the difference between success and failure. Lax moderation doesn’t just create individual harm but has profound professional and economic implications for developers across the platform.\n\nMany of them say they feel forced simply to endure it – unable to walk away from Steam’s near-monopoly on PC gaming. “If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse,” Lawhead concludes. “This shouldn’t be normal.”",

    "description": "Prime minister says outcomes of consultation on social media ban should be implemented quickly as technology minister says Australia-style ban is not inevitable\nIn his Q&A with journalists, Keir Starmer was also asked to respond to a report by the BBC’s James Landale saying he is looking at plans to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP by the end of this parliament. In the past Starmer has just said that he would like to do this at some point in the next parliament.\nIn his reply, Starmer said that at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend he was arguing that the UK, and Europe as a whole, needs to “step up”.\nWe want a just and lasting peace, but that will not extinguish the Russian threat, and we need to be alert to that, because that’s going to affect every single person in this room, every single person in this country, so we need to step up.\nThat means, on defence spending, we need to go faster.",
    "fullText": "At his event this morning Keir Starmer made it clear that the laws on how teens access social media will definitely be tightened. But he said he was “open-minded” about whether this would include a full, Austalian-style ban.\n\nStarmer suggested that one option will be to limit the technology that allows “doomscrolling”. He said:\n\nWe’ve taken the powers to make sure we can act within months, not years.\n\nWe also need to act very quickly, not just of the age concern, but on the devices and applications that make the sort of auto-scrolling, the constant glueing to the machine that you can never stop scrolling.\n\nIn a post on his Substack account, Starmer said out in more details the options that could be implemented as a result of the consultation being carried out. He said:\n\nWe will be going to parliament for new government powers, enabling us to act on the findings of the social media consultation where the evidence suggests we need to. This could include:\n\n-Setting a minimum age limit for social media: unlike the Tories, who took years to pass the Online Safety Act, we will take powers that would allow us to implement a minimum age for social media in a matter of months to prevent kids from accessing harmful social media.\n\n-Restricting specific functionalities: that are detrimental to kids’ wellbeing and keep them hooked to their screens like endless scroll or autoplay\n\n-Limiting VPN access for kids: to make it harder for kids to get around age limits of services or certain functionalities.\n\nThis is all designed to put the wellbeing of children first.",

    "fullText": "Videos created by new Seedance 2.0 generator go viral, including one of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting\n\nByteDance, the Chinese technology company behind TikTok, has said it will restrain its AI video-making tool, after threats of legal action from Disney and a backlash from other media businesses, according to reports.\n\nThe AI video generator Seedance 2.0, released last week, has spooked Hollywood as users create realistic clips of movie stars and superheroes with just a short text prompt.\n\nSeveral big Hollywood studios have accused the tool of copyright infringement.\n\nOn Friday, Walt Disney reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance which accused it of supplying Seedance with a “pirated library” of the studio’s characters, including those from Marvel and Star Wars, according to the US news outlet Axios.\n\nDisney’s lawyers claimed that ByteDance committed a “virtual smash-and-grab” of their intellectual property, according to a report from the BBC.\n\nHowever, the TikTok owner told the BBC it “respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0”.\n\nA spokesperson for the company told the broadcaster it was “taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users”, but declined to provide further details on its plans.\n\nSeedance can generate videos based on just a few lines of text. Last week, Rhett Reese, the co-writer of Deadpool & Wolverine, Zombieland and Now You See Me: Now You Don’t, said “it’s likely over for us” after watching a widely disseminated AI-generated clip featuring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting.\n\nHe added: “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases. True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”\n\nThe first iteration of Seedance launched in June last year.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association, the Hollywood trade association that represents studios such as Paramount, Warner Bros and Netflix, accused ByteDance of “unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”. The actors’ union Sag-Aftra has accused Seedance of “blatant infringement”.\n\nIt is the latest clash in Hollywood amid anxiety over the impact of AI on the future of entertainment. Artists and creative industries have called for compensation for the use of their material and the establishment of licensing frameworks to enable legal use of their content.\n\nLast year, Disney and NBCUniversal sued the AI image generator Midjourney over what the studios claimed were “endless unauthorised copies” of their works.\n\nHowever, creative companies are also making deals with AI businesses. Last year, Disney announced a $1bn equity investment in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and a three-year licensing agreement that enables its Sora video generation tool to use some of Disney’s characters.\n\nByteDance and Walt Disney were approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "Braves reportedly attempting to outbid Mets, Phillies, Padres for $38M All-Star amid injury news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are in a tough spot when it comes to starting pitching, just one year removed from battling the injury bug throughout the entire season. The most recent blow to the rotation came Sunday, when the Braves announced that Hurston Waldrep is undergoing testing due to arm discomfort.\n\n“The Atlanta Braves' rotation took another hit Sunday when manager Walt Weiss said right-hander Hurston Waldrep may need surgery to remove \"loose bodies\" found in his arm. Waldrep complained of discomfort after throwing batting practice. Weiss said an MRI showed no ligament damage, but the team is waiting to learn more after Waldrep has additional tests,” ESPN wrote.\n\nThe injury concerns began on the first day of Spring Training, when Spencer Schwellenbach announced he would start the season on the 60-day injured list. It was not the start anyone in the Braves organization was hoping for.\n\n“The Braves opened camp this morning with an unwelcome update on talented young righty Spencer Schwellenbach. He’s been placed on the 60-day injured list due to inflammation in his right elbow, per Mark Bowman of MLB.com. The team’s hope is that the 25-year-old is dealing with bone spurs and not something more nefarious,” MLB Trade Rumors’ Steve Adams wrote.\n\nWith these injuries already piling up, the Braves are now trying to make one last push for Lucas Giolito, one of the final remaining starters in free agency.\n\n“Per league sources, Lucas Giolito’s market is gaining momentum toward a deal, likely this week. Atlanta and San Diego Padres have intensified their pursuit and moved to the forefront of discussions. The Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets have also remained in contact dating back to the Winter Meetings,” MLB reporter Julian Scott wrote.\n\nThe Braves appear to be going all-in on Giolito following the recent injury news involving Schwellenbach and Waldrep. Atlanta needs to land a starting pitcher who is at least somewhat appealing on the current market.\n\nTension is already building in Atlanta. If a move isn’t made quickly, the season could be in jeopardy before it even begins. And if the Braves continue to strike out, they may be forced to roll with what they have until the season progresses.",

    "fullText": "Heat’s Norman Powell recalls his disbelief over first moment with DeMar DeRozan appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nMiami Heat guard Norman Powell completed another personal milestone after playing in his first-ever All-Star Game on Sunday.\n\nHe suited up for Team World in the mini-tournament, losing both of their assignments in the round robin and failing to advance to the final. In two games, Powell, who has Jamaican heritage, went scoreless against Team Stars before contributing five points, two rebounds, and one assist versus Team Stripes.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, it was a memorable evening for Powell, who is enjoying a breakout campaign with the Heat. He has truly come a long way, starting as a bench player for the Toronto Raptors in 2015.\n\nThe 32-year-old shooter even recalled being in disbelief over working out with then-Raptors star DeMar DeRozan for the first time at UCLA after being drafted.\n\n“Just because being a So Cal (Southern California) kid, knowing everything DeMar did at Compton, watching his highlight videos when I was in high school, so sharing a court with him, working out with him, playing one-on-one, it was one of those moments,” said Powell in a video posted by The Score.\n\n“After we were done, I called my boys, like, ‘Yeah, I just got a workout with DeMar, I just scored on him.’ So that’s probably my first moment of ‘Man, I can’t believe it.'”\n\nNorman Powell couldn't believe he got to work out with DeMar DeRozan before he was drafted: \"I called my boys after like 'I just got a work out in with DeMar and I scored on him.\" ❤️\n\nPresented by @TangerineBank pic.twitter.com/mR2sN5RkSF\n\n— theScore (@theScore) February 15, 2026\n\nPowell lived out his childhood dream, being teammates with DeRozan for four years before the latter was traded to the San Antonio Spurs, along with Jakob Poeltl and a first-round pick, in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.\n\nWhile Powell was sad to see his idol go, Leonard led the Raptors to the championship in 2019.\n\nNow that he and DeRozan, who is now with the Sacramento Kings, are at different stages of their careers, it is great to hear Powell looking back at his humble beginnings.",

    "description": "GM is used to giving out contracts, but now he is looking for one of his own.",
    "fullText": "Speculation about a contract extension for San Diego Padres President of Baseball Operations and General Manager A.J. Preller has been persistent this offseason. Multiple reports have stated that a deal between Preller and the Padres would be forthcoming but to this point nothing is done as of the team’s first full squad workout of Spring Training, Sunday.\n\nPreller is entering the final year of his contract, making him a “lame duck” general manager. Questions about his future with the organization are to be expected but so far remain unanswered. Padres CEO Erik Greupner spoke with Ben Higgins and Steven Woods of “Ben and Woods” on 97.3 The Fan in October of 2025 about an extension for Preller.\n\n“It’s always been the plan that the discussions around an extension for A.J. would take place at the beginning of the offseason as part of our review and evaluation,” Greupner said. “So those discussions have begun and we’re optimistic that A.J. will be our president of baseball operations past 2026.”\n\nNow that February has arrived, Spring Training has begun and Preller still does not have a contract extension, the questions about his future with the team are becoming more prevalent and players are being asked for their thoughts on the situation. Manny Machado, who Preller brought to San Diego as a free agent in 2019, praised Preller and the work he has done with the Padres, adding his lack of an extension is “weird.”\n\n“Yeah, it’s kind of weird,” Machado said. “They’ve been saying they’ve been working on it. Obviously, there’s a lot going on right now with the organization, but I think they’ll figure it out. At the end of the day, we all know the value of A.J. in this organization.”\n\nIt certainly cannot hurt Preller’s case for an extension if one of the locker room leaders who is connected to the team for the foreseeable future speaks on his behalf. To Preller’s credit, according to a social media post from Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union Tribune, when Preller was asked about Machado’s comments he said, “You give out a $300 million contract, usually you get those kinds of comments.”\n\nPreller had the backing of another prominent player well before the media scrums on Sunday. Michael King who re-signed with the Padres in the offseason after testing the free agent market credited Preller for his desire to return to San Diego.\n\n“I’d say the main reason I signed back here was because of Preller,” King said at Padres FanFest in January. “Knowing him as a GM, I know he is going to put a winning team out there every time I’m a part of this contract. I wanted to win throughout the duration of it, and I have the trust in him to do that.”\n\nMachado had similar sentiments to King about Preller and his ability to put together a roster, and for good reason. Preller has been the architect of the most successful run in franchise history, which has included trips to the playoffs in four of the last six seasons.\n\n“We do what we can with the team and he does his best,” Machado said. “Obviously, it’s been successful the last two years with what we’ve had to navigate. This year is nothing different.\n\n“He’s made three moves (Saturday) in a matter of 24 hours and made our team drastically better and he’s going to continue to do that,” Machado added.\n\nPreller has been one of the most active and aggressive general managers in baseball during his time in San Diego. He has shown a willingness to trade from the roster and the minor league system to acquire current players like Fernando Tatis Jr., Joe Musgrove, Yu Darvish, Jason Adam, Jake Cronenworth and more recently Mason Miller. He traded for players who have left the organization like Blake Snell, Juan Soto, Josh Hader, Dylan Cease and Luis Arraez. Not all the trades have gone in favor of San Diego, but each one has kept the Padres in the discussion of a team competing for a World Series championship.\n\n“I think we all know that and we all have faith in him and know that he’s gonna want the best for this organization, the best for this team and he’s gonna try to put the best team out there to go out there and give us the best opportunity to win a championship,” Machado said Sunday.\n\nPreller has also spent money, and this is an area where the part of the fanbase that was not upset about trading away prospects and potential, tends to stand up and make its voice heard. Preller initially signed Machado and then extended him for 11 years at $350 million, keeping him with the team until 2033. Preller extended Tatis Jr. on a 14-year $340 million deal in 2021 and Cronenworth on a seven-year, $80 million deal in April of 2023. Preller extended Jackson Merrill in 2025 with a nine-year, $135 million deal and gave shortstop Xander Bogaerts $280 million over 11 years in free agency in 2023.\n\nNot all these contracts looked good at the time they were given out and some still do not look very good today. However, this offseason has shown the cost for star-level major league players is climbing rapidly and the contracts like the ones given to Cronenworth or Bogaerts may look better from one year to the next moving forward.\n\nThe farm system is depleted because of multiple trades over the past couple of seasons, but Preller has shown the ability to scout, identify and acquire talent that allows him to continue to make deadline deals year after year.\n\nDepending on what you read or hear, the San Diego fanbase seems divided about Preller’s future with the Padres. He has his supporters and he has people who would happily pack his bags if it meant he could leave town faster. Preller has said he wants to be in San Diego, and the players seem to want him, too. Sooner or later a deal for Preller needs to get done and if it is not with the Padres, there is little doubt another team would not jump at the chance to bring him into their organization.",

    "fullText": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s rise in the NBA has unfolded in real time. When he entered the league in 2018, few viewed him as a future MVP. Yet he reached that level and captured a championship with the Oklahoma City Thunder along the way. Today, he is firmly among the league’s elite, and a major reason for that is the confidence with which he carries himself on and off the court.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was one of the starters in the All-Star game this weekend, where he spoke about his mindset. Now, there will be people chiming in and calling him a “foul baiter”, but his talent cannot be denied. In late game moments when the whole team appears to be nervous and rushing to get points, he remains calm, and that actually works.\n\nThe Thunder star is firmly of the belief that what happens today doesn’t matter tomorrow. So, in his mind, the only thing he cares about his getting better with each passing day.\n\nSpeaking about his style of play, the Canadian said, “I have the utmost confidence in my game. Everybody’s trying to speed it up. And I’m not Usain Bolt.”\n\nGilgeous-Alexander hasn’t been in many losing situations over the last two years, and when he has, he’s helped the Thunder wiggle its way out on several occasions. In “within ten-points” situations in the 2025-26 season, the Thunder have had a winning percentage of >85%. That shows that they rarely panic, and SGA being on the floor genuinely helps with that.\n\n“I’m not about to outrun anybody. I gotta slow down. It’s that simple. You run fast, I go slow,” Gilgeous-Alexander added.\n\nSGA is once again one of the favorites to win MVP this season. He is averaging 31.8 points, a stat line that, halfway through the regular season, highlights just how consistently dominant he has been. The Thunderas a whole have struggled a bit lately, with them losing the “#1 record in the NBA bragging rights” to the Detroit Pistons right before the All-Star break. They’re 42-14 and 5-5 in their last 10 games.\n\nThe Thunder have to improve, of course, but SGA needs to keep doing what he always does: be calm, believe in himself, and score points. It’s what makes him a front-runner for the best player in the league award.\n\nThe post Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Explains How “Utmost Confidence” in His Game Is Key to Late-Game Poise appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Ryan Blaney was not a fan of how the Toyota drivers raced in the Daytona 500 on Sunday. They employed aggressive fuel-saving tactics, but that was not his main issue. Instead, Blaney took exception to the way they ran three-wide and effectively blocked the entire field while slowing the pace to save fuel.\n\nBlaney’s call for action drew responses from within the Toyota camp, including 23XI Racing owner Denny Hamlin. Tyler Reddick’s crew chief, Billy Scott, also weighed in after a successful day for the team. With Reddick capturing the Harley J. Earl Trophy and opening the season on a high note, Scott made it clear he saw nothing wrong with the Toyota drivers’ approach.\n\nScott explained his stance, “I doubt there’s a fix to it because we’re just going to figure out the next way to exploit it, and I don’t know that it needs to be fixed. I think we all, as competitors, are spending as much time trying to figure out what the next best thing is and how to combat what the other is doing. I mean, I think it would be like asking if you need to change how chess is played.”\n\nScottbelieves that such tactics are what make the sport interesting to watch and be a part of. Blaneyis certainly not going to agree with that. Hamlin, the senior-most Toyota driver on the field, expressed his thoughts on the matter as well. Unlike Scott, he recognized fuel-saving methods as an issue and delved into what the solution for them could be.\n\nIn light of the situation, Hamlin, once again, explained that increasing the speed of the car is the only fix. He strongly believes that doing so will spread the field and resolve what Blaney and the others are worried about. He further went a step ahead and proposed an experiment that NASCAR ought to try soon.\n\n“One of the suggestions that we talked about just a few days ago is to come here next year in the Clash,” he said. “Let a few of us come up with a package that we think you won’t see any fuel saving, you’re just going to see people hanging on. That would be the only fix.” Increasing the speed limits of the engines means the sport will become more like it was in the past.\n\nThe fans will love that for sure. But NASCAR’s safety department and insurance companies will dread the outcome.\n\nThe post Denny Hamlin and Billy Scott Give Harsh Reality Check on Ryan Blaney’s Demand to Fix Superspeedway Racing appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "1 hot 103-win Big Ten coach Kansas State MBB cannot target after Jerome Tang's firing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCoach Jerome Tang's relationship with the Kansas State Wildcats is no longer, as Sunday night saw the school announce the pair had gone their separate ways, despite only six regular-season games remaining before conference tournament play starts March 10 in Kansas City.\n\nBoth the school and Tang have released statements regarding the situation. The Wildcats' brass intends to fire Tang \"for cause\" and not honor his $18.7 million buyout despite this season's on-court performance potentially being another justifiable reason. The Wildcats (10-15, 1-11 Big 12) have failed to reach the NCAA Tournament under Tang's direction in all but one season of his tenure that began in 2022.\n\nUnder Tang, the Wildcats advanced to the Elite Eight in 2023, but it was never built upon in future seasons.\n\nNow, the program looks for a clean slate.\n\nMORE: Is this freshman class the greatest in college basketball history? Depends how you keep score\n\n\"This was a decision that was made in the best interest of our university and men's basketball program,\" AD Gene Taylor said. \"Recent public comments and conduct, in addition to the program's overall direction, have not aligned with K-State's standards for supporting student-athletes and representing the university. We wish Coach Tang and his family all the best moving forward.\"\n\nTang sees the change differently, though, and personally.\n\n\"I am deeply disappointed with the university’s decision and strongly disagree with the characterization of my termination,\" Tang said. \"I have always acted with integrity and faithfully fulfilled my responsibilities as head coach.\"\n\nTang added he was grateful to those closest to him, but didn't have many kind words for the Wildcats on the way out.\n\n\"I would like to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the opportunity to serve as head coach at Kansas State,\" Tang added. \"It has been one of the great honors of my life. I am grateful to the players, staff, and fans who make this program so special. I remain proud of what we built together and confident that I have always acted in the best interests of the university and our student-athletes.”\n\nAs for who could replace Tang, a few options have already been thrown around by national insiders. But one name in particular, Illinois coach Brad Underwood, has continued to get thrown around nearly once a year in hypothetical coaching cycles as his team's success levels up.\n\nEven though Underwood has Big 12 ties from his days as the coach of the Oklahoma State Cowboys (2016-2017) and his playing and coaching career, which spanned between 1984-2012 with stops at Western Illinois, South Carolina (associate head coach) and Stephen F. Austin, to name a few, a reunion in Manhattan is not possible.\n\nMORE: Big Ten rankings: How Michigan, Nebraska, Illinois, Michigan State, Purdue did in AP Poll\n\nPer the current terms of Underwood's contract with Illinois, a position he has held since before the 2017 season, he can't jump ship even if he were to try to.\n\nIn a quote-tweet responding to Jeff Goodman of The Field of 68, Illini Inquirer's Jeremy Werner set the record straight.\n\n\"1) He has a non-compete clause with all of college basketball. He can't leave. 2) #illini are a top-tier Big Ten program. Why would he leave?\" Werner tweeted.\n\nWerner's second bullet is an opinion rather than a verifiable fact, but he has a point. Illinois went to the Elite Eight in 2024, securing its second Big Ten Tournament title in Underwood's tenure after having done so three years earlier. But unlike the 2021 season, 2024 marked the farthest Illinois has advanced in the tournament since 2004-2005, when it lost the national title game to North Carolina.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, Underwood isn't leaving Champaign anytime soon and has secured 103 Big Ten wins in nearly a decade.\n\nAnd there's still more work to do.\n\nHubert Davis buyout, contract details as UNC Tar Heels coach\n\n'Basketball Saved My Life': Why Master P came home to rebuild New Orleans\n\nBruce Pearl sends warning to NBA teams about Kansas' Darryn Peterson\n\nWhy FOX blocked St. John’s from participating in a major college basketball event\n\nJohn Calipari says college athletics is broken — Here’s his plan to fix It",

Injuries and struggles at the plate have contributed to his demise.\n\nSo, not great news for Salas, who is the Friar’s top international free agent signing at 16 years old for $ 5.6 million. Despite all the uncertainty, the organization invited him to major league camp as a non-roster invitee.\n\nSince his arrival, his offensive production has been disappointing. In three minor league seasons, Salas has a career batting average of .221, accompanied by underwhelming power numbers. He has 58 extra-base hits in 800 minor league at-bats. But what is more alarming is that he struck out in 22.5% of his plate appearances. It is not a bad percentage if you were a proven power-hitter.\n\nLast season, Salas hit .188 in 10 games at Double-A San Antonio. The 19-year-old missed the remainder of the season due to a stress reaction in his lower back. Thus, another lost season in his development.\n\nThe one constant in his up-and-down pro career has been his defense, as Salas is considered one of the top defensive catching prospects in baseball. Scouts have graded him with high marks (70-fielding and 60-arm) on their 20-80 grade scale. It is the reason why Salas is still in conversation as a potential major league call-up candidate.\n\nThe odds are high that Salas will begin the 2026 campaign in the minors. The Padres do not have a spot on the Opening Day roster for him, as all the competitors for the backup catcher role have a proven track record in the majors.\n\nYou can argue that injuries have left him a shell of his former self. But Salas has an opportunity in the major league camp to show he can be productive at the plate and hopefully remain injury-free for the upcoming season.\n\nIt is not impossible to believe the Friars might be inclined to trade Salas before breaking camp. Nevertheless, other clubs may be reluctant to acquire him due to concerns regarding his offensive production. If the market for Salas is lower than expected, then let him develop in the minors. Hopefully, he fulfills his potential and becomes a more complete player.\n\nIt is not impossible to envision Salas turning his career around. He is young enough to improve offensively.\n\nAll the talk is over; Salas must prove he is a potential fixture in a major league lineup. He is at the crossroads of his Padres career; something has to give in 2026.",

Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nIn 1960, the St. Louis Hawks took Bob Sims, a 6-foot-5 guard, in the seventh round of the NBA draft out of Pepperdine University. The Southland native made his league debut during the 1961-62 season as a member of the Lakers, and he appeared in 19 games with them that season, averaging 3.3 points, 1.4 rebounds and 0.6 assists in nine minutes a game.\n\nHis player rights were traded to the Hawks midway through that campaign. Sims exited the league after the 1961-62 season, and he would later play in the American Basketball Association with the Anaheim Amigos during the 1967-68 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 24 — Bob Sims",

    "description": "From a variety of roles, Szoboszlai has reached double figures for the season while looking a worthy inheritor of Steven Gerrard’s No 8 shirt and a future Liverpool captain",
    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah was speaking from a position of experience and expertise. “He is one of the best players in the world right now,” said a man who could have been described in such terms for much of the past decade. Many a Liverpool player in that time has been asked to eulogise about Salah. Now it may have been a sign of a shift in the pecking order at Anfield that he was being invited to praise Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\nSalah did, and willingly. While, when the Egyptian was dropped in November and the Hungarian took his spot on the right wing, they are friends, and when Szoboszlai has borrowed Salah’s yoga-inspired goal celebration against Barnsley, it was an affectionate tribute. Now, in another role reversal, Szoboszlai has outscored Salah.\n\nArne Slot has had his disagreements with Salah this season but, without going quite as far as the winger, said: “I think there are a lot of very good-to-elite football players in the world but I definitely agree with Mo that Dom is one of them.”\n\nA statistic may support that argument. Szoboszlai’s latest all-action display came against Brighton in the FA Cup but this season, only Kylian Mbappe has more goal contributions in the Champions League. He has eight, scoring four, assisting four. There are big contributions among them. Szoboszlai has a late winner against Inter in San Siro. He supplied Alexis Mac Allister for the only goal against Real Madrid. He took the corner for Virgil van Dijk’s injury-time decider against Atletico Madrid. He put Liverpool ahead in Marseille.\n\nNo wonder, then, that Salah said: “This season we rely on him so much.” There had been, however, a temptation to wonder if his status would slip this season, following the arrival of Florian Wirtz. Instead, he has started every Premier or Champions League game this season, apart from when he has been banned. It was evident Slot liked Szoboszlai in his debut year at Anfield; but it was notable, too, that the head coach said that, to play in midfield for Liverpool, you had to score goals. The Hungarian got too few, eight in 49 then.\n\n“When said that I maybe had to add that you need to run a lot if you play in the midfield for Liverpool,” said Slot now. “But I think what I meant was, as a No.10, you need to produce goals.”\n\nWhich Szoboszlai is now doing, but from a variety of roles. He reached double figures for the campaign on Saturday – equalling his best return for RB Leipzig – but the 10th came with a powerful surge from deep as a central midfielder. His spectacular free kicks against Arsenal and Manchester City each came when operating as a right-back. “He hasn’t always played in the No 10 position but is producing more and more goals,” noted Slot.\n\nPart of it stems from his set-piece expertise; so do his assists. Szoboszlai can take free kicks that Salah used to get or corners that, in previous years, would have gone to Trent Alexander-Arnold. He has long struck the ball in a way that exudes class. Now it brings more menace. More excitement, too: when striding forward but outside the box on Saturday, the Liverpool faithful were calling on him to shoot.\n\nWhen he does, he seems to be turning Liverpool’s goal-of-the-season award into a one-man contest. Their player of the year prize had already felt decided: Szoboszlai again. One comparison with Liverpool’s past could be Danny Murphy, their player of 2002-03 but in a disappointing campaign when too many others underachieved.\n\nYet the barnstorming run that brought his goal on Saturday and his ferocious long-range shooting are more reminiscent of perhaps Liverpool’s most iconic captain, who was also no stranger to starring as others struggled. “Actually, I am not playing a Steven Gerrard season although he was a legend for the club,” insisted Szoboszlai. “I try to do my own story.”\n\nEverything in it can revolve around him. He seems to have inherited some of Gerrard’s main-character energy. Szoboszlai has gone into overdrive in 2026. In his last nine games, he has five goals, two assists, one goal given away in ridiculous fashion against Barnsley and one red card. He was man of the match at Arsenal and, had Liverpool held on to their lead against Manchester City, probably would have received the award again. He has looked a worthy inheritor of Gerrard’s No 8 shirt.\n\nHe may yet get his armband. Szoboszlai looks a leader and a path to the captaincy is opening up. Alexander-Arnold left last summer, Andy Robertson may follow this, perhaps Salah too. Virgil van Dijk has 18 months left on his deal and is 34. Szoboszlai seems a possible successor.\n\n“He is still young,” warned Slot. “He has a lot of attributes already, especially when it comes to leading by example. There is still a step to make in terms of leadership, a voice in the dressing room if I compare him to Virgil, which is completely normal. Virgil is 34 and has seen [James] Milner, [Jordan] Henderson and these players, so it’s really good for Dominik that he sees Virgil.”\n\nBut when Salah sees Szoboszlai now, he believes he is watching one of the world’s best players. And that is a sign of what a stunning season the Hungarian is having.",

    "description": "Joe Jon Finley coached for the Sooners for five years, but now finds himself in the Pac-12.",
    "fullText": "Former Oklahoma Sooners tight ends coach Joe Jon Finley was the first coaching staff domino to fall in Norman this offseason, but he's reportedly found a new home, and he'll be coaching in the Pac-12 in 2026. Finley was dismissed by the Sooners on January 1st after five years on the job.\n\nNow, Finley will coach at Texas State as an offensive assistant on head coach G.J. Kinne's staff, according to a report from CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Finley will be working with the quarterbacks in San Marcos, despite having no prior experience coaching the position.\n\nFinley played the tight end position at Oklahoma from 2004 to 2007, and he had an excellent final two seasons for the Sooners. After playing in the NFL from 2008 to 2012, he began his coaching career at Oklahoma and at the high school level. After a stop at Baylor, he began coaching tight ends at both Missouri and Texas A&M.\n\nFinley was the passing game coordinator at Ole Miss in 2020, before former OU head coach Lincoln Riley hired him back to his alma mater to coach his old tight end position. Finley stayed on when head coach Brent Venables took over, working under new offensive coordinator Jeff Lebby in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWhen Lebby, who has a close relationship with Finley, left to become the head man at Mississippi State, Finley was promoted to co-offensive coordinator with Seth Littrell at OU, with Littrell calling the plays. That arrangement lasted just seven games in 2024 before Littrell was fired, and Finley was promoted again, this time to play-caller. Offensive analyst Kevin Johns would replace Littrell, serving as the interim co-OC and QBs coach, while Finley continued to coach the tight ends.\n\nFinley called the offensive plays for the final six games of the '24 season, and stayed on staff when Ben Arbuckle was hired as the offensive coordinator. However, he was demoted back to only coaching tight ends in 2025. For the past few seasons, Finley's tight ends have been a weak point on the roster, after having early success during his first couple of years back in Norman.\n\nTexas State is set to hire Joe Jon Finley as an offensive assistant, sources tell @CBSSports.\n\nWill work with the team’s QBs. The former NFL tight end was tight ends coach and co-OC at Oklahoma the last five seasons. Was previously pass game coordinator at Ole Miss. pic.twitter.com/eNOlVTzu5w\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) February 15, 2026\n\nFinley has been replaced by new tights ends coach Jason Witten, but he's landed on his feet in a support staff role with the Bobcats, who are joining the new-look Pac-12 this year. This means that all three of Oklahoma's co-offensive coordinators from the 2024 season are now either support staffers or position coaches, with Littrell as the senior offensive analyst at Tennessee, Finley as an offensive assistant working with quarterbacks at Texas State, and Johns working under Lebby at Mississippi State as the quarterbacks coach in Starkville.\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Former Oklahoma Sooners TE coach lands with Pac-12 program",

The Bayern Munich legend is one of the greatest goal scorers in the history of the sport. Surely, he could not be caught. Then a new Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski arrived on the scene and broke it, plundering an incredible 41 goals in 29 games with a goal in the dying embers of the final matchday.\n\nNow it is Harry Kane’s turn to try to break the record. He came fairly close in the first season and fell further behind in his second season. Now in his third, he has 26 goals with 12 games remaining. Could he break the record this season?\n\nAsked about this possibility after a Kane brace led Bayern to a 3-0 win in the Bundesliga against Werder Bremen, head coach Vincent Kompany deflected the question: “I assume that the league title is much more important for him than the record,” he said, as captured by @iMiaSanMia. “But maybe I’m wrong because I was a defender not a striker [laughs]. He’s Harry Kane, he has and will always score goals.”\n\nLewandowski missed 5 games the season he broke the record. Kane has yet to miss a match and will likely need to carry this through the season to have any hope of reaching 42 goals.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have reportedly done the most groundwork, alongside Liverpool, to sign Nottingham Forest centre back, Murillo.\n\nThe Blues have been linked with him quite a few times recently, and it is a name that does not seem to go away suggesting that it could be a serious move that they look to try and pull off.\n\nDoing groundwork on a deal is something that clubs will do all the time, mainly with the agent of the player to make sure that there is an interest on the player side as well, before moving on to negotiate a fee with his club.\n\nMurillo arrives for a Nottingham Forest match. (Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to a report from TEAMtalk this week, Murillo is preparing to leave Nottingham Forest this summer.\n\nHis camp ‘are actively assessing potential landing spots’ right now ahead of the summer window at the end of the season.\n\nThe report goes on to say that Chelsea and Liverpool have done more groundwork on Murillo than any other club over the past 12 months, with both sides even weighing up bids last summer.\n\nChelsea are still looking for a new centre back despite bringing back Mamadou Sarr in the January transfer window, and it appears that Murillo is certainly one name to watch here.\n\nCole Palmer has fired himself into the league’s top players in terms of xG per 90 and goals per 90. A nice rest this weekend gives him an even better platform to perform this weekend when we play Burnley.\n\nChelsea also have been linked with Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. His stats are great, but at his age and price it’s just not a deal we can see happening.",

    "title": "On This Day (16th Feb 1991): Clough’s Final Visit To Roker As A Manager Ends In Defeat",
    "description": "On this day in 1991, former Sunderland striker Brian Clough made his final appearance at Roker Park as a manager.",
    "fullText": "It had been 27 years since Brian Clough had graced the turf at Roker Park as a Sunderland player, but a record of 63 goals in 74 appearances would ensure that on this in 1991, he would receive a hero’s welcome on Wearside.\n\nThe man in charge at Roker at the time was Denis Smith, and he was beginning his fourth season as manager of Sunderland – and perhaps remarkably, it was in the First Division. After taking over from Lawrie McMenemy following relegation to Division Three in the summer of 1987, it had taken Smith only three years to return Sunderland to the top flight for the first time since 1984-85.\n\nThis meteoric rise, however, had been achieved with fortune going in our favour. Sunderland had finished 6th in Division Two the previous season and gained promotion despite defeat in the play-off final thanks to Swindon Town’s financial irregularities.\n\nThe rate of knots at which Denis Smith had dragged the club through the divisions meant that six players who were in the starting XI for Sunderland’s first game in the Third Division in 1987 against Brentford at Griffin Park, also featured in our starting XI for the opening day of the First Division campaign against Norwich City at Carrow Road – John Kay, Reuben Agboola, Gary Bennett, John MacPhail, Gary Owers and Gordon Armstrong – while a seventh, Marco Gabbiadini, had obviously featured prominently in what was at that point our only season in Division Three in the clubs history.\n\nAt our first board meeting after it had been confirmed that we would be replacing Swindon in the First Division, I asked, “what money have you got to strengthen?\n\nAt that meeting my budget for transfer fees was set at £500,000, but I was not given an increase in wage budget. So if I wanted to bring anyone in I would have to prune my existing squad first.\n\nWith the money at his disposal, he signed Kevin Ball in a deal worth £350,000 from Portsmouth in view of John MacPhail’s departure, and Eric Gates was replaced with Peter Davenport from Middlesbrough, who almost broke the bank at £300,000. Despite early promise in the form of an impressive home draw against Tottenham Hotspur, which was backed up by a victory over Manchester United in the space of five days in August, Sunderland remained in the bottom six from September onwards.\n\nIt was clear Denis Smith needed reinforcements for the run-in, and at the beginning of February, the board relented and handed over £225,000 for the manager to spend on Republic of Ireland under-21 international Brian Mooney from Third Division Preston North End.\n\nEvery time I had seen him he had played extremely well and looked really fast, with an ability to go past people, hurting defences. But I have to admit I got this one wrong. John McGrath stitched me up. Mooney was a bad signing. I’d go so far as to say a disaster. He seemed to be carrying an injury that affected his pace and mobility. In short he was a disaster.\n\nSnowstorms had battered England in the week leading up to the game, which was officially given the go-ahead only 48 hours ahead of kick-off. Denis Smith struggled to attend a reserve game at Elland Road to run the rule over Bulgarian international left-back Alexander Markov, who was on trial at Roker from Slavia Sofia. The evidence of the hard work to keep the game on as scheduled could be seen in the piles of snow around the edge of the pitch as the two sides took to the field.\n\nAs well as a debut for Brian Mooney, an injury to Paul Hardyman meant that 19-year-old Anthony Smith was also in the starting line-up for the first time since the end of October, when he experienced a torrid evening as Sunderland went down 6-0 to relegation rivals Derby County in the Rumbelows Cup.\n\nNottingham Forest, who were sitting comfortably in mid-table in the First Division, began the day as favourites, but it was Sunderland who started brightly with Gabbiadini going close early on with a header that was smartly tipped over by Mark Crossley. Gordon Armstrong also made Crossley pull off an impressive save with five minutes of the first half remaining, when he hit a shot from six yards out straight at the Forest keeper.\n\nSunderland finally beat Crossley from the resultant corner to take the lead, when a well-worked set piece resulted in Colin Pascoe finding Kevin Ball at the back post, who headed back across goal for Marco to nod in from close range. It was Gabbiadini’s ninth goal of the season in Division One, but his first goal in ten games.\n\nAt the beginning of the second half, Roy Keane almost set up Phil Starbuck, who saw his shot saved smartly by Tony Norman in the Sunderland goal. Denis Smith’s side could have extended their lead late on as a long ball by Kevin Ball set Gabbiadini free beyond the Forest back four, but brave goalkeeping at the striker’s feet once again saved the day for Clough’s side.\n\nSunderland held on for all three points to pull six points clear of the drop, but despite the fact that only two sides were relegated that year due to the expansion of the top flight to 22 teams, Denis Smith’s side ended up as one of them. Almost doing enough, despite the lack of support for the manager in the transfer market, but fell at the final hurdle against Manchester City in May.\n\nBob Murray accepts that this was a mistake now. More than it was a big error that would eventually destabilise the club and my career, sending both into a wilderness from which neither would recover for some years. If we’d realised the opportunity in 1990 that was there for us to push on then Sunderland could have been amongst the top five or six teams in the country, but we didn’t.\n\nSunderland 1-0 Nottingham Forest\n\nSunderland: Norman, Owers, Bennett, Ball, Smith, Mooney, Bracewell, Armstrong, Pascoe, Davenport, Gabbiadini Substitutes not used: Kay, Atkinson\n\nNottingham Forest: Crossley, Laws, Chettle, Walker, Pearce, Starbuck (Crosby), Keane, Gaynor (Hodge), Parker, Wilson, Clough",

The only thing missing was the guy who is universally considered as the best shooter ever, Steph Curry.\n\nCurry has won the contest twice before (2015 and 2021), but he didn’t participate this year. The rest of the field won’t be so lucky next year though, as Curry vowed to return to compete in the contest in 2027 and bring some friends with him.\n\n\"One hundred percent,\" Curry said of his participation. \"I already scheduled it. We're gonna bring some people.

    "description": "The Lads overcame a stubborn Oxford side to book their place in the next round. What did our writers make of the game?",
    "fullText": "He’s really stepped it up a gear the last month or so and he kept that form up. He didn’t put a foot wrong, pulling the strings and doing his defensive duties well. He gave up the penalty, too, although I’m not 100% sure why.\n\nThe fact that we had him in the Championship last year is becoming more and more baffling each week.\n\nHe’s been poor in his Premier League appearances so far this season, so this was a good chance for him. He showed the ability and talent he has; his little jinking runs brought a lot of joy and he looked really dangerous.\n\nHopefully that gives him a good platform to push on.\n\nIt was a really good, professional performance from the Lads.\n\nIt would’ve been easy to become complacent in the game and I’m glad they didn’t. There’s always a risk of faltering against lower league teams by slowing down to their tempo, but that never happened and everyone played brilliantly.\n\nIt was a tough battle at times with their directness, but we showed good team spirit and got the job done.\n\nWilson Isidor and Eliezer Mayenda were poor and neither of them gave Régis Le Bris nor Brian Brobbey anything to worry or think about.\n\nI’m aware that it must be difficult to have played so much last season and even at the start of this season only to be pushed out of the team, but Brobbey was signed for £20 million and has played really well so he deserves to start.\n\nI love them both but Mayenda and Isidor need to improve and do more.\n\nGiven that we seem to have had a weekend of narrow results against Premier League opposition (Arsenal aside), it was reassuring to see such a controlled performance.\n\nWith our lineup being as strong as it was, we can rest assured that Régis Le Bris is taking the cup seriously and although we only won by a one-goal margin, we dominated in all areas.\n\nHad their goalkeeper not performed as well as he did, we would’ve been looking at a comfortable three or four-goal win.\n\nLike many others, I’ve been bemused to see the amount of ill-advised comments about Mundle over the past few weeks, so it was fantastic to see him attacking their full back from the off.\n\nAt times, he was our strongest threat and I hope that this game will give Mundle the confidence to push on and seize opportunities when they arise.\n\nTo write off one of our own players in a much more challenging league after coming back from a serious injury is nothing short of pathetic, and I hope that Mundle gets his own “Watson-esque” moment to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nFrom not knowing where we’d signed players from to just blatantly spouting rubbish, I don’t think I’ve heard two worse commentators for one of our games for quite some time. Sadly, TNT Sports have a deal with the FA for several more years.\n\nHere’s hoping we get a home draw in the next round, or at the very least, we get some more competent people to work on our game.\n\nWhilst the rise of Brobbey has been something to behold, we do need other players to be available in that position.\n\nFor me, though I suppose you could put it to a lack of service at points. Wilson Isidor did very little to challenge Brobbey for that starting role up front and I was hoping that much like the West Ham home game, this would be the chance for both Isidor and Eliezer Mayenda to get on the scoresheet and show what they’re capable of.\n\nAs things stand, for me personally, there’s a gap in quality between Brobbey and his competitors.",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce made a cheeky reference to his fiancée Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The Kelce brothers showcased their creativity for Valentine’s Day by making cheeky, punny cards. The Chiefs’ tight end made sweet references to Jumanji, his NFL career, and even Swift’s sourdough obsession. However, fans were impressed by Kelce’s witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood” in one of the creatives shared via an Instagram carousel.\n\nTravis Kelce referenced Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The New Heights podcast’s official Instagram account shared a carousel showcasing their wholesome Valentine’s Day greetings. The first slide in the carousel read, “Wood you be my Valentine?” accompanied by an animated tree and Kelce smiling.\n\nFor those who missed it, this is a reference to Swift’s raunchy track “Wood” from her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl. Notably, the global pop star has dedicated the song to her fiancé. The lyrics make a cheeky reference to Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, and his manhood as well. Swift sings, “New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood) / I ain’t gotta knock on wood” (via Page Six).\n\nFans are loving Kelce’s sweet tribute to Swift and lavished praise in the comments section. One fan commented, “Y’all had the opportunity to do the funniest thing and you did! Good job!!!” A second fan wrote, “These are too good,” accompanied by a laughing emoji. A third fan penned, “WOOD YOU BE MY VALENTINE HAHAHAHAHAH 13/13,” accompanied by clapping emojis. Finally, one fan remarked, “The wood one is my fav.”\n\nFans joked that Kelce is redeeming himself after previously not understanding a witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood.” During the Wednesday, January 21, episode of New Heights, Kelce joked that “Taylor’s gonna kill me” for missing a clear reference to Swift’s song “Wood.”\n\nThe post Travis Kelce’s Valentine’s Day Card Comes With Taylor Swift Twist appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Two days before the Monaco-PSG match, in the Champions League playoff first leg, already 10 absentees are to be noted in total, but numerous other players are uncertain, including Ousmane Dembele and Maghnes Akliouche.\n\nPSG and AS Monaco had very different preparations on Friday. While Luis Enrique's men lost 3-1 at Rennes, Sebastien Pocognoli's team won by the same score against FC Nantes with a brace from Simon Adingra, the Ivorian winger recruited this winter by AS Monaco, who will be able to play against PSG Tuesday night.\n\nTwo days before Monaco-PSG, no fewer than 8 players are already confirmed to miss the match due to injury. On the Parisian side, only one player is definitely out: Quentin Ndjantou. The young Parisian midfielder recently underwent thigh surgery and will not play again for several weeks.\n\nUncertainty surrounds several other Parisians, however, starting with Fabian Ruiz and Senny Mayulu, who were ruled out against Rennes on Friday. The Spanish midfielder has been absent since Jan. 20 due to the knee blow he received against Sporting CP, while the young French midfielder felt minor discomfort in his left calf this week. According to Le Parisien, both will be ruled out against Monaco on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to L'Equipe, Ousmane Dembele also came out with minor discomfort against Rennes when he was substituted in the 74th minute by Goncalo Ramos. Minor discomfort that does not seem likely to call his participation in the Monaco match into question, according to Le Parisien. Injured Friday in the shoulder and replaced by Dro Fernandez in the 71st minute, Joao Neves should also be available, according to L'Equipe and Le Parisien, but that remains to be confirmed in the coming hours.\n\nOn the AS Monaco side, the infirmary is full to the brim and three long-term injured players are already confirmed to miss the match as they were completely removed from AS Monaco's UEFA list last week. They are Mohammed Salisu, Takumi Minamino and Paul Pogba. Other players have been injured for some time and will not return on Tuesday: Lukas Hradecky, Eric Dier, Pape Cabral and Kassoum Ouattara.\n\nDuring their win against Nantes, Monaco also lost Maghnes Akliouche to injury in the 41st minute. According to Sebastien Pocognoli, the French international \"was hit muscularly\" after \"a flexion at his hip on a poorly weighted back pass.\" Akliouche was scheduled to undergo medical exams on Saturday and the severity of his potential injury is not yet known, but he is very uncertain about the visit of PSG.\n\nLamine Camara, Lucas Chevalier's best friend (sic), was substituted just past the hour mark after receiving a blow to the Achilles tendon from a Nantes player: \"Concerning Lamine, it's more prevention, because he received a somewhat dangerous tackle that was surprisingly not called. It was the same for Vanderson, Zak' (Denis Zakaria) and Folarin (Balogun), whom we wanted to preserve,\" Monaco's Belgian coach said Friday night, sounding rather reassuring about his Senegalese midfielder.\n\nOften injured this season and absent since Jan. 3, central defender Christian Mawissa has still not resumed group training and while he is not yet officially ruled out for Tuesday, his presence is very uncertain there as well. Monaco did, however, recover last Friday its Spanish attacker Ansu Fati, who is no longer injured and played 30 minutes against Nantes.\n\nAbsentees for Monaco-PSG with two days to go:\n\nInjured (10): Ndjantou, Ruiz, Mayulu, Salisu, Minamino, Pogba, Hradecky, Dier, Cabral, Ouattara.\n\nDoubtful (5): Dembele, Neves, Akliouche, Camara, Mawissa.\n\nRoundtablesports is Free to join!

    "description": "The second weekend of the Six Nations brings redemption for Scotland, an end to England's unbeaten run, another blistering display from France and Ireland facing a serious threat.",
    "fullText": "Redemption for Scotland as they end England's unbeaten run, Ireland squeeze past improving Italy, and can anyone stop France?\n\nHere are the main talking points from an enthralling second round of the Six Nations.\n\nThere were questions asked of Scotland and head coach Gregor Townsend after the opening weekend defeat by Italy but you would struggle to find a more emphatic riposte than their 31-20 victory over England.\n\nScotland started brilliantly and never took their foot off the gas to hand Steve Borthwick's side a first defeat in 13 and improve on their dominant recent record in Calcutta Cup games, having now won six of the past nine.\n\nSpeaking to the Rugby Union Weekly podcast, former Scotland international Johnnie Beattie said: \"This was special. They were humbled last weekend in Rome and this time we had a chance to humble England here and came through.\n\n\"Everything that went wrong last week was righted. We fought and scrapped for everything. It was fully deserved and a comprehensive Calcutta Cup win.\"\n\nBeattie said Scotland always had the capacity to win one-off games against top sides but they needed more consistency.\n\n\"They've had these seminal moments but not put together a consistent run that would put them in a position to compete for a championship,\" he added.\n\n\"It's how consistently can you find ways to beat these top-level opposition and Scotland don't have the answer yet. Can you finish in the top three? There are some huge games. We have to back it up.\"\n\n'Murrayfield pain will make England a better team'\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nEngland went into the game against Scotland looking for a 13th straight win and a first in Edinburgh since 2020, but were unable to cope with Scotland's energy and intensity.\n\nThey lost last week's hat-trick hero Henry Arundell to an early yellow card, which later became a red, and when they threatened to stage a comeback a chargedown on George Ford's drop-goal attempt led to Huw Jones' eighth try against England - the most of any player in the Six Nations era.\n\n\"Scotland were 20 points better not 11. They were comprehensive winners,\" ex-England scrum-half Matt Dawson told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"In the cold light of day England were taken apart from minute one to minute 80. Scotland were miles better.\"\n\nThe loss was England's fourth in their past five Six Nations away matches and Dawson questioned their tactics.\n\n\"For me it wasn't so much about the kicking game. It was like if that's not working what else are you going to do? Scotland had done their homework and defended ferociously and England were getting no change out of it, so what's the tactic?,\" said Dawson.\n\n\"England didn't adjust accordingly. It was a masterclass from the Scotland coaching staff because England were nowhere.\"\n\nFormer England winger Chris Ashton told Rugby Special he felt England looked \"disjointed\" and there had been a \"snowball effect\" as errors mounted up.\n\n\"A lot of it was not being able to handle pressure. It was one thing after another so early in the game. England lost every battle,\" he added.\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\n'I felt guilty' - Tuipulotu says Scotland delivered for Townsend\n\nFrance are the only team still capable of a Grand Slam and the unbeaten Les Bleus put on another masterclass with a 54-12 win over Wales in Cardiff.\n\nIn a blistering display of speed, scything running and joie de vivre, France made 10 line-breaks in the opening 20 minutes on their way to scoring the most points they have ever racked up against Wales, surpassing the 51-0 win at Wembley in 1998.\n\nAn agile and mobile pack, allied with a magical backline playing with total freedom, the blue shirts were like a blur leaving Wales chasing shadows.\n\n\"You look at this France team and think, who stops them? They have it all,\" former Scotland international back row John Barclay told Rugby Special.\n\nAshton said the French side could \"score at will\" and singled out winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey for praise.\n\n\"His all-round game is fantastic, he always seems so confident and does things not many players can,\" he added. \"He's the go-to guy for France.\"\n\nWill anyone stop 'massive favourites' France in Six Nations?\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nThese are tough times to be a Wales fan. The hardest in living memory for a generation who grew up with regular Six Nations success and a team full of stars such as Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\nThere are many issues at play in Welsh rugby, but by any measure, recent results are a complete horror show as Sunday's record loss to France made it 13 consecutive Six Nations defeats and a 10th straight loss at home in the championship.\n\nIt's now 1,072 days since their last Six Nations victory in March 2023 v Italy in Rome and 1,464 days since their last championship win at home against Scotland in February 2022.\n\nIt appears supporters are starting to vote with their feet. The attendance against France was 57,744, making it the lowest ever Six Nations crowd in Cardiff.\n\nBut speaking after the game on BBC One, former captain Warburton was encouraged by some parts of Wales' play and said they need to look at what went well such as the maul defence, line-out and the performance of Eddie James.\n\n\"Some aspects of the game went quite well, they weren't outpowered, they were outclassed with ball handling. There are some positives to take into next week,\" said Warburton.\n\n\"Looking at the small wins, there's no point kicking them when they're down. It has to be how can we get better from this point? Which young players look like they've got the mentality?\n\n\"We're not trying to solve this in one week, we're in this for a couple of years so let's all get tight and every week look for small improvements and move forward.\"\n\nJones said there had \"definitely been green shoots\".\n\n\"The effort was there but it's international rugby and you're going to be judged on results, but it was there from an effort standpoint,\" he added.\n\nEx-England captain Martin Johnson also offered words of encouragement.\n\n\"Wales can always play and score tries, they have good rugby players so you're never that far away and they can sit there thinking they've been smashed at home against a very good French side. But there will be some games coming up where they think we can win this.\"\n\n'Heartbreaking, sad, disgrace' – Wales fans react to state of game\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nWales still rugby nation despite struggles - Tandy\n\nAfter losing to France in the opening round, Andy Farrell's side survived a scare against an improving Italy side fresh from a home victory over Scotland.\n\nIreland have won all 13 home games against Italy in the Six Nations but that 100% record came under serious threat.\n\nAshton told Rugby Special that Italy, who led at half-time, missed a wonderful opportunity to get a first victory in Ireland.\n\n\"It would have been a long 10 days for Ireland so Farrell would have been happy they got the win but Italy missed so many opportunities. They've got to be annoyed they didn't get the win,\" he told Rugby Special.\n\nFarrell has a big decision to make before Saturday's match away at England after a difficult afternoon for starting fly-half Sam Prendergast, who was replaced by Jack Crowley, with the Munster man putting in a strong showing off the bench.\n\n\"It's hard for Ireland right now, they're in a funny place. They want success all the time and it's going to be hard for them at Allianz Stadium,\" Ashton told Rugby Special.\n\nBarclay added: \"They're not quite there but you don't write them off. They've got experienced British and Irish Lions and it's just small tweaks missing.\"\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nI think Crowley starts against England - Murray\n\nItaly captain Lamaro proud perception has changed",

    "fullText": "They are competing on the world stage at the top of their game - but it's not the sport that some spectators are focusing on.\n\nFemale international athletes have told the BBC that they experience \"derogatory\" and \"weird\" online comments about their appearance.\n\nWales and Saracens rugby player Georgia Evans, who was criticised during the Women's World Cup for wearing makeup and styling her hair, said how she played had \"nothing to do with what I look like\".\n\nA 2025 survey by Women in Sport found the number of girls who dreamt of becoming professional athletes had fallen to its lowest level since 2020, which the charity said was because of gender stereotypes.\n\nAt the beginning of her career, Georgia said she received \"derogatory\" comments based on stereotypes including being referred to as a \"butch lesbian\".\n\n\"My sexuality has no bearing on whether I look girly, or whether I'm butch or whatever I present myself to be,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm not going to change who I am,\" she added.\n\n\"So I would still turn up on a game day with my tan done, my nails done, hair, everything.\"\n\nGeorgia said the \"ritual\" of wearing make-up and doing her hair helped her to forget about the cameras filming her every move on the pitch.\n\nBut her experience at the 2025 World Cup tournament in England was overshadowed when she was criticised online for wearing make-up and bows in her hair, with some even suggesting that it was to blame for the team's losses.\n\n\"It wasn't just about the big pink bow in my hair, it was about the makeup that I was wearing, about how I was treating it like a fashion show,\" she said.\n\n\"I've worked my whole life to get to the top of what rugby is, and all of a sudden, that's been called into question because I'm wearing pink bows in my hair.\n\n\"How I play has nothing to do with what I look like.\"\n\nGeorgia issued a statement on social media at the time hitting back at the comments, telling her Instagram followers \"a rugby player is no longer defined by your gender or what you look like\".\n\nShe said people from \"across the world\" sent messages of support.\n\n\"It's the silver lining of those minority of comments that had come out, had caused like a ripple effect of, when I say, hundreds of thousands of people messaging me.\n\n\"Within an hour, I had to actually turn my phone off because I just couldn't cope.\"\n\nFor Olympic gymnast Ruby Evans, how she looks is \"as important\" as the gymnastics itself.\n\n\"If I have a bad makeup day and I have to compete, it's gonna be a bad day,\" she said.\n\nBut when it's a good make-up day, the World Championship silver medallist said: \"It's the best feeling ever.\n\n\"Everything is just like falling into place, I've trained all these weeks, and then everything just goes perfect.\n\n\"Even if it wasn't as perfect, if I look good, I'm like, 'oh, you know, it's okay.\"\n\nRuby said while the majority of the comments she received online were positive, she had notice her appearance being discussed, including a time that she chose not to wear fake tan for a competition.\n\n\"That time I did wear no tan, people noticed it,\" she said.\n\n\"[I] was like oh OK, right, I know people do actually notice how I look.\"\n\n\"Usually some men online can be quite weird,\" she continued.\n\n\"My audience are little girls, so if there is a comment that's a bit [inappropriate] I do delete it, just so the people who actually watch me for gymnastics don't see that side of it.\n\n\"I just want [young girls] to look up to me, I want to be a good role model.\"\n\nDespite 2025 being a landmark year in women's sport, a recent survey by Women in Sport found the number of girls who dreamt of reaching the top in sport had fallen from 38% in 2024 to 23% in 2025.\n\nThat compared to 53% of boys who, when asked, said they dreamt of becoming top sportspeople.\n\nFormer Everton player and Wales international Gwennan Harries said social media had worsened the abuse faced by athletes.\n\nThe Bridgend-born striker, who is now a football commentator and PE teacher, also called for greater visibility of women's sport.\n\n\"The more inspirational women on TV who are showing their talents and succeeding, it'll feed down to the next generation,\" she said.\n\n\"If you don't see it, you can't be it so it's really important that those opportunities across sport are visible and is being publicized regularly with those people being treated well and respected.\"\n\nStill wearing her bright pink bows, Georgia hopes to inspire the next generation of athletes.\n\n\"I liked the idea that these young girls who are probably getting the same comments as I did when I was coming through, you can see that you don't have to change,\" she said.\n\n\"Everybody has their right to look a certain way, be a certain way and the best thing about rugby is like, it's inclusive to every single person.\"\n\nMan claimed girlfriend's death in car was an accident, but forensics revealed the truth\n\nInterest from around the world as 'home of the year' goes up for sale at £4.5m\n\n'You're not always going to like them' - 100 couples reveal

    "fullText": "Former UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman some lofty goals for this year. \"The Nigerian Nightmare\" plans to end 2026 with two UFC titles.\n\n\"2026, we want to say, wow, I can't believe you actually pulled that off and went and not only took one title but took two and walked away, \"Usman told UFC op Eurosport.\n\nUsman, 38, held the UFC welterweight championship from March 2019 until August 2022 successfully defending the title five times. He holds the record for the most consecutive wins in the UFC welterweight division with 15. The first step in his plan is to win back the 170-pound championship. Islam Makhachev currently possesses the welterweight belt.\n\n\"Of course welterweight first because I don't think the other one happens without the welterweight one because it only makes sense. I'm in this division. I'm still there, so why not take that one first,\" he said.\n\n\"I think myself and Islam, Islam is a phenomenal guy, phenomenal champion what he's bee able to do. I just think, as we know, styles make a fight. And I think I'm the most difficult style for him right now, and I think I'm the best test for him because let's be honest, Islam is extremely talented. That last fight he made it look easy because the former champion just, there was a deficit in the game. And that happens to be where I'm strong as well. I think that's a tremendous matchup. I love Islam, but I think I get that title.\"\n\nIf he were able to secure a title fight with Makhachev and defeat him, Usman has been in the octagon with middleweight titleholder Khamzat Chimaev for 15 minutes. The two fought at UFC 294 in October 2023. Usman stepped in a late notice after Chimev's original opponent, Paulo Costa, was forced out of the bout with an elbow injury. Chimaev defeated Usman via majority decision.\n\n\"If I get that (welterweight) title, I think a lot of people wanted to see that rematch with Khamzat. I would love a full camp,\" said Usman. \"It was too short and I've been accustomed to fighting five-round fights.\n\n\"If I was able to get that opportunity again and to actually prepare for a big, strong Khamzat because Khamzat is extremely talented. He's done everything that was asked of him to do. So, he's a good champion, and I think having given that opportunity again I would approach that fight a little different,\" Usman continued.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s hunt for a midfielder has seen them linked with a surprise move for former Carrington graduate Scott McTominay.\n\nThe 29-year-old, who left United in 2024 after spending 22 years on the club’s books, has proven to be a revelation for Napoli.\n\nThe Scotsman guided the Gli Azzurri to the Serie A title last season, netting 13 times in all competitions and registering six assists.\n\nHis form saw him pick up the Serie A MVP award, and also be named as the world’s 18th best footballer in the Ballon d’Or race.\n\nThe Scotland international has not slowed down one bit, scoring 10 times already this season and also notching four assists.\n\nNaturally, his form has attracted several suitors, including his former club. The Napoli ace appears to have unfinished business back in the Premier League.\n\nHowever, as relayed by F365, that dream might not be realised so soon, with the Naples-based club close to agreeing a contract extension with the midfielder.\n\nThey have reportedly offered a new deal which is valid until 2030, with the option to add another year, which would see the former United star receive a wage rise.\n\nThe defending Serie A champions have reportedly received lucrative offers from the Premier League and the Saudi Pro League, prompting them to take action.\n\n“Talks are progressing well for Scott McTominay’s contract extension with Napoli. Offered a new deal until 2030 + option for 2031 and an increase in salary.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“McTominay has already received two important bids from Premier League and Saudi Clubs but his priority is staying.”\n\nIt seems the midfielder’s agent has played a blinder, drumming up interest in his client by name-dropping the 20-time English league champions, and forcing Napoli to offer him a lucrative new deal.\n\nThe truth is United do not need Scott McTominay. What they are crying out for is a deep-lying playmaker to come in and replace Casemiro.\n\nMcTominay was extensively utilised in that position by former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but it was a clear case of misprofiling as his time in Italy and his last season in Manchester have shown.\n\nWhat the former academy graduate is best at is playing closer to goal so as to arrive late into the box to finish off chances, a position currently occupied by Bruno Fernandes. Hopefully, this latest update will end this saga for good.\n\nFeature image Francesco Pecoraro via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The Leasing.com Stadium hosts a historic FA Cup encounter on Monday night as National League North side Macclesfield look to claim another high-profile scalp against Premier League high-flyers Brentford.\n\nThe Silkmen arrive in scintillating form, having secured six wins from their last seven league games while netting a remarkable 22 goals in that span. John Rooney’s side has already etched its name into competition folklore this season by eliminating holders Crystal Palace in the third round—the biggest upset in FA Cup history by league position.\n\nStanding in their way is a Brentford team that has defied preseason expectations to sit seventh in the top flight. Fresh from a hard-fought 1–1 draw with leaders Arsenal on Thursday, the Bees aim to navigate a “trap” fixture and reach the fifth round for only the second time in 19 seasons.\n\nVenue: Leasing.com Stadium, Macclesfield\n\nJohn Rooney remains without star forward Danny Elliott due to a knee injury. Midfielder Josh Kay is also unavailable as he serves a suspension for accumulating yellow cards. The Silkmen will rely on the attacking prowess of D’Mani Mellor, who has scored seven goals in his last seven outings, and former Manchester City prospect Isaac Buckley-Ricketts.\n\nKeith Andrews is expected to rotate his squad following a demanding week in the Premier League. Talisman Igor Thiago is likely to be rested, potentially handing a debut to 19-year-old Kaye Furo. Captain Nathan Collins could return to the starting XI after being an unused substitute in recent matches. Kevin Schade remains sidelined through suspension, while Fábio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries from long-term injuries.\n\nThe Silkmen have turned the Moss Rose into a fortress, taking 33 points from a possible 48 at home this season. Notably, Macclesfield have won three consecutive FA Cup matches this term. If they secure a win tonight, they would be the first team to win four in their debut season (from the first round) since Rangers in 1886. Their attack remains clinical, averaging over three goals per game in their last seven league matches.\n\nThe Bees arrive as heavy favourites but must overcome a difficult non-league test. Notably, top-flight teams have progressed from 26 of 28 FA Cup fourth-round ties against non-league opponents. This is Brentford’s first-ever FA Cup match as a top-flight side against non-league opposition. Despite a demanding schedule, Brentford have shown defensive resilience, keeping a clean sheet in their 2–0 third-round win over Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nMacclesfield Predicted XI: Dearnley; Fensome, Menayese, Heathcote, Lacey; Edmondson, Dawson, Duffy, Buckley-Ricketts; Bughail-Mellor, Mellor\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Valdimarsson; Hickey, Collins, Pinnock, Henry; Yarmolyuk, Henderson, Damsgaard; Donovan, Furo, Nelson\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports 1 and TNT Sports Ultimate.

    "fullText": "Brentford travel to face non-league Macclesfield on Monday night while they aim to avoid becoming the latest victim of the competition’s ultimate giant-killers.\n\nThe Bees moved into the top seven of the Premier League after a string of impressive results, including a recent 1–1 draw against leaders Arsenal. Manager Keith Andrews oversaw a comfortable 2–0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the third round to reach this stage. Notably, there are 122 league places between these two sides. A victory tonight would see Brentford reach the fifth round for only the second time in nearly two decades.\n\nKeith Andrews navigates a demanding schedule that necessitates rotation. Notably, he is likely to name talisman Igor Thiago among the substitutes to preserve fitness. Consequently, 19-year-old Kaye Furo is poised to lead the attack. This could mark his professional debut. Nathan Collins returns to the heart of the defence after a period on the bench. Conversely, Kevin Schade misses out through suspension. Long-term absentees Fábio Carvalho and Josh Dasilva also remain unavailable.\n\nHakon Valdimarsson starts in goal. He provides Caoimhín Kelleher a well-earned rest after recent Premier League heroics. Nathan Collins partners Ethan Pinnock in a formidable central defensive pairing. In midfield, Yehor Yarmolyuk and Jordan Henderson control the tempo alongside Mikkel Damsgaard. Further forward, Romelle Donovan and Reiss Nelson provide the threat from wide areas. Notably, Brentford have never faced non-league opposition as a top-flight side in the FA Cup.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Valdimarsson; Hickey, Collins, Pinnock, Henry; Yarmolyuk, Henderson, Damsgaard; Donovan, Furo, Nelson\n\nThe FA Cup fourth-round tie takes place at the Leasing.com Stadium on Monday, 16 February 2026.

    "description": "Neuer will now be out for at least three weeks for FC Bayern.",
    "fullText": "Unfortunately, it looks like Bayern Munich will have to go without captain Manuel Neuer for a considerable spell as his calf injury sustained in the 3-0 win at Werder Bremen was worse than initially expected. The club has confirmed that the keeper tore a muscle fiber in his left calf after a thorough exam from the club’s medical staff, though during the second half of the match and immediately following the final whistle, it was felt that Jonas Urbig entering the match to start the second half was more of just a precaution from Vincent Kompany.\n\nNow, per information from Sky Germany, Neuer is expected to be sidelined for at least three weeks (via @iMiaSanMia). During his three-week absence, Neuer will miss matches against Eintracht Frankfurt, Borussia Dortmund, and potentially even the matches against Borussia Mönchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen. Jonas Urbig will stand firm in Neuer’s absence, which there can be reassurance with given how solid he has performed when he’s been called upon by Kompany.\n\nSo far this season, Urbig has made a total of eight appearances across all competitions. From those eight matches, seven of them were wins, and only one was a loss; the shock 2-1 home loss to FC Augsburg. Additionally, from those other seven appearances that were wins, Urbig recorded four clean sheets, including the 45 minute shift this past weekend at Werder Bremen. To say the least, Bayern’s keeper situation is in good hands in Neuer’s absence, pun intended.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Former Chelsea defender Jason Cundy believes that Joao Pedro is the ‘most improved’ player under Liam Rosenior so far.\n\nI don’t think there would be many who would disagree with that statement either, even if quite a few of the players have improved a lot under the new Chelsea head coach.\n\nPedro has truly been on fire in the last few weeks, leading the line superbly and coming up with some very important goals too.\n\nChelsea paid £60 million to sign the 24-year-old from Brighton last summer and Pedro has gone on to bag 13 goals already this season. The striker has four goals and four assists in his last five Premier League outings and is really stepping up as the main man up top for Rosenior right now.\n\nJoao Pedro scored his lovely chip against Leeds. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking on talkSPORT, Cundy admitted that he had not expected to see the striker’s growth so quickly since the turn of the year.\n\nCundy said: “I think he’s probably been the most improved. I genuinely feel that his game has developed since Liam has come in. I don’t know whether that’s down to Liam or if it just coincides with Joao Pedro learning how to play that role better. His hold-up play is something I feel that he didn’t quite have because that’s a hard role.\n\n“The number nine up front on your own, that’s a tough job. Players are now trusting him. When that ball goes in, it bounces off… like Frank Lampard used to do with Didier Drogba. That ball goes in, he knows it’s sticking and will time his run. There’s an element of that going on, we look far more fluid. At the moment, Chelsea’s best number nine is Joao Pedro and I wouldn’t have said three months ago that he would be this player. Hats off, he’s really developed. And he runs in behind as well!”\n\nChelsea have reportedly laid down the most groundwork alongside Liverpool to try and sign Nottingham Forest centre back Murillo in the summer transfer window, with the defender now looking to leave his club.\n\nChelsea also have been linked with Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. His stats are great, but at his age and price it’s just not a deal we can see happening.",

    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The lights of the Intuit Dome found him, as they always do.\n\nNot the strobes. Not the pyrotechnics. Not the manufactured glare of Red Panda, mascots and sponsored distractions.\n\nThe real lights. The ones that matter. The ones that follow greatness like paparazzi follow scandal.\n\nKawhi Leonard stood at midcourt, and the Intuit Dome held its breath.\n\nIt had been a weekend of experiments, of round-robin rubrics and compressed clocks, of three teams where two once stood.\n\nThe NBA, in its infinite tinkering, had fractured its showcase into fragments—12-minute bursts, a tournament where mathematics mattered as much as magic.\n\nNBA fans asked for competition. What they initially received was contention.\n\nThen came Victor Wembanyama. Then came De'Aaron Fox. And then, in the third game, when the afternoon had begun to sag under the weight of its own novelty, came Kawhi Leonard.\n\nHe made it must-watch. Leonard made the All-Star game matter, even as it has become a serious point of contention among those who watch.\n\nThe tone arrived early. It arrived tall.\n\nWembanyama set the tone in the first game of the round-robin tournament, and he set it with the casual ferocity of a man who has never learned to pretend.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs' dexterous 7-foot-4ish center—elastic, impossible, a Gumby-esque monument to modern basketball evolution—walked onto the court, and immediately made it clear he hadn't come for the photo ops.\n\nWemby looked to be taking the All-Star Game seriously.\n\nHe's played defense in an All-Star Game.\n\nIn the first round of a made-for-TV tournament that most players treat as a glorified shootaround. He starts off blocking shots and dunking on people. He came to play.\n\n\"I'm matched up on you,\" Wembanyama told Anthony Edwards in the tunnel before they took the court, according to Edwards.\n\nThe Frenchman finished with 14 points, six rebounds and three blocks in that opening tilt, numbers that tell nothing of the story.\n\nWembanyama contested everything. He erased shots that shooters believed were open. He moved like a guard in a center's body, like a thought in physical form, and his teammates—international stars accustomed to the All-Star's polite indifference—followed his lead.\n\n\"It's a game we love, it's a game I personally cherish,\" Wembanyama said. \"Being competitive is the least I can do.\"\n\nThe World team pushed Team Stars to overtime. Edwards scored 13 points, including a game-tying 3 to force the extra session.\n\nScottie Barnes eventually buried a game-winning triple—the first team to five points, because everything about this format required explanation—and Wembanyama stormed to the bench in disgust.\n\nThe same fury he wears in San Antonio when rotations break down, when possessions are wasted, when excellence is betrayed by inattention. He had lost. But he had established the standard.\n\n\"[Wembanyama] set the tone, and it was definitely competitive with all three teams,\" Edwards said. \"He set the tone, man. And it woke me up, for sure. I'm not gonna lie. He came out playing hard, so it's hard not to match that. So, [expletive], that's what happened. Sorry for my language; that's what happened, though.\"\n\nWembanyama's wake-up call reverberated into Game 2, where Team Stripes faced Team Stars with a different energy—veteran American talent against young American talent, experience versus exuberance, the past reaching for the future's throat.\n\nJaylen Brown poured in 11 points for Stripes. Edwards matched him. Cade Cunningham added 11 for Stars. The score tightened, twisted, refused to break.\n\nThe San Antonio guard—Wembanyama's teammate, though they played on opposite sides in this strange format—took possession with seconds remaining and found himself staring at Cade Cunningham.\n\nWhat happened next defied easy description, but let's try:\n\nFox put Cunningham in the popcorn machine.\n\nCrossed him, cooked him, left him standing in a different zip code. The buzzer sounded. The ball floated through the air. The net snapped.\n\nStripes 42, Stars 40. Game over. Fox's dagger was still quivering in the hardwood.\n\nThat's what the fans wanted to see.\n\nCompetition had crashed the party uninvited. And the party was better for it.\n\nThe experimental format—three teams, 12-minute games, a round-robin tournament and a final championship—had actually worked.\n\nPlayers competed. Crowds reacted. The millionaires and billionaires in attendance forgot to check their phones.\n\nThen the Leonard showcase happened.\n\nThe Clippers' forward, added to the All-Star Game as an injury replacement—inserted by commissioner Adam Silver like a late substitution in a play no one expected to succeed—caught fire in ways that defy statistical comprehension.\n\nIn the third game, Leonard nearly outscored Team World in 12 minutes. Kawhi-31, World 45.\n\nThe arithmetic reads like poetry. The performance played like prophecy.\n\nLeonard shot 84 percent from the field to lead Team Stripes to a 48-45 thriller, and he did so with the aesthetic minimalism that has defined his career—no wasted motion, no excess, nothing that did not serve the singular purpose of putting the ball through the hoop and preventing the opponent from doing the same.\n\nEleven for thirteen from the field. Six for seven from three. Three rebounds. Two steals. 84 percent shooting against a Wembanyama—the human eraser, the league's leading shot-blocker, a 7-foot-4 nightmare who tried his best and watched Leonard shoot over him anyway.\n\nHe looked like Kawhi Jordan, and for 12 minutes, the comparison felt not hyperbolic but historical.\n\n\"We were watching it ... like, 'Damn, this guy is killing,'\" Barnes recalled. \"We were just like in awe. In shock, too. When a guy has it going like that, it's special. That's what the people want to see.\"\n\nEdwards, waiting for the final game, approached Leonard with a message delivered through laughter and competitive terror: \"I told him when we walked out for the last game, I said, 'Hey, you need to chill out.'\"\n\nHe did not chill out. He could not. This is not what Kawhi Leonard does.\n\nThe Clippers fans—his fans, his city, his house—chanted MVP as the final seconds bled away.\n\nLeonard received four MVP votes despite losing the tournament, a statistical paradox that captures the essence of his art: individual transcendence in collective defeat, beauty in the losing effort, greatness recognized even when greatness is not enough.\n\nThe postgame podium found Leonard as it always does—measured, monotone, mysteriously compelling.\n\nThe voice, barely rising above a whisper, somehow commands complete attention. The man who eschews social media's circus has mastered the older art of saying everything by saying almost nothing.\n\n\"It's been fun,\" Leonard said. \"They always do a great job, even during our games, of just keeping us locked in and giving us energy throughout the whole 48 minutes. Los Angeles has been great.\"\n\nForty-eight minutes. Leonard spoke of regular-season endurance in a weekend of abbreviated bursts, revealing the mental framework that separates the professional from the performer.\n\nFor him, the All-Star Game was not an exception to be managed but an extension of identity—compete, always; defend, always; remain, always, the version of himself that arrived in Los Angeles as a champion and persists as a standard.\n\n\"Happy that Adam let me in,\" Leonard said, the two-time Finals MVP, requiring permission to participate in a showcase of stars. \"That's what the home crowd wanted to see and I'm glad I was able to do something in that game.\"\n\nSomething. Thirty-one points in twelve minutes is not something.\n\nIt is everything compressed into urgency, the career-long narrative of efficiency taken to its logical extreme.\n\nA reporter asked about reaching \"Flow State\" in front of home fans. Leonard demurred with characteristic indirection: \"It's great, you know. Happy that Adam let me in.\"\n\nThe deflection is the message. The silence is the statement.\n\nWhen another journalist noted that scoring 31 in a regular game is crazy—\"obviously, Klay had the 37 in one quarter, but for you to do it against World All-Stars, does that mean anything different?\"—Leonard responded with the perspective of a man who has seen everything and been impressed by little.\n\n\"No, just having fun out there. Making shots. Obviously, these guys aren't competing at a regular-season schedule game, but it's always fun to go out and compete against those guys. Cherish the court with them. They're all legends, and they're playing great basketball.\"\n\nOn the format—this experimental triptych of teams and timers—Leonard offered the wisdom of a man who has seen basketball's evolution from defense-first grind to offense-only spectacle and back again: \"I think it was good. Didn't really figure it out till we got here. Even as the game is going on, trying to figure out the records, how you play that out, point spread, or what. But I thought it was good. I still think going back to East-West will be great—I think guys will compete still.\"\n\nThe competitors, he suggested, make the competition.\n\nNot the structure. Not the stakes. The will.\n\nWhen I asked the inevitable—\"When you're healthy, are you the best player in the league?\"—Leonard responded with the philosophy that has carried him through injury and triumph, through San Antonio's betrayal and Toronto's redemption, through the Clippers' endless promise and perpetual postponement:\n\n\"It's for you guys. For me, I think it's rotation—every day, every week, because you get guys coming out scoring 50, having great defensive games, and then the next night somebody's not playing well, somebody else is going to shine. So, for me, I think the ranking is just based on you just keeping the hype around the game.\"\n\nHe paused. The room leaned forward.\n\n\"But yeah, I feel like I'm one of the best at when I am playing basketball.\"\n\nOne of the best. The understatement is the point. Humility is the armor.\n\nAnother voice emerged from the presser: \"Kawhi, in that game, obviously you're representing your home court and you're a local guy. Did you have an extra sense of motivation?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I grew up coming up here watching, going to the convention center, seeing stars walk around and dreaming of being here,\" Leonard said. \"I wanted to take the opportunity to play great, and I take advantage of it and go out there and ball. I was happy I was able to do that this year in LA.\"\n\nThe final question turned to the locker room mindset, the pregame conversation about competitiveness after years of criticism.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Leonard said. \"We didn't really mention not playing hard or let's make this competitive. I didn't hear anything. We just went out there and competed. We wanted to win the game. We got competitors out there, and we got some championship pedigree. It's hard to turn off that switch when you're out there playing.\"\n\nThe championship game—Team Stars versus Team Stripes arrived as anticlimax.\n\nThe young Americans won 47-21, a blowout that rendered the tournament's mathematics moot.\n\nEdwards scored eight points on 3-for-5 shooting and collected his trophy, receiving 10 of 14 MVP votes. Leonard managed one point on 0-for-4 shooting, his body perhaps reminding him that even machines require maintenance, that 31 points in 12 minutes extracts its tax.\n\nIt didn't matter. The damage was done. The statement was made.\n\nKevin Durant, who has seen every iteration of All-Star weekend over two decades, delivered the verdict.\n\n\"I think it was definitely a step up in the competitive department compared to last season. Kawhi was great. Ant was great. I think we did what we're supposed to do for the fans,\" Durant said.\n\nWhat they were supposed to do. The phrase carries weight.\n\nFor too many All-Star weekends, the obligation has been entertainment without effort, spectacle without stakes.\n\nSunday in Inglewood offered something rarer: the genuine article, the unscripted collision of wills, the reminder that even in exhibition, excellence insists upon itself.\n\nWembanyama began it. Fox complicated it. Leonard, in the third game, when the afternoon had begun to drift toward irrelevance, made it must-watch—made it matter, made it memorable.\n\nEdwards, asked postgame about the format, credited the Frenchman who started everything.\n\n\"I think it makes us compete because it's only 12-minute games, and the three different teams separate the guys. I think it was really good,\" Edwards said.\n\nLeonard, asked whether the new format should stay, offered a diplomat's answer.\n\n\"Whatever you guys want. Whatever grabs the attention of the consumer, I'm for it,\" Leonard said.\n\nBut pressed again on returning to tradition, he allowed a small concession.\n\n\"I still think going back to East-West will be great. I think guys will compete still,\" Leonard said.\n\nMaybe Wembanyama's example—his refusal to treat All-Star minutes as downtime, his insistence on playing defense in a game designed for offense—will linger.\n\nPerhaps Fox's dagger, Leonard's clinic, and Edwards's Kobe Bryanttrophy will combine into something lasting, something more than a one-year experiment that worked despite everyone's expectations.\n\nOr maybe it was just one afternoon. One 12-minute window where a quiet superstar reminded everyone what he looks like when the switch flips.\n\nThe lights found him, as they always do.\n\nNot the strobes. Not the pyrotechnics. Not the manufactured glare of halftime shows and sponsored distractions.\n\nThe real lights. The ones that matter. The ones that follow greatness like memory follows meaning.\n\nKawhi Leonard stood at midcourt, and the Intuit Dome held its breath.\n\nFor 12 minutes, he kept it from falling.\n\nMade it forget the compressed clocks, the sordid recent history of All-Star Weekned and the round-robin confusion. Made it remember why we watch, why we care, why a game played by millionaires in February can still feel like the only thing in the world worth seeing.\n\nFor the first time in years, the game itself felt like enough.",

    "description": "OKC Thunder forward Chet Holmgren made his first NBA All-Star Game appearance on Sunday, and he helped his team win a tournament title.",
    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, CA — The sound of a television could be heard from a hallway inside Intuit Dome on Sunday night.\n\nIt came from a small visitors' locker room, where the USA Stars team was watching a broadcast of the NBA All-Star Game's round-robin tournament. The USA Stripes and World teams were facing off, and the outcome would decide if the Stars advanced to the championship round.\n\nTyrese Maxey drank some \"Cool Blue\" Gatorade on one side of the room. Jalen Johnson ate some chicken tenders from concessions on the other. And in the center was Chet Holmgren, who only wanted to feast his eyes on the TV and see if his first career All-Star appearance would continue.\n\n\"I think that's the one thing that's tough about having a three-team, team-off-and-team-on thing,\" Holmgren said of the event's new tournament format. \"We went back in the locker room for like 20 or 30 minutes while the other two teams were playing. We were kind of just chilling, sitting there and watching it.\"\n\nNBA All-Star Game highlights: Chet Holmgren, USA Stars win championship\n\nFortunately, Holmgren's night wasn't over. The World team lost, sending the Stars to the championship round thanks to a head-to-head tiebreaker. They then secured the title by earning a dominant 47-21 win over the Stripes.\n\nThe Thunder big man came off the bench during all three of his team's 12-minute games. It's a feeling that's unfamiliar to the 23-year-old pro, who has always been one of the brightest stars on every court he's touched.\n\nBut Holmgren stayed true to his usual brand of basketball, impacting the game on both ends while playing within the team. He racked up eight points, two rebounds and a game-high two blocks on 3-for-4 shooting from the field during the title game. And he did so in only six minutes.\n\n\"I think it was great,\" Holmgren said. \"Before, I didn't really know how it was supposed to go because I'd never gone through it. I was just kind of trying to feel out the game and play accordingly, and I think it went well. It was fun. ... I played a good brand of basketball.\"\n\nSunday's tournament isn't the biggest stage Holmgren has stepped onto. He helped OKC win its first NBA championship in franchise history last season, after all.\n\nStill, Holmgren couldn't help but to appreciate his surroundings as he got some 3s up during shootaround.\n\nStars such as Minnesota's Anthony Edwards and Detroit's Cade Cunningham are usually on the other end of the court. The side that's enemy territory. But they were right next to him this time, letting it fly and doing some pregame stretches.\n\nMore: Chet Holmgren's path to NBA All-Star Game began with bold claim and channeled ambition\n\n\"I just tried to take a moment to reflect on how cool of an opportunity this is,\" Holmgren said. \"I felt like I was pretty in the moment for the most part, just taking everything in.\"\n\nHolmgren took in plenty of other cool moments throughout the weekend.\n\nHe attended a Foot Locker event on Friday, where he held a sit-down interview and a meet-and-greet with fans. He participated in the Shooting Stars competition on Saturday, where he teamed up with Toronto's Scottie Barnes and former NBA player Richard Hamilton. And he even received a ring before Sunday's tournament to commemorate his All-Star selection.\n\nHolmgren says he didn't even know that last part was going to happen. But he'll happily add it to his growing collection of hardware.\n\n\"It's pretty sick, but I think I like our ring from last summer a little bit more,\" Holmgren said with a smirk.\n\nMore: OKC Thunder's Jared McCain responds to Jason Williams' criticism: 'Get to know me'\n\nJustin Martinez covers the Thunder and NBA for The Oklahoman.

    "fullText": "Manchester United have made an impressive start to 2026.\n\nThey have won seven matches in a row across four different competitions. The latest was an edgy 2-1 win over the London City Lionesses.\n\nManager Marc Skinner spoke to The BBC after the match and outlined his joy at his side winning ugly.\n\nCommenting on the result, he said, “to use a Manchester term, I’m absolutely buzzing. I’m so happy for the team and everyone behind the scenes, but particularly the players.”\n\nThe head coach also opened up on the difficulty of maintaining this winning run with so many matches in such a short period.\n\nHe elaborated, “it’s not easy to come off the pitch that we played on mid-week [against Atletico Madrid], get back at 4am and produce a winning performance today.”\n\nSkinner explained, “London City made it very difficult for us, but I just believe this team will always find a way.”\n\nUnited played particularly poorly by their high standards and managed only two shots on target in the entire match.\n\nThey also faced another injury concern with Jayde Riviere, having already lost Anna Sandberg in Madrid.\n\nCommenting on the problems his side faced, he added, “the amount of challenges we had in the game… I put [midfielder] Lisa Naalsund in about seven different positions.”\n\nHe also argued that his side were missing their usual energy and cohesion. Not for the first time this year, he praised his squad depth, claiming the players he brought on “were incredible”.\n\nSkinner concluded, “we just needed to get through today – we really did. The most successful teams in the country have done it for many years. Chelsea have definitely done that. We can mix our style and what you saw today was just a special spirit in the group. They never give up.”\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Liverpool are finally looking to replace Luis Diaz. However, this one is a £100m risk.\n\nLiverpool controversially sold Luis Diaz without a replacement in the summer. The Reds did take in a lot of money for the Colombian - but didn’t spend it on a new winger.\n\nAnd that created a huge problem. Liverpool were near-reliant on Diaz to be the forward who consistently attacked defenders one-v-one and broke the lines that way.\n\nWithout him, Liverpool just don’t have that kind of player. Rio Ngumoha isn’t quite ready and no one else in the squad offers that kind of direct running.\n\nIt’s a problem Arne Slot has voiced this season. “You always miss good players,” Slot said of Díaz this week, per the Telegraph. “He was so important for us last season.\"\n\nWell, it appears Liverpool are taking action to find that replacement. It’s a risky one, though.\n\nCaught Offside reports that Liverpool are looking at Anthony Gordon in a deal that could reach around £95m. Now, whether Newcastle United are willing to deal with the Reds is another matter - but there's strong interest from Anfield.\n\nIn fact, the report claims Liverpool lead the race here. They appear certain he’s the one for them, going back in for Gordon two years after they initially looked to sign him.\n\nIt would make Gordon the replacement on the left for Diaz. A direct winger who likes to consistently run forward with the ball, attack defenders and get the ball in the box.",

    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names behind the artificial intelligence boom are looking to stack Congress with allies who support lighter regulation of the emerging technology by drawing on the crypto industry’s 2024 election success.\n\nMarc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman are among tech leaders who’ve poured $50 million into a new super political action committee to help AI-friendly candidates prevail in November’s congressional races. Known as Leading the Future, the super PAC has taken center stage as voters grow increasingly concerned that AI risks driving up energy costs and taking away jobs.\n\nAs it launches operations, Leading the Future is deploying a strategy that worked two years ago for crypto advocates: talk about what’s likely to resonate with voters, not the industry or its interests and controversies. For AI, that means its ads won’t tout the technology but instead discuss core issues including economic opportunity and immigration — even if that means not mentioning AI at all.\n\n“They’re trying to be helpful in a campaign rather than talking about their own issue all the time,” said Craig Murphy, a Republican political consultant in Texas, where Leading the Future has backed Chris Gober, an ally of President Trump, in the state’s hotly contested 10th congressional district.\n\nThis year, the group plans to spend up to $125 million on candidates who favor a single, national approach to AI regulation, regardless of party affiliation. The election comes at a crucial moment for the industry as it invests hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure that will put fresh strains on resources, with new data centers already blamed for driving up utility bills.\n\nLeading the Future faces a growing challenge from AI safety advocates, who’ve started their own super PAC called Public First with a goal of raising $50 million for candidates who favor stricter oversight. On Thursday, Public First landed a $20-million pledge from Anthropic PBC, a rival to OpenAI that has set itself apart from other AI companies by supporting tougher rules.\n\nPolls show deepening public concern over AI’s impact on everything from jobs to education to the environment. Sixty-two percent of US adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week, and 58% are concerned the government will not go far enough in regulating it, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nJesse Hunt, a Leading the Future spokesman, said the group is “committed to supporting policymakers who want a smart national regulatory framework for AI,” one that boosts US employment while winning the race against China. Hunt said the super PAC backs ways to protect consumers “without ceding America’s technological future to extreme ideological gatekeepers.”\n\nThe political and economic stakes are enormous for OpenAI and others behind Leading the Future, including venture capitalists Andreessen and Horowitz. Their firm, a16z, is the richest in Silicon Valley with billions of dollars invested in AI upstarts including coding startup Cursor and AI leaderboard platform LM Arena.\n\nFor now, their super PAC is doing most of the talking for the AI industry in the midterm races. Meta Platforms Inc. has announced plans for AI-related political spending on state-level contests, with $20 million for its California-based super PAC and $45 million for its American Technology Excellence Project, according to Politico.\n\nOther companies with massive AI investment plans — Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — have their own corporate PACs to dole out bipartisan federal campaign donations. Nvidia Corp., the chip giant driving AI policy in Washington, doesn’t have its own PAC.\n\nTo ensure consistent messaging across party lines, Leading the Future has created two affiliated super PACs — one spending on Republicans and another on Democrats. The aim is to build a bipartisan coalition that can be effective in Washington regardless of which party is in power.\n\nTexas, home of OpenAI’s massive Stargate project, is one of the states where Leading the Future has already jumped in. Its Republican arm, American Mission, has spent nearly $750,000 on ads touting Gober, a political lawyer who’s previously worked for Elon Musk’s super PAC and is in a crowded GOP primary field for an open House seat.\n\nThe ads hail Gober as a “MAGA warrior” who “will fight for Texas families, lowering everyday costs.” Gober’s campaign website lists “ensuring America’s AI dominance” as one of his top campaign priorities. Gober’s campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn New York, Leading the Future’s Democratic arm, Think Big, has spent $1.1 million on television ads and messages attacking Alex Bores, a New York state assemblyman who has called for tougher AI safety protocols and is now running for an open congressional seat encompassing much of central Manhattan.\n\nThe ads seize on Democrats’ revulsion over Trump’s immigration crackdown and target Bores for his work at Palantir Technologies Inc., which contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Think Big has circulated mailings and text messages citing Bores’ work with Palantir, urging voters to “Reject Bores’ hypocrisy on ICE.”\n\nIn an interview, Bores called the claims in the ads false, explaining that he left Palantir because of its work with ICE. He pointed out the irony that Joe Lonsdale, a Palantir co-founder who’s backed the administration’s border crackdown, is a donor to Leading the Future.\n\n“They’re not being ideologically consistent,” Bores said. “The fact that they have been so transparent and said, ‘Hey, we’re the AI industry and Alex Bores will regulate AI and that scares us,’ has been nothing but a benefit so far.”\n\nLeading the Future’s Democratic arm also plans to spend seven figures to support Democrats in two Illinois congressional races: former Illinois Representatives Jesse Jackson Jr. and Melissa Bean.\n\nLeading the Future is following the path carved by Fairshake, a pro-cryptocurrency super PAC that joined affiliates in putting $133 million into congressional races in 2024. Fairshake made an early mark by spending $10 million to attack progressive Katie Porter in the California Democratic Senate primary, helping knock her out of the race in favor of Adam Schiff, the eventual winner who’s seen as more friendly to digital currency.\n\nThe group also backed successful primary challengers against House incumbents, including Democrats Cori Bush in Missouri and Jamaal Bowman in New York. Both were rated among the harshest critics of digital assets by the Stand With Crypto Alliance, an industry group.\n\nIn its highest-profile 2024 win, Fairshake spent $40 million to help Republican Bernie Moreno defeat incumbent Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, a crypto skeptic who led the Senate Banking Committee. Overall, it backed winners in 52 of the 61 races where it spent at least $100,000, including victories in three Senate and nine House battlegrounds.\n\nFairshake and Leading the Future share more than a strategy. Josh Vlasto, one of Leading the Future’s political strategists, does communications work for Fairshake. Andreessen and Horowitz are also among Fairshake’s biggest donors, combining to give $23.8 million last year.\n\nBut Leading the Future occasionally conflicts with Fairshake’s past spending. The AI group said Wednesday it plans to spend half a million dollars on an ad campaign for Laurie Buckhout, a former Pentagon official who’s seeking a congressional seat in North Carolina with calls to slash rules “strangling American innovation.” In 2024, during Buckhout’s unsuccessful run for the post, Fairshake spent $2.3 million supporting her opponent and eventual winner, Democratic Rep. Donald Davis.\n\n“The fact that they tried to replay the crypto battle means that we have to engage,” said Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Texas who helped launch Public First. “I’d say Leading the Future was the forcing function.”\n\nUnlike crypto, proponents of stricter AI regulations have backers within the industry. Even before its contribution to Public First, Anthropic had pressed for “responsible AI” with sturdier regulations for the fast-moving technology and opposed efforts to preempt state laws.\n\nAnthropic employees have also contributed to candidates targeted by Leading the Future, including a total of $168,500 for Bores, Federal Election Commission records show. A super PAC Dream NYC, whose only donor in 2025 was an Anthropic machine learning researcher who gave $50,000, is backing Bores as well.\n\nCarson, who’s co-leading the super PAC with former Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah, cites public polling that more than 80% of US adults believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, and says voter sentiment is on Public First’s side.\n\nPublic First didn’t disclose receiving any donations last year, according to FEC filings. But one of the group’s affiliated super PACs, Defend our Values PAC, reported receiving $50,000 from Public First Action Inc., the group’s advocacy arm. The PAC hasn’t yet spent any of that money on candidates.\n\nCrypto’s clout looms large in lawmakers’ memory, casting a shadow over any effort to regulate the big tech companies, said Doug Calidas, head of government affairs for AI safety group Americans for Responsible Innovation.\n\n“Fairshake was just so effective,” said Calidas, whose group has called for tougher AI regulations. “Democrats and Republicans are scared they’re going to replicate that model.”\n\nAllison and Birnbaum write for Bloomberg.",

NBC and Peacock have full coverage of the Winter Olympics in the United States.\n\nBut overseas, BBC has main Winter Olympics coverage. However, one of the network's announcers has faced scrutiny in the past for violating the official broadcasting outfit rules.\n\nChemmy Alcott, 43, competed in four Winter Olympics and seven World Championships for Great Britain.\n\nAlcott retired from professional skiing in 2014 and later joined the broadcasting world. She first became a commentator for Eurosport before joining the BBC for its 2018 Winter Games coverage.\n\nHowever, Alcott received an official public reprimand from BBC for violating Winter Olympics broadcasting rules.\n\n\"In 2022, she was spotted wearing knitwear from the brand whilst presenting Ski Sunday and providing coverage of the Winter Olympics. This led to a stern reprimand from BBC executives, who gave her a \"reminder of the BBC's guidelines in relation to commercial conflicts of interest,'\" the Daily Express reported.\n\n\"BBC guidelines prohibit presenters from \"appearing on air wearing clothes or using products, goods or services which they have agreed, or been contracted, to promote or in which they have financial interest.\" However, she found herself in trouble again a year later after donning Snow Finel items during the first two episodes of a new Ski Sunday series.\"\n\nAlcott was officially reprimanded.\n\n\"Chemmy will not be wearing the brand in question on air again and has been spoken to about this,\" BBC announced.\n\nThe Winter Olympics announcer has not been found to be in any outfit violations so far at these Winter Games.",

    "description": "Farmers depend on healthy crops for their livelihoods.",
    "fullText": "Florida's orange harvest is expected to be the smallest since 1930 because of major declines in healthy trees, affecting both farmers and consumers across the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to Insurance Journal, which cited data from the Department of Agriculture, the state will have an estimated output of 12 million boxes of oranges this season — a 2% decline compared to last season.\n\nSince around 2000, Florida's orange groves have been shrinking because of a devastating, incurable bacterial infection called citrus greening disease, which kills tree roots and stunts growth. The disease causes fruits to be smaller, greener, and bitter, making them essentially unsellable.\n\nRapid urban development has also led to the removal of many orange groves, and damage from intense hurricanes — for example, Ian, Nicole, and Milton — since 2022 has further destroyed trees.\n\nInsurance Journal reported that treatments have helped some trees recover, but that hasn't been enough to restore yields to their former levels.\n\n\"It'll be a process to see the overall fruit count increase,\" Matt Joyner, CEO of Florida Citrus Mutual, told the news outlet. \"That's going to take a number of years to get that broader number up.\"\n\nFarmers depend on healthy crops for their livelihoods, but the financial strain from poor harvests has forced many out of business, according to WUSF. Remaining farmers are frustrated by the lack of breakthroughs in research to combat the disease as well as by other losses due to worsening storms and erratic weather.\n\nFood and Wine reported that hurricanes have been especially brutal in the Sunshine State since 2020, reflecting the impact of rising global temperatures on orange yields.\n\n\"It can take up to three to five years for a damaged tree to recover from an extreme weather event (if it survives at all) and return to peak production,\" Marisa Zansler, the Florida Department of Citrus' director of economic and market research, told the magazine.\n\nSmaller harvests usually mean more expensive grocery prices, though Insurance Journal reported that orange juice futures have dropped significantly as Brazil, the world's top orange exporter, expects a major boost in production.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nRecent cold snaps and hurricanes have also resulted in millions of dollars in losses for vegetable, potato, melon, and strawberry farmers throughout Florida.\n\nAccording to WUSF, Florida lawmakers are working to pass a bill that would reduce the minimum sugar content required for orange juice, the end product for much of the state's harvests. Fresh oranges in grocery stores are more likely to come from California, and the USDA predicts a high output from the state this year, which should stabilize prices.\n\nScientists have also been experimenting with genetically modified orange trees that can withstand or resist citrus greening. They say it could be the breakthrough the industry needs to stay afloat amid rising production costs and increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather.\n\nKeeping tabs on how the climate impacts orange harvests will help you know what to expect at the grocery store and shop smarter.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian drone strike ignited fires at one of Russia’s Black Sea ports, officials said Sunday, ahead of fresh talks aimed at ending the nearly 4-year-old war.\n\nTwo people were wounded in the attack on the port of Taman in the Krasnodar region, which damaged an oil storage tank, warehouse and terminals, according to regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev.\n\nMeanwhile, falling debris from Russian drones damaged civilian and transport infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa region, officials said, causing disruption to the power and water supply.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nThe attacks came ahead of another round of U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva, just before the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested there were still questions remaining over future security guarantees for his country. Zelenskyy also questioned how the concept of a free trade zone — proposed by the U.S. — would work in the Donbas region, which Russia insists Kyiv must give up for peace.\n\nHe said the Americans want peace as quickly as possible and that the U.S. team wants to sign all the agreements on Ukraine at the same time, whereas Ukraine wants guarantees for the country’s future security signed first.\n\nZelenskyy’s concerns were echoed by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a ranking member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n“Unless we have real security guarantees on whatever peace agreement is ultimately determined, we are going to be here again, because one of the things we know is that Russia has geared up not just for Ukraine, but to go beyond Ukraine,” she told reporters in Munich on Sunday.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia was hoping to win diplomatically what it had failed to achieve on the battlefield, and was banking on the U.S. to deliver concessions at the negotiating table. But Kallas told the Munich conference Sunday that key Russian demands — including the lifting of sanctions and unfreezing of assets — were decisions for Europe.\n\n“If we want a sustainable peace then we need concessions also from the Russian side,” she said.\n\nPrevious U.S.-led efforts to find consensus on ending the war, most recently two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have failed to resolve difficult issues, such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland that is largely occupied by Russian forces.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Officials in Minnesota made a worrying discovery in a lake outside St. Paul, Minnesota, of zebra mussel larvae, one of the most pervasive threats to the waters of the Great Lakes region.\n\nOfficials with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) confirmed there are zebra mussel larvae in Tanners Lake in Landfall, Minn., according to a report from Pioneer Press. Samples showed 12 zebra mussel larvae, called veligers, present in the water.\n\n\"While the DNR has not found adult zebra mussels in Tanners Lake, the presence of veligers suggests reproducing zebra mussel populations,\" officials said in a statement. Due to their presence, Tanners Lake is now listed as \"infested with zebra mussels,\" per the department.\n\nMinnesota state law requires boaters, anglers, and those who own waterfront property to follow strict guidelines to prevent the spread of zebra mussels, regardless of whether a lake has an infestation.\n\nZebra mussels are an invasive species that can spread quickly. The MDNR notes that females can produce 100,000 to 500,000 eggs per year. After their veligers (fertilized eggs) form shells, they can attach themselves to surfaces, forming dense beds that can reach tens of thousands in a single square yard. They were first recorded in the Great Lakes region in 1988, believed to have been introduced through contaminated cargo ship ballast water.\n\nThe zebra mussels have caused major disruptions to the ecosystem, outcompeting native mussels and other species for resources and interfering with natural aquatic plant growth. For people, they can clog water intakes for power plants, encrust boats and other equipment, and cut swimmers' and pets' feet when they're attached to docks and rafts.\n\nMinnesota isn't the only state dealing with the headaches caused by the invasive species. Officials in Iowa recently discovered zebra mussels in the Des Moines River, part of their spread westward over the past few decades.\n\nThe MDNR encourages people to report the presence of zebra mussels in any body of water, regardless of whether there's a known infestation or not. They should also follow the department's guidelines on cleaning boats, properly disposing of bait, and drying vessels for 21 days before moving from one body of water to another.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday it completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, the latest effort by leader Kim Jong Un to honor the war dead.\n\nState media photos showed Kim Jong Un walking through the new street — called Saeppyol Street — and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, as he pledged to repay the “young martyrs” who “sacrificed all to their motherland.”\n\nIn recent months, North Korea has intensified propaganda glorifying troops deployed to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine, such as establishing a memorial wall and building a museum. Analysts see it as an effort to bolster internal unity and curb potential public discontent.\n\nKim in recent months has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, to fuel Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, as the leaders align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.\n\nSouth Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers last week it estimated 6,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded during their deployment in the war, but did not provide a breakdown of fatalities. The agency said last year it believed roughly 600 had died.\n\nThe spy agency believes North Korean forces are gaining modern combat experience and Russian technical support that could improve the performance of their weapons systems, according to lawmakers who attended last week’s closed-door briefing.\n\nThe construction of the new street comes as North Korea prepares to open a major ruling party congress later this month, where Kim is expected to announce his major goals in domestic and foreign policy over the next five years and take further steps to tighten his control.",

    "title": "Trump team offers its answer to rising premium costs: catastrophic coverage",
    "description": "The changes come as affordability is a key concern for many Americans, some of whom are struggling to pay their ACA premiums.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration has unveiled a sweeping set of regulatory proposals that would substantially change health plan offerings on the Affordable Care Act marketplace next year, aiming, it says, to provide more choice and lower premiums. But it also proposes sharply raising some annual out-of-pocket costs — to more than $27,000 for one type of coverage — and could cause up to 2 million people to drop insurance.\n\nThe changes come as affordability is a key concern for many Americans, some of whom are struggling to pay their ACA premiums since enhanced subsidies expired at the end of last year. Initial enrollment numbers for this year fell by more than 1 million.\n\nHealth care coverage and affordability have become politically potent issues in the run-up to November’s midterm elections.\n\nThe proposed changes are part of a lengthy rule that addresses a broad swath of standards, including benefit packages, out-of-pocket costs, and health care provider networks. Insurers refer to these standards when setting premium rates for the coming year.\n\nAfter a comment period, the rule will be finalized this spring.\n\nIt “puts patients, taxpayers, and states first by lowering costs and reinforcing accountability for taxpayer dollars,” said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz in a Feb. 9 press release.\n\nOne way it would do so focuses heavily on a type of coverage — catastrophic plans — that last year attracted only about 20,000 policyholders, according to the proposal, although other estimates put it closer to 54,000.\n\n“To me, this proposal reads like the administration has found their next big thing in the catastrophic plans,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nSuch plans have very high annual out-of-pocket costs for the policyholder but often lower premiums than other ACA coverage options. Formerly restricted to those under age 30 or facing certain hardships, the Trump administration allowed older people who lost subsidy eligibility to enroll in them for this year. It is not yet known how many people chose to do so.\n\nThe payment rule cements this move by making eligible anyone whose income is below the poverty line ($15,650 for this year) and those earning more than 2.5 times that amount who lost access to an ACA subsidy that lowered their out-of-pocket costs. It also notes that a person meeting these standards would be eligible in any state — an important point because this coverage is currently available in only 36 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn addition, the proposal would require out-of-pocket maximums on such plans to hit $15,600 a year for an individual and $27,600 for a family, Keith wrote this week in Health Affairs. (The current out-of-pocket max for catastrophic plans is $10,600 for an individual plan and $21,200 for family coverage.) Not counting preventive care and three covered primary care doctor visits, that spending target must be met before a policy’s other coverage kicks in.\n\nIn the rule, the administration wrote that the proposed changes would help differentiate catastrophic from “bronze” plans, the next level up, and, possibly, spur more enrollment in the former. Currently, the proposal said, there may not be a significant difference if premiums are similar. Raising the out-of-pocket maximum for catastrophic plans to those levels would create that difference, the proposal said.\n\n“When there is such a clear difference, the healthier consumers that are generally eligible and best suited to enroll in catastrophic plans are more motivated to select a catastrophic plan in lieu of a bronze plan,” the proposal noted.\n\nHowever, ACA subsidies cannot be used toward catastrophic premiums, which could limit shoppers’ interest.\n\nEnrollment in bronze plans, which currently have an average annual deductible of $7,500, has doubled since 2018 to about 5.4 million last year. This year, that number will likely be higher. Some states’ sign-up data indicates a shift toward bronze as consumers left higher-premium “silver,” “gold,” or “platinum” plans following the expiration of more generous subsidies at the end of last year.\n\nThe proposal also would allow insurers to offer bronze plans with cost-sharing rates that exceed what the ACA law currently allows, but only if that insurer also sells other bronze plans with lower cost-sharing levels.\n\nIn what it calls a “novel” approach, the proposal would allow insurers to offer multiyear catastrophic plans, in which people could stay enrolled for up to 10 years, and their out-of-pocket maximums would vary over that time. Costs might be higher, for example, in the early years, then fall the longer the policy is in place. The proposal specifically asks for comments on how such a plan could be structured and what effect multiyear plans might have on the overall market.\n\n“As we understand it thus far, insurers could offer the policy for one year or for consecutive years, up to 10 years,” said Zach Sherman, managing director for coverage policy and program design at HMA, also known as Health Management Associates, a health policy consulting firm that does work for states and insurance plans. “But the details on how that would work, we are still unpacking.”\n\nMatthew Fiedler, senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, said the proposed rule included a lot of provisions that could “expose enrollees to much higher out-of-pocket costs.”\n\nIn addition to the planned changes to bronze and catastrophic plans, he points to another provision that would allow plans to be sold on the ACA exchange that have no set health care provider networks. In other words, the insurer has not contracted with specific doctors and hospitals to accept their coverage. Instead, such plans would pay medical providers a set amount toward medical services, possibly a flat fee or a percentage of what Medicare pays, for example. The rule says insurers would need to ensure “access to a range of providers” willing to accept such amounts as payment in full. Policyholders might be on the hook for unexpected expenses, however, if a clinician or facility doesn’t agree and charges the patient the difference.\n\nBecause the rule is so sweeping — with many other parts — it is expected to draw hundreds, if not thousands, of comments between now and early March.\n\nPennsylvania insurance broker Joshua Brooker said one change he would like to see is requiring insurers that sell the very high out-of-pocket catastrophic plans to offer other catastrophic plans with lower annual maximums.\n\nOverall, though, a wider range of options might appeal to people on both ends of the income scale, he said.\n\nSome wealthier enrollees, especially those who no longer qualify for any ACA premium subsidies, would prefer a lower premium like those expected in catastrophic plans, and could just pay the bills up to that max, he said.\n\n“They’re more worried about the half-million-dollar heart attack,” Brooker said. It’s tougher for people below the poverty level, who don’t qualify for ACA subsidies and, in 10 states, often don’t qualify for Medicaid. So they’re likely to go uninsured. At least a catastrophic plan, he said, might let them get some preventive care coverage and cap their exposure if they end up in a hospital. From there, they might qualify for charity care at the hospital to cover out-of-pocket costs.\n\nOverall, “putting more options on the market doesn’t hurt, as long as it is disclosed properly and the consumer understands it,” he said.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

    "fullText": "An Australian man says he was just deported from the United States because he joked about moving into Billie Eilish's mansion.\n\nDrew Pavlou is a 25-year-old political activist best known for protesting the Chinese government. He once got arrested outside the Chinese embassy in London. He ran for the Australian Senate. He describes himself as a \"misunderstood theorist of global justice.\" If you haven't heard of him, that's fine. Ten million people just did.\n\nAfter Eilish told the Grammy audience that \"no one is illegal on stolen land\" and added \"f--k ICE,\" Pavlou posted on X that he was moving into her Malibu beachfront mansion because \"no human being is illegal on stolen land.\" He launched a GoFundMe. GoFundMe deleted it at $3,000. He moved to GiveSendGo. He booked a flight.\n\nExciting news: I’ve decided to move into Billie Eilish’s $6 million Malibu beachfront mansion because no human being is illegal on stolen land.\n\nThank you Billie for your generosity. pic.twitter.com/1egsPPKs5i\n\n— Drew Pavlou 🇦🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦🇹🇼 (@DrewPavlou) February 2, 2026\n\nHe never made it past immigration. Pavlou says he was detained for over 30 hours. Customs asked if he planned to trespass on Eilish's property. He told them he was shitposting. They asked if he'd ever threatened to blow up Chinese government installations.\n\nHe claims Eilish's legal team tipped off DHS — though no confirmation has surfaced. What is confirmed: he got food poisoning from a microwave burrito, read hundreds of pages of Roberto Bolaño in a holding facility, and was sent back to Australia. His post about it has 10 million views. Elon Musk replied: \"Most ironic outcome is most likely.\"\n\nBillie Eilish got me deported from the US - I think her legal team contacted DHS\n\nI spent 30 hours at LAX immigration trying to explain that my shit posts were just a joke and that I didn’t actually plan to personally move into her mansion\n\nHonestly… https://t.co/R4ynQEor3c pic.twitter.com/8eVCcBE5Jr\n\n— Drew Pavlou 🇦🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦🇹🇼 (@DrewPavlou) February 15, 2026\n\nHere's the thing — Pavlou isn't the first person to test what Eilish said. He's just the one who got on a plane. The list started growing the morning after the speech.\n\nWithin hours, people pointed out that her $2.3 million Glendale mansion sits on the ancestral land of the Tongva tribe — the Indigenous people of the greater Los Angeles Basin. They're not a historical footnote. They're an active tribe seeking federal recognition. A Tongva spokesperson confirmed to Newsweek that Eilish's home is \"situated in our ancestral land,\" and that she has never contacted them. Not before the speech. Not after. Not even a DM.\n\nThey added a request that's easy to miss and hard to forget — that people actually name the Tongva when talking about \"stolen land,\" instead of using the phrase as a blank slogan without specifying whose land it was.\n\nTwo days later, LA-based Sinai Law Firm offered on X to evict Eilish pro bono on behalf of the Tongva. Attorney Avi Sinai later told the New York Post the offer was satirical. But his follow-up had teeth: \"It's both empty virtue signaling and used as a weapon at the same time,\" he wrote. \"No elected official is giving the land back to the Tongva. Just like Billie Eilish is not going to get evicted nor will she give her house back.\"\n\nThen a GB News reporter drove to her Glendale mansion and stood at the gate. \"Billie, let us in, please. We are here because this is stolen land.\" The gate stayed closed. The property she called stolen was secured behind the kind of gate that suggests the person inside very much believes in property lines.\n\nSenators, cabinet secretaries, billionaires, Shark Tank hosts, the Hulk — all talking about Billie Eilish. The only person not talking about Billie Eilish was Billie Eilish.\n\nHer brother Finneas stepped in on Threads: \"Seeing a lot of very powerful old white men outraged about what my 24-year-old sister said during her acceptance speech. We can literally see your names in the Epstein files.\"\n\nThat was the closest thing to a response the Eilish camp has offered. Billie herself said nothing.\n\nHere's what Billie Eilish has said publicly since February 1: \"No one is illegal on stolen land. F--k ICE.\"\n\nThat's it — at least on this subject.\n\nSince then, the Tongva tribe confirmed she lives on their land. A law firm offered to evict her using her own words. A reporter showed up at her gate. A senator, a Shark Tank host, the DHS secretary, and the president all weighed in. And an Australian shitposter says he was deported — possibly with the help of the same immigration system she told the Grammys to go f--k itself.\n\nEilish has not clarified whether \"no one is illegal on stolen land\" applies to Tongva tribal members, Australian shitposters, or British reporters standing at her gate.\n\nThe gate, for the record, is still closed.",

    "fullText": "LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — She says she was let down at every step. By a partner who abandoned her when she was pregnant. By a health service that denied her a legal abortion. And by a justice system that sent her to a maximum-security prison for illegally terminating her pregnancy on her own.\n\nViolet Zulu, a house cleaner in Zambia earning $40 a month, was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2024 after representing herself in court with little understanding of the consequences of her actions. She didn't see her two children or other family members for nearly two years.\n\nAfter word of her case reached international rights groups that helped her file an appeal, Zulu was freed last month. Activists say she represents many women in Africa who take desperate decisions when facing barriers to legal abortion services.\n\nHer story has drawn little sympathy in her southern African nation, where parts of society view abortion harshly. Her own mother said she agreed with her daughter's prison sentence, but said it should have been shorter.\n\nZulu spoke with The Associated Press as she pieces her life together again at the age of 26.\n\nShe said she first attempted to access legal abortion services at a public clinic, which should have given her advice or services but turned her away. She then tried a private pharmacy, which requested 800 Zambian kwacha ($43) for abortion drugs, a month's salary for her.\n\nShe was already struggling to feed her two young sons, and she sometimes had to beg food from relatives.\n\nShe said her decision to drink an herbal concoction she prepared herself, one known for terminating pregnancies, was taken out of despair. She couldn't bear for her boys to have even less food if she had another child.\n\n“I never wanted to abort my pregnancy, but it is the circumstances at home that forced me to do it,\" Zulu said in the interview at the two-room rented home with no running water that she shares with her children and parents.\n\n“I was scared (when I took the concoction), but I didn’t really care what would happen to me,\" she added.\n\nIn her court testimony, she explained what happened next: She delivered the fetus in a toilet, placed it in a sack and dropped it in a nearby stream. She said she confided in a friend, but word got out and neighbors reported her to police.\n\nZulu, who left school in the eighth grade, was never offered free legal counsel despite the right to request it. She represented herself in court and pleaded guilty to the offense of procuring her own abortion. She said she didn’t understand the legality of abortion and thought she would receive a warning.\n\n“This is a system that failed Violet,” said Rosemary Kirui, a legal adviser for Africa for the abortion rights group Center for Reproductive Rights, which campaigned for Zulu’s release and helped with her appeal. “It is not that she did not try. It is that she could not afford the services, yet she should be able to access them as a citizen of Zambia.”\n\nZulu should have been eligible for a free abortion under a provision that allows doctors in Zambia to consider risks to the well-being of her existing children, said Sharon Williams, country director for the Women and Law in Southern Africa advocacy group.\n\nBut Zulu was not aware of that, largely because of the secrecy, stigma and shame around abortion, which is not advertised by Zambia's public health system.\n\nZambia's health ministry did not respond to questions about her case.\n\nPart of the problem, Williams said, is that Zambia has legalized abortion while also defining itself in its constitution as a strongly Christian country.\n\nAbortions are still largely restricted in Africa, with few countries allowing them for reasons other than threats to the health of the mother or the fetus. Even in countries like Zambia, religious beliefs, conservative values rooted in local cultures or a lack of information make access to legal procedures difficult, according to health and rights groups.\n\nWilliams said Zulu’s case ought to lead to a national conversation over whether Zambian authorities should better educate communities over the legal right to abortion.\n\n“I think now that we have this judgment, we’re ready for the conversation,\" she said.\n\nActivists say desperate women turn to unsafe abortions. Africa and Latin America have the highest proportions of them, with approximately 75% of all abortions in Africa deemed unsafe, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute health rights organization estimated in a 2019 report that over 6 million unsafe abortions a year occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. It noted that Zambia's abortion law “tended to be a ‘paper law’ rather than one that ensures widespread access.”\n\nIn South Africa, which claims to have the most progressive laws on the continent, abortion has been legal for nearly 30 years. It is allowed on request before 13 weeks of pregnancy and for several reasons before 21 weeks.\n\nBut studies estimate only 7% of public health facilities there offer abortion services.\n\nIn 2023, the case of a 14-year-old who was denied an abortion by South African health workers three times for reasons that were not valid prompted a national reality check. After an urgent court case, a judge ordered that the girl be allowed to have an abortion, which was performed on the last day eligible by law.\n\nAt the time, a representative of the social justice group that represented the girl said South Africa's abortion laws were being undermined by \"the abuse of medical knowledge by health care professionals\" in trying to prevent abortions.\n\nIn Zambia, Zulu said she still felt bad about what she did but must now provide for her sons. She was looking for work again, she said.\n\nImray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "description": "The \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" showrunner said he included a brief scene in episode 5 to hint at Dunk's relation to Brienne in \"Game of Thrones.\"",
    "fullText": "Spoilers ahead for \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season one, episode five, \"In the Name of the Mother,\" and the book \"The World of Ice & Fire.\"\n\nHBO's newest \"Game of Thrones\" prequel, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" centers on Dunk, a lovable hero distinguished by his tall frame, raw strength, and unshakeable moral code.\n\nFor fans of the original series, that description may sound awfully familiar — and that's no accident.\n\nA blink-and-you-miss-it detail from episode five, \"In the Name of the Mother,\" draws a subtle throughline between Dunk and another prominent knight from Westerosi history: Brienne of Tarth, who appears a century later in the \"Game of Thrones\" timeline.\n\nIn a flashback scene, a young Dunk is shown walking down the kingsroad with his childhood friend, Rafe, returning to their home in King's Landing. This route runs for thousands of miles across Westeros, easing travel to and from the capital.\n\nIn \"Game of Thrones,\" Jaime Lannister sends Brienne in the opposite direction, away from King's Landing, on a quest to find and protect Sansa Stark. He also assigns Podrick Payne to serve as her squire. In season five, episode five, \"First of His Name,\" the duo travels down the same wooded path that Dunk and Rafe had trodden before.\n\n\"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" showrunner Ira Parker confirmed to Business Insider that he intentionally included this parallel. Both scenes were filmed in the same location in Ireland.\n\n\"It's the exact same road in Belfast, same trees and everything,\" Parker said. \"There's no attention drawn to it, but anyone who's a deep, deep fan of the show, hopefully, will pick up on that.\"\n\nParker said he liked the idea of distant relatives crossing paths generations apart.\n\nAuthor George R. R. Martin, who's also credited as an executive producer on \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" confirmed in 2016 at a sci-fi and fantasy convention that Brienne is Dunk's descendant.\n\nMartin's \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" trilogy doesn't cover this chapter in Dunk's life; in the last installment that was published, \"The Mystery Knight,\" he's only about 19 or 20 years old. But it sounds like, at some point during his travels, Dunk coupled up with a lady of House Tarth in the stormlands — and left a souvenir or two in his wake. In \"A Feast for Crows,\" the fourth book in Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series, Brienne recalls seeing a shield with Dunk's personal sigil in her father's armory.\n\nIn season one of \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" as in the novella it's based on, \"The Hedge Knight,\" the running joke is that no one knows who Dunk is.\n\nHe grew up as an orphan in Flea Bottom, the poorest area of King's Landing, before he became a squire for Ser Arlan of Pennytree, a sloppy hedge knight. The two would roam Westeros, taking work where they could find it and offering help when it was needed, but they rarely left an impression on the lords and ladies of the realm.\n\nAs a result, Dunk struggles to be taken seriously after Arlan's death. He has no status, no money, and no one to vouch for him. Hardly anyone even believes he's a real knight. He begins introducing himself with a slightly more impressive name: Ser Duncan the Tall.\n\nHowever, fans of Martin's source material know that Dunk's anonymity doesn't last for very long. Thanks to the fictional history book, \"The World of Ice & Fire,\" we know that his young squire, Egg, grows up to become King Aegon V Targaryen.\n\nAfter their many adventures together, King Aegon recruits Dunk to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard — the highest honor for a knight in Westeros. (This also means Dunk swore an oath not to marry or father children, which makes Brienne's lineage even more of a mystery.)\n\nDunk was so good at his job that he's still famous a century later. In season four of \"Game of Thrones,\" Dunk's name appears in the Book of Brothers, a written history of the Kingsguard.\n\n\"Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan,\" Joffrey Baratheon notes while flipping through the pages. \"He must have been quite a man.\"\n\nIndeed, Dunk's rise through the ranks closely resembles Brienne's.\n\nLike Dunk, Brienne is motivated by honor and loyalty, and she's known for her tremendous height and strength. Although she's not low-born, Brienne still struggles to earn respect as a warrior. Fighting is considered unnatural for a lady, and technically, women aren't allowed to be knighted in Westeros, so Brienne is often met with ridicule and violence.\n\nStill, she manages to overcome this unjust class system by making friends with the right people. Defying convention, Brienne is knighted by Jaime in season eight of \"Game of Thrones,\" in an episode titled \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\" She finishes the series as the very first Lady Commander of the Kingsguard.\n\nIn her final scene, Brienne writes in the very same book that features four pages about her ancestor. Odds are, by the end of her service to King Bran, she'll end up with just as many or more.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Elordi, 28, is everywhere right now — he's just not on social media.\n\nFrom \"Euphoria\" to \"Saltburn\" and \"Priscilla,\" to Guillermo del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" last year and \"Wuthering Heights,\" released last week, Elordi has cemented his place as one of Hollywood's most in-demand young actors.\n\nBut in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, he made it clear that he has no interest in putting his private life online.\n\n\"I have no relationship with social media,\" Elordi told CBS correspondent Tracy Smith.\n\n\"My dream was to be an actor. My dream was to play in the movies and, you know, I'm far too nervous to ask for more than that. I've been given exactly what I wanted, and I see it exactly how I dreamed it, and I live it how I dreamed it. So for me, that's about all I can handle,\" Elordi said.\n\nThough the Australian actor has had an Instagram account in the past, he's known to deactivate it often. His account has been deactivated since late 2024.\n\nFor Elordi, staying offline is a way to keep Hollywood from taking over his entire identity. Despite his rising profile — he's TK he says that the boundary allows him to move through his private life mostly unbothered.\n\n\"I have a pretty strong refusal to lose my life to an industry, you know. I consider myself an actor and just an actor. And so for me, life kind of goes on outside the set, and outside of these lights and cameras and things,\" he said. \"I don't have too much trouble in the world.\"\n\nEven with cameras around, Elordi says being a Hollywood star barely registers in his daily life.\n\n\"It doesn't really factor into my reality, you know,\" Elordi said. \"I have so much love in my life, and the relationships I have in my life are so present and real. I was raised in such a sort of authentic and true way.\"\n\n\"I feel so deeply here that, I don't know, the idea of this industry and stuff — it doesn't really factor into my day-to-day,\" he said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Elordi has spoken about social media and fame. In 2022, he said he woke up to 4 million new Instagram followers after his breakout role in Netflix's \"The Kissing Booth,\" and the sudden public attention made him consider quitting acting.\n\n\"I hated being a character to the public. I felt so far from myself,\" Elordi told GQ.\n\nElordi isn't the only Gen Z actor to have spoken about staying offline.\n\nIn 2025, Mia Threapleton said her mother, Kate Winslet, encouraged her to make a list of pros and cons for joining Instagram when she was 14.\n\n\"The cons completely outweighed the pros for me. That was quite a clarifying moment. Since then, the more time I spend in this world, the more I'm really happy that I don't have it,\" Threapleton said.\n\nIt's not just a Hollywood thing, either. Plenty of Gen Zers are deciding they're better off offline.\n\nThey're trading smartphones for dumb phones, turning cellphones into makeshift landlines, and throwing anti-social media parties where no one's allowed to scroll.",

    "title": "Gold's rally isn't a sign of a commodity supercycle, Goldman Sachs says",
    "description": "Rising prices spur more supply in metals like copper, unlike gold's constrained output, limiting the odds of a lasting commodities supercycle.",
    "fullText": "Gold's powerful rally isn't a sign that a broader commodity boom is taking hold, Goldman Sachs says.\n\nThe yellow metal has been on a record run, surging past $5,500 per troy ounce late last month before pulling back. Spot gold was trading around $4,993 per troy ounce at 10:53 p.m. ET on Sunday, up about 17% this year.\n\n\"We're not expecting a super cycle where prices will just go higher forever,\" said Lina Thomas, a senior commodities analyst at Goldman Sachs, on the firm's \"The Markets\" podcast published on Friday.\n\nThat's even as the bank maintains a positive outlook on bullion. \"We're still bullish gold,\" Thomas said, adding that the bank is \"expecting gold to go to $5,400 by the end of 2026.\"\n\nGold's surge reflects a mix of structural buying and tactical flows.\n\nCentral banks have been accumulating gold as a hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. At the same time, Federal Reserve rate cuts have lowered the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets, such as gold.\n\nThomas also pointed to the \"debasement trade\" — investor concerns about government finances in Western economies — as a key force behind demand.\n\nThat theme has spilled into the options market. Investors have increasingly bought gold call options, which give them the right to buy gold ETFs at a set price in the future. As those bets build, banks and dealers who sold the contracts often purchase gold to manage their exposure, helping accelerate rallies.\n\nHowever, the same mechanism can amplify pullbacks.\n\nIn contrast to the strength in bullion, Goldman does not see the ingredients for a prolonged, broad-based commodities supercycle.\n\n\"Gold is something that you cannot bump. It's something that you cannot scale. It's something that the production is just very constrained,\" Thomas said.\n\nOther commodities don't share those limits. Higher prices in markets like copper typically encourage more output.\n\nThat supply response makes it harder for industrial commodities to sustain ever-rising prices, even if governments and investors are increasingly focused on securing materials.\n\nSilver, meanwhile, has been far more volatile. Thomas described the metal's recent swings as \"a story of a liquidity squeeze,\" centered in London, where global benchmark prices for precious metals are set.\n\nAbout half the silver in London vaults is already spoken for, and that available supply has shrunk as traders moved metal to the US ahead of potential tariffs.\n\nWith less silver to trade, just as investor demand picked up, prices have swung sharply, and Goldman doesn't expect that volatility to ease anytime soon.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $75.40 per ounce, off sharply from its all-time high above $121 per ounce in late January.",

It went public in Hong Kong last March, with its stock jumping 30% from its IPO price at market open.\n\nOther Asian beverage brands, like Luckin Coffee, have positioned themselves as Starbucks' rivals, offering similar drinks at lower prices.

    "fullText": "The biggest software companies might be reduced to mere data sources, says Snowflake's CEO.\n\n\"The big model makers want to create a world in which all of the data for all of the enterprises is easily available to them,\" Sridhar Ramaswamy said on an episode of Alex Kantrowitz's \"Big Technology Podcast\" published last week. \"Everything else, the world, is just a dumb data pipe that feeds into that big brain.\"\n\nPrior to becoming Snowflake's CEO in 2024, Ramaswamy was a partner at Greylock Ventures and cofounded AI search startup Neeva, which was acquired by Snowflake.\n\nRamaswamy added that Snowflake needs to operate with a \"fear\" that people would stop using AI agents developed by software companies and instead want an all-inclusive agent that has data from Snowflake, for example, and everywhere else\n\nHe said his solution was to let customers take the lead and decide how they want to access their data — directly through their own agents, or through a product like ChatGPT.\n\nIn the last few months, AI labs have evolved from being sources of AI infrastructure to becoming software providers themselves. OpenAI has entered the sales, support, and document analysis market, threatening incumbents such as Salesforce and Oracle.\n\nOn a podcast released last week, Andreessen Horowitz general partner Anish Acharya said software firms were being unnecessarily punished by Wall Street over fears that AI could take over their industry. The VC said that legacy software could not be replaced so easily, because it would not be worth it to use AI for every business function.\n\nHe said that software accounts for 8% to 12% of a company's expenses, so vibe coding to build the company's resource planning or payroll tools would only save about 10%. Instead, companies should focus on big-ticket items, like developing their core businesses or optimizing other costs.\n\nRamaswamy and Acharya's comments follow a brutal start of the month for software stocks, which dragged down tech and broader markets. The sell-off started when already-wary investors panicked about Anthropic's new AI tool, which can perform a range of clerical tasks for people working in the legal industry.",

    "fullText": "Another heavy defeat for Wales. Yet another record loss at the Principality Stadium.\n\nIt is hard to judge Welsh rugby results these days after Steve Tandy's side suffered a 54-12 thrashing by France in Cardiff. It is just the same old story as they now turn their attention to the visit of Scotland next Saturday.\n\nWales suffered more misery as Les Bleus romped to an eight-try victory with the hosts wilting again for a 13th straight Six Nations defeat.\n\nFrance transformed a Test match into an exhibition of carefree rugby as the visitors claimed their biggest Six Nations triumph in the Welsh capital.\n\nHome hammerings have become the norm with Wales having conceded 50 points on more than five occasions in under a year at the Principality Stadium.\n\nArgentina, South Africa, England and France have all achieved record wins in Cardiff in the past 11 months, while Wales have now suffered 10 successive Six Nations home losses in a sequence that stretches back four years.\n\nLowest Cardiff Six Nations crowd amid rugby turmoil\n\nCan anyone stop 'massive favourites' France in Six Nations?\n\nWelsh rugby is in continued disarray and has suffered a new lowest ever Six Nations crowd for Cardiff, as supporters begin to vote with their feet.\n\nFrench fans took over the Principality Stadium and Welsh rugby bosses should be grateful they attended in such numbers.\n\nGiven all of this, you might have expected to see a dejected Welsh response after the game. Witnessing the players in another losing huddle after even more heartbreak is tough to watch.\n\nWales coach Tandy tried to remain positive, viewing it as an improvement on the opening 48-7 defeat by England - correct, although coming from a very low bar.\n\nThere should not be much cause for optimism but Wales are desperately trying to find it as they cite a better set-piece and discipline.\n\n\"We are disappointed with the scoreline but there was \n\n\"I know you're all looking at me like I'm stupid, with the path we're on, but there were glimpses with the set-piece and intent of how we wanted to go after the game.\n\n\"There was enough where we can go back on Tuesday and work on things.\n\n\"It's not the scoreline we want but it's part of the journey we're on. Every nation is at different stages.\n\n\"We've got to focus on the things we did better, like discipline, and recognise there's areas we need to grow.\"\n\nThis was the fifth time in six games under Tandy that Wales have shipped more than 40 points.\n\nThere have been 302 points and 42 tries conceded during Tandy's tenure, an average of 50 points and seven tries per game.\n\nWales have now lost 23 out of the previous 25 Test matches since the 2023 World Cup.\n\nSo Tandy was asked how he could justify any positivity to fans who had witnessed Wales suffer another heavy defeat.\n\n\"I'm a coach, I understand as well,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Most people see the outcome and people will comment on things without always seeing the data.\n\n\"I've got an understanding of where we are. We've got young players and combinations coming in, we have to go through and experience it.\"\n\nTandy insists his view is an optimistic one.\n\n\"I knew the challenge that it was, coming into Wales,\" he added.\n\n\"It excites me about where we can go. Hopefully we can look back in 18 months time or whenever it is, and this was a part of it.\n\n\"We can't click our fingers and be one of the best in the world. It's a process.\"\n\nTandy also pointed to Wales having played the top four ranked sides in the world in the past four matches, with those losses against New Zealand, South Africa, England and France.\n\n\"There's also the context of the six games we've played,\" said Tandy, whose solitary win came against Japan with the last kick of the game.\n\n\"If you look at the teams we're playing, not that it's an excuse for the numbers of points we're conceding, we're playing ruthless sides.\n\n\"So there has to be an understanding of who we're playing. We know where we want to be as a team, but also know where we are.\n\n\"We're 11th in the world and have won two in 20-plus games.\"\n\nThe former Ospreys coach insists patience is required, stressing improvements \"won't come overnight\".\n\n\"For me as a coach, it's seeing where we are growing,\" outlined Tandy.\n\n\"You might not see the bits adding together but I believe it when I'm seeing the training week, with the mindset of the boys and how they keep coming back.\n\n\"We've got some young kids and it'll take time.\"\n\nTandy accepted it was demoralising to concede more than 50 points again at home.\n\n\"That's where we're at this time,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"We've conceded lots of yellow cards and points.\n\n\"It's not an effort-based thing. There's things we need to tidy up.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to address.\"\n\nThe former Scotland and Lions defence coach insisted there is a balance to getting everything right as a team.\n\n\"It's at the forefront of what we're trying to do but with the game at the minute, there are more points being scored than before.\n\n\"With the way it's being refereed, you get on the wrong side of them and it can rack up pretty easily.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to address. We're not going to win games by conceding 50 points.\n\n\"We're keen to address and build confidence in what we're trying to do.\"\n\nWales captain Dewi Lake agreed with Tandy's assessment that his side had delivered an improved performance against France.\n\n\"It's weird to say looking at the scoreline but we were much better than we were last week for large parts of that game,\" claimed Lake.\n\n\"France are a team near the top of the world and can create things out of absolutely nothing.\n\n\"They scored some world-class tries and have some world-class individuals.\n\n\"We know there's things to mop up but we won't hide away from that fact, or that we're disappointed with the scoreboard.\n\n\"But, all in all, we were much more positive.\"\n\nLake says the character of his squad cannot be questioned.\n\n\"The boys are never going to give up on a result or a Test match or a ball on the floor, anything like that,\" said Lake.\n\n\"As captain, I don't need to say anything. Those boys are ready to go anyway.\"\n\nWelsh fans will not doubt the players' heart.\n\nThey are, though, right to question the quality of the national squad and the WRU's stewardship of the game in Wales.\n\nRecord defeats are being normalised and the world rugby public are pitying this once proud nation.\n\nThat is where Welsh rugby currently stands. It is hard to be optimistic about that.",

After all, the Ags swept Elon to begin the 2025 season that ended in massive disappointment. But if you’re looking for reasons for optimism, the Aggies scored 13 more runs than opening weekend last year, and much more importantly committed no errors after committing five on opening weekend a year ago.\n\nIt’s also safe to say that a lineup that includes both Caden Sorrell and Gavin Grahovac, in addition to a slew of newcomers, has a chance to keep this team in a ton of games.\n\nThe Aggies host A&M-Corpus Christi for a midweek tilt at 6 p.m. on Tuesday before another weekend series at Blue Bell Park next weekend against Penn.

    "description": "Keselowski is now 0-17 in the Daytona 500, and he was critical of Herbst's driving in the final seconds of the race",
    "fullText": "Entering the 2026 Daytona 500, there were concerns around if the 42-year-old Brad Keselowski could even run the full race. He showed up to the track with a walking cane, following a December fall that left him with a broken femur.\n\nBut Keselowski quickly returned to form, and was a contender throughout Sunday's 68th running of the Daytona 500 — his 17th start in 'The Great American Race.'\n\nExiting Turn 4, he had a massive run. A push from 23XI teammate Riley Herbst helped Tyler Reddick making the winning pass, but Herbst was still eying 500 glory for himself. He went to the outside of Chase Elliott in the pass for second, but Keselowski was already there with a helpful push from Logano.\n\nAs the two drivers went for the same piece of race track, a massive crash ensued across the line with Keselowski finishing fifth, suffering heavy nose-damage. Keselowski was frustrated afterwards, and openly criticized, who at the same time was being praised by 23XI co-owner Michael Jordan for helping Reddick to win the 500.\n\n\"That was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen,\" said Keselowski. \"He had no chance of blocking my run. I had a huge run, I don't know if I could have gotten the 45 [Reddick], but I would have liked to have found out because my run was coming fast. The 35 [Herbst] just wrecked us in itself.\n\nKeselowski then added: \"I thought, well, you know, a one-lane block kind of makes sense, but to block from the very bottom all the way to the top and wreck yourself and everybody else is just stupid. Very, very stupid.\"\n\nThe positive for Keselowski, beyond still scoring a top five finish, is that his leg felt fine. It didn't bother him during the race, and he exited the car under his own power. \"Felt really good in the car, felt really good getting through the crash, and I'm happy for that.\"\n\nHowever, video shows that Herbst was holding the middle lane before trying to come up into Keselowski's lane to pass Elliott, but the late block still resulted in a massive crash. In the end, it was another possible Daytona 500 victory slipping through his fingertips, and a winless streak that now sits at 60 races.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Kansas State has reportedly parted ways with men's basketball coach Jerome Tang after it fell to 1-11 in Big 12 play on Saturday afternoon",
    "fullText": "MANHATTAN — The Jerome Tang era at Kansas State is over.\n\nThe basketball coach has been fired after four seasons of leading the Wildcats, according to a national report by On3's Pete Nakos and Joe Tipton. The university has yet to comment.\n\nKansas Stateis coming off a 78-64 loss to No. 3 Houston on Saturday, Feb. 14. The Wildcats are scheduled to host Baylor on Tuesday, Feb. 17, at 8 p.m.\n\nThe Wildcats are 10-15 overall with a 1-11 record in Big 12 play. They have six games remaining before the Big 12 Tournament in Kansas City.\n\nTang's buyout sits at $18.675 million. It was the nation's 12th-largest buyout figure entering the 2025-26 season, according to the USA TODAY Coaches Salary Database. It's believed to be the largest publicly known buyout in college basketball history.\n\nThe Tang era at Kansas State began with so much promise after he led the Wildcats to an Elite Eight appearance in his first season, 2022-23, only to take many steps back in the following three seasons.\n\nTang finished his K-State career with a 71-57 overall record. He made $3.6 million as Kansas State's coach in 2025-26. He was the 29th-highest paid coach in the country a season ago.\n\nTang has an offset clause in his contract, meaning the coach will be required to make a reasonable effort to obtain subsequent employment as long as Kansas State is obligated to pay his buyout over the next 24 months. K-State will be relieved on a dollar-for-dollar basis, provided the coach receives pay from sources directly related to being a college or professional coach, analyst, or administrator, as long as the pay is at an actual market rate.\n\nThe buyout is the largest in Kansas State athletics history. Tang replaced Bruce Weber, whom Kansas State paid a $1 million buyout after the coach resigned following the 2021-22 season. The Wildcats haven't had to fire a football coach since Ron Prince in 2008, when the two sides resolved a contract dispute that resulted in a $1.65 million buyout. The school gave Bill Snyder a $3 million payout upon his retirement after the 2018 football season.\n\nDuring his Kansas State career, Tang made north of $12.7 million, and will now more than double that with his buyout.\n\nTang had five years remaining on his contract.\n\nThe Tang era started out better than anyone could have hoped for, but the Wildcats have taken steps back each season since.\n\nKansas State was in the Elite Eight after a 26-10 record, while Tang earned Naismith National Coach of the Year honors in 2022-23. That led to Tang receiving a contract extension.\n\nThe Wildcats took a step back in 2023-24, going 19-15 and missing the NCAA Tournament. After that season, Tang was tied to openings at Arkansas and others, which led K-State to give him a raise and more guaranteed money to keep him. That's why his buyout is so massive.\n\nThat didn't lead to better results in 2024-25. A drama-filled year saw the Wildcats finish 16-17, while much was made about the Name, Image, and Likeness deals on the roster.\n\nHoping for better results, playing with a revamped but still expensive roster, the Wildcats are still struggling in 2025-26. After starting the season 5-0 and having a chance to beat Nebraska, the Wildcats have imploded since Big 12 play began. They began league play 0-5, the program's worst start since 1996-97, and never got any better.\n\nWyatt D. Wheeler covers Kansas State athletics for the USA TODAY Network and Topeka Capital-Journal.

    "description": "Laura Ziegler led Louisville Cardinals women's basketball past the Florida State Seminoles in an ACC college basketball game Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Louisville women’s basketball was forced to deviate from its normal game-opening play — a pass in the low post to Anaya Hardy for a quick layup — against Florida State on Sunday.\n\nThe Seminoles took the look away from the ninth-ranked Cardinals. The only problem was that their double team left Laura Ziegler open. The senior called for the ball and nailed the shot beyond the arc. One minute later, Taj Roberts found Ziegler in the paint for a layup. After one quarter, Ziegler had either scored or assisted on seven of the Cardinals’ eight made field goals while tallying five rebounds.\n\nThe first 10 minutes of Louisville’s ACC game against Florida State (9-17, 4-10 ACC) is what the Saint Joseph’s transfer has been doing all season. And it yielded a similar result to all but four of the Cardinals’ games as Louisville (24-4, 14-1) took down the Seminoles, 88-65, on Sunday at the KFC Yum! Center.\n\nA day after UofL was projected to be a No. 2 seed in the first NCAA Tournament Top 16 reveal, Ziegler showed why as she helped the team build a 34-20 halftime lead. She neared triple-double territory by finishing with 14 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Louisville was +28 when she was on the court, covered every inch by contributing in some way. That ranged from bringing the ball up the floor to battling in the post or getting the outlet pass for a 3-point shot.\n\nZiegler’s versatility is something head coach Jeff Walz saw from her film at Saint Joseph’s. After getting her on campus, he tried her out at the point forward position.\n\n“She passed the ball well,\" Walz said last week. “And she handles it well enough that at the 4 spot, there aren't many 4 players that are going to pick her up full-court. So, the advantage to her then is like, 'Hey, no one's really harassing me a whole bunch.' And then when teams start to put guards on her, she's bigger than they are so she can see over them. And now we're making the pass up to our guard who's being guarded by a post.”\n\nZiegler has been open to any role the team needs her to play and contributes more than just scoring. Her leadership as one of only two seniors on the roster has been invaluable. Beyond the intangibles, Ziegler leads the team in rebounds per game (7.2) and is second in points (11.5) and assists per game (2.9).\n\nHer all-around effort has helped Louisville to one of its most successful seasons over the past few years and will continue to be important with the postseason looming.\n\nLouisville is off Thursday and returns to the KFC Yum! Center to host Virginia at noon next Sunday.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Louisville women's basketball, Laura Ziegler roll past Florida State",

    "fullText": "Neither J.T. Miller nor Vincent Trocheck recorded a point in Team USA’s 5-1 win over Germany on Sunday, but the New York Rangers forwards anchored a perfect penalty kill as the Americans clinched Group C in the preliminaries at the 2016 Milan-Cortina Olympics.\n\nTH\\he United States killed off all three German power plays and improved to nine-for-nine through three contests in these Games. They are the only team that did not allow a power-play goal in the preliminary round.\n\n3-0! ✅✅✅ #WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/CQkF0QVOeB\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 15, 2026\n\nTrocheck and Miller composed the first forward grouping utilized by coach Mike Sullivan, helping the Americans shut down a German power play that featured NHL stars Leon Draisaitl, Tim Stutzle, and Moritz Seider.\n\nMiller received shoulder pats for a shot block late in the third period on USA’s third and final penalty kill. He also connected on a stretch pass with Jack Eichel at the close of the first PK, springing the Vegas Golden Knights center for a breakaway chance — although Eichel was denied by German goalie Maximilian Franzreb.\n\nThe win cemented a perfect 3-0-0 stretch in the preliminary round for the Americans. They won Group C by three points and locked up the No. 2 seed, behind only Canada, who were 3-0-0 with a plus-17 goal differential atop Group A.\n\nMiller logged 12:37 TOI, and Trocheck played a team-low 9:12 Sunday. Each was even with one shot on goal.\n\nTrocheck has two assists — both on game-winning goals — and is plus-two in three games. The 32-year-old center ranks third among all Olympic skaters with a 66.7 face-off percentage, winning 18 of 27 draws. Miller is minus-one and failed to record a point in Group C play — one of four USA skaters yet to hit the score-sheet entering the quarterfinal.\n\nQUARTERFINALS:\n\n(1) Canada vs (8) Czechia/(9) Denmark winner\n(2) USA vs (7) Sweden/(10) Latvia winner\n(3) Slovakia vs (6) Germany/(11) France winner\n(4) Finland vs (5) Switzerland/(12) Italy winner\n\nRe-seeding will take place for semifinals\n\n— Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) February 15, 2026\n\nUSA earned an automatic bid to the Olympic quarterfinals thanks to the win over Germany. The winner of the qualification play-off between No. 7 Sweden and No. 10 Latvia on Tuesday will face the Americans on Wednesday. Should Sweden prevail, Miller and Trocheck will go toe-to-toe with Rangers teammate Mika Zibanejad.\n\nA German team headed by Draisaitl posed the biggest challenge for Team USA in Group C.\n\n“We need to think of this game as a playoff-type atmosphere,” Sullivan told his squad ahead of puck drop.\n\n“That’s exactly what we did,” Minnesota Wild defenseman Brock Faber said postgame. “I thought we played a solid three periods.”\n\nFor the second game in a row, the Americans got off to a clunky start — highlighted by an awkward collision between New Jersey Devils star Jack Hughes and USA captain Auston Matthews on a Team USA power play.\n\nAuston Matthews and Jack Hughes had a massive open ice collision 😳 pic.twitter.com/P0OSRROuD9\n\n— B/R Open Ice (@BR_OpenIce) February 15, 2026\n\nEichel appeared to give the Americans a 1-0 lead in the final minute of the first period, but officials whistled the play dead before his shot, after Matthew Thachuk was checked into the crease, knocking the blocker off of Franzreb.\n\nUndeterred, USA struck before the horn sounded to close the opening frame. Matthews sent a beautiful saucer pass cross-ice, setting up Zach Werenski for a sharp wrister from the left dot at 19:51.\n\n“These games come quick,” Matthews noted at the first intermission. “We didn’t love our effort the first half of the game last night, so we wanted to come out and have a good start, and I thought we did that.”\n\nThey carried that momentum into the second period. After Miller and Trocheck helped kill an Eichel penalty 50 seconds into the frame, USA flipped the tables with a power play of their own.\n\nThis time around, Matthews got to lead the handshake line, gravitating to the front of the net and getting a stick on a shot from Quinn Hughes at 3:25.\n\nFaber gave USA a 3-0 lead at 17:35, quickly firing a high shot from the point that ricocheted off Franzreb’s glove and into the net.\n\nThe Americans made it 4-0 at 1:55 of the third period on a clapper from Tage Thompson, and Matthews tallied his second with another deflection at 6:46.\n\nStutzle netted the lone goal for Germany with a pretty snipe at 11:22.\n\nMatthews posted a game-high three points (two goals, one assist) Sunday; the Toronto Maple Leafs star leads all American skaters with three goals and five points in three games.\n\nA two-piece combo for Auston Matthews. ✌️#WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/vkQzJrWfJb\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 15, 2026\n\nUSA outscored its opponents 16-5 in Group C play. Of course, tougher challenges likely await them — namely, a dominant Canadian squad, fresh off a 10-2 rout of France on Sunday.\n\n“There’s stuff that we need to clean up,” Faber acknowledged. “But overall, I thought we got better as the tournament went on, and that’s what it’s all about. Now it gets real.”\n\nUSA gets two days of rest ahead of their quarterfinal matchup.

    "description": "NFL general managers will have to be creative in coming up with trades this offseason.",
    "fullText": "Player trades in the NFL have become more common in recent years, and one NFL insider believes the trend will continue this offseason.\n\nOn a recent episode of “The Adam Schefter Podcast,” the ESPN NFL reporter said it may be tougher for teams to get impact players this season through traditional means, meaning teams will likely be involved in more trades.\n\n“When we talk about the draft, and we’ll see how it shakes out over time, people aren’t all that excited about the draft,” Schefter said. “We got a free-agent class that’s not really deep. We’ve got a draft that is not considered really deep. You know what that tells me? More trades. That’s what it tells me. It tells me we may get more wheeling and dealing in trades than we’ve had in other years.”\n\nSchefter added that although he has not heard any specific trades that are brewing, he sees the activity around the Nov. 4 trade deadline as an indication of teams willing to make more deals to fix their rosters.\n\nThe trade market could be utilized by teams to acquire quarterbacks. This year’s quarterback draft class is not projected to be as strong as recent years, with Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza expected to go as the first overall pick and Alabama’s Ty Simpson appearing to be the only other quarterback projected as a first-round selection.\n\nKyler Murray (Arizona Cardinals) and Mac Jones (San Francisco 49ers) are expected to be the top targets on the trade market, with Raiders quarterback Geno Smith also expected to garner interest.\n\nOn the defensive side, Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby could be another player moved, although it has been previously reported that a deal for him could come after he finishes recovering from a knee injury he suffered late last season.",

In early February, the Celtics assigned him to participate in portions of a practice with their G League affiliate, the Maine Celtics, at the Auerbach Center. This included his first 5-on-5 scrimmage since the injury, involving rostered players, two-way players, and G Leaguers. Tatum described the session as the next logical step in his plan, noting he felt good afterward and emphasizing a focus on daily improvement without committing to an immediate return. He stressed following the structured progression to ensure full readiness.\n\nTeammate Jaylen Brown offered positive feedback recently, stating that Tatum “looks pretty damn good” based on what he’s observed during this phase. Reports indicate Tatum has ramped up activity aggressively, with no setbacks mentioned, and he continues individual on-court work alongside team integration efforts. Celtics president Brad Stevens has maintained a cautious approach, prioritizing Tatum being fully cleared medically and mentally at 110% before any game action.\n\nWhile a return this season remains possible, Tatum has expressed that he wants to come back at full strength, not as a diminished version of himself. Discussions continue, with no firm timeline set.\n\nCeltics’ Jaylen Brown Reveals UFC Aspirations",

    "description": "The UW-Milwaukee Panthers led for less than 2 minutes on Feb. 15, using the free throw line to climb back against their rival, UW-Green Bay.",
    "fullText": "Because the whistles had been so plentiful, Stevie Elam’s defense in the waning moments had to be perfect.\n\nIt was ‒ depending on who you ask.\n\nAs a foul-ridden contest between rivals came to a close at UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena on Feb. 15, UW-Green Bay guard Preston Ruedinger wisely attacked the rim with his team trailing by a point and the clock under 10 seconds. Expecting at the very least to draw some contact and a whistle, all he instead encountered was Elam stripping the ball away.\n\nThe freshman stripped Ruedinger, then sank two free throws to ice a 75-72 win for the Panthers to avoid what would have been the first sweep to their in-state foes since 2018-19.\n\n\"He had to get that ball pretty clean,\" Milwaukee head coach Bart Lundy said. \"They were driving with force. We had a couple plays before that where it looked like we stopped them and we did get whistled. But Stevie Elam's strength as a true freshman, his hand strength is off the charts; it's probably NFL-level.\"\n\nLundy's counterpart disagreed, to say the least.\n\n\"The last play of the game, just to get the ball they were grabbing us and holding us,\" Phoenix head coach Doug Gottlieb said. \"Again, I understand if you're not calling that, that's fine. You had the exact same play at both ends in the last play of the game.\"\n\nGottlieb paused, ever so briefly, then aggressively slammed his fists into the table atop the dais.\n\n\"The exact same [expletive] play,\" Gottlieb yelled. \"The exact same play.\"\n\nGottlieb was fed up with the officiating crew from the afternoon after receiving a technical foul and seeing his team shoot 18 free throws compared to Milwaukee's 37. He specifically called out the technical he received in the second half with just under 7 minutes to play and his team up three, as well as a loose-ball foul on CJ O'Hara with 4:25 to go and his team up four.\n\n\"I need the new commissioner of the Horizon League to explain to me what a technical foul is when I don't leave the box, I don't curse, I'm not demonstrative,\" Gottlieb said. \"There was nothing, nothing that should have been called a technical foul. I know when I earn one. I did not earn one. The CJ play, we're up [four] points, that dramatically changed the [trajectory] of the game.\"\n\nPostgame tirades aside, the Panthers had to overcome a huge night from Green Bay’s Marcus Hall to do so, as the junior from Schofield, Wisconsin, had 32 points and seven rebounds.\n\nCentral to Milwaukee’s efforts in doing so: free throws and Chandler Jackson, who scored 23 points.\n\nTwenty-four of the Panthers' free throws came in the second half, and they hit 22 of them – despite being one of the worst free-throw shooting teams in the country at 68.5% entering the day.\n\nMilwaukee led for only 1 minute, 53 seconds in total.\n\nAfter cutting the lead to one three times prior in the final minutes, the Panthers took the lead with 69 seconds left when Esyah Pippa-White was fouled going for a defensive rebound and hit a pair of free throws.\n\nOn the other end, Hall corralled his own miss and laid it back up with 45 seconds left to put the Phoenix up 72-71.\n\nBut Amar Augillard wisely drove to the basket on the other end, where he drew a foul much to Gottlieb's chagrin and hit Milwaukee’s 19th and 20th free throws of the half.\n\n\"Our end, [if] you don't want to call a foul, he drove into traffic, whatever,\" the Phoenix second-year coach and former radio host said. \"It's the exact same play as the other end. Could not be more similar. And yet every time they drove in there it was a foul, and every time we did it was a miss.\"\n\nMilwaukee shot 19 more free throws than Green Bay despite drawing only five more fouls.\n\nJackson went 8 for 8 from the stripe as he finished two points shy of his career-high of 25 points, which he set in Milwaukee’s most recent game, Feb. 10 at IU Indy.\n\nInitially thought of as a likely redshirt candidate, Jackson has become arguably the heavily injured Panthers' most-consistent scorer of late. He’s averaging 14.1 points over his past eight games.\n\n\"To see Chandler from June to where he is now, he's just a different guy, different player,\" Lundy said. \"When we inserted Chandler, we really inserted him for his communication. He helps everyone get better defensively. That's what got him the opportunity and everything has grown from that. It wasn't like he was in practice scoring at will on everyone. He talked. He communicated. He cared.\"\n\nElam was the only other Milwaukee player to reach double-digit scoring, finishing with 11 points.\n\nWith the win, the Panthers moved a half-game clear of Youngstown State and Cleveland State for eighth place in the Horizon League, which matters because the 10th and 11th place teams face off in a play-in for the conference tournament.\n\nGreen Bay left the building, meanwhile, in a tie for third – and forcefully demanding answers from the conference.\n\n\"All we ask is that there's a fair game. That's what we ask,\" Gottlieb said. \"CJ O'Hara goes and gets an offensive rebound, their player dives at his legs and CJ gets called for a foul. I need [Jill Bodensteiner] at the league, our new commissioner, to explain to me the disparity in the officiating. That's what I need explained to me.\n\n\"I have no problem with their team, their staff. They played hard. They did what they do. They played tough and they played aggressive. I need somebody to explain to me, just those two. There are others I have massive issues with, including every time we touched them there was a foul in the second half.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Doug Gottlieb goes on postgame tirade after Milwaukee beats Green Bay",

Hannah Hidalgo led the way with 19 points to go along with eight rebounds, six steals and six assists. Cassandre Prosper and Iyana Moore each scored 14 and Malaya Cowles added 13.\n\nThe Irish never trailed in the first frame and led by as many as eight at 10-2 just 4 minutes into the contest before holding a three-point advantage with the score 17-14 following the opening 10 minutes of play. Hidalgo led Notre Dame with seven points in the quarter.\n\nNC State made a layup to start the second quarter to cut the Irish lead to one but Notre Dame roared back by scoring eight straight to push the advantage to nine at 25-16. Gisela Sanchez connected on two shots from beyond the arc to spur the run.\n\nThe Wolfpack connected on a jumper to trim the Irish advantage to seven and then Notre Dame took complete control of the rest of the half. The Irish outscored NC State 22-9 over the remaining 7:30 of play to take a commanding 47-27 lead into the halftime break.\n\nAll seven Notre Dame players that saw the court scored in the second stanza scored, led by Sanchez and Prosper who each recorded six points.\n\nThe Irish shot the ball well over the first 20 minutes of play, going 16-for-31 from the field and 7-of-12 from three-point range.\n\nNotre Dame didn’t allow NC State to make a run to get back in the game coming out of the half, as it outscored the visitors 18-15 in the third quarter to take a 65-42 lead into the final 10 minutes of action.\n\nNC State managed to score 25 points in the final frame but it was not enough, as the Irish cruised to the 79-67 victory.\n\nNotre Dame’s defense was everywhere and gave the Wolfpack fits, causing 22 in the win, which marks the most turnovers by NC State this season. The Irish capitalized by outscoring NC State 24-2 in points off turnovers.\n\nNotre Dame improves to 11-6 against NC State in the all-time series.\n\nThe 30-point second quarter marks ND’s sixth 30-point quarter of the season and first in ACC play.\n\nThe Irish handed NC State its worst loss of the season on Sunday in the 12-point victory.\n\nNotre Dame finished with 17 steals, marking the 19th time the team has recorded double-digit steals in a game this season.\n\nThe Irish never trailed for the duration of the 40 minutes.\n\nHidalgo has finished in double figures in the scoring column in all 92 games of her career, the longest streak in program history.\n\nSunday marked the 12th game this season that Hidalgo finished with five or more steals.\n\nProsper finished with five steals, her second highest output of the season.\n\nThe Fighting Irish hit the road for a midweek matchup against Wake Forest at 6 p.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 19 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

    "description": "Seahawks with a stunning hire to run their offense",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks became victims of their own success this season when the Las Vegas Raiders hired away offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak to be their next head coach. With Kubiak gone, this presented an obvious hole that needed filling in their coaching staff. Seattle was widely expected to promote from within, and understandably so. However, the Seahawks often \"zag\" when folks expect them to \"zig\" and they did so once more.\n\nOn Sunday, it was reported by ESPN's Adam Schefter that Seattle is expected to hire San Francisco 49ers tight end coach Brian Fleury to be their next offensive coordinator. This was a name that was not on anyone's radar... anyone except Mike Macdonald, of course.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Nick Wagoner and Brady Henderson, Fleury was heavily involved in San Francisco's ground attack, as his official position last season was tight ends/run game coordinator. Henderson also notes with Fleury coming from the same Shanahan coaching line as Kubiak, the continuity will be kept largely in tact for quarterback Sam Darnold. This was exactly the logic for hiring within, so going with Fleury does make sense in this regard.\n\nFleury also brings intimate knowledge of Seattle's most hated rival. He's been with the Niners since 2019 in various coaching roles, and of course also knows how best to attack both the Rams and Arizona Cardinals. Although, this will be Fleury's first time as an offensive coordinator, and with Mike Macdonald focusing primarily on defense, he will have a lot on his plate as the one in full control of the offense.\n\nThe Seahawks will begin their title defense with a rookie offensive coordinator, but if Mike Macdonald's earned anything it's our trust he's made the right call.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks moves: 49ers TE coach Brian Fleury new offensive coordinator",

    "fullText": "Logan Webb makes his intentions for the upcoming season clear originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's been four seasons since the San Francisco Giants made the postseason, and during that 2021 playoff run, they suffered a crushing defeat to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games of the NLDS.\n\nThat was the team's standout pitcher. Logan Webb's third season, which has been the only postseason appearance of his career, is entering his eighth season, and the ace is ready for that to change.\n\n\"I'm tired of finishing around .500. I know fans are tired of it. None of us is happy about it, either. I've been here the longest now, and it's frustrating,\" Webb exclaimed.\n\nMore: Giants sign former Guardians outfielder in late free agent move\n\nThe frustration Webb speaks of is justified, since being a mediocre team can be worse than being at the bottom of the barrel, especially if the team remains the same.\n\nHowever, whenever one of the best players on the team is stating how much he is tired of losing and individual is not enough more and winning is the top priority, it can end up lighting a positive fire under the team to go out there and turn things around, which is what the franchise needs as that 2021 postseason is the only appearance for San Francisco in the last nine seasons, but before that the team had won three World Series titles over five seasons from 2010-2014.\n\nIf the Giants don't begin to turn their fortunes around, that could start to upset Webb to the point where he may eventually want to be traded to a better situation. A dominant starting pitcher like Webb does not come around as often as one might think.\n\nBased on the resume that Webb has built for himself, he will be play a huge role in the team having success if that happens this season, especially if the all-star can have anywhere close to the season that he had last year, where he recorded a 15-11 record, 3.22 ERA, and 224 strikeouts, which was good for third most in the league behind only Tarik Skubal and Garrett Crochet.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nAn Edwin Diaz nightmare looms for the Mets\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nWe now know what the ABS challenge system strike zone will look like\n\nSpencer Strider's finish to 2025 changes everything for Braves",

    "fullText": "BOCA RATON — Florida Atlantic’s men’s basketball team continued its shocking free fall on Feb. 15. The Owls lost 83-81 in overtime to first-place South Florida in an American Conference state showdown.\n\nKanaan Carlyle, playing for the time since Feb. 1, missed a game-winning three-point attempt in the final seconds to seal the Owls’ (14-12, 6-7) fate.\n\nAfter starting out conference play 6-1 and sitting in first place, FAU’s losing streak has now reached six games, and the Owls have fallen to 10th in the razor-thin standings.\n\nMore college basketball: Florida basketball makes another statement in SEC race by dispatching Kentucky\n\nCarlyle scored 15 points on 5-for-13 shooting in his return. Devin Vanterpool led FAU with 26 points, and USF (18-8, 10-3) was led by Wes Enis with a game-high 27 points.\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to Rice on Feb. 11, the Owls were able to go toe-to-toe with the best team in the American, but couldn’t secure the victory.\n\n“I think we’re going to get hot,” FAU coach John Jakus said. “We’ll keep it going.”\n\nFAU will be back in action on Feb. 18 for a road matchup in San Antonio with the UTSA Roadrunners.\n\nHere are the takeaways from the latest loss:\n\nPerhaps the most notable change for the Owls was the return of starting point guard Kanaan Carlyle, who has been out for three of FAU’s last four games due to a calf injury.\n\nCarlyle looked healthy while knocking down 3 of his 8 three-pointers in 36 minutes of action. The junior had a chance to win it in the closing seconds of overtime, but came up just short from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Owls’ offense hummed much more soundly than it has in recent weeks. Five Owls — Carlyle, Vanterpool, Josiah Parker, Devin Williams and Isaiah Elohim — scored in double figures, but it wasn’t enough to take down the top team in the American.\n\nNonetheless, Jakus is confident that Carlyle’s return will make life easier heading into the final stretch of the regular season.\n\n“You can tell with Kanaan back, there’s a couple things that are pretty distinctive,” Jakus said. “There was just a flow of the way we play when they play together.”\n\nAmid a deflating losing streak, Jakus opted to make an adjustment to the team’s starting lineup by inserting Parker in place of the struggling Xander Pintelon.\n\nParker entered the matchup averaging 12.5 points and 7.5 rebounds per game against American Conference opponents and had been particularly exceptional of late, averaging 17.3 points and 9.0 rebounds per game in February.\n\nParker posted a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double to go along with two blocks. The performance was histhird-consecutive double-double, fifth of the season.\n\nHis upward trajectory has been arguably the only positive to come about during FAU’s losing skid, with Jakus acknowledging the time had come for Parker to start.\n\n“He’s the best freshman in the league,” Jakus said. “He’s averaging 17 and 10 over the last five games and we haven't won, so at a certain point I’m going to make a change in the starting lineup.\n\n“I liked bringing him off the bench. I thought there was a punch to that when we were 5-1. It was fun and cute to have him coming off the bench, but it’s not cute right now. We need guys to perform.”\n\nUSF’s Wes Enis and Joseph Pinion did their best “Splash Brothers” impression, knocking down a combined nine three-pointers. In the first half, it was Enis who got hot from downtown, scoring 18 of his 27 points while hitting four of his eight three-point tries.\n\nSouth Florida shot 36 percent from the floor, and 26 percent from three as a team, before halftime, but Enis’ shooting kept the game tight.\n\nIn the second half, it was Pinion’s turn to light up the Owls from beyond the arc. After scoring 4 points on 2-for-7 shooting from the floor and 0-for-3 from downtown in the first half, Pinion scored 12 points, hitting all four of his shots from three-point range in the latter half.\n\nIn a game in which USF made 13 of 39 layups, it was the marksmanship of Enis and Pinion that led to the Owls' demise. Both players hit numerous shots that were several feet beyond the three-point line, stretching FAU’s defense to the max as the Owls struggled to contain the long-range shooters.\n\n“Some of it is the actions, some of it is falling asleep for half a second, and then some of it is the fact that they can invert the floor all the way to the volleyball line,” Jakus said. “I think the very worst mistake you make is when you’re too low, and you let them see one go in. If you’re low, it’s over.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Beach Post: USF Bulls edge FAU Owls in overtime in American Conference basketball",

    "description": "Syla Swords and Olivia Olson combined for 47 points to help Michigan women’s basketball team secure a 86-65 victory over Michigan State, the largest win in rivalry history:",
    "fullText": "Two weeks ago, the No. 7 Michigan women’s basketball eked out a three-point overtime win in East Lansing against No. 13 Michigan State.\n\nSunday afternoon told another story. With a dominant second quarter in which the Wolverines outscored the Spartans, 26-9, Michigan (22-4 overall, 13-2 Big Ten) seized momentum and never looked back to defeat Michigan State (20-6, 9-6), 86-65.\n\n“They jumped on us right away,” head coach Kim Barnes Arico said. “We weren’t able to get stops, and then we kind of settled in and really got stops for the rest of the game. Our second-quarter defense was outstanding, but I thought our defense and the way we forced turnovers all game was really exceptional. Olivia (Olson) and Syla (Swords) were both tremendous, but they had a lot of support from their teammates as well.”\n\nTrailing 21-15 following the first quarter, the Wolverines had to make an adjustment. The Spartans were driving consistently and scoring in the paint — all but three of their points resulted from paint points or free throws — while Michigan struggled to get clean looks offensively. With intense ball pressure, Michigan State sped up the Wolverines, impairing their shot selection. Despite collecting offensive rebounds, rather than resetting the offense, Michigan failed to convert on a few second chances.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Wolverines turned that trend on its head.\n\n“Second quarter, it was wild,” Michigan State head coach Robyn Fralick said. “… It was a lot of self-inflicted, just playing a little bit sped up, which we hadn’t early. And then that got us just out of rhythm, out of sorts. I mean, you can’t turn the ball over that much and be effective. And then in the second quarter, we gave up so many second shots, too, so that makes the game really hard.”\n\nInstead of speeding Michigan up, the Spartans were chasing an unsustainable pace themselves. They coughed up the ball 12 times, some unforced errors like travels or inaccurate passes, and others a direct product of the Wolverines’ sticky fingers.\n\nLed by senior guard Brooke Quarles Daniels, Michigan ramped up the pressure, pouncing on Michigan State’s mistakes and converting them into transition points.\n\n“This needs to go somewhere, but (Brooke) needs to be on that Defensive Player of the Year list,” Swords said. “She is the best defender in the country. She fuels our defense. She allows Liv to pick up full court, allows us to have a rest, because she’s picking up the best player anywhere she goes. So she really fuels the way we play, the style of play, the fast pace, the fun pace that comes from Brooke, so her name needs to be heard. She needs to be on any and every list out there.”\n\nWith the Swords-proclaimed DPOY leading the charge, the Wolverines converted 12 turnovers into 14 points, coupled with 11 second-chance points on six offensive rebounds to shoot past the Spartans with a 26-9 second quarter in which Michigan State attempted just seven total shots. The frame was most prominently marked by a stretch from 6:50 to the three-second mark of the first half in which Michigan outscored the Spartans, 19-2.\n\nMichigan State averaged 12.7 turnovers per game, with 20 as its previous season high. With 16 at halftime and finishing with 24, turnovers were the tale of the tape that separated the Wolverines for good.\n\nBut that separation factor was compounded by offensive efficiency. Michigan took better shots, and those clean looks were a byproduct of transition offense and success on the glass. Strong ball movement set up Swords, who sank two key triples to punctuate the game-defining run. Swords’ 10 second-quarter points surpassed the Spartans’ total on her own, and combined with an efficient 47 percent from the floor for 24 points overall.\n\nThe Swords-Olson tandem electrified a season-best crowd of 11,627 for a combined 47 points, including perfect 12-for-12 combined from the free throw line. Olson’s trademark midrange jumper and Swords’ splashy outside shots overpowered the Spartans’ defense, taking what was given and exploiting opportunities. Olson finished with her seventh consecutive 20-point game.\n\nWith former Michigan great Naz Hillmon in attendance for her jersey retirement, with “00” hanging from the rafters — a major reason why Olson and Swords chose Michigan — the Wolverines of today put on a show. Securing the season sweep in both the highest-ranked matchup and largest margin of victory in rivalry history for Michigan, surpassing a mark set by Hillmon’s team itself in 2020, the Wolverines wrote a new chapter in the rivalry.",

    "fullText": "One of the biggest stories for the host nation Italy at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games has been the amazing comeback story for alpine skier Federica Brignone. Many thought she would not be healthy enough to compete on the Italian slopes this month.\n\nBrignone is not just a competitor at the Winter Olympic Games at the moment, but a dominant one. She has come away with two individual gold medals with victories in the women’s giant slalom and women’s super giant slalom.\n\nBefore Sunday no skier had ever won the women’s super giant slalom and women’s giant slalom at the same Olympic Winter Games.\n\nIt has been accomplished twice on the men’s side. Markus Wasmeier of Germany won the giant slalom and super giant slalom at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer, and Herman Maier won these same two alpine skiing events at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano.\n\nThe reason why this accomplishment is noteworthy is because of the differences between a giant slalom race and super giant slalom race. The giant slalom race is a lot more technical, while the super giant slalom is associated with downhill more, and is a speed race.\n\nBrignone tore her anterior cruciate ligament during a giant slalom race at the Italian National Alpine Skiing Championships in Val di Fissa, Italy on April 3.\n\nInitially, Brignone was diagnosed with a broken tibia and broken fibula. During the operation, it was determined that Brignone had also ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament according to Lena Smirnova of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nBrignone’s crash in Italy came 10 months prior to Lindsey Vonn’s spectacular crash in Italy in the women’s downhill to begin the 2026 Olympic Winter Games.\n\nBrignone’s super giant slalom win on Thursday came with a time of 1:23.41. She beat her nearest opponent, silver medalist Romane Miradoli of France by 0.41 seconds.\n\nThen on Saturday in the giant slalom, Brignone beat silver medalists Sara Hector of Sweden and Thea Louise Stjernesund of Norway, by 0.62 seconds. Brignone’s winning time was 2:13.50.\n\nThe host nation now has eight gold medals. There is another Italian woman with two individual gold medals. That is Francesca Lollobrigida, who won gold in the women’s 3000 metres and women’s 5000 metres.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Federica Brignone comes back from torn ACL to win two Olympic gold medals appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "FC Bayern has talent in between the sticks.",
    "fullText": "As Bayern Munich continues to balance legacy with long-term planning, CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen offered thoughtful insight into one of the club’s most emotionally charged questions— the future of club legend Manuel Neuer and the rise of his potential successor, Jonas Urbig.\n\nNeuer, of course, suffered a calf injury in the team’s 3-0 victory over Werder Bremen on Saturday and will be replaced by Urbig in the starting XI until the veteran can return. Speaking about Neuer’s situation, Dreesen emphasized patience and respect for a player whose performances continue to defy time.\n\n“Manuel will be 40 on March 27. You wouldn’t believe that if you’ve followed him in recent games and seen how many incredible saves he made. We spoke early on, and he wants to give himself time and we also want to give him and ourselves time. We’ll discuss things calmly during the season and see what happens next,” Dreesen said on a recent appearance on BR24Sport.\n\nThe quote reflects Bayern’s typically measured approach to transitions involving iconic figures. Rather than forcing a timeline, the club appears committed to allowing Neuer’s performances—and his own feelings—to guide the decision. Given his enduring quality, that restraint feels both respectful and practical. Few goalkeepers in world football history have maintained elite standards so deep into their careers, and Neuer’s continued influence in big moments makes any immediate succession plan far from straightforward.\n\nAt the same time, Bayern is clearly preparing for the future. Dreesen spoke warmly about Urbig’s development and, perhaps more importantly, the relationship forming between the young goalkeeper and the veteran he may one day replace.\n\n“Jonas is doing a great job. The chemistry between him and Manu is excellent, which is particularly important. I think Manu has made it his mission to build Jonas up as his successor and pass on his experience to him. You can see that in training when they talk to each other. That makes us happy. Jonas has already shown his great potential in the games he played. He just needs to gain experience through match practice. He’s played a lot more games than those before him. I hope he continues this way,” Dreesen said.\n\nThis mentorship element is striking. Bayern’s greatest generational handovers—from past leaders to new cornerstones—have often worked best when knowledge was shared rather than guarded. If Neuer is actively shaping Urbig’s growth, the eventual transition could feel less like an ending and more like a continuation of standards.\n\nFor supporters, the message is reassuring on multiple levels. Neuer is still trusted, valued, and performing at a remarkable level. Meanwhile, the club is not standing still; it is cultivating the next era with intention and care.\n\nIn true Bayern fashion, sentiment and strategy are moving together. Whether Neuer extends his story for another season or gradually passes the gloves forward, the process appears calm, respectful, and deliberate—exactly the way a club of Bayern’s stature prefers to shape its future.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Vinicius Junior has had a difficult 18 months on the pitch, but there are signs that he’s returning to his best level at Real Madrid. He’s been in good form over the last few weeks, and it comes at an important time too, considering his uncertain future at the Bernabeu.\n\nVinicius is out of contract in June 2027, and so far, there has been no breakthrough regarding a new deal. Despite this, he’s made it clear that he’s very happy at Real Madrid, as he told Ibai Llanos (via Diario AS).\n\n“I’m very happy. Playing for Real Madrid, having the life I have and my family makes me happy. Being happy on and off the pitch is the best.”\n\nVinicius’ form has suffered since Kylian Mbappe joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2024, but according to the man himself, the pair have a great relationship both on and off the pitch. He also revealed that he was pushing the Frenchman to join in the years before he quit Paris for Madrid.\n\n“Every summer I wrote to him: ‘When are you coming?’ I acted as an agent. With Bellingham I did too. I want to play with the best to have more options to win. We spend more time with each other than with our family. We have to have a good relationship.”\n\nVinicius also responded to a question on how he manages to keep his feet on the ground after becoming a big name in football at such a young age.\n\n“When we are very young we don’t learn to be famous. I came out of nowhere to be famous and not be able to go out on the street. The good side is that people love you a lot, but the bad thing is the press and the rival fans. But I love (rival fan whistles). We train for these games. In the moments of pressure is when the best players stand out, and at Real Madrid, we are ready.”\n\nVinicius, who spoke with Ronald Araujo during the Barcelona defender’s recent break from football, revealed how he takes care of his own mental health.\n\n“You have to listen to everything, not just the good things.”",

    "fullText": "Last week, I wrote a post with a question of the day asking what questions you would like asked. One of the submissions was from our very own sdphinsfan. sdphinsfan pointed out the fact that the NFL has consistently adjusted the rules over the years to favor offensive production. The assumption being that exciting offenses are what the fans most want to see. But despite the league pushing for offensive production while finding ways to restrict defenses, it still seems as if defense wins championships more often than not. It’s not to say that you don’t need offensive production in the NFL, but all things equal, the postseason games tend to go to the teams that dominate on defense. This is also somewhat in contrast to the regular season, where a team with a dominant offense can win a high percentage of its games, even while fielding a subpar defense.\n\nSo the now obvious Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nIn the NFL, where the rules and the game in general are now geared toward a higher rate of offensive production and, in turn, higher scoring, why are NFL Championships still won on the backs of dominant defenses?\n\nPlease share your thougths and answers in the comment section below-",

    "title": "Implications of the Zac Gallen Signing",
    "description": "Our panelists discuss the implications of the Zac Gallen signing, how it will impact the rotation, and more!",
    "fullText": "DBacksEurope: It is probably true that Gallen improves the 2026 rotation. 2025 first half Gallen was probably a worser version of the pitcher that he actually is, but we’ve seen Zac becoming increasingly worse and frustrated over the past few seasons, to an extent where we had to conclude that he wasn’t the ace we thought he once was (going to be). The longer Gallen was unsigned, the more likely it would be that he would end up in Arizona again. The QO was a no-brainer for me, so I think it is a good signing. Boras probably tried to pull a Montgomery here again, but thankfully the Diamondbacks didn’t fall for that one. I think there is still a lack of overall quality on this roster that will prevent us from becoming a serious wild card contender.\n\nJames: It’s fine. I don’t love it. I don’t hate it. Frankly, there are no better starting pitchers on the market at this point. Nor were there any better pitchers earlier in free agency that were coming for less money. With the team being up against the financial wall they are, I am actually a little bit surprised they took a gamble on bringing Gallen back. But then, they were desperate for another starter and this also helps the gutted bullpen. In that regard, this is a wise signing. Mike Hazen and his staff are mad if they think Soroka is going to be able to provide 120 IP out of the rotation. He might not even reach 80 IP.\n\n1AZfan1: Knee jerk reaction is this is good for the 2026 Diamondbacks. Given the state of the roster (especially the projected IL) and looking around the rest of the NL, the best chance to make the postseason would come through some exceptional individual performances by players well above their projection. Gallen isn’t likely to be a 3.50 ERA guy next year, but he’s got a better shot at it then anyone else available on the market.\n\nBen: This pairing always made sense. He’s functionally spent his entire career with the D-Backs and he’s clearly pretty comfortable with the franchise and the environment. That said, this is a floor-raising rather than a ceiling-raising move. Clearly, the rotation and roster are better with Gallen than without him, but it’s up to him and the coaching staff to try and fix the fact that his fastball went from one of the best to well-below average over the course of just a couple of years.\n\nWesley: I find it hilarious that he could and probably should have taken the qualifying offer and we’d be in the exact same position as we are right now.. Outside of that, it’s fine. Hopefully, Gallen didn’t spend the whole winter just appearing on podcasts, and actually spent some time sorting out whatever mechanical/mental issue that lead to his disaster of a 2025 season.\n\nDano: Kneejerk reaction was a booming “Meh,” with full echoes and reverb. Also, like Wesley, I appreciate the inherent hilarity of it. Beyond that, I expect him to pitch over the season much like he pitched in 2025–some good, some bad, truly mediocre performance for a wannabe “staff ace,” but serviceable enough for a third or fourth starter. Hence the “Meh.” In any event, he’ll likely be better than Soroka would have been taking the mound every fifth day, so that should be nice.\n\nSpencer: It’s perfectly fine. There’s upside and floor. The price is adequate in that 2020s Kendrick way. I’ve never understood why fans seem so focused on how he has a negative ego. Personally I’ve never seen that but I also watch from the east coast so I will be first in line to admit I often fall asleep by the third inning (10pm start time when wake up is at 4:15 is just not feasible). I’d rather have a starter with a chip on their shoulder than not if we’re talking mid range with ceiling.\n\nDBacksEurope: I don’t think there is a scenario where E-Rod, with $40MM left on his contract, isn’t starting for the Diamondbacks in 2026 as long as his ERA stays below 6.00. So, this is probably worse news for Soroka, who will only be here one year. Although he will probably start in long relief, he will see plenty of action with Pfaadt and E-Rod shitting the bed more often than not, providing a podium for him to perform, just like Nelson did last year. Then injuries will occur and he’ll get his starts.\n\nJames: I guess it depends on how one defines bad news. Soroka is the one being bumped from the rotation. Expecting him to have been an effective, 30-game starter was always a bit bonkers to begin with. If the team keeps the entire rotation healthy and does not spend a few weeks running a 6-man rotation until someone gets injured, then Soroka goes to the bullpen, where he can provide some heat in middle, low-leverage relief. When the inevitable E-Rod injury occurs, Soroka might get some starts. Or, if he is effective in relief (where he is better suited), they can leave him in the bullpen and bring up Drake.\n\n1AZfan1: Knee jerk reaction here is Soroka is the odd man out of the Opening Day rotation, but that is only provided that there are no injuries during Spring Training. It’s likely, or at least a coin flip’s chance, that one of the 6 possible starters will suffer some injury in Spring and the decision will be made for Torey on who will start the year in the rotation.\n\nBen: I tend to agree with the rest of the Roundtable: Soroka likely is the first one out of the rotation and bumped to a swingman/long-relief role where he’s had some success over the course of his career. Of course, it’s near-impossible that these six will be the same starters at the Trade Deadline let alone the end of the season and Soroka will almost certainly get a few chances to start if he stays healthy.\n\nWesley: Just to further echo what the others have already said, I’d say Soroka is the odd man out. I am much more comfortable with him as a BP arm or spot starter than I am as part of the starting rotation.\n\nDano: Soroka definitely, at least if Soroka really wants to reestablish himself as a starter. That said, it seems like he found a good deal of success pitching out of the bullpen, so it might wind up being better for him if he can firmly establish himself as a good long reliever/swingman.\n\nSpencer: Unfortunately I think Soroka will be pushed out of the rotation. Assuming ERod somehow stays healthy. But if the goal is to win games it should be the opposite. He’s 5 years younger and his overall production is closer to ERods than you might think if you only go off vibes rather than results. That’s not to say ERod hasn’t had the better career thus far, but if I’m going for ceiling and floor, I’m riding the potential of Soroka knowing he’s only good for 20 starts at most. That way ERod can try to remain healthier than average by only throwing a few pitches at a time. But I suspect the goal isn’t necessarily to win this season and therefore ERod will get the rotation spot and Soroka will be risked in the bullpen.",

    "description": "Collin Morikawa ended a 28-month winless streak, securing his seventh career Tour title at the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am with a dramatic birdie.",
    "fullText": "PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — Collin Morikawa birdied the 72nd hole to win the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am by one stroke over Min Woo Lee and Sepp Straka.\n\nHe ended a 28-month winless spell with his seventh career Tour title, shooting a 5-under 67 at Pebble Beach Golf Links and finished with a 72-hole aggregate of 22-under 266.\n\nMorikawa surged into contention on Saturday, hitting all 18 greens in regulation, pouring in 11 birdies and shooting 10-under 62. How good was Morikawa’s ball-striking? It was just the third time he hit all 18 greens in his career and he gained 6.472 strokes on the field in approach shots, the best Strokes Gained: Approach number of his career, the best in AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am history and the second best in the Shotlink era (dating to 2004).\n\nAfter a subpar Ryder Cup for Team USA, Morikawa started the season with a missed cut in Hawaii and a lackluster T-54 last week in Phoenix. That made nine straight starts dating to late June without a top-10 finish. But his swing coach, Rick Sessinghaus, gave him the pep talk he needed on Friday night and Morikawa put on a stripe show on the weekend.\n\n“He’s way more of a feel player than people realize. Everybody thinks he’s kind of a robot, and he is a robot so-to-speak,” Morikawa’s caddie Mark Urbanek said. “He just kind of got back to hitting shots and being a shot maker, and that’s what he does best.”\n\nOn a day when nine different golfers were within two strokes of the lead as the leaders headed to the back nine, Morikawa made four birdies and one bogey coming home, including birdies at three of the last four holes. But he made a bogey at 17 to drop back into a tie with Lee, who shot 65, at 20 under. Morikawa drove it in the fairway and had 235 yards to the green. Then he had to wait 20 minutes for Jacob Bridgeman to get a ruling, take a drop and wait for his ball to remain still in the wind long enough for him to putt out. Morikawa paced, stared at the beautiful backdrop that is Carmel Bay and sifted through potential baby names. “Not Bogey,” he later cracked.\n\nWaiting behind the 18th green to congratulate his friend was Russell Henley, who had chipped in at the Arnold Palmer Invitational 11 months ago to edge Morikawa by a stroke. Henley was confident that Morikawa would get the job done. “He’s got a 4-iron. That’s his club,” Henley said.\n\nAdded Straka, who eagled the last to tie for second and played alongside Morikawa in the final threesome: “He's one of the best iron players of our generation probably. He likes to cut it so it makes it even harder with that wind blowing 25, 30 off your left. Yeah, that is a pretty special shot to put it away there.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Collin Morikawa wins AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, ends winless streak",

    "fullText": "North Carolina opened its 2026 baseball season with a three-game sweep of Indiana that quickly turned into a showcase for both its revamped lineup and deep pitching staff.\n\nThe Tar Heels opened the season 3-0, while the Hoosiers fell to 0-3. With numerous first-time starters and key transfers, North Carolina used timely extra-base hits and strong pitching to control the series.\n\nHere’s what happened in all three games\n\nNorth Carolina opened its 2026 baseball season with a 9-4 win over Indiana at Boshamer Stadium.\n\nThe Tar Heels used three runs in the fifth and six in the sixth to break open a game that began as a pitchers’ duel, with both starters allowing only three hits combined. The win gives Carolina a 1-0 edge in the all-time series.\n\nRight-hander Jason DeCaro took care of business on the mound as he gave up two hits, no runs and struck out seven over five innings while the lineup, featuring eight first-time starters in Carolina blue, found its rhythm.\n\nTransfer Jake Schaffner drove in the season’s first run with a sacrifice fly before preseason All-America shortstop Gavin Gallaher ripped a two-run triple, the second triple of his career.\n\nWho else but @GallaherGavin to break this thing wide open?!?! \n\nTriple puts us up 3-0 😤 pic.twitter.com/s7Ga9j2uxD\n\n— Carolina Baseball (@DiamondHeels) February 13, 2026\n\nIndiana cut the deficit to two in the sixth, but UNC answered with six runs in the bottom half to put the game out of reach.\n\nFreshman Tyler Howe recorded his first career hit with an RBI double, followed by a two-run double from Colin Hynek and a triple by Schaffner to left-center.\n\nReliever Boston Flannery allowed one hit over 2 1/3 innings in his longest career outing for the Tar Heels.\n\nNorth Carolina won both games in its doubleheader sweep of Indiana, rolling to a 12-2, seven-inning run-rule win in Game 1 and walking off 4-3 in 11 innings in Game 2 at Boshamer Stadium on Saturday.\n\nThe Tar Heels extended their streak to 12 straight opening-weekend series wins, nine of them sweeps. It was the first time in program history that they recorded a run-rule and an extra-innings game in the same series.\n\nIn Game 1, an all-around dominant effort produced UNC’s first run-rule of the season.\n\nErik Paulsen had a fantastic day at the plate as he drove in the first run of the doubleheader in the first inning, then broke the game open with a three-run homer in the fifth — the Tar Heels’ first home run of 2026. He finished with five RBIs.\n\nFirst one of the year was a no doubter 🚀@Erik_Paulsen44 says hello and goodbye! pic.twitter.com/2UVdn9BxJw\n\n— Carolina Baseball (@DiamondHeels) February 14, 2026\n\nLeft-hander Folger Boaz allowed two hits and one run with six strikeouts over five innings.\n\nA six-run sixth, highlighted by a two-run triple from Colin Hynek and another triple from Jake Schaffner, put the game away. The Tar Heels totaled four triples over the first two games of the series, their most in back-to-back games since at least March 2015.\n\nGame 2 turned into a pitching and defense showcase. Ryan Lynch, officially joining the weekend rotation, settled after a first-inning run to work five innings with three hits, one run and six strikeouts.\n\nReliever Matthew Matthijs, back from Tommy John surgery suffered April 4, 2025, threw 2.1 innings, looked like his old self as he allowed one hit and struck out three.\n\nAn error behind him helped Indiana score twice, but North Carolina tied it in the ninth when second baseman Aiden Stewart misplayed a grounder, allowing two runs to score and sending the game to extra innings.\n\nBonus baseball at the Bosh 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/PywH6xay1u pic.twitter.com/uhmL5RrcQ3\n\n— Carolina Baseball (@DiamondHeels) February 14, 2026\n\nIn the 11th, catcher Macon Winslow launched a 398-foot line-drive homer off the scoreboard for UNC’s first opening-weekend walk-off since 2020.\n\nNorth Carolina hosts Richmond on Tuesday at 4 p.m. ET on ACCNX.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Baseball: Diamond Heels sweep Indiana to open 2026 campaign",

    "fullText": "News broke on Feb. 4 that Jeff Stoutland, the Philadelphia Eagles’ run game and offensive line coach, will not return to the team next season. The report from ESPN’s Tim McManus came as a complete shock to fans.\n\nStoutland has coached Philadelphia’s offensive line since 2013. During his tenure, he’s played a key role in developing one of the league’s best units. Jason Kelce, Jordan Mailata, and Mekhi Becton are just some of the players who greatly benefited from Soutland’s guidance.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Mailata, a current star for the Eagles’ offensive line, said he is “heartbroken” by the news. Additionally, veterans Lane Johnson and Landon Dickerson are reportedly contemplating retirement, which is likely tied to Stoutland’s departure.\n\nThis unexpected exit is shaking up Philadelphia’s offseason plans and has left fans with many questions.\n\nThe timing of Stoutland’s exit in relation to the hiring of new offensive coordinator Sean Mannion may not be a coincidence.\n\nNBC Sports’ Dave Zangaro noted how Mannion’s staff-building decisions this offseason could indicate a significant shift Philadelphia’s offensive identity for 2026.  Rumors are circulating that Mannion wants the reins of the offense entirely to himself. As he brings in several new coaches and staff members who share his vision, perhaps Stoutland saw the writing on the wall that changes are coming, and he wasn’t going to be a part of them.\n\nStoutland’s frustrations with Philadelphia’s operation date back to last season. He was reportedly irritated with the Eagles’ offense and his lack of contribution to the group towards the end of the year. In these reports, it’s said that head coach Nick Sirianni and former offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo had complete control over the offense in the final few games.\n\nCayden Steele at NJ.com wrote about how the divide late last season played a role in the separation. According to Steele, Stoutland was “not consulted” enough regarding changes in the run game.\n\nThat isn’t to say Stoutland was blameless. This season’s offensive line is one of the weakest he’s coached in his 13 years with the Eagles. However, a lot of that can be chalked up to injury. Johnson missed significant time, and Dickerson played through lingering injuries all year. Still, that doesn’t explain the regression from Mailata and Cam Jurgens.\n\nBut even in a down season, the Eagles’ offensive line still graded as the seventh-best in the NFL, per Pro Football Focus.\n\nMannion has instead brought in a slew of new offensive coaches. He is expected to incorporate a “west coast” type of offense, similar to that of Sean McVay or Kyle Shanahan.\n\nChris Kuper will be the new offensive line coach to replace Stoutland. Some of the other new faces include Josh Grizzard as the passing game coordinator, and Ryan Mahaffey as the Tight Ends Coach and running game coordinator.\n\nMannion has close connections to Mahaffey and Kuper already. Mahaffey coached with Mannion in Green Bay, and Kuper was a coach in Minnesota in 2023 while Mannion was still playing quarterback.\n\nThere’s been no indication of Jeff Stoutland’s next move yet. The term “leaving” indicates he may not be retiring, but he could instead try to coach elsewhere.\n\nSo what does this mean for Philadelphia’s offense? Well, big changes are still on the rise. With Dallas Goedert entering free agency and Dickerson still contemplating retirement, the Eagles’ offense could look much different than it has in recent history.\n\nFor now, however, it seems that Sean Mannion has the reins, and Sirianni is taking a step back in his offensive involvement. For better or for worse, the Mannion era is off to a polarizing start.\n\nThe post Jeff Stoutland’s Eagles Departure Signals Major Organizational Changes appeared first on The Lead.",

At 223 pounds, Brown would probably be a heavyweight.\n\nBrown has already initiated conversations with UFC CEO Dana White about potential opportunities in mixed martial arts, though he emphasized that any such move would come after his basketball career.\n\nBoston Celtics G/F Jaylen Brown says he would like to partake in the UFC or boxing post career 🤔\n\n\"Maybe post part of my career, I would love to partake in something like UFC or even boxing. I've talked to Dana White about some stuff\"#NBAAllStar26 pic.twitter.com/sBQTgICKZM\n\n— COMBAT SPORTS TODAY (@CSTodayNews) February 15, 2026\n\nBrown’s been all over the headlines this year, as his 2025-26 season has been a dominant display.\n\nThrough 49 games, Brown has averaged 29.3 points per game, ranking fourth league-wide, alongside 6.9 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.0 steals, and 0.4 blocks in 34.2 minutes. His shooting splits stand at 48.3% from the field, 34.8% from three, and 77.5% from the free-throw line.\n\nJB has been on a tear, scoring 20 or more points in 16 straight games. Earlier peaks included a 50-point explosion on January 3 and consistent double-digit rebounding outings. These career-high marks in scoring, rebounding, and assisting reflect his evolution into a more complete offensive force, helping Boston maintain a strong position heading into the All-Star break.\n\nNikola Jokic Talks Jaylen Brown’s MVP Candidacy",

    "fullText": "One of the most curious and captivating features on Saturn – an enormous spinning hexagon in the clouds at its north pole – has fascinated scientists and the public alike since our first glimpse of it in the 1980s.\n\nA trove of images and data from the Cassini probe that orbited Saturn from 2004-2017 provided some surprising answers, but not all of them, heightening the mystery even more.\n\nScientists first observed the six-sided jet stream when the two Voyager spacecraft passed by Saturn in 1980 and 1981. But their trajectories prevented the Voyagers from capturing the entire monstrous hexagon – twice as wide as Earth – in a single image from above. As they flew past, their viewing angle offered only tantalizing glimpses of its edge.\n\nMore than 20 years later, when Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004, the planet’s northern hemisphere was in winter and the hexagon was hidden in shadow. Because Saturn’s seasons last so much longer than those on Earth, scientists had to wait a few more years to see the hexagon in visible light.\n\nSo until then, they looked at it a different way.\n\nIn 2006 (still winter in Saturn’s north), Cassini’s team studied the hexagon using the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument on the spacecraft. VIMS could see the hexagon in the dark because it detects infrared wavelengths of light, basically heat generated in the warm interior of Saturn.\n\nSaturn is much farther from the Sun than Earth is, so its year – the time Saturn takes to complete one solar orbit – is about 29 Earth years. Consequently, each Saturnian season lasts more than seven Earth years.\n\nWhen Saturn approached its August 2009 equinox, spring – and sunlight – had arrived in the north and the wait was finally over. Cassini examined the hexagon with its main visible-light cameras, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). The ISS instrument had higher resolution than the VIMS instrument, and captured images in unprecedented detail.\n\nThose shots revealed a stunningly symmetric jet stream about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, with winds about 300 mph (500 kph). In addition, the hexagon spins around a tight vortex that marks Saturn’s north pole.\n\nThe hurricane-like vortex has an eye about 50 times larger than a typical Earth hurricane, and a maximum wind speed about double that of the strongest cyclones here.\n\n“This is the belly button of Saturn,” said VIMS scientist Kevin Baines, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Baines emphasized that, although it resembles a hurricane, Saturn’s north polar vortex is not the same thing because hurricanes on Earth feed on water and heat from Earth’s surface. “But it does have at least the structure of a hurricane, what we call the classic vortex.”\n\nThe hexagon itself, however, perplexed scientists. Baines called it “one of the biggest mysteries of the dynamics of Saturn.”\n\nThe hexagon has a diameter more than twice the width of Earth. Its  sides and angles are roughly symmetrical. For humans accustomed to weather on Earth, such an ordered, geometric pattern might seem curious, or even alien. Then again, maybe Earth is the oddball.\n\nOn Earth, jet streams slither and meander with no pattern or symmetry. Weather systems swirl and twirl throughout the globe. But while the atmospheres of both Saturn and Earth follow the same natural laws, different conditions produce different results.\n\nSunlight drives wind and weather patterns on Earth, and our planet is nearly 10 times closer to the Sun than Saturn is, which means we receive nearly 100 times more sunlight than Saturn. As the Earth spins, the energy it gets from the Sun varies more sharply from day to night than it does on Saturn. Earth’s surface is also non-uniform. We have water, land, ice, and snow, which heat and cool at different rates.\n\nEarth also has an extremely shallow atmosphere compared to Saturn’s, but with towering mountains reaching miles into the sky and disturbing atmospheric flow – the same way large stones in a shallow creek make the water churn and roll.\n\nIn short, Earth lacks the conditions for a jet stream to settle into a symmetric shape. But Saturn is a different story. The gas giant has no solid surface, and its composition is far more uniform.\n\nThere’s apparently nothing in Saturn’s atmosphere to keep a perfectly natural symmetric shape from forming. Scientists even duplicated the hexagon in a laboratory on Earth using a cylindrical tank of water on top of a slowly rotating table. They produced other shapes, too.\n\n“We can also get squares, octagons and other polygons – it depends on the speed and the different properties of the fluid,” Baines said.\n\nThat’s not to say scientists have Saturn’s hexagon all figured out. For some reason, Saturn has a hexagonal jet stream only in the north, not in the south. And while scientists have reproduced the hexagon in the lab, they don’t know why it’s so long-lived.\n\n“The hexagon is just a current of air, and weather features out there that share similarities to this are notoriously turbulent and unstable,” said Andrew Ingersoll, a Cassini imaging scientist from the California Institute of Technology. “A hurricane on Earth typically lasts a week, but this has been here for decades and, who knows, maybe centuries.”\n\nIn late 2012, Cassini began making swings over Saturn's poles, giving it the best views yet of the hexagon. The color-filter movie of the hexagon shown above was assembled from eight images Cassini captured over 10 hours on Dec.10, 2012.\n\n“The polar vortex at the hexagon's center – which was discovered by Cassini – is a bit of an enigma,” Baines said.\nThese highest-resolution views accentuated a wide variety of cloud structures within the hexagon. There’s the massive “hurricane” tightly centered on the north pole, and also numerous small vortices, appearing as reddish ovals. Some of those spin clockwise while the hexagon and hurricane spin counterclockwise. Some of those smaller features are swept along with the jet stream of the hexagon, as if on a racetrack. The biggest of these vortices, seen near the lower right corner of the hexagon and appearing whitish, spans about 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers), or about twice the size of the largest hurricane ever on Earth.\n\nAs Saturn’s year progressed, moving from spring toward the summer, the north pole heated up and Cassini showed the hexagon changing color. A bluish-green in 2013 turned to a yellowish haze by the planet’s summer solstice, on May 24, 2017. Solar radiation from the increasing sunlight was breaking apart methane molecules in the atmosphere, which then rearranged into hydrocarbon particles – akin to the formation of smog on Earth – and formed the yellow haze. Researchers found that small haze particles fill the inside of the hexagon, while larger particles dominate outside of it, with the inside and outside being separated by the jet stream that delineates the hexagon.\n\nAfter 20 years in space and 294 orbits around Saturn, Cassini exhausted its fuel supply. To avoid contaminating moons of Saturn that could have conditions suitable for life, Cassini’s mission team sent the probe on a daring final operation that would seal its fate. After a series of nearly two dozen nail-biting dives between the planet and the icy minefield of its rings, Cassini burned up in Saturn’s atmosphere on Sept. 15, 2017, returning science data to the very end.\n\nBefore Cassini’s Grand Finale, Baines was eager to see what further insights could come from the probe’s close-up views. “These last 22 orbits are giving us a unique chance to observe and analyze the hexagon in unprecedented detail,” he said.\n\nAnd researchers have continued poring over that data, long after Cassini’s end.\n\nGravity measurements made in Cassini's final orbits showed that the high winds at Saturn's cloud tops – up to 895 mph (1,440 kph) – persist far below, extending 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) toward the planet’s interior. Harvard researchers in 2020 used those findings to suggest that a deep supersonic jet stream is pinched on all sides by smaller cyclones and pushed upward, forming the hexagon.\n\nCassini project scientist Linda Spilker, of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said after the Grand Finale that she’s looking forward \"to seeing other new discoveries that remain to be found in the Cassini data.”\n\n“Even after Cassini’s 13 years in orbit around Saturn,” she said, “the mystery and extent of the hexagon continue to grow.”",

    "fullText": "The Phantom Corsair is a prototype automobile built in 1937.[4] It is a six-passenger 2-door sedan[1] that was designed by Rust Heinz of the H. J. Heinz family and Maurice Schwartz of the Bohman & Schwartz coachbuilding company in Pasadena, California.[5] Although sometimes dismissed as a failure because it never entered production, the Corsair is regarded as ahead of its time because of its futuristic features, and styling cues such as faired-in fenders and a low profile.[6]\n\nIt was shown to the local press in Pasadena in July 1937,[7] and first exhibited publicly at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on 15 February 1938,[8] with publicity including many construction details:\n\n“Streamlined to the ultimate—underneath as well as above—the body of the car covers wheels and eliminates necessity for fenders or running boards and thus makes possible a longer seat on which four people ride abreast. A rumble seat accommodates two passengers who face the rear…With a body of electrically welded aviation steel tubing - and an outer surface of alloy steel - and a passenger compartment lined with rubber composition, passengers ride in a scientifically safe ‘steel cage.’ Electric push buttons replace door handles, while the hood raises by an automatic trigger on the instrument panel, automatically switching on an engine service light. Seats are of solid cast rubber, eliminating seat springs. There is a ‘crash board,’ padded with cork and sponge rubber and covered with leather to minimize injury in case of accident. Layers of cork and rubber latex applied to the entire body of the car kill vibration and rumble at its source and eliminate all normal highway and engine noises. Indirect lighting features the car’s interior, while built-in headlights of enormous candlepower, with amber fog lights below, afford 180-degree highway illumination….The passenger section contains luxury compartments—one on either side of the rumble seat. There is an all-wave radio with twin speakers and an aviationtype aerial. Ceiling and sidewalls are lined with three-quarter inch light cork composition and layer of sponge rubber under upholstery of tufted design. The floor is acoustically treated with a layer of pulp composition, sprayed cork, rubber and floor carpet. Interior features are of dull finished chromium, and unprotruding. Air conditioning, which is additional, thermostatically controls cold and heat producing units.”[9]\n\nThe Phantom Corsair's steel-and-aluminum body measured just 57 in (140 cm) in height and incorporated fully skirted wheels and completely flush fenders while forgoing running boards.[10] The car also lacked door handles, as the doors were instead opened electrically using push-buttons located on the exterior and the instrument panel.[10][11] The instrument panel also featured a compass and altimeter, while a separate console above the windshield indicated when a door was ajar or if the car's lights or radio were turned on.[10] The Corsair's body was mated to the \"most advanced chassis available in the United States\" at that time, the Cord 810.[5] The Lycoming 80º V-8 engine-powered Cord chassis also featured front-wheel drive and an electrically operated four-speed pre-selector gearbox, as well as fully independent suspension and adjustable shock absorbers.[2][3][5][11][nb 1] Though these features from the Cord 810 chassis were all retained on the Phantom Corsair, the chassis was modified in order to accommodate the Corsair's large body.[5] The body measured an impressive 237 in (600 cm) long and 76.5 in (194 cm) wide, enough to accommodate four people in the front row, including one person to the left of the driver.[10][11] The back seats could only hold two passengers, however, in large part because of space limitations posed by on-board beverage cabinets.[10][11] Though weighing a hefty 4,600 lb (2,100 kg), the Phantom Corsair could achieve speeds of up to 115 mph (185 km/h) because of its modified, naturally aspirated 125 bhp Lycoming engine as well as its aerodynamic shape.[2][11]\n\nRust Heinz planned to put the Phantom Corsair, which cost approximately $24,000 to produce in 1938[11] (equivalent to about $370,000 in 2010), into limited production at an estimated selling price of $12,500.[5] However, Heinz's death in a car accident in July 1939 ended those plans, leaving the prototype Corsair as the only one ever built.[10]\n\nThe Phantom Corsair now resides in the National Automobile Museum (also known as The Harrah Collection) in Reno, Nevada.[5][10][11]",

    "description": "Because employees could do more, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees' to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.",
    "fullText": "The most seductive narrative in American work culture right now isn’t that AI will take your job. It’s that AI will save you from it.\n\nThat’s the version the industry has spent the last three years selling to millions of nervous people who are eager to buy it. Yes, some white-collar jobs will disappear. But for most other roles, the argument goes, AI is a force multiplier. You become a more capable, more indispensable lawyer, consultant, writer, coder, financial analyst — and so on. The tools work for you, you work less hard, everybody wins.\n\nBut a new study published in Harvard Business Review follows that premise to its actual conclusion, and what it finds there isn’t a productivity revolution. It finds companies are at risk of becoming burnout machines.\n\nAs part of what they describe as “in-progress research,” UC Berkeley researchers spent eight months inside a 200-person tech company watching what happened when workers genuinely embraced AI. What they found across more than 40 “in-depth” interviews was that nobody was pressured at this company. Nobody was told to hit new targets. People just started doing more because the tools made more feel doable. But because they could do these things, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees’ to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.\n\nAs one engineer told them, “You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less. But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”\n\nOver on the tech industry forum Hacker News, one commenter had the same reaction, writing, “I feel this. Since my team has jumped into an AI everything working style, expectations have tripled, stress has tripled and actual productivity has only gone up by maybe 10%. It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”\n\nIt’s fascinating and also alarming. The argument about AI and work has always stalled on the same question — are the gains real? But too few have stopped to ask what happens when they are.\n\nThe researchers’ new findings aren’t entirely novel. A separate trial last summer found experienced developers using AI tools took 19% longer on tasks while believing they were 20% faster. Around the same time, a National Bureau of Economic Research study tracking AI adoption across thousands of workplaces found that productivity gains amounted to just 3% in time savings, with no significant impact on earnings or hours worked in any occupation. Both studies have gotten picked apart.\n\nThis one may be harder to dismiss because it doesn’t challenge the premise that AI can augment what employees can do on their own. It confirms it, then shows where all that augmentation actually leads, which is “fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,” according to the researchers.\n\nThe industry bet that helping people do more would be the answer to everything, but it may turn out to be the beginning of a different problem entirely. The research is worth reading, here.",

    "fullText": "No, Disney did not release footage of a never-before-seen fight sequence between Marvel's Wolverine and Thanos (spoiler: Thanos won).\n\nThat clip, which amassed over 142,000 views on X over 48 hours, was created using Seedance 2.0, an AI video generation model that ByteDance debuted last week. The tool created a buzz on social media, where one user made a hyperrealistic AI video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting over Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nByteDance's decision to let users create content based on Disney's IP without permission isn't all that surprising given the AI industry's well-established strategy to \"ask for forgiveness, not permission.\"\n\nDisney, which is infamous for aggressively protecting its intellectual property, isn't having it — though how it responds to the threats is not always the same.\n\nOn Friday, the entertainment company sent ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns Seedance and TikTok, a cease-and-desist letter, a source familiar with the matter confirmed for Business Insider.\n\nIn the letter, Disney accused ByteDance of supplying Seedance 2.0 with \"a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art.\"\n\n\"Over Disney's well-publicized objections, ByteDance is hijacking Disney's characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters,\" the letter said.\n\nSeedance is only the latest AI company Disney says is ripping it off.\n\nDisney and NBCUniversal sued Midjourney, an AI image generator, in June last year. In the lawsuit, the companies compared Midjourney's tech to \"a virtual vending machine, generating endless unauthorized copies of Disney's and Universal's copyrighted works.\"\n\nThen Disney accused Character.AI of copyright infringement in a September cease-and-desist letter last September. In December, it sent one to Google in response to the AI image generator Nano Banana Pro and its other AI models, accusing the Big Tech giant of stealing its IP on a \"massive scale.\" Both companies have since removed Disney characters from their platforms.\n\nDisney is not anti-AI, however, and its strategy is not one-size-fits-all. The company took a much less adversarial approach with OpenAI, the world's leading AI startup.\n\nWhen OpenAI debuted Sora 2, an AI-powered text-to-video platform, in September, users began uploading IP-heavy content featuring Disney characters to social media. Instead of a cease-and-desist letter or legal action, though, Disney negotiated a deal.\n\nAlthough Disney hasn't shared plans to develop its own AI model or video generator, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company ultimately sees the tech not as a threat but as a new path to connect with audiences.\n\nDuring an earnings call late last year, he said AI would \"provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content, and to consume user-generated content, mostly short form, from others.\"",

    "description": "After helping her mom downsize, a parent explains why she's decluttering now to spare her kids the burden of managing her belongings later.",
    "fullText": "I've seen multiple articles lately about the boomer avalanche — all this stuff people have — and their kids not wanting it. I'm not a boomer, but at 46, I'm already aware that I have too much stuff.\n\nThree recent events made me think about the burden our possessions would place on our kids if something happened to us. So I started decluttering so they don't have to deal with my stuff.\n\nThe first event was helping my mom downsize.\n\nShe moved from a 2,000-square-foot townhome into a much smaller rental home. Doing a pre-move assessment, it was clear that all her stuff wouldn't fit in the new place.\n\nShe saw it as an opportunity and spent two months purging, donating, and selling items.\n\nWhen scoping out storage spots in her new home, my mom shared that she has a stack of boxes of stuff from her mom's house. She doesn't want it, but doesn't feel like she can get rid of it, and has been holding onto it since her mom passed over 10 years ago.\n\nMy kids made sure grandma didn't get rid of her little rocking chair. They both have memories of climbing on it at Grandma's house. It's now in our living room.\n\nDecorating our house for the holidays was the second event that confirmed we have too much stuff.\n\nEvery year, my husband goes into our crawl space and hauls out a full 19 boxes of holiday decor — trees, lights, ceramic villages, wrapping paper. Our house ends up covered with holidays.\n\nThis year, when decorating, I decided to downsize and packed a giant box with ornaments, tablecloths, mugs, and random decorations we haven't put up in years.\n\nDuring this process, I was reminded how important it is to check before donating. My husband noticed a few decorations from his mom in the \"donation box.\" We're keeping them. We may not display them, but there are memories in those figurines.\n\nI asked my kids what they wanted us to keep for them. Stockings, our Advent calendar, and the holiday village — each of them had items they associated with their holiday memories. These things will never go into the donation box.\n\nDuring our remodel last year — event three — my youngest and I learned how much the things we have sitting on a shelf can mean to someone else. My child's donation of stuffed animals made a huge difference to volunteers and children at a local soup kitchen.\n\nWe had a repeat experience this year, but this time with tablecloths. I have too many tablecloths. The last count was over 20. Even if I can't get laundry done for weeks, that is many more than we need. I challenged myself to get rid of half of them.\n\nA friend who volunteers at a shelter and soup kitchen happily took the donation. A few weeks later, we learned those tablecloths had a new life as blankets for a family of four who were living in their car at the time.\n\nRemodeling our house was the most eye-opening demonstration of how many things we have. Our storage space is still crammed with stuff that didn't make it back into the house after the remodel.\n\nFinding a place for everything during the renovation was a huge challenge. We quickly realized we couldn't fit 50% of our belongings (three bedrooms and my office) in the other 50% of our house.\n\nTaking up the most space — the items in my closet, which filled my entire soccer-mom-sized SUV.\n\nSo today, for every new thing I add, I donate at least two items. I've designated a section of my closet for things I haven't worn, and when the seasons change, anything in that section goes. And — the most fun — I invite friends to come \"shop\" in my closet.\n\nIn my office are multiple items that remind me of my grandma.\n\nOne of my favorite memories is being at her house, spending hours poring over her high school and college yearbooks.\n\nWhen it was clear the end was near for her, she had me take those yearbooks from the nursing home. She barely remembered who she was, but she remembered how much those books meant to me.\n\nSeeing those yearbooks evokes memories of her, keeping her alive in my mind. But they are my memories of her, not my kids'.\n\nAnd that's really the thing, isn't it? Wrapped up in all this stuff are memories and maybe a bit of guilt about getting rid of it.\n\nSo, I will keep cleaning out that closet, clearing out the storage unit, and reducing our holiday decor, but one day, my kids may have to get rid of those yearbooks.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic famously employs a Scottish philosopher named Amanda Askell.\n\nHer job is to imbue its chatbot, Claude, with a personality and a set of moral guardrails. She is essentially teaching it to be cool and good.\n\nElon Musk, however, doesn't think she's qualified.\n\n\"Those without children lack a stake in the future,\" Musk posted on X in response to a profile of Askell published by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Journal profile does not say whether Askell has kids. Musk, who has imbued his own chatbot, Grok, with a distinct personality, has 14 of them. Musk is known for promoting a brand of pronatalism that's become popular among Silicon Valley elites.\n\nAskell responded with her trademark dry intellectualism.\n\n\"I think it depends on how much you care about people in general vs. your own kin,\" Askell wrote. \"I do intend to have kids, but I still feel like I have a strong personal stake in the future because I care a lot about people thriving, even if they're not related to me.\"\n\n\"I think caring about your children can make you feel invested in the future in a new and very profound way, and I do understand people wanting to convey that,\" she added.\n\nThe responses to their short back-and-forth were as varied as you might expect on Musk's social media network. A day later, Askell posted again.\n\n\"I'm too right wing for the left and I'm too left wing for the right,\" she said. \"I'm too into humanities for those in tech and I'm too into tech for those in the humanities. What I'm learning is that failing to polarize is itself quite polarizing.\"",

    "description": "Browsing jobs in Phuket became Cheska Hull's guilty pleasure. When she called off her wedding, she decided it was time to move to Thailand.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cheska Hull, 40, a British reality TV star and PR professional who relocated to Phuket. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy move to Phuket was about choosing a fabulous place to live while continuing my freelance career.\n\nI feel like I've been part of the island's community for years. I'd visit annually for a couple of weeks at a time, maintain friendships, and get to know local business owners.\n\nEvery trip had me dreaming about potential jobs and interesting opportunities. I'm a PR specialist who has always worked in the luxury sector, across food, beverage, and hospitality. In London, I specialized in private members' clubs.\n\nThat work also led me into radio and television, where I starred in the reality show \"Made in Chelsea\" for nearly four years. It helped me understand the evolving world of influencers and celebrities. Having lived on both sides of the PR and fame spectrum, I gained a deep understanding of that industry.\n\nMy parents lived in Phuket in the 1980s, when my dad was head of Standard Chartered Bank for Phuket, which is why I was born here. We moved back to England when I was young.\n\nBeing born in Thailand didn't simplify moving back as an expat. I still had to go through all the same steps as everyone else.\n\nInitially, I came on a DTV digital nomad visa while freelancing for my UK clients. I told all of them, \"I want to live in Thailand. That's my dream.\"\n\nI wanted the best of both worlds.\n\nI've always been drawn to the famous Thai \"sabai sabai\" — take-it-easy — lifestyle. But when it comes to business, I'm driven. I could never just move to Phuket and not work.\n\nEven between projects, I was constantly networking, talking to people, and pushing for collaborations with brands I'd worked with before. Now, I get to do what I've always loved in a place I love.\n\nMy son was also at the right age for a big change. As a single mom, the stress came from knowing how significant the move was and wondering, \"Have I made the right decision?\" My main priority in life is his happiness.\n\nIf he hadn't been happy, I don't think we would have stayed. But he's 8, and he was able to fit in quickly — learning some Thai at school and thriving.\n\nThere was another catalyst, too. At the time, I was engaged to be married and realized that wasn't the path for me anymore. Once I called off the wedding, the door felt wide open.\n\nBrowsing jobs in Phuket started as a guilty pleasure. Through meeting people and networking, someone told me about a new opening at Anantara, a hotel I already knew well. It seemed perfect. And so now, as cluster director of public relations, I have a work permit.\n\nI've had to quickly learn Thai workplace customs, like addressing colleagues respectfully using \"khun\" before names or navigating the widespread use of nicknames. It's about understanding a different culture and being respectful within it.\n\nOne of my favorite rituals happens every Friday during my team's morning meeting. We go outside to a huge tree in front of the hotel with two spirit houses. We all take incense, make a prayer, and privately speak to the spirits. It's so different and unique, I find it special.\n\nIt's a meaningful part of their culture that I've come to love. I can't imagine trying to get everyone in London to do that, they'd laugh.\n\nThere haven't been many hard parts to settling in. The main challenge of living on a small, seasonal island like Phuket is traffic. You get used to a calm pace, and then suddenly there's a massive influx of people. But that comes with the territory in hospitality and tourism, which is ultimately what we want here.\n\nMy move to Thailand is long-term. Looking back, there was an element of risk. I came with a bit of an \"Eat, Pray, Love\" vision. I knew I loved it here and wanted it to work, but I also told myself, \"If it doesn't, you can just go back.\"\n\nFor me, the quality of life, the people, the food, the weather — just about everything about Phuket — makes it a place I want to call home forever. Island life simply couldn't be better right now.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad? Contact the editor at akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI just scored a win in the AI talent wars.\n\nSam Altman said Sunday on X that Peter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, the viral AI agent powering the agent-only social network Moltbook, is joining OpenAI.\n\nAltman said Steinberger would build the \"next generation\" of personal AI agents at the company.\n\n\"He is a genius with a lot of amazing ideas about the future of very smart agents interacting with each other to do very useful things for people,\" Altman said about Steinberger. \"We expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings.\"\n\nAltman added that OpenClaw, which was for a brief moment in time known as Moltbot and then Clawdbot before Anthropic took notice, will live on as an open-source project supported by OpenAI.\n\n\"The future is going to be extremely multi-agent and it's important to us to support open source as part of that,\" he wrote.\n\nSteinberger, previously best known for founding the PDF processing company PSPDFKit, came out of retirement to launch OpenClaw in late 2025.\n\nHe is likely to bring a new perspective to OpenAI's race to develop artificial general intelligence. Steinberger said he believes AGI is best as a specialized form of intelligence rather than a generalized one.\n\n\"What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?\" Steinberger said on a Y Combinator podcast in February. \"As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialize even more.\"",

    "description": "The first Air Force jet designed specifically for US presidents, SAM 26000 carried every president from John F. Kennedy to Bill Clinton.",
    "fullText": "\"If history itself had wings, it would probably be this aircraft,\" Vice President Al Gore said of the SAM 26000 Air Force One plane upon its retirement in 1998.\n\nThe first Air Force jet designed and built specifically for US presidents, SAM 26000 (pronounced two six thousand) carried eight presidents between 1962 and 1998 — every leader from John F. Kennedy to Bill Clinton.\n\nAfter 13,000 flying hours over 36 years of service, the plane was retired to the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, where it remains on display.\n\nI visited the museum in August and walked through the historic aircraft. Take a look inside.\n\nThe Boeing VC-137C was a customized and modified version of a civilian 707-320B airliner. It was powered by four Pratt & Whitney TF33 engines, each with 18,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nThe first lady also added the words \"United States of America\" to the aircraft to signal its importance as the president's plane.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president aboard the plane hours after Kennedy was pronounced dead.\n\nAdmission to the National Museum of the US Air Force is free.\n\nSAM 26000 is located in the museum's William E. Boeing Presidential Gallery, which includes other presidential planes such as the Douglas VC-54C, the first presidential aircraft, which was known as the \"Sacred Cow.\"\n\nThe crew consisted of a pilot, copilot, navigator, and flight engineer. The navigator and flight engineer roles were eventually replaced by GPS and computerized technology on later Air Force One planes.\n\nA plaque above the phones read, \"This telephone is subject to monitoring at all times. Use of this telephone constitutes consent to monitoring.\"\n\nThe closet also had a rack to hang suits and coats.\n\nThe secure communication center allowed presidents to place calls anywhere in the world while in flight.\n\nThe galley included a stovetop, oven, and sink.\n\nThe aircraft could hold up to 40 passengers.\n\nThe seating area, like many areas of the plane, is now protected by plastic barricades.\n\nStationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, the 89th Airlift Wing is tasked with flying the president and high-ranking government officials. The group is also referred to as \"SAM FOX,\" which stands for \"Special Air Missions Foreign.\"\n\nThe benches in the hallway were hollow to offer additional storage.\n\nIn 1969, Nixon redesigned Air Force One and moved the presidential quarters over the wings, which was the quietest and smoothest part of the plane during flight.\n\nPresidents used the white phone to communicate with crew members and other passengers on the plane, while the beige phone could be used to call anywhere in the world.\n\nThe room was furnished with throne chairs, a folding table, and another TV.\n\nPresidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter sat here while flying to attend Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat's funeral in 1981.\n\nPresidents used the electric typewriter to write and edit speeches while on board the plane.\n\nThe wall of the office space was decorated with a map of the United States.\n\nKennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, while visiting Dallas. He was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital at 1 p.m., and Johnson took the oath of office at 2:38 p.m.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's pink suit was still smeared with blood when Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes administered the oath of office on Air Force One. Johnson's wife, Lady Bird Johnson, stood to his right.\n\nEven blocked off by plastic barricades, the plane's cabin preserves a pivotal moment in US history.\n\nThe Secret Service had to break the handles off the casket to make it fit through the plane door.\n\nThe seating area featured six seats, a phone, and a folding table.\n\nAccording to US Flag Code, an American flag decal must always be positioned so that the stars face forward.\n\nLike many modes of presidential transportation, such as the bulletproof limousine known as \"The Beast\" and the Marine One helicopter, Air Force One is about more than simply getting the president from point A to point B. It symbolizes the power of the United States and its elected leader wherever it goes.\n\nThe image projected by presidential planes remains of great interest to President Donald Trump, who opted to accept a luxurious Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family instead of waiting for Boeing to deliver its long-delayed new Air Force One jets.",

    "description": "Elisa Orsi and David Sleight moved to China with their kids and were surprised to see how clean, modern, and convenient everything was.",
    "fullText": "After five years in Qatar, Elisa Orsi and her husband, David Sleight, knew they were ready to leave the desert behind.\n\nThey had moved from Australia to the Middle Eastern country in 2019 with their three kids — all under 6 — after Sleight accepted a job there.\n\nAlready big travelers before they had kids, the couple used school holidays to see the world after starting a family, before later leveraging Sleight's teaching career to travel even more.\n\n\"Usually when people have children, it deters them from travel, but we went completely the other way,\" Orsi, 37, a stay-at-home mom, told Business Insider.\n\nLife in Qatar felt safe and comfortable, and it served as a base from which they could explore the region, traveling to places like Jordan, Turkey, and Egypt.\n\nGradually, the couple found themselves looking for something new.\n\n\"By the time we came back from our summer holiday in 2024, we said, 'OK, we're done. We need a change,'\" Orsi said.\n\nIn August 2024, the family packed up their bags and moved to Hangzhou, a bustling city in eastern China.\n\nChina had been on their radar for a long time, though neither of them had visited before.\n\nIt wasn't until Sleight came across an online job ad for a teaching role in Hangzhou that they began looking into the city.\n\n\"I was impressed with the natural beauty and how modern the city appeared. I knew China was very well connected by the railway infrastructure, so I wasn't overly concerned about the location,\" Sleight, 45, told Business Insider.\n\nThe couple looped their kids, who are now 11, 9, and 7, into the conversation about moving to China early. \"We wanted to give them lots of time to process and to get an understanding of what was happening,\" she said.\n\n\"We have a philosophy that we talk to our children, and we keep them informed about the decisions we make,\" Orsi said.\n\nTo ease the transition, they showed their kids YouTube videos about China and the school they would attend.\n\nWhen they arrived in Hangzhou, Orsi said their first impressions quickly put any lingering nerves at ease.\n\n\"We were actually quite shocked to see how clean, how modern, how organized, and how convenient everything is,\" Orsi said. \"Sometimes you watch videos, but unless you're actually in it, you can't really understand it to that degree until it affects your life.\"\n\nTheir children attend an international school, and Sleight teaches English in the school's bilingual program.\n\nHouse-hunting was a breeze because the school put them in contact with a real-estate agent ahead of their move.\n\n\"We wanted to have a bedroom for each of the kids, and we were looking for amenities,\" she said. \"Most importantly, we wanted to be close to the school.\"\n\nWithin 10 days of arriving in China, the family moved into a four-bedroom apartment. It's about a five-minute drive from the school and roughly 50 minutes outside the city center, in a neighborhood dominated by local Chinese families.\n\nRent is 5,500 Chinese yuan, or about $790 a month, and is covered by the school as part of Sleight's employment contract.\n\nEven with a growing foreign community, the transition isn't always easy.\n\n\"During staff meetings and presentations, I wear an earpiece and listen to a live translation provided by the school's professional translator,\" he said. Sleight added that parents and staff also communicate through a messaging app with built-in translation.\n\n\"If anything were to go wrong, the issue would be resolved very, very quickly. So the children, they can be outside on their own,\" Orsi said. She added that she probably wouldn't feel comfortable giving her kids the same level of freedom even in Townsville, a city in North Queensland, where they lived before moving to Qatar.\n\nIt's also common to see children wearing kid-friendly smartwatches, which let them be more independent.\n\n\"You can see their location, they can call you, they can pay for things, and so they can go anywhere. They'll organize their own play dates and go and meet their friends,\" she said.\n\nAs a woman, Orsi also feels safe walking alone, including from the train station late at night. \"I have not thought about it twice. I wouldn't do it in Australia. And I wouldn't do it in Argentina, where I'm from,\" she said. Orsi moved to Australia in her teens and later met Sleight while working at a telecommunications company.\n\nIt took a year, but Orsi says the family finally feels settled in their new home. Most of their social circle has grown out of the school community, including other parents and foreign teachers.\n\nThe longer school days have also given Orsi more time for herself. She said she's picked up new hobbies, including learning to play the piano, going to the gym, and focusing on content creation for their YouTube channel, where she and Sleight document their family life in China.\n\nSleight is on a three-year contract at the school. As for what comes next, Orsi said the family hasn't made any firm decisions.\n\n\"I think we would probably like to move elsewhere and go to another country when our contract is up, but that could change,\" she said. \"We may very well decide to stay in China and move to another school or experience a different city.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city?

Malachy O'Rourke's side impressed in a 2-23 to 1-14 win over Cavan, who are joint bottom of the table with Offaly.\n\nIn Division Three, Fermanagh are adrift at the bottom as their 2-18 to 0-18 defeat by Clare at Brewster Park leaves Declan Bonner's side without anything to show after three games.\n\nIt's the same story for Antrim in Division Four as Mark Doran's side are without anything to show from their three games with Longford powering to a 1-27 to 1-14 win in Portglenone.\n\nIt took nine minutes for the first score of the game to arrive in Letterkenny.\n\nAfter a cagey start, two efforts apiece from Conor McCahill and Oisin Gallen saw Donegal race into an early lead.\n\nRyan O'Donoghue finally got Mayo off the mark on 16 minutes with a two-point free, but it would take 27 minutes for the Connacht men to register a score from play.\n\nGallen landed five points of his own throughout the half as Donegal went in leading 0-11 to 0-5 at the break.\n\nMayo had chances to reduce the arrears early in the second half but Darragh Beirne, Conor Loftus and Ryan O'Donoghue all had goal chances well saved by Gavin Mulreaney.\n\nRyan McHugh floated over a superb two pointer to re-establish Donegal's six-point advantage before Paedar Mogan set up Conor O'Donnell to punch to the back of the net.\n\nMcCahill and Finbarr Roarty added scores to give Donegal a 1-16 to 0-8 lead midway through the second half.\n\nAndy Moran's side replied with three scores in a row before Beirne was once again denied a sure goal as Mulreaney made a brave save from close range.\n\nLate scores from McCahill and O'Donnell sealed a comfortable win for Jim McGuinness' side ahead of their trip to take on Armagh next weekend.\n\nA disallowed goal in the second half from Armagh's Ross McQuillan ultimately proved fatal, but Roscommon's platform for victory was built in the first half.\n\nA two-pointer from Diarmuid Murtagh in the opening minute set the tone as after Oisin O'Neill opened Armagh's account at the other end, the Roscommon captain was put through for a third-minute goal.\n\nIt would get better for the hosts as Blaine Hughes' subsequent kick-out went awry and Enda Smith was put in to thump home.\n\nThe sides traded a pair of scores before Murtagh kicked another two-pointer, while the crossbar denied Dylan Ruane a third goal for the hosts.\n\nStill, they pushed further clear with a Daire Cregg free and a third Murtagh two-pointer - this time from a free - before Armagh briefly rallied with points from Cian McConville and Ross McQuillan.\n\nHowever, a two-pointer from Cregg and a further two scores extended the gap to 14 before Armagh enjoyed a decent spell with three points, but a Cregg free on the stroke of half-time left Roscommon with a commanding 2-14 to 0-8 advantage.\n\nSmith extended the gap straight after the break, but Armagh roared back with the next six points, including back-to-back two-pointers from Oisin O'Neill.\n\nThe Orchardmen thought they were right back in it in the 47th minute when McQuillan crashed home, but the goal was ruled out as his side had left less than four players in their own half and instead of a four-point gap, it was eight with Murtagh tapping over a free in front of the posts.\n\nThis four-point swing was ultimately crucial but so too was Roscommon's third goal in the 61st minute.\n\nWith just six between them, substitutes combined as Jack Duggan sent a ball inside for Paul Carey to palm home, but Armagh were not done and two-pointers from O'Neill and McConville either side of a Tomas McCormack point brought them to within four.\n\nThey had a big goal chance with minutes to play when Jason Duffy fed inside to McConville, but he could only divert into the arms of Aaron Brady.\n\nArmagh kept pressing, but a Greg McCabe shot whistled over at the death as they slipped to defeat with Roscommon making it back-to-back wins over Ulster opposition.\n\nDarragh Canavan struck nine points a man of the match display as Tyrone secured their first win of the campaign with a commanding victory over Cavan.\n\nThe Red Hands recovered from a shaky start to take over in the second period and with 12 different scorers, they will be happy with their day's work against Dermot McCabe's men, who are still without a point on the board.\n\nCavan enjoyed a good start as, after Eoin McElholm kicked the first of his four points for Tyrone, Oisin Brady nailed a two-point free for the Breffni men, who then had a goal as Tiernan Madden finished from close range.\n\nHowever, Tyrone responded well with the nest three scores and although Peter Corrigan and Gerard Smith hit back, the game was level in the 17th minute as Brian Kennedy took a pass from Seanie O'Donnell and lashed home.\n\nIt remained even heading to the break but Tyrone finished strong with Kennedy turning provider for Mattie Donnelly to hit Tyrone's second goal and a Canavan point straight after opened a 2-8 to 1-7 lead at the break.\n\nCavan introduced Paddy Lynch at the break and he carried most of the fight in the second period with five points, but his side could not gain any real momentum as Tyrone began to pull away.\n\nA two-pointer from Canavan seemed to kick the Red Hands' surge with Cavan goalkeeper Liam Brady called into action on a couple of occasions, tipping a McElholm shot over and then saving from O'Donnell with Ben Cullen fisting over the rebound.\n\nThe scores continued to flow for the hosts, who outscored their Ulster rivals by 11 points to three in the final quarter as they breathed life into their campaign with Cavan, who lost Brady to a black card in the dying moments, now in a relegation battle.\n\nGoals from Aaron Griffin and Daniel Walsh were the difference in Clare's victory in Enniskillen as Fermanagh prop up Division Three.\n\nIt was an even start to the game with a Ciaran O'Hanlon two-pointer helping Fermangh into a narrow lead before they were hit for the first of the Clare goals as they coughed up possession and Eoin Cleary found Griffin to fire home after 12 minutes.\n\nA two-point free from Garvan Jones following a point by Clare's Mark McInerney, as Fermanagh pushed on with a two-pointer by Darragh McGurn helping them into the lead, but Cleary found a two-pointer of his own as Clare led 1-10 to 0-10 at the break.\n\nFermanagh made a flying start to the second period with the first five scores, but Clare rallied and led by three with McInerney and Cleary to the fore.\n\nThe hosts brought it back to one through Ronan McCaffrey and Josh Largo Ellis, but they failed to recover from Walsh's goal in the 60th minute as Clare secured their first win to leave Fermanagh in trouble at the bottom.\n\nIt was another day to forget for Antrim, who were soundly beaten by Longford in Portglenone.\n\nThe Saffrons opened well with Adam Loughran on target, but the visitors took command with Oran Kenny and Matthew Carey proving a thorn in the side of Mark Doran's men.\n\nLongford were six to the good when Loughran found the net for Antrim in the 21st minute, but it failed to ignite their challenge as the long-range ability of Kenny, Carey and Dessie Reynolds helped the Leinster side into a 0-19 to 1-4 lead at the break.\n\nAntrim did make a fight of it in the second half with Loughran, Niall Burns, Ryan McQuillan, Dominic McEnhill and Ryan Murray on target, but they were unable to assert real pressure on their visitors with Reynolds and Joseph Hagan keeping the board ticking before the issue was put beyond doubt with Carey striking home a 61st-minute penalty.\n\nLate two-pointers from Antrim's Pat Shivers served to add some respectability to the board, but the Saffrons find themselves bottom of Division Four on score difference from Waterford.",

    "description": "Gerard Deulofeu has not played for more than three years but believes he can make \"history\" by fighting for a \"miracle\" comeback.",
    "fullText": "The years have ticked by, three of them since he last kicked a ball, but every day spent grafting in the gym is one Gerard Deulofeu believes he is a step closer to a \"miracle\".\n\n\"One of the things I get energy from is that I know I can make history,\" says the 31-year-old, whose last appearance for Udinese was in January 2023.\n\nFootball is his passion, his job. It is the game that took him to Barcelona's famed La Masia academy as a child and European glory as an adult. To the FA Cup final and the unbridled pride of scoring for his country. Tying full-backs in knots from Milan to Merseyside.\n\nDeulofeu desperately wants to feel that rush again, to complete what he feels would be the longest recovery ever.\n\nBut there was a time, the hardest time in those more than 1,100 days since his injury, where he could not walk with his kids, take the dogs out, drive the car.\n\nWhat Deulofeu really missed then were the simple things.\n\n\"I lost all my personal life,\" he says. \"That's the most hurtful thing that you can feel.\n\n\"Now I am just waiting to do a miracle to be back playing football. But I know it is so difficult to come back with that type of incapacity.\"\n\nDeulofeu squeezes each hand into a fist and crunches his knuckles together to replicate his right knee. \"My two bones,\" he grimaces. \"They are shocking.\"\n\nThe former Spain winger had already spent two months recovering from what he did not realise was an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury sustained before Serie A broke up for the World Cup, when his short-lived return happened.\n\nAfter coming off the bench against Sampdoria some 37 months ago, he could feel the knee giving way and asked to be taken off.\n\n\"I played 15 minutes,\" says Deulofeu. \"And there, in that 15 minutes, the ACL was completely broken. That was my last game.\"\n\nHad it just been a case of fixing his ACL - and Deulofeu stresses that is a \"crazy\" injury in itself, but one from which most modern footballers recover - he would have been back representing I Bianconeri more than two years ago.\n\nIndeed, the winger successfully returned eight months after a previous ACL tear at Watford in 2020.\n\n\"You do the surgery and you change your ACL, your system, and you do a progressive recovery,\" he says. \"But the problem was the infection.\"\n\nThat infection ate away at the cartilage in his knee, each scan showing it progressively deteriorating, reducing Deulofeu to the feeling of bone on bone.\n\n\"I wasn't the luckiest person,\" he shrugs.\n\nHe has consulted fellow Spaniard Santi Cazorla, who was sidelined for 636 days after gangrene ravaged his Achilles tendon, and takes inspiration from the former Arsenal midfielder's comeback.\n\n\"It is an amazing example,\" says Deulofeu. \"To imagine how he suffered in these two years and a half, I can feel it now.\"\n\nDeulofeu's first step was to have cell treatment in an attempt to rebuild the cartilage, but he faced a setback after attempting to run again.\n\n\"My knee needed to heal,\" he explains. \"To train hard, first you have to heal.\"\n\nAlmost two years later, having continued with injections for his cell treatment, he believes he is close to trying to run once more.\n\nIt is a product of what Deulofeu says was six months of building \"muscle, muscle, muscle\" in the gym, working with a physio and fitness trainer for three to four hours every morning, five days a week at Udinese's Stadio Friuli.\n\n\"Let's see if I can accept impact,\" he says. \"I am so happy because I feel the leg is really strong. The more muscle you get, the less pain you have inside the knee, so now I feel that, yes, my knee is prepared to run.\n\n\"I am feeling that I am close. If we speak about muscle, I am in the same levels of the available guys now.\n\n\"But let's see how they respond, with no cartilage and no meniscus...\"\n\nDeulofeu admits there were times he felt like quitting, but he remains remarkably upbeat and focused on his goal of returning to professional football.\n\n\"There are three really important things,\" he explains. \"One, for sure, is family and home. To try to go ahead with this period, first of all your home has to be with peace and love every morning.\n\n\"Happiness, seeing your kids growing, with your wife, really good peace and love at home. That's really important to go to training every day with a good mood.\"\n\nOne positive Deulofeu takes from this period is that he can enjoy more time with his family than is afforded to most professional footballers.\n\n\"In those three years I am out of my work, my passion, I can see how good it is just being at home,\" he says.\n\n\"Just being with your family, with your kids, looking at them growing and being a father, because with football you lose a lot of good periods, good moments.\n\n\"There are a lot of games now in modern football, every three or four days you play, and your kids are growing so fast.\"\n\nHis three children, though, are also the main fuel for Deulofeu to want to play football again - he wants them to be able to share those memories with them.\n\n\"My big daughter is eight years old and she is playing football, and my son is five and also playing football,\" he explains. \"Now they are telling me: 'When are you going to get back? I want to go with you to the stadium!'\n\n\"That type of history with the kids, that gives me the power to continue and to fight for being there with them, enjoy that moment with them now they are older.\"\n\nThe second reason Deulofeu gives is his relationship with the club and the Pozzo family, who brought him to Watford and then Udinese.\n\nBoth parties agreed to end his contract when it became clear Deulofeu would be sidelined indefinitely, but Udinese have provided him with the facilities to continue his recovery.\n\nIn return, he is passionate about wanting to represent them again.\n\nFinally, he is a self-confessed fitness obsessive. Deulofeu can be seen studying the science behind his recovery while recuperating in oxygen machines or during rest periods.\n\n\"I am really interested in everything about health,\" he says. \"So I'm enjoying being healthy, you know?\n\n\"Being positive helps me to see life in other ways. I cannot think 'oh, it happens to me, I'm so unlucky'. OK, maybe yes, but I prefer to think in another way, my mind being clear and clean to go and suffer every morning - if not, you are completely out.\"\n\nHe spends his time at the club \"with a smile, with my team-mates, giving them advice\". He adds: \"Just enjoying my recovery, seeing my improvements, I can feel more positive.\"\n\nHe is grateful too this layoff has come towards the back end of his career. With 350 club games spanning the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, as well as four Spain caps, he has fulfilled a goal of which most only dream.\n\n\"Imagine if that type of injury happens when you are young? You are completely gone, your career,\" he says.\n\n\"So I am grateful to play this career with AC Milan, Barcelona, Everton, Sevilla... I won the Europa League, I play for my national team, I score. What can you demand more?\n\n\"Let's see now if I can continue my career or just be grateful to be part of 10, 12 years in that amazing sport.\"\n\nAfter the interview wraps up, Deulofeu has another hour and a half on the bike to complete, before switching back into father mode - the kids need picking up from school and his son has training in the evening.\n\nHe gets too nervous to watch Udinese in the stadiums at weekends, plus he must rest for another hard week of training, but loves witnessing his children playing football.\n\n\"Seriously, I am there for two hours because I am so proud,\" he beams. \"My kids' game is my game!\n\n\"Sometimes the coaches tell me 'come here to the pitch and lend them some advice'. It's funny, it's good. How to put the foot, how to pass. It is beautiful.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can \nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nI am getting some friendly heat from all of you about a video I posted on X.com Friday before 6 a.m.\n\nWhat are Wall Street strategists saying about contagion risks?\n\nHow is market contagion spreading beyond software stocks?\n\nWhat is causing the software stock crash?\n\nHow might AI infrastructure spending affect markets?\n\nIt was actually live — I began rolling from inside Yahoo Finance HQ around 5:30 a.m. with a full stream of consciousness on the software stock crash. If you are up before 6 a.m. studying stocks and reading news, I promise to be doing more live moments like this in the weeks ahead.\n\nNow, some of you appear not to have liked that I called this a \"crash\" in software stocks. How else could you characterize it, I mean, really? I'm not being alarmist!\n\nWorkday (WDAY) is down 30% in a month despite zero indications that the company will go out of business in 2027 because of an Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) model update.\n\nSend me a different word to use, and I'll use it. And don't tell me it's a \"pullback.\"\n\nMeanwhile, others were hoping I would hop to the mic and offer up a shopping list of software stocks to buy. I am not going to do that because: 1) I no longer pick stocks, and 2) I don't believe the bottom in software stocks is in.\n\nAnd this brings me to my guiding light for today's Morning Brief: contagion.\n\nThe reason I'm worried about this new phase of the software stock crash is that it looks to be spreading to other areas of the market. We witnessed that during Thursday's brutal session for stocks.\n\nAnd Wall Street is beginning to take notice.\n\n\"Regardless of arguable ubiquity of AI application legitimately widening shakedown, the wider selloff in commodities/gold have hallmarks of cross-liquidation involving financial contagion risks,\" Mizuho strategist Vishnu Varathan said. \"Nonetheless, there are increasingly legitimate worries — involving with 'contagion' and froth in bull markets — associated with this 'correlation creep', whereby AI-driven sell-off cascade more indiscriminately.\"\n\nVarathan makes a great point, and it could be where market sentiment heads next. Think of the next dark cloud emerging in the sky coming to sit on top of your house. As this dark cloud rolls in, markets will adjust further.\n\nTo be sure, only time will tell if the massive software stock sell-offs are overdone. But this much we can say: It's an exciting time to be in tech as billions get spent to build out America's AI infrastructure. You just have to respect this hardcore trend and remember it won't be great news for every publicly traded company.",

    "description": "Interim manager Martin O'Neill says the current side's fighting spirit reminds him of his previous Celtic glory years after their comeback win in Kilmarnock.",
    "fullText": "When your manager is a club legend and he starts comparing you to the side that made him such, you know you must be doing something right.\n\nIt might just be a clever bit of psychology to do so, but if it helps Martin O'Neill lead Celtic to another Scottish title, he will have worked his magic again.\n\nWhatever words he used at half-time at Rugby Park, they were certainly clever considering the reigning champions came from two goals down to secure a 3-2 victory deep into stoppage time.\n\nWatch: Kilmarnock v Celtic - Sportscene highlights\n\nIt was the third time in a week that Celtic had rescued victory from the jaws of a damaging result.\n\nLast weekend, they looked to be exiting the Scottish Cup before Junior Adamu equalised in the 90th minute and Sebastian Tounekti scored the winner in extra time to secure a quarter-final place.\n\nOn Wednesday, they were seconds away from dropping a league point at home to bottom side Livingston, only for latest signing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to produce a dream debut winner, again in the 90th minute.\n\nThis time, Kilmarnock looked destined for what would have been a deserved point until Julian Araujo smashed their resistance with a stunning strike seven minutes into overtime.\n\nFor some, it would have been a reminder of the \"relentless\" nature of Ange Postecoglu's title-winning Celtic side.\n\nFor O'Neill, it brought back memories of his own glory days. Of the famous names like Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton and John Hartson who contributed to three league titles, three Scottish Cups, a League Cup and a journey to the Uefa Cup final.\n\n\"I managed, coached, a really top-quality side here 20-odd years ago who had loads of spirit, loads of resilience, loads of ability,\" the 73-year-old Northern Irishman told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"And these lads here are emulating that in many aspects and sometimes surpassing.\"\n\nLate goals are certainly becoming a bit of a habit for his current charges since he returned for a second spell as interim manager following the dismal short spell under Wilfried Nancy.\n\nCeltic have now scored six winning goals in the 90th minute or later in the Premiership this season, the most by any team in a single campaign since it was rebranded in 2013, surpassing the previous best by Rangers in 2016-17.\n\nIndeed, until Araujo's winner in Ayrshire, the Old Firm sides were sitting on eight goals apiece in the 90th minute or later in the Premiership this season.\n\nThe two Glasgow sides have had their problems this season, both sacking managers, with Heart of Midlothian having taken advantage to lead the table since September.\n\nChermiti hat-trick earns Rangers seismic win over leaders Hearts\n\nCeltic score 97th-minute winner to down Kilmarnock\n\nFormidable Motherwell carve out victory over Aberdeen\n\nHowever, it is the kind of spirit that has been gradually pegging back Derek McInnes' pacesetters as the traditional giants of Scottish football start to get their act together.\n\n\"The spirit the players has been absolutely fantastic,\" McNeill said.\n\n\"It was a wonderful second-half performance for us. Kilmarnock adapted to the conditions, the rain, the pitch, much better than we did and sometimes you just have to dig in - and that's exactly what we did.\"\n\nCeltic's board has been under pressure this season for their recruitment, both on the field and off it, but their latest moves appear to be bearing fruit.\n\nAdamu, the striker who arrived on loan from Freiburg last month, saved their blushes against Dundee and Tounekti, the summer arrival from Hammarby, secured cup progress before his opener inspired the comeback against Kilmarnock.\n\nRight-back match winner Araujo was another January arrival on loan from Bournemouth, while former England midfielder Oxlade-Chamberlain grabbed the midweek winner days after being plucked from half a season without a club.\n\nOf course, O'Neill's introduction of Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tounekti and another January arrival, Czech Republic striker Tomas Cvancara, at half-time also proved to be a managerial masterstroke.\n\nDespite the plaudits, O'Neill recognises that flaws remain.\n\n\"I thought we were very poor in the first half,\" he said. \"As a team defending, we weren't that good then we keep giving the ball away at times, but the second half was totally different.\n\n\"We made the changes at half time and then Seb scores a wonder goal for us and puts us right back in the game, culminating in us winning the match.\n\n\"But you can't keep doing that. We've got to put in the full 90 minutes.\"\n\nThe win at Rugby Park had former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner harking back to yet another era.\n\n\"They know now that this game is not 90 minutes - it's now now 96-97 minutes and they will keep going to the final whistle,\" he said.\n\n\"And that's the making of a championship-winning team. We did it in '87-88 and we won games when we were almost out of it and that's what it takes.\n\n\"You keep going. You might not play brilliantly in all of the games.\"\n\nFormer Kilmarnock goalkeeper Cammy Bell suggested \"small margins are going Celtic's way\" right now.\n\n\"They do not stop and you see the reaction of the players, the fans and the togetherness and the players will be in there on top of the world because that is a huge result for Celtic.\"\n\nWith Rangers producing a comeback of their own to beat Hearts 4-2 in the later kick-off at Ibrox, only three points separate the top three title contenders, with third-top Celtic having a game in hand.\n\nHow many more stoppage-time winners will be crucial to the destiny of the silverware?\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Aston Villa manager Natalia Arroyo was disappointed by side's 7-3 defeat by Tottenham while opposite number Martin Ho wanted more goals.",
    "fullText": "If anything, Tottenham boss Martin Ho was a little disappointed by his side's 7-3 success at Aston Villa.\n\nHaving just watched his side comprehensively take apart the hosts for their second biggest Women's Super League win, he said: \"We probably could have had another five or six more.\"\n\nHo might well have been thinking they should have beaten their 8-0 record victory over Brighton back in October 2022.\n\nSpurs had 27 shots, 12 of them on target, in dismantling struggling Villa, who have now tasted defeat in four straight league games.\n\nVilla boss Natalia Arroyo admitted: \"They were ruthless and clinical in every action and didn't allow us to breathe for one second.\n\n\"It was like being thrown in a swimming pool and not allowed to get air - it was cruel. I am really sorry and disappointed.\"\n\nThe goal rush was started by Signe Gaupset's first Spurs goal on 10 minutes. Villa equalised but were only level for three minutes as Spurs grabbed two \n\nOriane Jean-Francois pulled another goal back for Villa in the 68th minute but just like in the first half, Tottenham responded quickly - just 12 seconds later - and three more followed to complete the rout.\n\n68 minutes 2-3: Oriane Jean-Francois scores for Villa.\n\n69 minutes 2-4: Cathinka Tandberg restores Tottenham's two-goal cushion.\n\n72 minutes 2-5: Maika Hamano stretches lead.\n\n80 minutes 3-5: Kirsty Hanson trims the deficit with her second of the afternoon.\n\n82 minutes 3-6: Substitute Tandberg scores her second goal with her third touch of the game.\n\n85 minutes 3-7: Julie Blakstad rounds off the 10-goal thriller at Villa Park.\n\nSpurs thrash Villa in 10-goal WSL thriller\n\nBefore becoming Tottenham manager in July last year, Ho was in charge of Norwegian side SK Brann.\n\nIn his first nine games, he got seven wins to help Brann finish fourth in the table.\n\nHe also created history in the Champions League, leading them to victory in all four of their qualifying matches to become the first Norwegian side to reach the group stage.\n\nHis Scandinavian connections are now bearing fruit at Spurs, with five from that region playing a part at Villa Park.\n\n\"We've been speaking about having more of a ruthless edge with the ball in front of goal because we are creating chances,\" said Ho afterwards.\n\n\"We had 27 shots - that's a lot. We probably could have had another five or six [goals] with the chances we created but when you score that many goals, it shows the belief in the team and the confidence through the group.\"\n\nNorway duo Blakstad and Gaupset each scored and provided an assist, while compatriot Tandberg came off the bench to score twice. Denmark winger Olivia Holdt also scored one and made one.\n\nThe 20-year-old Gaupset only joined Tottenham in January from Brann, while Blakstad, 24, signed from Hammarby four days later.\n\nAs for Tandberg, 21, and the 24-year-old Holdt, they came last summer and have also been instrumental in the side's efforts this season.\n\nTandberg is their top scorer in the league with six goals, and has two assists, and Holdt just one behind, but has provided three assists.\n\nThe exciting forward options has given fifth-placed Spurs hope of pushing for a Champions League place as they joined Arsenal on 29 points - five adrift of second-placed Manchester United, with Chelsea in third.\n\nEven if they miss out, there has been radical improvement under Ho.\n\nHaving finished second from bottom with 20 points last season, they are nine better off this time around with six games still left to play.\n\nAt the end of the 2022-23 season, Villa finished fifth on 37 points and there was talk of them going on to break into the top three.\n\nSince then, they have at least stabilised in mid-table, finishing seventh with 24 points and then sixth with 25 last term.\n\nCurrently however, Arroyo's side are ninth with 16 points from their 16 games - just seven above bottom club Leicester City, while fellow strugglers Liverpool and West Ham show signs of revival in the fight to stay up.\n\nVilla do have the league's second top scorer in Kirsty Hanson, whose nine goals are six fewer than Manchester City's Khadija Shaw.\n\nAt the back, however, things are starting to unravel, with 25 goals conceded in the past six league matches.\n\nThey have also shipped 12 in the final 15 minutes of the second half, more than any other team in the league this season.\n\nArroyo said: \"We don't want to lose a game, we don't want to concede seven goals and we need to do better.\n\n\"We will have a few weeks to work together and hopefully get fresh legs, more options and a deeper bench. I am proud of scoring three goals and will take some of the positives but we can't let teams score almost all of chances they have. See if we can close our house.\"\n\nVilla, who face leaders Manchester City next, need to arrest their slide to avoid getting sucked into the relegation battle.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "Former President Barack Obama spilled what he learned about extraterrestrial life when he was in the White House, saying aliens are \"real.\"",
    "fullText": "In his wide-ranging interview with progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen on Saturday, former President Barack Obama spilled what he learned about extraterrestrial life when he was in the White House.\n\n“I want to do a little bit of a lightning round, because it’s not often I’ll get access to a president of the United States,” Cohen said.\n\n“Come on, man,” Obama encouraged him.\n\n“So, couple questions here: Are aliens real?”\n\n“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in Area 51,” Obama said.\n\n“There’s no underground facility,” he continued, adding, “unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States.”\n\nCohen then asked, “What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president?”\n\n“Where are the aliens?” Obama said with a chuckle.\n\nObama didn’t let on exactly how he knew aliens were real, or whether it was just his own personal belief.\n\nThe subject of space aliens has gained traction in the years since Obama was president. Several congressional hearings have been held between 2022 and 2025 focusing on “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena“.\n\nIn 2023 NPR reported that during his testimony, Retired Maj. David Grusch — who went from being part of the Pentagon’s UAP Task Force to becoming a government whistleblower — told the House Oversight Committee’s national security subcommittee “that he had been denied access to some government UFO programs but that he knows the ‘exact locations’ of UAPs in U.S. possession.”\n\n“Grusch also alleged that the U.S. has retrieved ‘non-human’ biological matter from the pilots of the crafts,” the report said.\n\nAnd just last summer, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) told Joe Rogan that she has seen evidence of “interdimensional beings.”\n\nLuna serves as the head of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, a subcommittee under the House Oversight Committee. She told Rogan, “Based on the photos that I’ve seen, I’m very confident that there’s things out there that have not been created by mankind.”\n\nWatch the interview above with former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe post ‘They’re Real!’ Barack Obama Spills What He Learned About Aliens When He Was President first appeared on Mediaite.",

You have to make good decisions under pressure.\"\n\nEngland head coach Steve Borthwick is already without injured wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso but has options for Saturday's match against Ireland should Arundell be banned.\n\nBorthwick could promote Elliot Daly or Cadan Murley into his starting XV at Allianz Stadium.\n\nAlternatively, he could move Tommy Freeman back to the wing and recall Ollie Lawrence at outside centre.\n\nEngland's humbling defeat at Murrayfield - which snapped a 12-match winning streak - was a blow to their hopes of a first Six Nations title since 2020.

    "fullText": "Wales played in front of their smallest Six Nations crowd in Cardiff as the crisis in the domestic game continues to turn off fans.\n\nJust 57,744 turned out to watch the latest record defeat, this time a 54-12 hammering by France at the Principality Stadium.\n\nIt meant there were more than 15,000 empty seats for what is traditionally one of the biggest events in the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) calendar.\n\nBut the uncertainty within the game in Wales appears to be taking a toll on the public appetite.\n\nWales head coach Steve Tandy said: \"We understand it's our job as a team to get the support here but the public have been amazingly supportive and understand where we are.\"\n\nIt was lower than the previous worst attendance of 58,349 against Italy in 2002 when Wales were in another losing streak.\n\nThe cost of a match-day experience in Cardiff has been suggested as the reason for some fans staying away.\n\nBut the political turmoil in the domestic game, with the WRU looking to cut one region while facing a potential vote of no confidence among member clubs, is leaving disgruntled fans to turn away.\n\nBefore Sunday's game, fans told BBC Sport the current crisis was \"heartbreaking, sad and depressing\" and many were no longer motivated to buy tickets.\n\nSwansea council leader Rob Stewart, who has previously spoken out against the Welsh Rugby Union's plans to potentially cut Ospreys, said fans were voting with their feet.\n\nHe said on social media: \"It's heart-breaking to see the Principality Stadium barely 3/4 full today. Much as we love our Wales team, fans are voting with their feet and staying away.\n\n\"Their message to the WRU is clear - we will stay away until you go away.\"\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nWales still rugby nation despite struggles - Tandy\n\nTens of thousands of Six Nations tickets still unsold amid Welsh rugby turmoil\n\nFans and clubs have openly criticised the WRU hierarchy, with board member John Manders saying some of the social media comments aimed at the governing body's bosses has \"crossed a line\".\n\nWales are also on a desperately poor run of form having lost 23 or their last 25 Test matches.\n\nFormer Wales international James Hook told the Scrum V podcast: \"Fans want to see a competitive game with a chance of Wales winning but at the moment we're got getting that. No-one is coming expecting Wales to win and that's a worry.\"\n\nHowever Wales head coach Tandy believes the team still has the support of the nation.\n\n\"We love the connection with our communities and nation. Even with limited numbers, when they get behind the team at the end, it does inspire the players,\" he said after Sunday's game.\n\n\"I understand there is lots going on and has been in Wales for a really long time, but we want to unify everything.\n\n\"We're a small nation, we need everything to be flowing in the right direction. I genuinely believe everyone needs to play their part in how we get there. There needs to be some patience to get change. It doesn't happen overnight. \"",

    "description": "Does 183 team changes in 14 ties devalue the FA Cup? Chief football writer Phil McNulty insists the cup retains its old magic.",
    "fullText": "The changing face of the FA Cup was graphically illustrated by the vast total of 183 team changes in the 14 fourth-round ties played over the weekend.\n\nMass alterations started as the preserve of Premier League clubs manipulating squads when priorities started to lie elsewhere, but they have now been joined by their lower-league counterparts.\n\nHull City made 10 changes for the 4-0 loss at home to Chelsea, while Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna made the same number for their defeat at Championship rivals Wrexham.\n\nThey are both in the Championship play-off places while Oxford United, fighting to stay in the division, made eight for their narrow home defeat to Premier League Sunderland.\n\nBlack Cats head coach Regis le Bris made six changes, but was vindicated as he can now contemplate a fifth-round tie.\n\nThe total works out at an average of a little more than 13 changes for each tie, so is the glamour and the much-cherished magic of the FA Cup being diluted by the lack of full-strength teams?\n\nOr does it actually even matter?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nBrilliant Mansfield pile pressure on Parker - is his time up at Burnley?\n\nTry asking Mansfield Town supporters if the FA Cup is a devalued commodity, after the side sitting 13th in League one took 3,500 supporters to Turf Moor and beat top-flight Burnley 2-1, despite manager Nigel Clough making six changes.\n\nTry asking the Burnley fans who reacted furiously at the final whistle whether it matters. Their pain was clear, the anger voluble.\n\nClarets manager Scott Parker, with Premier League survival as his target, made nine changes from a dramatic victory at Crystal Palace, only to see the decision backfire.\n\nParker may be able to play down the result should Burnley stay up, but it still represents another serious blot on his copybook. And will be remembered if they are relegated.\n\nThe FA Cup still retains its unique pulling power, whoever is on the teamsheet.\n\nA full house watched West Ham only scrape past League One strugglers Burton Albion after extra time, while Leeds United's victory on penalties over Birmingham City at St. Andrew's carried a real throwback feel to it.\n\nOne head coach who has clearly learned not to play fast and loose with the FA Cup is Liverpool's Arne Slot, who made a relatively conservative four changes from their win at Sunderland for a 3-0 fourth-round win against Brighton at Anfield.\n\nSlot was memorably stung at the same stage last season when he made 10 alterations for a tricky tie at then Championship side Plymouth Argyle.\n\nHe compounded his error by leaving the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah at home, Liverpool's shadow team losing 1-0 in a memorably raucous atmosphere at Home Park.\n\nIt was the object lesson that the FA Cup is not to be messed with, as it can still produce the moments that can make memories for a lifetime.\n\nThe most magical of all may yet await when sixth-tier Macclesfield face Brentford, seventh in the Premier League, on Monday as they try to repeat their sensational third-round win at home to Crystal Palace.\n\nThe atmosphere at Moss Rose will be red hot once more. This will be the archetypal FA Cup occasion. Brentford will have been warned by Crystal Palace's downfall, so their teamsheet will be of interest.\n\nIt has become a delicate, hazardous balancing act as the FA Cup represents a genuine chance for those clubs who have no hope of challenging for the Premier League – or success elsewhere.\n\nThere are many factors managers and clubs throughout the pyramid must weigh up, often involving serious financial consequences, which has unquestionably placed what is still regarded by many as the greatest cup competition in the world down their pecking order.\n\nThe FA Cup, come what may, will always retain a special place in the hearts and minds of the public, irrespective of how many team changes are made.\n\nThe pressure of games and preservation of players under physical strain also play into the thoughts of managers, with consequences for the cup.\n\nIt has not stopped the Premier League's heavyweights making their way into the last 16, with Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle United all now sensing that increased anticipation of a Wembley appearance.\n\nAnd as the FA Cup comes closer to the sharp end, it will be intriguing to measure the number of changes compared to earlier rounds.\n\nThis is a different competition from days gone by, but it still retains much of its old allure and results like Macclesfield's against Palace and Mansfield's unseating of Burnley will remain part of its glorious narrative.\n\nAnd that will never change, no matter the names on a teamsheet or those out on the pitch.\n\nEvery player, and every supporter, will still have that dream of an appearance in the FA Cup final at Wembley in their thoughts.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Team GB's men's curlers suffered their second defeat of the Winter Olympics but remain on course for a semi-final place, after they followed a victory over Germany with a nerve-shredding extra-end loss to Switzerland on Sunday.\n\nBruce Mouat's rink were edged out 6-5 by the Swiss in a high-grade repeat of last year's World Championship final, after a fuss-free 9-4 dismantling of the Germans earlier in the day.\n\nThe world champions have won four of their opening six matches, with another couple needed to guarantee a place in the last four and a shot at the medals high in the Dolomites in northern Italy.\n\n\"It was a great game,\" vice-skip Grant Hardie told BBC Sport. \"It could have gone either way but they took their chance in the end.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nThe Scottish quartet were in command throughout against the Germans, leading 5-2 at the break before accelerating clear, but the hitherto unbeaten Swiss proved more obdurate opposition.\n\nMouat's men led 3-2 at the break - a steal in the third proved the difference - and it took until the seventh end for either side to register a score greater than one.\n\nIt was the Swiss who did it, to lead 4-3, but it all came down to the last end.\n\nBritain needed one to tie, two to win. They had to settle for the former, meaning an extra end. But Switzerland had the hammer and they held their nerve to close out a statement victory.\n\n\"On another day we come away with the win,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's going to be tough to beat them but we know we are playing pretty well and it would be exciting to play them again.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Britain's women were unable to repeat their statement win over Canada against the Swedish rink who denied them European gold in November.\n\nThe unbeaten Swedes raced out to a 7-3 lead at the break - after twice scoring three with the hammer - and stole one in the sixth to take a stranglehold on the game.\n\nRebecca Morrison's rink kept fighting but ultimately fell to a 10-7 defeat to leave their semi-final hopes in the balance.\n\nAt least four wins will be required from their final five round-robin matches to have any hope of reaching the knockouts.\n\n\"It's really hard at this level - it's near-misses and we're a couple of centimetres away from making great shots,\" Morrison told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's frustrating but that's what happens at the Olympics. You need to be at your best and we just weren't quite there.\"\n\nThe women are back on the ice against Denmark (08:05 GMT) and Switzerland (18:05) on Monday, while the men face Norway (13:05).\n\nAnastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby safely progressed to the final round of the pairs figure skating after recording a season-best score.\n\nThe duo, who are the first British representatives in this Olympic event since 2014, endured a troubled build-up to the Games after Digby suffered a wrist injury which limited their ability to practice lifts.\n\nAnd in the team event at the start of the Games, Vaipan-Law suffered a fall during their throw triple Salchow, meaning there were worries about whether they would finish in the top 16 of the short program – needed to qualify for the free skate.\n\nBut they assuaged those doubts with a slick routine as Vaipan-Law landed the throw well before their final spin was synchronised perfectly.\n\nDigby was grinning even before their routine concluded, and was proven right as they scored 66.07, their highest score of the 2025-26 season.\n\n\"That little celebration at the end was me releasing all the emotion of it going exactly as I wanted it to,\" Vaipan-Law told the BBC.\n\nThey qualify in 13th place, meaning they will perform fourth in the free skate tomorrow – and will aim to better their best World Championship finish of 12th.\n\n\"Seeing so many British flags, that energy gave us a little extra,\" said Digby. \"We kept our heads and we were nice and calm. A clean skate, we couldn't ask for any more at the Olympics.\"\n\nGermany's Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin, who last year won world silver, lead at the half-way point with a score of 80.01.\n\nEuropean champions Anastasia Metelkina and Luka Berulava are second as they aim to win a first-ever Winter Olympic medal for Georgia, while Canada's Lia Pereira and Trennt Michaud are currently in bronze position.\n\nAdele Nicoll made history by becoming the first British woman to compete in the monobob at the Olympics and sits 13th at the halfway point at the Cortina sliding track.\n\nThe 29-year-old clocked a time of 2:00:83 over the two heats, 1.71 seconds off Germany's Laura Nolte in top spot.\n\nIt is unlikely Nicoll will trouble the medals but a top-10 finish would likely represent a successful Games for the Welsh slider, who was a travelling reserve for the Beijing 2022 Games but will also contest the two-woman event at Milan-Cortina.\n\n\"I was more nervous than maybe I'd realised for the first run and I felt a little bit like jelly on the block,\" she said.\n\n\"Seeing the Milan-Cortina Olympic rings was really surreal and emotional. These were all first experiences, I just wanted to do myself proud.\"\n\nNicoll is also a three-time British shot put champion and is targeting an appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Mica Moore, who represented Team GB four years ago but has since opted to compete for Jamaica, sits 15th on 2:00:98 before Monday's medal-deciding heats.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "An Olympic gold medal on snow has long seemed like the impossible for Team GB's winter athletes. One hundred and two years, to be exact.\n\nBut for those in the know, it has been just a matter of time.\n\nIn winning the mixed team snowboard cross title in Livigno on Sunday, Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale have written themselves into the history books, forever to be known as the first - yet it has been a very real prospect for a while.\n\nIn 2018, GB Snowsport set the lofty ambition of Great Britain becoming a top five snow sport nation by 2030.\n\nIt was a target set to build on the success of snowboarder Jenny Jones, Team GB's first medallist on snow with her 2014 bronze, and the same colour won by freestyle skier Izzy Atkin and snowboarder Billy Morgan four years later.\n\nBut it was also a target that raised eyebrows and smirks, and perhaps with four years to go, may still be a touch too ambitious - but the trajectory of progression is undeniable.\n\nIn Bankes - both individually and with Nightingale - Mia Brookes and Zoe Atkin, GB has world champions on snow. It has overall multiple Crystal Globe winners, X Games and World Cup gold medallists too.\n\n\"We've been saying we've got the talent, we've been showing the talent in World Championships and World Cups, but everybody looks to the Olympics because everything is amplified,\" GB Snowsport chief executive Vicky Gosling told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Here we are, actually producing that gold. For us, that is massive.\n\n\"We've said that anything is possible. We have amazing Brits with grit and amazing talent, it's all about unlocking that.\n\n\"People can truly see it's possible and we can deliver Olympic medals.\n\n\"Hopefully we are inspiring the next generation to get themselves to snow domes and get themselves prepared because the future is looking rosy.\"\n\nSpeaking after Sunday's gold, Nightingale said: \"What we've shown today, we are becoming a top snow sports nation and that's great for kids to see.\n\n\"We inspire kids to go on the slopes and go snowboarding or skiing or whatever it is, just try out winter sports.\n\n\"As a nation, if we get young kids into it, we can do very well.\"\n\nGB's Bankes & Nightingale win historic snowboard gold\n\nYes, it's right to say that the Milan-Cortina Games has not gone to plan for some British snow athletes so far.\n\nBut Olympic medal tables do not tell the full story, and are not the be-all and end-all.\n\nSnowboarder Brookes finished an agonising fourth in the big air - despite almost landing a never-before-seen trick in competition - and failed to qualify for the slopestyle final.\n\nYet despite not winning Olympic gold, silver or bronze as anticipated after her previous World Championship title and double X Games gold, she is a diamond on the British books and one of the biggest names in her sport.\n\nShe is just 19 and could well lead the British challenge at multiple Winter Olympics in the future - if she decides to continue down that avenue.\n\nThat's because Brookes is a snowboarder's snowboarder, a \"purist's dream\", who takes far more joy in shredding on a powder day than competing on the world stage.\n\nSo highly respected is she in her sport that every brand wants to work with her - BBC Sport understands it is just a case of name your price.\n\nNext year, her own line of Oakley goggles will hit the market. She already has her own Mia Brookes CAPiTA snowboard, and a boots line with Vans.\n\nIn Muir and Atkin, Great Britain also has two of the world's best freestyle skiers.\n\nLike Brookes, Muir missed out on an Olympic medal by the narrowest of margins, just 0.41 points separating her from bronze in the slopestyle, but she has another chance in the big air on Monday after qualifying fourth - with plenty still in her locker.\n\nAtkin, meanwhile, is the current halfpipe world champion and X Games gold medallist, and will get her campaign under way on 21 February.\n\nAway from the flagship park and pipe squad, Andrew Musgrave - competing at his fifth Olympics - finished sixth in the 10km interval start freestyle to post Britain's best finish in a Winter Olympic cross-country skiing event.\n\nThe Alpine skiing squad - Dave Ryding, Laurie Taylor and Billy Major - compete on Monday in the slalom.\n\nIn 2022, Ryding won Britain's first World Cup gold in the sport and will retire at the end of the season with seven podiums under his belt, while Taylor achieved a career-best fourth earlier in the season.\n\nWhat makes GB's snow athletes' achievements all the more remarkable is the limited budget on which the team operates.\n\nAs Gosling told BBC Sport before the Games got under way, \"we've punched way above our weight in terms of the deliverables\".\n\nUK Sport ploughed £7.2m into the ski and snowboard Olympic programme over the Milan-Cortina four-year cycle, more than any other winter sport but a mere fraction of the budget on what other nations are running.\n\nIt equates to £1.8m per year, a limited amount given the amount of global travel required for not just the athletes, but their coaches and support staff too, and so the governing body - which has just seven full-time members of staff at its London headquarters - has had to turn its hand to sourcing alternative funding through commercial revenue and sponsorship deals.\n\nThe sticking point for any GB success on snow has always been the lack of snowy mountains and freestyle courses, but that is not as convincing an argument as it once was.\n\nYes, many of Team GB's athletes have honed their crafts overseas - Bankes is Hemel Hempstead-born but grew up in the French Alps, while Nightingale hails from Bolton but moved to Austria with his parents.\n\nBut Jones and Morgan both learned on dry slopes in the UK. Looking at the current crop, Brookes grew up riding the rails at the indoor ski centre in Manchester, while Muir learned her craft in Aberdeen. Ryding raced on plastic in Lancashire until he was 21.\n\n\"We have over 60 facilities in the UK,\" said Gosling. \"We produce amazing talent and we have showed it time and time again over the past few years.\n\n\"Now it's about nurturing the talent and building the pathways needed and [putting] more emphasis and funding into it.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

The chance for lower elevation snowflakes tomorrow is low for several reasons — including the fact that moisture won't arrive until after temperatures have risen a few degrees above freezing. The early part of the morning will probably be dry.\n\nOnce the rain arrives, if it falls heavily enough, it could locally cool the atmosphere to drag down snow levels to the surface. Even then, showers don't look very impressive. Accumulations are unlikely. If anything were to briefly stick early on, it would be isolated and mainly confined to patio furniture and grassy surfaces — and even that is a stretch. \n\nBottom line: this is not looking like a big deal. The early drive will be dry. By 9–11 a.m., wet roads could slow you down. Any wet snowflakes will transition over to plain rain into the afternoon, with highs on Monday in the mid-40s.\n\nArea ski resorts will see minor accumulations to its snowpack amid a challenging lack of snowfall for this winter season.\n\nFor the Cascade region, reports indicate there could be up to two feet of snow for the upcoming week, including at Washington ski resorts in need of snow this year.\n\nSnow levels will lower from around 3000' on Sunday all the way down to as low as 500' later in the week.  Some much-needed snow returns to the mountains Monday with additional chances during the week.\n\nAfter a dry Sunday, our weather will quickly become cool and showery during the week with chances of wet snowflakes mixed in each day.  Overnight lows will be frosty, near freezing every morning.\n\nHeading into February, the snow pack in Washington was only at about 40% of its average, with chances to make that up by the end of the season quickly dropping.\n\nCity of Seattle settles lawsuit over death of Jaahnavi Kandula\n\nSome gift cards sold at Costco are now worthless\n\nSeahawks Super Bowl parade: Video, highlights, more from downtown Seattle\n\nSemi full of candy crashes on Highway 18 in Covington\n\nCrowds climb, damage Seattle's historic pergola after Seahawks Super Bowl win\n\nTo get the best local news, weather and sports in Seattle for free, \n\nDownload the free FOX LOCAL app for mobile in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for live Seattle news, top stories, weather updates and more local and national news.",

    "fullText": "Bill Maher eviscerated President Donald Trump over the “biggest dick move in American history,” following the rolling back of climate change regulations.\n\nOn the Friday, February 13 episode of Real Time With Bill Maher, the late-night host, 70, took aim at the POTUS, 79, over his remarks — and recent actions — involving global warming.\n\n“Trump has always said it’s a hoax, the whole thing with climate change,” Maher explained. “He said, scientists, he says, are ‘stupid people.’ He says, the idea that greenhouse gases cause climate change, there’s no basis in fact.”\n\nThat’s when the stand-up comedian pointed out, “He thinks it’s just some bulls*** that people made up out of nothing to get rich. You know, like crypto.”\n\nOn February 12, the Trump administration rescinded a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declaration stating that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a danger to public health. The Associated Press reported that the repeal eliminates all greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and could result in a larger repeal of climate regulations on things like power plants and oil and gas facilities.\n\nOf the move, Maher said, “And, yes, his EPA director, Lee Zeldin, said this is the single, this is a quote, ‘single largest deregulatory action in American history.'”\n\nHe then bluntly declared, “Probably true. Also the biggest dick move in American history.”\n\nIn September 2025, Trump slammed the concept of climate change during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” the POTUS said, per PBS. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nReal Time With Bill Maher, Fridays at 10/9c, HBO\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — A 15th-century statue that once stood outside Milan’s iconic Duomo has found a new home.\n\nThe Bearded Saint with Book was recently restored under the “Adopt a Statue” program, launched in 2020 by the centuries-old institution that oversees the cathedral’s conservation. As of Feb. 13, it is on display at Piazzale Cadorna, behind a glass window at the headquarters of FNM, a Lombardy-based transport company.\n\nThe program recruits donors — either companies or individuals — to fund restoration of a statue under a loan agreement that allows it to occasionally be displayed outside the Duomo.\n\n“The uniqueness of this project is that statues that would otherwise remain in our deposits are restored and brought back to their original beauty,” the program’s project manager, Elisa Mantia, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “In that way, they can continue to tell the story of the Duomo even in places that are far from the monument.”\n\nThese agreements are in some cases granted for an initial one-year term and may be renewed. The initiative follows previous fundraising campaigns in which donors could adopt gargoyles or spires in exchange for inclusion in the Duomo’s donor register, where contributors’ names are recorded as part of the cathedral’s long history of support.\n\nThe construction of the Duomo began in 1386, under the rule of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, then lord of Milan, in collaboration with the city’s archbishop. The cathedral was built on the site of two preexisting basilicas and its completion took more than five centuries. One of its bronze doors was not installed until 1965.\n\nBecause construction spanned centuries, the Duomo’s statues were carved by artists from different regions and periods, resulting in a monument that reads as a timeline of evolving artistic styles.\n\nThe Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, which oversees the cathedral’s conservation, has sought funding to restore statues removed over the centuries for maintenance or safety reasons.\n\n“Culture can save the world,” Andrea Gibelli, president of FNM, said during a press conference on Feb. 13 to mark the unveiling of Bearded Saint with Book. “We want to spread the cultural riches we are fortunate to have, which are often overlooked or not fully appreciated.\"\n\nOther sculptures adopted under the program by different sponsors have included a 16th-century David, a depiction of Samson and the Lion, and a statue of Saint Matthew the Apostle.\n\nWhile the number of adopted statues isn't disclosed and not all are displayed in public spaces, Mantia said that her institution has preselected around 30 sculptures as eligible for restoration. Each case must be authorized by Italy’s cultural heritage authorities, as the process involves a formal loan agreement subject to conservation, insurance and transport regulations.\n\n“We usually select them because they are very beautiful and not so damaged that they would be unsafe to loan,” Mantia said.\n\nOnce a donor reaches out, experts like Mantia accompany them to the Duomo’s storage facilities to choose a sculpture. After it is selected, restoration typically takes between one and three months.\n\nBearded Saint with a Book was originally displayed outdoors. Aside from a black crust from air pollution on its surface, it had no structural damages preventing its loan.\n\n“This often involves only surface finishing or an intervention with compresses or mechanical cleaning,” Mantia said.\n\nThe marble used for both the statues and the Duomo itself comes from the quarries of Candoglia in Italy’s Piedmont region. The same stone has been used since the late 14th century, under the supervision of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo.\n\n“Beyond being the symbol of Milan, the Duomo is also a symbol of its history,” Mantia said. “It is a monument that grew together with the city, that tells within itself, in its statues and in the style with which it is decorated, the entire history of the city.”",

    "title": "I got laid off from Amazon after 11 years. My high school daughter taught me the biggest lesson on how to move forward.",
    "description": "An ex-Amazon manager says his layoff in October 2025 was a shock, but he's using this time to build AI skills, focus on his health, and apply to jobs.",
    "fullText": "Hemant Virmani was laid off from Amazon during the October 2025 round of layoffs.\n\nHe's using this time to learn new AI skills while applying to engineering roles — and exercising.\n\nHis teenage daughter has inspired him to stay positive, keep his cool, and focus on the future.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hemant Virmani, a 47-year-old tech professional based in Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAmazon was part of my daily life for 11.5 years, and suddenly it was gone.\n\nThere's no right way or easy way to do layoffs. I watched my team members get laid off in 2023, and I know how difficult it is. Still, when I received an email in the middle of the night in October 2025 saying I'd been laid off from my senior software development manager position, I was shocked.\n\nWatching my teenage daughter navigate her own difficult situation taught me the biggest lesson in how to move forward well. Now I'm applying to jobs and working on upskilling in AI so I can be proactive, not reactive, to the tech industry.\n\nOnly time will tell if this layoff is a blessing in disguise, but for now, it has led to a refreshing change.\n\nI loved my time at Amazon, and I really feel as though it's a place for exceptional people. The number of quality brains in the office, throwing around ideas and solving a custom problem, was amazing.\n\nThe morning after my layoff, I had a mandated 30-minute meeting with my manager, and it actually went very well. We talked about the layoff, and he offered me support. He delivered it all to me in a very positive, human way, and it was really affirming.\n\nAn old manager also reached out to meet me at a local coffee shop the next day to spend time together and check in on my state of mind. I think he wanted to go about the layoffs right, which isn't easy to do.\n\nI felt attached to the layoff for the first few days; however, I knew there was no way to control what happened — I could only control how I reacted to it.\n\nMy daughter is a senior in high school, and she had an adverse situation happen to her last year that required recovery. How she reacted in that difficult time inspired me. Her mental model was: \"Challenges don't have to keep me from showing up for myself or for others.\" Her positive attitude was inspiration for me to do the same.\n\nI kind of learned from her that I had to take this layoff with positivity, keep my cool, and focus on what was next.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I lost my father and spent the next month in India supporting my family. I took about a month to settle my mind, reflect on what I wanted next for my career, and help my daughter finish her college essays.\n\nIt's been a very refreshing change to think about what I want next in my engineering career. I'm less focused on the size or name of the next company I work for, and more on what I'd be doing there. I'm looking forward to hopefully heading the engineering for something that has a great impact on customers. Right now, I don't think that can be done without AI, so I'm working on upskilling.\n\nI want to be proactive, not reactive, about the AI skills I'll need in the future. My team at Amazon used some AI tools, so I'm familiar with some, but I was only able to spend a fraction of my workday using them. Now, I'm building those skills myself.\n\nI started working on a hobby AI project a couple of weeks ago, to go hands-on with AI and be more grounded in the reality of what the AI landscape is like right now. It's been different, and a refreshing change, to build something myself rather than to study it, read about it, or work on a team developing it.\n\nWhen I had a job, it was easy for my first priority to be work. Now I'm making sure that my top priority is my health. I've been going to the gym four or five days a week, and I'm refining a health plan to follow even after I start working again.\n\nOnce I'm done at the gym, my time is a 50/50 split between learning AI and applying to jobs or networking. I'm applying for head of engineering roles where I'd own significant impactful initiatives, averaging 2-3 applications every week.\n\nI made a post on LinkedIn about my layoff, and I received so many supportive comments, texts, and calls from people — some I hadn't talked to in decades. Someone from college whom I hadn't talked to in over 25 years reached out, and it was so nice. It felt like we never disconnected. I've also had multiple job leads come from my post, which I'm following up on.\n\nAs of now, I have some worries about when I'll find my next job, but this time has given me the ability to work on things I wasn't able to before. I'm making sure I spend this time with a lot of positivity, not letting negative thoughts come around.\n\nMy advice to anyone undergoing layoffs is to realize that layoffs are not about you. It's about an environment that is driving layoffs. Secondly, now that this has happened, you can't go back in the past and change it. Look forward to what you can do next. How you react is very important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from Amazon? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "After a weekend of FA Cup action without VAR, BBC Sport ask managers, fans and pundits whether the game needs technology - and what needs to change.",
    "fullText": "Would football be better without the video assistant referee (VAR) system?\n\nPremier League fans, managers and players got a reminder of what life was like without VAR in the FA Cup fourth round - and it is fair to say this weekend was not without its problems.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, VAR has not been brought in until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nAfter a season full of controversy, delayed decisions and confusion fuelled by VAR, its very existence has been questioned at times, with many claiming the game would be better without it.\n\nIn fact, after a day full of long delays, mixed messages and irate managers in early February, ex-Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Match of the Day: \"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\"\n\nAfter a couple of offside goals being allowed, a blatant penalty not being awarded plus various other controversial decisions, the weekend certainly brought the subject back into the public eye.\n\nLong delays, irate managers and mixed messages - is VAR bad for game?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nWe have all heard the arguments against VAR.\n\nDecisions taking too long, celebrations being put on hold while deliberations take place, confusion as goals are given - or ruled out - for marginal reasons, denying referees the ability to use their own common sense.\n\nBut Newcastle's controversial 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday could hardly have gone better for supporters of VAR - or worse for those who argue football is better without it.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener was clearly offside, Villa's full-back Lucas Digne inexplicably escaped conceding a penalty for handball and the Frenchman could easily have been dismissed for a reckless challenge as well.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold, especially us today when we were on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery went further, saying \"VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees\".\n\nThere was also some controversy at Anfield during Liverpool's 3-0 win over Brighton.\n\nSubstitute Rio Ngumoha, 17, had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside for the hosts, while the Seagulls were furious Mohamed Salah was awarded a penalty.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"In general, I enjoy watching football without VAR because if you then score you're like 'it's a goal'.\n\n\"I like VAR only for the clear and obvious things - I'm not meaning a red card yes or no for Marc Guehi on Mo Salah because I thought it was.\n\n\"So let's stay away from that and only go to offside yes or no, ball over the line yes or no and, for the rest, the referee referees the game.\n\n\"I think we're now so used to VAR that I would prefer to have VAR during a game.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola was unsure whether football was better with VAR, despite seeing Omar Marmoush denied a goal for a debatable offside in his side's 3-0 win against Salford.\n\n\"Sometimes before I thought it was better and sometimes I think VAR helps us to have a more fair game,\" he said. \"To be honest I don't know.\"\n\nFor some though, it is simple - rather than VAR being a solution for wrong decisions, they would argue officials just need to get things right.\n\nWhen asked on Match of the Day Live whether the errors at Villa Park put him in favour of VAR, ex-Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, said: \"No. I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it?\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think Saturday is a great example of that.\n\n\"These guys look petrified to make a decision because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\n\n\"For me, [referees' decisions] are actually getting worse.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given added on Match of the Day: \"It shows you why we use VAR. A lot of decisions the officials got wrong at Villa Park. VAR is like a comfort blanket for referees.\n\n\"The decision is taken away from the officials. The linesman has been told all season not to put their flag up, so their brain has been trained. I think it shows VAR is a help even though we complain about it most weeks.\"\n\nWhen asked whether football had become too reliant on VAR, Howe had some sympathy with the argument.\n\n\"There is an argument to say yes,\" he said. \"Because when VAR is there, there is a tendency to think 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'.\n\n\"Then your decision making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there. I would probably say you are right in that respect.\"\n\nBut former referee Graham Scott feels it is unfair to claim officials hide behind VAR.\n\n\"I really don't think that's fair,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"Obviously I work with them closely and I know these guys and they're not like that. It's not how their minds work, not how their processes work.\n\n\"I spent half my career with VAR and half without it - the other way around of course, without it first.\n\n\"And then when I was in the Premier League I was still dropping into the Championship quite often. So you're in and out, in and out. And your processes essentially stay the same.\n\n\"What has changed though is with VAR you don't have that spell in a game where you know you've made a really big error and you now have to reset and go again.\"\n\nJames: Football without VAR is real football. Having gone to games for the last 30 years, the last few years have been terrible in comparison. I don't bother cheering goals any more as the officials are far more interested in finding ways of disallowing goals than the entertainment of the match-going fan.\n\nVAR will be the thing that makes me turn in my season ticket, and if West Ham do get relegated the lack of VAR will be a blessing.\n\nFrank: I supported the introduction of VAR, but it was great not having it today. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many VAR ridiculous errors.\n\nAlan: Much, much better [without]. VAR has ruined the game, thankfully I now support non-league football where there are humans, making human mistakes and getting it right.\n\nStephen: Much better without VAR. No waiting for obvious incidents that everyone can see immediately but takes VAR forever to decide. Time for return of refs and linesman to start refereeing the game again.\n\nMike: Better, even though City probably had a goal chalked off incorrectly. Right or wrong, its so much better to just know immediately if its a goal or not. VAR is a moment-killer.\n\nLes: The game is so much better without VAR. It flows without problem like it used to do. The officials are there to make decisions rightly or wrongly. VAR are always making wrong calls so I can't see the point of it. Offside because someone's toes are on the lines drawn is absolutely pathetic.\n\nBonnie: As a Villa and VAR fan, that is exactly the decision that VAR doesn't get credit for. VAR gets it right 100%\n\nRoger: That was so blatantly offside, have linesman lost their natural ability to spot stuff like this since the introduction of VAR? Whenever you see a defence hold their line like Newcastle did, strikers are more often than not offside. Poor decision.\n\nPeter: There's an easy fix for VAR offsides. If you can watch one TV replay and see the on-field decision is clearly wrong, you intervene.\n\nStephen: That's what you all wanted isn't it? More goals regardless of whether they're actually fair or not?\n\nLiga: It's these types of situations and these types of situation only where VAR should and needs to be used for offsides. Not those hairline millimetre is he on or off line drawing nonsense situations.\n\nCallum: This season is proving 2 things. 1) VAR is a must. 2) Brave, high pressure attacking football is dead.\n\nBen: What are linesman for exactly? Having no VAR is a another shambles, who makes these decisions?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "A Chicago teen who spoke out for her father’s release after he was detained last fall by immigration officials in a deportation case has died after battling a rare form of cancer.\n\nOfelia Giselle Torres Hidalgo, 16, died Friday from stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the family said in a statement. Funeral arrangements are private.\n\nThe teenager was diagnosed in December 2024 with the aggressive form of soft tissue cancer and had been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment.\n\nAn immigration judge in Chicago ruled three days before Ofelia’s death that her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was conditionally entitled to receive “cancellation of removal” due to the hardships his deportation would cause his children who were born in the United States and are US citizens, according to the statement sent by an attorney representing Torres Maldonado.\n\nThe ruling provides Torres Maldonado with a path to becoming a lawful permanent resident and eventual US citizenship, the statement said.\n\nOfelia was present via Zoom at last week’s hearing.\n\n“Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threatened deportation of her father,” said Kalman Resnick, Torres Maldonado’s attorney. “We mourn Ofelia’s passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what’s right to our last breaths.”\n\nTorres Maldonado, a painter and home renovator, was detained October 18 at a Home Depot store in suburban Chicago as the area was at the center of a major immigration crackdown dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” which began in early September.\n\nOfelia was undergoing treatment when she appeared in October in a video posted on a GoFundMe page set up for the family.\n\n“My dad, like many other fathers, is a hard-working person who wakes up early in the morning and goes to work without complaining, thinking about his family,” she said in the video. “I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted just because they were not born here.”\n\nIn a wheelchair, she attended a hearing for her father in October. The family’s attorneys told a judge at that time that she was released from the hospital just a day before her father’s arrest so she could see family and friends. They added Ofelia had been unable to continue treatment “because of the stress and disruption.”\n\nTorres Maldonado’s attorneys petitioned for his release as his deportation case went through the system. A judge ordered a bond hearing after ruling in October his detention was illegal and violated Torres Maldonado’s due process rights.\n\nA judge later cited Torres Maldonado’s lack of criminal history while allowing his release on a $2,000 bond.\n\nLawyers said Torres Maldonado entered the US in 2003. He and his partner, Sandibell Hidalgo, also have a younger son.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security had alleged he had been living illegally in the US for years and has a history of driving offenses, including driving without a valid license, without insurance and speeding.",

    "description": "Premier League Wolves edge League Two Grimsby in an \"old school cup tie\" which provided an FA Cup \"throwback\".",
    "fullText": "It was, undeniably, an \"old school cup tie\" - one which both managers agreed provided \"a bit of a throwback\".\n\nThe pitch at Blundell Park was already a quagmire before kick-off between League Two Grimsby Town and Premier League Wolves, and rapidly deteriorated under relentless rainfall on the east coast.\n\nThe ball travelled unpredictably across the sodden surface. Players continued to slide for longer than expected. The pitch markings blurred in the mudbath.\n\nIt would be an understatement to suggest the conditions did not aid either team's ambitions of playing attractive football.\n\nBut they did produce fascinating scenes reminiscent of a bygone era, encapsulating the essence and charm of the FA Cup's history.\n\nThere would be no giant-killing here, however. Despite Grimsby's best efforts to test the visitors' resolve, top-flight strugglers Wolves squeezed into the fifth round by scoring from their only shot on target.\n\n\"It was a proper traditional old school cup tie,\" Grimsby boss David Artell told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It was going to be a fine margins game and that's how it was - we limited a Premier League team to one attempt on target and it's gone in.\n\n\"One chance, one goal for them. It showed how well we played in terrible conditions.\n\n\"The conditions made the game in some respects because it was a bit of a throwback.\"\n\nWolves edge past Grimsby on mudbath to reach fifth round\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards will take great encouragement from the gritty nature of his side's victory as they put their league struggles aside to reach the competition's last 16.\n\nThe 43-year-old reiterated to his players the importance of approaching their trip to face fourth-tier opposition with the right mentality, but his words could scarcely have prepared them for the messy reality on the ground.\n\nIndeed, for some of the Wolves players, this was a brutal introduction to the sort of tie which the FA Cup is famed.\n\n\"It was cold, wet, muddy and difficult conditions, but the lads did really well,\" Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It's mad, I quite enjoy these conditions. But there are not many lads in the dressing room who have seen the lower leagues in England.\n\n\"We go out every game to try and win. Our league form has not been great but a cup run would be unbelievable for us and the fans. Hopefully we can keep going and see where it takes us.\"\n\nWhile Wolves have managed just one win after 26 games in their dismal Premier League campaign, back-to-back FA Cup wins against League Two opponents has extended their cup interest into March.\n\nEdwards will hope the competition can yet provide some joy to supporters with relegation to the Championship seemingly inevitable - however the victories come.\n\n\"It was an aggressive game of headers and volleys,\" joked Edwards, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"They were really difficult conditions for both teams. It was a different type of game and a bit of a throwback.\n\n\"It was an eye-opener for a lot of the players when we arrived, the wind was sideways and there were puddles on the pitch.\n\n\"It was never going to be a day for beautiful football. We played with realism, we showed spirit and fight. We did the basics well and came through.\"\n\nEdwards added: \"It was all set up for a cup upset. We talked a lot about mentality over the past few days and the players showed a real desire to win.\"\n\nEdwards' players will have to adapt to a very different challenge on Wednesday, when they trade the Blundell Park mud for hosting Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\nFor Grimsby boss Artell, a \"bowling green\" surface much closer in quality to the one his side stunned Manchester United on in the League Cup earlier this season would also have been preferable.\n\nThe Mariners, on a 10-game unbeaten run stretching back to December, were full of confidence as they targeted another huge upset but were unable to capitalise on their late chances.\n\n\"From my side, we much prefer to play on a better pitch,\" Artell told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We have limited a Premier League side to one shot on target. I don't think either side did enough to win the game, but those are the fine margins.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

    "description": "BBC Scotland looks at Youssef Chermiti's impact for Rangers against Hearts and beyond.",
    "fullText": "A multi-million pound signing, openly derided and much-maligned. Yet, in the two biggest games of Rangers' season, he's been the hero.\n\nYoussef Chermiti cost the Ibrox club a fee of around £8m in the summer, having not scored a goal in two years.\n\nHis name was attached to criticism of former sporting director Kevin Thelwell, with his unconvincing early performances only adding fuel to the fire of his doubters.\n\nYet, against Celtic in the new year's derby, he came good. His two goals shot Rangers to a 3-1 win at Celtic Park, leading to Wilfried Nancy being sacked and pushing Danny Rohl's side past Celtic in the Scottish Premiership table for the first time this season.\n\nOn Sunday, he started in the biggest game of the season so far against league leaders Hearts. Trailing by five points, a win was a must.\n\nThanks to Chermiti, that's what they got.\n\nWith the weight of the world on his shoulders, the Portuguese striker scored a first ever career hat-trick and heaved a chunk of momentum back behind Rangers in the title charge.\n\nWatch: Rangers v Hearts - Sportscene highlights\n\nThe strangest thing about all this - Chermiti has scored just seven league goals this season. Five of them in two games. Two big games, right enough, but two games all the same.\n\nInterestingly enough, he is actually outperforming his xG of just 5.21, despite some notable misses.\n\nThe 21-year-old ranks just 15th in the league's strikers in that metric. When you look at his touches in the opposition box - 60 in total - he ranks down in 26th.\n\nIn 15 league games, 10 of which were starts, he went goalless. Before the 4-2 win over Hearts, he had drawn a blank in his past six games.\n\nFor all that, his impact in big games is immeasurable. Yet, pundit Michael Stewart remains unconvinced.\n\n\"He scored a hat-trick today, which is wonderful for him, but his all-round game is a little bit slack, and his touch at times is very unpredictable,\" said Stewart on Sportscene.\n\nThe opinion that really matters, though, is that of his gaffer and Rohl is clearly a big fan.\n\n\"You give him belief and trust,\" the head coach said through the week, when asked about his striker.\n\n\"You can imagine for Youssef, it's tough for him. Not about the reaction [from fans], it's more about how he feels.\n\n\"He knows he wants to score. He wants a lot for the group. He comes in a good situation. I wish that the next time he takes an extra touch and then he looks for the corner, he makes it.\n\n\"It will come, I totally believe, because I see a lot of things in him.\n\n\"It was the Celtic game when he scored, he turned the game with fantastic goals, and he can do this again. I believe, totally.\"\n\nNot a bad prediction from the 36-year-old, who has masterminded Rangers' resurgent form.\n\nPodcast: Dramatic Sunday in Premiership as Celtic & Rangers narrow gap on leaders Hearts\n\nIn Rohl's first weekend as Rangers boss, they leapt from eighth to fifth thanks to a 3-1 win over Kilmarnock, which featured Chermiti's first goal for the Ibrox club. They were 13 points behind Hearts before a ball was kicked.\n\nYet now, with 11 games of this rollercoaster season left, Rangers are just two behind Derek McInnes' pacesetters.\n\nIt's a turnaround that few could have predicted, and many Rangers fans had already effectively written the league off.\n\nIn 19 league matches in charge, Rohl has won 14, drawn four and lost just one - to Hearts at Tynecastle Park back in December.\n\n\"It's not been pretty for Rangers for the most of this season,\" former Rangers midfielder Scott Arfield said on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. \"Danny Rohl has gone in there and quietly got this team firing again.\"\n\nThe importance of the new head coach cannot be understated, and even caught the eye of Scotland boss Steve Clarke.\n\n\"He's found a way of playing that suits the squad of players that he's got,\" Clarke said on Sky Sports. \"He showed midweek [against Motherwell] that he's not afraid to make changes, so he trusts his squad.\n\n\"When you win matches you get more confidence. If you come in as a manager and start by winning games, immediately the players are going to be onside.\n\n\"The players are with him, the crowd are with him as well. It's been a really good run for Rangers and they're certainly doing very well at the moment.\"\n\nChermiti hat-trick earns Rangers seismic win over leaders Hearts\n\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "France were at their swaggering best in Wales to extend their bid for a first Six Nations Grand Slam since 2022 - so who could stop them?",
    "fullText": "Perhaps it was lost in translation, but Fabien Galthie's declaration that Grand Slam-chasing France \"performed reasonably\" against Wales should be enough to strike fear into Italy, Scotland and England.\n\nWhile the Welsh attempt to somehow avoid a third-straight Wooden Spoon, Les Bleus are hunting a first clean sweep since 2022.\n\nReigning champions France swatted aside Ireland in round one and ran eight tries past Wales in front of a large travelling contingent at the Principality Stadium.\n\nPart three of the Grand Slam bid is against dangerous Italy in Lille on Sunday before Scotland away and England in Paris.\n\n\"We can't stop moving forward,\" said Galthie. \"We are performing reasonably but nothing is sure.\n\n\"We expect a difficult encounter against Italy, so are still working. We had many great parts against Wales but we can do better.\"\n\nIn some ways, what Les Bleus achieved in Cardiff was nothing special - Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa had already hit Steve Tandy's side for half-centuries in the autumn.\n\nThe home side felt their performance was reasonable - and certainly better than in the round one hammering by England - yet they were still overwhelmed in all departments.\n\nFrance scored their first try after 88 seconds and had three inside the opening 15 minutes, with 20-year-old centre Fabien Brau-Boirie scoring on his debut and electric wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey going over for his 23rd try in 24 internationals.\n\nBielle-Biarrey's fellow wing Theo Attissogbe, who has replaced France's all-time record try-scorer Damian Penaud in the side, scored twice in the second half as the visitors claimed their biggest Six Nations triumph in the Welsh capital.\n\nThey could have had even more with an attack marshalled by Antoine Dupont and Matthieu Jalibert racking up 28 line breaks, 31 defenders beaten, 1,136 carry metres and 24 offloads.\n\nInstead, their final try came in the 60th minute from second row Charles Ollivon.\n\n\"When you play a team like that you have to be good at everything,\" said former England and British and Irish Lions captain Martin Johnson on BBC One.\n\n\"France had zero worries because they knew they were going to win, they knew they were too good.\n\n\"They're all so comfortable on the ball. When they're confident and there's no jeopardy, I was thinking 'thank god I'm not on that field'.\n\n\"It's so difficult to contain them when they're that confident and don't feel that anything is going to go wrong for them.\"\n\nJohnson won five Six Nations titles as a player but only two Grand Slams, so knows that potential banana skins lie ahead for Les Bleus.\n\n\"France are massive favourites to win this tournament, everyone is talking about how good they are,\" he said.\n\n\"You've got to deal with that expectation. They're looking very good, they've got huge depth, they've got massive confidence at the moment, but you've got to get them into a point where they feel pressure.\"\n\nFellow former Lions captain Sam Warburton - who won a Grand Slam and title with Wales - believes that is easier said than done.\n\n\"France have got that double-edged sword of physicality up front and the ball-playing ability out wide,\" said the former flanker.\n\n\"They're so potent in attack, they're so difficult to defend against. France are great, I love watching France.\"\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nThat swagger is providing plenty of entertainment for French supporters, who were rewarded for their long weekend in Cardiff with a thumping win.\n\nIt was Wales' smallest Six Nations crowd despite an impressive travelling contingent that boosted the coffers of the capital's pubs.\n\nPlenty will venture to Murrayfield with great expectations, and a little more trepidation.\n\n\"At the end when they were singing, we felt like we were in the Stade de France,\" said star scrum-half Dupont.\n\n\"It's incredible to feel that you are at home when playing away.\"\n\nA win in Lille and another in Edinburgh would give France the chance to secure an 11th Grand Slam against England, the last team to beat them in the Six Nations when Steve Borthwick's side clinched a dramatic 26-25 victory in round two of last year's championship.\n\nTandy is well placed to judge France's qualities after a tough start to his reign that has featured assignments against the Pumas, All Blacks, Springboks and England.\n\n\"They're in a great space to achieve that, but the Six Nations is funny,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"There's no complacency there and they are playing at a high level, so I don't see why they can't win the Grand Slam. They're a formidable outfit.\"\n\n'Murrayfield pain will make England a better team'\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC",

    "description": "Matt Weston becomes the first Briton to win two gold medals at a Winter Olympics with a thrilling victory in the mixed team skeleton alongside Tabitha Stoecker.",
    "fullText": "Team GB made history by winning two Winter Olympic titles on one day for the first time as Matt Weston and Tabitha Stoecker clinched mixed team skeleton gold.\n\nIt came after Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale won the snowboard cross mixed team event earlier on Sunday.\n\nWeston produced a stunning race to make more of his own history in Cortina - he is the first Briton to win two gold medals at a Winter Olympics having claimed individual gold just two days ago.\n\nStoecker, 25, had given Weston a tough task with her run of 1:00.77, 0.18 seconds off the pace of the Germans, with the British pair - ranked top seeds - the last to run.\n\nBut 28-year-old Weston, who won Team GB's first medal at the Games, showed why he is the best skeleton racer in the world with a sublime 58.59secs run to clinch a second medal with a final time of 1:59:36.\n\nIt is also the first time Great Britain have won three gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.\n\n\"The individual event is amazing but doing it as a team when we're normally an individual sport is amazing,\" said Weston.\n\n\"To have my team-mate by my side as Olympic champions, two-time for me which is crazy. I'm looking forward to the celebrations!\"\n\nA second British team, Marcus Wyatt and Freya Tarbit, missed out on a medal by an agonising 0.01secs as the two German teams of Christopher Grotheer and Jacqueline Pfeifer and Axel Jungk and Susanne Kreher took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nGB's Bankes & Nightingale win historic snowboard gold\n\nHow Weston handled pressure to win Olympic gold and GB's first medal\n\nWhy are Team GB so good at skeleton?\n\nThe mixed event, making its debut at Milan-Cortina, sees the sliders hurtle down the track one after the other with a quick reaction time crucial as five red lights going out prompts them to set off.\n\nPushing off before the lights go out results in heavy penalties or even disqualification and that led to many of the sliders erring on the side of caution with some hesitant starts.\n\nJanine Flock, who won gold on Saturday in the women's event, blew the Austrian team's chances when she incurred a one-second penalty for reacting too soon at the start, opening the door for both British teams to get on the podium.\n\nBut the two German teams were too good and the only way Wyatt and Tarbit could have got on the podium would have been if Weston and Stoecker had not.\n\nTwo-time world champion Weston came into this Games stating that only gold would be good enough and he will now walk away as the most decorated man in British Winter Olympics history.\n\nAfter finishing 15th in Beijing four years ago, Weston's rise in the sport has been meteoric and his two Olympic golds add to the three Crystal Globes - overall World Cup titles - he won consecutively from 2024.\n\nFormer bobsledder John Jackson, Olympic bronze medallist in 2014, said: \"Weston has been the cream of the crop of anybody on this track. We are witnessing history right here.\n\n\"He just keeps raising the bar to new standards, and that was absolutely nail-biting stuff when Tabby didn't quite have the run she wanted to give him a chance. Weston absolutely destroyed the field.\"\n\nAs Sunday's competition got increasingly exciting, building to a gripping finale, it was Weston who once again stepped up, having broken the track record in all four runs of the individual event, he produced another immaculate run to turn it into a Super Sunday for GB.\n\n\"Luckily I felt like I knew what I needed to do,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's all a bit of a whirlwind, I took confidence from the individual event and in my head I had to be quite boring and just get the job done.\"\n\nIt took Team GB a week of action in Italy to get their first medal on the board after a series of fourth-place finishes and near misses from the nation's other medal contenders.\n\nBut securing two gold medals in one day - with Bankes and Nightingale's a first ever on snow - certainly goes a long way to improving the landscape.\n\nWhile the one in Livigno came as a surprise, Weston and Stoecker's in Cortina marks a return to the norm for Team GB on the skeleton track.\n\nThe British team have a long history of Olympic skeleton success but a disastrous Games in 2022, where they failed to win a medal for the first time since the sport was reinstated at the Olympics in 2002, is now proving to be an anomaly.\n\nWeston was the heavy favourite coming into the men's event on Friday and he clinched gold with a winning margin of 0.88secs - the second-biggest in skeleton history.\n\nThen, although the British trio of women - Stoecker, Tarbit and Amelia Coltman - did not finish on the podium, they all ended inside the top 10 at their debut Games.\n\nWyatt, who finished ninth in the men's event, said: \"Me and Matt were there in Beijing [2022] and it was good to come and prove that that was a blip and not a trend.\n\n\"What these medals will do for the future of this programme for the next four, eight, 12 years - we are going to be expecting more medals and keeping that rich history of British skeleton alive.\"\n\nWhy first gold on snow has been just a matter of time",
