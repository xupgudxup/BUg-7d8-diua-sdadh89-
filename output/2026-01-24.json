    "fullText": "GLENDALE – Despite the team’s poor record, the Arizona Cardinals 2025 draft class played extraordinary well. Many of the rookies were thrusted into position far too soon because of injuries, and in a sink or swim environment, a majority swam. First-round pick Walter Nolen had one of the highest PFF grades in the NFL, while second-round pick Will Johnson was a lockdown corner for the team.\n\nFourth-rounder Cody Simon took on the role of green dot and did wonderfully, while the utter surprise arrival of fifth-rounder Denzel Burke was sensational. All four played a critical role of last year’s team, and as the franchise heads into 2026, which of these names will have an even bigger impact in Year 2.\n\nWith Nolen likely to miss time due to injury and Simon to have his role shrinked when Mack Wilson Sr. returns, it looks to be a two-horse race between Burke and Johnson.\n\nAug 9, 2025; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Arizona Cardinals cornerback Will Johnson (0) against the Kansas City Chiefs during a preseason NFL game at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\n“Burke’s rookie season was a roller coaster. The fifth-round pick was asked to handle a heavy workload, and despite that responsibility, he allowed just three touchdowns — with two coming against Ja’Marr Chase and Puka Nacua,” Pro Football Focus writer Zach Tantillo wrote. “He surrendered more than 25 receiving yards to only three wide receivers all year and recorded three interceptions to lead all rookie cornerbacks.”\n\nAug 9, 2025; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Arizona Cardinals cornerback Denzel Burke (29) against the Kansas City Chiefs during a preseason NFL game at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nBurke was arguably the best rookie defensive back in the NFL last year. The former Ohio State Buckeye had three interceptions and 11 pass deflections. Regardless of the injuries, the 23-year-old played himself into a starting role towards the end of the season. Even when the roster will be healthy, Burke will be on the field.\n\nJohnson was seen as the steal of the 2025 draft on the night. A fringe top-10 player that dropped to 47th overall to the Cardinals. The 22-year-old fell due to injury concerns, which did plague him in his rookie year. The first half of the season was rough, playing in five of the team’s first 12 games. However, he closed the season strong by playing in Arizona’s final six game.\n\nIn 12 games, Johnson had nine pass breakups, which was 12th in the NFL. He failed to record an interception in his first year, but came close many times throughout his appearances.\n\nNov 3, 2025; Arlington, Texas, USA; Arizona Cardinals cornerback Will Johnson (0) celebrates as he leaves the field after defeating the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-Imagn Images\n\nThe duo cornerbacks each showed amazing potential, but Johnson has the chance to take the biggest leap because of being sidelined by injuries for half of the year. Burke was a pleasant surprise, but one has to worry about the sophomore slump of a cornerback that overachieved. Johnson is the safer pick to have a healthier Year 2 and live up to his pre-draft comparisons.\n\nThe Cardinals secondary is filled with players like Garrett Williams and Max Melton that will get snaps. When healthy, Johnson will likely be the one getting more snaps. Burke played in 17 games but only had two games playing 100% of the defensive snaps, while Johnson had five instances.\n\nCardinals remain lone team interested in Raheem Morris for head coach position in 2026",

    "fullText": "Club América is close to finalizing what would be the most high-profile signing of the Clausura 2026. After intense negotiations, Las Águilas have reportedly reached a verbal agreement with Palmeiras for the Brazilian midfielder Raphael Veiga. The deal, which was unlocked thanks to the mediation of the coaching staff, is shaping up to be a loan with a mandatory purchase for next year.\n\nAlthough the official figures remain confidential, the total amount of the transfer would be around 10 million dollars. If completed, Veiga would become one of the highest-paid players on the azulcrema squad, with an estimated annual salary of 2.7 million dollars, which would be fully covered by the Coapa institution.\n\nDespite progress in Brazil, América faces an administrative problem: there are no available slots for Non-Mexican Trained Players (NFM). To register Veiga, the board is working against the clock to facilitate the departure of a foreign player, with two names on the table:\n\nVíctor Dávila: The Chilean is the main candidate to leave due to his inconsistent performance (9 goals in 4 tournaments), although his high salary complicates a return to his home country.\n\nJosé \"Pantera\" Zúñiga: A more viable exit option if a move within Liga MX can be arranged.\n\nIf the slots are freed up in the next few hours, the Brazilian star would travel to Mexico City this weekend to undergo medical exams and sign the contract that would officially link him with the current champion.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

The 24-year-old tight end rejoins the Steelers after a stint with the team during training camp and on the practice squad this past season.\n\nWe have signed TE J.J. Galbreath to a Reserve/Future contract. @BordasLaw\n\n— Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) January 23, 2026\n\nGalbreath originally joined the Steelers as an undrafted free agent out of South Dakota after the 2025 Draft. The six-foot-four pass catcher shone for the Coyotes, amassing 1355 yards and 13 touchdowns during his college career. Galbreath earned first-team AP All-American honors his senior season. However, he was cut during the team’s final roster cuts in August. Galbreath briefly rejoined the team on the practice squad, but was cut after week two and has been a free agent ever since.\n\nHe appeared in three preseason games for the Steelers this past season, but only collected three catches for 23 yards during his time on the field. This reserve/future deal will now give Galbreath a better chance to impress the new coaching staff during offseason workouts and in training camp in Latrobe.\n\nWith fellow tight end Connor Heyward set to become a free agent, Galbreath will now have another shot to potentially crack the 53-man roster this season for the Steelers.",

    "fullText": "The world of football witnessed another curious episode last Thursday (22).\n\nCoach Lúcio Flávio, who had arrived at Goiatuba with hopes of reviving the team in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano, requested to leave the club after leading the squad for just one round (four days of work).\n\nThe 46-year-old coach released a video announcing his departure and stating that he had accepted a new job offer — he was announced at Uberlândia, in Minas Gerais.\n\nA former midfielder who emerged at Paraná in the late 1990s, Lúcio Flávio played for major clubs in Brazilian football, such as Internacional, São Paulo, Coritiba, Atlético-MG, Vitória, and Santos.\n\nHowever, the club with which he is most closely identified is Botafogo, where he played between 2007 and 2008 and then again from 2009 to 2010.\n\nRetired from the pitch since 2017, Lúcio Flávio began his coaching career as an assistant at Paraná the following year.\n\nHe later served as assistant and interim coach at Botafogo between 2020 and 2023. The young coach also had stints at Aparecidense, São Joseense, and Brasiliense before arriving at Goiatuba at the start of the Goianão.\n\nAt Goiatuba, the team’s situation in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano was already difficult before Lúcio Flávio’s arrival.\n\nThe “Azulão do Sul” started the state championship with another coach, Augusto Fassina, who was dismissed after three winless matches.\n\nLúcio Flávio led the team in just one match, and with only one point on the table, the club remains at the bottom of the competition. The team still has four games ahead to try to escape relegation and dream of a spot among the top eight in the state championship.\n\nMeanwhile, Uberlândia is also going through a tough time. Before the coach’s arrival, the “Verdão” had two losses and two draws in four matches, sitting at the bottom of Group A in the Campeonato Mineiro.\n\nIn four games, the team has yet to win, suffered a 5-0 thrashing by Cruzeiro, and faces challenges ahead as they try to climb out of last place in their group in the state championship.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Calling all adrenaline junkies, Netflix has a broadcast specifically for you this week. Well, it’s specifically for adrenaline junkies who are probably not also stressed out by heights.\n\nOn Friday, professional climber Alex Honnold will be scaling his next mountain — except it’s not a mountain. Instead, he’ll be free-climbing a literal skyscraper, and yes, free-climbing means exactly what you think it does. He’ll have no ropes or harnesses attached, no safety nets to land in, he’s just…climbing a building.\n\nThe climb will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Netflix, on Friday, Jan. 23. It will be streamed live, so you can see the whole thing.\n\nAlex Hannold is a professional rock climber, who you might recognize from the documentary “Free Solo.” He’s a veteran at climbing.\n\nHannold will be scaling Taipei 101, one of the tallest buildings in the world. As you likely guessed from its name, the building is in Taiwan.\n\nIn total, Taipei 101 has, well, 101 stories. It’s 1,667 feet tall.\n\nIn Hannold’s own words: “Why not?” According to the climber, the building is “possible, which a lot of skyscrapers aren’t — it’s uniquely suited for climbing.”\n\nIt appears not. Hannold will truly solo climb and he admitted to Tudum himself that “My life is on the line.”\n\nAccording to Hannold himself, if something goes wrong, he’ll probably die, as he explained to CNN during a recent sit-down interview. However, as he noted, with this particular building, there are a lot of balconies spread out accross a long stretch of the climb “The geometry of the building, the shape of the building is such that you actually could fall in tons of places and not actually die,” Hannold described, “which makes it in some ways safer than a lot of rock-climbing objectives.”\n\nIn the same interview, Hannold described it as a low-risk, high-consequence activity — meaning that, most likely, he’ll incur no injury at all, but if something goes wrong, the stakes are extremely high. In contrast, he describes sports football as high-risk, lower-consequence, since athletes regularly have career-ending, but not life-ending, accidents on the field.\n\nProducers have also clarified that there will be a 10-second delay, and if the worst should happen, they will cut away.\n\nThe post ‘Skyscraper Live’: Where to Watch, Who’s Climbing and What Happens If He Falls appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Falcons listed as best landing spot for Super Bowl-winning quarterback originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe quarterback position in Atlanta is a bit up in the air right now. Michael Penix is the team’s QB of the future, but he might not be ready for the start of the 2026 season after suffering a torn ACL in November.\n\nThe Falcons also have veteran Kirk Cousins on the roster, but they could look to release him in a cost-cutting move in the coming weeks.\n\nIf they do move on from Cousins, they would need to identify another quarterback who could potentially serve as a starter in Penix’s absence and then shift to a reserve role. That’s where Joe Flacco could come in.\n\nIn a recent article, Kristopher Knox of Bleacher Report listed the Falcons as the best landing spot for Flacco, citing his relationship with new head coach Kevin Stefanski and ability to effectively operate as a fill-in starter.\n\n“If the Falcons don't retain Cousins as veteran insurance, Flacco would be the perfect alternative. Stefanski and Flacco helped take the Browns to the playoffs in 2023, and the pair could likely get Atlanta off to a hot start if Penix isn't ready to go when the season opens,” Knox wrote.\n\n“The Falcons don't quite have the receiving corps that the Bengals have, but Flacco would probably find success alongside Drake London, Bijan Robinson, and Kyle Pitts—assuming Pitts is retained in free agency.”\n\nFlacco would certainly be cheaper than Cousins, and even thought he’s 41 years old, he’s demonstrated that he can still run an offense at a high level.\n\nIn 13 games – and 10 starts – split between Cleveland and Cincinnati last season, Flacco threw for 2,479 yards and 13 touchdowns, compared to just four interceptions.\n\nFirst, the Falcons have to figure out what they want to do with Cousins. If they do decide to move on from him, Flacco could actually make a lot of sense as a replacement.\n\nCarolina Panthers predicted to land top edge rusher in free agency\n\nBaltimore Ravens predicted to cut ties with All-Pro defender\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles predicted to make quarterback trade over offseason\n\nPittsburgh Steelers urged to avoid veteran quarterback in free agency",

    "fullText": "Trinity Rodman has been called a generational talent. Not necessarily because she is the best in the world — three-time Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmati is still at the top of that list — but because of what she offers as a whole.\n\nFrom her signature, defense-splitting “Trin Spin” move on the field to her entertaining and profitable presence off it, keeping Rodman in the National Women’s Soccer League was so crucial to the current trajectory of women’s soccer in America that the league changed its rules to ensure it happened.\n\nThe reality is that Rodman could have walked away. The 23-year-old’s previous contract with the Washington Spirit ended on Dec. 31. She had options from Europe, including from Chelsea, which has been willing to splash some cash on U.S. players. But she stuck it out with her team and her city, even after a previous agreement vetoed by the league sparked arguments about the NWSL’s salary-cap rules.\n\nRodman was rewarded for that loyalty with one of the biggest salaries in women’s soccer history. She will take home more than $2 million a year for the next three years, benefitting from a change in league rules to allow such spending.\n\n“Getting drafted here and developing and maturing and learning and failing at Spirit and in D.C., it’s become so much of my legacy and my story. But on top of that, I still feel like there’s so much more I have to give and so much more that I want to do,” Rodman said during her contract signing ceremony on Thursday.\n\nMany will claim credit for finally ending the mind-boggling saga around keeping the superstar in the league, but the rich soccer community in Washington, D.C., should not go overlooked. Thursday was a welcome reminder of the anomaly that is women’s soccer, where the love of the game can still sometimes outweigh balance sheets.\n\nOwner Michele Kang’s willingness to pay a player what she’s worth and Rodman’s persistence in demanding nothing less were only successful when paired with the growing relationship between the team and its fans.\n\nTo understand how that connection became so strong — and how it might be emulated elsewhere — you have to go back to the beginning.\n\nThe Spirit selected Rodman No. 2 in the 2021 draft. At the time, Kang, who now owns professional women’s teams on three continents, was only a minority investor. While there was plenty of excitement around the young prospect, whose surname was already synonymous with championships in another sport thanks to her father, soccer took a backseat to off-field issues months ahead of the postseason.\n\nIn September 2021, the Spirit fired head coach Richie Burke following allegations of emotional and verbal harassment. Shortly after, the Spirit had to forfeit two games for violating the league’s COVID-19 policy. Majority owner Steve Baldwin, who was accused of allowing Burke to quietly step away rather than force a more public vetting of the allegations surrounding his coach, battled with Kang for control of the team. Kang called for Baldwin to step down and sell his shares to her.\n\nWithout protection from the front office, the drama seeped into the players’ day-to-day work, and they eventually called for Baldwin to sell his stake in the team to Kang. Following the COVID forfeits, the team lost just twice in the last 13 games and won the club’s first NWSL Championship. Rodman, for her part, won rookie of the year.\n\nBaldwin eventually agreed to sell for $35 million, more than seven times the team’s valuation at the time. However, it wasn’t until March 30, 2022, that Kang was finally able to gain control of the club.\n\nLeaders such as midfielder Andi Sullivan and goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury, who consistently fielded questions about the off-field obstacles, are still key parts of the team’s leadership in 2026. That matters. The fans who stuck by the players matter, too.\n\nThe Spirit’s home, Audi Field, has earned the name “Rowdy Audi” after three seasons of record attendance, which reached an average of 10,866 in 2023, 13,940 in 2024 and 15,110 in 2025. With sellouts becoming commonplace, it’s easy to forget that before 2023, the Spirit spent many home games at small venues more than an hour outside the city, sometimes with less than 10,000-seat capacity.\n\n“The fan base, the stadium, you can’t (compare) — even other NWSL teams (don’t) get these amount of fans,” Rodman said. “I feel it, and you see it with all the interactions I have. I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”\n\nIn 2021, the players rallied around each other, and the fans rallied around the players. In 2025, that support has grown by the thousands. Rodman is without a doubt part of that growth, and she bears that responsibility openly.\n\nAfter the Spirit defeated Racing Louisville in the 2025 NWSL quarterfinals, Rodman sprinted to the wall of supporters to celebrate. It had been her first game back since a minor MCL sprain kept her out of the previous playoff match and regular-season finale. Likely to the dismay of a nearby athletic trainer, Rodman hopped into the stands alongside teammate Esme Morgan and waved the supporters’ massive flag to erupting cheers. She made a similar show of respect after the team’s semifinal win over the Portland Thorns, their final home game of the season. The win helped Washington reach its second final in as many years.\n\nThat moment illustrated the importance of the community the Spirit have created.\n\nFive years ago, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe were the names synonymous with soccer in America and women’s soccer as a whole. Now, Rodman has taken that crown, even if she spent much of last year sidelined by injuries. In all, she played 17 games and scored five goals. Yet when she came on the field in the NWSL Championship, PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. reached its loudest decibel level of the night.\n\nThe 23-year-old Olympic gold medalist has endured seven club coaches, multiple home venues and new ownership. Throughout it all, she’s helped build a soccer power.\n\nKang and other team executives made clear last Thursday how much those fans matter. They brought up an elementary school student and Spirit supporter named Emma to deliver Rodman’s new contract. Rodman embraced Emma — and her pink box braids that mirrored Rodman’s iconic look from the 2024 Olympics — and talked about how she wants to use her extended time with the Spirit to give back to the youth in D.C.\n\nCynically, it could be seen as a marketing move to sell more tickets. With private equity and skyrocketing valuations becoming a bigger part of the women’s game, not every gesture can be taken at face value. Kang, who owns London City Lioness in England and OL Lyonnes in France, is among the owners whose motives have been questioned. Women’s soccer has gone overlooked and mistreated for so long that scar tissue remains.\n\nHowever, Thursday showed what happens when the community aspect of women’s soccer is not just embraced, but invested in.\n\n“I can’t think about the Washington Spirit without her,” Kang said. “I hope she can’t think about her career without Washington Spirit.”\n\nRodman could have walked away. Instead, she made it abundantly clear that she wanted to stay, for the team, the fans and herself.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nUS Women's national team, Washington Spirit, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "Brown's round, which included one eagle and 10 birdies, tied the course record but his putt for a coveted 59 went right of the hole.",
    "fullText": "LA QUINTA, CA — All the talk of playing in the Bahamas and private flights across the country and late-night fast-food runs faded under the brilliance of a Southern California day and the talent of Blades Brown on Friday, Jan. 23.\n\nBrown, who made his professional debut at 17 years old last year at The American Express, fired a 12-under 60 on the Nicklaus Tournament Course at PGA West in the second round of the PGA Tour event at the La Quinta Country Club. It was the lowest round in the PGA Tour by an 18-year-old since 1983.\n\nBrown, seeking an historic 59, parred the final three holes including a 7-foot putt on his final hole that rolled agonizingly wide right.\n\n\"I saw my spot just a little before the hole. I got a great read off David Ford,\" Brown said of his final putt for 59. \"He dripped it in there and it went right dead center. So I was thinking, okay, maybe just a little outside right edge. Unfortunately, it didn't break, but it's all right. I'm not worried about it.\"\n\nAs he watched his putt sail right, Brown looked to the heavens in disappointment as a large gallery groaned, obviously aware of the moment and wanting to be a part of history. But the smile returned to his face moments later after tapping in his par, for a course record and stamping himself as a rising star in the sport.\n\nLEADERBOARD: Full results from The American Express\n\n\"I just really like this golf course. There's something about the Nicklaus Course that I just really like,\" said Brown, who shot 64 on the course in 2025 including a run of six consecutive birdies. \"Like, it's so money. It's so pure. Everything is just perfectly well-kempt. I love playing with no wind. So when you put all those things together it's fun.\"\n\nHe was bidding for the 16th sub-60 round in PGA Tour history and the third ever shot at the desert's PGA event.\n\nBrown, a member of the Korn Ferry Tour and in the field this week on a sponsor's exemption, shares the 36-hole lead in the tournament at 17-under, with world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. Scheffler, playing four groups ahead of Brown, fired a 64 on the Nicklaus course. Si Woo Kim fired a 65 on the Pete Dye Stadium Course, the toughest of the three courses in the rotation, and is alone in third at 16 under.\n\nBrown wasn't the only player to make it to the 18th hole with a shot at a 59 on Friday. Andrew Putnam, playing at La Quinta Country Club, had a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole, but missed and had to settle for a fantastic 12-under 60 to tie the course record.\n\nBrown began his day on the 10th hole at the Nicklaus course and birdied the first hole, followed by an eagle on the par-5 11th. Brown then made five consecutive birdies to reach 8 under through seven holes before making three consecutive pars.\n\nBut starting on the second hole on the front nine (his back), Brown regained his torrid scoring touch, with four birdies in his next five holes to get to 12 under for the day. He managed just a par on the par-5 seventh hole, then missed makeable birdie putts on the eighth and ninth hole which would've given him a magical 59.\n\nBrown or Putnam would've been the third golfer shoot 59 at The American Express. David Duval shot the number in the final round of the 1999 tournament on the Palmer Course at PGA West to win the tournament. Adam Hadwin shot 59 in the third round of the 2017 event at La Quinta Country Club, but Hadwin ended up second that week behind Hudson Swafford.\n\nBrown's fantastic round comes just two days after he finish play in the Korn Ferry Tour event in the Bahamas, where Brown finished tied for 17th. Brown took a private jet for six hours to get to the Southern California desert late Wednesday night, hit fast-foot restaurant Panda Express, went to a grocery store and then went to sleep before his 9:58 a.m. tee time Thursday. Brown shot 5-under 67 at La Quinta Country Club to open the event.\n\nPutnam's round at La Quinta Country Clubs starter slower than Brown's with just one birdie in his first three holes. But Putnam, 36 and with one PGA Tour victory, rattled off six consecutive birdies and capped that run with an eagle on the par-5 11th to get to 9-under for the day. He added two birdies at 13 and 14 and another at 17 to reach 12 under before making the long two-putt for a par on the 18th hole.\n\nThe 60 moved Putnam to 12 under for the tournament, tied for 18th in a week where low scoring seems to be at a record pace. The two 60s even overshadowed Scheffler, the No. 1 player in the world who cruised to a 64 for his second consecutive bogey-free round in his first tournament of the year. One of the players to have shot 59 in an event back in 2020, Scheffler said he wouldn't have been too surprised had the day produced two 59s.\n\n\"The courses are in good shape, you've got good weather conditions, I think that's a recipe for some low scores when you got guys with the amount of talent that we have out here on tour,\" Scheffler said. \"I think when you get those two things together you're going to see some low scores.\"\n\nBoth Scheffler and Brown will move to the Stadium Course for the third round Saturday. Brown was in contention to make the cut in the 2025 American Express but a third-round 74 on the Stadium Course moved him outside of the cut line in his pro debut.\n\n\"(Saturday) obviously the Stadium Course is the more difficult of the three golf courses,\" Brown said. \"I haven't played it yet (this year), so I'm just going to go see where I can hit it down the fairway, hit it on the green, and try to make a putt.\"\n\nThe idea of a Sunday final group including Scheffler and Brown is tantalizing. Scheffler says he only knows a little bit of Brown's story and does not know Brown personally.\n\n\"These kids coming out, they know they got to come out and make some birdies. I think when you're coming out young you don't have as much scar tissue as the guys that are a little bit more seasoned, and you just come out, and if you want to make a name for yourself you got to put up some good scores,\" Scheffler said. \"It sounds like an 18-year-old shooting 59 is a pretty good start to his career there.\"\n\nBrown said he'd love the chance to play with the world's No. 1.\n\n\"I think that would be awesome, yeah. Scottie is an unbelievable golfer,\" Brown said. \"I'd try to learn from him as much as I can the way he plays the golf course. There's a lot of strategy in his game, and he's obviously an unbelievable ball-striker. So it's really cool watching him play some golf.\"\n\nJake Knapp (59): 2025 Cognizant Classic (Round 1)\n\nHayden Springs (59): 2024 John Deere Classic (Round 1)\n\nCameron Young (59): 2024 Travelers Championship (Round 3)\n\nScottie Scheffler (59): 2020 The Northern Trust (Round 2)\n\nKevin Chappell (59): 2019 Military Tribute at the Greenbrier (Round 2)\n\nBrandt Snedeker (59): 2018 Wyndam Championship (Round 1)\n\nAdam Hadwin (59): 2017 Career Builder Challenge (Round 3)\n\nJustin Thomas (59): 2017 Sony Open (Round 1)\n\nJim Furyk (58): 2016 Travelers Championship (Round 2)\n\nJim Furyk (59): 2013 BMW Championship (Round 2)\n\nStuart Appleby (59): 2010 Greenbrier Classic (Round 4)\n\nPaul Goydos (59): 2010 John Deere Classic (Round 1)\n\nDavid Duval (59): 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic (Round 4)\n\nChip Beck (59): 1991 Las Vegas Invitational (Round 3)\n\nAl Geiberger (59): 1977 Memphis Classic (Round 2)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Springs Desert Sun: Blades Brown shoots 60 in Round 2 of American Express PGA Tour event",

    "description": "“What hormones people have in their bodies play a very small part in what they are able to do athletically,\" the Heated Rivalry star told PRIDE.",
    "fullText": "It turns out trans student athletes aren’t the only ones who are having to contend with politicians keeping them from playing sports, now adult trans hockey players are facing challenges too.\n\nHarrison Browne, who starred in Heated Rivalry and was the first openly transgender pro hockey player, is speaking out against USA Hockey’s new eligibility policy, which doesn’t outright ban trans athletes, but makes it almost impossible for them to compete even in recreational leagues.\n\nBack in November, USA Hockey, the national governing body for hockey, which oversees the U.S. participation in the Olympics, quietly released a new Participant Eligibility Policy, but when Browne found out about it yesterday, he immediately took to Instagram to alert his followers to the updated anti-trans rules.\n\n“USA Hockey is basically telling me I can’t play in a recreational league with friends that I played my entire career with,” Browne told PRIDE. “I just think that’s crazy.\"\n\nThe new policy, which updates what previously was a much more inclusive version from 2019, will put strict rules on who can play in youth, junior, disabled, and adult hockey leagues when it goes into effect on April 1, 2026. According to the updated policy, trans athletes can still play in co-ed leagues, but they are restricted to their sex assigned at birth when it comes to sex-exclusive leagues.\n\n“In all programs where participation is restricted by sex, athletes are only permitted to participate in such programs based on their sex assigned at birth, except that a female (as assigned at birth) may not play in programs restricted to females if they have undergone any male hormone therapy,” the policy reads.\n\nThis means that trans women would be forced to play in men’s leagues, and trans men would have to play in women’s leagues unless they take testosterone, in which case they wouldn’t be allowed in either space.\n\n“The safest spaces I’ve found are queer spaces, are women’s spaces,” Browne said, explaining that forcing trans women to play in men’s leagues wouldn’t be safe because they are still plagued by “homophobia and transphobic language, whether that’s on the ice or behind closed doors in the locker room.”\n\nWhile not an outright ban, this new policy will make it nearly impossible for trans hockey players to play in any league overseen by USA Hockey, which includes less competitive recreational leagues, often called “beer leagues” by players.\n\nWomen’s hockey leagues across the country are having to deal with the new policy, with some taking to social media to assure players that they are looking into what it will mean for them. The Seattle Women’s Hockey Club wrote on Instagram, “To our trans members: it is the board's firm belief that our community is better for having you in it. Hockey belongs to anyone who has ever picked up a stick or cheered on their team, and that includes you, regardless of what USA Hockey says.”\n\nBrowne places the blame for this shift from a fairly inclusive trans participation policy to one that, in practice, will likely keep many trans athletes from playing hockey squarely on President Donald Trump’s shoulders. “We can’t overlook the fact that the [Trump] Administration is putting a lot of pressure on sports organizations to make a stance against trans participation in sports,” he said.\n\nRepublicans frequently claim that their focus on trans women in sports is because they care about fairness, but the argument is specious and ignores the larger issues in the sport, Browne said.\n\n“Transgender women, transgender people are not the issue here,” he said. “It is socioeconomic status, it’s access. If you have access to better coaching, if you have access to better facilities, better equipment, better nutrition, you are automatically going to be a better athlete. What hormones people have in their bodies play a very small part in what they are able to do athletically.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: 'Heated Rivalry's Harrison Browne says new anti-trans hockey policy is 'crazy' and blames Trump\n\nSo you finished 'Heated Rivalry': Here are 2 ways to get into hockey\n\n7 gayest moments from the Professional Women's Hockey League in 2025 (so far)\n\n5 times athletes lived out the plot of 'Heated Rivalry' in real life",

    "fullText": "Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding, an alleged drug kingpin who's been accused of orchestrating multiple murders, was arrested in Mexico and taken to the United States, Justice Department officials announced Friday.\n\nWedding, a 44-year-old Canadian national, was taken into custody in Mexico City on Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel said at a news conference at Southern California's Ontario International Airport east of Los Angeles. During the news conference, Patel gestured to a plane behind him and told reporters Wedding had been taken off the plane.\n\nAn FBI official in Los Angeles told CBS News the U.S. government plane carrying Wedding landed at the airport from Mexico at approximately 8 a.m. local time Friday.\n\nIn a video clip provided by the FBI, a handcuffed Wedding is seen wearing jeans, sneakers, a sweatshirt, a vest and a baseball cap walking down a stairway from the plane flanked by FBI agents. Another clip shows Wedding and authorities walking away from the plane.\n\n\"Just to tell you how bad of a guy Ryan Wedding is, he went from an Olympic snowboarder to the largest narco-trafficker in modern times,\" Patel said. \"He is a modern-day 'El Chapo,' he is a modern-day Pablo Escobar, and he thought he could evade justice.\"\n\n\"El Chapo\" is an alias for Joaquin Guzman, a onetime leader of the notorious Mexican drug ring known as the Sinaloa Cartel who is serving a life sentence in the U.S. According to the FBI, Wedding also used aliases, including \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant\" and \"Public Enemy.\"\n\nPatel also said another fugitive who was arrested in Mexico last week, Alejandro Rosales Castillo, was brought to the U.S. on the same plane as Wedding and would be taken east later Friday. Patel said Castillo's arrest wasn't related to Wedding's apprehension.\n\nPatel told reporters he was in Mexico on a previously planned trip. He said the Mexican government worked with the U.S. to apprehend Wedding.\n\n\"This was a great operation that came together through interagency success,\" Patel said.\n\nPatel said he wouldn't provide additional details about Wedding's arrest \"to safeguard the integrity of the ongoing investigation.\" He declined to comment on the $15 million reward that was being offered by the U.S. for Wedding.\n\nWhen officials increased the reward in November, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi described Wedding's alleged operation as \"one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations in this world.\"\n\nThe Justice Department said it expects Wedding's arraignment to take place on Monday afternoon in Los Angeles.\n\nAkil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said investigators worked for over a year to arrest Wedding. \"Ryan Wedding tormented several people and several families that will never be the same, but today, they get the justice that they sought,\" Davis said.\n\nWedding, who competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, has been accused of running a major drug trafficking network that moved cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the U.S. and Canada. Patel said in a social media post Friday that Wedding was running his alleged operation as a member of the Sinaloa Cartel, and that Wedding was believed to have been hiding out in Mexico for over a decade.\n\nWedding was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list last year.\n\nIn November, Wedding was accused of placing a \"multimillion-dollar bounty\" on a federal witness who was involved in a narcotics case against him.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Wedding and his second-in-command Andrew Clark, 34, allegedly also ordered the killings of two members of a Canadian family in 2023 in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment.\n\nClark was extradited to the U.S. from Mexico last year.\n\nThe pair are also accused of directing the killing of another person in 2024 over a drug debt, according to the FBI.\n\nArkansas mayor on pivoting for ice storm as weather conditions worsen\n\nPennsylvania Gov.

    "fullText": "Aaron Glenn is searching for a new defensive coordinator for his second season with the Jets. Here's the latest on that search...\n\nThe Jets are moving on from a number of coaches, including QB coach Charles London, DL coach Eric Washington, LB coach Aaron Curry and pass game coordinator Scott Turner.\n\nSNY's Connor Hughes said on the latest episode of Jets Final Drive that players had \"a lot\" of issues with Washington and Curry, but Turner being relieved comes as a surprise.\n\nWith the mid-season release of DC Steve Wilks, Jets coach Aaron Glenn has now relieved five coaches of their duties.\n\nThe Jets were busy in the second week of their offseason, completing a first round of interviews for eight candidates for the vacant DC job.\n\nThe team announced that they completed virtual interviews with Wink Martindale, Jim Leonhard, Chris Harris, Jim O'Neil, DeMarcus Covington, Daronte Jones, Mathieu Araujo, and Ephraim Banda.\n\nMartindale is the most senior of the group at 65 years old and has the most experience as a defensive coordinator at the NFL level. Recently, the DC at Michigan, he worked last in the NFL with the Giants, where he had a rocky relationship with then-head coach Brian Daboll. Martindale also held the DC job for four seasons in Baltimore and one in Denver.\n\nLeonhard started 40 games over three seasons as a safety for the Jets. After finishing a 10-year playing career, he entered coaching, spending several years at his alma mater, Wisconsin. He was the DC with the Badgers from 2017-22, finishing as the interim head coach for the last seven games. He made the jump to the NFL in 2024 with another of his former teams, the Broncos, where he's been a defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator for the past two seasons, adding assistant head coach to his title this year.\n\nHarris was hired to Glenn's staff last offseason to be the defensive back coach and passing game coordinator, but finished as interim DC after Steve Wilks' firing. Before coming to New York, the eight-year NFL veteran was Washington's defensive backs coach (2020-22) and Tennessee's DBs coach and passing game coordinator (2023-24).\n\nO'Neil has experience with Glenn in Detroit, where he's worked as a defensive assistant since 2024. He got his first NFL gig with the Jets in 2009 as a defensive quality control coach before serving as assistant DBs coach from 2010-12. He was Cleveland's defensive coordinator for two seasons (2014-15), along with NFL stops in Buffalo (2013), San Francisco (2016), Oakland/Las Vegas (2019-20).\n\nCovington also has experience working as a DC in the NFL, holding that position with New England during the 2024 season. He first joined the Patriots under Bill Belichick, serving as a coaching assistant, outside linebackers coach, and defensive line coach after joining in 2016. He served as defensive line coach/run game coordinator with Green Bay in 2025.\n\nJones was the passing game coordinator and defensive backs coach with the Vikings. He first came to Minnesota in 2020, leaving for one season to be LSU's defensive coordinator in 2021.\n\nAraujo spent the past four seasons, his first in the pro ranks as a coach, with Miami coaching defensive backs.\n\nBanda has been the Browns' safeties coach since 2023 after spending several years coaching in college, including a stint as the DC at Utah State (2021-22).",

    "fullText": "Cristian Chivu experienced a night of mixed emotions at San Siro, but one that ultimately ended in celebration as Inter Milan stormed back to beat Pisa 6-2 and strengthen their grip on top spot.\n\nSpeaking to DAZN after the match, the Inter head coach reflected on a chaotic evening, took responsibility for key moments, and praised the mentality of his squad, particularly young striker Francesco Pio Esposito.\n\nAsked about Federico Dimarco’s introduction and the dramatic shift in momentum, Chivu stressed that belief never dropped.\n\n“I didn’t think anything special,” he explained, with quotes via FCInterNews.\n\n“A match lasts 100 minutes and you can turn it around. You have to keep doing certain things. The approach wasn’t bad, then we scored against ourselves, but that’s my fault because I make specific demands of the goalkeeper role that put Yann in difficulty. The goal is my fault, not his.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – DECEMBER 06: Cristian Chivu, Head Coach of FC Internazionale Milano, looks on prior to the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and Como 1907 at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on December 06, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nChivu also addressed Pisa’s second goal, pointing to their physical qualities.\n\n“Then the second goal came. Pisa have players with structure and they delivered the corner well,” he said. “After that, we brought out our pride, pushed the intensity, and turned it around before half-time.”\n\nThe Inter coach then focused on the collective response, especially from players introduced from the bench.\n\n“What matters is attitude and mental preparation,” Chivu said.\n\n“You know you can suffer at times. You have to be responsible for how you behave and how you react. Today we did that well despite the difficulties. We could have suffered mentally, but the team kept doing what it knows how to do.”\n\nHe also highlighted the effort shown across the group.\n\n“Maybe there’s some regret about conceding the 4-2 late on, but hats off to these lads. They give everything they have to make this season competitive and reach our objectives.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 14: Francesco Pio Esposito of FC Internazionale Milano celebrates scoring his team’s first goal with his Head Coach, Cristian Chivu, during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and US Lecce at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 14, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nChivu even found room for humour when asked about his back pain after the decisive fourth goal.\n\n“I filled myself with cortisone,” he joked. “Tomorrow I have to spend the day with my children and my wife. They want me fresh so I can be a good husband and a good father.”\n\nMuch of the post-match focus centred on Pio Esposito, whose performances continue to grow. Chivu made it clear where the credit lies.\n\n“The credit is theirs, in how they work and make themselves available to the group,” he said. “They know that every mistake they make is my fault, while they are the protagonists when things go well because they try to meet my demands.”\n\nHe praised Esposito’s mindset in particular.\n\n“It’s the merit of a boy who wants to prove himself, who wants to put himself on the line and take responsibility like everyone else. If things don’t go well, it’s my fault. But I like that they follow me and want to make this season what we all hope it can be.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 09: Cristian Chivu, Head Coach of Internazionale, looks on prior to the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SS Lazio at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on November 09, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nChivu also brushed aside questions about watching rival fixtures.\n\n“This question again…” he smiled. “I have a passion for football that goes beyond what people think. I watch a lot of matches, but tomorrow the priority is family. Recently I’ve been absent because I think too much about these wonderful lads and forget my duty as a good husband and father. Sometimes you can’t think only about football.”\n\nSpeaking separately to Inter TV, Chivu returned to the themes of maturity and growth.\n\n“We approached the match in the right way, then the opponents came into it and we made some mistakes,” he said, with quotes again courtesy of FCInterNews.\n\n“We did well to stay clear-headed. That comes from confidence. In the second half maybe we could have killed it earlier given the chances we created, but we take the three points.”\n\nHe underlined the significance of the comeback.\n\n“For the first time this season, the team overturned a double deficit. That has to be highlighted. The growth we’ve shown over the last month and a half paid off in the end.”\n\nFinally, Chivu summed up the mentality he sees within his squad. “This is a mature team that knows there are moments you have to overcome,” he concluded.\n\n“You have to act according to the phase of the game. When you take two slaps like that, you don’t know how you’ll react, but this group knows the difficulties. My demands are always very high. You shouldn’t point fingers at individual performances. I am responsible and I put my face to it. The lads work well, and you can see it.”\n\nInter’s six-goal response may have stolen the headlines, but Chivu’s words revealed a deeper satisfaction.\n\nBeyond the scoreline, he saw proof of belief, accountability and a young striker determined to prove himself at the highest level.",

    "description": "According to the rumor, the NFL's 2025 Super Bowl MVP donated $300,000 of his own money as a way of kick-starting the special fund.",
    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund — in honor of the woman fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis in January 2026 —and contributed $300,000.\n\nIn January 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund. Users' posts claimed the NFL's Super Bowl LIX MVP kickstarted the fund himself, contributing $300,000 of his own money.\n\nThe purported scholarship fund referenced Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident shot fatally shot on Jan. 7 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross.\n\nFor example, on Jan. 20, a user managing the NFL Pulse Facebook page posted (archived) an image collage of three pictures allegedly showing Hurts hugging Good's 6-year-old son on a football field, Good holding her son in front of a body of water and Hurts walking inside a football stadium. The post's text claimed Good's killing inspired Hurts to launch the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, including the $300,000 contribution.\n\nIn short, the rumor was false. One or more users fabricated and promoted the claim with the help of images and text generated with artificial-intelligence tools.\n\nSnopes contacted a manager of the NFL Pulse Facebook page to ask about the fictional stories and AI-generated content displayed on the feed, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles to request an official statement, and will update this story if we receive more information.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post (archived) — as well as other Facebook posts sharing the same rumor — featured links leading to advertisement-filled articles hosted on WordPress blogs. The users owning those blogs earned revenue based on the combination of advertising and made-up stories. The NFL Pulse post redirected to an article on on such untrustworthy website.\n\nSearches of Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google found no news media outlets reporting about Hurts establishing a scholarship fund in Good's name. A Yahoo search did, however, mistakenly produce an AI-generated answer wrongly confirming the rumor as true. Outlets would have widely reported on the story involving Hurts and Good, had it truly occurred.\n\nRegarding the fake, AI-generated photo of Hurts holding Good's son, the most evident sign of AI — aside from the misspelling of \"Eagles\" as \"Eaglees\" — was the reality that sports and standard news outlets would have very widely publicized the moment, had the meeting between the quarterback and young boy truly taken place.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post's text, presented in its entirety later in this article, featured over-dramatic wording common with AI tools. For example, one part of the post read, \"This was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\" Additionally, the idea that individuals or teams aiming to rapidly produce inauthentic content for ad revenue would carefully, slowly and manually write text for their articles simply does not square with reality.\n\nThe person or people who authored the story about Hurts and Good fabricated the entire claim as one of hundreds of inspirational tales that depicted celebrities and athletes performing inspiring acts of kindness. Such stories resemble glurge, which Dictionary.com defines as stories \"that are supposed to be true and uplifting, but which are often fabricated and sentimental.\"\n\nFor readers interested in the story told in the NFL Pulse Facebook post, the post presented the made-up tale as follows:\n\nJalen Hurts has officially established The Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, personally committing an initial $300,000 donation to honor the life of Renee Nicole Good — a mother whose story ended in tragedy after she was killed in Minneapolis, a loss that left an entire community grieving.\n\nBut this gesture goes far beyond a financial contribution.\n\nJalen Hurts founded the scholarship fund himself to ensure that Renee's 6-year-old son will receive full educational support from elementary school through college — including tuition, books, tutoring, and opportunities for personal development. Alongside the financial commitment, Jalen also dedicated his voice, his platform, and his heart to a child now facing a world without his mother.\n\nThis was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\n\nAcross the nation, many were moved not by the amount of money pledged, but by the meaning behind Jalen's decision: a promise that Renee Nicole Good's life mattered, and that her son's future will be protected, supported, and filled with hope.\n\nFor further reading, we previously reported about the time tech billionaire Elon Musk deleted a post supporting the Eagles supporting the Eagles after they lost the 2023 Super Bowl LVII.\n\n\"GLURGE Definition & Meaning.\" Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/glurge.\n\nHuberman, Bond, and David Emery. \"Snopestionary: What Does 'Glurge' Mean?\" Snopes, 21 Aug. 2021, https://www.snopes.com//articles/363643/what-does-glurge-mean/.",

    "fullText": "Inter coach Cristian Chivu is impressed by players’ reaction in a 6-2 win over Pisa and defends Yann Sommer after the Swiss keeper gave away the opening goal: ‘It’s my fault.’\n\nInter came back from two goals down in a home game against Pisa on Friday. The Serie A giants completed the comeback even before the half-time break and then scored three \n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 14: Cristian Chivu, Head Coach of FC Internazionale Milano, reacts during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and US Lecce at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 14, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nA turning point in the game came at minute 34 when Chivu replaced Luis Henrique with Federico Dimarco. The Italian was the Man of the Match, scoring one goal and providing one assist.\n\n“A match lasts 100 minutes, and it can be turned around,” Chivu told DAZN via FCInter1908.\n\nPisa striker Stefano Moreo scored the opening goal with a 30-yard lob, but Sommer gave the ball away outside the box, in an attempt to build up from the back.\n\n“That was my fault because I’m the one who makes certain requests to the goalkeeper. Sometimes I put Yann in difficulty,” Chivu said.\n\n“Then they scored from a set piece. After that, we showed pride and kept pushing with quality and intensity, and we turned it around.\n\n“The attitude is what matters; you might suffer at times, but what counts is how you react. I’d say we did very well,” Chivu continued.\n\n“We could have collapsed, but instead, the team kept doing their things. The only regret is that we didn’t make it 4-2 earlier, only at the end. But hats off to the boys, they give everything they have to make this a competitive season and to show that we’re working to reach our objectives.”\n\nInter came back from two goals down in a home Serie A clash against Pisa, completing a comeback with Piotr Zielinski, Lautaro Martinez and Francesco Pio Esposito in the opening Round 22 match.\n\nPio Esposito gave Inter the lead seconds before the break with his third Serie A goal this season.\n\n“He really wants to prove himself and put himself on the line. He takes responsibility, like all 25 of our players,” Chivu said.\n\n“And if things don’t go well, it will always be my fault because sometimes I push too hard. I’m happy they believe in our work.”\n\nChivu arrived late for his post-match interview as he required treatment from the Inter doctors.\n\n“I’ve filled myself with painkillers for my back,” he revealed.\n\n“Tomorrow, my kids want me fresh, and my wife expects it too. I have to be ready to be a good husband and a good father.”\n\nDoes this mean he won’t watch Juventus-Napoli and Roma-Milan on Sunday?\n\n“That question again…I have a passion for football that goes beyond my job. Sometimes I’m tired because I watch so many matches, but I know you have to watch them to learn,” Chivu concluded.\n\n“If I get the chance to watch them, I will, but my family is the priority because I devote too much time to these fantastic boys and often neglect my duty as a husband and father. And since they deserve it, sometimes, you have to switch off and not think too much about football. Family always comes first.”",

    "fullText": "The bad news is piling up in the Ezeiza offices. After the definitive collapse of negotiations for Alexis Cuello, Boca Juniors has received another \"no,\" this time from Brazil. Fluminense officially rejected the $5 million offer presented by the La Ribera club to acquire the services of Kevin Serna.\n\nThe Colombian forward, who is under contract with the \"Flu\" until December 2027, was declared non-transferable by the Carioca management, which considers the offer insufficient and prioritizes maintaining their structure for the 2026 season. With this rejection, Juan Román Riquelme loses his second priority option to strengthen the wing in less than 24 hours.\n\nWith the refusals for Serna and Cuello, Boca's offensive outlook now depends on parallel negotiations that must be accelerated. The only name that seems to be \"close\" is Ángel Romero, who would arrive as a free agent. However, the Football Council — now under the structure of Marcelo Delgado as manager — is already considering other emergency names.\n\nAmong the alternatives gaining momentum are Rodrigo Auzmendi (Banfield) and the return of inquiries for Chimy Ávila. Meanwhile, the pressure is on to secure at least one significant forward before the debut in the Torneo Apertura, considering that Claudio Úbeda's squad is facing significant injuries in the forward line.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

However, Atlético Nacional stepped in to dispel the rumors, denying that the midfielder had requested permission to train at the club's High Performance Center in Guarne.\n\nAlthough the \"number 10\" is currently in the capital of Antioquia doing individual training, the \"Verdolaga\" management was emphatic in stating that there has been no formal contact from the player. According to local reports, the club has not received any requests to use its facilities, and James continues his preparation on his own while waiting for a concrete offer.\n\nIn addition to clarifying the training issue, Atlético Nacional has definitively closed the door on a possible signing of James for the 2026 season. The club's reasons are strictly strategic and financial.\n\nWith Nacional out of the picture and Millonarios analyzing the viability of the \"The Last Dance\" plan, James is still racing against the clock to find a team and arrive in competitive shape for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "At long last Zuffa Boxing is set to kick off its debut event later TONIGHT (Fri., Jan. 23, 2026) as Zuffa Boxing 1 is set to go down inside Meta’s Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada. Headlining the event — which will streaming live on Paramount+ — will be a Middleweight showdown between Irish sensation, Callum Walsh, taking on Carlos Ocampo.\n\nWalsh was Dana White’s first-ever signing to his upstart boxing promotion, so it makes sense to have him kickoff the debut event. “King” is undefeated (15-0) with 11 knockouts and is coming off a unanimous decision win over Fernando Vargas Jr. on the “Canelo vs. Crawford”-led undercard in Las Vegas, Nevada, back in Sept. 2025 (full results here). As for Ocampo, he is coming in with a record of 38-3 and is currently riding a three-fight win streak into a bout he hopes will give him the spotlight should he pull off the massive upset.\n\nIt’s an important night for White and Co. since the debut fight card to his boxing venture will either silence a lot of doubters (such as this one), or give them more fuel to spit verbal venom at him for trying to change things up to a combat sport that has marched to the beat of the same drum for decades.\n\nWe don’t expect it to be perfect, but all eyes will be on this event.\n\nMany readers check in before, during and after the fights to share their thoughts on all of the action, as the card kicks off at 6 p.m. ET on Paramount+. Feel free to leave a comment (or several) about the bouts and chat with all the other Maniacs during the show — it’s always a lot of fun!\n\n160 lbs: Callum Walsh vs. Carlos Ocampo\n160 lbs: Misael Rodriguez Olivas vs. Austin Deanda\n147 lbs: Julian Rodriguez vs. Cain Sandoval \n126 lbs: Omar Trinidad vs. Max Ornelas \n118 lbs: Floyd Diaz vs. Guillermo Gutierrez \n118lbs: Emiliano Cardenas vs. Marcus Cortez Harris – Cardenas via unanimous decision\n135 lbs: Robert Meriwether III vs. Cesar Correa – Merriwether III via unanimous decision\n135 lbs: Troy Nash vs. Jacob Ramos – Nash via unanimous decision\n\nWe've got some ACTION at #ZuffaBoxing01💥#RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/9K4xHMg5Lc\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026\n\nOPENING UP THE FIRST ZUFFA BOXING CARD EVER‼️\n\n🇺🇸 @RealTroyNash v Jaycob Ramos 🇺🇸\n\nLIVE on @ParamountPlus | #RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/JdiFSpLuoQ\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026\n\nIT'S ALMOST TIME 🥊#ZuffaBoxing01 kicks off at the top of the hour!\n\nWatch here: https://t.co/bgoL7klXvE | #RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/2Sd0KqPKEJ\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026",

    "title": "Five Ways People Are Using Claude Code",
    "description": "Claude Code generates computer code when people type prompts, so those with no coding experience can create their own programs and apps.",
    "fullText": "Claude Code, an artificial intelligence tool that can generate computer code when people type a prompt, is having a viral moment.\n\nThe tool, which the A.I. start-up Anthropic introduced in May, has shown record growth over the past two weeks, the company said, without sharing its data. People had time to experiment with Claude Code over the holidays, Anthropic said, and users realized how capable it was.\n\nClaude Code is one of several A.I. coding tools — which also include Base44 and Cursor — that people with no coding experience are increasingly using to build their own websites, programs and apps, a trend known as “vibecoding.” People pay a subscription fee of $20 to $200 a month to use Claude Code, depending on the features they want.\n\nHere are five ways that people are using Claude Code:\n\nMr. Hindes, an assistant principal at a school for autistic children, has four children under the age of 9 and turned to A.I. to help him organize his family’s laundry.\n\nLast week, he prompted Claude Code to make a program to identify which clothes belonged to each of his three daughters so he could sort clean laundry into piles without their help. He took pictures of their clothes to teach Claude Code which T-shirt belonged to which daughter. Now he simply holds up the clothes to his laptop camera so the program tells him whom it belongs to.\n\n“The whole process was done within an hour, and the girls were really excited,” he said.\n\nMr. Hindes said he was now building a program with Claude Code to help his daughters independently work though the steps of their morning routine, as if playing a game.\n\n“I’ve tried to teach myself coding at various points but never stuck with it,” he said.\n\nMr. Stephenson, an art and architecture photographer, started using Claude Code in November to build a website about a documentary feature.\n\nThe website was created in about a day, he said, with an interactive map of New York City that captured his photos and audio recordings to document life in each borough.\n\n“Once the basic site was done, emboldened by my new capabilities, I started adding features I hadn’t even considered,” said Mr. Stephenson, who pays $20 a month for Claude Code. “Light/dark mode? Easy. Shuffle button? Done.”\n\nIf Claude Code could not solve a particular problem, he turned to Google’s A.I. chatbot, Gemini, to ask how it would approach the issue.\n\n“I’d envisioned something like this when I started a couple of years ago, but assumed it would cost thousands of dollars to build,” he said.\n\nMr. Roberts, an assistant prosecuting attorney, used Claude Code and Cursor in August to create a mobile app called AlertAssist, which lets users send a mass text to contacts in an emergency. Working in law enforcement got Mr. Roberts interested in trying to help people act quickly and safely in an emergency.\n\nThe design and user interface of the app are “very basic, but it works,” he said.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Haubo Dyhrberg, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Delaware, had an idea to make a stock trading simulator for her class. She consulted her husband, a software engineer, but “the task seemed too daunting.”\n\nOn Monday, she downloaded Claude Code and within two hours had a working demo of a trading simulator that her students could use to trade securities in a mock market. She has built five different trading scenarios for students to explore various challenges in financial markets.\n\n“I never thought it would be this easy,” she said. “I can’t wait to test it out when the semester starts in two weeks.”\n\nMr. Bacus, who owns a welding and metal fabrication business, tapped Claude Code last month to create an A.I. assistant to manage his calendar and find him new business opportunities. The business is just him and three others, so “we’re not in the place right now to afford an office team,” Mr. Bacus said. “It’s all on me.”\n\nWith Claude Code, he built a personal A.I. assistant that connects to his calendar, Google Sheets and Gmail account so he can easily create estimates, track the progress of jobs and organize contracts.\n\n“I’m a skilled laborer who barely passed high school in the early 2000s,” Mr. Bacus said, adding: “But over the past few months, I’ve taught myself to build actual tools for my business.”",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.\n\nScientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object’s path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.\n\nUsing this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly — crucial if the debris is dangerous.\n\n“The problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,” said Johns Hopkins University’s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. “But once it gets to the point that it’s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.”\n\nHis team’s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.\n\nA growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.\n\n“There are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,” including SpaceX’s Starlinks and other companies’ internet satellites, said Fernando. “Unfortunately, we don’t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.”\n\nFernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London’s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object’s suspected path.\n\nChina’s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country’s space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module — more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size — broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object’s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.\n\nFernando acknowledged it’s impossible to know how close his team’s predictions are to the actual path since no debris was reported on the ground.\n\nThe goal is to ascertain, within minutes or even seconds, the speed and direction of the incoming space junk as well as its fragmentation. In remote areas like the South Pacific, nuclear blast monitoring stations could potentially track the sonic booms to fine-tune the paths of descent. That’s where NASA plans to ditch the International Space Station in five years. SpaceX is working on the deorbiting vehicle to ensure a controlled entry.\n\nFernando is looking to eventually publish a catalog of seismically tracked, entering space objects, while improving future calculations by factoring in the wind’s effect on falling debris.\n\nIn a companion article in Science, Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Chris Carr, who was not involved in the study, said further research is needed to reduce the time between an object’s final plunge and the determination of its course.\n\nFor now, Carr said this new method “unlocks the rapid identification of debris fall-out zones, which is key information as Earth’s orbit is anticipated to become increasingly crowded with satellites, leading to a greater influx of space debris.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "description": "The High Court in New Delhi, India, has granted another pirate site blocking order in favor of American movie industry giants.",
    "fullText": "Pirate sites and services can be a real challenge for rightsholders to deal with. In India, however, recent court orders have proven to be quite effective.\n\nIndian courts have issued pirate site blocking orders for over a decade. Initially, these orders were relatively basic, requiring local Internet providers to block specific domain names.\n\nThese regular injunctions were only partially effective. After the High Court granted a blocking injunction, pirate sites would often switch to new domains, requiring rightsholders to return to court to get these blocked as well.\n\nTo deal with this problem, the dynamic injunction was invented. These orders were issued to more effectively deny access to content made available on pirate sites. ISPs were not only required to block original domains but also any clones and mirror sites that surfaced after the order was signed.\n\nWhen dynamic injunctions were no longer sufficient to slay the piracy hydra, rightsholders suggested upgrading the Indian blocking regime with Dynamic ++ injunctions. These orders also protect copyrighted content that has yet to be registered.\n\nIn addition, Dynamic++ orders and their ‘superlative‘ variant also include domain name registrars as defendants. This includes blocking orders targeted at U.S. domain registrars.\n\nThe ability to target domain name registrants proved to be a game changer. Over the past two years, it allowed rightsholders to disable domains of various prominent pirate sites, some with dozens of millions of visitors. While these sites could simply register new domains, the legal efforts certainly affected their operation.\n\nFor this reason, it is no surprise to see that several American movie industry players have ramped up their enforcement actions in India, targeting hundreds of domains at a time. And since these orders effectively suspend domains at various domain name registrars, new requests keep coming in.\n\nAs reported by Verdictum a few days ago, the High Court in New Delhi issued a new blocking injunction on December 18, targeting more than 150 pirate site domains, including yflix.to, animesuge.bz, bs.to, and many others.\n\nThe complaint is filed by Warner Bros., Apple, Crunchyroll, Disney, and Netflix, which are all connected to the MPA’s anti-piracy arm, ACE. The referenced works include some of the most pirated titles, such as Stranger Things, Squid Game, and Silo.\n\nIn addition to targeting Indian ISPs, the order also lists various domain name registries and related organizations as defendants. This includes American registrars such as Namecheap and GoDaddy, but also the government of the Kingdom of Tonga, which is linked to .to domains.\n\nIn addition to suspending the domain names within three days days, the domain name registrars are given four weeks to disclose the relevant subscriber information connected to these domains.\n\n“[The registrars] shall lock and suspend Defendant Nos. 1 to 47 websites within 72 hours of being communicated with a copy of this Order and shall file all the Basic Subscriber Information, including the name, address, contact information, email addresses, bank details, IP logs, and any other relevant information […] within four weeks of being communicated with a copy of this Order,” the High Court wrote.\n\nWhile the “Dynamic+” injunction is designed to be a global kill switch, its effectiveness depends entirely on the cooperation of the domain name registrars. Since most of these are based outside of India, their compliance is not guaranteed.\n\nAccording to our analysis, it appears that most domain names have not been suspended. These pirate sites domains continue to be accessible today. Some continue running from their original domains, while others redirect to new ones, suggesting that they remain controlling their original owners.\n\nThis includes domains that are linked to Namecheap, Tucows, GoDaddy, NameSilo, Dynadot, OVH and others. The government of the Kingdom of Tonga did not comply with the Indian court order either.\n\nAs far as we can see, domains linked to the American registrar Porkbun, the UK-based WHG Hosting services, and the Lithuanian registrar Hostinger were fully suspended. Registrar.eu also put some domains on clientHold, and the one that remains accessible (animesuge.bz) is linked to Namecheap now.\n\nIt’s not unprecedented for foreign companies, including American ones, not to comply with Indian court orders. However, in this case, it is worth noting that Namecheap previously appeared to comply with similar orders from the Delhi High Court.\n\nThe non-compliance must come as a disappointment to Netflix, Warner Bros. and the others. However, they will likely be back in court for more blocking and suspension orders soon enough.\n\nAll in all, it is clear that India’s High Court has a streamlined process in place that effectively orders local ISPs to block pirate sites. However, the intended global reach seems to be restricted to a few registrars, for now.\n\nA copy of the High Court order, issued on December 18, 2025, by Justice Tejas Karia, is available here (pdf). The court order includes 163 unique domain names, some of which are not linked to a registrar. An overview of the 125 domains that are linked to targeted registrars and related entities is provided below. .",

    "fullText": "The story’s main image: an 18th-century self-portrait showing a painter seated in an upholstered wooden chair in front of a light gray wall. He’s looking straight ahead, directly at the viewer, with his body turned to the left of the picture. He has brown hair, which hangs down just past his ears, and dark eyes. His mouth is closed, and he has a scar on his cheek. He is wearing a dark gray coat with pinkish-burgundy trim over a white shirt, and he has a white bow tied around his neck. He holds a single paintbrush in one hand and more brushes and a palette in the other. There are smears of red, white, pink, and gray paint on the palette, and there are some marks on the wall behind him.\n\nA painting of Socrates, about to drink the hemlock that will kill him. He sits on what appears to be a bed, near the center of the picture, surrounded by people draped in colorful cloth. Some look at him, while others look away or hold their heads in their hands. He wears a white cloth that bares his chest and stomach. With his left hand, he points toward the ceiling; with his right hand, he reaches for a cup, which is held by a person in a red cloth whose head is turned, and whose eyes are hidden. In the background, on the left, an archway opens onto a stairwell, where a few more people are standing.\n\nA photograph of a museumgoer wearing a quilted blue jacket and facing a very large painting. The painting depicts the coronation of Napoleon, in Notre-Dame Cathedral, with a richly dressed crowd in attendance. The museumgoer stands off to the right.\n\nBack to the story’s main image.\n\nA photograph of a large-scale painting — a Roman scene — in a museum gallery room.\n\nA closer view of the painting: In the center stands a bearded man draped in gray and red cloth. He’s holding three swords with their blades facing down, and he’s facing three helmeted men who reach out their arms to him from the left side of the picture. On the right sit several women and children — leaning on one another, apparently in consolation.\n\nA detailed sketch of a large, boisterous crowd gathered on an indoor tennis court — a big room with a high ceiling. In the center, a man stands on a table. He faces forward, raising his right hand and holding a piece of paper in his left hand. Along the left and right sides of the room, up near the ceiling, there are rows of open windows, where more people look in and curtains billow.\n\nA scrolling display of historical images — mostly black-and-white prints on yellowed pages — showing scenes from the French revolution: fighting in the streets, a trial, guillotines. There are also, amid these, a portrait of Jacques-Louis David and a sketch of Marie Antoinette.\n\nA photograph of a painting in a darkened room in a museum.\n\nA closer view of the painting: A dead or dying man sits in a bath, slumped over to his right side. His head is wrapped in a white cloth, his eyes are closed and he has a gash in his chest. The bath water is bloody, and the tub itself is draped in green and white cloth. The man holds a blood-stained piece of paper in his left hand and a quill in his right. There is a bloody knife with a white handle on the ground beside him. Next to the bath is a wooden box, with another quill, an inkpot and some papers on top of it. There is some writing on the side of the box, including the words “À Marat” and “David.”\n\nBack to the story’s main image.\n\nA detailed sketch of a Roman scene: A bearded man sits in shadow in the foreground, holding a piece of paper in his left hand and raising his right hand to his head. Behind him, other men carry out bodies covered by sheets. Off to his side, a woman raises her arms and moves toward the bodies and the men carrying them. She appears to be in distress, as do several others who are clustered around her.\n\nA finished version of the sketch seen above: The composition and the figures in it are much the same, but here they are rendered in colorful paint.\n\nA sketch of a woman on a yellowed, widely gridded sheet of paper. She is draped in a white cloth and stretching her arms out to her sides. Her head is turned to her left. Beneath her, in small letters, is some writing in script.\n\nClose-up of a painting showing the same woman, now surrounded by other figures: women and children, and men holding shields and swords.\n\nA slightly wider view, showing women holding children up high above their heads, and men holding spears.\n\nThe full painting: women and their children; men — many of them nude save for helmets and neck shawls — wielding their weapons; horses; and a large building in the background.\n\nA photograph of a painting in a museum.\n\nA closer view of the painting, which shows Napoleon astride a rearing white horse. He wears military dress, including a bicorne hat, and he’s wrapped in an orange cape. His left hand is gloved and holds the horse’s reins; his right hand is bare and points ahead. Behind him, soldiers push a cannon and a French flag waves. Mountains rise in the background.\n\nA different version of the story’s main image: It’s the same picture, but the colors are warmer and there appears to be less texture.\n\nA photograph of the story’s main image, framed and hanging in a darkened room in a museum.\n\nBack to the story’s main image.",

    "description": "As the Trump administration erodes U.S. | As the Trump administration erodes U.S. infrastructure supporting infectious disease vaccines, mRNA heavyweight Moderna plans to pull away from late-stage clinical trial investments in the area.",
    "fullText": "As the Trump administration erodes U.S. infrastructure supporting infectious disease vaccines, mRNA heavyweight Moderna plans to pull away from late-stage clinical trial investments in the area.\n\n“We do not foresee investing in new phase 3 studies in a foreseeable futures [sic] in vaccines,” Moderna’s CEO Stéphane Bancel told Bloomberg TV, placing emphasis on the word “new.”\n\nWhen asked if the anti-vaccine climate is going to affect Moderna’s business and ability to develop more vaccines, Bancel said, “100%.”\n\nYou cannot make a return on investment if you don't have access to the U.S. market, or because of delays—regulatory-wise—or because your market is much smaller, because you don't have a recommendation by the government,” Bancel said yesterday on the ‍sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nCurrently, the company touts 12 viral or bacterial vaccine programs in phase 2 development or earlier, according to its online pipeline.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Moderna spokesperson pointed to the company’s priorities set out in its Nov. 20 earnings release. At the time, the mRNA specialist announced the discontinuation of four clinical mRNA programs and outlined a three-year business strategy with the goal of boosting revenue by 10% in 2026.\n\n“Over the next three years, we expect to build a large seasonal vaccine franchise for at-risk populations and invest the cash generated into oncology and rare disease therapeutics,” Bancel said at the time.\n\nThe November release also outlines Europe as “a significant market for respiratory virus vaccines.”\n\nThe Moderna spokesperson declined to comment on future plans for its current phase 2 infectious disease programs.\n\nBancel’s comments come days after Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Ph.D., rebuked Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., describing the lawyer’s stance on vaccines as “anti-science.”\n\nJust a few years ago, Moderna and Pfizer raced to develop and deliver COVID-19 vaccines—Spikevax and Comirnaty, respectively—to abate the worldwide pandemic. Their efforts and success prompted major revenue and investment not only into their companies but into the biopharma industry itself.\n\nBut over the last year, U.S. mistrust in vaccines has continued to accelerate, as long-time vaccine conspiracist RFK. Jr. divests and dismantles federal infrastructure for the science. Just this month, the CDC overhauled the longstanding U.S. childhood vaccine schedule, removing broad vaccination recommendations for COVID, flu, rotavirus, meningitis, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n\nFor Bancel, the falling-out means Moderna is turning its focus toward cancer. Earlier this week, the company shared five-year data for its Merck & Co.-partnered cancer vaccine, which, when combined with Keytruda, cut the risk of cancer recurrence or death by 49% in comparison to Keytruda alone.\n\nThe move isn’t shocking, as Moderna’s Kyle Holen, M.D., head of development, therapeutics and oncology, told Fierce in October that most of the company's upcoming investigational new drug applications will be in the oncology space. Holen cited the political climate for developing infectious disease vaccines and “a huge unmet need in cancer” as reasons behind the decision.\n\nThough Moderna is moving away from vaccines for infectious diseases, Bancel has expressed disappointment about the action.\n\n“It is sad for us to see that. Vaccines that have been proven for decades helping people around the world are not recommended anymore,” he told Bloomberg TV.\n\n“If you look at all healthcare interventions, getting a vaccine is one of the highest return investments in the same year—not 10 or 20 years out—to prevent cardiac attack,” the leader said about COVID-19 and flu vaccines, noting that the inoculations also prevent hospitalizations related to severe illness.\n\n“We tend to forget that hospitalization is a big deal,” Bancel continued. “If you are 67 years old, you get hospitalized—in a week, you can lose 10% of your muscle mass. Ten percent muscle mass doesn't seem a lot like this, but it might mean the difference between you being able to live a high-quality life and your life becoming living from your bed to your sofa. So that’s the message about vaccines.”",

    "title": "'High School Musical' at 20: How Kenny Ortega made a musical on a shoestring budget — and turned it into a multibillion-dollar franchise",
    "description": "For the 20th anniversary of \"High School Musical,\" director-choreographer Kenny Ortega opened up about pitching, casting, and filming the franchise.",
    "fullText": "Do you remember what you were doing on this day 20 years ago? If you were an avid Disney Channel viewer, chances are, the answer is living and breathing \"High School Musical.\"\n\nIn January 2006, a direct-to-TV movie musical starring a cast of largely unknown teenagers set a single-night audience record on the Disney Channel. It was such a hit that the house of mouse promptly doubled down with repeat screenings, sing-along versions, piles of merchandise, and a live concert tour that packed arenas across the country. By the time the year was out, the soundtrack had become the top-selling album of 2006.\n\nNo one could have known that a Disney Channel Original Movie would eventually become a hit trilogy and multibillion-dollar franchise, but director Kenny Ortega was never in the business of half-heartedness. He'd already made a name for himself as a choreographer (\"Dirty Dancing,\" \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" Madonna's \"Material Girl\") and a director (\"Newsies,\" \"Hocus Pocus\"). He'd signed on to choreograph and direct \"High School Musical\" because he recognized his younger self in the story — but also because he saw potential for an ambitious production, complete with original songs and colorful dance sequences.\n\nOrtega successfully won support from Disney Channel executives to turn the original script into a \"full-on musical,\" which, at the time, was not a popular format for the network.\n\n\"The musical was dead, according to the industry,\" Ortega told Business Insider. \"The budget came in, and I was like, how the heck am I going to be able to do this?\"\n\nWith only about a month to shoot and a few million dollars to spend, it was crucial to ensure that each piece to the puzzle fit perfectly.\n\n\"We made every dollar stretch and every minute mean something,\" Ortega said. \"We didn't waste any time. Nothing ended up on the cutting room floor.\"\n\nOrtega and his team eventually landed on Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens to play Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez, a basketball star and a whiz kid who discover an unlikely love for theater. The high schoolers resolve to follow their dreams and, of course, fall in love in the process. Offscreen, Efron and Hudgens followed suit, dating for several years.\n\nAs \"High School Musical\" celebrates its 20th anniversary this week, Business Insider spoke with Ortega about the movie's key casting decisions, the actors' real-life relationships, and the potential for another sequel.\n\nIs it true that you wanted to run the auditions for \"High School Musical\" like Broadway auditions?\n\nI did. And I got in a little trouble for that in the beginning.\n\nI remember Judy Taylor, who I adore, who was head of casting at Disney Channel for many, many years, came to me during our big final testing. We had about 25 and 30 kids for the finals. And then we narrowed it down to about 18. And I had them in the room for about six hours — they were playing basketball, they were dancing, they were singing, they were improvising. I was flipping them around and switching them around and looking at the chemistry that was in the room and looking at the promise that was in front of me.\n\nThe next day, Judy came back and said, \"The agents are flipping out. They want to know what the heck's going on over here. These kids have other auditions, other people to meet, and you're holding them ransom.\"\n\nBut then the next day, Judy came back to me and said that Zac Efron's agent called her and said, \"Zac said it's the best audition he's ever been to.\" And that even if he didn't get the part, it was worth being a part of the auditioning.\n\nIt was such fun. The kids in that room with me were having an absolute ball. I don't think they'd ever been put through any kind of an audition like that, being West Coast actors and not East Coast theater actors. I put them through the mill.\n\nWere any of the main cast members almost passed over because there were concerns about their stamina, or their singing and dancing abilities?\n\nThere were questions. I mean, I think everybody saw the chemistry between Zac and Vanessa from the very, very beginning and knew that it was palpable and that that was going to be hard to top, but there were also concerns about whether they could handle the responsibility. They were young. Vanessa was 15, Zac was 16, and we were putting them in a full-on musical that they had to carry.\n\nFortunately, we also had the support of Ashley Tisdale and all the other brilliant [actors], Corbin Bleu and Lucas Grabeel and Monique Coleman. And beyond that, with people like Alyson Reed and Bart Johnson. And so we had them surrounded with a lot of great energy and intelligence, and we did it.\n\nBut no, I don't think anyone really was averse to any of the choices that we made. It was hard for me to get Ashley because she was already a big star for Disney Channel, and I think they were priming her for her own movie. And I was like, \"Please!\" I was crazy in love with what I knew she could do with this role, and she was delicious to work with.\n\nI can't imagine anyone else playing Sharpay.\n\nHonestly, every day she brought something to the party, to the game. There were days where she would come in and she would say to me, \"Don't say anything! Don't say anything! Can I show you something?\" She was just really an improvisational genius, and she really had her arms wrapped around Sharpay, and we had the most fun developing that role together and working with [screenwriter] Peter Barsocchini, of course.\n\nYou know, in the beginning, Ryan and Sharpay weren't brother and sister. They weren't twins. They were just two characters in the high school that were both in the theater department. But the chemistry that they had together in the auditions, I said, \"I think we should make them twins.\" I said, \"They've got something here that I think we could have a heck of a lot of fun with.\" And everybody agreed, and we moved forward with that idea.\n\nThis is an interesting point, because Ryan and Sharpay are auditioning to play a couple in the musical, are they not?\n\nYes. [Laughs.] We didn't change that. I don't think we thought it through. I think we were a little busy.\n\nDid any of the actors butt heads behind the scenes?\n\nNo. I mean, there was some really fun rapport between Lucas and Ashley that they incorporated into their work.\n\nThere was this wonderful kind of tug of war between the two of them. And then when the lights came on, and the cameras were rolling, it was just like they were onstage. They put it on.\n\nWe felt that. We saw that. We saw them bickering or challenging one another, and we just found it to be really great. And I didn't have to ask them to be anything. All I had to do was just turn on the camera and get out of the way.\n\nI was there to guide and direct and suggest and mold, but these kids brought a lot. They really did that. They studied, they cared. Day one, Zac said, \"Don't worry about time. Don't worry about working us, Kenny. We all committed to do this. Let's make it worth something. Let's make this worth us all being here.\"\n\nZac was initially really helpful in me sort of raising the bar on what I could expect from these young people. Because before that, other than \"Newsies,\" I hadn't been really experienced in working with kids that young.\n\nWas there any concern about Zac and Vanessa potentially breaking up during the trilogy?\n\nWell, I think you quietly have concern because you know that that could impact a kind of energy and comfort. And especially with younger kids, you want to make sure that it doesn't change the sort of climate and ease that we walk into every day. But it didn't weigh heavily on me. They were all friendly. They all got along. They all enjoyed each other's company. There was no one that was over here and everybody over here. They really all enjoyed each other's company. They were a tight-knit group of kids all through it. They were serving of one another, helpful to one another. And I don't remember that weighing on me.\n\nCertainly, no one said, \"Hey, be careful.\" No one really brought it up. And I wasn't aware that they even had a kind of romance, a kind of care for one another in that capacity, until almost the end of the first movie. And I thought it was so silly that I didn't pick up on it, but I was a little busy.\n\nWas there a version of the movie in which Troy and Gabriella do kiss at the end?\n\nI don't think at the end of one, no. I don't think we wanted that. And not because we knew that there would be a two. I just think that we felt that that was something that we could all hope and wish for, but that it wasn't time for it.\n\nI think Zac and Vanessa wanted it, if I'm not mistaken. I think both of them were like, \"We could do a little kiss. I think that it would end the movie in a really lovely place.\" And we said, \"You already have. You've already ended the movie in a really, really lovely place. There's all kinds of promise about where these two kids are going.\"\n\nZac has gone on to do other musicals like \"Hairspray\" and \"The Greatest Showman,\" which is maybe a surprise, given that he didn't do all his vocals in the first movie.\n\nHe did part of it. A lot of people don't know that. A lot of people think that he was lip-syncing the whole movie. He wasn't.\n\nDrew [Seeley] did an incredible job. Drew's an amazing composer and lyricist and performer and actor and singer, and he helped us. But because the music for one was written before we had Zac, the music wasn't written for Zac. And so there was some of the music there that was just out of his range. But he did a lot of it. And then Drew filled in some of the higher-register parts. But \"High School Musical 2\" and three is all Zac.\n\nWhose decision was that? Was it Zac coming to you, saying, \"I want to do the singing now,\" or was it your call?\n\nWe all wanted him to do it because we all wanted everybody to be doing their own work. And it was hard for him. It was a challenge, but God bless him, he accepted the role, and he went along with us, and he sang all through all those scenes where you see him, he's singing along with the track.\n\nWhen we knew that we were going to make a second, it was on everybody's plate. We're going to write the songs now, knowing Zac's voice, knowing Zac's range and register, so he can deliver all the music for the next movie.\n\nIn your mind, would Troy and Gabriella have made it as a couple? Twenty years later, are they still together?\n\nWell, that would be unfair of me. I wouldn't want to get in the way of Peter Barsocchini being able to write a fourth movie, if that's the plan. So I wouldn't want to throw anything out there, because as a director, I would want to be open to either way, whether they stayed together or whether they didn't stay together, that if I was fortunate enough to be invited to come back and do it again and everyone wanted to, that I would be open to looking at whatever Peter wanted to put in front of us as what he would think the future brought for those characters.\n\nI think all of us hope that they would be together, but maybe not necessarily as a couple, maybe just connected in some kind of wonderful, soulful, spiritual way. Friends, even. Who knows? We'll see. I don't know if it's going to happen, but it's been talked about.\n\nSo you're not connected to a fourth movie right now?\n\nNo, no, I'm not. No one has reached out to me and said, \"We're doing it.\" But I know that the fans have been asking, could we do some kind of coming back together, some kind of a reunion show? And hey, I'd just be happy with a nice dinner with everybody present and with no rush to get out after dessert.\n\nBut for the fans, I hope we could do something. I think that would be lovely. They're deserving. They've been amazing. They've changed all of our lives.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.",

    "fullText": "2026 has so far resembled the worst parts of 2025 at many quant hedge fund managers.\n\nThe beginning of the year had the worst stretch of losses since early October, according to a Goldman Sachs report, and several big-name managers did not avoid the pain.\n\nHSBC's Hedge Weekly report states that Renaissance Technologies' two largest funds lost roughly 4% each through January 9. A person familiar with Schonfeld said the manager's quant-only strategy was down 3.9% through January 16.\n\nEngineers Gate was down around 6% midway through the month, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nRenaissance, Schonfeld, and Engineers Gate declined to comment.\n\nThe average computer-run equity fund was down 1% through January 15, according to Goldman's note. The losses were mainly driven by US stocks, which have been choppy to start the year thanks to trade proposals floated by President Donald Trump's administration. Funds crowding into similar trades have also hurt returns, Goldman notes.\n\nPerformance on January 16 — not captured in the Goldman note — was especially bad for many quant funds, industry insiders said.\n\nLast year, systematic funds had several extended periods of losses, including a stint in June and July that one consultant described to Business Insider as \"a long, slow bleed.\" Funds gradually recouped summer losses, but ran into trouble again in early October when crowded trades, a momentum sell-off, and inflated junk stocks led to drawdowns.\n\nWhile funds again rebounded from those losses, the average quant returned 7.7% last year, according to hedge fund research firm PivotalPath, less than the average fund and the S&P 500's 2025 gain.\n\nPivotalPath flagged equity quant crowding as an investor concern in a January report, noting that spikes in crowding measures have preceded previous drawdowns in systematic trading strategies.",

    "description": "American Airlines and JetBlue are making it free to rebook flights ahead of a major winter storm.",
    "fullText": "Major airlines are making it free to change your flights ahead of a dangerous winter storm.\n\nSouthwest Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and JetBlue are waiving rebooking fees for flights to and from affected regions this weekend.\n\nIf your travel plans this weekend include major cities such as Dallas, Austin, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, you may want to contact your airline to avoid prolonged delays or cancellations at the airport. The National Weather Service is warning that more than 230 million Americans will be affected, from the Southwest to New England.\n\nEven if you won't change your plans, your flight may still get canceled. Delta Air Lines said Thursday it is canceling flights at airports in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee, citing safety concerns caused by heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain. The airline will also be bringing in cold-weather specialists.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, based on the Misery Map, which tracks real-time flight disruptions, there hasn't been a spike in delays or cancellations.\n\nBased on recent storms, such as the one that hit over Thanksgiving and coincided with the end of the government shutdown, mass cancellations may be inevitable. So it's good to know your passenger rights and your options when things don't go according to plan.\n\nIf your flight is canceled and you choose not to rebook, the airline is legally required to provide you with a cash refund — not a voucher or credit.\n\nHowever, things are different for delays. The Trump Administration recently killed a proposal that would have required airlines to compensate passengers for long delays, so flyers largely have to rely on airline goodwill or their credit cards to get anything for the inconvenience.\n\nSome airlines have committed to providing accommodations, transportation, and food during a controllable overnight delay or cancellation, as outlined in the Airline Customer Service Dashboard.\n\nControllable disruptions include issues such as maintenance or crew staffing. Frontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of a controllable overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nIt still doesn't hurt to ask for a meal or hotel voucher when a non-controllable issue arises, such as the weather. The worst they can say is no.\n\nDuring disruptions, airlines often allow you to make changes via their mobile app or website, rather than waiting on clogged phone lines or in long customer service lines.\n\nIf this isn't an option, try an online chat. Carriers like Delta Air Lines allow you to text a representative for help.\n\nYou can put yourself in the virtual queue and wait in line at the airport, potentially upping your chances of speaking with an agent sooner.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nTravel credit cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the American Express Platinum, offer built-in insurance that reimburses travelers for hotel, meal, and transportation expenses incurred due to certain flight disruptions.\n\nThe weather is typically covered. For this to work, the traveler would have needed to book their flight with that travel card.\n\nIf your credit card doesn't offer travel insurance, it may be worthwhile to purchase a separate trip insurance policy before traveling. This type of insurance can help reimburse costs you might lose due to flight problems, such as prepaid hotel stays or cruise bookings.\n\nHowever, you must purchase this insurance before any travel disruptions occur — once you know a flight might be affected, it's likely too late.",

    "description": "Online insurance firm Lemonade said it would offer a policy designed specifically for self-driving cars, starting with Tesla.",
    "fullText": "Tesla's car sales may have struggled recently, but Morgan Stanley says a recent update in the insurance space is a positive signal for the real bull case for Tesla stock: autonomous driving.\n\nOnline insurance provider Lemonade announced the launch of a new product for self-driving cars this week. The Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance will begin with a 50% rate cut for Tesla drivers when their vehicle's autonomous driving software is in control.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts say this is a \"critical unlock\" for Tesla and the broader self-driving car market. It indicates that insurance providers may finally be gaining confidence in autonomous technology.\n\nOne of the largest hurdles to autonomous driving has been insurance providers' reluctance. High uncertainty regarding liability and risk has prompted many companies to avoid insuring vehicles with autonomous capabilities.\n\nLemonade's decision to start ensuring Tesla vehicles equipped with the tech might mark a breakthrough, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n\"This is an important shift in how insurers treat advanced driver-assistance and autonomy features,\" he said. \"Lemonade's approach suggests growing confidence in the data coming from Tesla's fleet, using real-world driving outcomes to assess safety performance rather than relying solely on theoretical or regulatory classifications.\"\n\nWhile Lemonade's announcement is specific to Tesla cars for now, the EV leader is seen as a bellwether for the autonomous driving industry. Percoco added that he expects more companies to follow Lemonade and start insuring self-driving cars.\n\n\"Lemonade's announcement points toward a future in which insurance becomes one of the clearest market-based validators of autonomous driving progress,\" he wrote.\n\nWith Tesla's electric vehicle sales down for two consecutive years, Elon Musk is betting big on autonomous driving, and investors see the technology as the primary justification for the stock's premium valuation. More accessible insurance could hasten the adoption of autonomous driving tech.\n\n\"As insurers incorporate increasingly granular driving data into pricing, technologies that demonstrably reduce risk should be rewarded faster and more transparently,\" he noted. \"For Tesla, this marks another step toward external recognition that FSD is moving from an experimental feature to an economically relevant safety system.\"",

    "description": "Goldman just completed its second-best year on record by revenue, and its stock has been surging, which has contributed to David Solomon's rising pay.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs' David Solomon has restored the bank's swagger — and it just rewarded him with a $47 million pay package for 2025.\n\nIt's his highest annual pay yet, and it puts him ahead of his top competitor on Wall Street, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, whose firm announced this week it would pay him $43 million for last year's performance.\n\nSolomon's prior-year compensation was $39 million for 2024, meaning this year's pay is up 21%.\n\nGoldman announced his compensation in a regulatory filing on Friday, citing \"continued and significant shareholder value creation during 2025, including a total shareholder return of 57%,\" under Solomon's leadership. It touted \"strong firmwide financial performance\" and \"continued advancement of our people strategy\" amid heightened competition for talent.\n\nSolomon won't take home all $47 million in cash — his base salary is $2 million, a cash component makes up $10 million, and the rest will be distributed across stock units and carried interest, the bank said. The performance stock units that Goldman awarded Solomon make up the lion's share of the pay package: $31.5 million.\n\nNext month, it's expected that other banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup will announce their chief execution compensation as well.\n\nSolomon's pay is a bellwether for how the board thinks the firm is doing, and has been directly linked to performance. At the moment, shareholders seem pleased with Solomon's approach to management, with its stock up more than 43% in the past year.\n\nThe firm just wrapped its second-best year overall, reporting net revenues of more than $58 billion in its most recent earnings disclosure last week.\n\nAnd its investment bank, which handles high-profile corporate mergers and capital-raising events, also had its best year ever by revenue. Goldman said its 2025 banking and markets revenues were more than $41 billion, up 18% over the year prior; and investment banking fees were up 21%.\n\nWhen he spoke to shareholders and analysts this earnings season, Solomon doubled down on his commitment to steer the firm through the AI revolution, and said 2026 M&A levels could rise to or surpass the records observed in 2021.\n\nThough he had a rough few years, punctuated by stinging headlines and internal ups-and-downs — including rifts over a misfired consumer banking strategy and his stint as a DJ — Solomon has largely put the public criticism to bed and aligned its ranks behind a vision he first outlined at an Investor Day about six years ago.\n\nRoughly a year ago, the bank awarded Solomon and his deputy, President and COO John Waldron, $80 million each in restricted stock units set to vest over a five-year period.\n\nBut when his reputation has taken a bruising, so has his paycheck. In 2022, Solomon took a 30% pay cut during a difficult year for Goldman, including when his consumer banking ambitions tanked.",

    "description": "As a seasoned travel planner, I have suggestions for the best European destinations to visit, from Italy's Cinque Terre to France's Strasbourg.",
    "fullText": "As a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels, I've explored Europe extensively to find the best recommendations for my clients.\n\nThough popular cities such as Paris, London, Rome, and Amsterdam have massive appeal, the continent's vast landscape offers gems around every corner.\n\nHere are five European destinations I think everyone should visit at least once.\n\nSalzburg is a stunning destination — especially if you're a \"Sound of Music\" fan.\n\nThere are plenty of prearranged tours to iconic filming locations where you can dance around the Pegasus fountain like Maria and the children, visit the \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" gazebo, and tour the stunning Basilika St. Michael, where Maria was married to Captain Von Trapp.\n\nIn the summer and fall, there are even \"Sound of Music\" bike tours available.\n\nAnd yes, there are plenty of other activities in the city, even if you're not into musicals. Young children may like the Salzburg Zoo, and music lovers can explore Mozart's birthplace and residence.\n\nSitting atop a hill, Hohensalzburg Fortress is one of the largest castles in the area and boasts great views of the city. To get another stunning view, take the Untersberg cable car.\n\nJust a few hours from London by train, Liverpool is a must-visit spot for Beatles fans.\n\nAll four band members grew up in the port city. There are many different types of excursions, from short bus rides to full-day private tours that will immerse you in the sights and sounds of the band's legacy.\n\nIn Liverpool, football (or American soccer) is a way of life, and there are two main clubs here: Liverpool and Everton. Fans of the game can take an LFC stadium tour for a behind-the-scenes look.\n\nThe city also houses a slew of theaters, art galleries, and museums — and it's becoming a hot destination for shopping and unique culinary experiences.\n\nCinque Terre is one of my favorite cities — or, more accurately, my favorite collection of five villages.\n\nNestled along the Italian Riviera, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore are accessible only by train, ferry, or foot.\n\nEach has a distinct style, and hikers flock to this region to enjoy the beautiful scenery.\n\nVernazza, my favorite village, is the gem of this region. I love wandering the cobbled streets to shop, snack, and explore. You can also visit the Castello Doria or the church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia.\n\nIn the summer months, tourists sunbathe on the beaches of Monterosso or take a dip in the sea. For a history lesson, visit the remains of Castello Fieschi or the Church of St John the Baptist and the Capuchin Monastery.\n\nIn Manarola, take some time to watch locals cliff-jump into the marina. I also suggest taking a wine tour through the town to sample some local specialties. Be sure to try Sciacchetrà, a sweet but strong dessert wine produced in Cinque Terre.\n\nRiomaggiore is also home to a castle and churches dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. The center of the town is great for wandering, shopping, and eating.\n\nCorniglia is probably the quietest of the five villages. There, climb the Lardarina staircase for beautiful views of the coastline or take a boat tour to fully enjoy the area's beauty.\n\nJust about two hours east of Paris by high-speed train, Strasbourg is a beautiful city along the border of France and Germany.\n\nEvery trip should include a visit to the Gothic Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Strasbourg. Try to plan your day around arriving there at 12:30 p.m. to see the wooden figures dance around the clock.\n\nAfter your cathedral visit, stroll through Petite France, explore cheese shops, and take a break to sip a glass of wine at one of the canal's many cafés.\n\nAt the end of the year, Strasbourg is also home to one of the oldest Christmas markets, dating back to the late 1500s. The Christkindelsmärik is truly magical, with more than 300 vendors selling their holiday best.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 3, 2024, and most recently updated on January 23, 2026.",

    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. US, The Nation’s justice correspondent reminds us why government matters—and why ICE has nothing to do with actual government. Plus, Hawai’i’s brilliant legal maneuver.\n\nEarlier this week, the Trump administration attempted to prosecute journalist Don Lemon for his coverage of protests inside a Minneapolis church. The protesters had flooded the church to call for the resignation of pastor David Easterwood, who allegedly works for ICE. But on Thursday, a federal magistrate in Minnesota rejected the criminal complaint filed by the Department of Justice—a ruling that allegedly “enraged” Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nTwo activists, Nekima Levy Armstrong and Chauntyll Louisa Allen, have been arrested by the FBI in connection with the protest.\n\nThere has been a lot of naysaying about these protests, especially from “Never Trumpers.” Even as people are coalescing around the idea that ICE needs to be stopped, the sight of people protesting inside a church has given the moderates an opportunity to appear, well, moderate about the methods for dispelling ICE.\n\nI am not the protest police, but I will say that there are good First Amendment reasons to protect the sanctity of houses of worship. Protecting people from being harassed while they are inside their places of worship is the legally right thing to do to protect people’s free exercise of religion, even if we think the people worshiping are misguided or even evil in some way. Protesting outside of a person’s church (or house) is great. Protesting inside a person’s sanctuary is violative, and unnecessarily so.\n\nI’ll also point out that ICE regularly violates those sanctuaries, and that protecting people from government interference in their places of worship is even more important than protecting people from private actions.\n\nThere are even stronger First Amendment–based reasons to protect the right of journalists to cover such protests. Trying to charge Lemon for covering protests inside a church is the greater attack on the First Amendment.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of hand-wringing from online moderates over the protests inside the church. I haven’t seen enough outrage over the state harassment of a journalist like Lemon for covering the thing that alerted all the moderates to get their underwear in a bunch. I think if you are more concerned about private acts of resistance than state acts of totalitarianism, you are doing it wrong.\n\nStudentNation\n\n /\n\n Colin Warren\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nTo understand this week’s worst argument, you need to take a moment to appreciate the very best argument, which was made by the state of Hawaii. In 2022’s New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Supreme Court eviscerated gun regulations in this country. The court announced that for a gun law to exist in the modern era, it had to have some historical analogue to a gun law that existed at or before the founding of the country. To regulate an Uzi, you have to show that a “historical twin” regulation applied to a musket.\n\nThe rule is beyond stupid as an intellectual proposition, but it’s also practically unworkable. What is a close enough “historical analogue”? Nobody knows. Since Bruen, the Supreme Court has been trying to make it up as it goes along.\n\nWell, Hawaii looked at all that chaos and said “challenge accepted.” The state passed a gun law specifically designed to either meet Bruen’s preposterous criteria or, ultimately, expose the court’s deep hypocrisy when applying Bruen. The law requires gun owners to receive explicit permission from property owners before they can bring their weapons onto private property. It’s been dubbed the “vampire rule,” based on the trope that vampires need to receive permission before entering your home.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court’s own logic in Bruen, Hawaii’s law should be upheld. The state can cite historical analogues for its rules that go well beyond Nosferatu. In 1763 and 1771, New York and New Jersey respectively imposed similar restrictions.\n\nAnd yet, the law isn’t going to hold (here’s where we get to the “worst” argument part). As Ian Millhiser explains, “[I]t turns out that none of this history actually matters, as all six of the Court’s Republicans…signaled Tuesday that they are likely to strike the law down.”\n\nTo accomplish this hypocrisy, the core Republican argument was that the Second Amendment should be treated like any other constitutional right, and the government cannot essentially enact a prior restraint on constitutional rights. But that argument that the Second Amendment should be treated like any other amendment fails the Republicans’ own requirements, laid out in Bruen, that the Second Amendment is so super special that modern regulations must be tied to a specific historically analogous law before it can be enacted. No other constitutional amendment gets that protection. If the Second Amendment is to be treated like every other one, then the entire logic of Bruen should fall apart.\n\nBut the Republicans on the Supreme Court want it both ways, and since they have a supermajority, they will have it both ways. When a gun regulation doesn’t have a doppelgänger from the 18th freaking century, Republicans will strike down the law because the Second Amendment allegedly means the same thing now as it did then. When a gun regulation does have a doppelgänger from the 18th century, the Republicans will strike down the law because the Second Amendment magically means something different now from what it meant then.\n\nThe only true way to track the Republicans’ logic on the Second Amendment is to ask the question: “Will this lead to people being shot to death?” If yes, the Republicans on the Supreme Court are in favor of it.\n\nThe Supreme Court also heard oral arguments this week in Trump v. Cook, the case concerning Trump’s attempts to fire Fed Reserve Board Commissioner Lisa Cook. Most likely, this will go down as a rare loss for Trump in front of his court. Why? I explain that it’s all about the money.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nApparently, it’s going to snow this weekend. A lot. Pretty much everywhere (no, not you, San Diego. You people will continue to enjoy your perfect weather… until the earth swallows you whole).\n\nSnowstorms, and weather events in general, really highlight the isolation of the modern human condition. We don’t come together ahead of these things; we go to ground. Before Trump came to the White House, I was pretty sure that the nadir of American culture could be witnessed at a Costco 24 hours before a snowstorm or hurricane.\n\nI can’t even say the hoarding mentality is wrong, or at least I can’t say that it’s irrational, because the other thing weather events do is highlight how desperately most people rely on government services. If the government doesn’t clear the roads, people can’t get to work, including the people whose jobs are to keep all the other services and infrastructure up and running.\n\nI’m relatively privileged, but this week a small part broke in my furnace, and I was without heat for 24 hours. I was able to get it fixed but, if that had happened during the snowstorm… nobody could come to fix my problem if the city didn’t plow the roads. I need the government to function so I can even access my privilege, and I need it to function the most when things are all screwed up.\n\nBut that’s the thing about government: When it’s working, most people don’t notice it. When it’s not working, people sure as shit notice it, but most people don’t carry that knowledge through Election Day. Accountability rarely follows disaster. Last July, a rainstorm killed 27 campers and counselors at Camp Mystic in Texas; none of the politicians responsible, including Texas Governor Gregg Abbott, has paid a price for the inaction. But a couple of people have been fired from their jobs for making inappropriate social media posts after the tragedy.\n\nOf course, I’ve just explained the fundamentally asymmetrical battle Democrats have to fight every day. Republicans say government doesn’t work, then they make government not work. Then when government doesn’t work people say, “See, government doesn’t work” and vote for Republicans. Democrats say government can work, and when they make it work… nobody notices or cares.\n\nBottom line: If New York City handles the snowstorm well, I want Zorhan Mamdani doing an ad with a snow shovel saying, “you’re welcome.” Lord knows he’ll be blamed if things don’t go well, even though he hasn’t been on the job long enough to reform New York’s snow preparedness system.\n\nStay safe, and warm, this weekend. And if things go well or go to shit, try to remember why.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

    "title": "Taylor Swift's real-life texts to Blake Lively sound a lot like her lyrics",
    "description": "Taylor Swift's texts to Blake Lively, unsealed amid Lively's lawsuit against Justin Baldoni, showcase their bond and Swift's communication style.",
    "fullText": "Picture this: You've just received a text from Taylor Swift.\n\nIt's easy to imagine her missives resembling her famously personal song lyrics. Something honest and vulnerable, like, \"I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,\" or tender, like, \"I don't wanna miss you like this. Come back, be here,\" or even sassy, like, \"Good thing I like my friends canceled.\"\n\nWell, thanks to a slew of newly unsealed court documents, we now have evidence that's not far from the truth.\n\n\"I think I'm just exhausted in every avenue of my life,\" Swift seemingly wrote to her friend Blake Lively in December 2024. \"You don't need to apologize. Just come back please.\" Earlier that year, Swift apparently praised her longtime friend's tenacity: \"No one. Should ever. Get into a war of wills with you.\"\n\nSeveral text messages between Swift and Lively were recently made public amid Lively's legal battle with Justin Baldoni, her director and costar on the hit 2024 movie \"It Ends with Us.\" These particular texts presumably became relevant to the lawsuit because Baldoni's name was mentioned (or alluded to, as when Lively wrote to Swift about \"this doofus director of my movie\"). In some cases, they speak to Lively's state of mind while the two actors were filming \"It Ends With Us,\" and amid the breakdown of Lively and Baldoni's working relationship.\n\nDespite these nuggets of insight, however, some of the most interesting details of Lively's conversations with Swift are the ones that offer a unique glimpse into Swift's writerly craft.\n\nSwift is already renowned for her lyricism. The same week these texts were unsealed, she became the youngest woman ever to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame — in her very first year of eligibility, no less. But these texts reveal a less polished, less reputation-conscious version of Swift's communication style.\n\nAccording to these court documents, Lively texted Swift on December 4, 2024, shortly before the end of the Eras Tour, to temperature-check their friendship. Lively and Swift have been close friends for years (Swift is the godmother to Lively's children), but the actor felt that something in their dynamic had shifted.\n\n\"Hey, just checking in,\" Lively wrote to Swift. \"I have no reason to ask, but I donno, l've been feeling like I should… is everything OK?\"\n\nLively went on to say she felt like a \"bad friend lately,\" that she didn't want to come across as \"needy and awkward,\" but her gut (and her husband, Ryan Reynolds) told her to reach out anyway. \"I always want the opportunity to be a better friend if there's something I unintentionally did,\" she wrote.\n\nIf you've ever gone through a rough patch with a loved one, then this brand of ambient, unsettled anxiety will surely feel familiar. It's really hard to communicate complex emotions, especially when an important relationship is at stake, and the conversation isn't face-to-face.\n\nLuckily, written communication of complex emotions is exactly Swift's forte.\n\n\"I feel really bad saying anything about this because your texts have been so nice in their intent but your last few… it's felt like I was reading a mass corporate email sent to 200 employees,\" Swift replied in part. \"You said the word 'we' like 18 times. And it feels awful to be in any way critical of any way you process what you've been going through but I just kinda miss my funny, dark, normal-speaking friend who talks to me as herself, not like. A plural unit.\"\n\nShe added: \"I know you feel attacked from all sides for ridiculous reasons so you're feeling like you have to overly explain things or be overly nice or whatever but. It's me! That's just caused a little distance.\"\n\nSwift's response is exactly what I'd hope to receive from a friend in that position: open-hearted and generous, yet firm and forthright. She doesn't treat Lively with kid gloves, nor does she pile on. Instead, she validates her friend's anxiety, clarifies her own perspective, and reinforces their bond.\n\nOver the past two decades, Swift has built an empire by making fans feel like her friends, writing songs that sound like heart-to-hearts. It's oddly comforting to know that Swift writes to her actual friends with the same attention to detail.",

    "fullText": "Enterprise is the latest company caught in the crosshairs of anti-ICE protests.\n\nA video showing protesters lined up outside of a Minnesota Enterprise Rent-A-Car location went viral earlier this week on TikTok, part of an \"Ice out Enterprise\" protest campaign.\n\nOrganizers encouraged participants to disrupt Enterprise's operations by reserving rental cars and then canceling the bookings shortly before pickup — a tactic they say is designed to draw attention and strain vehicle availability that could be utilized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\n\"Enterprise is renting cars to ICE agents and profiting from the violence that agents are bringing to our communities,\" Minnesota organizers associated with the Sunrise Movement, a progressive climate and social justice advocacy group, posted on social media. The post asked protestors to \"please be polite to employees when you contact them.\"\n\nbrought the workers donuts too- it’s not them we’re protesting, it’s corporate policy that requires them to rent to kidnappers! hint: you can do this at your local enterprise too… #minneapolis #minnesota #ice #protest\n\nAn Enterprise employee working the counter at one of the rental car company's Saint Paul, Minnesota, locations confirmed to Business Insider on Friday that protesters had been calling the store. The employee declined to comment further, citing the company's media policy.\n\n\"I've called and told them I was disappointed that they were collaborating with ICE,\" a commenter on Instagram said.\n\n\"They answered the phone super quickly,\" another added. \"I was told a complaint would be logged right away.\"\n\nThe viral video, which was posted on Thursday, had more than 323,000 views on TikTok as of publication. It shows a line of demonstrators holding signs reading \"No cars for ICE\" and \"Cancel ICE contracts now.\"\n\nIt's unclear if Enterprise has any contract with ICE. Enterprise did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe effort is part of a \"week of actions\" in Minnesota leading up to a \"business blackout\" on Friday to protest ICE's presence in the state. The Sunrise and Sunrise Twin Cities groups didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nA post shared by Sunrise Movement - Twin Cities Hub (@sunrise.twincities)\n\nThe video has also drawn reactions from conservative commentators on X.\n\n\"Anti-ICE leftists are now booking and canceling car reservations at Enterprise to protest them renting cars to ICE,\" wrote Chaya Raichik, who operates the popular Libs of TikTik account on X, in a post with more than 208,000 views.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Business Insider in a statement that \"dangerous\" protest efforts had led to a rise in violence against ICE officers. \"ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,\" she said.\n\nEnterprise is the latest major corporation to face consumer pressure as immigration enforcement activity in Minnesota has drawn widespread protest.\n\nEarlier this month, Hilton removed a franchisee from its portfolio after a video that purported to show a hotel employee refusing to provide immigration enforcement officers rooms.\n\nIn a statement, the hotel chain criticized the operator and said its corporate policy was to make all locations \"a welcoming place for all\" and that it does \"not discriminate against any individuals or agencies.\"\n\nMinneapolis-based Target has also faced heat from activists who accused the retailer of cooperating with immigration officials. The retailer denied those claims an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.\n\n\"Target does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency,\" human resources chief Melissa Kremer wrote to employees. \"We're listening and working to de-escalate where possible.\"\n\nEnterprise, which runs around two dozen locations in the Twin Cities, is still facing calls from Minnesota-based protestors.",

    "description": "Amazon employees respond to expected layoffs and corporate job cuts by posting memes referencing  founder Jeff Bezos' two-pizza rule.",
    "fullText": "Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes.\n\nThe company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October.\n\nIn the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed.\n\nThe focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous \"two-pizza rule,\" originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.\n\nAs the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption \"how we feed two pizza teams.\"\n\nAnother image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption \"did someone say 2 pizza team?\" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal,\" one employee wrote in the Slack channel. \"Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage.\"\n\nOthers wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered \"reasonably sized.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas,\" another employee wrote.\n\nThe pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes.\n\nOne riffed on the rumored timing, splashing \"JANUARY 27TH\" over the scene from \"The Shining\" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and \"AWS\" over his face.\n\nAnother meme used the \"panik/kalm\" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words \"Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)\", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble.\n\nOther posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: \"able to login,\" \"mail and Slack works,\" and \"no random HR meeting in calendar.\"\n\nAnother simply captured the vibe in all caps: \"I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\"\n\nAmazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - India can leverage its growing energy demand to negotiate better oil and gas ​supply deals, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday, ‌as its refiners continue seeking alternatives to Russian oil.\n\nIndia became the top buyer of discounted ‌Russian seaborne crude after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but challenges posed by Western sanctions eventually prompted Indian refiners to increase imports from other sources.\n\nIndian officials have been careful to avoid directly referencing Russian oil ⁠imports, but Puri said ‌supplies from \"one source\" that had surged after February 2022, were now easing.\n\nData obtained from trade sources showed India's Russian ‍oil imports fell to their lowest level in two years in December, lifting OPEC's share of imports to an 11-month high.\n\nIndia's rising oil demand gives it \"a ​little bit of positioning inside the world\" to negotiate better deals, ‌Puri said.\n\nThe world's third-largest oil importer and consumer should have no trouble covering its needs given ample global supplies and rising output in countries such as Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and the United States.\n\nIndian refiners have been buying more oil from Middle Eastern, African and South American ⁠countries to make up for a drop ​in Russian oil imports, which is expected ​to help India negotiate a tariff deal with Washington.\n\nPuri said Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd had doubled the size of its ‍annual contract with ⁠Brazil's Petrobras.\n\nIndian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, has bought 7 million barrels of oil, including from Brazil's Petrobras, for March ⁠loading to replace Russian oil, trade sources said.\n\nIOC last month bought its first Colombian ‌oil and for the first time bought Ecuadorean Oriente crude.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Nidhi VermaEditing by Tomasz Janowski)",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A report by former special counsel Jack Smith on his investigation into President Donald Trump's hoarding of classified documents belongs in the “dustbin of history\" and should remain sealed, the Justice Department said in a sharply worded court filing Friday.\n\n“The illicit product of an unlawful investigation and prosecution belongs in the dustbin of history. The United States will leave it there,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe department's position echoes that of Trump, whose lawyers this week asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to permanently block the release of the Smith report. It adds to the likelihood that a detailed report on a criminal investigation once seen as posing significant legal peril to Trump might continue to remain hidden from public view.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Biden and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, after he left the White House following his first term.\n\nBoth investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith's team after Trump's November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nThe volume on the election investigation was released in the final days of the Biden administration. But Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida who issued multiple favorable rulings for Trump and his two co-defendants in the classified documents case, last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with that case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe injunction is set to lift on February 24.\n\nBut Jason Reding Quiñones, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where the case was filed, said in a three-page court filing that the report should remain sealed. He and another prosecutor in that office, Manolo Reboso, wrote that Smith's investigation was “unlawful from its inception.”\n\nThey also wrote that Attorney General Pam Bondi had determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department.\n\n“Smith not only weaponized the Department of Justice against a leading presidential candidate in pursuit of an anti-democratic end, but he did so without legal authority and while targeting constitutionally protected activity,” the prosecutors wrote.\n\nSmith, during his testimony Thursday, defended his investigations of Trump and insisted that he had acted without regard to politics and had no second thoughts about the criminal charges he brought.\n\n“No one should be above the law in our country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,” Smith said of Trump.",

    "fullText": "Lawmakers and military families denounced President Donald Trump’s shocking remarks denigrating NATO troops who were injured and died fighting for the U.S. in Afghanistan after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump questioned whether NATO “will be there if we ever need them.”\n\n“We’ve never needed them,” he told Maria Bartiromo. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

    "description": "More slick dramas filled with family feuds and shady business dealings.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Sheridan and Billy Bob Thornton are such a natural pairing that it's not at all surprising that Landman has been yet another hit for the creator behind Yellowstone and it's many spin-offs. Thornton plays Billy Norris, a crackerjack consultant, fixer, and general hired gun for a major oil conglomerate in present-day West Texas. Beyond the complicated economics and politics of the oil industry, the poor guy's also dealing with extremely complicated family drama, debt, criminal ties, and substance-abuse issues. Call it Dallas for a new generation.\n\nYou can stream Landman on Paramount+, and check out these similar shows after your binge is complete.\n\nAnother Taylor Sheridan creation, this one stars Jeremy Renner as Mike McLusky, head of a family that’s been keeping the peace, more or less, in the title's company town for decades. The \"business\" of the corrupt burg just happens to be incarceration, and the McLuskys thrive when business is up, even if Mike himself has slightly different ideas about how to run things. The show deals, at least broadly, with systemic racism and inequality in the prison system, but mostly it's a modern day western about bringing justice to a corrupt town. Stream Mayor of Kingstown on Paramount+.\n\nIt's tempting to direct you back to the original series' 14-season run, but that one's a harder to stream—and besides, this direct continuation is still pretty fun. Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray and Larry Hagman (as the original's J.R.) are all back, joined by a new generation lead by Josh Henderson, Jesse Metcalf, and Jordana Brewster. They're every bit as scheming, conniving, horny, and oil obsessed as their parents. Stream Dallas on Tubi.\n\nThe Taylor Sheridan drama that launched an empire, as well as a thousand spin-offs (well, seven, including those in development). The Dutton family of Montana, owners of the largest cattle ranch in the state, deal with family and political drama—a bit like a modern Dallas, but with the vibes of HBO’s Succession. Though the main series ended after five seasons, mostly to accommodate the departure of Kevin Costner, there's plenty more to explore in the past and future of the Yellowstone universe. Stream Yellowstone on Peacock.\n\nTerrence Howard leads a truly impressive cast (among them Taraji P. Henson, Gabourey Sidibe, and Vivica A. Fox) in this juicy, glossy, hip-hop infused soap opera. Howard plays Lucious Jackson (neé drug dealer Dwight Walker), who changed his own fortunes by building Empire Entertainment from the ground up. As the series begins, the music mogul is diagnosed with ALS and given a life expectancy of only a few more years. Refusing to watch his life's work die, he sets his three sons at odds to determine who’ll be the one to control things when he’s gone. His schemes are complicated by the release from prison of Cookie Lyon (Henson), the co-founder of the company and Jackson’s ex-wife. As the kids say: drama! There's a little bit of Dallas and a little bit of Succession (which Empire predates) here, sharing with those shows and Landman the whole family dynasty thing, but with hip-hop rather than black gold. Stream Empire on Hulu and Tubi.\n\nIf the pull of Landman is Billy Bob Thornton as a complicated anti-hero with substance abuse issues, this David E. Kelley legal drama will work just fine as a streamalike, even in the absence of oil wells. Here, Thornton plays Billy McBride, a once-successful lawyer who left the firm he built after a murder suspect he'd gotten acquitted went on to kill his family. After a long run of doing not much other than drinking, he's drawn back into the fray when a dead man's sister asks for his help on a case involving his old firm, a major corporation, and some very crooked cops. Stream Goliath on Prime Video.\n\nAmerican TV shows tend to view the wealthy with nuance, even when they're engaged in overtly criminal behavior. South Korean creators, on the other hand, have no problem criticizing the 1% (Parasite and Squid Game are hardly outliers), particularly the plutocratic chaebol families who control huge portions of the country’s economy. The minseries Mine centers the women who are jockeying for control of the massive, fictional Hyowon Group from within their family’s outrageously opulent (and extremely photogenic) residential compound. The plans of two increasingly powerful women who married into the family, Hi-soo and Seo-hyun, are thrown into disarray when the new housemaid begins a romantic relationship with one of the male heirs, while a new tutor seems ready to expose old family secrets. It’s very much a Dynasty-style soap opera, with various family members crawling over each other seeking control and a sense of identity. Stream Mine on Netflix.\n\nSwapping big-time oil for a family fishing business may seem like a big leap, but we've still got plenty of crime and drugs in this Netflix series. Holt McCallany plays Harlan Buckley, returning to manage the family business, one which is tied up with multiple dueling drug cartels, as well as unreliable family members and at least one (Supergirl's Melissa Benoist) who's looking to escape her own legal problems by working with the FBI against her father and brother. Stream The Waterfront on Netflix.\n\nA vibe match that, while it doesn't replicate Landman's family and business drama, still runs with the neo-western feel that defines a Taylor Sheridan show. Michael Dorman stars as Joe Pickett, a Wyoming game warden with a violent past and, well, a violent present too. Dorman's Pickett is less of a tough action hero type, and more of a likable, everyday guy who just happens to be wrapped up in a murder via his day job. It’s not a comedy, but is definitely a bit weirder and more surreal than the more literal style of something like Landman, which lacks flourishes like Pickett's memorable emu wrestling scene. Stream Joe Pickett on Paramount+.\n\nAnother intense family business drama with a dash of a succession crisis: In Queen Sugar, three largely estranged siblings in distant cities are brought together by the death of their father, who has left them each an equal share in an 800-acre sugarcane farm in rural Louisiana. The Ava DuVernay-produced (and sometimes directed) series offers plenty of scandal and soapy drama, but ultimately, it’s a show about a family coming back together to preserve its legacy. The siblings (Rutina Wesley, Dawn-Lyen Gardner, and Kofi Siriboe) are a bit less gritty and troubled than the Norris family (they're mostly trying to do the right thing), but they still generate enough drama to fuel seven successful seasons. Stream Queen Sugar on Hulu.\n\nThe popularity of Taylor Sheridan-esque neo-westerns leads us, inevitably, to something closer to an actual western. In this series, adapting Philipp Meyer's 2013 Pulitzer Prize-finalist novel of the same name, Pierce Brosnan plays Eli McCullough, a ruthless cattle baron making moves to get in on the burgeoning oil industry in the Rio Grande Valley of 1915. A parallel narrative sees Eli as a young man, kidnapped and raised among a Nʉmʉnʉʉ family. While his backstory lends the character welcome complexity, in the present, he's as determined to build his empire as he is to prepare his son and grandson to take over when he's gone. Stream The Son on Prime Video and AMC+.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only “for cause,” which is often interpreted to mean neglect of duty or malfeasance.\n\nLast year, the court allowed President Donald Trump to fire — at least temporarily — Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but it carved out a distinction for the Fed. The two officials had argued that if Trump could fire them, he could also fire members of the Fed’s board of governors.\n\n“We disagree,” the court said then. “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”\n\nThat is now being put to the test in a case in front of the Supreme Court involving Trump's attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job.\n\nAllowing Cook’s firing to go forward “would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three Trump appointees on the nation’s highest court.\n\nBut the court largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?\n\nSeveral legal experts say the justices are on shaky ground. The Fed, they argue, is similar in many ways to the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, agencies Congress intended to be independent but whose officials Trump has been able to fire without pushback from the high court.\n\n“There’s no historical grounds for distinguishing the Fed from other independent agencies that Congress has designed,” said Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University. “The whole argument was premised on the idea that the Fed is different. They haven’t explained exactly why.”\n\nPeter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, added, “I’ll say as a legal scholar and as a historian I think that differentiation is hocus pocus.”\n\nJust last month, the court signaled in a separate oral argument that it would likely allow Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The conservative majority on the court also suggested it would overturn a 90-year-old precedent that sharply limited the president's ability to fire top officials at independent agencies.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and many of his colleagues support the “unitary executive\" theory, which holds that the president should have full sway over the staffing of agencies in the executive branch.\n\nAgency directors, like Slaughter, “are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries” without being accountable to anyone, Kavanaugh said at the December oral argument.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve, however, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have applied a different view: that the Fed’s monetary policy — the setting of short-term interest rates and management of the money supply — historically hasn’t been overseen by the executive branch.\n\nSome legal experts have likewise drawn a distinction between the Fed and other independent agencies. In a brief filed in the Cook case, Aaron Nielson, a law professor at the University of Texas, and formerly a top lawyer in Texas government, wrote that, “Whereas the modern FTC indisputably exercises executive power, the Fed's core function is monetary policy, which need not and often does not require executive power.\"\n\nThe First and Second Banks of the United States were nationwide banks that were the closest the United States had to a central bank in the first few decades after the nation's founding, and both “conducted early monetary policy,\" Nielson wrote, but weren't executive branch agencies.\n\nBut Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed, argued that the Fed does exercise executive power when it regulates the banking system. And monetary policy, when it adjusts the money supply, is part of that regulation, he said.\n\nThere are also only three types of government authority, Menand argues: legislative, executive, and judicial, and the Fed belongs in the executive category.\n\n“There is no fourth type of government power,” Menand said. \"There is no other place to locate the Fed.”\n\nStill, the justices mostly avoided addressing why the Fed is different during Wednesday's oral argument, in part, Menand noted, because neither side pushed it. Cook's lawyers had no reason to question a distinction that appeared to favor them.\n\nAnd even the government's own top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, acknowledged that Trump could only fire Cook “for cause,” while in the other cases the White House had sought to remove officials for any reason, including policy differences. The distinction made it harder for the White House to argue that Cook should immediately be removed from office.\n\n“There is a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of executive influence,\" Sauer said. “And we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing.”\n\nPaul Clement, one of Cook's lawyers, told the justices, “it’s kind of why this case is, I think, problematic for the government because they could have come in here and said, you know, Fed, schmed, it’s not that different. This is just like the FTC.”\n\nInstead, Clement added, “they come in and say, no, we’re going to accept that the Fed is different, at least for purposes of this case.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court will initially rule on the narrow question of whether Cook can remain in her position while the larger dispute over her firing is fought in the lower courts. Still, at some point it may have to issue more comprehensive rulings that could include a fuller explanation of why the justices see the Fed as different.\n\nFor now, the Fed's size and impact on the financial markets may be offering it a measure of protection.\n\n“I don’t mean to denigrate any other agency, but there’s a reason that monetary policy has been treated differently, for lo these many years,” Clement said. “And there’s a reason that the markets watch the Fed a little more closely than they watch really any other agency of government.”",

    "title": "How to Survive a Massive Winter Storm",
    "description": "Rule number one: stay inside.",
    "fullText": "With a historically bad winter storm expected to bring snow, ice, and sub-zero wind chills to many parts of the United States this weekend, it's a good time to make sure you're prepared for a potentially life-threatening disaster.\n\nWhile winter storms are generally less deadly than hurricanes and heat waves, they can be extremely dangerous, particularly when extremely cold, wind, and ice storms cause power outages. But with a little preparation and common sense, you should be all right when it gets extra snowy and cold. Here are some tips and instructions for blizzard and winter storm survival.\n\nThe map above, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center shows the predicted course of the storm through Jan. 26. You can click the link to dig into predicted snow amounts, ice accumulation, and more, but the overall picture is a huge storm that is likely to affect more than 172 million people in the U.S. and bring record low temperatures. If you're anywhere in the affected area, take time to plan for a potential snow-and-cold disaster before it happens.\n\nFor a winter storm, you want to prepare for a few cold days without power. You should have a basic survival bag tucked away in an easy-to-access spot in your house for any disaster. According to the government, a boilerplate emergency kit will contain:\n\nWater and non-perishable food for several days\n\nExtra cell phone battery or charger\n\nBattery-powered or hand crank radio that can receive NOAA Weather Radio tone alerts and extra batteries\n\nDust mask to help filter contaminated air, and plastic sheeting and duct tape to shelter in place\n\nMoist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties for personal sanitation\n\nNon-sparking wrench or pliers to turn off utilities\n\nCan opener (if your kit contains canned food)\n\nExtra clothing and blankets (although I bet you already know where these are in your home)\n\nFor winter storm saftey, I'd add a carbon monoxide detector, just to be as safe as possible when shut up inside your house. Here’s a handy shopping list you can take to the supermarket, complete with “extra credit” items like prescriptions medicine and games to keep you busy.\n\nIf you only follow one rule for blizzard survival, make it this one: Do not be outside during a winter storm. If you’re home, you probably won’t be snowbound for more than a week (and even that is unlikely), and you’ll be much warmer than if you were outside.\n\nIf you are home during a blizzard or winter storm (and you should be) take the following steps:\n\nDon’t forget your pets. Bring them inside, too.\n\nBe able to access multiple sources of information about the weather, from the internet, to television, to radio, and make sure you can get updates even if the power goes out.\n\nIf you have electric heat, crank it up as the storm approaches in case you lose power.\n\nStay in a small, insulated area: To conserve heat, stay in one room as much as possible.\n\nStuff towels and rags under doors to conserve heat.\n\nBe careful with alternative heaters like kerosene. They can start a fire, and if not properly ventilated, you can die from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nCover windows at night but uncover them during day to catch any heat from sunlight.\n\nSave batteries: Use your phone to check in on friends, family and neighbors by or to call authorities only.\n\nAs cold weather approaches, you may hear difference kinds of buzzwords for approaching storms on your NOAA weather radio and from other sources. Here’s a crash course on the relevant winter weather warnings from the National Weather Service, and what they mean, with the most severe listed first.\n\nA warning indicates an 80% or greater probability of conditions that pose a threat to life or property, and that travel will become difficult to impossible. In other words: “This storm is serious business.”\n\nBlizzard Warning: A blizzard warning means that the following conditions are occurring or expected within the next 12 to 18 hours: Snow and/or blowing snow reducing visibility to 1/4 mile or less for three hours or longer, and sustained winds of 35 mph or greater or frequent gusts to 35 mph or greater.\n\nWinter Storm Warning: A winter storm warning is issued when a significant combination of hazardous winter weather is occurring or imminent. That means five inches or more of snow/sleet within a 12-hour period or seven inches or more of snow/sleet within a 24-hour period, and/or enough ice accumulation to cause damage to trees or power lines. It also can mean a life-threatening or damaging combination of snow and/or ice accumulation with wind.\n\nWatches are intended to provide enough lead time so you can make plans to stay safe. They are usually issued a day or so before the predicted event when there’s a greater than 50% chance of it happening.\n\nWinter Storm Watch: A winter storm watch is issued when there is the potential for significant and hazardous winter weather within 48 hours. This doesn’t mean that significant and hazardous winter weather will occur—it only means it is possible.\n\nBlizzard Watch: This means conditions are favorable for a blizzard event—low visibility with winds of at least 35 mph.\n\nWinter storm advisories indicate that less serious (but still concerning) weather conditions are possible. Remember, though, a storm can change from one condition to another, so keep checking back. Go to the National Weather Service’s site for more in-depth weather-warning information.\n\nBeing trapped in your car during a snow-mergency is bad, but not necessarily deadly. Here’s a detailed trapped-in-your-car survival guide, but here are the main points:\n\nDon’t panic: As survival scenarios go, being trapped in a car in a snowstorm is not that bad. It definitely beats being trapped in a snowstorm without a car.\n\nMake sure your tailpipe is not clogged: When you first realize you are trapped, check the exhaust pipe to make sure it’s clear. You don’t want to die of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nIndicate you are in distress to the outside world: Call 911 if you can. Tie a brightly colored cloth or ribbon to your antenna or door. If the snow stops, raise your hood.\n\nStay in your vehicle: A car is an excellent survival shelter—a guy in Sweden survived in his car for two months, and he didn’t even seem to have had food or water. It is a bad idea to go walking around in a blizzard. You will get lost, cold, wet, and maybe even hit by another driver.\n\nBundle up: Wear as many layers as you can with the extra clothing you packed.\n\nCreate as small a space as possible: If you have blankets or jackets, create a little “fort” for yourself. A smaller space is easier to heat. You could try lining the windows with newspaper or those discarded fast food bags you never cleaned up.\n\nRun your car for 10 minutes an hour: Experts recommend starting your car and running the heater, hazard lights, and dome light for about 10 minutes per hour. Roll down the window a crack while the engine is running to avoid the possibility of inhaling carbon monoxide. Other than cold, carbon monoxide is your biggest danger.\n\nDon’t play on your phone: I know it’s boring to sit in the car for so long, but only use your cell to call emergency numbers. Don’t be surprised if the authorities tell you to “sit tight,” though.\n\nIf you run out of water, drink melted snow: You can get a little moisture into your body by drinking melted snow.\n\nSo you didn’t listen when I said to stay home, huh? Now you’re stumbling blindly through a snowstorm and freezing to death. I won’t sugar coat it: things are bad for you, and your survival depends on the severity of the storm. But here’s what to do:\n\nFind shelter: Get out of the wind and snow. Don’t try to make it home or wherever else you’re going if there’s somewhere safe you can wait things out.\n\nCover up your exposed flesh: I imagine this would occur to you anyway, but just in case it doesn’t, cover up as much as possible to stay warm and avoid frostbite.\n\nBuild a shelter: The National Weather Service recommends the following if you can’t find a shelter: “Build a lean-to, windbreak, or snow cave for protection from the wind. Build a fire for heat and to attract attention. Place rocks around the fire to absorb and reflect heat.” I think they’re being very optimistic. During a serious blizzard, like Minnesota’s “Children’s Blizzard” of 1888, people died yards from their houses because they got disoriented and snow-blind, so you’re probably not going to have time to build an igloo or whatever in a real blizzard. But learn wilderness survival tactics if you are likely to be at risk.\n\nMelt snow for water: Melting snow for water is OK, but don’t eat it frozen—that will lower your body temperature.",

    "title": "Google Chrome Is About to Drop Support for These Macs",
    "description": "If you have an older Mac, your time with Chrome may be ending.",
    "fullText": "Nothing lasts forever, and technology is no exception. As shiny and new as your computer was when you first bought it, eventually, developers will drop support for it. There's no telling when exactly, but at some point, you'll open an app to find a message that reads something like: \"This device does not support the latest version of this app. Please update your hardware.\"\n\nThat goes for Macs, as well. You might forget that fact, since Apple's computers tend to stick around for a long time. But inevitably, the shadow of end-of-life policies comes for them, too. If you're still rocking an older Mac, I have some bad news, specifically if you use Chrome: Google is officially planning its last supported version of the browser.\n\nGoogle quietly announced the news in a post on the Chrome Platform Status site. The company confirmed that Chrome 150 will be the last version of the browser to support macOS 12, otherwise known as macOS Monterey. Once Google eventually releases Chrome 151, users on macOS 12 will not be able to install it, and will forever be stuck on Chrome 150. Google hasn't said when Chrome 150 will actually drop (we're currently on Chrome 143), but MacRumors estimates it'll be sometime in mid-2026, based on past releases.\n\nBefore you panic, know there are a couple caveats here. First, Chrome will not stop working on macOS 12 once version 151 drops. You'll still be able to use Chrome as you always have. In fact, you might not even notice the difference, minus any new features and changes that Google rolls out in future software versions. You will see an alert that your browser is out of date, but it'll still get you to YouTube, Gmail, and Lifehacker.\n\nThis version of macOS is also fairly outdated. Google isn't just picking last year's macOS version, or the one before that. We're currently on macOS 26, which for these purposes, could be read as macOS 16. It's the fourth version of macOS since Monterey, meaning unless you know your Mac is running macOS 12, there's a good chance you're running something that Chrome still supports.\n\nIf you aren't sure, click the Apple in the top-left corner, then choose \"About This Mac.\" Here, you'll find the macOS version next to \"macOS.\"\n\nLet's say your Mac is running macOS 12. If so, you really should stop using Chrome once version 151 drops. That's because you'll no longer receive Google's latest security updates for the browser, which puts your machine (and its data) at risk.\n\nOnce Chrome 150 drops, bad actors will look for security vulnerabilities in the code to exploit. Google will do the same, and will patch any it or any third-party researchers find. Once 151 comes out, it'll include those patches, but Chrome 150 users will be left behind. The risk only grows as new vulnerabilities are discovered, and new versions of Chrome come out.\n\nAs such, you have a couple of options if you're running macOS 12. The first is to update your OS, if you have that choice. If your Mac does support macOS 13 or newer, updating will open you up to new versions of Chrome. Of course, perhaps the reason you're running macOS 12 is because you cannot update. While that largely affects Macs that are at least 10 years old, there are still plenty of these machines out there. There are alternative ways to update your older Mac, even if Apple won't let you, such as with OpenCore Legacy Patcher, but that might be too technical a route for some.\n\nThe other option here is to stop using Chrome, and switch to a browser that does support macOS 12. Firefox, for example, supports macOS 10.15 or later, and Microsoft Edge fully supports macOS 12 and later. (Safari itself hasn't been updated on macOS 12 since July 2024.)\n\nIt isn't fun watching your tech grow old, but you don't need to chuck your Mac just because Chrome will end support this year—even if the newest ones are really good.",

    "title": "Tesla Has Dropped This Basic Autopilot Feature, Forcing US Drivers Into Subscriptions",
    "description": "Other brands will continue to offer similar features at no extra cost.",
    "fullText": "If you're in the market for a new Tesla, your fancy new electric car is going to be a little less smart—unless you pony up for a subscription. According to reporting from Elektrek and buying experiences from drivers, the company is ditching the basic Autopilot mode that used to come standard in new vehicles, and is now pushing buyers to \n\nBefore, Autopilot consisted of two minor but helpful driving assist features. The first was Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which automatically adjusts speed based on the speed limit and surrounding cars, and the second was Autosteer, which helps keep you in the center of your lane. The idea was that, while highway driving, you could turn on Autopilot and essentially let your car drive itself (while still remaining attentive and aware, of course).\n\nNow, though, Autosteer will only be available as part of a Full Self-Driving, or FSD, subscription. Traffic Aware Cruise Control will still come standard on new vehicles, but highway drivers who aren't paying Tesla a monthly fee will now need to make tiny corrections every once in a while to keep from veering into the wrong lane.\n\nMaking its cars dumber by default is an odd move for a company that wants to be seen as cutting-edge, although if removing Autopilot encourages more FSD subscriptions, that would see more users with Tesla's most-advanced self-driving tech on the road. Unfortunately, that goal will be pretty costly for consumers. A Full Self-Driving subscription currently costs $99 per month, although until Feb. 14, you are able to buy a lifetime FSD subscription for $8,000.\n\nWhich features you'd get with an FSD sub depends on what's legally available in your area, but in addition to bringing back Autosteer, upgrading could also net you assistance with parking, pickups, and lane changes. However, if all you want is to get your basic functionality back, disgruntled drivers are pointing out that the discontinued features continue to be offered standard on lower-cost models from competing brands, like Toyota.\n\nThe move to push Full Self-Driving subscriptions also comes alongside a promise from Tesla owner Elon Musk that pricing for the feature will go up as it improves, although the statement seemed to mostly focus on hopes of a future unsupervised FSD mode rather than more minor upgrades.\n\nAt any rate, it's getting more expensive to buy a Tesla that lives up to the futuristic dreams the marketing promises. The company does still offer a slightly less expensive $6,000 \"Enhanced Autopilot\" add-on in some international regions, which combines the features from basic Autopilot with a few FSD features, but North American customers will now have no choice but to subscribe.",

    "fullText": "The family of a homeless man who died after a bulldozer crushed his tent last year during an encampment sweep filed a lawsuit Friday against the nonprofits involved in clearing the encampment, the second lawsuit they filed over his death.\n\nThe lawsuit says Partners for HOME and SafeHouse Outreach are partly responsible for Taylor's death because employees did not check whether Taylor, 46, was in his tent before a bulldozer was deployed to clear it, flattening his tent while he was in it and leaving blood on the street.\n\nTaylor lived in an encampment on Old Wheat Street in Atlanta, which city officials asked to clear ahead of celebrations for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday last January. The encampment was near Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King had preached and now the site of annual events to honor him.\n\nPartners for HOME is the city's lead agency on homelessness. SafeHouse Outreach is another Atlanta nonprofit that serves unhoused people. The lawsuit says the organizations should have known to check Taylor's tent after they did outreach at the site in advance.\n\nCathryn Vassell, CEO of Partners for HOME, said the nonprofit cannot comment on the lawsuit because they have not seen it but “is committed to its mission making homelessness in Atlanta rare, brief and nonrecurring.\" SafeHouse Outreach did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTaylor's family sued the city of Atlanta in July, alleging city employees also should have checked whether Taylor was in his tent.\n\nTaylor’s death sparked outrage among local advocates and neighbors at the encampment who at the time called the city’s policies on clearing encampments inhumane. They said the city faces a dire affordable housing shortage that makes it inevitable that people will end up living on the streets.\n\nRight after Taylor’s death, the city put a temporary moratorium on encampment sweeps. With the FIFA World Cup coming to Atlanta this Summer, the city has since resumed clearing encampments with the goal of eliminating all homelessness in the downtown area before then. Partners for HOME is close to its goal of housing 400 people ahead of the World Cup, said Vassell.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Friday seeks unspecified damages as well as compensation for medical and hospital bills, burial costs, attorney’s fees and litigation costs.\n\nHarold Spence, one of the lawyers representing the family, said at a news conference Friday that city officials and the nonprofit employees didn’t want the “dignitaries” attending the Martin Luther King Jr. event to see the encampment.\n\n“They were in a rush to remove it,” Spence said. “Unfortunately, it turned out they were willing to remove it at any cost.”\n\nSpence added that Taylor had recently secured a job and was ready to “turn his life around.”\n\nKramon is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "description": "That clickbait title might have been written by AI.",
    "fullText": "Last month, Google told online publishers that it had started testing AI-generated headlines in Google Discover, replacing stories' carefully handcrafted titles with truncated alternatives made up by Gemini. Some journalists were predictably unhappy, but now, the company says that the AI headlines are no longer an experiment—they're a \"feature.\"\n\nBack when the testing began, the results ranged from poorly worded to straight up misinformation. For instance, one AI-generated headline promised \"Steam Machine price revealed,\" when the original article made no such claim. Another said \"BG3 players exploit children,\" which sounds serious, until you click through to the article and see that it's about a clever way to recruit invincible party members in Baldur's Gate 3 (which, to be fair, does involve turning child NPCs into sheep at one point).\n\nAt the time, Google said that the test was a \"small UI experiment for a subset of Discover users,\" and simply rearranged how users saw AI previews, which were introduced in October of last year and feature short AI summaries of articles, including an occasional AI headline. However, while that AI headline was previously hidden below the original, authored headline, the test put it up top, while getting rid of the authored headline entirely.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like Google might have been willing to back away from the AI headlines, but now the company says it's doubling down. In a statement to The Verge, Google said that its AI headlines are no longer in testing, but are now a full-fledged feature. The company didn't elaborate on why, but did say that the update \"performs well for user satisfaction.\"\n\nWhen 9to5Google then reached out for more detail, the publication was told, \"The overview headline reflects information across a range of sites, and is not a rewrite of an individual article headline.\"\n\nWell, that hasn't quite been the case for me: When I first wrote about this \"experiment,\" I actually had yet to run into one of the AI headlines. But perusing my Google Discover feed today (to see yours, swipe right from the home screen on an Android phone, or scroll down in the Google app), I've finally seen some first hand. To Google's credit, these AI previews do seem to synthesize several sources as claimed—you can see them above the linked story. However, they still call out one article in particular, linking to it and using its header photo. That can easily lead users to think the AI generated headline was written by the linked publication.\n\nThat can have consequences for the publication or writer if the AI gets something wrong, which a disclaimer at the bottom of these AI previews admits can happen. For instance, The Verge said it saw an AI Discover headline on a story from Lifehacker's sister site PCMag that said, \"US reverses foreign drone ban,\" even though the linked story goes out of its way to say headlines that claim this are \"misleading.\"\n\nThe AI headlines I've seen personally haven't been quite that bad, but as someone with a more than decade-long career in journalism, I do question their helpfulness. For instance, \"Starfleet Academy full of Trek Nods\" is much less informative than the original, \"One of TNG's Strangest Species Is Getting a Second Life In Modern Star Trek.\" I guess \"Star Trek show has Star Trek things\" is apparently clickier or more useful to the reader than just saying what the specific Star Trek thing is?\n\nAnother example: \"Anbernic unveils RG G01 Controller.\" I hope you know what those letters and numbers mean, because this AI headline completely buries the context in the original headline, \"Anbernic's New Controller Has a Screen and Built-In Heartbeat Sensor, for Some Reason.\"\n\nI guess this is a future that I'll have to get used to though. That I'm starting to see these headlines myself, despite not being part of the initial experiment, does suggest we can expect them to stick around, and to roll out to more people. If you see something that seems questionable while scrolling Google Discover, the feature has probably rolled out to you now too.\n\nTo check whether that suspicious headline was written by a human or not, try clicking the \"See more\" button at the bottom of the article's description and looking for a \"Generated with AI\" disclaimer.\n\nOn the plus side, only about half of the articles in my Google Discover are currently using AI headlines, so not every piece of \"content\" is being affected. But for journalists, the move still comes at a tough time: According to Reuters, Google traffic from organic search was down by 38% on test sites in the United Stated between November 2024 and November 2025, and while Google Discover isn't Search, editors write headlines the way they do for a reason. Using a robot to overwrites those decisions probably isn't the best way to tackle eroding trust in media.\n\nI've reached out to Google for comment on its AI headlines and will provide an update when I hear back.",

Are we ending next season? Are we even going to have the players to have a season, because we have a lot of players out of contract.\n\n\"Who's going to want to sign for us? Knowing they might not be here at the end of that following season.\"\n\nThe Ospreys have produced Wales and British and Irish Lions internationals like Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Biggar, Adam Jones, Shane Williams and Justin Tipuric and attracted star names like Justin Marshall, Tommy Bowe, Jerry Collins, Marty Holah and Ryan Jones.\n\nThey are the most successful Welsh team in terms of silverware since the inception of regional rugby in 2003, although their last trophy was in 2012.\n\nAn illustrious past.

With a score seeming likely, instead the ball popped out and Rio Dyer gathered before racing away from danger.\n\nJust three minutes later, Dragons made the most of the escape with a well-worked try from deep as Tinus de Beer chased and caught his own kick before putting Richards across.\n\nLeading 20-7 with 28 minutes remaining, Dragons' will have felt a first league win outside of Wales since October 2021 was there for the taking.\n\nBut with Coombes emerging from the bench as a replacement for Kleyn, it was Munster who instead ended their own unwanted winless streak.\n\nThe 28-year-old was perhaps fortunate that Hollie Davidson's on-field decision had been to award a try when replays of the grounding of his first score in the 57th minute appeared inconclusive.\n\nThere was no doubt about his second, however, from similarly close range with the score and subsequent conversion bringing Munster back within a point with 15 minutes to go.\n\nThe comeback was complete 10 minutes later as Tony Butler's straightforward penalty from in front of the posts gave Munster their first lead of the game.\n\nTwice Munster would take aim for the corner in the closing stages but one effort was kicked dead while a second, from a brilliant 50:22, led only to a line-out that saw them held up over the line.\n\nInstead, four points would be their reward from a night when Clayton McMillan's side again failed to convince.\n\nMunster: Haley; Abrahams, Kelly, Nankivell, Daly; Hanrahan, Coughlan; Loughman, D Barron (C), Ala'alatoa, Kleyn, F Wycherley, S Edogbo, Quinn, Gleeson.\n\nReplacements: L Barron, J Wycherley, Jager, O'Connell, Coombes, Patterson, Butler, Kilgallen.\n\nDragons: O'Brien; Richards, Inisi, Owen, Dyer; de Beer, Hope; Martinez, Coghlan, Hunt, Douglas, Carter, Keddie, Beddall, Wainwright.\n\nReplacements: Burrows, Morris, Dlamini, S Davies, Lewis-Hughes, R Williams, Ackerman, C Evans.",

Many of the posts appeared in his feed twice in a row.\n\nTrump, 79, began his posting spree by claiming he had helped to save TikTok by announcing the Chinese social media company would now operate in the U.S. under a majority American-owned joint venture.\n\nRepublican megadonor Larry Ellison’s company Oracle will hold a 15 percent stake in TikTok U.S. Ellison, a close friend of Trump, will also steer Oracle’s “retraining” of TikTok’s trademark algorithm.\n\n“It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”\n\nIronically, Trump had tried to ban TikTok in 2020, citing national security fears, but used the Chinese-owned app to broaden his appeal with younger voters during his 2024 election campaign.\n\nTrump’s dump of posts covered everything from a trailer for wife Melania’s Amazon documentary to reposting video from Fox News and Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nThere were also clips of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and uploaded PDF printouts of a NewsMax cover story on Trump from December.\n\nThe president also shared negative posts towards his political foes, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHis feed was also filled with doubled-up posts about the 2020 election being stolen, clips from UFC boss Dana White, and claims that he is having success with his handling of the American economy—despite polls suggesting otherwise.\n\nHe also shared content from a fan account dedicated to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Unfortunately for Trump, one of the posts read “American is back!!!” rather than “America is back!!!”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s post-midnight Truth Social onslaught follows an earlier social media frenzy from Europe. He spent more than an hour firing off posts attacking his critics and sharing gushing posts after the embarrassment of world leaders snubbing his “Board of Peace” signing ceremony.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nHe included more conspiracy theories about the 2020 election fraud as well as questionable claims about ICE being allowed to use force against Minnesota protesters.",

Atkinson, Edwards-Giraud Cons: Barton 3\n\nTries: Hennessey, Frost, Pepper, Russell Cons: Russell 2 Pens: Russell 2\n\nFinn Russell scored 15 points including two late penalties as Bath's late surge confined Gloucester to a ninth Prem loss in a fiercely fought derby contest.\n\nThe Cherry and Whites had led from early in the first-half to the 72nd minute when Russell's two penalties kicked Bath four points clear and to the top of the table ahead of the rest of the weekend's matches.\n\nGloucester still came away with two bonus points and surely much confidence, scoring tries through Val Rapava-Ruskin, Charlie Atkinson and Seb Atkinson after Louie Hennessey's opening score for Bath.\n\nDan Frost and Guy Pepper closed the gap to two at the break and while Afolabi Fasogbon kept the hosts in front, Russell's try and kicks from the tee saw Bath take the spoils once again in their long-standing west country rivalry.\n\nGloucester were clear underdogs coming in with their only league win against Harlequins on 29 November.\n\nAnd when former Cherry and Whites back Santiago Carreras skipped past a tackle allowing space to open and Hennessey ran over, it suggested a long night ahead for the home fans.\n\nYet Gloucester stood up to the challenge of the reigning champions and more, responding well as Rapava-Ruskin barrelled through two players and over to draw level.\n\nAfter two strong performances at fly-half during the Champions Cup, George Skivington stuck with versatile Charlie Atkinson at 10 and he continued to thrive in the role, even picking up the ball after Josiah Edwards-Giraud charged through and taking the opportunity to score under the posts.\n\nAlongside Tomos Williams at nine and Seb Atkinson at 12, the midfield trio linked together sharply, combining for Seb Atkinson to dive into the corner and open a 14-point lead hours after being called up to England's Six Nations squad.\n\nBath created little but a couple of moments of Gloucester indiscipline allowed them back in.\n\nTwo penalties gave Bath two kicks to touch, two attacking line-outs and two tries as first Spencer steered hooker Frost to touch down and then Pepper drove over under a maul to make it 21-19 at the break.\n\nBoth sides had chances early in the second-half as Rapava-Ruskin was penalised for an obstruction as Gloucester thought they had a fourth and Edwards-Giraud made a try-saving tap-tackle on Frost at the other end.\n\nFasogbon finally gave Gloucester the bonus point score but five substitutes at once from Johann van Graan brought Bath renewed energy and they camped out on Gloucester's line.\n\nThe defence held firm as Bath went short, were held up and then knocked the ball on before Russell finally made the persistence count, pouncing on a loose ball to score - though his missed conversion kept Bath two points behind.\n\nBoth sides were reduced to 14 with Pepper first to the bin before Gloucester prop Ciaran Knight followed him yet Russell kicked the resulting penalty, and another four minutes later to wrap up a tight win.\n\nGloucester director of rugby George Skivington told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:\n\n\"I'm really proud, the emotion and effort they showed - we've been frustrated and angry and disappointed so far this year but we talked before the game about just show what we're about and showing the supporters how much we care, especially in a local derby.\n\n\"The frustration is with us very firmly so what they put out there tonight was outstanding.\n\n\"There was a couple of disallowed tries and one sloppy moment at the end of the game at the breakdown with us and that ends up being the small margins that cost us the win.\n\n\"Some of the boys in and among that team can really hold their heads up high.\"\n\nBath head of rugby Johann van Graan told BBC Radio Bristol:\n\n\"Respect to Gloucester, they brought it, but respect to our guys we pulled it through.\n\n\"Five points away from home after the block we've had, I'm very proud of them.\n\n\"I felt the last 20 minutes we dominated, I felt tactically we did well and I felt our power beat them in the end.\n\n\"We came up against a side that defended really well, the good thing is we created opportunities. Ultimately the pressure told and we got four tries and our five points.\"\n\nGloucester: Barton; Hathaway, Edwards-Giraud, S. Atkinson, Thorley; C.

This is something really, really special.\"\n\nUnderstandably the comments angered the Football Supporters' Association, which accused Infantino of making \"cheap jokes\" about England fans.\n\nThe terminology \"Brits\" may well have annoyed fans from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland too.\n\nA lot has been done to try to repair England's name at major tournaments after it hit one of its lowest points on the international stage at Euro 2000. That was after a long history of hooliganism.\n\nSo what do the World Cup statistics show? Was the lack of arrests in Qatar unusual?

    "description": "A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.  U.S.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ashley Royal found the government should have sued Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Atlanta, and not in a separate federal judicial district in Macon, where the secretary of state also has an office.\n\nRoyal dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, meaning the Justice Department can refile it. The department declined to comment Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department has now filed lawsuits against 24 states and the District of Columbia seeking voter information as part of its effort to collect detailed voting data, including dates of birth and driver’s license and Social Security numbers. A federal judge in California rejected the lawsuit against that state on privacy grounds, while a judge in Oregon has suggested he may dismiss the case there.\n\nThe Trump administration characterizes the lawsuits as an effort to ensure election security, and the Justice Department says the states are violating federal law by refusing to provide voter lists and information.\n\nRaffensperger has been the rare Republican to decline the demand, saying Georgia law prohibits the release of voters' confidential personal unless certain qualifications are met. Raffensperger argues the federal government hasn't met those conditions. He says he shared the public part of the voter roll and information about how Georgia removes ineligible or outdated registrations in December.\n\n“I will always follow the law and follow the Constitution,” Raffensperger said in a statement Friday. “I won't violate the oath I took to stand up for the people of this state, regardless of who or what compels me to do otherwise.”\n\nThe refusal to hand over the records has become an issue in Raffensperger's 2026 run for governor. Raffensperger in January 2021 famously refused a demand from President Donald Trump in a phone call to “find” enough votes to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s win in Georgia's 2020 presidential election. Many Trump-loving Republicans still hold a grudge against Raffensperger.\n\nThe issue flared just Thursday in a hearing by a state Senate committee where multiple Republican state senators slammed Raffensperger for failing to comply, saying he legally could do so. The committee voted along party lines to advance a resolution calling on Raffensperger to hand over the data and calling it the “latest example of a pattern of behavior by the secretary and his office to refuse oversight of his administration of Georgia’s elections.”\n\nState Sen. Randy Robertson, a Republican from Cataula who filed the resolution, said the dismissal is “frustrating” because even if the Justice Department refiles the lawsuit, the problem will take longer to resolve.\n\n“As public officials we all should participate in any investigation done by a law enforcement agency,” Robertson told The Associated Press Friday.\n\nRobertson is one of many Republican lawmakers backing Lt. Gov. Burt Jones over Raffensperger for the GOP governor nomination. Jones, who already has Trump's endorsement for governor, was one of 16 state Republicans who signed a certificate that Trump had won Georgia and declaring themselves the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has completely misunderstood what global warming means in a bonkers post on social media.\n\nThe U.S. is facing a potentially historically cold period, with the eastern two-thirds of the country expected to experience sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall, which could cause major disruption. For the president, that is proof enough that “global warming” is a hoax.\n\n“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States,” he said on Truth Social. “Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”\n\nIt is not entirely clear who he meant by “Environmental Insurrectionists.”\n\nThe world’s most powerful man has repeatedly shown he is apprehensive about the existence of climate change, championing fossil fuel policies and peddling conspiracy theories, despite an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that it poses a real and imminent threat.\n\nIt has long been public knowledge that the now-relegated term global warming does not mean that cold temperatures will not occur, but rather that the average temperature inside the Earth’s atmosphere will be higher, disrupting delicate environmental balances.\n\nThe term is now instead regarded as merely a part of the wider phenomenon of climate change.\n\nCold landmasses and warm waters in the Arctic are stretching the polar vortex, dragging cold air further south. When that cold air meets warm, moist southern air, it could cause heavy snow, PBS reports.\n\nOn its website, the American Red Cross said, “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur,” the Guardian reports.\n\nThe BBC reports that “cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York,” could be blanketed with snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the weather could “pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin.”\n\nThe storm is expected to reach as far west as New Mexico, with around 230 million people staring down the barrel of 20-degree temperatures as state governors declare emergencies across the country.\n\nTrump’s disregard for the environment is well-documented. On his first day back in the Oval Office last year, he gave an executive order called “Putting people over fish,” where he disregarded the endangered delta smelt as “an essentially worthless fish,” and demanded water from their habitat be taken to fight fires hundreds of miles away.\n\nHe has also waged a long-running war on wind turbines, claiming “windmills” are making whales crazy and killing bald eagles, a point he illustrated on social media by posting a picture of a dead falcon in Israel.\n\nIn September, he gave a speech to the United Nations, where he said climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”\n\nDuring the same speech, he said, “I have a little standing order in the White House,” he said. “Never use the word ‘coal’. Only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal’. Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”",

    "fullText": "For only so long can economic reality be denied in uncertain times until it becomes too obvious to continue postponing, especially when the consequences affect millions of consumers. If it feels like something fundamental has shifted at Amazon, that's because it has.\n\nFor more than three decades, Amazon has been a dependable source of fast delivery and affordable prices. But recently, a key aspect of its business has come under pressure from forces beyond its control.\n\nIn July 2025, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy downplayed concerns about tariffs during an earnings call, calling media reports about their impact on retail prices and consumption \"wrong and misreported,\" stating that it was too early to draw conclusions.\n\n\"We haven't yet seen diminishing demand, nor price is meaningfully appreciating,\" said Jassy. \"We also have such diversity of sellers in our marketplace, over 2 million sellers in total, with different strategies of whether to pass on higher cost to consumers, the customers are advantaged shopping at Amazon because they're more likely to find lower prices on the items they care about.\"\n\nHowever, six months later, Jassy's tone has shifted. Now, he is warning consumers of an unfortunate reality.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Jassy acknowledged that while consumers remain resilient and continue spending, their behavior has changed. Shoppers are actively seeking bargains, leading to slower sales of higher-priced discretionary items.\n\nAt the same time, consumers are buying more everyday essentials thanks to Amazon's continued investments in faster delivery. However, these products are necessary goods that people will keep buying even if prices rise.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of tariffs, Amazon did extensive pre-buying in early 2025, allowing it to hold prices steady longer than many competitors. With its global network of warehouses and distribution centers, the company was able to import and store goods in bulk ahead of anticipated cost increases.\n\nBut that extra supply ran out in the fall.\n\nWhile some of its third-party sellers have chosen to absorb the higher costs to maintain market share, others are passing them on to consumers, resulting in some price hikes.\n\n\"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items,\" he said. \"Some sellers are deciding that they’re passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between.\"\n\nJassy blamed U.S. tariffs as a primary driver of the price increases, as these have raised the cost of imported goods.",

    "description": "Denmark is retiring the iconic F-16 fighter jet fleet and is replacing it with a new high-tech jet. Here's everything you need to know.",
    "fullText": "After 46 years of service to the Royal Danish Air Force, Denmark has retired its fleet of F-16 fighter planes as of January 18, 2026. Denmark has used this versatile, but now obsolete, fighter plane since 1980, having bought a total of 77 of these aircraft. A farewell ceremony was held at Skrydstrup Air Base's Hangar 3, where four F-16s landed after performing one final flight over Danish soil. Pilots, technicians, and others who had worked with the F-16s greeted the invited guests, showing off these planes one last time.\n\nThe history of the F-16 starts in the early 1970s, when a group of General Dynamics aerospace analysts and engineers designed what would become the F-16. Dissatisfied with the trend of making fighter planes more difficult to maneuver and heavier than their predecessors, this group, known as the Lightweight Fighter Mafia, created something completely different.\n\nDenmark is replacing the last of its F-16 aircraft with the F-35A Lightning II fighter jet, which has been used by the Danes since the first ones arrived there in 2023. On the first of April 2025, Denmark's F-35s took over from its F-16s in NATO's Quick Reaction Alert mission. In total, the Danish Defense Ministry has bought a total of 43 F-35s, 27 of them ordered in 2016 plus 16 additional planes in 2025. The F-35A is a single-seat aircraft powered by a Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 engine with 40,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nDenmark's switch to a full fleet of F-35A Lightning IIs makes the Royal Danish Air Force the third air force in the world, after Norway in 2022 and the Netherlands in 2024, to consist entirely of fifth-generation fighter planes, all of them being F-35As. They have all replaced their obsolete fleets of F-16s with these cutting-edge, multirole fighters. The replacement process took as long as it did due to major delays in producing the F-35 for the various forces around the world.\n\nThe F-35, which comes in many variants with distinct features, is made in three different versions for various use cases. The F-35A, the version which the U.S. Air Force and Denmark uses, is designed for conventional takeoff and landing. The F-35B, made for the U.S. Marine Corps, has a short takeoff and vertical landing capability. The F-35C, produced for the U.S. Navy, is adapted for launching from and landing on the Navy's aircraft carriers.\n\nDenmark's fleet of F-16 fighter jets are going to two different locations. Even though these F-16s are quite old, with the first batch delivered in 1980, the Danes have not only maintained them very well, they have also modernized them over the years. These actions have helped to make these planes more suitable for sale than scrapping.\n\nOne group of F-16s will be donated to Ukraine, as part of the 19 planes Denmark agreed to donate to the Ukrainian Air Force in 2023. The first of the Danish F-16s, one of the many kinds of fighter jets Ukraine has, reached Ukraine in August 2024. Denmark has also pledged to support the costs associated with training of Ukrainian pilots in Denmark, as well as those required for the maintenance and operations of these planes after they reach Ukraine. The Ukrainian Air Force uses their F-16s primarily to defend the country against Russian drones and missiles, as well as for dropping precision-guided bombs to provide close air support.\n\nA total of 24 of Denmark's F-16s will be sold to Argentina, which has not had any supersonic fighters in its arsenal since the country retired its French Mirages back in 2015. The U.S. Government was heavily involved in this deal due to its export regulations. The Argentinian F-16 package also includes training, parts, and simulators, to ensure proper maintenance and operation of the Argentine Air Force's 'new' F-16s. The first six planes were delivered in December, with additional batches each year through 2028.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

A spokesperson for the agency says that the on-scene phase of the investigation is complete and a preliminary report is expected by next month.\n\nA final report is expected within one to two years.\n\nThe crash landing brought an abrupt end to a fun outing for the Toones and their close friends — the pilot and his wife – KSL reported.\n\nKory had started recording the flight on his cell phone and the video captured both him and Oaklee smiling.\n\nBut as the helicopter later began to spin out of the pilot’s control, careening to the ground, the dad dropped his phone, according to KSL.\n\nThe recording continued, and Demars was later able to listen to the audio that was captured before the helicopter crashed near Wolf Creek Campground.\n\n“Something you got to know about my dad is he’s a rock,” Demars told KSL. “Hearing him coach my sister through that and keep her calm, they both think they’re about to die, and he’s keeping her calm.”\n\nAt the end of the recording, Demars said she could hear Oaklee call out to their dad, “I’m alive. I’m alive. Dad, are you alive?”\n\n“He responded back and that was music to my ears,” Demars told the outlet. “I was just so happy to hear that they could talk.”\n\nNearby snowmobilers, one of whom was a nurse, witnessed the aircraft's descent and assisted the passengers until first responders arrived.\n\nKory is now healing from serious chest injuries, and his daughter hit her head, KSL reported.\n\nDemars credited the pilot for helping save everyone on board.\n\nAll four people are now out of the hospital, which she said is a “miracle,” KSL reported. Even so, her sister has a long recovery ahead of her, prompting Demars to launch a GoFundMe.\n\n“She works tirelessly to provide for herself and this head injury will prevent her from income for some time,” Demars wrote with the fundraiser. “The upcoming cost of her AirMed and medical bills are certainly stressful for her.”\n\nAs the family heals, they’re grateful they have more time together.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“The thing you experience when you think you’re about to die is you’re not thinking about your possessions,” Demars told KSL. “You’re thinking about people, your family, your friends, your loved ones.”\n\nShe added, “My dad expressed that that was what was running through his mind.\"",

    "description": "Instances such as this one are becoming more common across the globe.",
    "fullText": "This Florida man was taking his puppy out for a late-night bathroom break when he noticed a nearly eight-foot alligator making use of his pool.\n\nFox Weather reported on a video taken by Rob Emhoff that showcased a gator swimming around the family pool.\n\nThankfully, with a quick call to the state's wildlife control office, a professional alligator trapper was sent to the scene to safely remove the animal from the property.\n\nEmhoff was shocked, saying, \"I would never believe this if someone told me.\"\n\nIn the video, the trapper catches the gator with a snare, tapes its mouth shut, and drags it out of the pool.\n\nAlligators have an incredibly powerful bite but struggle to open their mouths with nearly the same strength, so wrapping tape thoroughly around the snout keeps their teeth out of commission.\n\nThrough careful, humane removal, the alligator was taken off the homeowners' property without any problems other than interrupted sleep.\n\nHowever, instances such as this one are becoming more common as habitat loss increases across the globe.\n\nThe family made the right choice to call in someone who knew exactly how to take the alligator out of their pool without hurting it. In the video, the gator seemed placid until it rolled viciously as it was removed from the pool.\n\nWhen people try to interfere with wildlife without professional involvement, they or the animal can be harmed. If that happens, the creature may have to be euthanized.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAs wildlife continue to lose places to live, they seek refuge in human-dominated spaces. This can lead to not-so-pleasant encounters between people and animals that can end badly for both parties.\n\nAnother Floridian wasn't so lucky with her own alligator encounter, pulling her puppy from harm's way and taking a few bites to the arm in the process. The gator, which had been occupying a creek near the woman's home, was put down.\n\nAs animals are forced to inhabit locations where humans have encroached on once pristine land, human-wildlife interactions become more of an issue.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that approaching or handling wild animals, especially when those animals are in unfamiliar territories, puts everyone involved at risk.\n\nThus, knowing who to call is a key component to keeping humans and animals safe. It is always best to contact authorities, as they know the proper procedures to follow to keep everyone protected.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",
