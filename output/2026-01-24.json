    "fullText": "FC Augsburg’s players and their coach were still soaking in the disbelief and joy following their stunning 2‑1 win over Bayern Munich.\n\nRobin Fellhauer summed up the mood: “We had to believe in ourselves. Nobody believed in us, so we had to do it ourselves. We wanted to play well, force a bit of luck, and then make the most of it. We can hardly believe it - it’s an incredible feeling, and it’s only just sinking in in the locker room.”\n\nMidfielder Elvis Rexhbecaj praised the team’s defensive effort, which laid the foundation for their triumph. “Defensively, we were outstanding today,” he said. “Everyone enjoyed defending - it was a joy to be part of it.”\n\nHead coach Manuel Baum highlighted both the performance and the mentality behind the result. “An outstanding outcome, and the lads deserved it,” he said. “I was convinced the players would have to earn the belief that they could have a chance against Bayern. We wanted to create a day we will remember for years, and I think we’ve achieved that. Simply a fantastic performance from the guys, and I’m very proud.”\n\nThe voices from Augsburg’s camp underline the combination of belief, discipline, and sheer determination that fueled one of the Bundesliga’s most dramatic upsets this season.",

They were replaced by Tietie Tuimauga - making his Saracens debut - and experienced Argentina international Juan Martin Gonzalez.\n\nAnd those late changes seemed to unsettle the hosts as Newcastle grabbed an early advantage when Alex Hearle's break helped set up 21-year-old lock Oscar Usher to crash over for the visitors.\n\nNewcastle made a blistering start to the match and should have extended their lead but, inexplicably, Tom Christie failed to dot the ball down after going behind the in-goal area, with Sarries scrum-half Charlie Bracken forcing him out of touch.\n\nThat moment woke Saracens up and they levelled through a penalty try when Newcastle scrum-half Simon Benitez Cruz was adjudged to have deliberately knocked-on in front of his own line, meaning he also spent 10 minutes in the bin.\n\nSaracens wing Rotimi Segun then put his side's untidy first 15 minutes to bed when his wonderful chip and run took him past the Newcastle defence and dot down in the left corner.\n\nCaluori – who was left out of England's 36-man squad for this year's Six Nations yesterday – then got on the end of a deft kick from full-back Elliot Daly to open up a two-score lead.\n\nAfter Andy Onyeama-Christie had a try disallowed because of a knock-on in the build-up, Caluori got his second when he ran a beautiful line to meet a Daly pass before scoring in what is quickly becoming trademark fashion.\n\nWith Newcastle wing Elliott Obatoyinbo in the sin-bin after being shown a yellow card for offside a minute before half-time, Onyeama-Christie did eventually get his name on the scoresheet a minute after the interval when he juggled a short pass before dotting down under the sticks.\n\nCaluori then completed his hat-trick inside 43 minutes when Sarries moved the ball smartly from left to right to force an overload which resulted in a simple finish for the teenager.\n\nAt that stage, the hosts were turning on the style and, off the bench, James Hadfield dotted down after a successful Saracens maul.\n\nFijian Eroni Mawi then got the half-century up for Saracens when he crashed over from a metre out, before Hadfield claimed his second with a pick-and-drive from close range under the sticks.\n\nA Nick Tompkins kick downfield was then beautifully collected one-handed by Caluori who raced clear to dot down in the right corner for his fourth.\n\nTompkins then grabbed Saracens' eleventh and final try before Newcastle's Reuben Parsons, making his Prem debut, had the final word when he touched down with the final act of the day.\n\nSaracens: Daly; Caluori, Lozowski, Tompkins, Segun; Farrell (capt), C.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJa Morant is going to miss some time for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nOn Saturday, the team announced that Morant is officially dealing with a UCL sprain in his left elbow. He suffered it against the Atlanta Hawks, which marked just his second game back on January 21. The Grizzlies are going to evaluate Morant again in three weeks.\n\nJust because he’ll get evaluated then, doesn’t mean he’s guaranteed to return. While nobody can say Morant will be healed up in under a month, injury analyst Jeff Stotts has good news on Morant, based on history with NBA players dealing with a UCL-related injury.\n\nVia @InStreetClothes: New Ja Morant Injury Update: Elbow UCL injuries are commonplace in baseball (think Tommy John) but not in the NBA. Average missed time lost for a mild to moderate UCL elbow sprain? ~11. 8 games (~22 days).\n\nMorant’s re-evaluation timeline comes right around the league’s All-Star break. It seems there could be a high chance he won’t return to the court until after the break. The Grizzlies are set to wrap up a long road trip against the Denver Nuggets on February 11, which still falls under the timeline.\n\nThey return to the court on February 20 to host the Utah Jazz.\n\nThe Grizzlies don’t have a need to rush Morant back on the floor. This is just another setback for the star, who has struggled in all ways, including availability this year. At this point, the Grizzlies are 18-25 on the season, winning just three of their past 10 games.\n\nMemphis ranks 12th in the Western Conference, sitting right behind the Dallas Mavericks. While they are still hovering around the Play-In, there is still a lot of basketball left to be played.\n\nThe Grizzlies will take the floor again on Sunday for a 3:30 PM ET tip.",

It'd be the second consecutive year that he led in ERA.\n\nSkenes would be the youngest to lead his league in ERA in back-to-back seasons since it was an official stat in 1913, according to Langs.\n\nThat previous record is currently held by Clayton Kershaw.\n\nSkenes also could set a strikeout record.\n\n\"Skenes is also projected to lead the NL in strikeouts, with 237,\" Langs writes. \"He would be the fifth youngest to lead his league in both ERA and strikeouts by age at the end of the season, older than only 1985 Gooden (20 years, 324 days), 1940 Bob Feller (21 years, 331 days), 1965 Sam McDowell (23 years, 12 days) and 2011 Kershaw (23 years, 193 days).\"\n\nMORE: The Reds aren't signing any free agents because of TV\n\nThe key to the Pirates' season ahead really isn't Skenes, though.

My older brother, he got a degree at Santa Clara. My younger sister, who is a junior at Marquette, she’s still at her school. Now I’m here. My mom’s like, ‘It’s only right that you get your education and finish.’ I said, ‘Of course.’ So I’m happy.”\n\nBediako’s mom isn’t the only one who is happy to see the 23-year-old back in the classroom.\n\n“They have been very supportive. My brother has probably been the most excited. I would say he was probably the most excited. My sister, she was also happy. My mom was just happy as well. She was happy that I was happy. Especially just coming back to get a degree, a future education. Because basketball won’t always be there,” Bediako said.\n\n“The mind is everything.

    "fullText": "The 2023-24 UNC basketball team is one of the program's best teams to never win a championship. Complete with an experienced, talented roster that showcased immense chemistry, how the season ended was a disappointment.\n\nYou might recognize a few names on this roster: RJ Davis, Armando Bacot and Harrison Ingram. All three dabbled with the NBA. Davis and Ingram are currently in the G League, while Bacot is playing overseas.\n\nThe best pure shooter on that 2023-24 North Carolina roster, though, is Cormac Ryan. Transferring in from Notre Dame during the prior offseason, Ryan finished his lone season in Carolina Blue second in 3-point percentage (.354) and free throw percentage (.874).\n\nNow a member of the G-League's Wisconsin Herd, who are affiliated with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, Ryan is thriving in his second pro season.\n\nRyan is averaging 21.4 points per game on 50% field goal shooting, a 42% mark from deep and 90% mark from the free throw line.\n\nThe Herd are just 6-8 as of Saturday morning, but they have a true leader in Ryan. Question is: when will Milwaukee call Ryan up to make his NBA regular season debut?\n\nIt's no secret the 2025-26 Tar Heels could use Ryan's shooting prowess on their roster, particularly from the free throw line. UNC has its best frontcourt in years, led by Caleb Wilson and Henri Veesaar, but backcourt production is still coming into its own.\n\nThat 2023-24 North Carolina squad lost to Alabama in a heartbreaking, Sweet 16 result. Can the current Tar Heels make it a few steps deeper and bring a National Championship back to Chapel Hill?\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Cormac Ryan thriving in second season",

    "description": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander won't use OKC's injuries as excuse for loss to Indiana Pacers.",
    "fullText": "Getting past Andrew Nembhard with ease, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander went with the up-and-under move to finish through traffic for the driving layup in the final seconds. The bucket was the last of a monstrous outing that should've resulted in a win. And a game where OKC should've lived or died with the ball in his hands.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder couldn't survive their recent uptick of injuries in their 117-114 loss to the Indiana Pacers. We learned that you can't win a game when only three NBA players have positive contributions.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander finished with 47 points on 17-of-28 shooting, four assists and four rebounds. He shot 1-of-4 from 3 and went 12-of-12 on free throws. He also had a steal and a block.\n\nWell, if there was ever a game for Gilgeous-Alexander to empty the tank, it's this one. The Thunder didn't have any other viable on-ball scorer. That was painfully obvious in this game. Jalen Williams remains out. Ajay Mitchell and Aaron Wiggins also joined him as guys out.\n\nWhen Gilgeous-Alexander was on the floor, the offense flowed fine. Off, though, yeesh. Not enough Jaylin Williams DHO handoffs in the world could solve things. Those elements crafted a game where you saw the 30-point machine leave it all on the floor as a high-volume scorer.\n\nThe Pacers had no way to stop Gilgeous-Alexander. He knifed through their defense to get several looks. When that didn't happen, he got to his mid-range spots without any problem at the elbow and baseline. Indiana had to resort to fouling him as he was relentless at putting his head down and barreling towards the rim.\n\nNembhard has had some success over the years — better than most, at least — but it didn't matter. Gilgeous-Alexander was in the zone. He put up 29 points in the second half. He had 15 in the fourth quarter as he tried to play Superman and drag OKC to the finish line.\n\nInstead, Gilgeous-Alexander painted a masterpiece that ended up in waste. He almost proved that you could win an NBA game with one high-end scorer. The short-handed Thunder couldn't prop up enough help to make sure this performance stole headlines for the right reasons.\n\n\"No matter what, every team goes through injuries. No team has been 100% all year in the history of the game. Injuries are going to happen. It's about the next guy being able to play,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"We have a roster full of games that could, no matter what, come in and play.\"\n\nAnd then there was the final possession. In a vacuum, Isaiah Joe's outside look was fine. The sharpshooter knocks that down in his sleep. But I feel like the ball should've been in Gilgeous-Alexander's hands. Even if Indiana immediately doubles and refuses to concede a one-on-one perimeter look. Let the reigning MVP decide what to do next from there.\n\nThat's happened a couple of times in the final possession of close games. The Thunder have struggled to let Gilgeous-Alexander decide the final result. Even when he takes over fourth quarters like he did tonight. The Pacers failed to prove they couldn't stop him. So no reason to bail them out.\n\n\"Naturally, the ball is in my hands more because there's less playmakers out there. I'm pretty sure my usage rate has been higher the last two nights than I was averaging when we were completely healthy,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"Whatever the game calls for, I just plug in and do. If I need to be on it more in a certain situation, I'm on it. If not, then I won't be.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander won't use injuries as excuse for loss to Pacers",

    "fullText": "Louisville women’s basketball hosting Boston College on Saturday had all the makings of a trap game.\n\nThe seventh-ranked Cardinals were coming off two difficult wins, at Notre Dame and N.C. State, the weekend before. Then, their game against the Eagles, who were on a 13-game losing streak, had to be played a day early due to Winter Storm Fern. Louisville (19-3, 9-0 ACC) didn’t have the cleanest start to the game, turning the ball over six times in the first quarter. But the squad proved its ability to push through mistakes and avoid the trap, recording a 85-56 win over Boston College (4-18,0-9) at the KFC Yum! Center.\n\nUofL downing N.C. State and Notre Dame on the road showed how high its celling could be. Avoiding a letup in less competitive games will be critical for the Cardinals as they remain in the hunt for a regular-season ACC championship. Four of the Cardinals' final nine ACC opponents have losing records in conference play.\n\nMackenly Randolph took her turn leading the Cardinals with a career high-tying 13 points as the team recorded its 12th straight victory. It was the sixth straight game where UofL had a different leading scorer. The offense was needed to make up for the team’s turnover problem, many of which have been unforced. Louisville had a combined 21 turnovers against the Wolfpack and Irish last weekend but had 16 after the third quarter against Boston College.\n\nThe Eagles only totaled nine points off the miscues as part of a struggling offense that knocked down 29% of its shots from the field.\n\nWhen they weren’t turning it over, the Cardinals were efficient shooters. They made 55% of their field goals with all 12 of their available players entering the scoring column. UofL built a 10-0 lead in the first quarter, and Boston College never got closer than eight points for the rest of the game. The Cardinals’ lead ballooned to 42 points in the first four minutes of the fourth quarter, and the squad sailed to a win.\n\nLouisville has a road trip out west next week, beginning with Stanford at 8 p.m. Thursday and California at 2 p.m. next Sunday.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Boston College vs Louisville women's basketball score, ACC standings",

    "fullText": "Umar Nurmagomedov did not leave UFC 322 entirely satisfied.\n\nThe bantamweight contender had a front-row seat as Islam Makhachev defeated Jack Della Maddalena to claim the welterweight title at Madison Square Garden in November. It should have been a huge moment for his team, but attention quickly shifted elsewhere.\n\nMakhachev’s win was overshadowed by a brawl breaking out in the crowd. The incident involved several members of the Dagestani’s camp and one of Conor McGregor’s long-time training partners.\n\nDillon Danis, known for stirring controversy, found himself at the centre of a fight with Makhachev’s team during UFC 322.\n\nThe incident left Danis with minor injuries and led to his removal from the event. He later had to pull out of a scheduled bout against Anthony Taylor.\n\nHowever, Nurmagomedov still thinks he deserved a worse fate.\n\n“This guy talked too much,” he told Complex.\n\n“He talks about religion. He talks about family. He talks about a lot of things.\n\n“It’s not good. You can’t be that person and not expect people to smash you.”\n\nWhen questioned if he enjoyed watching Danis being defeated, Nurmagomedov responded: “Not enough.\n\n“He has to be broken. Some legs and arms.\n\n“He has to be in his hospital between life and death. He deserves it.”\n\nNurmagomedov is aiming to position himself for another bantamweight title shot when he steps into the Octagon at UFC 324.\n\nThe 30-year-old will face off against former two-time flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo in Las Vegas on Saturday night.\n\nA victory could put him in line for a bout with the new bantamweight champion, Petr Yan.\n\nBut there is also growing interest in a potential rematch between Yan and Merab Dvalishvili, which could take priority.\n\nAnother option for Yan is to take on the winner of Sean O’Malley vs Song Yadong, also set to take place at UFC 324.",

    "description": "Ja Morant has been a popular name in trade talks, but an injury may halt any potential moves.",
    "fullText": "Any team looking to acquire Ja Morant before the NBA trade deadline would have to wait a bit before he sees the floor. The Memphis Grizzlies announced Saturday that Morant is out through the Feb. 5 deadline due to a UCL sprain he suffered against the Atlanta Hawks on Jan. 21.\n\nMorant, the oft-injured guard who has already missed time this season with a calf contusion, will be reevaluated in three weeks. The former No. 2 overall pick has never played more than 67 games in a season, and since 2023-24 he's only played 79 games.\n\nThis latest injury complicates the trade talks that have hounded Morant this season. Morant spoke passive-aggressively about his coaching staff after a poor showing against the Los Angeles Lakers on Halloween, resulting in a one-game suspension. By January the Grizzlies reportedly began entertaining offers on Morant, though the Murray State product stated publicly he wanted to remain in Memphis.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks, Sacramento Kings and Miami Heat emerged as potential Morant destinations. None are particularly exciting, so perhaps that explains why Morant changed his tune.\n\nIt's thus far been a frustrating career for Morant. He earned All-Star honors in 2021-22 and 2022-23 while leading the Grizzlies to the No. 2 seed in each of those seasons. Morant is also wildly popular in Memphis and beyond, with a Nike signature shoe to boot. But between the injuries, off-court drama and failure to evolve his offensive game, the cons are seemingly outweighing the pros.\n\nMorant is far too talented to give up on, though, and his latest injury suggests he'll try to bounce back in the city he was drafted to.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Ja Morant injury: Grizzlies star out through NBA trade deadline",

    "fullText": "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has explained why his side opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres instead of Manchester United star Benjamin Sesko.\n\nUnited headed into the summer transfer window with a clear objective of bolstering their attacking department after a goal-shy 2024/25 campaign. The club forked out north of £200m on the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko.\n\nThe Red Devils had kept tabs on Sesko for several years before finally landing him. He has displayed flashes of his considerable potential, particularly through his intelligent movement, aerial prowess, and hold-up play. However, as the player himself has acknowledged, there remains significant room for development before he can be considered a complete striker.\n\nSesko has made 17 Premier League appearances so far, contributing four goals and one assist.\n\nThe Slovenian’s future at Old Trafford looks bright but he could have easily been playing for Arsenal. Like United, the Gunners had earmarked Sesko as a primary target.\n\nArsenal held talks with both RB Leipzig and Sesko’s representatives but the North London outfit eventually opted to shift their attention elsewhere instead, completing a £64m deal for Gyokeres. Interestingly, Gyokeres was also strongly linked with United, in part due to the prospect of reuniting with his former coach, Ruben Amorim.\n\nGyokeres’ record-breaking form in Portugal has yet to translate into fireworks in the Premier League.\n\nAhead of United’s meeting with Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday, Arteta revealed why they settled on Gyokeres ahead of Sesko.\n\nAsked why Gyokeres instead of Sesko, the 43-year-old answered [as quoted by the Metro], “Well, at the end, we have to make a decision, and we believed that Victor was the best one in the scenario that we were in.”\n\n“The qualities that we didn’t have in that number nine as well, because we have the situation with Gabby and Kai out for many, many months, and we are very happy to have him.”\n\nHe added about Gyokeres’ attributes, “Well, first of all, goals. Someone that can guarantee you goals.”\n\n“We know that word doesn’t exist, but then someone very direct, very powerful, a proper nine who can stretch the pitch, who has the goal between the eyes, and somebody that can stretch the pitch for us a bit more, especially when we have to play against certain opposition.”\n\nWhen pressed further on Gyokeres’s underwhelming start in England, Arteta was predictably guarded on the subject, urging patience and more time for the Swedish striker to adapt.\n\nArsenal vs. United kicks off at 4.30pm.\n\nFeatured image Gareth Copley via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Seahawks get important $33 million Kenneth Walker contract projection originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are in the NFC Championship and are going up against the Los Angeles Rams for a chance to go to the Super Bowl.\n\nFor the Seahawks, there's nothing more important than this game. But that doesn't mean preparing for the future should be completely ignored. This offseason, the Seahawks will have a big decision to make with Kenneth Walker.\n\nAccording to Spotrac.com, Walker received a $33 million contract projection, which is significant news for the Seahawks. Thanks to Zach Charbonnet's season-ending ACL tear, Walker's return to Seattle is a much more relevant issue than before.\n\nSpotrac's Market Value has Walker projected to land a $33,591,380 contract this offseason over four years.\n\nWhile he's not the highest projected deal for a running back, behind players like Chase Brown, D'Andre Swift, Breece Hall, and Devon Achane, this projected contract is a very noteworthy one for the Seahawks.\n\nCharbonnet might not be able to play right away in 2026, and if he's missing time, then the Seahawks wouldn't have a running back ready to go on the roster.\n\nWalker is a free agent, and the rest of the running back room are backups or practice squad players. Adding a running back is a priority for the Seahawks this offseason, and bringing Walker back makes too much sense.\n\nWhile this $33 million deal wouldn't be cheap, with the projected contract lasting four years and around $8.4 million per year, it's a very reasonable deal for the Seahawks.\n\nMore: Kenneth Walker's contract situation looms large after dominant showing vs. 49ers\n\nThis season, Walker had 1,027 rushing yards with five touchdowns on 221 attempts. It's not his best season, but in a split backfield with Charbonnet, it's an impressive year for the 25-year-old running back.\n\nHis playoff performance against the San Francisco 49ers, 116 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 19 attempts, with 29 receiving yards on three catches, should bolster his market this offseason.\n\nThe value that Walker provides to the Seahawks is worth the $33 million projected deal from Spotrac.com. He's a great running back and is a very important offseason decision for the Seahawks following Charbonnet's injury.\n\nMike Macdonald keeps Seahawks focused on a bigger prize\n\nZach Charbonnet injury updates: Latest news on Seahawks RB after leaving game vs. 49ers with knee issue\n\nRashid Shaheed kickoff-return TD: How Seahawks put 49ers into immediate hole in divisional-round matchup\n\n49ers vs. Seahawks final score, results: Kenneth Walker, dominant defense help Seattle cruise past San Francisco\n\nSeahawks defense dominates 49ers: How swarming Seattle unit is peaking at right time",

    "fullText": "Ferrari failed to win a Formula 1 race during the 2025 season. It’s already the third time this decade that this has happened.\n\nOne of the founding members of the championship in 1950, Ferrari have had 16 winless seasons. Five of those have come since 2014.\n\nIndeed, between 1994 and 2013 – the period that included Michael Schumacher’s record run of four straight championships – Ferrari won at least one race every single year.\n\nOne has to go back to the 2024 Mexico City GP, when Carlos Sainz won his final race for the Scuderia, for the last time they stood on the top step of the podium. At the time of writing, the drought has reached 28 races.\n\nDespite their recent difficulties, Ferrari are the most successful team in F1 history. They are just two wins shy of 250, while nearest challengers McLaren have only just cleared 200.\n\nThe Ferrari F1 team are based in a small city called Maranello in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy. While there are fewer than 18,000 inhabitants, the presence of the Prancing Horse makes it a famous destination.\n\nAs reported by The Times, local Ferrari fans mark every race win by ringing the bells of the San Biagio church. Meanwhile, the team raise a flag at the factory.\n\nAt the start of every season, the flags are taken down, a move that highlights Ferrari’s winning mentality. The flagpoles were left vacant last year, but the Tifosi are hoping the major regulation changes present an opportunity.\n\nMany of the residents of Maranello are Ferrari employees. It’s estimated that the team have around 1,050 staff (via Kym Illman), although they are very rarely in the same place.\n\nMercedes top the list with 1,250, while Williams sit in a surprising second place alongside Red Bull (1,200).\n\nWilliams are one of F1’s most iconic outfits but they haven’t won a world championship in the 21st century. When the family sold the eponymous team, they were fighting for survival and struggling near the back of the grid.\n\nFerrari beat out McLaren, Aston Martin and Alpine (1,000) for fourth place. Sauber (previously 750 employees) will likely expand following Audi’s takeover.\n\nRed Bull sister team Racing Bulls have around 700 staff, while Haas are comfortably F1’s smallest team (350). Cadillac are joining the grid this year, so it remains to be seen where they slot in.",

Through it, TNA stars such as Frankie Kazarian have been able to appear on WWE programming, while \"WWE NXT\" talents have returned the favor with a number of outings in TNA. On a recent edition of \"Two Man Power Trip,\" Kazarian weighed in on the ongoing partnership.\n\n\"It's been beneficial, that goes without saying, for us, and I think it's been beneficial for NXT,\" he said. \"A lot of those guys that come up in that system, they learn what WWE wants to teach them, which is their way of doing television and matches and all that. Coming to TNA, they get kind of a different taste. It's a bit looser, a lot more freedom when it comes to promos and stuff. There's a little bit less micromanagement, so it's really cool for them to see that side of it.\n\n\"For me, all the stuff I've been able to do at NXT last year, I had a blast,\" he continued. \"They really treated me great. They rolled out the red carpet for me. It was cool just to be part of that crossover.\"\n\nIn Kazarian's case, he has wrestled for \"NXT\" on two occasions, the latest of which saw him and three other TNA men — Moose, Mike Santana, and Leon Slater — defeated four of \"NXT's\" top talents in a Survivor Series-style match in October. Months before that, Kazarian made his \"NXT\" debut in a battle royal to determine the number one contender to the NXT Championship.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Two Man Power Trip\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "title": "50 Most Notable Yankees Free Agents: Jorge Posada (2007)",
    "description": "The Yankees’ slugging catcher hit free agency after a superb 2007, and they had to outbid the Mets to keep him around.",
    "fullText": "When a standout player who has been with your organization his entire career wants to stay with you, you listen. That’s what Yankees general manager Brian Cashman did when Jorge Posada became a free agent after the 2007 campaign.\n\nA five-time All-Star and switch-hitting Silver Slugger, Posada would’ve been a boon for any team on the market. He still stands as one of the best-hitting catchers of the past 50 years, and his bat was elite in 2007. The Yankees had been able to extend him during the 2001-02 offseason for five years and $51 million with club option, but despite expressing interest in staying with the team he had been with his whole career, there was also major interest from the crosstown New York Mets — making the chase for the decorated, switch-hitting backstop all the more interesting.\n\nThe Yankees ended up making the deal, paying Posada the most average annual salary for a catcher at the time—$13.1 million—and thus stopped a rival team from compelling him to remain in the City, in a different borough. Although the final result being a positive one for the Yankees, it certainly wasn’t without its fireworks.\n\nJorge Posada\nSigning Date: November 13, 2007\nContract: Four years, $52.4 million\n\nPosada was already an established star by this the fall of 2007, and it had been a remarkable ascent from near-complete anonymity during the early part of the 1990s. We chronicled his history in greater detail during our Top 100 Yankees series, but we’ll present a shorter version. The Santurce, Puerto Rico native starred in high school and was able to cut his teeth some more at Calhoun Community College in Decatur, AL. He landed on the Yankees’ radar, and after a couple draft attempts, they signed him out of the 24th round in the 1990 edition — two rounds behind the Yanks’ selection of a young high school lefty from Texas named Andy Pettitte.\n\nOriginally a second baseman, Posada was convinced to give catching a try in 1991, when he made 11 appearances behind the plate for short-season Oneonta. By the next year, he was a full-time backstop, and over the next couple seasons, he shot up through the minor leagues, playing 92 games with the Triple-A Columbus Clippers in 1994 and officially debuting with the Yankees in September of ’95. Blocked at the big-league level across ’95 and ’96 by Mike Stanley, Jim Leyritz, and Joe Girardi, Posada played just nine games in The Show during that span, and only traveled with the team as they won it all in October 1996. But even though he would never be confused for a defensive stalwart at catcher, his time would soon come.\n\nPrior to the start of ’97, the Yankees traded Leyritz to the Angels despite his World Series heroics. They wanted to open the door for Posada to get big-league reps as Girardi’s backup and were confident that the up-and-comer could earn his keep. Following a 101 OPS+ in 60 games of action in ’97 though, the Yankees did float Posada as a possible trade option with the Montreal Expos for Cy Young Award winner Pedro Martinez. That obviously did not work out, as Pedro was traded to the rival Boston Red Sox, and the next handful of years would live in infamy between those two teams (and the two players in particular).\n\nPosada finally started over 100 games in the record-breaking ’98 season for the Yankees, slashing .268/.350/.475 with 17 homers for an OPS+ of 115, and his numbers only continued to climb from there. He was eventually trusted with the everyday job as Girardi aged out of the role and departed in December of ’99. The 2000 campaign was the first where Posada really shined, making his first All-Star team and hitting .287/.417/.527 with 28 homers and a 139 OPS+, earning his first Silver Slugger as well.\n\nIt was an important time for Posada to make his mark, as other members of the Yankees’ core like Paul O’Neill and Tino Martinez were nearing the ends of their days in pinstripes. And thanks in part to Posada’s tenacious at-bat against a dominant Al Leiter with two outs in the ninth inning of 2000 World Series Game 5, the Yankees rallied to secure the three-peat, Posada scoring the go-ahead run on Luis Sojo’s single.\n\nAlthough it would be a few years before the Yankees again won it all, Posada was an essential part of the contending operation alongside pal Derek Jeter (the best man in his wedding). Posada earned four consecutive All-Star nods and Silver Sluggers from 2000-03, and he really shined in the last of those years. He became the first Yankees catcher to hit 30 homers in a season since no less than Yogi Berra, and thanks in part to a 144 OPS+ and 5.9 rWAR in 142 games, he finished third for AL MVP, trailing only Alex Rodriguez and Carlos Delgado. And while his 2004-06 seasons weren’t as decorated, he still played a vital role, remaining a pillar of health with 422 games started out of the possible 486, notching a 121 OPS+.\n\nEntering 2007, Posada had one year left on his deal before he would hit free agency, and in spring training, the Yankees were uninterested in opening up talks on a second extension. He timed his best campaign since ’03 quite well, and his bat would’ve received even more attention had A-Rod not turned in an MVP season for the ages. Posada finished sixth in the voting with career-highs in all the rate stats, batting .338/.426/.543 with a 153 OPS+ and 5.4 rWAR to claim his fifth All-Star selection and Silver Slugger. That made him a valuable commodity for teams, despite approaching his late thirties at the most physically demanding position in the sport.\n\nThe Yankees fell to Cleveland in the ALDS that October, and a decision was on the horizon for Posada. He really wanted a four-year deal in wake of that superb season. The Yankees weren’t particularly enthused about handing that long a commitment to a catcher who had just turned 37 that August; they were hoping to get Posada on a three-year contract for around $40 million.\n\nSo Posada was willing to hear out some of his other options, especially since A-Rod had opted out and longtime manager Torre was on his way to the Dodgers. Most notably, the folks across town were very interested. The 2007 season had ended in disaster for the Mets, and catcher Paul Lo Duca took a serious dip after leading the NL East champs in 2006. He was a free agent as well, but GM Omar Minaya had his eyes on Posada, as did his former third-base coach, Mets manager Willie Randolph.\n\nAs such, it was easy for Posada to not-so-subtly get the Yankees’ full attention by meeting with the Mets the day before other clubs could officially submut offers, per the New York Times:\n\nPosada and his agents, Sam and Seth Levinson, had lunch Monday with Minaya and [Mets] vice president Tony Bernazard. The Yankees initially offered the 36-year-old Posada a three-year contract but upped their proposal to four years on Monday evening.\n\nWhile Posada briefly played hard to get for the Yankees, his intentions were clear from the start. He felt it would be easier to stay with the team that he had been with since his mid-twenties, and that’s exactly what happened. The Yankees acquiesced to his request and ultimately signed him to a four-year, $52.4 million deal.\n\nIn those final four seasons, Posada played in 397 games and slashed .258/.349/.454 for an above-average OPS+ of 110. A shoulder injury curtailed both his and the Yankees’ hopes for 2008 success under his old teammate-turned-skipper Girardi, but in 2009, it all came together. Posada hit 22 homers in 438 PA, good for an .885 OPS and 125 OPS+, and he had a productive October as well. Jeter might’ve been the captain, but Posada unofficially led the clubhouse and was willing to be the guy who held teammates accountable when necessary.\n\nThe Bombers won it all, and Posada had his fifth ring. It would be the last one.\n\nPosada’s bat remained strong in 2010 but his oft-uneven defense had made him a liability behind the plate, and he was a concussion risk as well. The Yankees found a bargain in the more well-balanced Russell Martin that offseason, so they signed him and planned to have Posada DH in 2011. The 40-year-old was unhappy in the role and dipped to a below-average showing at the plate, too. Although it was an awkward swan song for Posada, the hard feelings faded in time (and he was actually one of the few consistent bats during their five-game ALDS loss to Detroit). He retired in January 2012 and the Yankees retired his No. 20 in August 2015, honoring him with a plaque in Monument Park.\n\nSo yes, the Yankees had reason to be uneasy about that fourth year. But the overall contract still led to a 2009 World Series crown and the Yankees were able to pivot to a new catcher anyway during that last season. Losing Posada to the Mets would’ve been a true shame; thankfully, they didn’t let it happen.\n\nSee more of the “50 Most Notable Yankees Free Agent Signings in 50 Years” series here.",

    "fullText": "Inter Milan’s hopes of bringing Ivan Perisic back to San Siro may receive a timely boost as developments unfold in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Nerazzurri remain keen on a return for the Croatian winger, even though PSV Eindhoven have so far resisted letting him leave during the January window.\n\nThat stance, however, could soon soften, with reports via FCInter1908.\n\nAccording to Sky Sport, PSV are pushing hard to sign Alphadjo Cisse, a highly rated 2006-born talent owned by Verona and currently impressing on loan at Catanzaro in Serie B.\n\nZAGREB, CROATIA – SEPTEMBER 08: Ivan Perisic of Croatia acknowledges the fans after the team’s victory in the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Croatia and Montenegro at Stadion Maksimir on September 08, 2025 in Zagreb, Croatia. (Photo by Jurij Kodrun/Getty Images)\n\nThe Dutch club are reportedly very close to an agreement, a move that could alter the balance of their squad planning.\n\nCisse’s profile fits what PSV may soon require.\n\nThe young attacker can operate across the frontline and in multiple roles from midfield upwards, including as a wide forward.\n\nHis versatility makes him a credible internal solution should PSV decide to reshape their attacking options before the window closes.\n\nFor Inter, that situation is worth monitoring closely. The Nerazzurri have made it clear they would welcome Perisic back, valuing his experience, tactical flexibility and familiarity with the environment in Milan.\n\nUntil now, PSV’s refusal to part with the player has represented the main obstacle.\n\nIf Cisse does arrive in Eindhoven, the picture could change quickly. PSV would then have greater cover on the flanks, potentially opening the door to negotiations over Perisic.\n\nWhile no green light has arrived yet, Inter remain attentive.\n\nAs the final days of the winter market approach, movements elsewhere could prove decisive. Inter are waiting, and PSV’s next step may finally unlock the situation.",

    "description": "Pimblett will compete for an interim title in the main event of UFC 324",
    "fullText": "Paddy Pimblett and Ilia Topuria have had a beef since 2022, when the now UFC lightweight champion took offense at online comments regarding the Georgia-Russia war. They got physical prior to that year’s UFC London show, and it has escalated since.\n\nPimblett has the chance to win the interim title at UFC 324, when he faces off with Justin Gaethje on Jan. 24 in Las Vegas, and it could lead to a unification bout with Topuria later in 2026.\n\nHowever, fellow lightweight contender Renato Moicano doesn’t give Pimblett much of a chance at beating the Georgian-Spanish star.\n\n“It’s impossible. Technique-wise, it’s very hard,” Moicano told MMA Fighting. “Watch Topuria, man. At the same time Paddy Pimblett can take a hit in the chin, and Paddy Pimblett has jiu-jitsu, has boxing, he’s a bad fighter. I don’t know if you can call him bad, but he’s a fighter that — he’s not very technical, he’s not someone you like watching fight, but he’s beating old men. He beat Bobby Green. I’d like to see him beat [Mauricio] Ruffy, Topuria, Charles [Oliveira]. Time will tell.”\n\nTopuria has two \n\nMoicano said that Pimblett dethroning Topuria could be compared to an all-time upset in the sport: doable, but unlikely.\n\n“I saw Michael Bisping beating Luke Rockhold,” Moicano said. “I saw Matt Serra beat GSP. We saw Chris Weidman beat Anderson Silva. Obviously, maybe the Matt Serra one would look more similar because he’s a short guy, has jiu-jitsu and all that, but upsets can happen in a fight. It can happen, man. And I hope it does.”\n\nMoicano was a huge underdog when he took a shot at then-champion Islam Makhachev on a day’s notice back in January, and explained why he would love a similar upset with a Pimblett championship victory.\n\n“I would be very happy if that happened because I like unexpected things, brother,” Moicano said. “Imagine the best fighter in the world losing to Paddy Pimblett? Absolute cinema. I like when the unexpected happen. It would be really cool to see someone like Paddy Pimblett become world champion.”",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace vs Brighton rivalry explained: History between Eagles and Seagulls in 'M23 derby' and distance between both clubs originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe animosity between Crystal Palace and Brighton and Hove Albion is as mystifying to many fans of other clubs as it is intense for the supporters involved in what has become known as the 'M23 derby'.\n\nPalace and Brighton have faced each other more than 100 times since both clubs were formed at the start of the 20th century, but tensions have escalated relatively recently to produce one of the fiercest rivalries in English football.\n\nThe Eagles and Seagulls also have one of the closest head-to-head record of any teams involved in a derby with one another, and matches between them have produced a number of epic games over the decades.\n\nYet fans will notice that the two clubs are not located in close proximity to one another, making this rivalry one of the few heated Premier League clashes that is not based primarily on geographical location.\n\nHere's a look at why the rivalry exists, where it gets its name from, and some of those memorable matches between the clubs.\n\nMORE: Next Premier League manager to leave: Updated odds\n\nWhile most teams involved in derbies lie in close proximity to each other, Crystal Palace and Brighton's separation of 43 miles means they are not even in the same county.\n\nIt would not be hyperbolic, however, to describe their relationship as a footballing hatred – and although the sides had regularly played each other in previous years, the venom started during the 1970s.\n\nOn the opening day of the 1974/75 season, significant outbreaks of trouble were noted among a crowd of more than 26,000 as a Brighton team managed by Peter Taylor - assistant to Brian Clough the previous season - won 1-0 against a visiting Palace side who had suffered successive relegations.\n\nMore than 33,000 people watched Brighton beat Palace 2-0 in February 1976, when home supporters subverted the visitors' 'Eagles' nickname with chants of 'Seagulls' – an emblem the club fully adopted two seasons later.\n\nLWT The Big Match\nOctober 1976\nTwo Clubs That Don’t Get On!\nBrighton 1-1 Crystal Palace\nCommentator Brian Moore#BHAFC#CPFCpic.twitter.com/I4IE19UDdp\n\n— TV Football 1968-92 (@1968Tv) November 14, 2022\n\nBoth Brighton and Palace were promoted from what was then known as Division Three at the end of the 1976/77 campaign, but it was a cup tie that stoked the first flames of what has become a fiery mutual contempt.\n\nInseparable over two first-round FA Cup ties in four days, the clubs faced each other for a third time - replays took place until there was a winner in those days - at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge after several rearrangement efforts had fallen foul of bad weather.\n\nIt proved the latest explosive collision between two tough characters: future England boss Terry Venables, as Palace manager, and his former Tottenham teammate, Alan Mullery, guiding Brighton's fortunes.\n\nCrystal Palace manager Terry Venables #cpfc#Palace#Managerspic.twitter.com/TdOybzc4dK\n\n— Football Memories (@footballmemorys) November 12, 2016\n\nThe pair had roomed together at Tottenham but they were rivals for a captaincy that was given to Mullery over Venables by Spurs manager Bill Nicholson.\n\nPalace won the third and final tie between their clubs that season 1-0 but there was controversy when Albion captain Brian Horton's apparent equaliser from a penalty was disallowed by referee Ron Challis, affording opposition goalkeeper Paul Hammond a chance he took to save the retaken spot kick.\n\nBrighton were also aggrieved that a goal by revered striker Peter Ward had been disallowed after Palace took the lead.\n\nMullery reacted by confronting the referee at full-time, flicking a 'V' sign at the celebrating Palace fans – an image that remains iconic to their Brighton counterparts – and reputedly throwing his spare change towards the opposition players and staff, adding: “Palace ain’t worth that.\"\n\nDo you remember the first time?\n\nThe first I can remember is the FA Cup 2nd replay in Dec ‘76. Palace won 1-0 but that’s only half the story.\n\nA fan launched his cuppa over Mullery, he emptied his pocket, 'That's all you're worth, Crystal Palace!’\n\nLet the fun begin! pic.twitter.com/HSOQA5lZlq\n\n— carl (@calciocarl) February 21, 2021\n\n“The lads were all happy that they’d won,\" recalled Martin Hinshelwood, a Palace player at the time who would go on to become a highly influential youth coach at Brighton and briefly manage the Seagulls in 2002.\n\n\"How we’d won, I don’t know,\" he added to The Athletic. \"Brighton deserved to win. There was a bit of banter, then the door opened.\n\n\"Alan came in and said, ‘This is what I think of you lot’ and threw some coins on the floor. We had one or two heated players in the side and it just went off a little bit.\n\nIn 1976-77, Crystal Palace & Brighton played each other 5 times (including 3 FA Cup games!) & bad blood between managers Terry Venables and Alan Mullery spawned a club rivalry.\nHere are the programmes from the initial First Round and replay games.#cpfc#bhafc#facuppic.twitter.com/D44dxen8Db\n\n— Aaron Porter (@AaronPorter) May 27, 2020\n\n\"Terry was in the dressing room. Venners was like, ‘So what? We won. Unlucky’. The rivalry started from that. Venners always seemed to outdo Alan.”\n\nFormer England international Mullery, who would have an unsuccessful and unpopular tenure as Palace manager between 1982 and 1984 and a second brief spell at Brighton from 1986, could not have imagined the endless soap opera that he had played a pivotal part in accelerating.\n\nHuge crowds and fighting between groups of fans continued to be features of the games off the pitch, while the teams were frequently involved in promotion tussles in the lower divisions and matches containing drama the like of which scriptwriters might deem too fanciful.\n\nFebruary: Christian Benteke scores a 95th minute winner against Brighton for Crystal Palace\n\nSeptember: Neal Maupay scores a 95th minute equaliser against Crystal Palace for Brighton\n\nThe rivalry always delivers. pic.twitter.com/LGAK70zJFH\n\n— bet365 (@bet365) September 27, 2021\n\nMullery's Brighton won 3-1 at Newcastle on the final day of the 1978/79 season to earn promotion to the top flight for the first time, but some of the shine was taken off their triumph when Venables' Palace beat them to the title with victory at their Selhurst Park home against Burnley six days later.\n\nSelhurst Park was also the setting for undoubtedly the most extraordinary of the derbies. In 1989, fans had their nerves shattered when five penalties were awarded within 27 minutes of a 2-1 win for Palace.\n\nOnly three of those were scored, with Palace goalscoring greats Ian Wright – once rejected by Brighton for being too small – and Mark Bright each missing one.\n\nIan Wright on one of his best ever goals for Palace in a classic win over Brighton. 💥🔴🔵 @IanWright0#cpfc#cpfcfamilypic.twitter.com/GLmBmrWoKk\n\n— Screaming Alice (@screamingalice1) December 15, 2019\n\nAlthough Palace were known as 'The Team of the 80s', that remarkable game was one of only three times in 14 attempts when they beat Brighton during the decade, including five successive defeats as part of a wretched run of eight losses and two draws in 10 derbies between 1979 and 1986.\n\nEven though the teams did not meet in the league between 1990 and 2001, Palace were able to enjoy being by far the more successful club during the period, when their achievements included their highest ever finish in the top flight, in 1991, and two promotions from the second tier.\n\nAlbion also looked on enviously at Palace's stability off the pitch compared to a period of turmoil for the Sussex side that saw them almost go out of business, leaving their Goldstone Ground home where they had spent 96 years and played many of their matches with Palace across the century.\n\nIf it was seen as a mark of Brighton's recovery when they finally got to play Palace again, the wait was worth it only for the home fans at Selhurst Park, whose claims of supremacy across the intervening years were further enhanced by the 5-0 thrashing they handed out on the day, including a hat-trick for future England striker Andy Johnson.\n\nBrighton beat Palace for the first time in almost 17 years with a surprise 1-0 win at Selhurst Park in 2005, but that would precede a run of one win in eight games for them in the fixture.\n\nPalace had the pleasure of becoming the first team to beat Brighton at their new Amex Stadium home in 2011, then repeated the trick with a 2-0 win to prevail by the same score on aggregate in the 2013 Championship playoff semifinals, when Wilfried Zaha scored both goals within 20 second-half minutes.\n\nIn 2020, Palace won at Brighton for the first time in the Premier League when Jordan Ayew scored the only goal of the final game many supporters would see before crowds were outlawed during the Covid pandemic.\n\nAll of the four subsequent derbies were decided by a goal after the 87th minute, with three of those coming in the 90th minute.\n\nBrighton won the last match between the sides 1-0 in March 2023 and the Seagulls well and truly have bragging rights given their exploits in Europe right now while Palace flounder in the bottom half of the table.\n\nMedia coverage occasionally uses the term 'M23 derby' as a nod to the distance between the rivals and the motorway between Brighton and London.\n\nThe sporadic use of 'A23 derby' is more accurate, as that is the road directly connecting the areas.\n\n\"I'm amazed – I can't really believe it's gone on so long,\" Mullery told BT Sport in 2021, recalling how he had been booed by Palace fans during a ceremony at another of his former sides, Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nMullery said he had been sent off by the referee after that infamous game, then reacted by telling Palace they were worth less than 30p after having hot coffee poured on his head by an agitator in the stands.\n\n\"It's been carried on from person to person to person,\" he reflected. \"It was tough – but I'm quite tough at taking whatever someone throws at me.\"\n\nMORE: Premier League all-time top scorers: Where does Harry Kane rank in history? Can he break the record?\n\nJim Cannon, who became a Palace legend while playing for them between 1973 and 1988 and marked Ward in that incendiary cup clash, spoke about the rivalry at a club event in 2017.\n\n\"The fans, with it being a local derby, just hated one another,\" he said. \"The fans began to really hate one another when we had this long, drawn out cup tie.\n\n\"We played in conditions they wouldn't play in today at Stamford Bridge. Mullery threw this five-pound or ten-pound note down and loudly said, 'this is all you lot are worth.' From that day on, the fans just hate Brighton.\"",

    "fullText": "I’ve often told my non-golfing friends that one of life’s greatest teases is spending an hour or two along 17-Mile Drive — that breathtaking stretch of road winding through the Monterey Peninsula. It brushes past legendary courses like Pebble Beach Golf Links, Cypress Point, Spyglass Hill, The Links at Spanish Bay, Monterey Peninsula Country Club, and Poppy Ridge.\n\nFor around 12 bucks, even those indifferent to the game can enjoy a scenic sampler of the region, leaving with a phone full of Instagram-worthy shots of some of the most stunning landscapes imaginable.\n\nBut for those of us who live to walk mist-covered fairways and strategize our way through the world’s finest golf holes, the experience is bittersweet. We leave a piece of ourselves behind, wondering if we’ll ever find the time — or the access — to check off any boxes on this nearly mythical bucket list. The slow cruise is both exhilarating and agonizing. It’s like being offered a taste of hors d'oeuvres at a Michelin-starred restaurant, only to be shown the door just as the main course begins to emerge from the kitchen.\n\nThat was exactly how I felt two decades ago, when my daily concerns revolved around the Buffalo Bills and the Sabres. I was working five nights a week as executive sports editor and lead columnist for a daily newspaper, and two more as a weekend sports anchor on the local ABC affiliate. It was a hectic, uneasy existence, shaped by a city and its struggling franchises — post-Jim Kelly, pre-Josh Allen — when the Bills were barely a blip on the national sports radar.\n\nYet every summer, my personal 17-Mile Drive would resurface. The Porter Cup rolled through town, bringing the world’s top amateur golfers to Niagara Falls Country Club. I’d mingle with rising stars like Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson, Jason Kokrak, Colt Knost, Gary Woodland, and more. The event took over Lewiston, N.Y., the small village where I resided. A friend who hosted players built an indoor hitting bay just for Adam Scott. One rain delay gave me unexpected hours with Billy Horschel, who walked me through the finer points of his game. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson had come through just before my time, and Max Homa and Justin Thomas followed after I’d moved on.\n\nIt was a delicious dive into a world I didn’t experience for most of the year, and when the entire circus left town after a post-tournament party in the backyard of a friend, I was always left wondering what it would be like to follow these young stars each week.\n\nBut while the golfers were the main attraction for fans, my eyes each summer turned to Ron Balicki.\n\nBorn to a family in public housing in Connecticut, Balicki spent time in Arkansas, but eventually found his way to Florida at a time when the golf scene was rapidly ramping up, and after a dozen years at the daily newspaper near Destin, he was named Golfweek’s first managing editor in 1983. While others might have used that as a means to focus solely on the pros, Balicki eventually worked his way back into the game’s grassroots, becoming a legendary college and amateur reporter.\n\nWhen Balicki died in 2014, Golfweek’s then managing editor Jeff Babineau (who has also since passed) penned these incredible paragraphs:\n\nBalicki was an ambassador, serving as Golfweek’s introductory calling card and first handshake to promising amateurs and college players. He not only got to know players, but grew close with their families, too, forging lifelong friendships. Phil Mickelson called him from Doral a few weeks ago to thank Ron for his integrity. When amateur Rickie Fowler decided that he was turning pro in 2009, he stopped mid-practice round and made the one call he knew he needed to make, phoning Balicki.\n\nHis span covering the college game dated to the powerhouse teams of Coach Dave Williams at the University of Houston in the 1980s, and he wrote a great deal about the Stanford teams of the mid-90s that included a rising star named Tiger Woods. Every young American champion of the last three decades who has risen through the amateur ranks – from Scott Verplank to Davis Love III to Mickelson to Justin Leonard to Woods to Ryan Moore to Fowler – was anointed somewhere along his early path with a story carrying a Ron Balicki byline. For years, before the Internet rolled around, he’d even keep his own stats and scribble out Golfweek’s weekly college and amateur rankings by hand on tall, yellow legal pads.\n\nRon Balicki’s story is foundational to Golfweek’s existence — not just for what he contributed to the game, but for how he did it. He was revered not for bravado, but for depth of knowledge. His legacy is built on longevity, expertise, and humility — not bombast.\n\nAs Golfweek celebrates its 50th anniversary, we honor the journey from Charley Stine’s garage in Winter Haven, Florida, to becoming a global voice in golf. Originally printed on paper, Golfweek was the lunchpail-toting publication that mirrored Balicki’s ground-up approach — building trust with players and fans alike. As Curtis Strange recently told me, “We read all the golf publications, but we couldn’t wait to get to Golfweek — to see the stats from every amateur event and compare ourselves with other players. We had to have it.”\n\nFive decades later, the spirit of Balicki, Babineau, Stine, and others who shaped this publication lives on. It’s reflected in Cameron Jourdan’s extensive amateur golf coverage, Jason Lusk’s deep dives into courses, David Dusek’s exhaustive equipment testing, and Eamon Lynch’s incisive columns. And while Beth Ann Nichols and Adam Schupak lead our extensive pro tour coverage, Golfweek remains committed to celebrating the entire game — not just when the purses are biggest.\n\nThese relationships endure. I was reminded of that at this year’s Valero Texas Open, when Brian Harman lit up recalling his 2007 Porter Cup win — a record-setting performance that still tops the event's all-time leaderboard. Or when I heard a touching story from the family who housed Horschel during his amateur days near my hometown. Soon after the family patriarch passed away, Horschel won the 2014 FedEx Cup, a moment that changed his career’s trajectory. Yet he found the time to quickly text them a photo of the trophy, adding, “This one’s for your dad.”\n\nGolfweek’s 50th anniversary isn’t just a milestone — it’s a tribute to the relationships, stories, and spirit that have defined the publication for half a century. And it’s a promise that those values will continue to guide us into the next.\n\nTim Schmitt is the managing editor of Golfweek, and has just two of the 17-Mile Drive courses crossed off his list.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Golfweek at 50: Relationships still matter",

    "fullText": "Bristol Bears leapfrogged Exeter Chiefs to move up to third in the Prem table with a hard-fought 8-3 win in appalling conditions at Sandy Park.\n\nWith the rain teeming down, the first half was largely punctuated by handling errors and referee Karl Dickson's whistle, with neither side able to get points on the board until Henry Slade's penalty just before the half-hour mark.\n\nThe game's only try then came through Noah Heward's sliding effort, after Olly Woodburn was unable to gather the ball as half-time approached.\n\nIn what had looked increasingly like a scoreless second half, James Williams' late penalty condemned Rob Baxter's men to their first home defeat of the season.\n\nIn a match that was meant to herald the long-awaited returns of Bears stalwarts Steven Luatua and Gabriel Ibitoye, all the focus was on the conditions, with neither team able to produce the running rugby so desired by both fan bases.\n\nBarely able to see through the rain, both sides adopted a hard yards and box kicking approach in the first half, one that failed to deliver any real attacking momentum for either until the dying moments of the first half.\n\nIt was Slade who stepped up, converting a penalty, minutes after Tom Jordan had squandered a similar opportunity for Bristol at the other end.\n\nIn a game desperately crying out for points, Slade was then forced to dot the ball down under his own posts after Woodburn's mishandling led to the ball squirming out on the liquid surface.\n\nFrom the ensuing scrum, Bristol eventually capitalised.\n\nSlade was lucky not to be penalised when he knocked on as he attempted to intercept a pass meant for Matias Moroni deep in the Chiefs' 22.\n\nBut Louis Rees-Zammit was able to pick up the ball and find space on the outside to feed Heward, who slid in for what turned out to be the only try of the game.\n\nWith the rain easing as the second half began, Exeter drove up into the Bears' 22, but were unable to break through the impervious Bristol defence, eventually being penalised after Gabriel Oghre had stolen the ball back.\n\nSlade then had the chance to put Exeter ahead for the first time, but his penalty from the halfway line drifted agonisingly wide.\n\nThe Chiefs had the majority of the ball but were unable to capitalise and it was the Bears who looked most like scoring when Rees-Zammit counter-attacked, only for his grubber kick forward to drift long, allowing Woodburn to recover.\n\nThe home side then paid for their profligacy.\n\nSlade's up and under was charged down in midfield, forcing the England centre to dive on the loose ball before being penalised for holding on.\n\nWilliams then made no mistake, slotting the ensuing penalty through the posts as Bristol left Sandy Park sodden, but victorious.\n\nThe result leaves Exeter in fifth on 35 points, following Leicester's 34-7 win over Harlequins.\n\nVan Poortvliet shines as Leicester dominate Quins\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nBristol Bears' director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Radio Bristol:\n\n\"The beauty of the weather is that it was black and white, we had to roll our sleeves up and commit to everything.\n\n\"The physicality, the getting up off the ground, making another tackle, the defensive sets we had were brilliant, not just to defend but also not to give away penalties.\n\n\"We're really showing that we can win in lots of ways - there is more to this team than just throwing the ball around.\n\n\"To win eight games out of the last nine is brilliant, absolutely brilliant.\"\n\nExeter Chiefs' director of rugby Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon:\n\n\"We made quite a lot of errors, there's a lot of things for us to look at that we could've done better, but the Bears made a lot of errors as well.\n\n\"In a very tight game, they probably shaded the areas that win and lose games. Their mistakes hurt them less than ours did.\n\n\"We didn't quite finish things off, they defended their line really strongly, we weren't quite good enough today, let's move on.\"\n\nExeter: Woodburn; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Haydon-Wood, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Chapman; Sio, Dweba, Tchumbadze; Jenkins (c), Zambonin, Hooper, Roots, Fisilau.\n\nReplacements: Yeandle, Goodrick-Clarke, Roots, Pearson, Capstick, Cairns, Hammersley, Ridl.\n\nBristol: Rees-Zammit; Heward, Moroni, Janse van Rensburg, Ravouvou; Jordan, Randall; Genge, Oghre, Kloska; Rubiolo, Batley, Luatua, Harding (c), Mata.\n\nReplacements: Thacker, Lahiff, Halliwell, Owen, Grondona, Marmion, Williams, Ibitoye.",

    "fullText": "The Tennessee Volunteers look to get their season back on track as they head to Tuscaloosa for a showdown with the No. 17 Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nTennessee has lost three of its last five, but that slide can’t be pinned on five-star freshman Nate Ament, who I’m backing to have a big game in my Tennessee vs. Alabama predictions.\n\nHere are my best free college basketball picks for this conference clash on Saturday, January 24.\n\nTennessee vs Alabama best bet: Nate Ament Over 15.5 points (-120)\n\nTennessee forward Nate Ament is averaging 15.4 points and 6.3 rebounds per game and has shown improved efficiency of late. The silky-smooth 6-foot-10 freshman is shooting 49.1% from the field over his last six games after connecting at just a 38% clip across his first 12 contests.\n\nAment has scored 17 or more points in three straight games and draws a favorable matchup tonight against an Alabama team that plays at a blazing-fast pace while offering little resistance on defense.\n\nThe Crimson Tide are 329th nationally in points allowed per game (82.6), with that number ballooning to 86.8 against high-major opponents. They also sit outside the top 300 in free throws allowed per game (25.2), while Ament ranks in the top 15th percentile in free-throw rate.\n\nAment’s ability to score in transition and consistently get to the line should help him eclipse his points total tonight.\n\nLet’s also back Ament to have a productive night on the glass, as Alabama’s extremely fast tempo has the Tide ranked 358th in rebounds allowed per game (41.3).\n\nTennessee hasn’t looked great of late, but neither has Alabama, which is 2–7 ATS in its last nine games against Top-100 KenPom opponents at home. The Vols check in at No. 23 at KenPom and are 14th in adjusted defensive efficiency.\n\nTennessee would have a solid chance to cover this spread even if the Tide were at full strength, and that may not be the case. Alabama’s second- and third-leading scorers, Aden Holloway and Amari Allen, have both been downgraded to questionable for tonight.\n\nWith the Tide possibly missing their second and third-highest scorers against a strong Vols defense, I'm leaning towards the Under on a lofty total.\n\nThe Under has cashed in 10 of 12 meetings between these SEC foes during Rick Barnes' tenure.\n\nSpread: Tennessee +6.5 (-110) | Alabama -6.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Tennessee +230 | Alabama -280\n\nOver/Under: Over 167.5 (-110) | Under 167.5 (-110)\n\nThe Vols have gone 4-0 SU and 3-1 ATS in the last four meetings between these conference foes.

    "fullText": "Harry Kane offered an honest assessment of Bayern Munich’s performance following their defeat against Augsburg, pointing to missed chances and a lack of control as decisive factors:\n\n“Our first half was okay,” Kane said. “I think we deserved the lead, and we also had moments where we could have actually decided the game.”\n\nThe England captain highlighted Bayern’s shortcomings in the final third, admitting that the cutting edge was missing at key moments. “Our final touch wasn’t quite clean, the final pass was lacking, and their goalkeeper made some good saves,” he explained. Kane also warned of the dangers of failing to extend a narrow advantage: “At 1-0, the game is always open, no matter who you’re playing against; you can be punished for it.”\n\nKane noted a visible drop in intensity after the break. “In the second half, we lacked a bit of energy; we weren’t as fluid with the ball,” he said, before crediting the opposition for raising their level. “Respect to our opponents: they put on more pressure and made it difficult for us.”\n\nDespite the disappointment, Kane was quick to shift focus to what lies ahead. “It’s been a tough stretch with a lot of games,” he added. “But things move quickly, and now we’re focusing on the Champions League.”",

    "description": "How can the Titans take the biggest step forward this offseason.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans have been down on some hard times, obviously. After spending the last two years in complete poverty, it’s obvious the Titans need some juice. They got off to a pretty decent start by hiring well-known culture guy and defensive genius, Robert Saleh. On a personal note, thanks to this, I’ve found myself falling back in love with Robert Saleh, the coaching prospect, once again.\n\nNow that the Titans have their leaders in the building, it’s time for the rest of the offseason. I personally have my own thoughts on how it should go, which I will share momentarily. So, without further ado, this is my personal opinion on what the Tennessee Titans should do this offseason.\n\nThe first big step the Tennessee Titans will take this season with roster construction is who Saleh will bring in for his staff. The biggest wonder for the coaching staff would have to be, “Who is our next offensive coordinator?” One of the things Saleh prided himself on during his interview was his plan for what he would do for the offensive staff and how he would keep consistency in the coordinator position. The person I want most is Brian Daboll; his offense fits very well with the stuff that Cam wants to do, and he can develop Ward’s fundamentals in the same way he did for Josh Allen, but the question then becomes, “What if he takes the Buffalo job?”\n\nWell, there are a lot of options if Daboll ends up flopping. My personal favorite guy for QB coach, Mick Lombardi, could be solid as an OC. Bobby Slowik could be great as well, with how his Texans tenure has aged, and I have a feeling the youngest Kubiak, who’s with the San Francisco 49ers, will tell Shanahan that he wants to have a chance at jobs around the league. He has a lot of good options for that side, and the chances of him ending up with someone good are very high in my eyes. On the defensive side, the coordinator probably doesn’t matter as much, with Saleh calling plays and all, but there’s still some importance. Saleh needs a great teacher on that side of the ball who can communicate Saleh’s philosophies and how he calls his defense.\n\nSomeone who makes perfect sense for this is 49ers defensive line coach Kris Kocurek. He’s a well-respected coach who is a very good teacher, and if anyone knows Saleh’s defense, it’s him. As I’m writing this, Bones Fassell was retained as special teams coordinator, so it felt right to mention that.\n\nNow, I’m not gonna break down every position coach, but I’ll mention one or two. For QB coach, I’d love to see Mick Lombardi get poached from the 49ers. I would love to see Mike Munchak return to coach the O-line, they retained Tight Ends coach Luke Stocker, and then for the defensive staff, if you can even get one of those guys from Seattle, you need to go for it, just so you can pick his brain. I don’t expect all of these to come true, but I would love to see it.\n\nNow, free agency is a completely different beast when it comes to predictions. While there’s some dot connecting, free agency is more about getting the best players you can get than it is about who you know. So, for this, it’s best to address the Titans’ biggest needs instead of going over dot connections. The three biggest needs for the Titans are Edge, Wide Receiver, and Cornerback.\n\nFor Edge, it has been made apparent that the plan for pick one in the draft (especially after the Saleh hire) is to go get the alpha edge of the future. So, instead of that, we can talk about stopgap rushers and depth guys. For a stopgap guy that can start while Femi develops in the background, Joey Bosa would make sense, a dude that can be decent for one or two years and that can bring veteran leadership from his time with winning organizations, who is also connected with Saleh through his brother, Nick. If you don’t get him, there are still other great options, too.\n\nFor receivers, start out by steering clear of Brandon Aiyuk and George Pickens, who are locker room problems that do not need to be anywhere near a recovering culture. If Alec Pierce ends up a free agent, you try your best to get him and Romeo Doubs, which will make the receiver core a lot better for a young QB. Juan Jennings is also an option at wide receiver with the Saleh connection on top of him being a UT alum. Maybe for a depth receiver, they could get Dyami Brown, not only because he’s solid depth, but also because you may be able to get inside info on the Jags offense and how to beat it.\n\nFor Corner, this seems to be, out of the three, the position that will get hit hardest in free agency. Starting, it seems to me that you already have your slot CB next year in Marcus Harris. I wouldn’t be shocked if the Titans went with a CB2 in the third, so that leaves us looking for a true CB1. The most obvious choice for this role is Jaylen Watson, with his Borgonzi connection combined with the fact that we can offer him a bigger contract than most make him a great fit for this roster and its needs. Some depth pieces could include Amik Robertson, Rock Ya-Sin, and Nick McCloud, not exactly starters, but solid players for depth.\n\nNow, the NFL Draft is where this whole offseason completely comes together. These guys are the future of the Titans and will be the ones that stay, even when guys like Big Jeff or Amani Hooker are gone. I’m not going to go over every single pick in the draft; that would take up a little too much space. So, I’ll go over the first three picks and then give an idea of what I hope for the rest of the draft to be.\n\nStarting with the fourth pick in the draft, it seems to be obvious that the Titans will go edge rusher with pick one. With Reese probably off the board at this point, the choices will probably be David Bailey and Rueben Bain. Personally, I’d lean toward Rueben Bain because of his fit for the Titans’ defense now that Robert Saleh is employed. I would 100% understand going with David Bailey here, though, with his amazing pass-rushing abilities and his very high potential.\n\nIn round two, it’s obvious the Titans need to go receiver here and hope that he can develop into a solid two or even one. Depending on what they do in free agency, there are two dudes the Titans could go with here. Chris Brazzell is a receiver who can just go up and get the ball, and he also has good speed. If you need a pure route runner that can get open, Elijah Sarrat is a guy who can do that and is good at tracking the ball mid-air. Both of these guys bring something to the table, and it just comes down to who the Titans get in free agency.\n\nIn the third round, they need to take a shot at a corner back and hope he becomes or develops into a starter. There’s Keionte Scott, a very physical DB with phenomenal instincts; his length fits Borgonzi’s wants in a DB. Julian Neal is one I personally really like, with his long build and great awareness in zone coverage. Either way, the Titans need to attack DB in the draft at one of their premium positions in the draft.\n\nAfter those three, the draft becomes very unpredictable for the Titans and their wants. Personally, I believe they should hit receiver and DB as hard as they can to try and find a diamond in the rough that can either develop into a starter or a solid depth piece in the next two years. Also, Tight end would be nice, finding a complement for Gunnar Helm, or even getting a kicker of the future with a late pick.\n\nOverall, the Titans’ offseason is full of a lot of important things, just comes down to how well they execute.",

    "title": "Mailbag: Should Las Vegas Raiders use free agency to build around Fernando Mendoza?",
    "description": "Returning Raider Nation’s questions for the week.",
    "fullText": "After winning the College Football National Championship on Monday and declaring for the 2026 NFL draft on Friday, the buzz surrounding Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza and the Las Vegas Raiders picked up a notch this week. Also, the Raiders are still looking for their next head coach and free agency is steadily approaching, leading us into this week’s mailbag!\n\nQ: What do you think of using the majority of the cap space this year to put vets around Mendoza on offense? I like the thought of adding two OL and Alec Pierce (NFL Charlie Becker, lol) around Mendoza, then building the defense through the draft with players in the 2nd/3rd like Akheem Mesidor and maybe D’Angelo Ponds.\n\nA: I think we’re on pretty much the same page here. I’d like the Raiders to get younger this offseason and primarily target free agents who are looking for their second NFL contract, but the offensive line is the one exception to that.\n\nWith a young quarterback, I’d have no problem seeing the Raiders spend big (and probably overpay) for experienced offensive linemen to make sure Mendoza is well-protected. That’s one of the beauties of having a quarterback on a rookie contract: a team has more flexibility for expensive contracts at other spots on the roster since the quarterback isn’t eating up a significant portion of the cap space.\n\nFor example, Cam Ward has an $11.1 million cap hit next season, and that’s a big reason why the Tennessee Titans enter the offseason with more cap space than any other team in the league and by over $11 million, per Over the Cap. The Raiders are currently second with $82.4 million, by the way.\n\nAt wide receiver, that’s a tricky need for me. More on that later. Las Vegas should prioritize the line and add one or two starters in free agency, as you mentioned, but I wouldn’t mind the front office going after Pierce on top of a couple of linemen. That’d give Mendoza a legitimate downfield threat who is coming off a career year and is only 26 years old.\n\nAs for the draft, this year’s class is heavier on the defensive prospects compared to the offensive guys, and I like both the players you named. Mesidor is getting some first-round love after an impressive CFP run, but he is going to be a 25-year-old rookie and has had a lingering foot injury, which could push him into round two. I’ll be interested to see how Ponds performs at the Senior Bowl next week, but I think he has the traits to be a good nickelback in the NFL.\n\nQ: Assuming the Raiders choose to use their #36 pick for the OL, who are your top candidates for that selection?\n\nA: On a similar but different note, if Las Vegas opts to use the draft to address the offensive line, here are a few guys I’d be interested in at No. 36:\n\nG Olaivavega Ioane, Penn State (likely a first-rounder, though)\n\nObviously, that’s heavy on the interior line, but this tackle isn’t very good. There are a couple of third-round options who could fill in at right tackle, though. Clemson’s Blaker Miller and Iowa’s Gennigs Dunker, but Dunker might slide inside in the NFL.\n\nCan’t wait to see Mendoza in the S&B, but who will he throw to not named Bowers? What are some draft and/or FA approaches to building up an NFL-quality receiving corps? Does it make more sense to spend on vets so only one end of the passing game is on the steep learning curve, or are we looking for a Burrow/Chase thing with two dynamic rookies (OK, Burrow wasn’t a rook, but still)? I’d hate to see Mendoza throwing to Thornton if he still can’t win the 50/50s, or Bech if he still has trouble running routes correctly.\n\nA: Onto the wide receiver dilemma. After spending second- and fourth-round picks on wideouts last year, I have a hard time seeing John Spytek using anything more than a Day 3 pick on the position this April. Yes, Jack Bech and Dont’e Thornton Jr. had underwhelming rookie seasons, but they also didn’t get much playing time. That makes it hard to know what the Raiders have in them (thanks, Pete!), and Bech at least showed some promise in his limited opportunities, in my opinion. So, I think signing someone like Pierce is more realistic than using another Top 100 draft pick out wide.\n\nYou mentioned Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, so I’ll throw this scenario that I’ve been dreaming of for the last month. How about pairing Mendoza with Ohio State wide receiver Jeremiah Smith after the 2027 draft?\n\nI’m not expecting much from Las Vegas next season, so I think the organization will have another high pick next year. If that quarterback class ends up being as good as a lot of people seem to be making it out to be right now, then the Raiders should have a clear path to draft Smith, who will be one of the best wide receiver prospects in like a decade. Also, Mendoza has drawn comparisons to Matt Ryan while Smith’s early comp is Julio Jones, and that duo worked out pretty well for the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe route I’d go with to address the wide receiver room is see what Bech and Thornton can do with bigger opportunities next season and take it from there. If they don’t rise to the occasion, then I set my sights on Smith in next year’s draft.\n\nWhat do you think of Omar Cooper as a 3rd round WR target if we go OL/D in the second?\n\nA: I’ll say this, I like taking Omar Cooper in the third round more than Elijah Sarratt in the second. Between the two Indiana receivers, I think Cooper’s the better value pick, and his game translates to the NFL more with his YAC ability. I get the idea of giving Mendoza a target he’s familiar with, but I’d rather see the Raiders add defensive players this spring after loading up on offense during last year’s draft.\n\nWill Fernando Mendoza turn out to be an NFL QB that can make off schedule plays and put the O on his back against an good NFL defenses?\n\nAlso, what is his biggest strength, biggest weakness?\n\nA: Mendoza’s game is centered around being good within the structure of the play call, and he isn’t someone like Caleb Williams, who is going to make the ridiculous backyard football style of plays to bail the offense out consistently. In other words, don’t expect Mendoza to scramble around and throw a 40-yard heave into the endzone on fourth and four from the 14-yard line like we saw Williams do last weekend.\n\nBut I do think Mendoza’s ability to create is underrated. He’s good at making defenders pay when they don’t plaster to their man on scramble drills, and is athletic enough to move the chains with his legs. The latter was on display against a very talented Miami defense on Monday night. So, I don’t think the off-script stuff is going to be his calling card in the NFL, but it’s not as if he can’t do it at all.\n\nIn my opinion, Mendoza’s biggest strength is his poise. Whether it’s facing pressure in the pocket or the pressure of a big moment in the game, he doesn’t back down and that was apparent all season. His biggest weakness is that he’s not the physical freak that people have become enamoured with in recent years. Again, I think he has a good arm and is a solid athlete, but does Mendoza have the same physical gifts as a guy like Josh Allen? No. That being said, the Allen we know now isn’t the same guy who came out of Wyoming.\n\nQ: Who would be your top three head coach candidates and why?\n\nA: I wrote an article earlier this week, ranking my top five choices among the candidates the Raiders have interviewed. I’ll hyperlink it here, and a ‘related’ link is below if you want to check it out. Jesse Minter was No. 3 on my list, so now that he’s out of the running, I’d move Joe Brady into the top five.\n\nI still have questions about Mendoza’s fit in Brady’s offense, but he’s at least a younger offensive mind who has been coaching long enough that he should have a decent network to build a solid coaching staff. Plus, Brady does have a good track record of working with quarterbacks, developing Joe Burrow at LSU and helping Josh Allen become an MVP.\n\nQ: Of the remaining HC candidates that the Raiders are considering, who do you think would be the best fit for Mendoza?\n\nA: Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak.\n\nMendoza would be a good fit in the Kyle Shanahan/Sean McVay style of offense, and Kubiak comes from that coaching tree. He worked for Shanahan in 2023, and the Kubiaks and Shanahans go way back. Their dads, Gary and Mike, worked together for over a decade in the 90s and early 2000s.\n\nPlus, Mendoza has been compared to a couple of quarterbacks that Kubiak has had success with: Kirk Cousins and Sam Darnold. I think there’s a reason why Seattle’s OC landing in Las Vegas has gained some steam this week. It seems like he’s Tom Brady and Co.‘s top guy.\n\nQ: Are there any particular candidates who are interviewing, or have interviewed, that you think will find the Raiders job most appealing? Or is the job kind of a back-burner for most of these candidates?\n\nA: It depends on how they view Mendoza. I think anyone from the Shanahan/McVay tree will find Vegas attractive, which includes Kubiak, Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur and San Francisco 49ers OC Klay Kubiak, all of whom have interviewed once. And I’m sure young guys like Rams’ passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase and Denver Broncos’ PGC Davis Webb would jump at the opportunity to be a head coach.\n\nAlso, the Raiders’ next head coach will have the unique ability to build the majority of the roster in their vision, while collaborating with Spytek, of course. That makes it an attractive destination in an ego-driven profession since the coach will get credit for turning the program around. However, candidates will need to have assurance that management will be patient, which is the biggest and hardest obstacle the Raiders have to overcome in this search. That means a long-term and expensive contract will have to be on the table.\n\nQ: What’s your opinion on Brandon Aiyuk? Should the Raiders try to trade for him and what would it take?\n\nA: I had a feeling this would come up at some point in the offseason, and my answer is: stay the hell away!\n\nAfter a long and drawn-out contract negotiation a few years ago, the 49ers paid Aiyuk the money he was looking for, and he still wasn’t happy. Also, he wasn’t playing well after getting a new contract in 2024 and is coming off a significant knee injury, so there isn’t a guarantee that Aiyuk is the same player he was two seasons ago. To me, the talent isn’t worth the headache, especially with a young locker room.\n\nWho do you think should return for us at O line next year and at what position, either as depth or starting? How do you think we should invest at O line in both FA and the draft?\n\nSidebar: I like Sanjit’s analysis on our O line (I like TDL and S&B Today, also). Do you listen to other podcasts, creators, and analysts, too? Just curious.\n\nA: Kolton Miller (left tackle) and Jackson Powers-Johnson (center) are the only guys I’d pencil in as starters next season. Caleb Rogers is capable of earning a starting spot, but I’d still bring in some competition at guard. On that note, I slide DJ Glaze inside and see how he performs there. Then, let Charles Grant battle with an offseason addition at right tackle.\n\nI wouldn’t mind keeping Alex Cappa as a veteran backup. He’s not that expensive, and at least the Raiders would have someone with starting experience to turn to in a pinch. Also, I’d be okay with letting Dylan Parham and Jordan Meredith walk in free agency. Those two don’t move the needle much for me.\n\nI touched on a few draft options above and listed a few free agent targets in last week’s column.\n\nI’ll listen to Q Myers’ Locked On Raiders podcast occasionally, but I don’t really tune into many other Raiders’ content creators. It’s nothing against them; there are some good ones out there from what I’ve seen. But I spend so much time focusing on the Raiders that if I’m going to listen to a podcast or watch any breakdowns, it’s going to be to find out what’s going on with other teams in the league or around the draft.\n\nQ: Do you think we can expect a decent bounce-back year from the Raiders’ offensive line with better coaching? Not saying they are stuffed with talent or anything, but it sounds like coaching was a huge limiter.\n\nA: I wouldn’t expect Las Vegas to have a dramatic turnaround next season, but I do think they can get back to being at least an average unit with better coaching. It’s pretty clear that Brennan Carroll was in over his head and not qualified for the position, especially after that ESPN report leaked a couple of weeks ago. If the Raiders can get someone who can develop JPJ, Rogers and Glaze, then all the line needs is one more guy on the interior to have a solid five in the trenches. And, as mentioned several times above, there are plenty of opportunities to add some talent this offseason!\n\nThat’ll do it for this week’s mailbag.

The offensive line will have a completely different look in 2026, as Alabama has added a multitude of linemen from the transfer portal in recent weeks.\n\nThe Tide have made a few changes to the coaching staff following the conclusion of the 2025 campaign, as Kapilovic’s two-year stint at Alabama has come to an end.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama football parts ways with offensive line coach Chris Kapilovic",

    "fullText": "Broncos Country!!! DNVRNortwoods here, and this week’s UFG is brought to us by quite possibly the Ultimate, Ultimate Fan – Doc LLV.\n\nDoc, I hope you’re ready to be on the opposite side of this equation; we need a guiding light to get us through these scary times.\n\n*editor’s note: So fun! And so hard, hahaha! But I am so ready. I usually send these really late to all of you (apologies again) and you turn it around in hours! It took me three days to finish this 😉 I also write too much, so there’s that. But it was super fun to try and say something worthwhile, so again, kudos to all of you who have done this for me every week with so much insight, humor and positivity! You rock, just like the UFG should and our Broncos team will on Sunday!\n\nKid and mom-friendly version….\n\nSo freakin' ready for this game!#NEvsDEN #AFCCG #BroncosCountry pic.twitter.com/mU2JbXN5pj\n\n— Doctor of Words (@docllv) January 24, 2026\n\nFirst and foremost….Docllv, can you please reassure all of Broncos Country that everything is going to be okay?! I know you were as devastated as the rest of us after the Bo news. Can you walk us through the emotional rollercoaster and why we shouldn’t panic?\ndocllv: When have we EVER really panicked over this team? Lol, just kidding. The thing is, I ALWAYS panic because I’ve rarely seen this team win easy. The Broncos just aren’t – and never have been – a put-em-away-early kind of team. I have died a thousand deaths watching them, and I’ll happily die a thousand more because the truth is, my favorite kind of win is the come-from-behind variety.\n\nLast week’s OT roller coaster was so close to being the worst game ever but quickly became the best game ever (and an hour later was the biggest bummer ever, but we’ll talk about that).\n\nTo your actual question, one of my favorite MHR commenters on here years ago [Whorfin] used to say that he never worries because that’s just a waste of emotions. As fans we have no control over the game OTHER than to support the guys who do. And anyone who has played even the lowest level of sport knows that when the crowd is behind you, you feel invincible…and often play above your pay grade. With a coach who will make sure this team is prepared and a Mile High crowd that is beyond energized (10 years of pent-up frustration coming through this season!) there is no reason to panic.\n\nBefore we move from Bo-Lieving to Stiddytown how would you rate Bo Nix’s season? Are we living in an era that will rival Elway’s and Manning’s Broncos?\ndocllv: Absolutely. I think Bo has consistently shown growth, and that is all you can ask of a young QB, in my opinion. These guys drafted at the top of the first round generally go to bad teams, and being successful takes a coach with vision and patience to improve the whole team while also developing a promising quarterback. Bo (and Broncos Country) were fortunate to have Sean Payton providing just that. I don’t love everything Payton does, but I do love how he has brought along Bo – making the game manageable as he has added more to the playbook and to Bo’s responsibilities. And I love how he defends his QB. That, along with Bo’s natural talent, leadership quality and clear football IQ, will ensure success for a long time to come.\n\nThe narrative around Denver media is this team is going to raise their game for Bo and rally behind Stiddy. How does that look for these Denver Broncos? Should we expect max effort plays and the cleanest game out of our offense yet?\ndocllv: 100%…but that would be the case even if Bo were playing. It’s the playoffs and every team is good, so to win, the mindset has to be playing to your highest level. And for this Broncos squad, that means the defense has a monster game – sacking the QB, pressuring him from the edge and up the middle into making bad throws, DBs preventing catches and taking the ball away (come on, Hufanga, CATCH those!) – and the offense moving the ball INTO THE END ZONE.\n\nI think it’s clear that Stidham is not the typical backup – a has-been starter relegated to second-string, or an inexperienced rookie being thrust into the limelight for the first time. Instead, he is a talented and smart QB who has the trust of Payton, and that says a lot. I don’t think our offense will be quite as dynamic on Sunday, but I definitely trust Payton to have a game plan ready that Stiddy is comfortable with. Also, I’d be leaning on Davis Webb for designing plays this week. Webb called a great preseason game for Stidham, who went 16-of-23 for 240 yards and two touchdowns. I know it was preseason, but it was excellent play design for Stiddy, and I’d recommend utilizing him as much as possible this week.\n\nAlex Singleton was asked his thoughts about Jarrett Stidham…right as Stiddy walks by 😆 pic.twitter.com/IruvZQQRiZ\n\n— RG 📷 (@RyanGreeneDNVR) January 22, 2026\n\nThis has all the trappings of a legacy game for Sean Payton, what does he dial up to pick apart the Pat’s Defense? How confident are you that he will make this offense look like it hasn’t skipped a beat?\ndocllv: Those are hard questions, nice job!! I’ll start with the second. I’m confident. As I said above, Payton has a lot of trust in Stidham, which is why he paid him the big bucks to keep him here. And since Stidham has been here all three years of Payton’s tenure, I am sure they have a great working relationship that I think will be reflected in the offensive game plan. Andrew Mason shared an interesting stat – Sean Payton is 12-8 when forced to play a backup due to injury. But that record is 12-3 when the backup has been on his roster for at least two seasons.\n\nI am sure there will be a few more hiccups than usual but hopefully nothing major. And I’ll reiterate again … get Davis Webb on that mic!\n\nAs for the game plan itself…don’t do anything stupid or brand new. Use shifts, and motions and play action and all the things that make this offense tough to defend. Utilize McLaughlin’s speed and Harvey’s ability to catch out of the backfield. And for heaven’s sake, throw to Courtland Sutton. The guy is money.\n\nI was just listening to Troy Renck talk about his conversation with Bill Parcels this week where he asked him what he told the team when Jeff Hostetler came in late in the season for an injured Phil Simms to help the Giants win Super Bowl XXV. Parcels told Renck, “I said to them, if we lose this game it will not be because of Jeff Hostetler, it will be because you dumb mother fuckers did something fucking stupid, excuse my language.” Hahaha. Aside from always loving a well-placed f-bomb, I love what that quote means – the coach trusts the QB to run the game plan so everyone else needs to do the same and do their jobs.\n\nAlso, no WR screens. I fucking hate those (no apologies for my language!)\n\nHow bad do you want to see J.K. Dobbins back?! What does he do for this offense, especially with Stiddy at the helm? Do you want to see him back next year?\ndocllv: I love Dobbins and it was clear our rushing attack took a big hit when he went down. So I would have LOVED to have him on the field Sunday but only if he was 100%. So I’m glad to see the coaches playing it smart by holding him out. RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin can run the ball (if Payton will run the ball, lol). I’d prefer to have a very healthy Dobbins down the road if he’s not able to give it everything and stay healthy this week. And I would definitely have him back next year on another short-term deal.\n\n\"It truly is an honor.\"\n\n1-on-1 with AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year finalist @nikkkkbonitto: pic.twitter.com/zdgixbNtYY\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) January 23, 2026\n\nNik was in full Von playoff form, likely taking out some rage on his all-pro snub. JMAC was the unsung hero of the game and DEFINITELY earned a bag this offseason. Who do you have in those roles on D this week and what kind of effect will they have on the game?\ndocllv: Definitely whichever DB is covering Boutte. I don’t want to see one of those long bomb, one-handed catches to the end zone on Sunday that Maye-Boutte had last week against the Texans. But honestly, given all the weapons New England has on offense, there’s not one player who needs to step up. They all do and need to recognize when they have an opportunity to make a play – just like PJ Locke and JaQuan McMillian did. We always expect big things from Pat Surtain or assume the play will be in front of Riley Moss, but it’s the other guys being alert that will also surprise the Patriots. I would love to see Greenlaw have a big game and always love watching Hufanga hit people. But honestly, what I really want, is a Bonitto Special where he intercepts the pass in stride and just heads into the end zone. That play last season is one of my favorites ever.\n\nIs Sean Peyton finally going to play his Joker card (Stiddy and Engram connection)? What skill position players are going to help most raise Stiddy’s game?\ndocllv: Based on the whole season, I would say “doubtful” 😉 BUT…I was reminded that when Davis Webb called the game for Stiddy in the preseason, Engram asked to play in the game, where he got a 58-yard TD on the first series. Maybe he will ask Webb to add a few plays for him and that will get this whole thing jump-started for real.\n\n“MVP Candidate” Drake Maye has been sacked 10 times, thrown 2 interceptions, and fumbled 6 times in the Patriots two playoff games this year. After the turnover-fest we had last week, how do we embarrass Maye again this week? What tweaks do you need to see out of this Defense?\ndocllv: Our defense is made to embarrass Maye. Between Bonitto and Cooper and the guys in the middle (shout out to Zach Allen, Malcolm Roach and John Franklin Myers), sacks are in the design. There is a reason this team has multiple guys with 7+ sacks on the season. I am currently watching the 2015 AFC Championship (thank you, NFL Network!) and Simms makes a comment that Tom Brady normally has easy throws, but against the Broncos he has “been uncomfortable all day.” That’s exactly how Maye needs to feel. Under constant pressure, nobody open, no good running lanes on the handoffs. If he can beat us then, well…in Parcell’s words, somebody did something f-ing stupid.\n\nSpeaking of tweaks, who are the Pat’s biggest threats on Offense? How do they match up against Denver’s Defense and who should we focus on taking away?\ndocllv: Because I talk too much, I hinted at this already, but I think their running backs could be a problem, and it’s clear that Kayshon Boutte is a big deep threat. And I’m always nervous about tight ends against us.\n\nThe Pats (Josh McDaniels) “know Stiddy” … does that really hold water after he’s been in our system for so many years? Honestly, does anyone know Stiddy? Doc please tell us what we need to know about Stiddy.\ndocllv: He was Payton’s first signing as head coach of the Broncos. That says something. As for tape on him, I agree with the coach that the Patriots are defending the offense, not just Stidham, so it’s not that big of a deal that they haven’t seen a ton of game film with Stidham at QB. The game film they will study is Sean Payton’s offense. So hopefully Payton is on his A-game (and I’ll say it again…consults Davis Webb!) because that’s who the Patriots need to worry about. Peter Schrager on ESPN’s “Get Up” noted that Payton lives for these moments – the “crisis” moments to get a team to believe in itself.\n\nAll we need to know about Stiddy is that he is confident in himself, which means this moment won’t be too big for him. Payton will get him ready and as Alex Singleton noted, it’s not like Stidham is walking into the stadium Sunday and someone’s handing him a playbook to teach him about football. I think we’ll see a good QB take advantage of his opportunity. Everyone compares him to Foles or Hostetler. I like to think of him as Kubiak. Those of us old enough to watch Elway in the 80s and 90s remember being really confident if Gary Kubiak had to come in. Kubiak was smart and good and not nearly as flashy or comeback capable as Elway, but he had the clutch gene and was able to compete. That’s what you hope for.\n\nIs Nick Foles a secret Denver fan? If he’s right and Stiddy takes us all the way down Lombardi Lane, how will Stiddy go down in Broncos history?\ndocllv: A two-game starting championship QB who will be signing a big check for a different team soon after.\n\nDenver is 4-0 against the Pats at home in the Playoffs, does that mean anything? How do you feel about streaks like that? Finally, if Denver keeps the streak alive and lands in the Superbowl, what can we expect from all you amazing writers at MHR?!\ndocllv: I definitely think it means something because players are just as affected as fans are (if not moreso) by superstitions and mental blocks. If the Patriots are spending any time worrying about how loud the crowd will be or how much altitude will affect them because “it’s tough to play in Denver,” then it’s already in their heads – and that always helps. That said, this is a well-coached team by an experienced former player, so I don’t think it will mean as much as I’d like it to, lol.\n\nAlso, as Ted Lasso reminds us, don’t talk about streaks 😉\n\nIf we make it to the Super Bowl who do you want to face?\ndocllv: I am superstitious enough to not want to make any predictions beyond this week. It’s weird, I know. But I don’t want to jinx us.\n\nI’ve seen this all making the rounds on social media… if we win it all is… “this one for Bo!”?\ndocllv: You keep making me talk about the future I don’t want to jinx!!! 😉 Whenever the Broncos win, it’s for Broncos Country.\n\nList of teams to accomplish this feat in consecutive seasons since 1982:\n\n🏈 Los Angeles Raiders (1984-86)\n🏈 Denver Broncos (2024-present)\n\n*end of list* | #BroncosCountry pic.twitter.com/wszTzplqkM\n\n— NFL GameDay (@NFLGameDay) January 22, 2026\n\nStats for Stiddy?  18/27, 180 yards, 2 TDs\n\nStats for each Broncos RB?  RJ Harvey, 75 yards (30 receiving), 1 TD; Jaleel McLaughlin, 60 yards\n\nNumber of yards receiving/TDs for the receivers?

And who’s Lincoln?  I don’t really want to answer this question, lol. I ask it of everyone else and I always think, “oh that’s a great player I hadn’t thought of” … Four is just not enough and a “Hall of Fame” is much easier to figure out! But in the spirit of what the four stand for – birth, growth, development and preservation – I’ll go with Floyd Little (birth); Randy Gradishar (growth); John Elway (development); and Champ Bailey/Peyton Manning (preservation). Peyton is obviously Lincoln 😉 but I really want to include Champ.\n\nFavorite win this season? Last week against the Bills. OMG.\n\nFavorite non-Super Bowl Winning Denver QB? Jake the Snake. Love that guy’s moxie.\n\nFavorite player on this roster? I don’t have one favorite player. I love this entire team. And I mean that. I would never boo the team or a player for not playing well. I know they are out there trying to win every single play and every single game and I love how much they care…especially the few guys who have been there for years of losing (Sutton, Bolles) and understand really how much it means to win.\n\nFavorite Super Bowl win? This is a tough one. I got to cover SB50, so that was an experience of a lifetime. But, I think the SB32 win was more impactful. After so many losses, we were due. And it was such an exciting game that came down to the last play. I named my new lab puppy “Mobley” because of that game. I can still see that 4th-and-6 pass get batted down and remember spilling every drink in the room of my Packers fan friends when I started screaming and jumping up and down.\n\nFavorite win over the Patriots? Easy. The 2015 regular season game where CJ Anderson demolished all Patriots hopes of a win with his walk-off touchdown in OT. I had to write the game recap for MHR for the first time and it was impressed upon me that I had to get it published within three seconds of the end of the game for SEO. I was so nervous about doing that I kept trying to guess what the end score would be once we went to overtime – at first I thought we’d win by 3, then I thought we’d lose by 3, then I figured we’d get a field goal to win and then CJ ran all the way in…and then in the moment of elation I couldn’t remember if we’d kick an extra point or not so I wasn’t sure if we were winning by six or seven! The drama. It was the most exciting win that I couldn’t get too excited about because I had to publish a story, lol. A month later, I was able to get really excited for the AFCCG, which was a close second favorite.\n\nFavorite non MHR-affiliated Denver Broncos writer/reporter? Locally, Andrew Mason. Mase is absolutely the smartest guy out there covering the Broncos. I also love Nick Kosmider at The Athletic. Nationally, I like anyone who picks the Broncos.\n\nI grew up in Fort Collins, and my parents were always big sports fans. My dad, a native of Texas, was a Cowboys fan but loved cheering on the local team, so naturally we watched the Broncos every Sunday. When I was 7 and the Broncos played the Cowboys in Super Bowl XII, my dad was conflicted but cheered on the Broncos (though I’m sure he was secretly happy for Staubach in the end). That year I had just moved to a new school and scored instant cool points by knowing Orange Crush trivia in our PE class, making for a much easier introduction to a new school in the middle of the year. So the Broncos and I have been best friends ever since. We’ve gone through some tough times but they always come back to reward me for sticking with them.\n\nOur legacy means everything.\n\nLet's #ClimbHigher. pic.twitter.com/9TUNMtC0dr\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) January 24, 2026",

    "fullText": "The Premier League have officially confirmed the match officials for Arsenal’s match against Manchester United on Sunday, with Craig Pawson to referee the clash assisted by Lee Betts and Mat Wilkes. Tom Bramall will be the fourth official.\n\nPaul Tierney will be on VAR, with Dan Robathan completing the officiating team as the assistant VAR.\n\nPawson had an eight-month stretch without refereeing Arsenal games after he dismissed Myles Lewis-Skelly against West Ham United in February.\n\nThough Lewis-Skelly did bring down Mohammed Kudus and arguably denied a goalscoring opportunity, the foul on the halfway line was far from a “clear” opportunity, and Kudus elbowed Lewis-Skelly in the head before the foul.\n\nIn Pawson’s defence, he initially showed a yellow card, only for VAR to recommend an upgrade. But both Pawson and the VAR official missed Kudus’ initial offence whilst conducting their reviews.\n\nPawson then returned to refereeing Arsenal in November, taking the Gunners’ away draw to Sunderland.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side are now on a three-game run without a win under Pawson, but they do have a positive record overall, with 18 wins, five draws, and 11 defeats with the official.\n\nThe last time he refereed this particular fixture of Arsenal vs Manchester United, the Gunners won 3-1.",

    "title": "Should I Form an LLC or Register a Domain First?",
    "description": "Not sure if you should claim a domain or form your LLC first? Use our guide to prioritize these goals for your unique business needs.",
    "fullText": "Starting a business—and not sure if you should get a domain or form your LLC first? Dive into our guide to learn how these steps are connected, and which to prioritize first for your unique business needs.\n\nDeciding whether to register a domain or form an LLC first can feel like a chicken-and-egg situation. In reality, it’s just a matter of balancing competing priorities. You need to secure a legal business name with the state (where options may be limited) and snag a domain name that’s short, easy to remember, and on brand for your business (also no small feat). Should your business name and domain name match? And which name should you prioritize at the beginning stages of starting a business?\n\nWe have answers. In this guide, we’ll help you vanquish indecision and get on the track to starting a business with a great website.\n\nYour business name is what appears on official paperwork you file with the state. The state usually has specific requirements about words that must be included in your name based on the type of business you’re running. For example, many states require LLCs to include an abbreviation like “LLC” or even the phrase “Limited Liability Company.” This is considered the legal name of your business.\n\nYour domain name is what people type into their browser’s address bar when they want to visit your website. It does not have to include identifying words like “LLC.” In fact, there’s no requirement for it to match your business name at all. Domain names can only use letters, numbers, and hyphens.\n\nThere’s no requirement—legal or otherwise—for your business name and your domain name to match. That’s because your business name and your domain name serve two very different purposes.\n\nYour business name is your entity’s legal name. You’ll use it to do legal stuff, like enter into contracts, open business bank accounts, and pay taxes.\n\nYour domain name, on the other hand, serves as the web address for your company. It’s what people who come across your business online—on social media or via search engines—will associate with your business.\n\nBoth names are key parts of your business’s brand—a fancy marketing term that really just means the personality or identity of your business. You’ll want to choose the business name and a domain name that best serve these two functions. This means your domain name and business name may or may not match.\n\nThis is a slightly different question, and the answer is complicated. In some cases, it’s best for your domain name and business name to match—or at least get as close as possible. But many businesses use a completely different domain name than company name. Here, we’ll break down a few scenarios.\n\nWhen your business name and domain name shouldn’t match:\n\nWhen your business name and domain name should match (or get close):\n\nIf you’ve determined your business name and your domain name should more or less match, but your the domain name that matches your business name isn’t for sale, you have a few options. You can:\n\nSuppose you buy a domain name that doesn’t match your business name. After some time, you find that you actually like your domain name more than your business name. In fact, you’d like to do all your business—not just the online side—under your domain name.\n\nIn that case, you don’t have to form a whole new LLC or change your LLC’s name. You just need to register a DBA (doing business as) name with the state. A DBA is like a nickname for your business, and filing one is usually pretty inexpensive (depending on where you live).\n\nRemember that registering a DBA is not the same as registering a legal entity—a DBA affords you no liability protection.\n\nSo should you register a domain or form an LLC first? Like other aspects of your business, there’s no single answer that applies to all businesses and situations. Here’s a list of questions and considerations worth keeping in mind as you work through your decision.\n\nLet’s say you’re starting a business that only sells items or services online and does not have a brick-and-mortar location. In this case, the success of your business depends on your online presence and branding, and a solid domain name is a key part of that. You should secure a domain name first and worry about naming your business second.\n\nHow do you find out if a domain name is available? Go to any domain registrar – like domainregistry.com – and type in the domain name you’re seeking. You’ll get an answer in seconds.\n\nA brick-and-mortar business may find that deciding on a business name and forming an LLC first makes the most sense. To find out if your desired LLC name is available, visit your state’s secretary of state’s website. There, you’ll find a database of all the businesses registered in your state, and you can search to see if your desired name is available.\n\nIf someone’s already claimed your name, you’ll need to find an alternate one. The good news is that when you do form an LLC, you’ll prevent anyone else in your state from coming along and using the exact same business entity name.\n\nAn LLC is a type of business entity. When you form an LLC you gain liability protection in the separation of your business assets from your personal assets. That keeps someone from claiming personal assets (like your home) in a lawsuit they file against your LLC.\n\nThere are some businesses that will need liability protection sooner than others. For instance, any establishment that serves food has to worry about customers getting food poisoning or having allergic reactions. A gym has to worry about people getting hurt while doing deadlifts. A miniature golf course has to worry about golfers getting boinked in the head by a runaway golf ball. However, a freelance writer may find that they’re willing to put off getting liability protection until after their website goes live.\n\nDon’t wait. You can buy a domain name, then park it for a while before you turn it into a professional website for your business. Buying a domain and holding off on developing it fully is a common practice known as domain parking. Because you’ll be competing for a good domain name with people around the world and not just in your home state, you don’t want to snooze on an opportunity you might not have again.",

    "description": "The shooting comes two weeks after the killing of Renee Good by an immigration agent in the city, which sparked protests",
    "fullText": "A man was shot and killed by an immigration agent in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, the second fatal shooting in a little over two weeks by federal authorities in the city.\n\nThe incident follows the Jan. 7 killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, by a federal agent, and comes a day after mass protests in the city over a surge of immigration officers and sweeping raids across the state.\n\nA video of the incident, which took place at around 9 am, appears to show a large group of federal agents struggling with a man before one of the agents pulls a gun and fires several shots. The agent continues to fire while the man lies motionless on the floor.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the man died soon after. The victim was a 51-year-old man, according to hospital records obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement that it was carrying out a \"targeted operation\" when an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. DHS claimed the officers attempted to disarm the suspect, \"but the armed suspect violently resisted.\"\n\n\"Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene,\" the statement continued.\n\nA separate video showing the lead-up to the fatal shooting shows the man standing still, filming a group of federal officers with his phone, before an agent approaches and pushes him backwards. The video then cuts before the shooting takes place.\n\nThe shooting prompted a wave of anger from local politicians, many of whom have been calling for the Trump Administration to bring an end to its immigration surge following weeks of violent encounters with Minnesotans, including the use of pepper spray and the arrest of peaceful protesters.\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz called the shooting \"sickening\" and called on President Trump to end his immigration crackdown in the state.\n\n“I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. Minnesota has had it. This is sickening,” Walz said in a post on X.\n\n“The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”\n\nDemocratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said: To the Trump administration and the Republicans in Congress who have stood silent: Get ICE out of our state NOW.\n\nThe City of Minneapolis said in a statement on X that the shooting had taken place in the area of 26th Street W and Nicollet Ave.\n\n\"We are working to confirm additional details. We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,\" it added.\n\nA few hundreds 300 protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting in south Minneapolis by noon, where they scuffled with federal agents who had blocked off the intersection. Protesters screamed \"I smell Nazis\" at the federal agents and shouted at them to \"go home.\"\n\nThe agents deployed tear gas and used pepper-spray as they fought running battles with protesters.\n\nThe shooting comes a day after thousands took to the streets across Minnesota on Friday, closing down businesses and calling out of work in a mass protest against the Trump Administration’s immigration crackdown in the state.\n\nThe “Ice Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth and Freedom” demonstration, organized by community leaders, members of the clergy, and labor unions, called for a “no work, no school, no shopping” economic blackout.",

    "title": "US Vaccine Panel Chair Says Polio and Other Shots Should Be Optional",
    "description": "Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who leads the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said a person’s right to refuse a vaccine outweighed concerns about illness or death from infectious diseases.",
    "fullText": "Offering a startlingly candid view into the philosophy guiding vaccine recommendations under the Trump administration, the leader of the federal panel that recommends vaccines for Americans said shots against polio and measles — and perhaps all diseases — should be optional, offered only in consultation with a clinician.\n\nDr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who is chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that he did have “concerns” that some children might die of measles or become paralyzed with polio as a result of a choice not to vaccinate. But, he said, “I also am saddened when people die of alcoholic diseases,” adding, “Freedom of choice and bad health outcomes.”\n\nIn the case of an infectious disease, a personal choice to decline a vaccine may also affect others, including infants who are too young to be vaccinated or people who are immunocompromised. But a person’s right to reject a vaccine supersedes those risks, Dr. Milhoan said.\n\n“If there is no choice, then informed consent is an illusion,” he said. “Without consent it is medical battery.”\n\nThe polio and measles vaccines are widely acknowledged as staggering successes in public health, credited with preventing disability and millions of deaths worldwide. The polio vaccine in particular has strong bipartisan support, including from President Trump and some Republican lawmakers, who have invoked the horrific time before the vaccine was available.\n\nBut Dr. Milhoan said that making the vaccines optional, rather than requiring them for entry into public schools nationwide, as is now the case, would ultimately restore trust in public health.\n\nOutside experts had sharp words for Dr. Milhoan, saying the changes in vaccine policy he was suggesting would result in unnecessary deaths among children.\n\n“He has no idea what he’s talking about,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the infectious disease committee at the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\n“These vaccines protect children and save lives,” Dr. O’Leary said. “It’s very frustrating for those of us who spend our careers trying to do what we can to improve the health of children to see harm coming to children because of an ideological agenda not grounded in science.”\n\nDr. Milhoan outlined some of his views in an episode of the podcast “Why Should I Trust You?” that aired on Thursday. In the podcast, he said polio and measles were not the threat they once were in the United States because of improvements in medicine and sanitation, rather than the vaccines alone, echoing comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He described himself as “pulling back the curtain” on the risks of vaccines.\n\nIn a series of text messages later on Thursday and Friday, he elaborated on his view that personal autonomy was paramount. The vaccine committee may “not necessarily” recommend that all vaccines be optional, he added, but it is charged with “re-evaluating all of the vaccine products including risks and benefits” and may make significant changes to the roster of childhood vaccines over the coming year.\n\nAny changes the committee makes would add to a significant reshaping of the vaccination schedule announced this month by federal health officials. Bypassing the process that the committee has long followed for vaccine recommendations, Mr. Kennedy and his appointees debuted a schedule that reduces the number of recommended immunizations to 11 from 17, and advises that the six vaccines that were dropped should now be administered only under “shared clinical decision making” — that is, after consultation with a health care provider.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on Dr. Milhoan’s views.\n\nSo far, states and insurance companies are continuing to follow the previous vaccination schedule, which is still endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical organizations. All 50 states and the District of Columbia require children to be vaccinated against most of the 17 diseases to attend public schools.\n\nChildren can be exempted from the shots for medical or other reasons. Still, requiring routine shots for school entry is “heavy handed” and “authoritarian,” Dr. Milhoan said on the podcast. “What we are doing is returning individual autonomy to the first order — not public health but individual autonomy to the first order,” he added.\n\nDr. Helen Chu, a vaccine expert at the University of Washington in Seattle and a former A.C.I.P. member, said the entire premise of a conflict between individual choice and public health was false.\n\n“It is true that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others, but the primary reason to receive a vaccine is to protect yourself,” she said.\n\nNoel Brewer, a vaccine expert and previous member of the committee, said Dr. Milhoan seemed to misunderstand the purpose of the vaccine committee.\n\n“A.C.I.P. makes recommendations for what is best for the whole population,” Dr. Brewer said. As for individual autonomy, all vaccines are already delivered with patient consent, he noted.\n\n“For me, autonomy means being able to have my children go to the grocery store or go to preschool and not be stalked by a vaccine-preventable disease that will kill them,” he added. “Ensuring high uptake of vaccines through school-entry requirements protects my child and other children.”\n\nDr. Milhoan seemed to approach the committee’s work from his perspective as a medical doctor, rather than as a champion of public health, said Dr. Mark Abdelmalek, a surgeon and co-host of the podcast.\n\nDuring the wide-ranging interview, Dr. Milhoan also claimed he had seen data that suggested “a very large death signal in children” from the Covid vaccine, referring to at least 10 deaths that the Food and Drug Administration is investigating but has not yet made public. He said there were emerging concerns that repeatedly stimulating the immune system with multiple vaccines might increase the risk of allergies, asthma and eczema.\n\nLarge studies have dismissed that claim, but Dr. Milhoan said he trusted his own observations over what “established science” might suggest about vaccines.\n\n“He views the vaccines as the threat,” Dr. Abdelmalek said.",

    "description": "Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process underlying inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals.",

    "fullText": "For New Yorkers who visit the Coney Island boardwalk every summer, there is one spot they almost always stop at after hours of walking and riding amusement park rides under the hot sun.\n\nThe place is nothing fancy, just a simple yellow-and-red storefront with green-and-white striped awnings and a huge white-and-green sign, but the smell of sizzling hot dogs is enough to draw millions of families in, turning it into an unmissable tradition for many.\n\nFounded in 1916, few could have predicted that what began as a small hot dog stand on Coney Island would grow into a global brand, renowned for its kosher beef hot dogs and for hosting the first-ever major hot dog-eating contest, now an annual Fourth of July spectacle. Today, the company sells its products in thousands of stores and operates hundreds of restaurants worldwide.\n\nAfter more than a century of success and becoming a New York icon, the company is now taking a major step that could reshape its future for years to come.\n\nSmithfield Foods has agreed to acquire Nathan's Famous (NATH) for approximately $102 per outstanding share in cash, valuing the deal at about $450 million, according to a press release.\n\nSmithfield has held an exclusive license to manufacture, distribute, market, and sell Nathan's Famous products within the U.S, Canada, and Sam's Club locations in Mexico since March 2014.\n\nWhile that license was set to expire in March 2032, the closing of this acquisition would allow Smithfield to secure full ownership of the Nathan's Famous brand and continue expanding across both retail and foodservice channels.\n\n\"Since entering into our licensing agreement in 2014, we have made significant investments to build and grow the Nathan's Famous brand,\" said Smithfield President and CEO Shane Smith in the press release. \"With our manufacturing scale, marketing strength, product innovation capabilities, and retail and foodservice channel expertise, acquiring Nathan’s Famous will allow us to take the brand to new heights.\"\n\nNathan's Famous CEO Eric Gatoff agrees with those sentiments, calling Smithfield's acquisition a \"natural fit\" for the brand's next phase of growth.\n\n\"As a long-time partner, Smithfield has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to investing in and growing our brand while maintaining the utmost quality and customer service standards,\" Gatoff added.\n\nSmithfield Foods (SFD) is an American food company and the world's largest pork producer and food-processing company, reporting over $14 billion in annual sales, according to its website.",

    "fullText": "In today’s CEO Daily: Diane Brady wraps up a week at Davos.\n\nThe big story: Trump sues Dimon and JPMorgan.\n\nThe markets: Mixed globally, with U.S. futures edging down.\n\nPlus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune.\n\nGood morning. When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink became co-chair of the World Economic Forum last year, he called up U.S. President Donald Trump and asked him to come speak, which he did. Fink also called Scott Galloway, an author, podcaster and NYU Stern marketing professor who has a very different view of what will make America great. As Galloway told me last night at our annual Fortune Global Leadership Dinner: “Larry Fink called me and said, ‘I want you to come.’ That was more than enough.”\n\nWith all the focus at WEF on heads of state—I even joined a media scrum after Trump’s meeting with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky—I thought I’d bring you some insights from my conversation with Galloway. (I first met Galloway in 2009 as a fellow mentor at the Kairos Summit organized by then Wharton student Ankur Jain, who went on to found Bilt Group.)\n\nGalloway last attended WEF in 1999. “The call sign of America back then was consumerism; it was more cooperation, alliances. Now, I feel the American brand is chaos, corruption, and coercion,” he said. “America has been the operating system of the world … There’s just a sense of unease … In 1999, we said ‘we want more,’ now we want to make sure things don’t get worse.” He praised Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech as the best of the week. “All 27 member EU states should have been sitting behind him,” Galloway said. “Right now, it’s like Germany and the 26 dwarves.”\n\nIn soliciting both Galloway and Trump to come to Davos, Fink understands the power of WEF in bringing opposing world views under one roof. I heard Saudi Tourism Minister HE Ahmed Al-Khateeb compare notes with Switzerland Tourism CEO Martin Nydegger, saw Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick chat with random people in the hall, including me, and witnessed dozens of global leaders find areas of commonality at our dinners and lunches. (That’s why I also appreciated having Deloitte, Aon, PMI, Toptal, and Workday sponsor editorial gatherings that let us create our own village greens.)\n\nOn Monday, I moderated a CEO salon to discuss the results of the 2026 Edelman Trust Barometer, in which 70% of this year’s respondents expressed an “insular” mindset; they don’t want to talk to, work for, or even be in the same space with anyone who doesn’t share their world view. Richard Edelman told me CEOs need to urgently address the sense of grievance that’s consuming the business world.",

    "description": "Quesst is the result of a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and NASA to build a supersonic aircraft that can fly over land. It just took off.",
    "fullText": "Humankind is always on a quest for speed: You can ride the fastest rollercoaster in the world, the Formula Rossa, at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, and the fastest land speed record was achieved in 1997 in Nevada when Andy Green hit 763 mph. But what about in the air? Humans first broke the sound barrier in 1947 when U.S. Air Force test pilot Chuck Yeager achieved supersonic flight in an experimental aircraft, the Bell X-1. This is an amazing feat considering that only 44 years prior, the Wright Flyer had a top speed of a mere 30 mph in the air. Now, a new generation of supersonic aircraft is under development, including Lockheed Martin's X-59.\n\nSupersonic flight reached the commercial sector decades ago with the Concorde, the first passenger plane that traveled at speeds faster than sound. The Concorde began ferrying passengers across the Atlantic Ocean in 1976 before being retired in 2003 for various reasons, including high costs. But the aircraft's sonic boom was also an issue, leading to operational restrictions. The Concorde was only allowed to fly over the ocean because the sonic boom was so disruptive, able to rattle and sometimes even break windows. Several aeronautics companies are at work on modern supersonic aircraft that mitigate that boom, including Lockheed Martin in partnership with NASA. Its X-59, a next-generation supersonic aircraft, recently completed a successful test flight. This single-seat plane is endeavoring to change the future of supersonic passenger flight.\n\nLockheed Martin's research and development unit, the Skunk Works division, developedthe X-59 in a partnership with NASA's Quesst Mission.  Quesst, by the way, stands for Quiet Supersonic Technology, and the mission is intended to prove that we can design technology that will \"fly supersonic, or faster than the speed of sound, without generating loud sonic booms,\" according to NASA. The goal is to prove to regulators that supersonic travel can be achieved more quietly in order to lift the ban on commercial supersonic travel over land.\n\nThe X-59 is a demonstrator prototype that has a wingspan of about 30 feet and is about 100 feet long. It's an experimental plane that is designed to separate the shock waves that make that loud sonic boom. This is achieved by managing the flow of air so that it isn't concentrated solely on the nose, but also flows over the hull and wings. This helps to direct the air wave up, resulting in a sonic boom that is more like the sound of a car door closing, at least to those of us on the ground. The first flight proved the X-59's flightworthiness and did not reach supersonic speeds, but Lockheed Martin reports that the aircraft is capable of speeds up to 925 mph. Testing will continue in collaboration with NASA, including eventual supersonic flights over populated areas.\n\nWith the success of the X-59, NASA hopes to encourage efforts to develop supersonic commercial aviation capable of overland flights, and Lockheed Martin and NASA are not the only ones at work on new, supersonic technology for commercial flight. Spike Aerospace is developing the Spike S-512 Diplomat, a supersonic jet intended for the business market. The company promises flights from New York City to London in under four hours. The aircraft is designed with the same goal as the X-59 — to reduce the sonic boom to a quiet thump through advanced engineering principles. The Spike S-512 Supersonic Diplomat is designed to hold up to 18 passengers. The company conducted test flights on a smaller prototype in 2017 but has yet to get the S-512 Supersonic Diplomat in the air. The company stated in 2025 that it is at work on an \"enhanced study to further refine the S-512 Diplomat's aerodynamics, cabin configuration, and low-boom performance.\"\n\nBoom Supersonic is also developing a supersonic commercial plane and already has orders from several airlines, including United Airlines and American Airlines. Its demonstrator aircraft, the Boom XB-1, achieved a supersonic flight in early 2025, a first step in the development of the larger Boom Overture. These supersonic planes are designed with the \"Boomless Cruise,\" which means that supersonic boom doesn't reach the ground. Ultimately, the Concorde is a closed chapter in aviation history, but Lockheed Martin and others continue to drive innovation in pursuit of commercial supersonic flight.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Guardian found OpenAI’s platform cited Grokipedia on topics including Iran and Holocaust deniers\n\nThe latest model of ChatGPT has begun to cite Elon Musk’s Grokipedia as a source on a wide range of queries, including on Iranian conglomerates and Holocaust deniers, raising concerns about misinformation on the platform.\n\nIn tests done by the Guardian, GPT-5.2 cited Grokipedia nine times in response to more than a dozen different questions. These included queries on political structures in Iran, such as salaries of the Basij paramilitary force and the ownership of the Mostazafan Foundation, and questions on the biography of Sir Richard Evans, a British historian and expert witness against Holocaust denier David Irving in his libel trial.\n\nGrokipedia, launched in October, is an AI-generated online encyclopedia that aims to compete with Wikipedia, and which has been criticised for propagating rightwing narratives on topics including gay marriage and the 6 January insurrection in the US. Unlike Wikipedia, it does not allow direct human editing, instead an AI model writes content and responds to requests for changes.\n\nChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when prompted directly to repeat misinformation about the insurrection, about media bias against Donald Trump, or about the HIV/Aids epidemic – areas where Grokipedia has been widely reported to promote falsehoods. Instead, Grokipedia’s information filtered into the model’s responses when it was prompted about more obscure topics.\n\nFor instance, ChatGPT, citing Grokipedia, repeated stronger claims about the Iranian government’s links to MTN-Irancell than are found on Wikipedia – such as asserting that the company has links to the office of Iran’s supreme leader.\n\nChatGPT also cited Grokipedia when repeating information that the Guardian has debunked, namely details about Sir Richard Evans’ work as an expert witness in David Irving’s trial.\n\nGPT-5.2 is not the only large language model (LLM) that appears to be citing Grokipedia; anecdotally, Anthropic’s Claude has also referenced Musk’s encyclopedia on topics from petroleum production to Scottish ales.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the model’s web search “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints”.\n\n“We apply safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms, and ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations,” they said, adding that they had ongoing programs to filter out low-credibility information and influence campaigns.\n\nAnthropic did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut the fact that Grokipedia’s information is filtering – at times very subtly – into LLM responses is a concern for disinformation researchers. Last spring, security experts raised concerns that malign actors, including Russian propaganda networks, were churning out massive volumes of disinformation in an effort to seed AI models with lies, a process called “LLM grooming”.\n\nIn June, concerns were raised in the US Congress that Google’s Gemini repeated the Chinese government’s position on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and China’s Covid-19 policies.\n\nNina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who has worked on LLM grooming, said ChatGPT’s citing Grokipedia raised similar concerns. While Musk may not have intended to influence LLMs, Grokipedia entries she and colleagues had reviewed were “relying on sources that are untrustworthy at best, poorly sourced and deliberate disinformation at worst”, she said.\n\nAnd the fact that LLMs cite sources such as Grokipedia or the Pravda network may, in turn, improve these sources’ credibility in the eyes of readers. “They might say, ‘oh, ChatGPT is citing it, these models are citing it, it must be a decent source, surely they’ve vetted it’ – and they might go there and look for news about Ukraine,” said Jankowicz.\n\nBad information, once it has filtered into an AI chatbot, can be challenging to remove. Jankowicz recently found that a large news outlet had included a made-up quote from her in a story about disinformation. She wrote to the news outlet asking for the quote to be removed, and posted about the incident on social media.\n\nThe news outlet removed the quote. However, AI models for some time continued to cite it as hers. “Most people won’t do the work necessary to figure out where the truth actually lies,” she said.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for xAI, the owner of Grokipedia, said: “Legacy media lies.”",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: German research into responses to health queries raises fresh questions about summaries seen by 2bn people a month\n\nHow the ‘confident authority’ of AI Overviews is putting public health at risk\n\nGoogle’s search feature AI Overviews cites YouTube more than any medical website when answering queries about health conditions, according to research that raises fresh questions about a tool seen by 2 billion people each month.\n\nThe company has said its AI summaries, which appear at the top of search results and use generative AI to answer questions from users, are “reliable” and cite reputable medical sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic.\n\nHowever, a study that analysed responses to more than 50,000 health queries, captured using Google searches from Berlin, found the top cited source was YouTube. The video-sharing platform is the world’s second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google.\n\nResearchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches, and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that AI Overviews was designed to surface high-quality content from reputable sources, regardless of format, and a variety of credible health authorities and licensed medical professionals created content on YouTube. The study’s findings could not be extrapolated to other regions as it was conducted using German-language queries in Germany, it said.\n\nThe research comes after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews responses.\n\nIn one case that experts said was “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company later removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches.\n\nThe SE Ranking study analysed 50,807 healthcare-related prompts and keywords to see which sources AI Overviews relied on when generating answers.\n\nThey chose Germany because its healthcare system is strictly regulated by a mix of German and EU directives, standards and safety regulations. “If AI systems rely heavily on non-medical or non-authoritative sources even in such an environment, it suggests the issue may extend beyond any single country,” they wrote.\n\nAI Overviews surfaced on more than 82% of health searches, the researchers said. When they looked at which sources AI Overviews relied on most often for health-related answers, one result stood out immediately, they said. The single most cited domain was YouTube with 20,621 citations out of a total of 465,823.\n\nThe next most cited source was NDR.de, with 14,158 citations (3.04%). The German public broadcaster produces health-related content alongside news, documentaries and entertainment. In third place was a medical reference site, Msdmanuals.com with 9,711 citations (2.08%).\n\nThe fourth most cited source was Germany’s largest consumer health portal, Netdoktor.de, with 7,519 citations (1.61%). The fifth most cited source was a career platform for doctors, Praktischarzt.de, with 7,145 citations (1.53%).\n\nThe researchers acknowledged limitations to their study. It was conducted as a one-time snapshot in December 2025, using German-language queries that reflected how users in Germany typically search for health information.\n\nResults could vary over time, by region, and by the phrasing of questions. However, even with those caveats, the findings still prompted alarm.\n\nHannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: “This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases.\n\n“Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “The implication that AI Overviews provide unreliable information is refuted by the report’s own data, which shows that the most cited domains in AI Overviews are reputable websites. And from what we’ve seen in the published findings, AI Overviews cite expert YouTube content from hospitals and clinics.”\n\nGoogle said the study showed that of the 25 most cited YouTube videos, 96% were from medical channels. However, the researchers cautioned that these videos represented fewer than 1% of all the YouTube links cited by AI Overviews on health.\n\n“Most of them (24 out of 25) come from medical-related channels like hospitals, clinics and health organisations,” the researchers wrote. “On top of that, 21 of the 25 videos clearly note that the content was created by a licensed or trusted source.\n\n“So at first glance it looks pretty reassuring. But it’s important to remember that these 25 videos are just a tiny slice (less than 1% of all YouTube links AI Overviews actually cite). With the rest of the videos, the situation could be very different.”",

    "fullText": "Do I have the flu or Covid? Why do I wake up feeling tired? What is causing the pain in my chest? For more than two decades, typing medical questions into the world’s most popular search engine has served up a list of links to websites with the answers. Google those health queries today and the response will likely be written by artificial intelligence.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, first set out the company’s plans to enmesh AI into its search engine at its annual conference in Mountain View, California, in May 2024. Starting that month, he said, US users would see a new feature, AI Overviews, which would provide information summaries above traditional search results. The change marked the biggest shake-up of Google’s core product in a quarter of a century. By July 2025, the technology had expanded to more than 200 countries in 40 languages, with 2 billion people served AI Overviews each month.\n\nWith the rapid rollout of AI Overviews, Google is racing to protect its traditional search business, which generates about $200bn (£147bn) a year, before upstart AI rivals can derail it. “We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace,” Pichai said last July. AI Overviews in particular were “performing well”, he added.\n\nBut overviews carry risks, experts say. They use generative AI to provide snapshots of information about a topic or question, adding conversational answers above the traditional search results in the blink of an eye. They can cite sources, but do not necessarily know when that source is incorrect.\n\nWithin weeks of the feature launching in the US, users encountered untruths across a range of subjects. One AI Overview said Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president, graduated from college in 2005. Elizabeth Reid, Google’s head of search, responded to criticism in a blog post. She conceded that “in a small number of cases”, AI Overviews had misinterpreted language on web pages and presented inaccurate information. “At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors,” she wrote.\n\nBut when those questions are about health, accuracy and context are essential and non-negotiable, experts say. Google is facing mounting scrutiny of its AI Overviews for medical queries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information.\n\nThe company says AI Overviews are “reliable”. But the Guardian found some medical summaries served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. In one case, which experts said was “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people who had serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. What AI Overviews said was normal could vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result and not bothering to attend follow-up appointments.\n\nAI Overviews about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nGoogle initially sought to downplay the Guardian’s findings. From what its own clinicians could assess, the company said, the AI Overviews that alarmed experts linked to reputable sources and recommended seeking expert advice. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a spokesperson said.\n\nWithin days, however, the company removed some of the AI Overviews for health queries flagged by the Guardian. “We do not comment on individual removals within search,” a spokesperson said. “In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nWhile experts welcomed the removal of some AI summaries for health queries, many remain worried. “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health,” says Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity.\n\n“There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” adds Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals.\n\nA new study has prompted more concerns. When researchers analysed the responses to more than 50,000 health-related searches in Germany to see which sources AI Overviews rely on most, one result stood out immediately. The single most cited domain was YouTube.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg, board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nIn medicine, it is not only where answers come from that matter, or their level of accuracy, but how they are presented to users, experts say. “With AI Overviews, users no longer encounter a range of sources that they can compare and critically assess,” says Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher in AI, health and law at the University of Basel. “Instead, they are presented with a single, confident, AI-generated answer that exhibits medical authority.\n\n“This means that the system does not merely reflect health information online, but actively restructures it. When that response is built on sources never designed to meet medical standards, such as YouTube videos, this creates a new form of unregulated medical authority online.”\n\nGoogle says AI Overviews are built to surface information backed up by top web results, and include links to web content that supports the information presented in the summary. People can use these links to dig deeper on a topic, the company told the Guardian.\n\nBut the single blocks of text in AI Overviews, combining health information from multiple sources, can cause confusion, says Nicole Gross, an associate professor in business and society at the National College of Ireland.\n\n“Once the AI summary appears, users are much less likely to research further, which means that they are deprived of the opportunity to critically evaluate and compare information, or even deploy their common sense when it comes to health-related issues.”\n\nExperts have raised other concerns with the Guardian. Even if and when AI Overviews do provide accurate facts about a specific medical topic, they may not distinguish between strong evidence from randomised trials and weaker evidence from observational studies, they say. Some also miss important caveats about that evidence, they add.\n\nHaving such claims listed next to one another in an AI Overview may also give the impression that some are better established than they really are. Answers can also change as AI Overviews evolve, even when the science hasn’t shifted. “That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough,” says Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity.\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that links included in AI Overviews were dynamic and changed based on the information that was most relevant, helpful and timely for a given search. If AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed some context, the company would use these errors to improve its systems, and also take action when appropriate, it said.\n\nThe biggest worry is that bogus and dangerous medical information or advice in AI Overviews “ends up getting translated into the everyday practices, routines and life of a patient, even in adapted forms”, says Gross. “In healthcare, this can turn into a matter of life and death.”",

    "fullText": "LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. control of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared barrels that had been servicing debt to China, lining up another potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American country's path out of default.\n\nAround a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that ​the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes - until the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nDebt experts said the ramifications of China's claim on the cargoes and any clash with ‌the United States could make it tougher for Venezuela to restructure its debt after a 2017 default and put at risk Beijing's cooperation in restructuring deals for other developing nations.\n\n\"Even under the best circumstances, this was going to be very messy - trying to disentangle where all ‌these creditors stand in the credit hierarchy,\" said Christopher Hodge, chief economist with Natixis and a former U.S. Treasury official.\n\n\"The fact that now America is controlling all the finances into and out of the country...this seems to be unprecedented to me, that we're going to have such entanglements, such opacity about the finances of a government,\" Hodge said.\n\nWhile Washington currently controls only oil sale proceeds, Hodge noted that these are Venezuela's main source of revenue.\n\nDocuments and sources from state-run oil firm PDVSA show three supertankers have been shuttling between Venezuela and China over the last five years carrying oil for interest payments under the terms of a temporary deal struck in 2019. But these shipments are only ⁠a fraction of Venezuela's total crude exports to China.\n\nAidData, a research lab at ‌the U.S. university William & Mary that tracks lending, said some cash proceeds from oil sent to China went into an account controlled by Beijing and on to service the debt - even as sanctions and default blocked payments to many of Venezuela's other creditors.\n\nThe Trump administration has now said that proceeds from the sale of Venezuela's oil will go into ‍a Qatar-based account controlled by Washington, potentially giving the U.S. President himself substantial leverage over which creditors get paid, and when.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the cargoes and debt payments, China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"has repeatedly stated its position\".\n\nBeijing condemned the redirection of Venezuelan oil exports during a January 7 news conference, adding \"legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected\".\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters that Trump had brokered an oil deal with Venezuela ​that \"will benefit the American and Venezuelan people\".\n\nThe Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at the \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which Caracas sold the crude previously, a U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nTraders managing Venezuelan oil ‌sales have offered some to Chinese refiners, but these are private market transactions, not intended as debt payments.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could yet make a deal with China. However, the planned U.S. takeover of Venezuela's oil sector and control of its revenue could upend the hierarchy of creditors, restructuring advisors warn.\n\n\"All of these things will have the practical effect of subordinating the claims of legacy debtholders,\" said global sovereign debt expert Lee Buchheit, adding it was unclear if Trump had the legal right to determine who gets paid first.\n\nSome $60 billion of Venezuela's bonds tipped into default in 2017, and a restructuring agreement is essential to enable it to borrow again and attract new ⁠investment.\n\nIn a typical restructuring, bilateral lenders come together and agree what losses they will accept, usually via the Paris Club of ​creditor nations. This sets the bar for the \"comparable\" losses private lenders - bond investors, banks and others - must take.\n\n\"Comparability of treatment will be ​a real challenge, particularly if the U.S. controls the use of oil revenues,\" said Mark Walker, a longtime sovereign debt advisor who previously worked on potential Venezuelan restructurings.\n\nIf the U.S. pushes China to swallow significant writedowns on its debt - and China digs its heels in - it could slow a restructuring and hinder Venezuela's economic recovery in the process.\n\nThat could ‍keep Venezuela \"in very dire straits during the foreseeable future\", said ⁠Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt with TT International, which holds Venezuelan bonds. In turn, this would limit how much the country can afford to repay to bondholders and other creditors.\n\nChina has little immediate leverage. Countries typically do not take other nations to court or arbitration over lending claims, Walker said, and would need to settle the situation \"on a government-to-government basis\".\n\nBut ramifications are possible: China is the ⁠largest bilateral lender to the developing world and its cooperation with the Paris Club has been crucial over the past decade. Beijing agreed restructuring terms via a platform called the Common Framework during Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia's debt restructuring talks.\n\n\"China's obvious leverage is to refuse ‌to cooperate in future Common Framework sovereign debt workouts until it feels that it has been treated fairly in Venezuela,\" Buchheit said. \"And that threat would have some force.\"",

    "description": "A 2-year-old girl was taken into ICE custody with her father on Thursday in Minneapolis and flown to Texas before she was returned to her mother Friday afternoon, a family lawyer said.",
    "fullText": "A 2-year-old girl was taken into ICE custody with her father on Thursday in Minneapolis and flown to Texas before she was returned to her mother Friday afternoon, a family lawyer said.\n\nThe child’s transfer to Texas took place despite a court order requiring her immediate release, according to the affidavit filed by the family attorney. The toddler’s father, identified as Elvis Tipan-Echeverria, remains in custody, the family’s attorney Kira Kelley told CNN Friday evening.\n\nThe father and daughter were on the same flight returning to Minnesota on Friday afternoon, Kelley said. “The child is out of detention as of this afternoon, and recovering from this horrific ordeal,” Kelley said.\n\nThe toddler and her father were initially being held at a federal facility in Minneapolis on Thursday after agents pursued their vehicle in a “targeted enforcement operation,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Friday. Lawyers for the family identified that facility as the Whipple Federal Building. The building has served as the backdrop of tense standoffs between agents and protesters following the death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good earlier this month.\n\nThe father and the toddler, identified only as C.R.T.V. in court documents, are citizens of Ecuador, and the child has lived in Minneapolis “since her arrival in the United States as a newborn” and has a pending asylum application.\n\nThe incident comes as outrage continues to grow over federal agents taking 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos in the driveway of his home in Minneapolis this week during the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the state. The boy was later put on a plane with his father to a family detention facility in Texas, where they remain.\n\nDuring the encounter with Tipan-Echeverria and his daughter, DHS said the father was “driving erratically with a child in the vehicle.” The father would then park the vehicle when federal agents attempted to take him into custody; however, “he refused multiple lawful commands to open his door or lower his window,” the agency said.\n\nThe toddler and her father had just returned home from the store and were inside their vehicle when ICE agents entered the backyard and driveway area of the home “without a warrant,” the affidavit says. One agent “broke the glass on the window” of Tipan-Echeverria’s vehicle while the toddler was also inside before the father and daughter exited the car, the affidavit says.\n\nCNN has reached out to DHS to inquire about the removal of the father and toddler to Texas, and the claim that agents had taken both without a warrant.\n\nVideo from the incident, which took place just after 1 p.m., shows people surrounding armed and masked federal agents and what appeared to be a federal vehicle. One man was heard yelling, “They were carrying a child in that!” seemingly referring to the federal vehicle.\n\nSome of the people at the scene started backing away as federal agents deployed what seemed to be a chemical agent. As the federal agents drove away, protesters continued to yell at them. “Help him!” one person yelled out.\n\nRoughly 120 people “surrounded the agents blocking them in and preventing exit” during the arrest, DHS said. “Agitators in the crowd then began to throw rocks and garbage cans toward the agents and child,” prompting agents to deploy crowd control measures to “safely clear the area,” the statement continued.\n\nDHS noted that obstructing and assaulting law enforcement is a felony and federal crime.\n\nFederal agents attempted to give the child to the mother, “who was in the area, but she refused,” DHS claimed. Federal agents “took care of the child who the mother would not take,” before the father and child were “reunited” at a federal facility, DHS said.\n\nHowever, the family’s lawyer said the child’s mother was standing outside and was near her husband as the couple were “calling out to each other” and the father tried to bring the child to her mother, but ICE agents “would not allow” it, the affidavit said.\n\nUpon seeing ICE agents approach her, the mother stepped back inside the house and was “terrified,” according to the affidavit. At that point, the father and his child were placed in the back of an ICE vehicle, which “did not have a car seat,” the affidavit said.\n\nThe allegations from DHS about the girl’s mother refusing to take custody of her child echo a similar statement from the agency in the case of Liam, saying the boy’s mother also refused to take custody of him. But Liam’s mother, according to Pastor Sergio Amezcua, who has been helping her with the case, was “terrified” of the agents outside her door.\n\nIn the case of Tipan-Echeverria and his daughter, attorneys for the family said: “Needless to say, she has no criminal history,” in an emergency petition to immediately release the toddler from federal custody to Kelley, who signed a notarized delegation of parental authority with the mother and custodial guardian.\n\nThe court granted the petition to immediately release the child, transferring custody of her temporarily to the attorney “for the purpose of retrieving the infant from immigration detention,” by 9:30 p.m. Thursday, the court documents said.\n\nThe court order determined “the risk of irreparable harm to maintain child in custody under the circumstances described in the pleadings are overwhelming.”\n\nThe father and his child were on a commercial airline flight to Texas by 8:30 p.m. that same day, despite the order issued at 8:11 p.m. that they should not be removed from Minnesota, their lawyer said in the affidavit, citing a conversation with a DHS counsel.\n\nThe agency then told the family’s attorney that it would fly the child back to Minnesota on Friday, the affidavit says. Kelley, the family lawyer, said she had not been able to contact her clients since they were taken into custody, according to the affidavit.\n\nA federal court order has barred ICE from sending the father outside of Minnesota while court proceedings play out, Kelley’s statement said.",

    "fullText": "I was sitting inside Estiatorio Milos in Hudson Yards at a table convened by ColorComm founder Lauren Wesley Wilson, who was hosting a conversation with media executives last December.\n\nHer closing question has stuck with me since: What's one piece of often unspoken advice that's truly helped in your career? For me, investing in age-gap friendships is one of the underrated ways I've sharpened my strategic thinking at work.\n\nAs I've settled into suburban life just outside New York City and climbed the corporate ladder, I've met wonderful people. They just weren't millennials. They were older; they were younger — but they each provided me with a petri dish of cultural understanding that I just couldn't get on my algorithms.\n\nI have found that age-gap friendships have given me cultural fluency that I could apply at work, too. They gave insight into different ways of thinking, alternative tastes in music and books, and firsthand context into so many of the themes we explore here at Business Insider — from entering the workforce to retirement.\n\nI'm not the only one who's noticed this. After meeting 97-year-old Bryan Hipwell at a bakery in 2020, 40-year-old writer Melissa Noble said her \"life is so much richer\" because of their age-gap friendship.\n\n\"Getting together with Bryan is like travelling back in time to another world,\" she wrote in a 2025 essay. \"Bryan was born in the 1920s and has lived an incredible life…Our conversations are often rich and varied, and inevitably, I end up learning something new.\"\n\nIf you're looking to get an edge at work — or in life — don't discount friendships outside your age bracket. Some of the most valuable relationships don't come labeled \"mentor.\"",

    "description": "My grandfather and I have always been close, but when I moved in with him, we bonded on a deeper level. We had more fun than I ever could've expected.",
    "fullText": "My earliest memory of my grandfather is sitting on his knee after he came home from work. I would count our cuts, scrapes, scabs, and bruises together — his from his construction job, mine from overzealous climbing at the playground.\n\nHe was the epitome of toughness in my eyes, and I aspired to amass an equal amount of superficial wounds that matched the ones that always covered his hands and arms like a warrior's tattoos.\n\nThis tough man would melt himself down in my presence, readily hunching his huge frame over so that I could inspect the newest additions to the collage on his skin. In gentle tones, he would express admiration for the minor injuries I proudly presented to him on my own little arms.\n\nThis is my grandfather in a nutshell: a hard, intimidating man to the rest of the world, but a marshmallow with me. This soft side of him was the reason I, at 28, decided to move in with him for a few months before starting a yearlong solo trip around the world.\n\nMy grandfather has always been an unwavering source of unconditional love in my life. But developing a sense of independence as a young adult — traveling, pursuing romantic relationships, growing my career, and generally building a life for myself — came at the cost of our relationship. A distance formed from the inevitable movements of two lives lived on different paths.\n\nI made what time I could for my grandfather, calling him at least once a week and visiting for weekend trips that always ended too soon. But as years passed after my grandmother's death, I felt an increasing urgency to do more with the time I had with my grandfather.\n\nTime was exactly what I got when I moved in with him. The pandemic turned \"just a few months\" into an almost two-year intergenerational living experiment.\n\nI had assumed when I moved in that we would spend most of our time at home, watching movies, cooking, and talking. I thought it would be quiet, and maybe even a little repetitive. I expected to take care of him, doing the household chores while he sat nearby chatting with me.\n\nBut he ended up taking care of me just as much as I tried to take care of him. He insisted on cooking dinners for me, so I could rest after working all day. His enthusiasm when I landed a client or assignment was always genuine and exuberant. He was happy to defer most household decisions to me and would surprise me with little treats when he ran errands. He almost always went along with my spontaneous, sometimes off-the-wall ideas like driving 14 hours to bottlefeed baby deer, adopting two kittens when one of his cats died unexpectedly, going on a mini-vacation to Rhode Island when our entire neighborhood lost power for days, or renovating the dining room into a high-scale playroom for his already spoiled cats.\n\nMost of all, my grandfather was always looking for ways to make me laugh. I had known he could be lighthearted and funny at times, but living with him let me see how silly he was willing to be. Laughing with him, getting to know him well enough to anticipate his laughter, and how to elicit it, created a connection between us that could not have been replicated in any other way.\n\nThis new dynamic allowed me to see him, for the first time, as a whole person outside his role as my grandfather. The first time he got choked up telling a story about his father, my world shifted. Outside my grandmother's funeral, I had never before seen my grandfather express that kind of depth of emotion. This man, who had always been unfazed by physical pain when I was a kid, carried grief and sorrow. It was a revelatory discovery, and encouraged me to listen more deeply when he spoke.\n\nI began to see him as a fascinating, multifaceted human with nuanced opinions, a complex history, and a surprising capacity for awe. This is how we went from being a grandfather and a granddaughter before I moved in to being best friends, co-conspirators, and equals as housemates.\n\nLiving together, especially through the pandemic, forced me to slow down and focus on the full person in front of me. I learned how to be a better listener. I learned that caring for loved ones takes different forms and depends on the individual's needs. Most importantly, I learned that investing in relationships over time creates a profound sense of connection.\n\nIt was a gift to learn these lessons in my late 20s. I am more intentional now about creating opportunities for quality time with my siblings, my partner, my grandparents, and my closest friends. Where possible, I no longer give them material gifts wrapped in pretty paper. Instead, I take them on adventures wrapped in laughter, silly photos, and meaningful conversations.\n\nThe bruises and cuts that now cover my grandfather's paper-thin skin are from living life in his 80s on blood thinners. Three decades later, we no longer sit together \"counting boo-boos,\" but we don't need to. Instead, we count the many memories we have made together, before we set off making new ones.",

    "title": "How Jane Fraser's 'star recruits' are helping Citi push ahead",
    "description": "After years of regulatory scrutiny, Citi is relying on senior hires from JPMorgan, Bank of America, and PwC to help the firm restore its reputation.",
    "fullText": "Citi has largely put the dog days of its multiyear transformation behind it, and CEO Jane Fraser signaled a shift from remediation to competition. The next step is cultural.\n\nIn a memo to employees last week, Fraser told Citi's more than 200,000 workers that \"the bar is raised\" and that it was time to ditch bad habits.\n\nWhen Fraser took over as Citi's chief executive in 2021, the bank was under intense scrutiny — bogged down by regulatory pressure, dated and weak technology, and investor doubts about whether it could still compete with Wall Street's most established names.\n\nFive years in, the stock is up about 40% over the past year and more than 80% over the past five — signs that investors are increasingly confident the firm has moved past its worst problems.\n\nCentral to the bank's efforts are three executives she hired to run businesses that are key to Citi's growth: investment banking, wealth management, and technology.\n\nBrian Mulberry, a portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, offered a sports analogy. \"If Jane Fraser is the quarterback, you need really strong skill positions — the receivers and running backs — to carry the ball over the goal line. These are the five-star recruits you'd want on that team,\" he told Business Insider. \"They're now on offense.\"\n\nCorporate dealmaker Viswas Raghavan has earned an industry reputation for pushing his people. Andy Sieg is the politically savvy denizen of the white-glove world of money management. And Tim Ryan is the steady hand from consulting, tasked with reinventing the bank's technology backbone.\n\nTheir rise has fueled some quiet succession chatter, though Fraser has given no indication she is considering stepping aside anytime soon.\n\nAs her no-nonsense year takes shape, here is how those three executives have fared in reshaping their units and how they're helping enforce her mandate.\n\nTitle: Executive Vice Chairman and Head of Banking\n\nSince Viswas \"Vis\" Raghavan took over Citi's investment banking business in June 2024, the unit is showing clear signs of momentum. Investment banking fees rose 35% year over year in 2025, with M&A revenues jumping 84%, according to Citi's fourth-quarter results.\n\nFraser highlighted some of the bank's most prominent client wins during the earnings call, including mandate work for Boeing, Pfizer, Nippon Steel, Johnson & Johnson, and private-equity firms Blackstone and TPG. Last year, Citi advised on Nippon Steel's roughly $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel, and on Charter Communications' announced nearly $35 billion combination with Cox Communications.\n\nAs head of banking, he oversees investment banking, corporate banking, and commercial banking — a sprawling remit that puts him at the vanguard of many of Citi's most financially important relationships.\n\nRaghavan is known in the industry for his high expectations. A 25-year JPMorgan veteran, Raghavan ran the firm's league table-topping investment banking franchise and oversaw its business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nLanding Raghavan's star power was a boon for Citi, Mulberry said. \"It absolutely matters who is backing the deal. Having that specific hire, with the confidence he brings\" in the eyes of the kinds of clients Citi wants, is a triumph for the bank, he added.\n\nHis credibility has helped him rebuild Citi's senior dealmaking ranks from rivals — especially JPMorgan.\n\nHe's lured JPMorgan bankers Drago Rajkovic and Guillermo Baygual to serve as global co-heads of M&A at Citi. Former Goldman Sachs partner David Friedland joined Citi last summer as co-head of North America investment banking.\n\nAnd the Wall Street Journal reported this week that former JPMorgan banker Alex Berkett, an ex-Paramount executive, would join to build Citi's media business.\n\nIn a note sent to employees of his division following earnings results last week, Andy Sieg said key focuses for the division would include leading the way in wealth advisory, deepening the integration of wealth offerings through the US retail bank, and incorporating AI into regular, daily workflows.\n\nHe shared a chart showing Citi Wealth revenue up 22% in two years. And he doubled down on Fraser's empathic message.\n\n\"For 2026, the bar has been raised,\" he wrote in the memo, which was viewed by Business Insider and confirmed by a Citi spokesperson. \"Jane speaks of scale for the bank; it will be our watchword as well. Strong, sustained organic growth will be ours if we double down on a set of strategic priorities,\" including fomenting \"a culture of ownership, accountability, and innovation,\" he added.\n\nSieg joined Citi in late 2023 to fix its wealth business. Sieg previously oversaw roughly 25,000 employees at Bank of America, where he had risen to the role of president of Merrill Wealth Management. The bank said wealth revenue grew 14% in 2025, according to fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nMulberry said Citi could rebuild wealth gradually over time, but argued that Sieg's background speeds things up. \"I think on the wealth management side, there's a fair argument you could do that organically,\" he said, \"but it helps to have a weighty name that's been successful in gathering assets at a place like Merrill Lynch.\"\n\nSieg has moved away from the single global private-bank head structure and made targeted hires, including former BlackRock portfolio manager Kate Moore to run the chief investment office and ex-Morgan Stanley executive Dawn Nordberg to deepen ties between wealth and banking. Citi has also added senior private bankers like Clinton Warren, a former JPMorgan private banker, to lead teams in the central US.\n\nHe has also had notable exits, including longtime private bank chief Ida Liu, who left in early 2025; and Valentín Valderrábano, chief operating officer for global wealth, whose exit was announced this month. He is following Liu to her new employer, HSBC.\n\nIt's also been reported that Sieg was the subject of an internal investigation into his conduct. A Financial Times report from October raised some questions about how the probe was conducted, but Citi told the FT that it approaches \"all internal complaints appropriately by conducting unbiased, thorough, and complete investigations\", and noted a \"commitment to a workplace where everyone is treated fairly and has equal opportunity to succeed.\"\n\nTitle: Head of Technology and Business Enablement\n\nCiti is pushing deep into artificial intelligence as it moves out of its long-running cleanup phase. More than 80% of Citi's transformation programs are now at or close to their target state, Fraser said on the latest earnings call.\n\nThat progress has enabled the bank to shift its focus toward growth and innovation. That next phase is being largely driven by Tim Ryan, who joined Citigroup in 2024 after spending nearly two decades at PwC, most recently as the consulting firm's US chair. Fraser tapped him to run technology and business enablement as Citi worked to move past years repairing outdated systems and addressing regulatory shortcomings. Early on, he was tasked with turning around Citi's substandard data management systems. Last summer, he was named one of the senior executives overseeing Citi's AI strategy.\n\nCiti has begun embedding artificial intelligence into core processes across the firm — from know-your-customer reviews to loan underwriting — starting with more than 50 of its largest and most complex workflows. Employees in 84 countries have already used the bank's proprietary AI tools tens of millions of times with adoption exceeding 70% across the workflow.\n\nAccording to the bank's third-quarter earnings report last year, Citi used generative AI to conduct one million automated code reviews, saving approximately 100,000 hours per week across its developer population. In the fall, Ryan wrote on LinkedIn that Citi had rolled out prompt training to help workers get more out of the tech, and cheered the bank's plans to rev the engine on agentic AI.\n\nBut competition is rife. The broader finance industry is being rapidly reshaped by AI, with powerhouse firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan spending billions to supercharge their workforces. The fight to secure top AI talent has intensified.\n\nCiti has spent years defined by baggage from its past that it's been under pressure to fix. Now, it has the rare chance to define what it wants to be.\n\nFraser wants her staff to know there's no time to lose. She concluded her memo with a clear directive: \"Let's get it done.\"",

    "description": "Some young people on TikTok are framing bankruptcy as a life-changing win. Financial experts say the process should be treated as a last resort.",
    "fullText": "For a growing number of Americans on social media, bankruptcy isn't a scarlet letter — it's a way to shed crushing debt and reset financially.\n\nOn TikTok, a wave of recent videos under the \"bankruptcy\" hashtag shows young people framing their personal bankruptcy filings as life-changing wins, drawing hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nIn clips viewed by Business Insider, individuals touted their bankruptcy filings as the \"greatest\" and \"best\" decision they've ever made, saying it allowed them to wipe out massive amounts of debt — sometimes tens of thousands of dollars — in just a few months.\n\nThis celebratory sentiment comes as personal bankruptcies rise nationwide. According to the American Bankruptcy Institute, citing data from Epiq Bankruptcy Analytics, individual bankruptcy filings have been climbing since 2022, with more than 533,000 cases last year.\n\nNearly 333,000 of those filings were Chapter 7 cases, the most common form of personal bankruptcy, which can eliminate most unsecured debts such as credit card balances or medical bills. Chapter 13 filings, which involve a repayment plan to pay down some or all debts, accounted for just over 200,000 cases.\n\nThough the complex legal process of bankruptcy can provide real monetary relief for some consumers, certified financial planners caution that it should be treated as a last resort due to long-term risks like higher borrowing costs, credit damage, and a mark on credit reports that can remain for up to a decade.\n\nGoing through bankruptcy can be a \"much more traumatic event than TikTok might make it sound like,\" Jesse Lineberry, the director of the Financial Planning Program at Virginia Tech, told Business Insider.\n\nBankruptcy laws exist to protect people who find themselves in financial situations where there is \"no way out,\" Lineberry added.\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcies stay on a credit report for 10 years, and Chapter 13 bankruptcies for seven years. This can hurt credit scores and make it harder to secure loans, housing, or even a job, financial experts said.\n\n\"Many private companies pull credit files before they make hiring decisions,\" said Lineberry.\n\nOnly 11 states in the country restrict employers from using credit history in most employment decisions.\n\nGiven the yearslong effects of a bankruptcy filing, Mary Clements Evans, the owner of the Pennsylvania-based Evans Wealth Strategies, said anyone considering the move should \"really sit down and see if there isn't any other way they can get themselves out of this financial situation.\"\n\n\"If you can borrow money,\" the certified financial planner and author said, \"they're going to lend it to you at a very high interest rate.\"\n\nEvans also stressed that when bankruptcy stems from personal financial habits rather than an unforeseen or uncontrollable event, it's important to seek help to avoid repeating the same patterns.\n\nOn TikTok, a less dire narrative around bankruptcy has emerged, with some young people portraying it as a kind of financial hack.\n\n\"I 100% believe that filing bankruptcy has been the best thing that has happened to me,\" a 29-year-old woman posting under the handle @saraphineisabellestainer said in one TikTok video.\n\nThe woman said she was $65,000 in credit card debt and that her Chapter 7 filing wiped the slate clean.\n\nThe woman said her credit score was higher than before she filed and that she's since been offered new lines of credit by card issuers.\n\nAnother user posting under the handle @victorfromhell said in a video that filing for bankruptcy \"changed the trajectory\" of his \"financial life.\"\n\n\"I had thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of debt erased in the matter of like a month and a half — it's incredible,\" the man said. He said he was able to rebuild his credit score to about 650 or 670 within several months.\n\nBusiness Insider has verified the bankruptcy cases of both TikTok users through federal court records, but has not spoken to the users to verify the rest of their stories.\n\nFlorida bankruptcy attorney Chad Van Horn told Business Insider that he's been hearing from an influx of young people exploring bankruptcy as an option.\n\n\"In their mind, it's a way for them to live a better life, and in most cases, they're absolutely correct,\" Van Horn said.\n\nVan Horn said people who emerge from bankruptcy are often targeted with credit card offers — though at high interest rates — and may qualify for a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan two years after discharge.\n\nStill, the bankruptcy process is far from simple.\n\n\"There's significant disclosure that has to be made to the court, to the creditors, to everybody, and you need to do it the right way, or you can get your discharge denied,\" said Van Horn.\n\nNot all debts can be eliminated through Chapter 7, either. Student loans, alimony, child support, and most tax debt are typically not dischargeable. And in some Chapter 7 cases, assets like a second home or a second car could be sold to repay creditors.\n\nVan Horn said the majority of his clients come to him financially \"maxed out\" and with poor credit scores.\n\nIn roughly 70% of the bankruptcy cases he has handled, especially those involving young people, Van Horn said that poor financial planning was not the cause. Instead, he said, an unexpected event pushed them into bankruptcy.\n\n\"It was something out of their hands that happened,\" said Van Horn.\n\nFor example, Van Horn recalled an 18-year-old client who let a friend drive his car, only for the friend to get into an accident. The car owner was sued for hundreds of thousands and had his license suspended after he couldn't pay the judgment, the attorney said.\n\n\"We filed bankruptcy at 18 years old,\" said Van Horn, \"and he was able to get his driver's license, save his job, and start to rebuild.\"",

    "fullText": "I've been to all 50 states and have explored everywhere from tiny towns in New England to the mountains of Alaska. Along the way, I've learned that the right travel essentials can make all the difference.\n\nAfter hundreds of flights and road trips, I've boiled my packing list down to 11 things I never leave home without. Whether it's a quick weekend getaway or a cross-country adventure, these are the items I always bring with me.\n\nAs a very frequent traveler, I do everything I can to turn airport chaos into a calmer experience, whether I'm on a packed plane or waiting in a noisy lounge or terminal.\n\nSo, I use noise-cancelling headphones to sleep, listen to music, or just tune everything else out. They've saved more trips than I can count, and I never leave home without them.\n\nNo matter where I'm going, I always bring a small first-aid kit with me.\n\nScrapes, blisters, or minor aches happen on the road, and having basics like Band-Aids and over-the-counter medications means I'm ready for anything.\n\nBetween long hikes, flights, and summer heat, it's easy to get dehydrated while traveling. That's why I always bring electrolytes with me.\n\nA quick powder package or tablet keeps me energized and feeling my best without weighing down my bag. I rarely leave home without them, as they're a small addition that makes a big difference.\n\nThis should go without saying, but hydration is a non-negotiable. That's why I always bring a refillable water bottle when traveling.\n\nI always fill mine up immediately upon entering the airport terminal (after going through security), and it makes it much easier for me to stay hydrated. Plus, it's much more cost-effective than buying airport water.\n\nI always bring cash and multiple credit cards with me when I'm on the road.\n\nCash always comes in handy for tips and hole-in-the-wall vendors that don't accept cards. However, I also pay attention to which credit cards have the best travel benefits and use them to my advantage.\n\nFor example, my American Express Platinum Card gets me into lots of airport lounges and provides a host of other benefits, including rental car theft and damage insurance.\n\nPlus, my United Airlines MileagePlus credit card helps me save on in-flight purchases.\n\nAs a woman traveling solo, I'm always thinking about my safety, so I carry a whistle with me and keep it within arm's reach.\n\nThankfully, I've never needed to use it, but knowing I can quickly draw attention to myself in any situation gives me peace of mind.\n\nAs a solo traveler, I depend on a tripod for photos. I simply place my phone on it and snap photos on a delay.\n\nThis way, I don't have to reply on other travelers — or selfies — to capture the moment.\n\nI spend a lot of time outside when I travel, so sun protection — like sunglasses and a hat — are key.\n\nIt feels obvious, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen people around me scrambling to buy these essentials because they didn't think to bring them.\n\nI love to journal on the road, so I always bring a notebook with me. I often spend nights doodling memories of the day to look back at later.\n\nIt may sound fancy, but I never travel without my large black cashmere scarf. It doubles as a blanket on flights, works well as a shawl over outfits, and adds another layer anytime I need one.\n\nIt's such a versatile item and keeps me at the perfect temperature at all times.\n\nAs a female solo traveler, I always travel with an Addalock — a small, portable device that lets me secure doors from the inside for additional peace of mind.\n\nEven if the main lock feels safe, having this on hand is a tiny addition that makes me feel more secure.",

    "description": "A Spanish fighter wing that deployed to Lithuania for NATO air policing operations arrived on base with a counter-drone system.",
    "fullText": "ŠIAULIAI AIR BASE, Lithuania — A Spanish fighter wing deployed to the Baltics for air patrol missions alongside anti-drone defenses for the first time, a reaction to growing uncrewed threats to European infrastructure.\n\nSpain's 15th Wing arrived at Šiauliai Air Base in December to begin a four-month rotation contributing to NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission, designed to protect the airspace around Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The Crow counter-drone system came with it.\n\nThe 15th Wing has deployed to the region on multiple occasions, but this is the first time that the unit has been accompanied by counter-drone technology.\n\nThe move underscores how NATO militaries are rethinking the defense of their critical infrastructure as drones increasingly become a headache for countries across Europe, flying over sensitive sites and exposing vulnerabilities.\n\nRecent drone incursions into allied airspace have pushed NATO countries to acquire and field new counter-drone systems, especially on the alliance's Eastern edge, where countries share a border with Russia. Some of the defensive technology has already been tested on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nDrones have become a growing threat in recent years, especially in combat scenarios like Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, they are rapidly becoming an issue for countries at peace; in Europe, for instance, a string of incidents over the past several months has triggered major concern across the continent.\n\nIn September, nearly 20 Russian drones penetrated Polish airspace during an attack against Ukraine, pushing NATO forces to scramble fighter jets in response and even shoot some of them down.\n\nDays later, Romania scrambled jets to escort a Russian drone out of its airspace after it crossed over during an attack on Ukraine.\n\nAnd in the months that followed, small, unidentified drones appeared across Europe, flying above or near airports, bases, military facilities, and other sensitive locations. Western officials have blamed Russia for some of the incidents. Moscow has rejected these allegations.\n\nNATO forces have reacted to the string of incursions by deploying more assets, such as fighter jets, to the Eastern flank and surging new counter-drone technology to the area as well.\n\nThe 15th Wing's arrival at Šiauliai in Lithuania with the Crow system underscored its efforts to protect military aircraft and the air base from potential threats, although its range also covers the surrounding city.\n\nCrow is a multi-layer system developed in 2019 by Spanish defense company Indra that is capable of detecting drones using radars, cameras, and sensors, and then downing them with signal interference — a type of electronic warfare — from fixed or mobile positions. The first system was delivered to Spain's military in 2022.\n\nRobertas Kaunas, Lithuania's minister of national defense, praised Spain's decision to bring the Crow system on the fighter wing's deployment, calling the move \"yet another proof of allied solidarity and shared responsibility for European security.\"\n\n\"Today, as the Baltic region is faced with relentless provocative actions from the east, each decision to enhance the airspace guard is a strategic signal,\" Kaunas told his Spanish counterpart by phone at the start of December, according to a readout of the call.\n\nLt. Col. Fernando Allen, the commander of the Spanish detachment deployed to Šiauliai, shared that NATO militaries are, indeed, facing a new challenge in drones.\n\nSince the September incidents, he told Business Insider during a visit to the air base this week, the Spanish Air Force has been focusing more on training for counter-drone operations.\n\nDrones represent a threat that is very different from the traditional crewed aircraft on which NATO air policing missions have historically focused, as they can fly at slower speeds and lower altitudes and execute more erratic movements compared to planes.\n\n\"We are making all these kinds of new procedures — new tactics — facing this kind of threat,\" Allen said. He declined to go into specifics on the changes.\n\nThe incursions have prompted discussions among NATO military leaders about how to intercept cheap drones without relying on expensive missiles fired by fighter jets. It's a dilemma that the 15th Wing — like other units across the alliance — is well aware of.\n\nMaj. Natalia Sanjuán Cortés, the 15th Wing's public affairs officer, told Business Insider that the unit is reviewing the capabilities that it needs to fight against drones.\n\n\"Because, maybe, the fighters are not the best option,\" she said. \"And we are thinking about other systems.\"",

    "fullText": "To make Garten's chicken chili for six, you'll need:\n\nWhile these are Garten's recommended measurements, I should note that I doubled some of the seasoning and added 2 teaspoons of chili powder, 2 teaspoons of ground cumin, ½ teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes, and ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper.\n\nI wanted the chicken chili to pack a punch, and doubling these spices turned up the flavor without making things too hot.\n\nI chopped my onions, diced my bell peppers, and minced my garlic.\n\nI misread Garten's recipe and diced my bell peppers a bit smaller than she recommended, but their shape still held up well in the chili.\n\nI think larger pieces might actually be too chunky for this dish because there's so much chicken in the chili, so I recommend going with a smaller dice for the bell peppers instead.\n\nI added the olive oil to my pan and threw in the onions.\n\nI cooked the garlic for an additional minute, per Garten's instructions.\n\n\"You want to cook the garlic for just a minute so it doesn't get really bitter,\" she explained in a \"Barefoot Contessa\" episode while demonstrating the recipe.\n\nI threw in the chili powder, cumin, red pepper flakes, cayenne, and salt, and cooked everything for one minute.\n\n\"I always make this with canned tomatoes; life's too short to peel a tomato,\" Garten said in the episode.\n\nAccording to the recipe, you can crush the tomatoes by hand or throw them in a food processor. If you opt for the latter, Garten recommends adding them in batches and pulsing the processor six to eight times.\n\nI don't have a food processor, so I crushed the tomatoes by hand. I also threw the leftover juice into the pot.\n\nI left my pot uncovered as my chili began to simmer.\n\nDuring the \"Barefoot Contessa\" episode, Garten said she cooks the chicken with the skin on because she found it \"really keeps it moist.\" She also noted that she roasts the chicken instead of boiling it because it makes the meat taste better.\n\nI rubbed my chicken breasts with olive oil and generously sprinkled salt and pepper on each one. I then threw them in the oven and set the timer to 35 minutes, per Garten's instructions.\n\nI love making chili and believe it always tastes better the longer it is left on the stove, so I was happy to wait a little longer.\n\nBut Garten's recipe is designed so the chicken and chili are ready at the same time, so you can always finish this more quickly, depending on how soon you need dinner.\n\nGarten said the chicken breasts should be \"just cooked\" when you take them out of the oven.\n\nGarten's recipe calls for the chili to simmer with the chicken for 20 minutes. I wanted to maximize the flavor, so I let it simmer for 45 minutes.\n\nSince I bought pre-grated cheese, all I needed to do was chop my green onions.\n\nGarten's chicken chili is so hearty and comforting. The rich tomatoes paired really well with the tender and juicy chicken, which soaked up so much delicious flavor, and the bell peppers added great texture.\n\nThe green onions on top also helped brighten each sip and added some nice crunch. And I recommend pairing this with sour cream for that extra hit of acidity and creaminess.\n\nI made this chili for my friend Kayla, who was also a huge fan.\n\n\"This chili is reminiscent of a chicken tortilla soup, but it's so much heartier!\" she added. \"It makes you feel so warm and cozy.\"\n\nAs temperatures continue to drop, Garten's recipe will definitely satisfy your chili cravings.",

    "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs gutted its workforce. Lawmakers say veterans are now paying the price.",
    "fullText": "A scathing report released this week by Democratic congressional staff sharply criticized the Department of Veterans Affairs, accusing the agency of dramatically reducing its healthcare capacity after slashing tens of thousands of jobs in the past fiscal year.\n\nThe report, issued by Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Democrats, argues that the sweeping overhaul of the VA has weakened its ability to deliver care.\n\nThe VA lost more than 40,000 employees in fiscal year 2025, marking the department's first net workforce decline in years, the report said; early planned cuts targeted over 80,000 jobs. Nearly 90% of those losses, it continued, came from healthcare roles, including physicians, nurses, mental health providers, and appointment schedulers.\n\nDemocratic staffers attribute the workforce hemorrhage to last year's dramatic DOGE-driven cuts — a federal hiring freeze, firings of probationary employees, deferred resignation and early retirement programs, and new staffing caps that limited the department's ability to backfill vacancies. The report maintains that those changes accelerated departures among clinicians and support staff.\n\n\"In a typical year, VA's workforce gains a net of at least 10,000 employees. Under the first year of Trump, Collins, and Musk, the workforce has experienced a net loss three times that number,\" the report said, referring to Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins and the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk.\n\nVeterans' trust in the VA exceeded 80% in 2024, according to the report, a marked increase over the preceding decade. More veterans than ever have begun using VA healthcare for their needs, the report added. The system had managed to decrease wait times after years of criticism from veterans — in 2016, some veterans were waiting over 100 days to see a medical provider. That same year, veterans' reported trust in the VA was just 25%.\n\nThe report includes internal data showing net losses among medical providers and administrators, and insight from veterans.\n\n\"Appointments are often canceled or rebooked with little to no notice,\" one Maryland veteran said. Others warned that an already strained civilian health system, particularly for mental health care, cannot easily absorb displaced veterans as the US continues to grapple with a shortage of mental health providers in many areas.\n\n\"We desperately need more investment in the VA,\" another veteran said. \"Too many people depend on it here.\" In 2024, the VA oversaw over 127.5 million health care appointments and saw the highest number of female veterans enrolling for care.\n\nCuts have had tangible effects on care delivery, the report said. Wait times for new mental health appointments currently average 35 days, and in many states over 40 days, more than double the VA's threshold. The report also cites facility closures, canceled therapy programs, and new limits on one-on-one mental health sessions tied to staffing shortages.\n\nMental health care has been particularly affected, the report says. At one VA outpatient clinic in California, seven of twelve mental health providers left the department, citing return-to-office mandates, resulting in wait times for new patients at that facility reaching more than 120 days.\n\nBeyond staffing, the report says nearly 16,000 VA contracts were either canceled or allowed to expire, affecting services ranging from radiology and disability exams to suicide prevention programs. The VA overstated the financial savings from those cancellations, the report says, and has failed to provide Congress with a full accounting of the affected contracts.\n\n\"Due to the Trump hiring freeze, essential researchers whose terms were ending were shown the door and forced to abandon lifesaving work, and their positions were unable to be backfilled,\" the report said. \"These actions directly damaged veterans' access to cutting-edge treatments and clinical trials, including cancer trials.\"\n\nVA leadership has previously said staffing and contract changes are intended to improve efficiency and accountability and has disputed claims that care has been harmed. The report counters those assertions and argues that the changes reflect a shift away from capacity-building at a moment when veteran demand remains high.\n\nWhen asked by Business Insider for comment on the report's findings, VA spokesman Peter Kasperowicz called it \"political theater\" and pointed to 16 VA press releases detailing improvement for veterans under President Donald Trump. Those improvements, Kasperowicz said, include opening new clinics, a decrease in benefit backlogs, terminating employee union contracts, and ending DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives.",

    "description": "A winter snowstorm is bringing snow, ice, and potentially record-breaking temperatures across multiple states this weekend.",
    "fullText": "Despite record-breaking temperature drops across the US over the last century, the world continues to get hotter. In fact, only three states have recorded their lowest-ever temperatures in the 21st century.\n\nIt doesn't mean, however, that the US hasn't experienced some excruciatingly low temperatures in recent years. This weekend, a winter storm is expected to barrel across the South, the Plains, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, dumping snow, sleet, and ice, and potentially setting record low temperatures into next week.\n\nThe coldest temperature ever recorded in the US was -80 degrees in Alaska in 1971. And since records began, all but one of the 50 states has reported a temperature below zero. What's the holdout? Hawaii, which recorded its lowest temperature of 12 degrees Fahrenheit at the Mauna Kea Observatory on May 17, 1979.\n\nAccording to data compiled by NOAA's State Climate Extremes Committee, the coldest temperatures ever recorded in each state are listed below.\n\nMelissa Wells contributed to a prior version of this story.\n\nOn this snowy January day, it was Lucille Hereford, the postmaster and town volunteer weather observer, who recorded the -27-degree temperature, calling it a \"terribly cold\" morning in a 1988 interview with an Alabama State climatologist.\n\nPer a 2021 news report by WHNT, a local news outlet, the official story comes with a caveat: The temperature was initially erroneously recorded as warmer than the -24 degrees Fahrenheit reported at Russellville the same day. It wasn't until years later that a Birmingham reporter uncovered the truth, and the National Climatic Data Center finally issued a correction in its records.\n\nThe Anchorage Daily News reported in 2013 that there have been unofficial measurements of even lower temperatures. On the National Weather Service Alaska website, Phil Schaefer said it hit -84 degrees Fahrenheit in Coldfoot in 1989, and Joe Cochran said the temperature in Hughes dropped to -85 degrees Fahrenheit in the '90s, The Daily News reported.\n\nHowever, the Prospect Creek Camp temperature is the only one that's been verified.\n\nThis is the lowest temperature ever recorded in the US.\n\nHawley Lake isn't a town so much as a remote weather station, but it's important in Arizona's meteorological history. In addition to setting a state record for 91 inches of snow in 1968, the overseer of Hawley Lake, Stan Bryte, recorded the state's lowest temperature of -40 degrees Fahrenheit in 1971, per AZCentral.\n\nIn fact, on the morning of January 7, 1971, Bryte's chief meteorologist told him, \"You need to get up to Hawley Lake. I have a suspicion this is going to be a real record.\"\n\nBrook Farm Pond is near the town of Gravette, which has just over 3,500 residents, according to census data.\n\nIt is located in Benton County, which has the motto \"The Heart of Hometown America.\" At one time, it also bore the name of \"Gate Community\" for serving as a gateway to northwest Arkansas from Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported in 1937 that the low temperatures had brought \"influenza, frozen toes, broken water pipes and automobile radiators, icy streets and traffic disruption.\"\n\nCBS News reported in January 2023 that Maybell, located 25 miles west of Craig, is home to just 76 people.\n\nMaybell resident of 56 years Georgia McIntyre told 9News in 2015, \"You don't think about how cold it is. You just put all the clothes you've got on, and we even put newspapers in our shoes because we didn't have all these fancy things you have now.\"\n\nIn 1943, a National Weather Service observer noted February was a \"relatively mild month\" in Connecticut, only for the state to record its coldest temperature in the state's history 16 days into the month, per a 2023 CT Insider article.\n\nA freezing day in January just 18 years later would hit that same low temperature.\n\nThirty-seven years later, a Millsboro weather station recorded a temperature of 110 degrees Fahrenheit on a scorching July day, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWTXL Tallahassee reported in 2020 that in Tallahassee 124 years ago, an inch of snow coated the city (its third biggest snowfall ever), and a record low of -2 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded.\n\nHeadlines at the time read \"All Previous Records Broken,\" and editors were calling the storm, \"The Snow King,\" \"The Ice King,\" and \"the Great Blizzard of 1899,\" Tallahassee Democrat reported in 2018.\n\nNot even 12 years later, on July 24, 1952, Georgia recorded its highest temperature at 112 degrees Fahrenheit in Louisville and again on August 20, 1983, in Greenville, according to NOAA's State Climate Extremes Committee.\n\nForecasters think this record may have changed because, on February 11, 2019, several sensors at the Mauna Kea Observatory reported temperatures between 8 and 11 degrees Fahrenheit, Khon2 reported in 2022, but it has yet to be confirmed.\n\nIsland Park Dam is located in the Targhee National Forest in the northeast corner of the state. It's tied for the eighth coldest temperature ever recorded in the US.\n\nFrigid temperatures across Illinois in late January 2019 led to a startling discovery: On the morning of January 31, the weather observer at Mount Carroll in Carroll County recorded a temperature drop to -38 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nOnly after an extensive review did the State Climate Extremes Committee collectively validate the reading as the new state record low temperature, The State Journal-Register reported in 2019.\n\nABC57 reported in 2020 that all temperatures across Indiana dropped below zero on the morning of January 19, 1994.\n\nIn a newscast from 1994 for WRTV Indianapolis, a mail carrier told former Channel 6 meteorologist David James, \"Well, I'll tell you, it's better today than it was yesterday, 'cuz there's not that wind. So, I don't mind this at all.\"\n\nIowa was one of many states in the Midwest that experienced the \"1996 Cold Wave,\" as KCRG-TV9 described it in 2016.\n\nThe winter of 1905 was reportedly so bitterly cold that \"it was impossible for one to face the storm,\" according to \"Reno County Kansas, Its People, Industries, and Institutions,\" by B.F. Bowen & Co. Inc. of Indianapolis, published in 1917 and reported in 2014 by The Kansas City Star.\n\nAccording to meteorologist John Belski, January 19, 1994, \"was certainly a day for the history books.\"\n\n\"Those who were not around in 1994, it was the only time I can remember when grocery stores in parts of Louisville ran out of food and gas stations ran out of gas that week since no deliveries were able to be made for several days. It was so strange to see people walking in the middle of Bardstown Road and also Broadway,\" he recalled for WLKY News in 2020.\n\nOver two weeks in February 1899, freezing weather swept over the US, with record-low minimum temperatures recorded in 12 states. According to weather historian David Ludlum in \"The Great Arctic Outbreak and East Coast Blizzard of February 1899,\" this was \"the greatest arctic outbreak in history\" at the time.\n\nAfter a month of scrutinizing weather data, scientists said in February 2009 that Maine had reached a record low: 50 below freezing.\n\nAfter much evaluation by the State Climate Extreme Committee, \"It turned out [the -50 reading] was spot on,\" Bob Lent, Maine director of the US Geological Survey, said, as reported by NBC News in 2009.\n\nOakland, Maryland, is home to 1,851 people, according to census data. It was established in 1849 and became a well-known tourist spot when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad built a rail line that traveled through the town, according to Britannica.\n\nThe same temperature was previously recorded in Coldbrook on February 15, 1943, and in Taunton on January 5, 1904.\n\nOnly 11 states have recorded colder temperatures than Michigan: Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nThe average low in this sparsely populated former mining town is usually around 4 degrees Fahrenheit in February, according to WorldClimate.com.\n\nInterestingly enough, the coldest and hottest temperatures recorded in Missouri have both been in Warsaw, according to the University of Missouri Climate Center. The hottest temperature was a whopping 118 degrees Fahrenheit on July 14, 1954.\n\n\"It's a day that will probably live in American history forever,\" Corby Dickerson, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said of the record, NBC Montana reported in February 2023. \"It was the coldest day ever observed in the lower 48 states.\"\n\nThe biggest snowstorm on the southeast US coast was known as the \"Christmas Snowstorm of 1989,\" according to The National Weather Service, and it was felt all the way to Nebraska. It broke snowfall records in several states, and unheard-of temperatures followed.\n\nFifty-seven years after the state's cold temperature, a weather station in Laughlin recorded a temperature of 125 degrees Fahrenheit in June, per data from NOAA's State Climate Extremes Committee.\n\nMore recently, sensors on Mount Washington logged the US' coldest windchill on record: -108. The Weather Service office serving Mount Washington posted in February 2023 that its recording software refused to log the reported low number.\n\n\"That was a very cold morning in northeastern New Jersey,\" David Robinson, a New Jersey State Climatologist, told NJ.com in 2019.\n\n\"A deep fresh snow cover, the valley location, adjacent to a pond that was used to make ice, and a generally treeless landscape near the station all helped contribute to the excessive cold.\"\n\nConversely, the hottest temperature in New Mexico was recorded on June 27, 1994, at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Loving, where it reached a blazing 122 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nJane Tormey, the official weather watcher for Old Forge for CNY Central, recalled in 2013, \"People were saying their milk froze on the way home from the store to home. A lot of cars obviously couldn't get started. My car window driver's side was shattered.\"\n\nOne of the past century's most extreme arctic outbreaks occurred between January 18 and January 22, 1985. According to the National Weather Service, newspapers at the time reported at least 165 deaths related to the weather.\n\nCoincidentally, both the hottest and coldest temperatures recorded in North Dakota's history happened in the same year, with Steele hitting 121 degrees Fahrenheit on July 6, 1936, KYFR-TV reported in 2023.\n\nOhio was another state affected by the unprecedented cold of February 1899. The US Weather Bureau reported 105 fatalities between January 29 and February 13 from the arctic temperatures and avalanches brought on by \"the Great Arctic Outbreak.\"\n\n2011 was reportedly Oklahoma's third snowiest year, and the state's record for most snowfall in 24 hours was reached in Spavinaw, with 27 inches, FOX23 News reported in 2020.\n\nUkiah and Seneca are occasionally known as \"Oregon's Icebox\" due to their icy winter conditions. That said, Meacham residents have said the temperature once plummeted to -62 degrees Fahrenheit, but it has never been proven officially, The Oregonian wrote in 2010.\n\nPhoenixville is five hours from Smethport, where the coldest temperature was recorded 32 years prior.\n\nAccording to NOAA's State Climate Extremes Committee, -25 degrees Fahrenheit was previously reported at Greene, Rhode Island, on February 5, 1996, but it could not be verified.\n\nMcIntosh was home to just 111 people in 2020. It is the county seat of Corson County.\n\nThe two days of 113 degrees Fahrenheit were recorded in Perryville on July 29, 1930, and August 9, 1930, making them the hottest temperatures ever recorded in Tennessee.\n\nTexas is known for its heat, but even this state has seen severe drops in temperatures — the best known was during the Great Blizzard of 1899.\n\nSome unofficial reports even claim temperatures reached -30 degrees Fahrenheit in February 1899 at Wolf Creek, Texas. Either way, the Concho Valley Homepage reported in 2022 that newspapers in 1899 described the temperatures as \"the worst freeze ever known in the state.\"\n\nBloomfield, a town in Essex County, had a population of 217 in the 2020 US census. The weather station existed from 1906 to 1968, according to Century 21 Farm & Forest.\n\nCentered in the Allegheny Mountains is Mountain Lake, one of only two freshwater lakes in Virginia, according to the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources.\n\nJust a year after this temperature was recorded in 1985, Mountain Lake was made famous again for \"Dirty Dancing,\" which is where the movie was filmed.\n\nOn June 29, 2021, Hanford, Washington, reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the hottest recorded temperature in that state.\n\nJust 13 years later, the highest temperature recorded was 112 degrees Fahrenheit in Moorefield, West Virginia, on August 4, 1930.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded in Wisconsin ranks ninth in the nation.\n\nAlthough Yellowstone's temperatures in Wyoming haven't plummeted to the levels they once did in 1933, \"since most of the park lies at an elevation of 6,000 feet above sea level or higher, unpredictability characterizes Yellowstone's weather,\" the National Park Service has said.\n\nCorrection: January 9, 2024 — An earlier version of this story included an image that was mislabeled as Minden, Louisiana.

    "description": "D1 college football was my entire life, so when it ended, I completely lost myself and gained weight. I turned to boxing to lose 120 pounds.",
    "fullText": "When my D1 college football career ended, I didn't just lose the game. I lost my identity.\n\nFootball had structured my entire life: my schedule, my body, my purpose. When that structure disappeared, I didn't know who I was anymore. I had been living what I now recognize as a lukewarm lifestyle, doing just enough to get by, but not anchored in anything solid. Without football, there was nothing left to lean on.\n\nI let my life deteriorate, and it took a lot to get back on track.\n\nGrief and uncertainty compounded quickly. I withdrew from people. I stopped training. I stopped caring for my body. I gained weight rapidly and avoided mirrors. By the time I finally confronted reality, I weighed around 300 pounds.\n\nAt my lowest point, I was living at home and working at FedEx, making roughly $400 a week. There is nothing wrong with honest work, but for me, it symbolized how far I had fallen from the man I once believed I was called to be.\n\nI wasn't just overweight. I felt directionless, embarrassed, and spiritually empty.\n\nOne night, exhausted and overwhelmed, I prayed honestly for the first time in a long time. I didn't ask for success or shortcuts. I asked for strength, clarity, and the courage to face myself. That prayer didn't change everything overnight, but it changed the direction of my life.\n\nWhat followed wasn't motivation. It was obedience, discomfort, and discipline.\n\nI knew I had to get uncomfortable if I wanted a different life. Comfort had nearly destroyed me, so I started showing up early, doing things that scared me, and putting myself in environments that demanded confidence before I felt ready. Faith gave me the foundation, but discipline gave me the reps.\n\nI didn't grow up thinking of myself as violent. I didn't believe I was capable of real aggression or dominance. Stepping into a boxing gym changed everything. You can't hide in the ring. Fear, insecurity, and doubt show up immediately. Training humbled me. It also rebuilt me.\n\nSlowly, the weight came off. Over nine months, I lost 120 pounds. The first six months were the most dramatic, nearly 85 pounds, but the physical change was only part of it. I was rebuilding confidence, identity, and belief in myself one disciplined day at a time.\n\nWhen I entered the Houston Golden Gloves tournament, I wasn't chasing a title. I was testing who I had become. Standing in the ring, I realized I wasn't becoming someone new. I was finally operating as the man I always believed I was capable of being. Discipline had uncovered confidence. Faith had restored identity.\n\nThat same approach reshaped the rest of my life.\n\nI transitioned into a new professional path, working remotely. I finally had a financial turnaround. It was the compound effect of disciplined habits applied everywhere.\n\nLosing Clay and losing football forced me to confront a hard truth: Life doesn't pause to let you grieve neatly. Loss comes in waves. Without structure and faith, it can pull you under.\n\nWhat I've learned is that rebuilding doesn't start with motivation. It starts with obedience. Discipline creates stability. Faith gives it meaning.",

    "description": "Tesla removed its Autopilot basic self-driving software as a standard feature in the US on new Model Y and Model 3 purchases as the company pushes its more advanced FSD (full-self driving) subscriptions.",
    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) removed its Autopilot basic self-driving software as a standard feature in the US on new Model Y and Model 3 purchases as the company pushes its more advanced FSD (full self-driving) subscriptions.\n\nPer Tesla’s website, new orders for Tesla’s entry-level models no longer offer Autopilot as a standard option, now only offering a Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, essentially an adaptive cruise control that allows the vehicle to change speeds when following another car on the highway.\n\nPreviously, Autopilot offered Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and auto-steer, which allowed the car to stay centered in its lane and change lanes using the turn signals.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Tesla removed Autopilot as it faced a suspension of its dealer license in California stemming from a ruling that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing over claims about Autopilot and FSD. The ruling was stayed for 60 days to allow Tesla time to comply, namely to change marketing practices around the software.\n\nThe change comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week the company would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for FSD, pushing instead to a monthly subscription offering of $99 per month, which was already an option.\n\nMusk said late Thursday night the price of FSD could rise as well.\n\n“I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve,” he said on X.com. “The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”\n\nPulling Autopilot from Tesla EVs is a notable move considering other automakers, including Toyota, offer such services as standard options in their vehicles. On the flip side, the move to focus on FSD may be the right one considering Autopilot was an older technology and, per Musk dictates, FSD was Tesla's autonomous future.\n\nInterestingly, one X.com user posited Tesla’s move to pull Autopilot was tied to Musk’s new compensation plan, one that required a milestone of 10 million paying FSD subscribers.\n\nYesterday, Tesla stock popped when Musk announced the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"",

It includes the aftermath of a car crash, followed by a fist fight that escalated to a shooting that struck a person and a fire truck. \n• Video Above: How to report a public safety threat\n\nAt around 5:33 p.m. on Thursday, SCSO responded to the area near Fulton Avenue and Hurley Way for a report of a car crash that had escalated into a physical fight. While deputies were responding, they received reports that someone was shooting into a crowd.\n\nBeloved social media couple Kristy and Desmond Scott announce divorce\n\nOfficers said that three suspects, Avieon Spencer, 25, Antwon Pace, 35, and a 14-year-old juvenile, had been driving erratically through a parking lot before crashing their vehicle, causing it to overturn onto its side. After the crash, Pace was injured while Spencer and the juvenile exited the vehicle.\n\nAccording to SCSO, the suspects became upset after noticing bystanders recording the incident. Video footage shows a male who seemingly assaulted another male victim and robbed him of his phone. The identity of the assailant is unclear. A female victim was also assaulted, but the perpetrator was unsuccessful in taking her phone.\n\nRoseville police recover massive $7,000 American flag stolen from Camping World\n\nWhen officers attempted to detain Spencer, officers said a fight broke out. During that confrontation, the juvenile retrieved a firearm and began shooting, which was caught on video.\n\nOne victim was struck by gunfire but sustained non-life-threatening injuries. A responding Sacramento Metro Fire engine was also struck. SCSO said fire personnel were forced to flee on foot, but were not injured. Spencer and the juvenile reportedly fled the scene in different directions.\n\nThe juvenile was caught quickly, according to SCSO. He was booked into Sacramento County Juvenile Hall for alleged assault with a deadly weapon and assault on a firefighter with a firearm.\n\nSheriff’s K9 units tracked Spencer from the scene and found him hiding in a nearby residential neighborhood, where he was arrested. After a medical evaluation, deputies said he was booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail for alleged robbery and delaying a public officer. His bail is set at $50,000, and he is scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 26.\n\nThe third suspect, Pace, was taken to a hospital for critical injuries related to the crash. SCSO said he will be arrested for outstanding warrants after he is medically cleared.\n\nClick or tap here to see the video footage.",

The restaurants are located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina and Wyoming. The decision comes after Hardee’s Restaurants reportedly sued ARC Burger claiming that the franchisee failed to keep up with payments.\n\nARC Burger reportedly made the decision to shuttering the locations in response to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that the franchisee started missing payments in December 2024. Hardee’s claimed the payments included franchise royalties, technology and training fees, rent and taxes and advertising contributions.\n\n“These closures are a result of ARC Burger’s failure to cure its defaults under its franchise agreements, despite solid sales and our continued attempts over the course of many months to reach a resolution that would keep these restaurants open,” Hardee’s said in a statement to USA Today.\n\nHardee’s was reportedly suing ARC Burger for $6.5 million it said were owed as part of its franchise agreements.\n\nThe locations were all set to close by the end of 2025, but there is some hope for loyal Hardee’s fans.

I knew it was going to be a hard move for our nuclear family unit, but I was convinced LA was the right place for us to be.\n\nI didn't fully understand the impact it would have on me.\n\nIt was my dad whom I immediately felt I had lost.\n\nBefore we moved, my dad was everything to me. He and my mom had split when I was young, so my dad had full custody. It was just the two of us all the time.\n\nWhen I had my daughter, my dad moved in with us and was there to help with all the practical aspects of raising a child. But he was also just there as emotional support for me. He made me complete.\n\nAfter we moved, we only saw him once a month, when he'd take the train to visit us. I missed him and felt overwhelmed without him.\n\nIn August 2025, I was grieving the loss of two family members, feeling overwhelmed with sadness, but also with life in general. I remember sitting on my bed, losing it, crying.\n\nMy daughter was knocking on the door, asking me when we were leaving the house — we were going out for the day. I snapped at her. I couldn't leave the bed. I wanted to show up for her in that moment, but couldn't.\n\nIn that moment, I felt like a failure compared to my dad. He had lived through so much grief and so many hard times, and yet I never knew because he managed to hold everything together.\n\nAll I could think to do was to call my dad, crying as he answered. He listened to me and then told me he would call me right back.\n\n\"Everything is going to be OK,\" he said before hanging up. Dad has never been a \"words\" person.\n\nNot too long after, he called back and told me he had been to the train station to buy a train ticket to come visit the next day.\n\nKnowing he was coming felt like a double-edged sword. I felt incredibly lucky to have a dad who would come and see me at the drop of a hat, but I also felt self-doubt because my elderly dad could get it together, but I couldn't.\n\nThe next morning, when I knew my dad was on the train, bound for my house, I was certain everything would be OK. My dad was coming. With him, life feels normal and complete.\n\nI don't regret the wonderful changes the move afforded me and the position in life it put my nuclear family and me in. But had I known not seeing my dad every day would wreck me as it has, I don't know if I would have done it the same way.\n\nI had bought into the modern idea that decisions should always be made with the nuclear family in mind, but the distance from him made me realize how much I emotionally value my dad in ways I didn't think imaginable.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would never advise my daughter to move away from her village, even if it means she'll move closer to a partner's village, as I did. I think as a mother, I did her a disservice by moving her away from my family, her tight-knit community.",

    "description": "Parents think passing down their homes for their children to inherit is the ultimate reward. In this economy, it might not be.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katarina Polonska, a relationship scientist and coach who will be inheriting her childhood home in Slovakia. Vancouver-based Polonska, 36, said the home needs a lot of work, and it may not be worth managing renovations from abroad. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm going to be inheriting my childhood home where I was born. I love it, and it's very precious to me. But I don't have any right to it yet.\n\nIt's mostly used as a family holiday home, but ultimately when my mother passes, it's going to be given to me.\n\nMy mother owns it, and there's no plan to sell it — the value of the home isn't very high, in fairness. It's a two-bedroom, one-bathroom. It's not worth much at all; maybe $80,000 CAD. I don't think the money would go very far in Canada.\n\nAlso, selling it would require a lot of renovations. It's very old school and needs a lot of TLC, and my mother doesn't live in Slovakia, she lives in England. So from her perspective, she's thinking, \"Why would I invest 30,000 or 50,000 euros (about $35,245 or $58,742) in a property that I go to a few times a year max? What's the point?\"\n\nShe also knows it would to be really complicated to sell it from abroad, having to navigate viewings and trusting realtors and all of this stuff.\n\nThe reality is, I'm going to own this foreign property when she passes.\n\nMy husband is also waiting to inherit. His mother inherited a property in Barbados from her parents, though she never lived in Barbados.\n\nHis mother had to wait to take over the Barbados property, and by the time she took it over, it had declined a little bit and there are always complications with it.\n\nI've actually never seen it myself, but I know that there's a lot of work to be done with the house. But his mother has been holding onto it saying, \"You can inherit it and you and Kat can enjoy it.\"\n\nBut he's like, \"We don't go to Barbados enough.\" It's just more hassle having to manage and protect a property when you're not physically in the country.\n\nI think from my perspective, because I'm naive about it, I'm like, keep it, it'd be really nice to have it. But his argument is that the place isn't in the area of Barbados that I would necessarily want to go to.\n\nHe's really wary. He doesn't want to be managing the property and he would rather sell it and then distribute the money within his family.\n\nSo we both know that there's going to be this new responsibility on our heads and, candidly, I think life is difficult enough as it is.\n\nI'm not going to rent the Slovakia home out because it's from, like, the 1980s. It's not been renovated. It's ancient; the wallpaper's faded.\n\nWhile Slovakia is kind of an up-and-coming country from a tourism perspective, I don't think anyone would want to stay in this place as an Airbnb unless it was literally advertised as a historical relic: \"Come stay in this ancient old-school apartment!\"\n\nMy husband and I have talked about how we're probably going to have to renovate it. We know that at some point, we're probably going to have to take a couple of months to be there physically to renovate it. But when is that going to happen? We both work, and getting to Slovakia is like a 20-hour journey from here.\n\nI think, more realistically, we could just keep the place and treat it as a little getaway to escape to. There is really lovely nature nearby and I don't have any other properties, so there is merit psychologically to knowing that there is a place that's home, even if it is halfway across the world.\n\nWhen it comes to inheriting property, I think there needs to be more dialogue between the parent and the child of, \"What do you actually want to do?\"\n\nI think a lot of parents have this assumption that leaving a kid the property is the ultimate goal; we've made it, we've paid off the mortgage, we have this home, and now the kid gets it. Those days are kind of gone.\n\nWe don't live in a world where everyone grows up and lives in the same town or city as their parents. We live in a really global economy. People are moving, people are more transient, and the world has become smaller. It's also become a lot more expensive, and home ownership isn't what it used to be.\n\nParents need to recognize that the world we're in is very different, and Millennials are not an anxious generation for no reason. We have a lot of stresses. It makes more sense to have a dialogue with your kid around what they want.\n\nI wish parents would ask, \"What do you want? Where are you at with your life, and what kind of inheritance makes sense?\"\n\nIs it, in fact, a lump sum of cash, because maybe you're a busy entrepreneur and you don't have time to sell? Maybe you actually would prefer the parent to sell, which is annoying for the parents, but maybe the kid would prefer that.\n\nThank you for the inheritance — that's very generous. But I think quite a lot of kids would probably say it's not worth it. Either enjoy the money, mom and dad, or cash out, downsize, and just give us a down payment or something.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose 100% tariffs on all Canadian goods and products exported to the US should Ottawa make a trade deal with China.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whom he called \"Governor Carney,\" against making a \"drop off\" deal with Beijing or face the levies.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,\" he added.\n\nCarney made an official visit to China last week — the first by a Canadian leader since 2017 — meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss economic and trade opportunities between the two countries.\n\nIn a joint statement following the meeting, Ottawa and Beijing said they had committed to expanding bilateral trade and investment, as well as building cooperation in areas such as energy and agriculture.\n\nCarney also announced that Canada would now allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market on the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In return, he said Canada expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by March 1.\n\nTrump had initially said that the deal was what Carney \"should be doing\" and that it was \"a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.\"\n\nTrump's changing tone comes days after Carney delivered an impassioned speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he opined on the changing face of global politics since Trump's election.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney, who did not explicitly name Trump, said, adding that \"middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.\"\n\nTrump did not miss the opportunity to snap back at Carney during his own speech at Davos, saying the prime minister \"wasn't so grateful.\"\n\n\"Canada lives because of the United States.

    "description": "Jerry Clark says he's transformed his tastebuds, changed his portion sizes, and made fitness a non-negotiable.",
    "fullText": "When Jerry Clark decided to quit the Army, hit the road, and start driving long-haul truck routes 34 years ago, he had no idea what a dramatic impact the career change would have on his body.\n\n\"A truck driver is the worst job in the world for health,\" Clark told Business Insider.\n\nArguably, no one is required to sit more on the job than a truck driver. And we all know sitting is the new smoking.\n\nClark spent years tag-teaming across the country with his wife on trucker routes. At one point, before she retired, they were logging 8,000 miles together every workweek. The pair would drive almost three full lengths across the continent each week, eating whatever they could find to sustain them along the way.\n\n\"We eat at the greasy spoons,\" Clark said, explaining the average truck driver's meal plan. \"Everything is grease, or fried.\"\n\nAll that sitting and eating greasy food can lead to long-term health issues and body imbalances. Clark developed a stronger left leg from operating his clutch and a stronger right arm from being at the wheel for half of the day. He also gained over 50 pounds over the course of three decades.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, when he heard his employer was offering free nutrition coaching for people with diabetes through Virta Health, he wondered if he might be eligible to join the low-carb program, even though he has normal blood sugar and doesn't need to \"reverse type 2 diabetes,\" as the company promises. Sure enough, his employer allowed him to try it out.\n\nClark has lost over 75 pounds in the program and has discovered he has renewed energy for both work and hobbies, including wood carving. He says he's trimmer now than he was when he left the Army in his mid-20s. He's spent the past several months maintaining his weight and working on muscle building.\n\n\"I look pretty dang-on good right now for a 58-year-old guy,\" he said. \"Almost getting a six pack back.\"\n\nHe has also helped his son lose over 100 pounds using the nutrition techniques he's learned, which are in line with some of the recent federal nutrition guidelines, released in January.\n\nThis is no coincidence: Virta co-founder Jeff Volek helped draft the Trump Administration's new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourage people to skip ultra-processed foods and added sugar, prioritizing animal protein and \"healthy\" fats.\n\nNow Clark eats more whole foods than he used to, including fruits, vegetables, and meat. He doesn't fuss too much about fat, especially the kind of fats in nuts, fish, and lean proteins like chicken.\n\n\"My journey's not over, but I am getting there,\" he said.\n\nMany nutrition experts say low-carb ketogenic diet plans like the one he's following are not right for everyone. Generally speaking, people without diabetes could benefit from more fiber and whole grains than this style of eating typically provides. Still, there are a few nutrition basics that just about every \"healthy\" diet plan agrees upon. Virta's low-carb strategy is no exception. Plants like fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds are good. Extra sugar and empty calories from white bread, cakes, and sodas? Not so much.\n\n\"There's this base of knowledge which is pretty translatable between different diet camps,\" nutrition scientist and ultra-processed food researcher Kevin Hall, co-author of the book \"Food Intelligence,\" previously told Business Insider. \"All of the camps can sort of agree on non-starchy vegetables and lowering added sugar.\"\n\nHall has performed studies showing that low-carb diets are not any better than low-fat diets, when it comes to how much fat people lose. Low-carb diets can be helpful for stabilizing blood sugar in patients with diabetes, but it's the quality of a person's diet that matters most.\n\n\"For the vast majority of people, it's really the processed and refined carbohydrates that they should avoid,\" Hall said. Carb-forward beans and strawberries, loaded with fiber and antioxidants, are great choices for most people.\n\nAnother big reason for the success of Virta patients like Clark, according to former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. David Kessler, is the \"built-in accountability\" that patients get from Virta's intensive, personalized coaching model, as he explains in his new book \"Diet, Drugs, and Dopamine: the New Science of Achieving a Healthy Weight.\"\n\nAs for Clark, he has a few evidence-based nutrition moves he credits with helping him make the lasting diet changes that he plans to stick to for the long haul.\n\nWhen Clark drives his 600-mile route from North Carolina to West Virginia and back overnight, he brings his own \"lunch,\" or gets a few essentials from the supermarket. No more greasy spoons. Broccoli, leafy lettuces, and cucumbers are now staple foods at his house for lunch and dinner.\n\n\"I'll pack a chicken breast and some broccoli, and then at around midnight when I get to a truck stop, I'll pull in and pop it in a microwave, and I'm pretty happy,\" he said.\n\nWith the help of his nutrition coach, Clark started meal prepping and shopping around the perimeter of the grocery store, a classic pro-nutrition move.\n\n\"Most of the crap is in the middle,\" he said.\n\nClark has found that over time, he is craving less sugar. It helps that he doesn't keep junk food in the house, since it's typically loaded with sugar, saturated fat, and refined flour. Now, he finds he wants veggies and other whole foods, including deer and rabbit for dinner, and blueberries as a sweet treat.\n\n\"Food itself tastes good as long as you change your taste buds,\" he said. \"It's going to take you a month for your taste buds to change.\"\n\nStudies suggest that most of our taste buds regenerate about every 10 days, but some take longer to turn over, around three weeks or so.\n\nClark said he still enjoys many of the same foods he used to eat, he just prepares them differently now.\n\n\"You can have the same stuff,\" he said. \"You can't have all the added crap that America puts on it.\"\n\nFor him, that means rotisserie chicken instead of fried chicken and homemade ice cream made from whipping cream and eggs, with far less sugar than store-bought tubs.\n\nThough the Clark house generally stays away from fast food and ultra-processed groceries now, there is some occasional wiggle room from time to time for a low-calorie, low-carb, ultra-processed dessert like Cool Whip with Jell-O. Even that's pretty rare these days, Clark said.\n\nClark says one of his biggest challenges in the program has been learning not to overeat. It's something he's talked over with his coach.\n\n\"I am an over eater — that's my biggest problem,\" he said. \"I like mass quantities of food.\"\n\nObesity medicine doctors say that's likely because Clark's \"enough\" point became dysregulated: as he gained weight, his brain sent signals to his body to eat more and store more fat, in protection mode against starvation.\n\nWith guidance tailored to his body size and a kitchen scale, Clark started measuring out a recommended 7 ounces of protein for lunch and dinner. But his coach also gave him a quick shortcut for thinking about his portion sizes.\n\n\"Your hand is your best tool,\" he said. \"The palm of your hand without your fingers is approximately 7 ounces, that's a portion of meat.\"\n\nWhen Clark started adding regular weightlifting into his workout routine, the number on his bathroom scale stagnated. His coach encouraged him to focus on other metrics instead.\n\n\"My muscles are getting bigger, and my waist is getting smaller,\" he said. \"My coach said, 'If you're happy with what you see in the mirror, be happy.'\"\n\nClark has been openly sharing his nutrition strategy with family and friends. His son has lost over 100 pounds using his techniques, and one of his long-haul trucking buddies has lost over 80 pounds.\n\n\"We talk every night: 'Hey man, what'd you eat today? Did you work out?'\" Clark said. It's another time-tested strategy: couples, friends, and families who lose weight together tend to have better long-term success.\n\nNow, Clark's wife is getting interested in the program.\n\n\"She sees me, and she's like, 'Man, you're doing really good. I want to try that.'\"\n\nFinally, Clark has developed a new routine of working out 6 days a week, alternating heart-healthy cardio (like a run) with weightlifting every other day. Building muscle mass is a great way to maintain the right kind of weight loss, encouraging the body to shed fat instead of muscle. If he's hungry after, he grabs a protein shake \"to fill my muscle stores up.\"\n\n\"I told my wife: one hour a day, I don't want anybody to bother me,\" Clark said. \"No phone calls, no 'honey, you got to fix the toilet, mow the grass.'\"\n\nNow, he looks forward to the dedicated, sacred time for workouts.\n\n\"An hour out of a day? Come on. That's nothing. Give it to yourself and then make it work,\" he said.",

(NASDAQ:PLUG) was one of the best performers on Thursday.\n\nPlug Power snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday, jumping 16.67 percent to close at $2.59 apiece, as investors loaded portfolios ahead a special shareholders’ meeting next week.\n\nIn a notice to its investors, Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) said that it would hold a special meeting at 10 AM on Thursday, January 29, to vote on two company proposals, including increasing its authorized capital stock to 3 billion from 1.5 billion at present.\n\nPlug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) said the capital stock increase was necessary to meet its financial obligations, maintain operating flexibility, and continue executing its business plan.\n\nShould shareholders reject the said initiative, Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) said that it would implement a reverse stock split in order to create sufficient share availability to meet its financial obligations and maintain business flexibility.\n\nIt would also seek approval of the shareholders to modernize voting standards by aligning the company’s charter with current Delaware corporate law. If approved, such an amendment would allow certain future charter amendments to be approved by a majority of votes cast, where permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL).\n\n“This change ensures that outcomes are determined by the stockholders who actively participate in the voting process, rather than by shares that are not voted at all. Under the Company’s current charter, shares that are not voted effectively have the same impact as votes cast against a proposal, which can prevent proposals from passing even when a clear majority of voting stockholders support them,” it said.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of PLUG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

He didn't run off to buy yachts or sports cars. Instead, he wanted to take business and finance courses, manage his newfound wealth responsibly, and eventually give back through charitable work. What he didn't plan for? His parents demanding a full quarter of the winnings—roughly $3.75 million—because, in their words, \"we raised you.\"\n\nThe Reddit post made clear this wasn't a close-knit family cashing in on shared joy. The man described his upbringing as \"distant white middle class,\" saying he had moved an hour away from his \"oppressive mother and distant father.\" While he described his sisters as \"nice people,\" he noted they don't have a real relationship.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nDespite this, when he won the lottery, he offered to pay off his parents' mortgages and provide them a cash gift. But when they learned the full scope of his winnings, that wasn't enough. \"Once they found the total amount,\" he wrote, \"they expected a quarter of it.\"\n\nThe conversation escalated. When his mother said, \"we raised you,\" he couldn't help but remember the five-year stretch—from age 15 to 20—when his parents completely cut off contact. Though he didn't directly confront them with that memory, he now questions whether he owes them anything at all.\n\nMany Redditors agreed that his parents were being unreasonable, entitled, and opportunistic. One user summed it up sharply: \"You don't owe them s**t.\"\n\nAnother commenter laid out a detailed legal and financial checklist: hire a lawyer and financial adviser, draw up a will and living trust, create powers of attorney for medical and financial decisions, and install a home security system. They ended their comment with a blunt mantra: \"People get crazy with money.\"\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd they weren't alone in that warning. Multiple users emphasized the need for protection—not just from scammers or strangers, but from family members who might be willing to sue, manipulate, or guilt-trip to access the prize. One even suggested freezing the winnings in a trust for a year just to let emotions cool and see how people behave.\n\nStill, not everyone was entirely unsympathetic to the family's reaction. From a devil's advocate angle, some might say parents who supported their child for nearly two decades—through diapers, meals, and housing—might feel hurt or excluded if they're only offered a slice instead of a share.\n\nBut that perspective hinges on a relationship that doesn't seem to exist in this case. The man's post didn't reveal abuse or violence, but the emotional neglect—especially during his formative years—cast a long shadow. Five years of silence from his parents left a mark. And now, with millions on the table, old wounds are reopening under the glare of entitlement.\n\n\"I feel like I've been as generous as I can be,\" he said, noting he never explicitly said so to his parents, but assumed it would be clear. What stung most was that their reaction didn't reflect pride or joy—it reeked of resentment that they didn't get more.\n\nSee Also: Private-Market Real Estate Without the Crowdfunding Risk—Direct Access to Institutional-Grade Deals Managed by a $12B+ Real Estate Firm\n\nThe original poster has since emailed his parents to reiterate his offer and state firmly that nothing more would be coming. Whether they respond, and how, remains to be seen.\n\nIn a later update, he stressed that this situation wasn't about seeking revenge or proving a point. It was about maintaining boundaries and protecting the life he's worked hard to rebuild. \"I am not looking to be told how to spend my money or how to be vindictive,\" he wrote. \"They do love me, even if it's in their own sad way.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's the hardest part. Winning the lottery can change your bank account—but it doesn't fix broken relationships. The man walked away with $15 million, but in doing so, he discovered that family ties can fray under the weight of expectation. And in his case, no amount of money seems likely to stitch them back together.\n\nRead Next: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "description": "U.S.",
    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump filed a $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and its CEO Jamie Dimon on Thursday for closing his accounts allegedly for political reasons.\n\nHere is a look at Trump's claims and how the case could play out:\n\nThe largest U.S. bank closed accounts of several Trump businesses in ​April 2021 after they had been customers for decades, according to Trump's lawsuit. JPMorgan notified Trump of the closures about a month after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol ‌building on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump said the bank's motivation was political and that JPMorgan violated Florida law barring unfair trade practices and acted in bad faith.\n\nTrump also accused Dimon of ordering a malicious \"blacklist\" to warn other banks about doing business with the ‌Trump Organization, Trump family members and Trump himself. Trump said the publication of this blacklist amounted to trade libel under Florida law and said his businesses suffered considerable financial and reputational harm as a result.\n\nThe suit comes after Dimon criticized Trump's immigration policies and proposal to cap interest rates that banks charge on credit cards.\n\nJPMorgan denied wrongdoing, said the lawsuit had no merit and that it closes accounts that create legal or regulatory risk for the company.\n\nWHAT WILL TRUMP HAVE TO SHOW TO PREVAIL?\n\nThe case will likely boil down to whether Trump's legal team can prove the bank canceled the accounts because of his political viewpoints. Terms of banking ⁠agreements tend to strongly favor the banks, which do not need ‌to provide a reason for closing an account and customers often don't know why their accounts are terminated.\n\nIn this case, Trump said JPMorgan gave a 60-day notice of the account closure but did not provide a reason.\n\nBanks must monitor their customers for a variety of potential risks, and a customer who had an account ‍closed because of banned activity such as money laundering would have no grounds to challenge it.\n\nHowever, some reasons for terminating an account might be considered an unfair trade practice or bad faith, including closing an account due to a customer's religion or ethnicity.\n\nLegal experts said canceling an account because of an accountholder's political viewpoint, which JPMorgan said it does not do, would likely be impermissible.\n\nHowever, it might be legal if an accountholder's views were so extreme ​they undermined trust in the bank. Trump could argue that his political views were mainstream as he had just amassed more than 70 million votes in losing the November 2020 election.",

    "fullText": "Shannon Gerdauskas thought she was going in for a routine oil change. Instead, the DeLand, Florida resident was left with a repair bill of nearly $20,000.\n\nGerdauskas took her Mercedes to a Take 5 Oil Change location in October, expecting to be in and out quickly. Instead, she says a technician mistakenly drained her transmission fluid rather than her engine oil and let her drive away.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThe trouble started within minutes.\n\n“It was shifting by itself. So, it was like trying to go into reverse and neutral as I’m driving down the road,” she told WFTV’s Action 9 Consumer Investigator (1).\n\nGerdauskas immediately took the car back to the shop, where workers acknowledged the error.\n\nBut what followed was a familiar and often pricey consumer dispute: Who’s responsible when routine maintenance goes wrong?\n\nAccording to Gerdauskas, her dealership later determined the vehicle had been driven with no transmission fluid, which can cause serious internal damage to the car. The estimated cost to replace the transmission and complete all the related work totaled more than $18,000.\n\nTake 5 told Action 9 that it paid for a transmission flush but closed the claim after the dealership said the transmission did not need to be replaced.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerdauskas said she was told the transmission would eventually fail.\n\n“My transmission was not damaged before it entered their shop,” she said, “Just pay for the damage you did.”\n\nIn a statement, the company said that while cases like Gerdauskas’ are rare, they “strive to resolve matters fairly and transparently”. But her case isn’t as unique as it seems.\n\nAction 9 found similar complaints nationwide involving Take 5.\n\nWFTV’s sister station in Charlotte, North Carolina, spoke with Ben Brown in 2025 after a visit to Take 5. He said he pulled over, opened the oil reservoir and smoke was coming out. His car ultimately needed a new engine.\n\nIn Georgia, Robin Porterfield reported a similar experience. She said technicians drained her oil but never refilled it before sending her on her way.",

    "fullText": "Second one-day international, R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo\n\nSri Lanka 219 (49.3 overs): Asalanka 45 (64); Root 2-13, Overton 2-21\n\nEngland 223-5 (46.2 overs): Root 75 (90), Brook 42 (75); De Silva 2-37\n\nEngland won by five wickets; Series level at 1-1\n\nJoe Root made a measured 75 as England pulled off a comfortable run chase to beat Sri Lanka by five wickets in the second one-day international to square the three-match series.\n\nSri Lanka posted a relatively modest 219 after England's spinners had turned the screw on a surface which offered appreciable turn.\n\nCharith Asalanka top-scored for Sri Lanka, striking just one boundary in his 64-ball 45, while Dhananjaya de Silva chipped in with 40 on a day where strike-rates were largely an afterthought.\n\nVeteran leg-spinner Adil Rashid bowled the most impressively for England as he finished with economical figures of 2-34 from his 10 overs while Root's two overs at the end yielded 2-13.\n\nRoot's patience at the crease, deft footwork and reading of spin made him the linchpin of England's chase and once he settled in, Sri Lanka found it difficult to know where to bowl to him.\n\nEngland's all-time leading Test run-scorer shared stands of 68 with Ben Duckett, who made 39, and 81 with fellow Yorkshireman Harry Brook which broke the back of the reply.\n\nRoot's innings had been chanceless until a yorker from Asitha Fernando hit him on the pad as he attempted to flick the ball off his toes.\n\nHe reviewed the decision to give him out lbw, but the ball-tracking technology came down in Sri Lanka's favour and he was out on umpire's call.\n\nThat left Brook and Jos Buttler to get the 42 runs required and nerves probably jangled when the England skipper misjudged a sweep on 42 and was lbw to Jeffrey Vandersay.\n\nBut Buttler (33* off 21 balls) put his foot on the accelerator to get England over the line with 22 balls to spare to wrap up their first win in 12 ODIs away from home.\n\nBrook criticises 'worst ever' pitch after ODI win\n\nEngland level ODI series against Sri Lanka - as it happened\n\nWith opener Zak Crawley absent with a knee injury, England experimented with Rehan Ahmed at the top of the order.\n\nIt was not without precedent in domestic cricket. In his sole T20 innings in the role he made 49 runs off 32 balls, while his first-class record is reasonable. In four innings, he has 203 runs at an average of 67.7 with one century and one half-century.\n\nAhmed looked relatively composed in Colombo but whether 13 off 18 balls has done enough to persuade England coach Brendon McCullum it is an experiment worth persisting with remains to be seen.\n\nDuckett still looked like a man trying to find his way back into form during an unconvincing innings off 52 balls.\n\nBut it was Root, like that favoured old pair of slippers or warm winter jumper, who provided the reassuring comfort in England's middle order as he crafted a peerless knock.\n\nThere were some fluent strokes to the boundary for four but he eschewed the flamboyant during a more a familiar tale of accumulation - just as it has been for most of his career.\n\nOver the course of this innings, Root went past 3,500 runs in singles in ODI cricket. His non-boundary strike-rate of 59.95 is actually the best for any batter in ODI history.\n\nOn this metric, Root sits above two ODI greats in AB de Villiers (59.23) and Virat Kohli (58.10).\n\nThose low-risk dabs and flicks, nudges and nurdles, were valuable to England on a pitch which required a batter to play the percentages.\n\nRoot once again shows no signs of stopping. Appreciate him while he's doing his thing.\n\nMost of the spin from England during the Ashes came via their off-the-field briefings as they attempted to massage the narrative of a winter tour of discontent.\n\nOn a pitch which ragged at the R Premadasa Stadium, however, it was the degrees of turn offered by the ball which provided the focus on this occasion.\n\nIn ODIs since the start of 2024, this stadium has seen an average turn of 2.93 degrees. In the 23 bowling innings here in this timeframe, England's degree of turn today was the fourth-most at this venue.\n\nEngland managed 3.15 degrees of spin in the first ODI but it was 3.62 here - a 15% increase - which Brook, to his credit, astutely realised was the best way to winkle wickets.\n\nThere were 40.3 overs bowled by spinners which was the most by any England bowling attack in an ODI. The previous record was 36 overs, back in March 1985 in a 50-over match against Pakistan in Sharjah.\n\nIt was also the first time in an ODI England have used six different spinners.\n\nRashid's leg-breaks were the most masterful as he finished with an economy of 3.40 claiming the key top-order wickets of Sri Lanka opener Pathum Nissanka and captain Asalanka.\n\nBut he was well supported by a phalanx of twirlers - offies from Will Jacks and Root, leggies from Ahmed plus Jacob Bethell's left-arm orthodox.\n\nFive different spinners picked up a wicket - the joint-most in an ODI innings by a team and first by England.\n\nThe seven wickets which fell to spin was the second most by an England attack in an ODI, bettered only by eight against West Indies at North Sound in 2014.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

The City fans were already celebrating.\n\nAfter watching several replays, however, Hallam surprised nearly everyone inside the stadium by choosing to stick with his original decision.\n\n\"After review, the ball hits the arm of the Wolves player, which is in a natural position so the on-field decision will remain,\" he announced over the tannoy.\n\nFormer Premier League assistant referee Darren Cann said it was \"without doubt the correct decision\".\n\n\"Hallam, officiating in his first Premier League match, made an excellent and courageous call to stick with his on-field decision of no handball,\" Cann told BBC Sport.\n\n\"This was without doubt the correct decision as Yerson Mosquera's arm was in a justifiable position and the ball was played on to his arm from very close range.\n\n\"A brave and correct decision in law from a highly regarded referee making his Premier League debut.\"",

    "fullText": "Another reckless swipe of the racquet could have led to a horrible sense of deja vu for Novak Djokovic.\n\nBack in 2020, Djokovic was disqualified from the US Open after accidentally hitting a line judge in the neck with a ball.\n\nDuring his straight-set Australian Open win over Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp on Saturday - his 400th Grand Slam victory - Djokovic smacked another ball away from the court and risked a further ignominious default.\n\nThe 38-year-old was fortunate the fizzing forehand narrowly missed a ball girl who ducked out of the way as she crouched at the net post.\n\n\"I apologised for that. That was not necessary and in the heat of the moment. I was lucky there and I'm sorry for causing any distress to the ball kid or anybody,\" said Djokovic.\n\nHe was lucky. Another attempt at a record 25th major title could have been aborted by his own carelessness.\n\nThe ball girl's quick reactions may have saved Djokovic. If she had been hit, tournament referee Wayne McKewen would have had serious grounds on which to default the 24-time major champion.\n\nWhile these were different circumstances to the US Open incident, the Grand Slam rulebook tells us why McKewen could have come to that conclusion.\n\n\"For the purposes of this rule, abuse of balls is defined as... hitting a ball dangerously or recklessly within the court or hitting a ball with negligent disregard of the consequences,\" it says.\n\n\"The referee in consultation with the Grand Slam supervisor may declare a default for either a single violation of this code or pursuant to the point penalty schedule.\"",

    "fullText": "Rory McIlroy and Tyrrell Hatton played together during the first two rounds of this week’s Dubai Desert Classic.\n\nHatton enters the weekend at five under par, four shots off the pace, while McIlroy trails him by three strokes.\n\nBefore play got underway, the world number two said to the Briton that if he wanted to feature in next year’s Ryder Cup, he would need to sort out his fines with the DP World Tour.\n\nThe comment was a nod to Hatton’s issues with the DP World Tour following his move to LIV Golf.\n\nWhile it would have been easy to assume their conversations focused on Hatton’s Ryder Cup hopes, that was not actually what they discussed most often.\n\nMcIlroy and the 34-year-old have a strong friendship and a good understanding of each other.\n\nBut this week in Dubai, Hatton shared something about himself that caught the five-time major winner off guard.\n\nWhile speaking to The Times, Hatton discussed his weight gain during the offseason.\n\nHe revealed: “He (McIlroy) was horrified to hear what weight I was on January 1.\n\n“I was 204 pounds which, at 5ft 8in, is aggressive. Before the Ryder Cup I was like 190, so that’s another stone I’d put on. I enjoyed my December.\n\n“I did some training but zero cardio and a lot of drinking. I had a Guinness tap in the house which was enjoyable, so now is the time to lose some weight.”\n\nHatton is not shy about enjoying his downtime, and there is no harm in that.\n\nAfter months on the road and the constant demands of top-level golf, it’s natural to unwind a bit. Even McIlroy takes some time to switch off, though he might not go quite as far as Hatton does.\n\nThe season ahead is important for Hatton, especially with expectations building around his performance in the majors.\n\nIf he can stay in contention regularly, there is every chance he could finally make that breakthrough.\n\nDespite putting on some weight over Christmas, it would not be wise to bet against him bouncing back strongly. His ability has never been in question – it is just a matter of pulling everything together at the right time.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold can make USC history. Other Trojans will play huge roles as they all try to make the Super Bowl",
    "fullText": "We are one week closer to the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. This weekend will determine which two teams will make it to the Super Bowl. In both games, the former USC Trojans will play a huge factor and have their fingerprints all over games with the Super Bowl up for grabs. Sam Darnold not only has his legacy on the line, but also a chance to represent his alma mater for the first time on the NFL's biggest stage.\n\nHere are my predictions for championship weekend in the NFL:\n\nSam Darnold and the Seahawks will enter the biggest game in recent memory for the former NFC juggernaut. This time around, they enter with a defense similar to the Legion of Boom but an offense that is more well-rounded. Seattle has looked miles ahead of the other playoff teams left. I think the Rams will give them a challenge and this game will come down to the last drive, but Seattle has proven themselves to be the better team between the two teams in this matchup. They can blowout teams, they can win close, low-score games, and they can win shootouts. I think this game, Sam Darnold, and the Seahawks offense will have to be at its best, but I think Darnold will deliver the best quarterback performance in this matchup. Seattle will move on and represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.\n\nMany might gift wrap this win to the Patriots with Bo Nix being out for the rest of the season, but I disagree. I think the Patriots come out on top, but they will have to work for this game. The Broncos' defense will need former USC Trojan Talanoa Hufanga to fly around and make plays all day. The Patriots' offense has struggled to keep Drake Maye upright in each of their playoff games. Maye has been sacked 5 times. That is where the Broncos' defense specializes. Their defensive line can get after their quarterback like no other. The Broncos' defense will keep them in this game; it will come down to whether or not he can put together his best Nick Foles impression. I think he will play well, but not well enough to win this football game. I think he will come up short late and throw a costly interception, and Drake Maye and Mike Vrabel will iron out this victory in a low-scoring defensive battle.\n\nI think Sam Darnold saves his biggest performance for the game right before the Super Bowl. Darnold squeaked by Stafford and the Rams in the last meeting between the two teams in an overtime win. Darnold will have to play exactly like he did down the stretch in that game to get the victory in this one. I think Darnold reaches 300 yards through the air, and he and Jaxon Smith-Njigba light up the Rams' secondary. This secondary has given up their fair share of big games to their opponent. This game will be no different. Jaxon Smith-Njigba will have over 100 yards receiving, and he will connect with Sam Darnold for two touchdowns in this game. I think Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba have the two biggest performances in the NFC Championship game.\n\nIn the AFC, I think pass rusher Nik Bonitto has the most dominant performance. The Patriots have given up 5 sacks in each of their playoff games. In the last game versus the Texans, Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. combined for 5 sacks. Bonitto this season had 14 sacks. I think he will have 3 sacks in this game and disrupt Drake Maye all game long.\n\nI think defensive tackle Milton Williams will also have himself a big game and disrupt the Broncos on the other end. Williams has been a huge reason for the Patriots' defensive turnaround, and he was great all regular season long. He creates pressure from the interior with the best of them, and he is a great run stopper. I think he will lead this Patriots defensive line to make the Broncos one-dimensional and take out their run game. Williams will also lead the Patriots in sacks with two. Verus the Chargers, Williams had two sacks, and against the Texans, he was an irritant all game long, forcing the pick 6 that took the momentum away from Houston initially. I think Milton Williams will use all of that to have his best playoff game with the Patriots and help send his team to the Super Bowl.\n\nMy Super Bowl matchup prediction is the New England Patriots taking on the Seattle Seahawks. The Patriots have had quite the Super Bowl run vs tough defenses, but they still will not be prepared for the Seahawks' defense. Mike Macdonald and the Seahawks defense will make it a tough day for young star quarterback Drake Maye. I think his age and inexperience will come back to bite him in this match. I think Rashid Shaheed will pay homage to Devin Hester and take the opening kickoff back for a touchdown, setting the tone for the entire game. I think Darnold will not have to do much to be the top quarterback on the field, but he still will put up a respectable performance. Seattle will play their last complete performance of the season, getting their Super Bowl victory. Darnold will look to be greedy and not just settle for being the first Trojan quarterback to start in the Super Bowl, but he will also become the first Trojan quarterback to win a Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Predictions for USC on championship weekend in NFL playoffs",

    "fullText": "Freiburg enjoyed an impressive 2024-25 campaign that ended with a fifth-place finish and Europa League qualification, but Julian Schuster’s side face an uphill task to repeat that feat this season. With 16 games remaining, Die Breisgauer are currently eight points adrift of the European places.\n\nLast weekend’s 2-2 draw away at Augsburg summed up their recent frustrations. Freiburg had already been beaten 2-0 by RB Leipzig the week before, and the fact that relegation-threatened Augsburg raced into a two-goal lead made the dropped points all the more disappointing.\n\nAs a result, Schuster’s men remain eighth in the Bundesliga table and were unable to capitalise on defeats for Bayer Leverkusen and RB Leipzig on matchday 18.\n\nThough some confidence was restored on Thursday evening, with Freiburg's 1-0 win over Maccabi Tel Aviv all but securing an automatic berth in the Europa League round of 16 - a competition in which the hosts have fared excellently this term.\n\nFreiburg have few injury concerns, although centre-back Philipp Lienhart remains sidelined with an abdominal injury and is still several weeks away from a return. In his absence, Max Rosenfelder will likely start alongside Matthias Ginter.\n\nDaniel-Kofi Kyereh has returned to training after a lengthy layoff but is unlikely to be ready for selection, having not featured competitively since February 2023.\n\nPredicted lineup - 4-2-3-1: Atubolu - Kübler, Ginter, Rosenfelder, Günter - Eggestein, Manzambi - Treu, Suzuki, Grifo - Höler\n\nKöln travel to Freiburg buoyed by finally ending a prolonged winless run in the Bundesliga.\n\nLukas Kwasniok’s side came from behind to beat Mainz 2-1 last weekend, securing their first league victory since November, and ending an eight-match run without a win.\n\nThat result lifted the Billy Goats up to 10th in the table with 20 points, giving the promoted side some breathing room, with a seven-point gap to the relegation zone.\n\nWhile Köln began their return to the top flight with back-to-back victories, including a 4-1 win over Freiburg in August, consistency has proved elusive, with just two wins in their following 13 Bundesliga matches.\n\nKöln head into Sunday’s clash as underdogs, but there are signs of improvement away from home. They have avoided defeat in two of their last three matches on the road, although they have still lost three of their last five away fixtures.\n\nA win on Sunday would move Köln within one point of Freiburg, while defeat could drag them back towards danger, with Werder Bremen only two points behind in 14th.\n\nKöln remain deep into a defensive injury crisis, with Luca Kilian and Timo Hübers both sidelined with season-ending knee injuries, while Dominique Heintz, Jahmai Simpson-Pusey and Joel Schmied are dealing with medium-term problems.\n\nSebastian Sebulonsen, Rav van den Berg and Cenk Özkacar are expected to form a three-man defence, with Heintz and Simpson-Pusey targeting returns in early February.\n\nPredicted lineup - 4-3-3: Schwäbe - Castro-Montes, Sebulonsen, Berg, Lund - Kaminsku, Martel, Krauß - Maina, Ache, Bülter",

    "fullText": "Liverpool head to the Vitality Stadium this weekend with momentum firmly on their side and a familiar dilemma facing Arne Slot, rotate or reward the players who delivered so emphatically in midweek. A 3-0 Champions League win away in Marseille showcased the squad depth Slot has built since winning the Premier League in his first season, but the short turnaround leaves room for subtle adjustments.\n\nThe headline, as ever, is Mohamed Salah. Fresh from his return from the Africa Cup of Nations, the forward wasted little time making an impact in France and now looks set to start again on the south coast.\n\n“Knowing Mo, he is ready to play,” said Slot on Friday. “Because he has shown that so many times in his career.”\n\nThat certainty gives Liverpool a familiar attacking edge, even as Slot weighs up whether to stick or twist with his wider selection.\n\nSalah’s presence instantly raises Liverpool’s ceiling and Bournemouth are well aware of the threat. With Florian Wirtz drifting between the lines and Hugo Ekitike offering a mobile focal point, Liverpool’s front four looks increasingly fluid. Add Dominik Szoboszlai’s ability to carry the ball at pace and the visitors arrive with plenty of firepower.\n\nFederico Chiesa remains the main fitness concern. The winger missed the Marseille game and Slot admitted he remains a “50/50” call.\n\nSlot said: “For the rest, no-one picked up a knock after the game. I expect all the same players to be available again.”\n\nThat leaves the manager with genuine choice rather than enforced compromise, a luxury Liverpool have not always enjoyed in recent seasons.\n\nAt the back, Liverpool will again be without Ibrahima Konate following a family bereavement. Slot has handled the situation with sensitivity and made it clear the player will not be rushed.\n\n“I spoke to [Konate] a few times,” said Slot. “I think these are private matters and they should stay between us.\n\n“It’s very obvious that if something like that happens, a player needs time to be there for his family and also time for himself.”\n\nJoe Gomez is expected to partner Virgil van Dijk at centre-back, with Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez providing pace and width from full-back. There is also uncertainty around Andy Robertson, who may miss out amid ongoing transfer discussions with Tottenham.\n\nCurtis Jones is pushing for a return in midfield, potentially slotting in alongside Ryan Gravenberch and Szoboszlai. That trio offers a blend of control, athleticism and creativity, which could be key against a Bournemouth side likely to press aggressively at home.\n\nSlot’s system relies heavily on positional discipline in midfield and Jones has often thrived in those roles, particularly in away fixtures where game management becomes crucial.\n\nAlisson; Frimpong, Gomez, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Jones; Salah, Szoboszlai, Wirtz; Ekitike\n\nKick-off is at 5.30pm on Saturday, January 24, 2026, with live coverage on Sky Sports.\n\nFor Bournemouth, this represents a stern test against champions who are growing more confident each week. For Liverpool, it is another opportunity to underline their title credentials and maintain pressure at the top of the table. Slot’s challenge is not finding quality, but deciding which version of it he wants to unleash.",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times give their thoughts on the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the Rams, the LeBron James-Jeanie Buss rift and college football.",
    "fullText": "The fury over the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker makes me wonder who's shouting the loudest?\n\nCould it be desperate, unfortunate fans whose beloved teams are owned by inheritors, nepo families, or private equity bros who celebrate their glamorous assets?\n\nSo how about a new metric in the sports page to accompany the ranking of teams and players: ownership. Not simply by wealth, but wisdom, brains and commitment. And for fun let's call it the McCourt-Moreno Index.\n\nIt's time we hold the Marge Schotts of pro sports accountable for the franchises they mismanage.\n\nThere are some alarming implications to Bill Plaschke's \"If it blows up baseball, so be it.\" Perhaps he means that MLB should be reduced to a burning garbage heap with three teams atop — Yankees, Cubs and Dodgers — because they were the only ones who went into the TV business and peddled their services for billions in the three largest TV markets.\n\nMaybe he yearns to transform MLB into the NHL of my childhood, with six teams. That was OK if you lived in a shallow arc extending between New York and Chicago — not so good for everyone else.\n\n\"So be it,\" as Plaschke would say, but I can guarantee I won't be the only one who isn't watching anymore.\n\nNaturally Dodger fans are all excited about the signing of the $60-million-a-year All-Star right fielder, Kyle Tucker. But we're not going to be happy when Dodger Stadium becomes the first MLB ballpark with a two-drink minimum.\n\nAs everyone seems to be raving about the Dodgers' acquisition of Kyle Tucker, I note the following: There is another player who was recently signed by the Yankees for less money and less signing bonus than Tucker who had higher numbers last year in average, home runs and WAR. He also plays more positions. Hadn’t the Dodgers heard of Cody Bellinger? Bellinger as a Yankee will never feel right to me.\n\nAsk a Major League Baseball owner like Arte Moreno, who sells out his ballpark whenever the Dodgers come to Anaheim, and sees Angel broadcast ratings surge whenever his team plays the Dodgers, if he thinks the Dodgers are ruining the game.\n\nThe Rams won the battle of which team gets to lose to Seattle.\n\nThe NFL needs to clarify exactly what does and doesn’t constitute pass interference. There is no consistency as to how it's called with each official seeming to have their own definition of what constitutes pass interference. It has gotten to the point where it’s worse than major league umpires and their own definition of the strike zone. NFL, you need to clean this up because these are major calls that are ruining games.\n\nBill Plaschke finally wrote a column about the Lakers with which I agree. LeBron James is the past, Austin Reaves is the future, and $50 million will help the Lakers rebuild. Yes, it's really as simple as that.\n\nWith the Lakers defense costing them multiple games, reminiscent of the coach Mike (no D)'Antoni days, the only real interesting Laker news last week were the alleged Jeanie Buss comments about the King. They sounded like they were lines taken from a scene in \"The Godfather\" .... \"What have I done to make you treat me so disrespectfully.\" My opinion is that it \"was not personal and strictly business.\"\n\nWhen asked after each game how he'd celebrate another victory, Indiana's Curt Cignetti would say, \"With a beer.\" After guiding his team to an undefeated season, and then winning the national championship, I doubt the Hoosiers' coach will ever have to buy another beer again.\n\nLincoln Riley is officially on the clock. In two years Curt Cignetti took a woebegone college team, with nary a five-star player, to an undefeated national championship. Cignetti has proven that, even in the NIL era, coaching matters. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick …\n\nCurt Cignetti and Indiana football playing in and winning the national championship was a modern-day version of the movie \"Hoosiers\" and would have made coach Norman Dale (actor Gene Hackman) proud. Now the question is, can new UCLA football coach Bob Chesney and his 40-plus transfers be the second coming of Indiana? Only time will tell.\n\nKings president Luc Robitaille appears to be happy with the Kings' status quo that appears to be getting one point every game in an overtime or shootout loss.

    "title": "Cowboys news: What Christian Parker brings as the new defensive coordinator",
    "description": "Here's the latest news surrounding the Dallas Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what Cowboys fans can look forward to in Christian Parker’s defense.\n\nWhat can be expected in Dallas?\n\nAs previously mentioned, Parker becoming the defensive coordinator for the Cowboys is the first time in his career – at any level – that he’s been a defensive coordinator. So, it’s yet to be seen what an entire defensive scheme would look like under Parker. He’ll be able to build a defense in his image for the first time, but will likely pull from the mentors he’s had in the past, like Vic Fangio.\n\nThe most likely aspect that’ll come over for Parker from a schematic standpoint is the two-high safety look. It’s a versatile approach that doesn’t tip the secondary’s plan pre-snap and forces the QB to make post-snap reads as defenders can rotate into all sorts of different coverage looks after the snap in both man and zone.\n\nFrom a coverage standpoint, their most utilized coverage was Cover 3 over the two years Parker coached the Eagles (32.1% on average). Next was Cover 1 (22.2%) and Cover 6 (21%), with Cover 4 (16.5%) rounding out the four most-utilized coverage packages that Philadelphia used. Their zone/man coverage splits sat around 70/30% respectively,\n\nNow that the Cowboys have their coach, the next important piece of the puzzle is the personnel. Dallas is high on CB Shavon Revel, who they selected with their third-round pick in 2025. Injuries held him back for most of the season, however, but a fresh start with Parker and full offseason and training camp for the first time at the NFL level could be massive in his development. There’s also former All-Pro CB DaRon Bland, who will also be looking to get healthy after undergoing surgery on his foot and is aiming to return to his 2023 form.\n\nDallas also has two first-round picks in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft. The front office has made clear that they’ll evaluate all options on both sides of the ball when they’re on the clock, but given Parker’s background with early-round draft picks, a secondary player being one – if not both – of the selections would make sense. There’s also the free agency market that the Cowboys can work with, as Parker has gotten plenty out of veteran players in his past too.\n\nFinally, the other question ahead of Parker and the Cowboys is what his defensive coaching staff will look like. While Parker’s history is with the secondary, he’ll have much more responsibility now as the coordinator. Who does he trust to coach those positions when he’s elsewhere?\n\nSimilarly, the front seven is a crucial part of the defense as well. Part of what made the defenses Parker was a part of in Denver and Philadelphia great as a whole was their front units too, which complimented the secondary and allowed the entire group to have success. The coaching hires there, as well as personnel moves that will be made in the offseason, are going to be an important aspect to monitor ahead of Parker’s first year calling an NFL defense.\n\nWhat Christian Parker needs to do in order to turnaround the worst defense in Cowboys history.\n\nFRISCO — Congratulations, Christian Parker. You’re officially the new defensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys. You should be excited. Being a first-time defensive coordinator at 34 is a huge compliment and a signal that your fast-rising career has the potential to go even further.\n\nBut there’s no question about it: the road ahead in Dallas is not easy.\n\nParker is inheriting the worst defense in franchise history and one of the worst the league has seen in the last handful of years. Change, from a player standpoint, is inevitable — whether it’s because players are free agents or because there’s a clear need for upgrades.\n\nParker is now leading that change. Here are three ways he could have success doing so.\n\nCowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer gathered his assistants for a meeting when he told them that Matt Eberflus, after one season, wouldn’t be returning as the team’s defensive coordinator. He told the assistants that he’s been in Eberflus’ shoes before. He then told the assistants he has been in theirs, as well, and if they had any questions they could ask him.\n\nThe defensive assistants on staff, including multiple that came with Eberflus from Chicago, would seemingly have an obvious question for Schottenheimer: Will they still have a job when the new defensive coordinator is chosen?\n\nParker can now help answer that.\n\nIn all likelihood, there won’t be many returnees from this most recent staff. That’s usually what happens when a new coordinator comes to town. Considering how poorly Dallas played last year and how aligned multiple assistants have been with Eberflus, it makes a lot of retention even less likely. For perspective: half of Dallas’ defensive assistants were with Eberflus in Chicago before coming to the Cowboys.\n\nOne interesting assistant is Cowboys defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton. There’s been a familiar question posed within the Cowboys organization, stemming from players and coaches and front office members alike. People have wondered how impactful Quinnen Williams, Kenny Clark and Osa Odighizuwa could be if they had a full offseason to work together. Keeping Whitecotton could help in that continuity.\n\nWhitecotton, serving as the defensive coordinator for the East Team at the Shrine Bowl in Frisco, has interest elsewhere, however. The Tennessee Titians reportedly requested to interview Whitecotton for their open defensive coordinator job. Whitecotton worked with new Titans head coach Robert Saleh when they were with the New York Jets.\n\nOne of the essential parts of a coordinator interview is a plan for a staff. Parker surely presented the Cowboys that plan. Who will it include?\n\nThe Cowboys may be looking for a new defensive line coach soon.\n\nThe Thursday hiring of Christian Parker as defensive coordinator in no way means the Cowboys‘ 2026 coaching staff is locked. Parker may have changes he wants to make to build his own defensive staff, and current assistants may yet explore new options or draw interest from other clubs also undergoing offseason turnover.\n\nCount Aaron Whitecotton among that latter group. The Cowboys defensive line coach has been requested for an interview with the Tennessee Titans for their current defensive coordinator position, per a report Friday from ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler.\n\nThe Titans announced Robert Saleh as their new head coach earlier this week, prompting many observers to expect a call to Whitecotton, given the long history shared by the two.\n\nWhitecotton and Saleh first overlapped from 2014 to 2016 as assistants in Jacksonville. Then in 2020, for what proved to be his final year as 49ers head coach, Saleh brought Whitecotton to San Francisco as assistant D-line coach. In 2021, Saleh moved to the Jets head coaching job, and he once again brought Whitecotton with him, this time making him his defensive line coach.\n\nDallas needs to invest in the cornerback room to maximize the talents of Christian Parker as defensive coordinator.\n\nStep 1: Hire a new defensive coordinator. Check.\n\nThat was always going to be how the Dallas Cowboys’ path toward rebuilding their historically bad defense from the 2025 NFL season. With the team agreeing to terms with Christian Parker to be their next DC, that’s out of the way. But there’s a lot more left to be done.\n\nThe Cowboys defense lacks talent in every defensive position except defensive tackle and this offseason will require the front office to get busy. Edge rushers, linebackers, and safeties are needed. But when you look at Parker’s resume, it’s clear what the obvious step the team needs to take really is: They need to prioritize getting him a cornerback.\n\nParker, formerly the Philadelphia Eagles pass game coordinator and defensive backs for the Denver Broncos before that, is somewhat of an All-Pro factory when it comes to corners. At Philly, he majorly contributed to Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell earning All-Pro honors in their second year in the league. Years earlier, he did the same with Patrick Surtain II in Denver.\n\nNow granted, though Parker deserves plenty of credit with his success developing three All-Pro corners like that, Surtain II and Mitchell were first-round picks and Mitchell was considered a steal in the second round. In other words, his teams provided him quality players to develop.\n\nThe Cowboys must do the same. Fortunately, they have a couple of first-round picks to take care of such a task.",

    "fullText": "On Friday morning Dan Szymborski released the long-awaited Cardinals 2026 ZiPS projections and gave us all a short break from refreshing MLB Trade Rumors to see the latest on Brendan Donovan. ZiPS is the gold standard for publicly available projection systems and has been continuously refined to improve accuracy since Szymborski originally developed it in the early 2000s. If you haven’t yet, make sure to check out the full set of projections.\n\nThe first sneak peek was originally tweeted out on Thursday.\n\nA sneak peek at the ZiPS x @FanGraphs Depth Chart for the final ZiPS team, the St. Louis #Cardinals.#ZiPS26 pic.twitter.com/OsjW46VJPr\n\n— Dan Szymborski (@DSzymborski) January 22, 2026\n\nAt first glance this looks better than expected! It is important to note that the graphic above is based on the ZiPS projected rate stats, but the playing time allocation is based on the FanGraphs Depth Chart page, so the WAR totals in the graphic are not meant to line up with the ZiPS projection tables in the article. This also means that we cannot just add up the WAR totals to get a projected win total. The team projections will come out closer to the start of the season and are based on millions of simulations that account for much more variability and nuance than midpoint projections. With that lengthy caveat out of the way, I do think it is still worthwhile to see how the team’s projections stack up with the projections going into last year as well as the actual results in 2025.\n\nThe Cardinals rotation was sneakily horrible last year thanks to the 250 innings given to Miles Mikolas and Erick Fedde, so even with the loss of Sonny Gray, the group as a whole won’t have to do much to improve.  Despite lacking a true standout, ZiPS sees enough depth to piece together a reasonable staff. While it may be deep, the rotation is also lacking upside. Dustin May is the only starting pitcher expected to open in the rotation with a projected strikeout rate over 20%. The Cardinals bullpen performed exceptionally well in 2025, so there is a lot of regression baked into the 2026 outlook. Getting a few breakout performances and/or starters moving to the pen and seeing their stuff play up will be a huge factor in the team’s 2026 storyline. Overall, I didn’t see too many surprises in the projections, but a few that stood out to me were:\n\nHunter Dobbins is given a projection a little too close to Aaron Wilkerson for my liking. He will probably always be a pitch to contact guy, but he is going to need to strike out more than 15.8% of batters to make much of an impact.\n\nMichael McGreevy projects as the staff ace as the only starting pitcher with an ERA+ greater than 100 and is given a 20% chance of putting up a 3+ WAR season.\n\nJoJo Romero is projected for almost half the bullpen WAR at 0.9. Hopefully some general manager saw the ZiPS release and decided to increase the prospect value they are willing to offer…\n\nOn the position player side of things, you can see the hole at first base left by the Willson Contreras departure. The rest of the infield projects slightly better than last year’s projections and results. One thing to note here is that the Depth Charts page is only giving Wetherholt 371 plate appearances, so there is some upside there if he performs in line with his ZiPS projections and earns a full season’s worth of plate appearances. The outfield was projected to be terrible going into last season and was able to meaningfully underperform even from that baseline. Nootbaar and Scott get solid projections in left and center field. Walker is projected for 518 plate appearances, which surely will not happen if he struggles as much as last year.\n\nLooking a bit deeper at the individual player projections, Donovan, Nootbaar, Winn, and Burleson project about as expected. Winn’s offense backing up a bit in 2025 hurt his outlook, but that is made up for by his improved defensive projection. His 80th percentile outcome of a 4.5 WAR season seems a little light given that he was on track to eclipse that for most of last year before fading late while dealing with the knee injury.\n\nWhile the pitching projections didn’t offer many surprises, there were a bunch of position player projections that jumped out to me.\n\nJJ Wetherholt is projected for 2.9 WAR with a 100 OPS+ and above-average defense. While not flashy, this is an incredibly positive projection for a player with one full minor league season under his belt. ZiPS incorporates exit velocity data into the model, so it is good to see that Wetherholt was not knocked too much for his average performance on those metrics.\n\nIvan Herrera is projected for a 125 OPS+. Going into last season he was projected at 103, so it is good to see that the computer believes in his offensive breakout. The model does incorporate injury data, but I am assuming it is not aware of the saga around Herrera’s arm problems and his impassioned pursuit of the starting catcher role. If he is able to catch 80-100 games, I think he would easily surpass his 80th percentile WAR projection of 3.5.\n\nJordan Walker maybe shouldn’t be classified as a surprise, but you still hate to see a below replacement projection. The Cardinals still seem to believe in his upside and I am inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt as they try to sort through Walker’s issues.\n\nNolan Gorman projecting for 1.9 WAR and above-average defense was one of the biggest surprises for me. It will be interesting to see how much leeway he is given early in the year.\n\nJimmy Crooks is given a 2 WAR projection with an 89 OPS+. This was similar to the projection he received going into 2025. It is good to see that the computer still believes in him after a relatively lackluster AAA performance.\n\nNathan Church didn’t convince the computer that his 2025 breakout was for real, as he still projects below average offensively and defensively.\n\nBryan Torres has a steadily growing fan club and can now count ZiPS among his admirers with a 105 OPS+. His -8 defensive rating hurts his overall value projection and will be something to keep an eye on if he breaks camp with the Cardinals.\n\nFinally, a few prospects that don’t project to open in St. Louis but that had encouraging projections were:\n\nJoshua Baez getting a 94 OPS+ projection is super exciting. I was worried the computer would hold his high strikeout rate in the lower minors against him. He is projected for a 29% strikeout rate, so it is still a risky profile, but it also means there is more upside if he keeps the swing and miss in check as he moves up.\n\nDeniel Ortiz was one of the breakout offensive prospects of the 2025 season. A projected OPS+ of 81 is incredibly solid for a player who has not yet reached Double-A. It is good to see ZiPS is not overly concerned with his high strikeout rate.\n\nLeonardo Bernal continues to get love with a league average WAR projection. It is hard to see him getting much time this year, but he is still moving in the right direction.\n\nAll things considered, I am encouraged by where the projections landed. These aren’t the Cardinals from the last several decades that pump out 88+ win projections, but they still have the underlying attribute of depth that made those teams successful. Szymborski himself mentioned that this looks like a .500 team, which would surpass most fans’ expectations. I do think in all the talk of the rebuild, some fans are overlooking the importance of winning games in 2026. The Cardinals have a good farm system, but it is not the kind of system that can take a true-talent 70 win team and turn it into a World Series contender in a couple of years. If the 2026 team can meet or exceed the ZiPS expectations, the Cardinals will be primed for a competitive window moving forward.",

    "fullText": "Sean McVay turned 40 on Saturday.\n\nNot that the Rams’ ninth-year coach planned to celebrate.\n\n“What’s a good birthday?\" he said on Friday. \"When I’m working on my birthday — and if I’m working next week.\n\n“That would be a hell of a birthday. That’s the only present I want.”\n\nMcVay was busy this week preparing for Sunday’s NFC championship game against the Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field.\n\nAfter splitting their NFC West games this season, they will meet for a third time to determine who will represent the conference in Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara.\n\nMcVay is 2-0 in NFC championship games, having led the Rams past the New Orleans Saints in the 2018 playoffs and past the San Francisco 49ers in the 2021 playoffs.\n\nThe Rams and Seahawks are playing for the third time. That’s nothing new for McVay.\n\nThe Rams have been in this situation twice before — and both times they advanced.\n\nIn the 2020 season, the Rams and Seahawks split their NFC West games, and the Rams won a wild-card game, 30-20, at Seattle.\n\nIn 2021, the Rams lost both regular-season games against the San Francisco 49ers, and the Rams won the NFC championship, 23-20, at SoFi Stadium.\n\nThis season, the Rams beat the Seahawks, 21-19, at SoFi Stadium, and lost to the Seahawks, 38-37, in overtime at Seattle.\n\n“It is an added layer but it's really just the familiarity,” McVay said of playing the Seahawks three times this season. “Let's put together the best plans that we can for our guys and let's understand what type of execution and what type of competitive stamina it's going to take for us to go get the job done against as complete a football team as there is in this league and as hot of a football team as there is in this league.”\n\nThe Rams defeated the Carolina Panthers in the wild-card round, and advanced to the conference championship with a 20-17 overtime victory over the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford and receiver Puka Nacua are first-team All-Pros, and finalists for NFL most valuable player and offensive player of the year, respectively. Receiver Davante Adams led the NFL with 14 touchdown catches.\n\nEdge rusher Jared Verse, lineman Kobie Turner, linebacker Nate Landman and safety Quentin Lake lead the defense.\n\nThe Seahawks, as the top-seeded team, had a first-round bye. They advanced by defeating the 49ers, 41-6, at Lumen Field.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold and All-Pro receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba lead the offense. Defensive lineman Leonard Williams, linebacker Ernest Jones and cornerback Devon Witherspoon were second-team All-Pro.\n\nRams: OL Rob Havenstein (ankle, out); OLB Byron Young (knee, questionable but expected to play).\n\nSeahawks: OL Josh Jones (knee/ankle, questionable); OL Amari Kight (knee, doubtful); FB Robbie Ouzts (neck, questionable); LB Chazz Surratt (ankle, out).\n\nThe Rams and Seattle Seahawks will play at 3:30 p.m. PST on Sunday. The game will be shown on Fox and Fox Deportes (Español). In Southern California, fans can listen to the game on 710, 93.1 FM and 1330 AM (Español).\n\nGary Klein's pick: The Seahawks looked formidable in their divisional-round rout of the 49ers.

    "description": "If the Denver Broncos want to secure a victory against the New England Patriots, these three players need to perform well.",
    "fullText": "It’s the calm before the storm. On Sunday, the Denver Broncos will host the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. The winner punches their ticket to Santa Clara, while the loser will have all offseason to analyze how and where they fell short. In order for the Broncos to be victorious on Sunday, these are three players I believe need to perform well.\n\nLast Saturday against the Buffalo Bills, standout edge rusher Nik Bonitto had two huge plays that resulted in turnovers that helped the Broncos advance. This weekend, they will need the fourth-year pro to continue his career year and find a way to help disrupt the Patriots’ offense.\n\nQuarterback Drake Maye has had a phenomenal season. However, the Patriots’ offensive line has given up a lot of sacks. Even Maye’s biggest supporters concede him holding onto the ball too long has been an issue. While the second-year signal caller performed very well in the regular season, but his production has tapered off going against two strong defenses to start his playoff journey.\n\nI’m optimistic Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph will come up with a great game plan and find a way to disrupt New England’s passing offense. Bonitto and the rest of the defensive front seven will play a huge role in that. Asking for multiple turnovers or even one is a big ask, but I’d settle for Bonitto’s prowess coming off the edge and rattling Maye on a consistent basis good enough. Heck, maybe he can even get him to throw a rare interception.\n\nNik Bonitto was fantastic last week—and might be the Broncos’ best chance at pulling off the upset this weekend. @BenjaminSolak pic.twitter.com/WXS0U8BnXX\n\n— Mina Kimes (@minakimes) January 23, 2026\n\nVeteran quarterback Jarrett Stidham squares off against the franchise that drafted him seven seasons ago. That’s one big story angle for this weekend’s game. Throughout the week, Head Coach Sean Payton and Stidham’s teammates have given him a lot of praise and vowed confidence in his abilities. Even Patriots Offensive Coordinator Josh McDaniels, who spent multiple years coaching him, lauded his intelligence, arm strength and character.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned throughout the week, the Broncos don’t need a Herculean effort from Stidham. And it’s definitely not a game where it’s all on his shoulders. It’s a team game. Truth be told, they need him to be efficient and avoid mistakes. That’s still a tough ask—especially considering how great the Patriots’ defense has performed down the stretch.\n\nEven so, I remain optimistic that he can perform well. Jaleel McLaughlin and RJ Harvey will have to help support Stidham by being effective running game. If they can do that, I expect Stidham to be able to convert on third downs and help move the chains. He is a strong intermediate passer with a good arm. But Denver will also need to protect him well which brings me to my third and final player to discuss as a key to Sunday’s game.\n\nSean Payton, an hour ago…\n\n\"I'm not worried about Stiddy in this game. I'm worried about everyone else and how we play. That really is the truth.\"\n\nFind you someone who believes in you like Sean Payton believes in Jarrett Stidham. pic.twitter.com/3QFuTp6hrD\n\n— Peter Schrager (@PSchrags) January 23, 2026\n\nIn his ninth season with the Broncos, offensive tackle Garett Bolles arguably has put together best season to date. His topflight pass protection and run blocking earned him his second Pro-Bowl designation along with being an All-Pro for the first time in his career.\n\nIt’s safe to say Bolles has come a long way since being Denver’s first-round selection in the 2017 NFL Draft. Once a player who was booed due to his inconsistent performances and penalties, Bolles is the team’s longest-tenured player. Not only that, but of its most important leaders on and off the field.\n\nThe former Utah Ute has performed at a high level all year long. Protecting Stidham and helping get the run game going will be two important factors to help Denver achieve victory. I fully expect #72 to be able to hold his own in this one.\n\nHe’s been through every single up and down the franchise has endured the past nine years. All things considered, I believe he will come up clutch in the biggest game of his impressive career. He has been a great Bronco, and someday I will envision Bolles will rightfully earn his space in the franchises Ring of Fame.\n\nGarett Bolles: 2025 Pass Blocker of the Year \n\n🛡️ Highest-graded pass-blocker (90.8)\n🛡️ Most PBLK snaps with 0 sacks allowed (714) pic.twitter.com/yKSTB2Rah6\n\nHow about you, Broncos Country?

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs continue their coaching staff shake-up with another significant change. Head coach Andy Reid continues to readjust his staff after recently parting ways with long-time associate Todd Pinkson.\n\nAccording to the Kansas City Star's Sam McDowell, Pinkston was let go after being hired by the team in 2023. The former wide receiver under Reid with the Philadelphia Eagles won a Super Bowl title with the Chiefs in his first season on the staff.\n\nThere are four changes to the Chiefs coaching staff so far, per sources:\n\nThey have fired RBs coach Todd Pinkston and WRs coach Connor Embree.\n\nLouie Addazio chose to move on for the OL job at UNLV. Alex Whittingham has joined the Michigan staff.\n\nCould be more after the carousel…\n\n— Sam McDowell (@SamMcDowell11) January 15, 2026\n\nThe Chiefs have already parted ways with wide receiver coach Conner Embree and will be welcoming Eric Bieniemy as their new offensive coordinator. Pinkston's history with Reid dates back to his playing days, showing his loyalty to the system and signaling drastic changes after a disappointing 2025 season.\n\nKansas City's running game lacked explosion all season due to injuries, and big plays were rare from the position. Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco led the team in rushing, with Hunt finishing with 611 yards and Pacheco with 462 yards. Rookie running back Brashard Smith contributed with 151 yards on the ground but proved to be a versatile threat in the passing game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kansas City Chiefs part ways with longtime Andy Reid associate",

    "description": "Brenna Huckaby lost her leg to cancer when she was 14 years old. Then she discovered snowboarding, and it opened her entire world.",
    "fullText": "If we could ski down a mountain, then when we got home, we were able to conquer everyday life things.\n\nAt the time, Brenna Huckaby didn’t fully realize what the idea behind that rehabilitative trip to Utah would mean to her.\n\nShe had been diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and lost her right leg at 14. To that point, conquering everyday things had meant wearing her prosthetic leg consistently.\n\nBut the trip, sponsored by her hospital, which sent Huckaby and kids who lost mobility from osteosarcoma to the slopes, opened up her world.\n\n\"I fell in love with it immediately,\" she tells USA TODAY Sports. \"It was the first sport that I had found just not only (an) incredible challenge, but also this fear and this knowing that I could do it, and I wanted to do it.\"\n\nHuckaby, now 30, became an American Paralympic snowboarder who will once again be competing at the Olympics, this time at Milano Cortina. She won gold and bronze at Beijing in 2022.\n\nHave you ever taken the time to think about what sports, especially your favorite sport, means to you?\n\nWe caught up with Huckaby, who would also become the first Paralympian to appear in the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated and is now a sports mom, about how sports can give us the confidence to take on life’s biggest challenges.\n\nIf we set a goal, and we push ourselves, we can reap their benefits at no matter what level we achieve.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nHuckaby spoke to USA TODAY Sports on behalf of Hershey’s for the “It’s Your Happy Place” campaign. Athletes partnered with the chocolate and candy company to showcase how happiness is not only found in winning, but sweet, everyday moments.\n\nThose moments, she says, \"don’t have to be big and explosive.\" The small ones can matter the most.\n\n\"I feel like that's been my main focus the last eight years,\" she says. \"How can I enjoy the process, enjoy the journey, not just the destination? And I feel like that's way easier said than done. I've learned that taking time to pause, to slow down, to be in the moment, that's how I have found happiness, presence, gratitude, all the things that make me feel good. It’s been in those tiny moments throughout the day.\"\n\nAs young athletes (and parents), if we take the time to reflect on what we’re doing as we race to our different sports events, we can improve our awareness. Huckaby’s sport, she says, is mostly mental, and that part of her game helps her push through the excruciatingly physical parts.\n\n\"I feel like I don't make progress and grow unless I am mentally present and in a good headspace to learn,\" she says.  \"I would say the sooner that you can take moments to reflect on – whether it's your training in the gym or a practice that you had – what was hard, what was good, what do you want to improve on, and what did it teach you about yourself? When you can start practicing that, it makes the things that you've learned so much easier.\n\n\"Then you're able to see those moments of growth and (be) like, 'Wow, like I'm so glad that I learned that. And I'm so glad I pushed through that because I've got this thing that I'm dealing with at home and I know that I can take the mindsets from sport and apply it here.'\"\n\nReflection has helped Huckaby realize she performs her best when she’s calm. She works with a sports psychologist to help her channel her strength to high stakes situations.\n\nDo you remember the instance where you either discovered your favorite sport or realized it was the one you love most?\n\nHuckaby, who has two older brothers (Jordan and Jeremy), loved to jump around as a little girl. Jeremy, her middle brother, and her parents were really into martial arts, which she tried. Her instructor pulled her parents (Jeff and Kristie) aside and told them, \"You need to put her in gymnastics.\"\n\n\"What I loved the most was learning how to do flips in the gym and that's what my martial arts teachers would just teach me because that was all I could stay focused for,\" she says. \"So my parents listened and also they were tired of me doing cartwheels in the house and stuff, and they thought it was a way to save their TV.\"\n\nHuckaby's cancer, which led to the amputation, ended her gymnastics career. But, Huckaby says, she thought about how she loved moving her body and chasing adrenaline.\n\n\"When snowboarding came to me, 'I was like, this is it,'\" Huckaby says.\n\nShe moved to Utah, about a year after the hospital-led trip with her mom, who worked as a nurse there. The rest of the family stayed at their home in Louisiana, and Kristie moved back home when her daughter graduated high school.\n\n\"It gave me opportunity to just heal from cancer through snowboarding,\" Huckaby says. \"Sports (is) such a great way to understand life in the way that it challenges you and the way that you intimately get to know who you are.\n\n\"You gain so much confidence in your body and what your body's capable of. So during cancer, I never really questioned that I could handle it. I put myself in extreme situations through gymnastics training that I knew that I could handle what was to come.\n\n\"I think now as I've been doing this at a professional level for so long, I've learned, 'How do I put that more into my everyday life so that I'm not just an athlete?'\"\n\nHuckaby says she doesn’t so much balance her life, but embraces what’s important to her through every season.\n\nWhen she’s home, she trains vigorously but finds family time every day with her husband, Tristan Klegg, and young school-aged daughters, Lilah and Sloan. Klegg, a former snowboard cross athlete, realizes he sometimes needs to be at home with the girls at times over being with his wife. But they interact daily.\n\n\"He takes care of our kids while I'm away and when I'm training and (is) such a big support, making sure that we win, right?\" she says. \"It's a team effort for sure.\n\n\"I'm in the gym in the offseason three to five days a week,\" she says, \"and I say three to five because we're human. It's life, you know? So the ideal, the perfect, is five. The reality is usually three, and during that period, you're going really hard. And so those off days are really important. And then between snowboard season and gym season, we have two weeks off. We are encouraged to have fun and move our body in ways that feel good, but it doesn't have to be intense. It's just, 'Take time off.'\n\n“And then I usually give myself a fall break. I know that it's good for my mental health. So usually as Halloween starts rolling around, I'm less intense and then I crank back up (in) November, and then most of December and then (the) holidays, I give myself permission to just chill. Because I know it's about to get serious after Christmas.\n\n\"It's (about) finding a rhythm, but I absolutely rest.\"\n\nLilah and Sloan, Huckaby’s daughters, like skateboarding, wakeboarding, wake surfing and other action sports near their home in Montana.\n\nLilah, her older daughter, has tried gymnastics and does aerial silks, which Huckaby describes as art-based body movements.\n\n\"We're active,\" she says. \"That's where we're trying to shine. I don't ever want them to think anything has just been given to me and easy. Of course, there are moments that it looks easy and it's because of all the decades of work that I've put in on my body and then my mind. And so things look like they come together naturally, but, I love the phrase, 'An overnight success was not built overnight.' It was built, you know, a decade before, just quietly working.\n\n\"Like yesterday, I did not want to go to the gym. It was my third day of two-a-days and I was just like, 'I don't want to go.' And they saw that, and I got up and I went.\"\n\nBut Huckaby also never wants her daughters to think that she’s fearless. She has been scared many times, whether it's during training, free riding or competing.\n\n“But I'm brave, and I do it anyway, and I do it scared, and I trust my training, and I trust myself, and I hope that they learn to do that for themselves,\" she says.\n\nHuckaby was horrified, she says, when Sports Illustrated approached her to pose for its 2018 swimsuit edition. She thought she wasn’t confident enough to put herself out in the world in that way.\n\n\"Then I just thought about my 14-year-old self who had just lost her leg and was bald at the time and just felt unbeautiful and unworthy, and I remembered that she deserved to be represented in a way that she wanted to, and to be seen as someone who could be beautiful and could be lovable. And so I wanted to give that to her, and I'm so proud of myself for doing that.\"\n\nIn a similar way, we sometimes have to put ourselves, or our kids, out there for our first big competition. It’s a risk, for sure, but then that rush of adrenaline can come, the one you only get from sports.\n\n\"Bet on yourself,\" Huckaby says, \"because you're worth investing in. If you want it, go for it. If you feel like you have what it takes and you love what you're doing, go out there and give yourself the time to do it and the opportunity to do it because that's what matters more than when you got into your sport. It’s never too late.\"\n\nWe don’t need to have it all figured out. We might just need more perspective on what we’re doing, and what we’re spending.\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

After practice on Wednesday, Stidham was asked about his decision to re-sign with the Broncos in 2025.\n\n“There are always opportunities out there and stuff, but I think at the end of the day, there was a combination of things that went into my decision to come back here,\" Stidham said. \"I believe in Sean [Payton], and Davis [Webb] and Joe [Lombardi], and our room, and being behind Bo and helping him grow. I take a lot of pride in that.\n\n\"I felt like, over the last two years that I was here, that I got a lot better. I think the way Davis has coached us over these last three years now has really helped all of us improve. That’s just one thing I wanted to come back and be a part of. I felt like being here the last two years, and coming in with Sean, and signing and everything, it’s pretty evident that he has the train rolling in the right direction. I don’t think anybody can argue that, and I wanted to be a part of it.”\n\nStidham was one of Payton's first free agent signings when the coach arrived in 2023, and Payton has made it clear that he has faith in Stidham. After three years in a backup role, Stidham now gets an opportunity to step up and make history. Sunday's game (1:00 p.m. MT) will be nationally televised on CBS (more TV info).\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Jarrett Stidham explains why he re-signed with Broncos in 2025",

    "description": "Let’s take a look at the coaches who seem most likely to run John Harbaugh’s defense.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants are continuing to search for a defensive coordinator for John Harbaugh’s defense. Here is some background on four candidates who are continually mentioned.\n\nThe 45-year-old former Miami Dolphins’ defensive coordinator seems like the leader in the clubhouse for the Giants’ job. Except for all of those pesky head-coaching interviews he keeps getting.\n\nThere are currently five head-coaching openings remaining in this hiring cycle — Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals, Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nWeaver has interest from the Steelers and Bills for their vacancies. He interviewed with the Steelers in-person on Friday. He received an interview request from the Cardinals, but it is not clear that ever took place. He interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons before they hired Kevin Stefanski, and had two interviews with the Baltimore Ravens before they chose Jesse Minter.\n\nWeaver was defensive coordinator of the Houston Texans in 2020, and the Miami Dolphins for the past two seasons. He was in Baltimore working for Harbaugh as defensive line coach for three seasons, 2021-2023.\n\nWeaver started his NFL coaching career in 2012 working under Rex Ryan with the New York Jets. He has also coach with the Cleveland Browns and Buffalo Bills.\n\nWeaver, a defensive tackle as a player, was a second-round pick by the Ravens in 2002 and had a seven-year NFL career with Baltimore and Houston.\n\nThere is no doubt how Harbaugh feels about him. Here is what Harbaugh said about Weaver before the Dolphins hired him away from the Ravens to be defensive coordinator in 2024:\n\nHere’s what Ravens coach John Harbaugh said about Anthony Weaver. He spoke rather glowingly about him.pic.twitter.com/Vf8Ry4YJOv https://t.co/yS1KH9ESBR\n\n— David Furones (@DavidFurones_) February 2, 2024\n\nLeonhard, 43, has never coached for a Harbaugh — John or Jim. He did play for John Harbaugh in 2008, Harbaugh’s first as Ravens’ head coach.\n\nLeonhard played in the NFL for 10 seasons. He coached at Wisconsin from 2016-2022, serving as defensive coordinator beginning in 2017. He joined Sean Payton’s Denver Broncos staff in 2024 and has spent the last two seasons working under Payton and Vance Joseph. He has been defensive backs coach, pass game coordinator, and in 2025 was the Broncos’ assistant head coach.\n\nThe problem for Leonhard might be timing. The Senior Bowl begins on Tuesday in Mobile, Ala., and there is a belief that the Giants would like to have their offensive and defensive coordinators in place by then if possible.\n\nLeonhard’s Broncos play Sunday in the AFC Championship Game. If they win and go to the Super Bowl, that timeline won’t work. Even if they lose, Leonhard would have to interview, be offered and accept the job on Monday and join the Giants’ contingent on Tuesday in Alabama.\n\nThe 43-year-old Wilson is familiar to Harbaugh, and to the Giants. Wilson was Harbaugh’s defensive backs coach in Baltimore in 2023 before becoming Tennessee Titans defensive coordinator for the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Wilson also interviewed for the Giants’ job in 2024, but chose to take the Tennessee job.\n\nWilson’s defenses in Tennessee did not rank highly, but the Titans won just six games in two seasons and Wilson didn’t have a lot to work with.\n\nWilson had a supporter in Tennessee star defender Jeffery Simmons:\n\nJeffery Simmons understands it's not up to him BUT if he has it his way, he'd love to have Dennard Wilson back with the #Titans. pic.twitter.com/Kc4Qhxurko\n\n— TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) December 31, 2025\n\nWilson interviewed with the Los Angeles Chargers, coached by Jim Harbaugh, for their defensive coordinator vacancy on Friday.\n\nJones, defensive backs coach and defensive pass game coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, is probably an underdog for the job.\n\nJones did interview with Harbaugh earlier in the week. He also interviewed for the Giants’ job in 2024.\n\nJones’ NFL resume includes stops with the Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, and two stints with the Vikings. Jones has also coached in high school, at the Division II level, in the FCS, FBS, and in the Canadian Football League.\n\nJones has also drawn interest from the Dallas Cowboys , New York Jets, and Green Bay Packers.",

    "description": "The International Football Association Board plan to introduce a couple of major refereeing changes at this summer’s World Cup, according to a report.Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty ImagesThe Internatio...",
    "fullText": "The International Football Association Board (IFAB) held their annual business meeting earlier this week, and they approved a few ideas for implementation at the World Cup this summer.\n\nMany of the changes focus on timewasting, with the BBC reporting that IFAB plan to introduce a countdown for goal-kicks and throw-ins, similar to the countdown that currently exists when goalkeepers have the ball in their hands.\n\nJust like with the current rule, if a player fails to put the ball back into play before the countdown ends, possession will switch to the opponent. Goal-kicks will become corners, a throw-in for one team will become a throw-in for the other. But it’s unclear exactly how long the countdown will last.\n\nIn another rule change, substituted players must leave the pitch in 10 seconds, otherwise their replacement won’t be able to come on immediately and the team making the sub will have to temporarily play with 10 players.\n\nA third change is that players who leave the field with an injury will also have to stay off for an extended period. Again, it’s not yet clear exactly how long, with the Premier League currently requiring a 30-second absence and the MLS requiring two minutes.\n\nThe last major changes are to VAR. Firstly, all corners will be reviewed by VAR at the World Cup, with IFAB believing the checks will almost always be complete before the kick is taken.\n\nSecondly, VAR can overturn a second yellow card if one is clearly incorrectly awarded (but it can’t recommend giving a second yellow if the referee doesn’t award one on-field).\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case that all of these changes will make it into domestic football next season. The VAR system itself was introduced at the 2018 World Cup, but it wasn’t brought in by the Premier League until 2019/20.\n\nBut any changes that work well on football’s biggest stage will undoubtedly lead to calls for the Premier League to implement them too.",

    "description": "Trump gave defaulted student-loan borrowers a major break on wage garnishment and tax refund seizure. Still, thousands are waiting for debt relief.",
    "fullText": "If there's one thing student-loan borrowers are familiar with, it's uncertainty — and there's a lot of that right now.\n\nAround the time it was set to take effect in early January, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced that it was pausing wage garnishment and tax refund seizures for defaulted student-loan borrowers. This gives borrowers behind on payments more time to find a way back to good standing, but it's unclear how much time they'll have.\n\nAs to when that pause will lift, not even servicers appear to know. An employee at a major student-loan servicer told Business Insider that they received communications about the pause just days before it was announced to the public, and they do not know when garnishment and treasury offsets will resume.\n\nWhile the pause is good news for borrowers and provides them with relief as tax season commences, student-loan forgiveness backlogs continue to weigh on the thousands waiting for their relief to be processed. A recent court filing from the Department of Education said that 734,221 income-driven repayment applications were pending as of December 31, 2025, and that 3,400 discharges were approved in December.\n\nThe department wrote in its filing that litigation over the SAVE income-driven repayment plan is preventing it from processing some borrowers' debt relief applications. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments and a short timeline to debt relief, has been blocked since July 2024, and the department's filing said that it is focusing on processing income-based repayment discharges for borrowers who became eligible for relief before April 2025, the month that the block on SAVE was expanded in court.\n\nDuring this time, the department said that it is \"evaluating the most effective way to resume discharges for the borrowers who would have become eligible under the SAVE Plan Final Rule criteria after the date of the injunction. Currently, the only cancellations taking place are for IBR borrowers who became eligible before April 2025.\"\n\nThe pause on consequences for defaulted borrowers provides some relief, while the pause on forgiveness processing prolongs uncertainty — and, with more repayment changes on the horizon, student-loan borrowers have described feeling stuck in limbo, unable to financially plan. Some policy experts and lawmakers have also said that while the pause for defaulted borrowers is needed relief, the uncertainty could put borrowers at risk.\n\nThe department said in a press release last week that the delay in collections is intended to give borrowers \"additional time to evaluate these new repayment options once they consolidate their loans or complete a repayment or rehabilitation agreement.\"\n\nWith all of the back-and-forth policy changes, it's difficult to keep track of what is, and isn't, happening for student-loan borrowers.\n\nThe main change that defaulted borrowers need to know is that their wages and other federal benefits should not be seized until the Department of Education announces that the pause is lifted.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is committed to helping student and parent borrowers resume regular, on-time repayment, with more clear and affordable options, which will support a stronger financial future for borrowers and enhance the long-term health of the federal student loan portfolio,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement last week.\n\nMeanwhile, borrowers should prepare for looming repayment changes, which were signed into law in Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nBeginning in July, the department will begin rolling out new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees. Additionally, over 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE could be kicked off the plan sooner than anticipated; the department announced a proposed settlement that, if approved, would give SAVE borrowers a limited time to enroll in a new plan and face higher payments.\n\n\"I'm bracing for an astronomical bill,\" Brenda McCoy, a 60-year-old borrower on SAVE, previously told Business Insider.",

    "description": "Precious metals markets saw record inflows in 2025, with investors reacting to US economic volatility, tariffs, and \"Sell America\" sentiment.",
    "fullText": "Jeremy Cerza, a 45-year-old retail investor, admits he isn't that experienced in markets, but even he knows metals stole the show in 2025.\n\nGold and silver were among the best-performing investments last year— and should the S&P 500 drop more than 1% for five days in a row, Cerza says he's jumping into the rally, with a plan to yank money out of the US stocks and plough around $20,000 into precious metals.\n\nWhile he's concerned about a bubble, his faith in the Trump administration and the US economy is shaky enough that he thinks the risk will be worth the reward. He said if Trump keeps up his aggressive rhetoric on Greenland, he'd likely pull money from domestic markets.\n\n\"There's too much volatility in US markets currently, in my opinion,\" Cerza added.\n\nA lot of investors felt that way in 2025, with more people squirreling away money into gold and silver as concerns about inflation, tariffs, and the strength of the US economy dominated the conversation and talk of \"Sell America\" took off.\n\nThat only picked up steam in the second half of the year, with more investors jumping into metals as prices went parabolic. The result? A FOMO-driven, meme-like rally that's taken many investors by surprise — and is leaving some worried that the flight to safety may itself be a bubble.\n\nIt's hard to look at charts of gold and silver and not see the outline of a market mania. Gold finished last year with its best run since 1979, and has soared 73% since the start of 2025.\n\nThat doesn't hold a candle to silver's increase. The metal is up 194% since the beginning of 2025, also notching its best annual performance in decades.\n\nOn average, retail investors poured a net $15 million into gold and a net $7 million into silver investments each day last year, according to data from VandaTrack Research.\n\nChatter about gold and silver has also been strong online. SwaggyStocks, an analytics platform that tracks mentions of investments on r/WallStreetBets, found that the SPDR Gold Shares ETF was the third most talked-about investment on the subreddit last year. The iShares Silver Trust ETF was among the top 20 most-talked about investments, according to data it shared with Business Insider.\n\nBilaal Dhalech, one retail investor, said he began buying gold and silver during the pandemic, but has invested more aggressively in recent years to hedge against inflation and \"excessive money printing.\"\n\nDhalech said he had around $10,000 in physical gold and silver and $11,000 invested in gold ETFs. His ETF holdings have gained 30%, according to screenshots of his brokerage account Business Insider reviewed.\n\n\"I was shocked to see a conservative investment like gold and silver explode. Almost like meme coins,\" Dhalech said of the rally in 2025. \"It's scary to see this much enthusiasm.\"\n\nJesse Gaddis, a public relations professional who works with precious metals companies, said he had been tracking gold for years, back when Donald Trump talked about gold on an episode of The Apprentice.\n\nHe finally began purchasing metals during the pandemic, after his client, a CEO of a precious metals firm, encouraged him to do so. He told Business Insider he had around $20,000 in physical gold and silver and around $15,000 invested in gold and silver ETFs as of last week.\n\n\"I'll be thinking about The Apprentice episode where I was like, 'Damn, I could have had it at $400,'\" he said of gold's price at the time. \"That FOMO comes out.\"\n\nWhen the investments rocketed higher in 2025, Gaddis says he wasn't surprised. He sees gold and silver as a form of \"wealth preservation\" and acknowledges that \"Sell America\" is one reason so many investors jumped into metals.\n\nBullion Exchanges, a gold and precious metals retailer based in New York, says interest in gold and silver has been so hot that the firm doubled its clientele in 2025.\n\nAt its Diamond District location in Manhattan, a line of 10 to 20 people consistently forms outside the doors at all hours of the day. Many of them are buying metals for the first time, Eric Gozenput, the CEO, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's been the wild, wild West the last three months,\" Gozenput said, speculating the firm could have grown 200% were it not for the store's limited capacity and shortages of some metals, like silver.\n\nThe craze for metals comes in two flavors.\n\nOn the one hand, many investors seem to be influenced by prominent gold bugs, who have been more vocal about the virtues of owning metals as tariffs and inflation have become bigger threats, Gozenput said. He said he believes many clients have been learning about trends like the debasement trade, which says the US dollar and dollar-denominated investments will weaken as debts pile up and fiat currency is devalued.\n\nOn the other hand, the strength of the \"Sell America\" trade has drummed up FOMO, as metals enjoy a rally that would make many meme stocks blush.\n\n\"I would say it's a combination of both people have FOMO as well as realizing they're not properly insured with their financial future and investments if they have zero physical precious metals exposure,\" he said.\n\nJeffrey Christian, a commodities expert and the managing director at CPM Group, said he believed \"Sell America\" fueled most of gold's and silver's rally through the end of last summer.\n\nThen, gold prices shot up last August as the Fed signaled it would continue lowering interest rates. At that point, he believes the speculative trade kicked into high gear.\n\n\"That started this, what you call FOMO,\" he said, noting that his clients who were more \"traditional\" metals investors began to pull back as prices rocketed higher.\n\nConcern that the rally has run too far is growing.\n\nChristian said he believed gold could drop as much as 9% and silver could drop as much as 31% if the hype wanes.\n\nDhalech said he didn't believe the metals would crash, though he wouldn't be surprised to see a 10% correction in gold and silver in the near term.\n\nThis past week, Gaddis sold around half of his silver and gold ETFs to take some profits. Business Insider verified his current holdings with screenshots of his brokerage account.\n\n\"It's a nice slow ride up, but it's a quick elevator down,\" he said of a potential correction, adding he knew it would be harder for him to get rid of his physical metals.",

    "description": "When Mike Prytkov lost 44 pounds in a year, he lost a lot of muscle mass too. He's since learned how to maintain his weight in a balanced way.",
    "fullText": "When Mike Prytkov lost 44 pounds in a year, he took the extreme route.\n\nNow, he understands his approach was unhealthy and unsustainable.\n\nIn 2017, the entrepreneur either had one meal a day or ate in an 8-hour window followed by a 16-hour fast, known as the 16:8 diet. He also did three 7-day fasts, when he only drank water.\n\nHe lost weight quickly, but the diet negatively affected his life.\n\n\"I tried to do some workouts, and I had zero strength,\" Prytkov, 38, told Business Insider. \"When the muscles are depleted of energy, just everything is hard.\"\n\nEating so little food, he couldn't get all the nutrients his body needed, and his strict routine affected his family and social life. \"When everyone is having dinner and you're not eating, it can create tension,\" he said.\n\nThen he had a body composition scan and learned that along with fat, he had lost 15 pounds of muscle mass. Muscle is essential for staying strong and mobile, and plays a key role in regulating metabolism.\n\nFasting meant he simply didn't have the energy to fuel a workout or the calorie budget to eat enough protein, both of which are crucial for maintaining muscle mass — but he didn't know it at the time.\n\n\"Now I understand that with better training and nutrition focus it could have been avoided\" he said.\n\nPrytkov focused on creating habits that would sustain both fat loss and support his long-term health.\n\n\"I worked with nutritionists, spoke with many people in the industry, and ran a lot of self-experiments to understand what works best for me,\" he said.\n\nPrytkov added more strength training to his workout schedule of mainly cycling and swimming, and ditched the extreme fasts.\n\nDietitians previously told Business Insider that following a Mediterranean-style diet, which emphasizes fresh produce, lean proteins, and whole grains, and eating around 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, is recommended for maintaining muscle mass, and supporting overall health.\n\nHe shared the three lessons he learned about losing weight sustainably.\n\nPrytkov learned he needed to experiment to lose fat sustainably. It's also OK for your weight, diet, and workout routine to fluctuate depending on your goals and circumstances, he found.\n\nA person with a busy job and three kids will likely have less time to meal prep and go the gym as a college student, for example, he said.\n\n\"It showed me how individual the process is and how deeply it affects your entire life,\" he said.\n\nTreating weight loss like a box you can tick off after 30 days of dieting won't work in the long term, Prytkov said he learned.\n\n\"It's a lifestyle rather than just a one-time effort,\" he said.\n\nIt's unrealistic for people to stick to extreme diets, so they don't lead to long-term change.\n\nForming daily habits that help you maintain a healthy body weight and fit into your lifestyle is \"the best thing you can do for yourself,\" in terms of sustainable weight loss, Prytkov said.\n\nHe likes routine, so for him, eating the same breakfast every morning and working out most days, rather than two or three days a week, works best.\n\nOn social media, we are bombarded with information about how to optimize every aspect of our lives, but Prytkov said he learned that focusing on the basics is key.\n\n\"I tried a lot of approaches and realized that none of the 'extras' matter if the basics are missing,\" he said.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many supplements you take, how much cold exposure you do, or which biohacks you try if, for example, your sleep is poor, Prytkov said.\n\n\"People tend to overeat when they're tired and sleep-deprived,\" he added.\n\nResearch suggests that getting enough good-quality sleep, being physically active, and eating a nutritious diet are what make the biggest difference to the average person's energy and fitness levels, mood, and body composition.\n\n\"If people would do just that without anything else, without any extreme workout routines or extreme biohacking protocols, it would do 95% of the improvement,\" he said.",

    "description": "The Austin push is planned for February, insiders told Business Insider. Tesla has been training Optimus in its Fremont factory for more than a year.",
    "fullText": "Tesla appears to be getting closer to deploying Optimus in its factories — and Austin is the next training ground.\n\nTesla told workers during a town hall last week that it plans to begin collecting data to train its humanoid robot at its Austin Gigafactory, insiders told Business Insider.\n\nThe company is looking to train Optimus how to operate in the Texas facility, it said, adding that it was targeting a February start date.\n\nTesla has been collecting data and training Optimus prototypes in its Fremont, California, factory for more than a year.\n\nThe Optimus data collectors in Fremont are typically kept separate from the general factory workers to avoid interfering with output, people with knowledge of the program said.\n\nThere, data collectors have recorded themselves organizing vehicle parts and working on conveyor belts, Business Insider previously reported. The videos are then used to teach Optimus how to mimic the same movements.\n\nCEO Elon Musk said during an interview at Davos on Thursday that Tesla has the humanoid robot doing \"simple tasks\" in its factory, though he didn't specify which.\n\n\"By the end of this year I think they'll be doing more complex tasks but still deployed in an industrial environment,\" he said. \"By the end of next year I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public.\"\n\nHe warned earlier this week in a post on X that production of Optimus — and the company's Cybercab, which will be produced in Austin — will be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla has been sharing sneak peeks of Optimus' capabilities since the product was first announced in 2021. In 2024, the automaker posted a video that showed the robot arranging batteries while tied to an overhead support structure at the company's lab in Palo Alto. The company said that it deployed two autonomous Optimus robots in one of its factories in 2024.\n\nTesla employs several dozen Optimus trainers. The company's factory workers, who number in the thousands, could be an ideal group to help train the robot due to their expertise and workforce size.\n\nLast year, Tesla moved from primarily training the robot using teleoperation to collecting video data — a strategy that could help the carmaker rapidly collect larger amounts of data without the constraints of motion capture suits, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nTesla's Optimus trainers are outfitted with large helmets with cameras that point in several directions. The helmet is attached to a heavy backpack, which can be unwieldy at times. Tesla has experimented with a lighter fanny pack setup, but it's unclear if the company plans to use it in factory data collection, people with knowledge of the program said.\n\nMusk has pitched Optimus as the \"biggest product of all time.\" He's said the humanoid robot could be the solution to everything from housework and factory work to operating data centers in outer space.\n\nThe town hall also covered non-Optimus developments. The company is working on updating several production lines and construction will continue to be ongoing at the factory.\n\nOver the past year, the carmaker has repeatedly slashed production hours for its Cybertruck line and moved workers to the Model Y line amid lackluster sales numbers for the electric pickup truck.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "Amanda Litman and her husband hosted 52 dinner parties in 2025. It helped them feel less lonely as parents in a big city.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amanda Litman, 35, who lives in New York City. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn December 2024, my husband and I had a three-month-old and two-year-old daughter, and we felt lonely and isolated. Having kids is magical, but it's a lot.\n\nOver the first couple of years of parenthood, we realized that it was really hard to make plans and find time to have conversations with grown-ups. We used to joke that everyone was lonely, but no one could hang out.\n\nYou can chat to other parents at the playground or see them at pickup, but after having kids, you lose the spontaneity of being able to go to the movies or out to dinner, or to a party at the drop of a hat. Things become logistically difficult. We would always question, \"Is the thing we're invited to worth whatever it will cost us to go, plus $150 for a babysitter?\"\n\nWe wanted to create some kind of social anchor in our lives, and my husband suggested that we set a New Year's resolution to host people for dinner every Saturday in 2025.\n\nAt first, I was like, \"I think you're insane. That's a stupid thing to do.\" But he's the cook in our family, not me, so I agreed.\n\nWe made a list of everyone we know, or would like to know, or could possibly plausibly invite, used a spreadsheet as a schedule, and started texting people.\n\nWe'd say, \"Hey, we have a resolution to host people at our house every Saturday. Do you want to come over for dinner X, Y, or Z weekend at five o'clock? Bring the kids!\" And as people would say yes, we would go back and forth with scheduling, and put them on the calendar.\n\nWe live in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City, so we tried to keep the dinner parties relatively contained. Our table can fit up to six people at a stretch, but we also sat on the floor, we ate on our couch, and the kids would climb all over the place.\n\nMost of the time, we'd host between one and three families. Our biggest party had 15 guests (11 adults and four kids), and our smallest had one.\n\nWe had a mix of really longtime friends, new friends, and people we'd never spoken to for more than 20 minutes. Sometimes people knew each other and other times the guests had never met, so we got the chance to help new people connect.\n\nAfter a few weeks, we got into a pretty good rhythm. On Monday, I would message whoever was scheduled for that Saturday, confirming dinner and asking if they had any dietary restrictions.\n\nMy husband used that to figure out what to cook. He likes the opportunity to make something ambitious. Some of my favorites were his Gochujang caramel cookies, lemon bars, lasagna, and fried chicken.\n\nHe would go to the grocery store, then cook a little bit on Thursday night or bake if he was making dessert or bread. He would do a little bit more on Friday night after the girls went to bed, and more on Saturday morning while we fussed around the house and the kids played. When the kids napped, between 1 and 4 p.m-ish, he would finish cooking.\n\nPeople would come over at 5 p.m. and leave around 7 p.m., sometimes 9 p.m., and occasionally 10 p.m. We're 35-year-olds with kids, so it didn't go on until 2 a.m.\n\nEvery Saturday around 3 p.m., when my husband was in the weeds of cooking, worrying about not finishing in time, and the kids were misbehaving, we'd be like, \"Should we just cancel?\" But we never did.\n\nWe felt almost compulsive about keeping our streak alive, and by the end of the evening, we were always glad to have hosted.\n\nI would clean the bathroom and counters and make the house hygienic, not immaculate. It's not a museum, and we made sure that our guests understood that we're welcoming them into our home as imperfect.\n\nAll of our dishes are mismatched because they're from two households combined over the years. We used formula pitchers for water jugs. We're not fancy, but we decided that was fine.\n\nSome weekends it was hard to find people who were in town, and a couple times guests cancelled at the last minute and we had to scramble to invite more people. Sometimes the kids would be chaotic or we'd break a wine glass, but generally, it was manageable.\n\nIn this moment, I think, people feel very lonely, and I'm really glad that we were able to take meaningful actions to fix that in our lives.\n\nDoing this was good for my mental health. 2025 was a hard year. I had two kids under two, I released a book, and my job working in politics was very hard. But despite all of that, I had a social life, time with my family and friends, and a clean bathroom every week. Plus I got to eat a lot of good food.\n\nWhen people are over, I'm not looking at my phone, and I have real adult conversation, which is rare for me, especially outside of work. And some people who used to be just acquaintances are now friends, which I feel like is really hard to do when you're an adult.\n\nI think it was really meaningful to have this thing that we did every week without question. It was just like, \"this is what we do, who are we seeing this week?\"\n\nOne thing I struggled with was letting go of reciprocity. We invite people a lot, but they don't invite us back. I had to remind myself that doesn't mean they don't like us.\n\nEveryone has a different sense of comfort with hosting and with being the planner versus the guest. There's no moral valence to being an inviter, and letting go of keeping score was both hard and important.\n\nWe're very proud that we achieved our resolution, and we're going to try and keep doing it into 2026. We'll be less strict if folks cancel last minute, but we're booked through March right now.",

    "description": "Milica Cvetkovic, said that getting her current job at Google was like training for a marathon — and she wouldn't change much about her journey.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Milica Cvetkovic, a 35-year-old senior technical solutions consultant at Google, based in Chicago. Her identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been working on building AI systems for Google Cloud customers for about three years, but my path to get there was a little non-traditional.\n\nI'm not one of those people who applied to Google 100 times. I took a lot of different routes along the way. My career journey has been wild. \n\nI improvised; I had moments when I was poor without health insurance; I had moments when I was lonely and helpless; I had moments when I messed up and was scared. But I also met the most magical people and had the best adventures. Regardless of how hard it was, I would change very little.\n\nI was born and raised in Serbia, and moved to the US when I was 18. Instead of going to law school in Serbia, I took a gap year, bartended, and then went to college and majored in math.\n\nAfter college, I moved to downtown Chicago and became a bartender. I love bartending. If I had time, I would do it now. Then I moved to New Orleans and worked as a shot girl on Bourbon Street for a while.\n\nNext, I moved to Columbus and worked as a caregiver at a nursing home, which was probably one of the lowest moments of my life. I moved to Columbus, where I knew nobody, and where it was hard to meet new people. Working in the nursing home exposed me to seeing people die for the first time.\n\nThese experiences taught me that discipline matters a lot. When people say you have to work hard, that means you have to have discipline. I am not one of those people who were brought up with this hardcore discipline — I had to build it myself.\n\nEventually, I found a role somewhat related to what I studied and became a curriculum designer at McGraw-Hill Education for four or five years. At some point, I visited friends in Madison, Wisconsin, and decided I wanted to live there.\n\nSo I moved there and started grad school for statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The whole time I was in grad school, I continued working remotely for McGraw-Hill Education.\n\nIn grad school, I began researching how to teach machine learning to nontechnical audiences, specifically computational biologists. That experience, combined with my education in curriculum design, opened a lot of doors for me in education.\n\nDuring my last semester of grad school, I started an internship as a machine learning engineer with a local startup in Madison that was using a device to predict animal health. I ended up working there full-time after grad school and also started teaching, first in bootcamps and eventually at the university level.\n\nAt some point, I didn't want to code 24/7 anymore. I felt like my soft skills weren't being utilized enough. Around that time, I saw that Google had posted my current job, and it was a perfect fit.\n\nI think it's very valuable to have the skill to talk about technical concepts in a way that people are going to understand. The most incredible talks I've heard from accomplished scientists are from those who can talk about their research in an interesting and non-technical way.\n\nYou don't have to kill people with terminology and keywords to make a point. A lot of times when people do that, their audience gets confused. So I think having that ability is probably the most valuable skill that I bring.\n\nI had failures along the way. It's not like everything went smoothly. I'm an immigrant, and for most of the time, I was alone in all of this. I've been through some really stressful situations.\n\nWhen I started teaching at the university level, I worked very hard to get there, and I finally did, but I was super sick. Instead of being upfront about that, I ended up in the ER twice during that class, and I didn't deliver the way I wanted.\n\nYou have to move on in those moments. When you fail, you do damage control, and if the damage control doesn't work, you move on and do better next time.\n\nPeople come from different backgrounds and situations. You don't have to hustle and have 17 different things you do in order to get a Big Tech job. You can be excellent in just one thing; it just turns out I had all those interests.\n\nThere wasn't one experience that made me get the job — it was everything. I worked in education; I was an engineer; I was technical; I had the degrees that mattered; I could speak to non-technical audiences; I had work experience; and I was active in the tech community.\n\nAs someone who ran a marathon, I can say that getting the job at Google was like training for the marathon. The marathon itself is more of a celebration of all the work that you've already done. That's what my application to Google was.",

    "fullText": "The stock market is flashing an inflation warning signal in the first few weeks of 2026 that could mean investors are in for an ugly year ahead.\n\nThat's according to Tom Essaye, the founder of Sevens Report Research, who warned in a note on Friday of a potential 2022-style rout for the traditional 60/40 portfolio.\n\nEssaye pointed out that both energy and materials stocks are surging since the start of the year, rising by more than 9%. That far outpaces the S&P 500's gain of about 1%. Both sectors of the market can be leading indicators of inflation because prices for energy and materials trickle down to costs in other parts of the economy.\n\n\"Energy is obviously a critical input to inflation metrics as oil and gas prices impact every aspect of global trade, travel and logistics. Materials are a lesser discussed, but equally important factor affecting input costs, which inherently add upside pressure to inflation. And the strong YTD performance by these two sectors is not something to ignore as we continue through Q1.\"\n\nHe added: \"Not many analysts have been discussing such a risk, but it is one to keep tabs on.\"\n\nInflation is relatively tame for now, with the Consumer Price Index hitting 2.7% year-over-year in December. That's above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%, but well off of highs seen in 2022, when spiraling prices sparked an aggressive cycle of Fed rate hikes and caused the S&P 500 to dive 25%.\n\nBut the strong materials and energy price action also comes alongside a broader shift from growth to value, and away from mega-cap stocks to small-caps and transportation stocks — warning signs that trouble could lie ahead, Essaye said. He highlighted the sudden outperformance in the S&P 500 equal-weight index, the Russell 2000 index, and the Vanguard Value Index.\n\n\"There has been a widely discussed rotation taking shape away from mega-cap tech, which led markets higher into late 2025, and to the 'rest of the market,'\" Essaye wrote.\n\n\"Those early year money flows are a noteworthy concern, as they are reminiscent of the start to 2022, a year that proved to be one of the most painful for traditional '60/40' equity/bond investors in the last century,\" he continued. \"This is a dynamic that could potentially be poised to repeat itself in 2026, and the YTD sector performance is adding to those concerns.\"\n\nAt the moment, markets widely expect inflation to remain relatively subdued in 2026, pricing in two Fed rate cuts.\n\nAt least one Wall Street bank — JPMorgan — has warned those expectations may be misplaced. The bank made waves earlier this month when it said it sees no rate cuts in 2026, and predicted that the Fed's next interest-rate adjustment would be a hike in 2027.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Bobby Castro and Sofia Castro, the founders of Ortsac, a family office that manages their investments and properties. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBobby: We've been married for 35 years.\n\nWe have two children: Priscilla, 34, and Brandon, 29. They're both married, and we have three grandchildren.\n\nI only have a ninth-grade education, and Sofia only has a 10th-grade education. We were both raised in Miami, and when we met, I was 22, and Sofia was 18. Within six months, we got pregnant, got married, and moved into Sofia's parents' house.\n\nSofia: My dad worked three jobs to maintain seven children, and Bobby's mom worked three jobs to maintain four children. We come from zero money; there were no hand-me-downs.\n\nWhen I met Bobby, he said, \"I don't know how, but I'm going to create my own business. I'm going to work for myself.\"\n\nBobby: I was always a motivator, never an executor.\n\nSchool wasn't for me. When I told my mom that I didn't want to do it anymore, she supported me. She was a waitress all her life, so I quit and worked at a restaurant.\n\nI heard conversations at tables, people talking about business, a different type of conversation than I was having at home.\n\nCuriosity sparked, and I said to my mom, I'm going to be a millionaire. I spent a lot of time talking about it, but didn't do anything about it.\n\nThat changed many years later, when I was living at my in-laws, paying them nothing, no job. I walked outside one afternoon, when everyone else was coming home from work. Sofia pulled up in a black Mustang that her parents bought us for $600, and behind her was Priscilla; they were both smiling at me.\n\nI realized I had to get out of this rut. I got a job at the Rusty Pelican in Key Biscayne, and during the day, I sold memberships for the Better Business Bureau.\n\nI was addicted to classified ads. Anything that said, earn $5,000 a month, become a millionaire. There was an opportunity to be an equipment broker — the middleman between lenders and business owners who need things like a forklift, a grill, an ultrasound.\n\nSofia's mom lent us $1,700 to give it a try. We spent all of our time, energy, and focus on it. It eventually turned into BHG Financial — a company that loaned money to professionals.\n\nSofia: By the time our daughter was five, we were making a nice living, and when our son was born, we were making more than $500,000 a year.\n\nWe wanted to give them what we didn't have. Our parents gave us love and a roof over our heads and made sure we had food on our plates, but we were very poor.\n\nWe didn't want our kids to struggle the way we did.\n\nWe raised them with good morals — respect, kindness — and they never got into any trouble. But we realized, as they got older, that they'd have no clue how to survive in the real world if we took away the financial backing.\n\nWe didn't educate them enough. Starting in junior high, we should have taught them how to handle money, how to create, and how to think about what they want out of life.\n\nBobby: We made some mistakes with our children. We were failing with Priscilla and Brandon.\n\nWe said with Priscilla, our first, we're going to spoil the heck out of her. She's going to have everything.\n\nShe was on \"My Super Sweet 16.\" She got a Mercedes SL 500. The whole nine yards.\n\nAt another point, she wanted to start a shoe business. She didn't have a business plan, but we invested because that's our baby girl. I didn't do any due diligence. That was a great learning lesson for us, as well as for Priscilla, but mistakes are the pivots.\n\nSofia: Priscilla went to college, but school wasn't for her. We told her she had two choices: either come and work for us — at that point, we had started investing in real estate — or look for a career.\n\nWe weren't going to allow our kids to sit there and do nothing, be trust-fund babies.\n\nBobby: When Priscilla and Brandon came to work for our family office, they weren't excited or stimulated about it. They were just being given money without having to ask.\n\nWe heard that 70% of families lose their wealth after the second generation, and we realized we needed help to break the family curse.\n\nSo we reached out to Legacy Capitals, a consulting and advising firm, and created a 100-year legacy plan. We have regular meetings to discuss our assets — our various trusts — what we need to do to preserve them and how to grow them.\n\nSince then, it's night and day. Our son owns apartments that he invests in and is responsible for financing the family office. Our son-in-law is involved in our real estate investment. They are putting in the hours and earning their money.\n\nSofia: Our kids are very involved in writing the agreement.\n\nWe're putting in rules, regulations, and directions. If they want to open a business or go into charity, how are they going to get money for that?\n\nOne mistake Bobby and I made was never having them get a job outside our family business or internships over the summers. That's something that we're putting in the family manual: experience the outside world.\n\nBobby: Another rule: No family member sues another family member. That's one of our core values, because money creates friction.\n\nWe are also working on each family member's role and responsibilities.\n\nA lot of people haven't had conversations with their children about their family's finances, and they're in their 70s or 80s. It's all about communication for us. We have to talk about money, the rules around the money, and how we are going to impact the world.\n\nWe got to it a little too late in life. Our children are doing it correctly with our grandchildren. They can benefit from what we learned. They are really great parents. And it's helped my relationship with them. We travel as a family; they live close by, and we get together and have fun without talking shop.\n\nI'm seeing so many strides forward. Just this week, they closed on an apartment building together. Independently, with their own money, they teamed up with their cousins and bought an 18-unit multifamily apartment building.\n\nI stepped back, let them be in the driver's seat. We are getting there.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dray Jankowski, former employee at CrowdStrike and current senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind. Business Insider verified his identity. This essay has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI still remember the morning I found out I was getting laid off from CrowdStrike.\n\nI went to bed thinking everything was fine, and when I woke up, there was a mysterious meeting on my calendar for later that afternoon.\n\nThat's when I saw the email that said the company was doing a reduction in force as it adjusted to changes driven by AI. It wasn't about financial trouble. It was sudden, impersonal, and final. At 30, it was my first layoff.\n\nI was shaken. I worked hard to get where I was. At CrowdStrike, I was a program manager working closely with the team that makes motion sensors. I also worked at Amazon and Raytheon and consulted with companies such as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. I had what people would consider a \"great résumé.\"\n\nLittle did I know how brutal the job market would become and how hard it would be to find the right fit.\n\nIn the first three months after my layoff, I applied to 52 jobs on my own, and I hated every second of it.\n\nAt first, I wasn't even looking. I had savings, and it was summer. I traveled to Yellowstone, spent time with my mom and my two dogs, and casually applied to roles I actually liked.\n\nInstead of being quiet about my layoff, I also decided to be vocal. I started making YouTube videos and launched a podcast called \"The Reboot Era,\" where I talked openly about layoffs and invited others to share their experiences.\n\nEven with my background, the job-search process was frustrating. I'd turn to ChatGPT with basic questions like, \"Should I update my résumé for this role?\" and I started noticing how many people were stuck for months because they didn't know how to optimize it for applicant tracking systems. When I looked for help online, most of it was locked behind paywalls.\n\nLinkedIn \"Easy Apply\" felt like a black hole. Company websites made me create a new Workday account every time. The process was tedious, slow, and draining. So when an AI-powered application platform reached out to me after seeing my posts about layoffs, I invited them onto my podcast with a catch: I wouldn't promote anything unless I tested it myself and believed it worked.\n\nAt first, the results didn't seem promising. The very first call I got was from a car wash near my house.\n\nA week later, something changed. I started getting legitimate interview requests for corporate roles that matched my experience and salary range. One message on LinkedIn asked if I wanted to interview with a company I'd never even heard of. That's when I knew the AI had applied for me.\n\nOver the course of about a month, the platform sent out 812 applications on my behalf. It also shows you which keywords to hit in your cover letters, and you can set your own parameters.\n\nWith AI handling the repetitive work, I could focus on preparing for interviews, refining my résumé, networking, and continuing my podcast.\n\nIn total, I received five serious interview requests that were aligned with what I wanted. I moved forward with two. One didn't pan out, but the other moved fast. Within two weeks, I had an offer.\n\nThat's how I landed my current role as senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind, a marketing technology company that helps brands re-engage customers who leave their websites without making a purchase.\n\nAI didn't get me the job. It got me the interview. From there, it was on me to show up, connect, and prove I was the right person.\n\nI think the job market is going in the wrong direction.\n\nFirst, companies decide they can automate many standard workflows and lay off workers. Those employees are then pushed back into the open job market, forced to apply for new roles. Now, they face AI screening systems that evaluate them against opaque criteria they can't see or understand.\n\nIf the applicant is using AI as well, they get rejected by the screener AI if they sound too robotic. Then, even when you do get the interview, many offers ask you to meet with a digital recruiter who's not a real person and will ask automated questions.\n\nNone of that seems fair, and it often feels like AI is working against job seekers in this brutal market. It took me more than 800 applications to get one great offer, so it is reasonable if you need help. When used correctly, AI can be the tool that gives you your time and momentum back.",

    "title": "Many future military officers come from Scouting. A Pentagon split could put those ties at risk.",
    "description": "DoD is reportedly considering cutting ties with the Boy Scouts, even as data from military schools shows Scouting is common among future officers.",
    "fullText": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is reportedly considering severing ties with Scouting America, which could mean a consequential break with an organization that has long been closely associated with military service and leadership development.\n\nPublic data from two prominent military schools, West Point and the Naval Academy, shows that Scouting is common among future officers — more than one in ten cadets and about 10% of midshipmen in recent years have a Scouting background.\n\nA memo obtained by NPR in November highlighted Hegseth's desire to halt military support for the Scouts' National Jamboree and group activities on military bases.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to provide a copy of the memo to Business Insider and did not comment on details surrounding any potential separation.\n\n\"The Department will not comment on leaked documents that we cannot authenticate and that may be pre-decisional,\" Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in an email when asked whether the Pentagon still plans to move forward with severing ties.\n\nScouting America did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe Scouts' Jamboree has long been a highly visible point of contact between the military and American youth. In 2017, the event featured a significant military presence — simulated helicopter rescues, displays of tanks and aircraft, flyovers, drill team performances, a special operations challenge, and other opportunities for Scouts to interact directly with service members.\n\nWhether the 2026 Jamboree events will feature similar military involvement remains to be seen (the Jamboree is usually held once every four years.) The reported memo on the Pentagon's intended split with the Scouts decried the organization as \"woke.\"\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America began admitting girls in 2018, while the Girl Scouts remains a separate organization. The group had earlier opened its programs to transgender boys in 2017 and to gay boys in 2013.\n\nIn 2024, before Hegseth became the defense secretary, he remarked that Scouts had been \"cratering\" for some time during a Fox News show. He accused the political left of trying to \"destroy it or dilute it into something that stood for nothing.\"\n\nThis new uncertainty comes at a time of relative stability for military recruiting, after a yearslong crisis that peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Enlistment numbers have rebounded in large part because of a shaky job market and the Army and Navy's preparatory courses, which help otherwise unqualified applicants improve their fitness and test scores enough to qualify for boot camp.\n\nThose pre-boot camp programs have drawn scrutiny though. A government watchdog report last year found they allowed in too many low-scoring recruits, raising concerns about long-term readiness and standards.\n\nEven with recruiting off to a strong start in the new fiscal year, looming challenges remain. A declining national birthrate — expected to become more pronounced over the coming decade — means the military will face a smaller pool of eligible young people in the years ahead. That makes early exposure to service-oriented institutions especially important, said Kate Kuszminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security and author of a recent report on recruiting.\n\nScouting, she told Business Insider, can give young people two things the military has long valued: moral grounding and early exposure to skills that translate to service.\n\n\"The scouting system provides quite a few tangible things well before youth are of recruiting age that could pay dividends in the long run,\" Kuszminski said.\n\nData from West Point highlights that overlap. About 14% of the Academy's graduating class of 2027 reported a background in Scouting, according to the publicly available data. More than half of those former Scouts had earned the Eagle Scout or Girl Scouts' Gold Award.\n\nThe data does not distinguish between male and female Scouts.\n\nThat pattern has held steady in recent years. For the graduating classes of 2022 through 2026, between 13% and 16% of students reported having a Scouting background. In the classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027, the number of former Scouts was nearly equal to the number of cadets who entered West Point from Junior ROTC programs.\n\nComparable data for the Naval Academy is harder to find, but a class profile for the class of 2028 lists roughly 10% of students as former Scouts.\n\nFor some veterans, those numbers are unsurprising. The Scouts have long had some overlap with military service, said David Chetlain, a Navy veteran and former Boy Scout. His own experience in Scouting reinforced a sense of service that he says is increasingly hard for students to find elsewhere.\n\n\"You want to teach young people that they're part of a community and that they should be involved in it,\" Chetlain said. Children learn a lot from team-building activities like school sports, he said, \"but you don't learn citizenship, you don't learn service, and you don't necessarily learn leadership in the same way.\"\n\n\"They're trying to prepare people for life, and those same attributes that make you successful in life will make you successful in the military,\" he added. \"That's why I think the relationship is important.\"\n\nThe reported rift with the Scouts comes as the Pentagon searches for new and innovative ways to sustain recruiting momentum with its new Recruitment Task Force. Few details about its scope or recommendations have been made public.",

    "fullText": "There's a lot to dislike about January, like winter storms that lead to chaos at grocery stores.\n\nIt's not all bad, though. The start of a new year also brings a fresh era of fashion. And what better way to showcase it than with more than a week of runway shows in France?\n\nParis Fashion Week Men's runs from January 20 to January 25. Spring 2026 Couture Week, also in Paris, will follow between January 26 and January 29.\n\nNaturally, some of the most eye-catching looks so far haven't been spotted on the runway. Instead, they're being worn by celebrities in the audience.\n\nHere are the best and worst we've seen.\n\nHe arrived at the Louis Vuitton runway show wearing a textured suit in a warm brown shade. It appeared to be crafted with calf hair.\n\nThe set was tailored perfectly to the musician and served as a fun, neutral base for his accessories. He wore light-brown loafers, a multicolored tie, and a gold watch.\n\nHe also carried a blue Louis Vuitton monogrammed duffel.\n\nPattinson, who starred in \"The Batman,\" attended Dior's Fashion Week event wearing simple pieces from the fashion house.\n\nHe sported a gray tweed blazer over a red-checked button-up shirt. The top half of his outfit worked for him, though it was paired with loose-fitting, lightly distressed jeans and suede shoes.\n\nThe latter two pieces looked too casual. Black trousers and leather loafers would have elevated the look.\n\nThe \"Frankenstein\" actor's Dior ensemble included a floor-length blue skirt and a black fringe jacket cinched at the waist.\n\nThe top half matched her dark hair and leather purse, while her skirt added a subtle pop of color.\n\nThe musician attended Dior's show in wide-legged gray trousers and a fitted blue blazer worn as a blouse. She also wore black leather heels, colorful necklaces, and a white bag covered in heavy fringe.\n\nHer outfit might have been more effective if she'd stuck to one or two colors and chosen one statement accessory instead of mixing many.\n\nThe \"Hamnet\" actor sported black trousers and a blue, striped button-up beneath a gray peacoat. He accessorized with a Dior monogram belt and statement leather shoes.\n\nThe outfit was chic, simple, and the epitome of Dior's menswear designs.\n\nThe musician was photographed at the Dries Van Noten runway show wearing a mix of neutral staples.\n\nHe wore baggy brown pants, a cream-colored coat, a tan turtleneck top, and a thick brown scarf. Then there were his accessories. Harlow wore black boots, silver glasses, and a Kangol hat.\n\nThere was a lot going on with his outfit, but no piece was particularly memorable.\n\nHe attended the Louis Vuitton show wearing a black suit from the fashion house. Rather than opting for a classic, straight style, the \"Stranger Things\" star went with something more modern.\n\nThe suit featured a loose-fitting blazer over a blue-and-white striped button-up shirt. The latter was tucked into barrel-leg trousers, which gave his look a unique shape.",

    "description": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump were among the Davos attendees. The luxurious airplanes matched the grandeur of the high-flyers who  went to the WEF.",
    "fullText": "Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.\n\nThat meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too.\n\nBusiness Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week.\n\nOn Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents.\n\nThe majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF.\n\nOthers landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance.\n\nFrom Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft.\n\nOn Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s.\n\nThroughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nGulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views.\n\nBusiness jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower.\n\nIt's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats.\n\nThese are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million.\n\nFlight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday.\n\nSome governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands.\n\nDue to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft.\n\nSometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too.\n\nBusiness Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers.\n\nThe first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one.\n\nA handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer.\n\nIt's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet.\n\nAccording to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail.\n\nFlight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday.\n\nJetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThis is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nEmmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris.\n\nHowever, it appears he left before Trump's speech.\n\nEven the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. \"Those beautiful sunglasses,\" Trump said. \"What the hell happened?\"\n\nMacron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem.\n\nA Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed.\n\nIt costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter.\n\nMore popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet.\n\nTrump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner.\n\nHowever, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it.\n\nThis week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One.\n\nHis press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force.\n\nThe Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year.\n\nHe flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday.\n\nCarney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" he said.\n\nThe above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "When Modestas Bukauskas was 19, he was staring at wires coming out of his body and trying not to look as doctors operated on his heart.\n\nThe fledging athlete would be awake throughout surgery that lasted almost five hours. He had been experiencing heart palpitations since childhood, and they were only worsening as his athletic career blossomed.\n\nMany could have lived with the condition, but Bukauskas was not just anyone.\n\nHe was a kid who wanted to make his Lithuanian father proud and become a UFC fighter.\n\nAnd here he was having the operation he hoped would make that possible.\n\n\"It was pretty brutal,\" Bukauskas tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"I was awake the whole time. They literally had wires going up my groin into my heart and they were trying to induce palpitations.\n\n\"Then they had to basically burn off an external circuit in my heart to basically fix my heart.\"\n\nThe experience fortified Bukauskas. He would push himself to the limit in training, and a two-year spell playing basketball in Louisiana resulted in him being on the verge of fainting during sessions in 40-degree Celsius heat.\n\nHe was already a British kickboxing champion by the time he had the heart operation, with the palpitations having had him worried.\n\n\"It was very dangerous. I was lucky it never happened in any of my kickboxing fights,\" says Bukauskas.\n\n\"But I think that was a little starting point as to all the hardships I'd have to go through.\n\n\"That was the first steps to being able to overcome anything else that came later on in life.\"\n\nNow aged 31, Bukauskas faces the most important fight of his sporting life when he takes on Nikita Krylov on Saturday evening at UFC 324.",

    "title": "Genetic Data from over 20k U.S. Children Misused for 'Race Science'",
    "description": "The National Institutes of Health failed to protect brain scans that an international group of fringe researchers used to argue for the intellectual superiority of white people.",
    "fullText": "Genetic researchers were seeking children for an ambitious, federally funded project to track brain development — a study that they told families could yield invaluable discoveries about DNA’s impact on behavior and disease.\n\nThey also promised that the children’s sensitive data would be closely guarded in the decade-long study, which got underway in 2015. Promotional materials included a cartoon of a Black child saying it felt good knowing that “scientists are taking steps to keep my information safe.”\n\nThe scientists did not keep it safe.\n\nA group of fringe researchers thwarted safeguards at the National Institutes of Health and gained access to data from thousands of children. The researchers have used it to produce at least 16 papers purporting to find biological evidence for differences in intelligence between races, ranking ethnicities by I.Q. scores and suggesting Black people earn less because they are not very smart.\n\nMainstream geneticists have rejected their work as biased and unscientific. Yet by relying on genetic and other personal data from the prominent project, known as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, the researchers gave their theories an air of analytical rigor.\n\nMembers of the research group were ineligible to obtain data from the ABCD project. But one of them gained access through an American professor who was already being investigated by the N.I.H. over his handling of another child brain study.\n\nTheir papers have provided fodder for racist posts on social media and white nationalist message boards that have been viewed millions of times. Some of the papers are cited by A.I. bots like ChatGPT and Grok in response to queries about race and intelligence. On the social media platform X, Grok has referred users to the research more than two dozen times this month alone.\n\n“It’s evil,” said Dr. Terry L. Jernigan, national co-director of the ABCD Study and a neuropsychologist at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s not just that the science is faulty, but it’s being used to advance an unethical agenda.”\n\nThe misuse of the children’s data has validated longstanding concerns that hundreds of thousands of Americans’ genetic information held by the N.I.H. could fall into the wrong hands. The agency grants widespread access to stimulate new medical discoveries. But critics say the N.I.H. has failed to address the risks that the data, even with personally identifiable details removed, could be misused in unethical research, for commercial purposes or by foreign adversaries.\n\nAt least 63 times since 2007, data from some of the 28 human genomic repositories that the N.I.H. controls was improperly released to researchers, used for unapproved purposes or made vulnerable to theft, according to government records reviewed by The New York Times. In dozens of cases, the N.I.H. suspended researchers’ access and demanded that compromised data be destroyed, but the agency relies heavily on good-faith pledges of compliance.\n\nThe misuse of the data for so-called race science is not the only example of a security failure involving the ABCD Study.\n\nThe Times learned that in 2024, the same data was improperly obtained by an unidentified researcher in China. The data is not allowed to be shared with people in adversarial countries that could use it for blackmail, spy recruitment or military purposes. But the researcher evaded that prohibition by faking an affiliation with an American university, according to a former N.I.H. official and Dr. Jernigan, who said the agency informed her of the incident.\n\nThere has been no official public accounting of how the N.I.H. lost control of the children’s genetic information. The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2022 reported on the mishandling of data from another child brain study by the same American professor, Bryan J. Pesta, who also obtained the ABCD information. But details about the subsequent loss and abuse of the ABCD data have not been previously reported.\n\nToday, the data continues to be twisted to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nWhen Elon Musk invited X users last June to post politically incorrect “divisive facts” on the social network, one of Dr. Pesta’s collaborators — Jordan Lasker, who often writes about race and intelligence under the name Crémieux — replied with a criticism of affirmative action and said white people had bigger brains than Black people. The post, viewed 670,000 times, included a chart that purported to support his claim about brain size and cited the ABCD Study as its data source.\n\nThe conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza said on X in 2023 that studies showed that Black people, “who are the rock-solid base of the Democratic Party, have the lowest IQ of any ethnic group.” As evidence, he reposted another chart by Mr. Lasker based on ABCD data about American 10-year-olds.\n\nScientists said the unauthorized use of the data underscored the need for stronger controls. Several families in the ABCD Study said in interviews that they were not told about the misuse of the information and never would have agreed to participate had they known it could be used to promote racial division.\n\nKevin Bird, a geneticist who complained to the N.I.H. about Dr. Pesta, said the data was made vulnerable because “our scientific institutions sort of assume good faith in people.”\n\n“There needs to be an acknowledgment that there are bad-faith researchers,” he said. “The rules and regulations need to catch up with that.”\n\nIn a statement, Lyric Jorgenson, associate director of science policy at the N.I.H., said the agency had taken steps to protect the ABCD Study. It has introduced a new online portal requiring users to complete training on responsible data use and to “pass a knowledge test prior to accessing the data.”\n\nIn response to the fraudulent access by a Chinese researcher, she said, the N.I.H. “made enhancements that will prevent this type of incident” from happening again.\n\n“N.I.H. has a longstanding commitment to make the results of N.I.H.-funded research available,” she said, noting that it has approved more than 92,000 access requests since 2007. “At the same time, N.I.H. takes the protection of all human data very seriously and has numerous safeguards in place.”\n\nBut the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, reported last April that the N.I.H. did not have the resources to properly monitor all the downloads of genetic data and “may be missing violations that go unreported by researchers.”\n\nThe data that Dr. Pesta obtained came from two studies. In the nationwide ABCD Study, more than 11,000 children underwent regular M.R.I.s and clinical tests and had DNA samples taken from their blood or saliva. In a separate study, known as the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania collected similar information from about 9,500 children.\n\nData from the projects has generated hundreds of papers on, among other things, the effects of social media on mental health, genetic links to addiction and the causes of sleep disorders.\n\nThe data is maintained by the N.I.H. To gain access, researchers must be tenure-track professors or senior scientists with authorization from their institutions. They also must detail what they plan to do with the information. The N.I.H. can reject proposals that fall outside its guidelines.\n\nThe agency discourages “stigmatizing research” that could promote “negative stereotypes” or cause “social detriment.” That is, in part, a nod to eugenics, a discredited field of research asserting that certain races, usually white Europeans, are genetically superior. Such ideas — and the pseudoscientific studies that support them — have been used to justify violence, including by the gunman who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo in 2022.\n\nIn April 2018, Dr. Pesta, who at the time was a management professor at Cleveland State University, submitted a proposal to the N.I.H. He said he was researching differences in brain size and cognitive abilities in men and women and wanted access to data from the Philadelphia study.\n\nEmails unearthed in a lawsuit that Dr. Pesta later brought against the university show that he had been working with a group of race researchers who coached him on how to apply for access. One of them was John G.R. Fuerst, a graduate student from North Carolina. In a March 2018 email, he told Dr. Pesta that focusing on gender differences would be “a sneaky way” to get the data to also study disparities in intelligence between races — a topic the group believed the N.I.H. would not greenlight.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nThough Dr. Pesta later submitted updates on further research he wanted to do, none explicitly described the group’s true intentions, according to court records. The legal filings also show that another group member, Emil O.W. Kirkegaard, a right-wing blogger in Denmark, suggested Dr. Pesta submit misleading proposals to gain access to additional data sets.\n\n“I reckon that if we mask the nature of the study with usual medical terms, one can ‘get away with’ a lot,” Mr. Kirkegaard wrote in an email. “Getting samples for analyses that one doesn’t publish (to preserve your reputation!) are still useful because they allow us to validate our beliefs privately.”\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Pesta denied misleading the N.I.H. and defended his work. “I am not a eugenicist,” he said.\n\nDr. Pesta’s collaborators had a history of scrounging for data to support their fringe theories and of using unreliable methodologies.\n\nIn a 2023 paper, Mr. Fuerst tried to rank the intelligence of children across ethnic groups. But the sample size for the vast majority of groups was far too small to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\nEthnic/National group N ▼ Black African 59 Asian Indian 53 Other Asian 52 Black Caribbean 51 Filipino 51 N. Africa & Mid. East 47 White & Asian Indian 44 Native American 39 Dominican 38 Korean & Japanese 33 Other Cuban 30 White & Pacific Islander 25 Vietnamese 24 Pacific Islander 17\n\nThe paper also invented a category, “USA Black,” excluding Black children with Hispanic or white heritage and an immigrant parent or grandparent. Furthermore, the race of participants was self-reported, a potentially inconsistent gauge of ancestry.\n\nEthnic/National group Definition Pacific Islander not Hispanic & not White & Pacific Islander USA Black not Hispanic & not White & Black & non-immigrant family Vietnamese not Hispanic & not White & Vietnamese\n\nMr. Kirkegaard has published dozens of pieces in Mankind Quarterly, a journal known for pushing race science. He has studied penis sizes by race and once looked for correlations between intelligence and first names, concluding that people with “non-western Muslim names” had lower I.Q.s. Authorities in Britain blocked Mr. Kirkegaard and his European colleagues from the country’s repository of genetic data because they were “not bona fide researchers,” The Guardian reported in 2024.\n\nAnother member of Dr. Pesta’s group was Mr. Lasker, whose frequent posts online mix data analysis with ideological barbs. He dismissed Supreme Court Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor as “clearly incompetent” affirmative-action hires. (During the campaign for New York City mayor, Mr. Lasker also shared hacked data with The Times showing that Zohran Mamdani had identified as “Black or African American” on a college application.)\n\nTo finance their research, Dr. Pesta and Mr. Fuerst, the North Carolina graduate student, set up a foundation that received tens of thousands of dollars from the Pioneer Fund, which has a history of promoting eugenics-related research and race science. The fund’s president at the time once wrote approvingly about the idea of “phasing out” incompetent cultures by withholding foreign aid and banning migrants “of low genetic quality.”\n\nThe N.I.H. approved Dr. Pesta’s access to the Philadelphia data, which he and Mr. Fuerst analyzed on a computer in Dr. Pesta’s home, according to a transcript of his interview with university investigators. Dr. Pesta also told them that he had uploaded the data, without N.I.H. approval, to a foreign DNA lab to try to determine the skin color of children in the study.\n\nIn August 2019, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker produced an analysis of the Philadelphia data. Their paper — which appeared in Psych, an online journal that Dr. Pesta edited — had nothing to do with gender differences and brain size, the topic for which Dr. Pesta had initially obtained the data. Instead, it declared that among people of mixed race, those with greater European ancestry were more intelligent, and that genes were probably the reason.\n\n“These results provide support for a hereditarian model,” they wrote.\n\nThe “hereditarian model” is the belief that intelligence is largely inherited and not a result of environmental factors. Race science broadens the theory across ancestral groups, asserting that people with a European background tend to perform better than African Americans on I.Q. tests because they are innately smarter, a view embraced by white supremacists.\n\nThis runs counter to the scientific consensus that any correlation between a complex trait like intelligence and genes, let alone social constructs like race, is not the same as causation.\n\nResearch has found that the environment in which people are raised can affect their cognitive abilities. In the United States, for example, any serious analysis must consider how Black people endured centuries of slavery and racial discrimination and how they today face disproportionately high poverty rates and a lack of quality education and health care.\n\nBut Dr. Pesta and his colleagues did not focus on that.\n\nThe authors of this paper admitted that the only socioeconomic information available in the Philadelphia data was the education levels of the children’s parents. Their study didn't consider factors like family income and employment that can affect racial I.Q. gaps.\n\n2.2. Parental Socioeconomic Status\n\nOnly paternal and maternal education were available to us as measures of SES. We coded parental education as the average of each, both z-scored first. When data were only available from one parent this value was used. The final score was then z-scored again.\n\nThe Philadelphia data did not include information on skin, eye or hair color of the children, so Dr. Pesta tried to predict those traits by uploading the genetic data to an unapproved, foreign DNA lab — contributing to sanctions against him from the N.I.H.\n\n2.5. Skin, Hair, and Eye Color\n\nThe data did not include measures of appearance, so we opted to impute these based on genotypes. We used the HIrisPlex-S web application to do this. This application was developed by the U.S. Department of Justice for use in forensic investigations. It imputes skin, hair, and eye color probabilities with a high degree of accuracy based on 41 SNPs (with overlapping variants; 6 for eye color, 22 for hair color, and 36 for skin color).\n\nDr. Pesta said in the interview that his research was scientifically sound and intended to improve the lives of Black people by determining the cause of I.Q. gaps. Because “I.Q. test scores strongly predict human well-being, and African Americans are on the short end of every well-being stick, I think it’s an important problem,” he said.\n\nMr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTheir 2019 paper caused a commotion, with scientists criticizing it for discounting possible nongenetic explanations for the I.Q. gap. Alexander Gusev, a geneticist at Harvard University who has written about the “weaponization of genomic data,” said such an approach was “playacting at doing science.”\n\n“The goal seems to be just to dig through the data and find something that matches a hypothesis about some difference in African Americans versus whites, and then report it without seriously considering any possible caveats,” he said.\n\nDr. Hakon Hakonarson, a geneticist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, was the co-leader of the study whose data Dr. Pesta used. When the N.I.H. informed him of Dr. Pesta’s paper, Dr. Hakonarson was outraged, saying its conclusions were not supported by the underlying data.\n\n“It’s most unfortunate that the data you submit in good faith gets abused in this sort of way,” Dr. Hakonarson said.\n\nIn September 2019, a month after the paper’s publication, the N.I.H. ordered Dr. Pesta to “immediately cease all work” with the Philadelphia data and began an investigation into his use of it. But about a year later, while the agency was still investigating, it approved Dr. Pesta’s request for the ABCD data. (The N.I.H. did not respond to a question about why.)\n\nIn 2021, before Dr. Pesta published anything based on the ABCD Study, the N.I.H. accused him of misconduct with the Philadelphia data and suspended his access to its repositories for three years. It was the most severe penalty the agency had ever issued. Cleveland State fired him the following year.\n\nDr. Pesta told university investigators that he had destroyed the data as instructed by the N.I.H., but he could not say for certain whether Mr. Fuerst had made a copy from the computer in Dr. Pesta’s home. He said he had distanced himself from Mr. Fuerst, who had “gone a little bit rogue.”\n\nMr. Fuerst and his colleagues have continued to cite the ABCD data. In 2024, for example, they published a book that compiled many of their papers and mentioned the ABCD Study about 200 times. Mr. Fuerst’s co-authors have included other people ineligible to access the data, such as a professor at a state university in Russia and a freelance researcher in China who has publicly acknowledged having “no formal credentials” in intelligence research.\n\nThe papers provide fuel for more forays into race science. Invoking their own previous analyses of the child brain studies, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Fuerst have produced new papers suggesting that Black people earn less than white people because they are less intelligent.\n\nOne of those papers, in turn, was cited in a Substack article last April asserting that Black people’s supposed lack of intelligence was the source of the racial income gap. The article was picked up by an online magazine with tens of thousands of viewers.\n\nAnother paper, coauthored by Mr. Kirkegaard, was limited by what he acknowledged were small sample sizes and a lack of nongenetic data. Those shortcomings did not stop him from trumpeting the findings online as proof that “genetic ancestry, not social race, explains observed gaps in social status.”\n\nThe scientists leading the ABCD Study decided not to tell participants that their data had been misused for race research.\n\nParents and their children — who are now adults nearing the end of the decade-long study — reacted with surprise and dismay when The Times told them what had happened. They said they deserved to learn about it from the study’s organizers.\n\nScientists said they chose not to inform the families because they believed doing so could cause more harm than good.\n\n“We have struggled with the decision,” said Angela Laird at Florida International University, who helps run the ABCD Study in South Florida.\n\nMany of her study participants are Black and Hispanic and “are really the targets of these racist studies,” Dr. Laird said. “I do believe that if we sat our families down and read them the studies, they would be upset — and in many cases, that is likely an understatement.”\n\nThe organizers of the Philadelphia study didn’t tell families, either. Dr. Hakonarson said that because children’s identities weren’t disclosed, informing parents “was not something that was felt to be needed.”\n\nWhile some scientists have pushed the N.I.H. to limit how sensitive genetic data can be used in research, there is little indication the Trump administration agrees — and there are signs it is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nAdam Candeub, the top lawyer at the Federal Communications Commission, wrote a law review article in 2024 criticizing the N.I.H.’s discouragement of stigmatizing research. He compared it to the persecution of Galileo.\n\n“A liberal society should support the search for truth,” Mr. Candeub wrote, “regardless of how uncomfortable and unsettling that truth turns out to be.”\n\nDr. Pesta has claimed that he faced such persecution. He sued Cleveland State for wrongful termination, saying he was a victim of cancel culture. A federal judge dismissed his lawsuit. He ruled that Dr. Pesta was fired “because of his own misconduct” with the restricted data, not the content of his research. A federal appeals court affirmed the decision in November.\n\nStill, Dr. Pesta and his fellow race researchers have reason for optimism. The pendulum of public policy, Dr. Pesta said, “is swinging in terms of acceptance of even asking the questions.”\n\nA few days after President Trump won the 2024 election, Mr. Kirkegaard happily noted on his website that incoming Vice President JD Vance followed compatriots like Mr. Lasker on social media. His post featured an image of a red “Make Science Great Again” hat.\n\nWithin weeks of Mr. Trump taking office, the N.I.H. made a little-noticed revision to the guidelines on access to a large genetic database. Its description of what constituted stigmatizing research no longer included any reference to skin color, ancestry and ethnicity.\n\nProduced by Tina Zhou and Rumsey Taylor.",

The sheer volume of calls forces to rely on low-quality outsourced call centers or have their internal teams waste hours on repetitive calls.\n\nWith telli, our customers now rely on AI voice agents that handle their repetitive calls, freeing human to focus on what matters - talking to customers when it counts. The result: higher efficiency, happier teams, and better customer experiences.\n\nLegacy phone systems weren’t designed for an AI-first world. That is why we are building the first AI-native phone system that lets companies manage both their human and AI teams on one platform.\n\nOur founding team knows this problem inside-out. We ran a 150-person internal call center at Enpal. We know how difficult and expensive it is to scale high-quality customer experience with phone calls.\n\nThe opportunity is massive!!! and we're just getting started. We're on a mission to let every company provide a world-class customer experience by ending the era of low-quality call centers.\n\nKnow someone great?

    "description": "The partnership with the tech giant speaks to a push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind",
    "fullText": "Partnership with tech giant speaks to push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind\n\nIn this World Cup year, Fifa has come out of the blocks quickly. In the past few weeks any number of initiatives have been announced or activated, from a data partnership with Opta to facilitate more betting, to the Fifa Pass for speeding up visa applications for the US this summer, to the unveiling of the official Lego World Cup trophy. Among the ever-expanding list is an intriguing deal with TikTok, a partnership that will give digital creators front-row seats at the 104-match tournament.\n\nIn Fifa language its partnership with the short-form video platform will make “the most inclusive event in football history … even more accessible”. According to TikTok’s global head of content, James Stafford, it will bring fans “closer to the action in ways they can’t get anywhere else”. It plans to do so by granting an unspecified number of online personalities behind-the-scenes access, giving them archive and highlights footage to use in their content and, in return, requesting an avalanche of posts that will make the World Cup inescapable for TikTok users.\n\nIn choosing TikTok as its preferred platform Fifa is catching up with the times. The use of creators, also known as influencers, is increasingly essential for any consumer business. The NFL has integrated creators (quick definition: online personalities who make their living from posting on social media) into coverage of the Super Bowl since the turn of the decade. But the full possibilities of the creator economy are only beginning to be explored by sports organisations.\n\nLast summer the streaming company Dazn built its own creator network for Fifa’s Club World Cup. It enlisted as many as 50 creators to post videos that built excitement around the event, be they behind-the-scenes tours, interviews with players and coaches or stunts such as racing to see who could make it to the Chelsea v Palmeiras game on time.\n\n“It was a new tournament and we wanted to hit every lever we possibly could to generate awareness in as many places as possible, particularly with a younger audience,” says Joe Caporoso, the president of Team Whistle, a Dazn-owned company that specialises in digital strategy. “We searched through people who had strong organic followings on places like Instagram and TikTok, and who had a history of a high volume of posting consistency around not just the sport of soccer, but also the culture of it. We wanted to make sure we had people and creators who spoke authentically and were not shy about showing everything that goes on around the game.”\n\nFrom there, Caporoso’s team laid out a campaign that defined the amount of content creators were expected to generate. A group of editors and content programmers made sure each post was optimised for maximum exposure and liaised with creators to make sure no potential talking point or key moment was missed. Dazn and Whistle tracked the performance of each post, monitored the traffic that went back to Dazn’s coverage, and discussed the outcomes with TikTok.\n\nThis is a degree of oversight materially higher than that of, say, the BBC over Gary Lineker at the last European Championship. It gives a clue to one reason why creators are coming to the fore in sports coverage. Not only are they generally younger, part of a demographic sports leaders are anxious to attract, not only are they trusted by their audience due to a perceived authenticity, but creators are comfortable working in a media environment where the demands of the client come first. Their productivity can be off the charts. They perform, they shoot, they edit, they strike promotional deals, they post regularly and often. They are, in Caporoso’s words, “one-person companies”.\n\nTikTok says the Club World Cup creator platform drove more than 500,000 fans to Dazn’s service and that 90% of fans take “at least one off-platform action” after viewing sports content on their app. Fifa says its creator platform is designed for similar purposes, such as directing new viewers to its match coverage, but it could perform other functions too. It could be a new revenue stream, for example, with Fifa taking a cut from the advertising revenue generated on TikTok through the deal. It could be a way of expanding the reach of sponsorship deals Fifa has elsewhere. It establishes a relationship with a tech giant who may yet be tempted into paying for broadcast rights more broadly. Finally, the new platform could also provide a means for shaping the way the World Cup is talked about.\n\nInstead of allowing the post-match debate or attention between matchdays to be channeled by media companies, a creator platform deal keeps sports organisers in the conversation. “It’s a way for them to become a partner and to have their say, a bit of their say, in how their material is presented on second screens,” says François Godard of the media research company Enders Analysis. Creators offer the possibility of drumming up enthusiasm should interest begin to wane, but also keeping discussion away from topics that might be problematic. When Dazn secured an interview with Donald Trump before the Club World Cup final, it asked Emily Austin, from its roster of creators, to conduct it. A Maga enthusiast and marketer of Trump Derangement Syndrome merchandise, she flattered the US president and Fifa while celebrating the success of the tournament.\n\nCreators present an efficient and effective way of reaching audiences with a defined message. Godard, however, is sceptical of how useful they might be in driving audience growth for sport. “In our data, we see that the viewership of traditional TV by the 16-to-34 age group has collapsed over the past 10 years, but not in sports,” he says. “That’s because sports is unique. It’s live, and there’s no alternative.”\n\nReports in the US have suggested the picture is complicated somewhat by traditional broadcasters having acquired the rights Fifa wants to share with influencers. According to the publication Puck, TikTok would need a sublicensing deal with the broadcaster Fox, an arrangement yet to be struck. In the UK the BBC and ITV jointly hold rights to linear and digital broadcasts. The BBC said it would not comment on rights negotiations.\n\nGodard believes that instead the platform is a play to develop new places where Fifa may ultimately sell its rights, even as it extends the offering on its Fifa+ broadcast platform (thanks to a new deal with Dazn). Whatever the outcome, it may be just that creators have the power to disrupt the media environment that has made Fifa decide to embrace them.",

    "description": "Connecting Claude to Ghidra via MCP to reverse engineer River Raid. A test of AI agents against 6502 assembly, memory mapping, and 80s game logic.",
    "fullText": "Can an AI agent navigate Ghidra, the NSA’s open-source reverse engineering suite, well enough to hack an Atari game? Ghidra is powerful but notoriously complex, with a steep learning curve. Instead of spending weeks learning its interface, what if I could simply describe my goal and let an AI handle the complexity?\n\nRiver Raid, the Atari 8-bit version. My first computer was an Atari back in the 80s, and this particular game occupied a disproportionate amount of my childhood attention.\n\nThe ROM is exactly 8kB — almost comical by modern standards. And yet this tiny binary contains everything: graphics, sound, enemy AI, and physics simulation — all compressed into hand-optimized 6502 assembly.\n\nThe objective was straightforward: unlimited lives. It’s the quintessential hack, a rite of passage that kids with hex editors performed for entertainment back in the 80s. In 2025, instead of a hex editor, I have an AI.\n\nGhidra doesn’t have a native AI assistant, so I needed a way to bridge the gap between my instructions and the tool’s internal API. This is where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes in.\n\nI found an open-source MCP server for Ghidra — essentially a connector that allows Claude to talk directly to Ghidra. The concept is elegant: Claude connects to the running Ghidra instance, analyzes the binary, renames functions, and identifies code patterns programmatically.\n\nIn practice, the experience was considerably less elegant:\n\nHere’s the thing: I don’t use disassemblers daily. Ghidra’s workflow was completely foreign to me. The whole point was to see if AI could bridge that gap — I’d feed it a mysterious binary, and the Ghidra + LLM combination would figure out it’s a cartridge dump, handle the memory mapping, and guide me through.\n\nReality was harsher. To test the AI properly, I renamed the binary to a.rom — no helpful filename hints. When importing, I selected only the CPU architecture (6502) without specifying the platform. Claude’s first instinct was reasonable: it asked for the MD5 hash to search for known ROM signatures. The MCP tools don’t expose hashing, so that avenue closed immediately.\n\nFirst problem: Ghidra loaded the ROM at $0000, not $A000 where Atari cartridges live. All cross-references pointed nowhere.\n\nClaude identified the issue with admirable clarity: “The ROM should be loaded at $A000, not $0000. You’ll need to rebase the memory image.”\n\nMe: “Can you perform the rebase?”\n\nClaude: “Unfortunately, no. The MCP tools don’t have write access for that particular operation.”\n\nI rebased manually to $8000 — still wrong. The code referenced $A000-$BFFF. Rebased again.\n\nTwo rebasing operations in total, neither of which the AI could perform.\n\nWhere Claude genuinely excelled was in identifying the target platform through hardware register analysis:\n\nHardware addresses are essentially fingerprints that can’t be faked, and these particular addresses are unmistakably Atari 8-bit.\n\nI asked Claude to attempt identification of the game based purely on code patterns and structural analysis. It examined the evidence methodically. Based on this evidence, Claude reached its conclusion:\n\nIt was, of course, not Centipede. It was River Raid.\n\nThis serves as a useful reminder that confidence and accuracy are orthogonal properties.\n\nDespite the identity crisis, Claude still understood the code structure. Finding the lives decrement was straightforward. Claude searched for the canonical pattern: load, decrement, store.\n\nThe fix is elegantly simple: replace DEY (decrement Y register) with NOP (no operation). A single byte modification, where $88 becomes $EA.\n\nSince the MCP tool couldn’t write the binary directly, I applied the patch externally:\n\nI tested the patched ROM in an emulator by deliberately crashing into a bridge. The lives counter remained stubbornly fixed at 3.\n\nClaude excelled at pattern recognition — hardware registers, code flow, finding the patch location. It struggled with tasks requiring broader context, such as identifying the game or analyzing sprite data.\n\nSetting up MCP is a troubleshooting ritual. It eventually worked, but the experience was painfully slow. Claude would fire off a batch of tool calls, some taking 30 seconds each. Too slow for an interactive session — I’d rather have quick responses with clarifying questions than watch a progress bar crawl. We need a better balance between autonomous batch processing and interactive guidance.\n\nAI should be embedded in every complex GUI tool. We’re in the experimental phase now. Some things work, some don’t. Ideally AI should smooth out the experience in ways traditional help systems never could — compacted Stack Overflow knowledge, real context-aware assistance, and the ability to actually perform tasks rather than just describe them.\n\nStay tuned for future posts and releases",

    "description": "Researchers have long have puzzled over why it’s so hard to break a piece of dry spaghetti into only two pieces. A new MIT study follows up on the musings of physicist Richard Feynman, showing how and why it can be done.",
    "fullText": "If you happen to have a box of spaghetti in your pantry, try this experiment: Pull out a single spaghetti stick and hold it at both ends. Now bend it until it breaks. How many fragments did you make? If the answer is three or more, pull out another stick and try again. Can you break the noodle in two? If not, you’re in very good company.\n\nThe spaghetti challenge has flummoxed even the likes of famed physicist Richard Feynman ’39, who once spent a good portion of an evening breaking pasta and looking for a theoretical explanation for why the sticks refused to snap in two.\n\nFeynman’s kitchen experiment remained unresolved until 2005, when physicists from France pieced together a theory to describe the forces at work when spaghetti — and any long, thin rod — is bent. They found that when a stick is bent evenly from both ends, it will break near the center, where it is most curved. This initial break triggers a “snap-back” effect and a bending wave, or vibration, that further fractures the stick. Their theory, which won the 2006 Ig Nobel Prize, seemed to solve Feynman’s puzzle. But a question remained: Could spaghetti ever be coerced to break in two?\n\nThe answer, according to a new MIT study, is yes — with a twist. In a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers report that they have found a way to break spaghetti in two, by both bending and twisting the dry noodles. They carried out experiments with hundreds of spaghetti sticks, bending and twisting them with an apparatus they built specifically for the task. The team found that if a stick is twisted past a certain critical degree, then slowly bent in half, it will, against all odds, break in two.\n\nThe researchers say the results may have applications beyond culinary curiosities, such as enhancing the understanding of crack formation and how to control fractures in other rod-like materials such as multifiber structures, engineered nanotubes, or even microtubules in cells.\n\n“It will be interesting to see whether and how twist could similarly be used to control the fracture dynamics of two-dimensional and three-dimensional materials,” says co-author Jörn Dunkel, associate professor of physical applied mathematics at MIT. “In any case, this has been a fun interdisciplinary project started and carried out by two brilliant and persistent students — who probably don’t want to see, break, or eat spaghetti for a while.”\n\nThe two students are Ronald Heisser ’16, now a graduate student at Cornell University, and Vishal Patil, a mathematics graduate student in Dunkel’s group at MIT. Their co-authors are Norbert Stoop, instructor of mathematics at MIT, and Emmanuel Villermaux of Université Aix Marseille.\n\nExperiments (above) and simulations (below) show how dry spaghetti can be broken into two or more fragments, by twisting and bending.\n\nHeisser, together with project partner Edgar Gridello, originally took up the challenge of breaking spaghetti in the spring of 2015, as a final project for 18.354 (Nonlinear Dynamics: Continuum Systems), a course taught by Dunkel. They had read about Feynman’s kitchen experiment, and wondered whether spaghetti could somehow be broken in two and whether this split could be controlled.\n\n“They did some manual tests, tried various things, and came up with an idea that when he twisted the spaghetti really hard and brought the ends together, it seemed to work and it broke into two pieces,” Dunkel says. “But you have to twist really strongly. And Ronald wanted to investigate more deeply.”\n\nSo Heisser built a mechanical fracture device to controllably twist and bend sticks of spaghetti. Two clamps on either end of the device hold a stick of spaghetti in place. A clamp at one end can be rotated to twist the dry noodle by various degrees, while the other clamp slides toward the twisting clamp to bring the two ends of the spaghetti together, bending the stick.\n\nHeisser and Patil used the device to bend and twist hundreds of spaghetti sticks, and recorded the entire fragmentation process with a camera, at up to a million frames per second. In the end, they found that by first twisting the spaghetti at almost 360 degrees, then slowly bringing the two clamps together to bend it, the stick snapped exactly in two. The findings were consistent across two types of spaghetti: Barilla No. 5 and Barilla No. 7, which have slightly different diameters.\n\nExperiments (above) and simulations (below) show how dry spaghetti can be broken into two or more fragments, by twisting and bending.\n\nIn parallel, Patil began to develop a mathematical model to explain how twisting can snap a stick in two. To do this, he generalized previous work by the French scientists Basile Audoly and Sebastien Neukirch, who developed the original theory to describe the “snap-back effect,” in which a secondary wave caused by a stick’s initial break creates additional fractures, causing spaghetti to mostly snap in three or more fragments.\n\nPatil adapted this theory by adding the element of twisting, and looked at how twist should affect any forces and waves propagating through a stick as it is bent. From his model, he found that, if a 10-inch-long spaghetti stick is first twisted by about 270 degrees and then bent, it will snap in two, mainly due to two effects. The snap-back, in which the stick will spring back in the opposite direction from which it was bent, is weakened in the presence of twist. And, the twist-back, where the stick will essentially unwind to its original straightened configuration, releases energy from the rod, preventing additional fractures.\n\n“Once it breaks, you still have a snap-back because the rod wants to be straight,” Dunkel explains. “But it also doesn’t want to be twisted.”\n\nJust as the snap-back will create a bending wave, in which the stick will wobble back and forth, the unwinding generates a “twist wave,” where the stick essentially corkscrews back and forth until it comes to rest. The twist wave travels faster than the bending wave, dissipating energy so that additional critical stress accumulations, which might cause subsequent fractures, do not occur.\n\n“That’s why you never get this second break when you twist hard enough,” Dunkel says.\n\nThe team found that the theoretical predictions of when a thin stick would snap in two pieces, versus three or four, matched with their experimental observations.\n\n“Taken together, our experiments and theoretical results advance the general understanding of how twist affects fracture cascades,” Dunkel says.\n\nFor now, he says the model is successful at predicting how twisting and bending will break long, thin, cylindrical rods such as spaghetti. As for other pasta types?\n\n“Linguini is different because it’s more like a ribbon,” Dunkel says. “The way the model is constructed it applies to perfectly cylindrical rods. Although spaghetti isn’t perfect, the theory captures its fracture behavior pretty well,”\n\nThe research was supported, in part, by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the James S. McDonnell Foundation.",

    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - Russia launched another vast attack on Ukraine's energy system in the small hours of Saturday, rocking Kyiv with explosions throughout the night and leaving ​1.2 million properties without power countrywide.\n\nNearly 6,000 buildings in the capital were left without heating ‌on Saturday morning as temperatures hovered around -10 degrees Celsius (14 F). Many residents' apartments were already freezing cold from disruption to the ‌city's centralised heat distribution system following previous attacks.\n\nMoscow carried out the strikes as trilateral, U.S.-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine continued into a second day in the UAE, with no sign of compromise on Friday.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said one person was killed in the capital city and four injured, including three being treated ⁠in hospital, while 19 people including ‌a child were wounded in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.\n\nRussia, which has pummelled Ukraine's power grid since its full-scale invasion in 2022, is conducting its heaviest bombardment campaign ‍on energy facilities this winter, leaving people across Ukraine with only a few hours of power a day and some without heat or water.\n\nOver 800,000 people in the capital and another 400,000 in the northern region of Chernihiv ​were without power after the latest attacks, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nUkraine's air force said ‌Russia had unleashed 375 drones and 21 missiles, including two of its rarely deployed Tsirkon ballistic missiles, in its overnight attack.\n\nThe sky over Kyiv was lit up by regular orange flashes as air defences fired on missiles and drones descending on the capital, with loud booms echoing around the city's tall buildings.\n\nTymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, reported strikes in at least four districts. A medical facility was ⁠among the buildings damaged.\n\nBefore Saturday, Kyiv had already endured two ​mass overnight attacks since the New Year that have knocked ​out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings.\n\nEmergency workers were still engaged in restoring services to residents that had been knocked out by those attacks, and Klitschko said ‍many of the buildings ⁠that had lost heating on Saturday had only recently had it restored.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a frequent target 30 km (18 miles) from the Russian border and much closer to eastern battlefronts, Mayor Ihor ⁠Terekhov said 25 drones had hit several districts.\n\nWriting on Telegram, Terekhov said the drones had struck a dormitory for displaced people ‌and two medical facilities including a maternity hospital.",

If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. Prepare for possible power outages,\" the weather service warned.\n\nA winter weather advisory has been issued for the Great Smoky Mountains, where mixed precipitation of snow and sleet is expected.\n\nThe warning is in effect from 1 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 24, to 7 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 25.\n\n\"Power outages and tree damage are possible due to the ice. Travel will be hazardous. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches,\" the weather service warned.\n\nThe mountaintops have a high wind warning from 7 p.m. Saturday to 7 p.m. Sunday. Widespread power outages are expected.\n\nA winter storm watch indicates severe weather is on the way. The watch will be issued at least 24 hours before a storm that has a risk of being hazardous, according to the National Weather Service. The storm's occurrence, location or timing may be uncertain under a watch.\n\nA watch will normally be upgraded to either a warning or an advisory, depending on how a storm develops.\n\nA winter storm warning means that a storm is imminent. Warnings are issued for a significant winter weather event, including snow, ice, sleet or blowing snow ‒ or a combination of these hazards, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIf a winter storm warning is issued, it's best to stay off the roads.\n\nA winter storm advisory means the storm is happening, but the winter weather storm dangers are limited. Be prepared for winter driving conditions and possible travel difficulties. Use caution when driving.\n\nThere are things that you can do to prepare yourself, your car and your home for the upcoming winter weather.\n\nMake sure that you have food, extra water and warm clothes ahead of a storm in case the ice or snow causes a power outage, according to the Red Cross. It's also helpful to have a snow shovel and salt on hand for your driveway and sidewalks.\n\nAlso, consider filling up your car with gas before a snowstorm. Keep a blanket, an emergency kit and warm clothes in your car in case you get stuck on the side of the road, according to the Red Cross.\n\nThere's still much uncertainty about the details of the expected winter storm this weekend.

Corey is the brains. He gets things done,” a senior administration official told Axios.\n\nLast week, an Axios reporter spotted Lewandowski standing at a gate at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where he was apparently discussing DHS vendor contracts loudly on the phone. The former Trump campaign chief specifically mentioned data company Palantir as well as a drone program, according to the outlet.\n\nA DHS spokesperson told Axios that Palantir has had a contract with the U.S. government for 14 years but that Lewandowski had never worked with Palantir and was not involved in the company’s government contract.\n\nLast year, however, The Wall Street Journal reported that Lewandowski had arranged for Noem to meet with Palantir and had told DHS officials to give the company additional work. Weeks later, DHS updated an existing contract to give Palantir an additional $29.9 million.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Lewandowski and DHS for comment.\n\nAs a special government employee, Lewandowski is allowed to maintain all of his private business interests and does not have to file a public financial disclosure form.\n\nHe is still subject to federal conflict of interest laws, but he refuses to say how he makes money, according to Axios.\n\nHe also remains close to the president, having managed Trump’s presidential campaign for part of the 2016 election cycle and later serving as an adviser to the Trump 2024 team.\n\n“No one can really control Corey,” a senior official told Axios.",

    "fullText": "A hiker has been found dead after attempting to climb Mount Whitney in California despite their companion turning back\n\nAt around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, “while near the 12,500-foot elevation, one hiker determined it was safest to turn around and descend,\" per a release from a local search & rescue group, though the second hiker continued on and ultimately died\n\n“After a thorough search, the subject was located on the north face of Mount Whitney, below the “Final 400” on the Mountaineers Route, and was confirmed deceased,” officials said. They did not reveal the person's identity\n\nA hiker has been found dead after attempting to climb Mount Whitney in California despite their companion turning back.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jan. 21, the Inyo County Search & Rescue confirmed in a post on Facebook that they received a report about a missing hiker on Monday.\n\nOfficials said the individual began hiking with another person at around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday and into the next day.\n\nHowever, at around 3:30 p.m. local time on Sunday, “while near the 12,500-foot elevation, one hiker determined it was safest to turn around and descend.”\n\n“The second hiker continued ascending toward the summit,” the release read. “When the second hiker failed to return by the following morning, the reporting party contacted the Inyo County Sheriff’s Office, and a SAR response was initiated.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe rescue operation involved a team of six rescuers and the California Highway Patrol Inland Division helicopter (H-82), which departed from Lone Pine.\n\nWhen the helicopter arrived at Mount Whitney at around 2:00 p.m., a “rescuer was inserted with the flight crew to conduct an aerial search.”\n\n“After a thorough search, the subject was located on the north face of Mount Whitney, below the “Final 400” on the Mountaineers Route, and was confirmed deceased,” officials said. They did not reveal the person's identity.\n\nThe rescuers then returned to Lone Pine just before 6:00 p.m.\n\n“The incident occurred within Tulare County jurisdiction, and proper notification was made to the Tulare County Sheriff's Office,” Inyo County Search & Rescue continued.\n\nThe news comes after the body of a missing 21-year-old hiker was recovered on Mount Whitney, Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nPEOPLE also previously reported that a father of two died after falling from a trail while climbing Mount Whitney in October.\n\nIn their recent statement, the Inyo County Search & Rescue said the “recent fatalities on Mount Whitney and Mount Baldy, serves as a reminder that winter ascents are serious mountaineering endeavors, not hikes.”\n\n“Winter conditions leave little margin for error, and the consequences can be severe,” they added. “Additionally, many fatalities occur when individuals travel solo or when groups separate.”\n\nThey went on to say that the safety concerns of a person in a group “ should be taken seriously.”\n\n“Fatigue is also a critical contributing factor,” they added. “Extended periods of exertion negatively impact decision-making and increase the likelihood of missteps and falls. Knowing when to turn around can save lives.\"\n\nThe statement from rescuers concluded, “Please be respectful in your comments. The victim’s family and friends may be following this post, and some comments may be hurtful. Thank you!”\n\nMount Whitney is the tallest mountain in the contiguous U.S., according to the National Park Service’s website. The elevation at the summit is reported to be 14,505 feet.",

    "description": "You don't have to make a 30-year commitment to get into real estate.",
    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nGiven how much real estate prices have soared in America, many homeowners may be feeling richer than ever. But real estate mogul Grant Cardone says your house isn’t a smart investment — far from it.\n\nIn a January interview with podcaster Sean Kelly, Cardone said, “a house is not something that people should be buying. They should rent (1).”\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThat may seem ironic coming from someone known for investing in residential real estate. But it’s not the first time Cardone has tackled this issue, saying in a separate video on TikTok that buying a home “is a terrible investment (2).”\n\nHe was quick to explain why: “[A home] doesn’t [give] cash flow. You don't get big tax write-offs because of it. You have no leverage. You're living in it. You're paying for it. You never own it. Even when the loan is paid, you don't own it. You still got to pay property taxes, still got to insure, still got to maintain it.”\n\nWhen you buy a home to live in, it’s true that it won’t necessarily generate any cash flow. And even once the mortgage is paid off, there are still ongoing costs: property taxes, insurance premiums, repairs and maintenance. And they can add up fast.\n\nThe median monthly ownership costs for U.S. homeowners with a mortgage increased by around 4% from 2024 to 2025, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau (3). In a related press release, census data revealed that homeowners with a mortgage are spending more than 20% of their income on additional homeownership costs.\n\nCardone suggests a simple reason that these costs are ignored, alongside the downsides of homeownership.\n\n“People get emotional about their house — ‘It’s my house!’” he said. “It ain’t your house. You're a partner in this house with the state.”\n\nCardone’s suggestion is simple: “Never buy a house, rent where you live.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean he’s against real estate entirely.\n\n“I'm not saying ‘don't own real estate,’” he clarified. “I'm saying live in a house and pay rent. Take all the money that you would have spent on that house and invest in real estate that [has] cash flows — that pays you every month.”",

And we’re ready,” Mamdani wrote on X on Thursday afternoon as part of a post on the city’s prep for the storm.\n\nNYC is forecasted to get 3–16 inches of snow this weekend.

Citing numbers with a probability range of 5% to 95% is idiotic and moronic.”\n\n“Maybe they forgot the 1 in front of the 3?

    "fullText": "If there was one word to summarize the Phoenix Suns’ season, “unlucky” might just be it. That’s the theme of Jordan Ott’s post-game remarks too. In his first year as the Suns’ head coach, he’s not had a complete rotation because of injuries. After tonight’s 110-103 loss against the Hawks, Ott faces the prospect of his team being even more shorthanded of his explosive scorers, Devin Booker and Jalen Green.\n\nHe barely had Jalen Green back for a second game after a 33-game absence. He came off the bench for five minutes and had to limp back to the locker room. He was ruled out for the rest of the game.\n\nOtt had no update on his status after the game. “Just same with Jalen. Just felt a little tightness, just for precautionary reasons took him out. Didn’t come back…”\n\nThis was the last game on a six-game road trip for the Suns. Ott said that they plan to assess Green once they’re back in Phoenix. But that wasn’t all.\n\nOnce more, injuries decimated the Suns before the Hawks could. Even Devin Booker had an injury scare. After Green’s exit, Book had a run-in with Hawks forward Onyeka Okongwu. They got tied up and Booker was in pain on the floor.\n\nOtt said, “Obviously you saw what happened to Book, right ankle, rolled it on someone else’s foot. Pretty unlucky. So, we’ll just have to take a look when we get back to Phoenix.”\n\nFor now an update on Green and Booker are pending their return to Phoenix. But it’s not looking great for the team.\n\nThe post Suns HC Drops Concerning Devin Booker Injury Update After Phoenix Suffers Double Blow appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "The future of the Kansas City Chiefs’ new home stadium is in jeopardy after a recent committee meeting involving Kansas lawmakers. The Chiefs announced plans for a new $3 billion domed stadium in December, where they proposed public ownership of the arena, as a significant percentage of the funding would be secured through sales tax revenue (STAR) bonds.\n\nHence, when questions were raised about why the stadium wasn’t privately owned, Chiefs attorney Korb Maxwell issued a statement confirming that, without public ownership, the proposal wouldn’t make sense for the franchise.\n\n“If that (stadium) is not owned by a sports authority, if that is owned in private hands, then, if you would have $1.8 billion of STAR bonds come into that development, that would all be federally income taxed,” Maxwell said, as per the Kansas City Business Journal. “And so you would take, then, 45% of the dollars that came in and roughly ship that to Washington, D.C. … That would blow a huge hole in the budget for this project and, frankly, would not allow it to move forward.”\n\nAs explained by Korb Maxwell, private ownership would entail that the $1.8 billion in sales tax revenue (STAR) bonds could not be issued for the Chiefs’ stadium on a tax-exempt basis. This would lead to a massive hit on the franchise’s budget for the stadium and, hence, would push the Chiefs to move away from their proposed plan.\n\nThese questions about public ownership of the stadium stem from the possibility of what would happen if the Kansas City Chiefs, who will be taking care of the arena, decide to leave. Responding to these concerns, the Chiefs’ attorney reiterated the franchise’s long-term plans for the stadium.\n\n“We’re absolutely doing this and planning this as the long, long-term home for the Kansas City Chiefs for (multiple) generations,” Maxwell said, as per theKansas City Business Journal.\n\nWith this statement, the Chiefs seem adamant about securing public ownership for their new stadium, as they believe this venture will be prosperous for the state of Kansas.\n\nAs plans for the new Kansas City Chiefs stadium were unveiled, team owner Clark Hunt shared why this decision to move from Arrowhead was taken. In his statement, Hunt explained how this new project will significantly benefit the fans and the state of Kansas.\n\n“We made a decision as a family that this was the right opportunity and the best for the organization for several reasons,” Hunt said. “It’s about the fans. My dad [Lamar Hunt, who founded the franchise] was always about the fans and thinking about the future.”\n\n“This will give Chiefs Kingdom a state-of-the-art facility for multiple generations, a building that can last for at least 50 or 60 years. We believe it’s the best thing for the region. It will give Kansas City the opportunity to bid on events that we can’t host right now, like the Super Bowl, the College Football Playoff, and the NCAA Final Fours.”\n\nAs the Chiefs navigate the complex financing structure for their proposed $3 billion domed stadium, the franchise’s commitment to public ownership appears non-negotiable due to federal tax implications. Whether Kansas lawmakers will approve the necessary STAR bonds remains to be seen, but the Hunt family has made clear its vision extends generations into the future.\n\nThe post Chiefs Threaten Kansas Exit Over $3 Billion Dispute as Clark Hunt & Ownership Demand a ‘Landlord’ for New Stadium appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Another game, another win! The No. 1-ranked UConn Huskies rolled past the Georgetown Hoyas 83–42, tightening their grip on Big East play once again.",
    "fullText": "Another game, another win! The No. 1-ranked UConn Huskies rolled past the Georgetown Hoyas 83–42, tightening their grip on Big East play once again. But what caught everyone’s eye wasn’t the lopsided score; it was an in-game decision by head coach Geno Auriemma that offered a clear preview of how UConn will look in March.\n\nFor the first time in the Huskies’ conference play, Auriemma kept Azzi Fudd and Sarah Strong on the floor to begin the fourth quarter, despite UConn holding a comfortable lead. The Huskies immediately went on to respond with a 10–0 run, powered by four different scorers, erasing any thought of a late Georgetown push and turning the final period into another statement. But why the sudden change of heart?\n\nIn a post-game interview, the head coach explained that the move had far less to do with the Hoyas and everything to do with preparation.\n\n“Part of it is I’m trying to get them around the 30-minute mark every game,” Geno Auriemma said. “I just think if I don’t, I don’t think I’m being fair to them, and also getting them ready for the postseason as well. So that was number one. Number two, let them play themselves out. Shots weren’t going in for them. And you could see that they were getting a little bit frustrated, and I thought if I can just give them a couple more minutes to find their way out of it for a little bit, that’s mainly it. I mean, it still came down to 30-minutes even though they played in the fourth quarter a little bit.”\n\nAnd both of these players made sure to make the most of their presence on the court in the final quarter. Strong finished with a game-high 25 points as she continues her steady rise as a reliable scoring option. On the other hand, Fudd added another 19 points in what was her final collegiate appearance in front of a hometown crowd in Washington, D.C.\n\nHowever, the night didn’t start smoothly for Fudd. She missed her first seven attempts from beyond the arc as the Huskies opened just 1-for-13 from deep. But neither she nor Strong pressed. Once the Huskies found their rhythm, the two combined to flip the game entirely, each knocking down key shots as UConn closed the first half on a decisive run and carried a 51–20 lead into the break.\n\nAs the 2025–26 NCAA season moves forward, the Huskies are now at 20-0 overall and 10-0 in the Big East Conference. The only team that even came close to securing a win over them was the Michigan Wolverines, where they ended the game at 72-69. On the scoresheet, Sarah Strong leads the team on an individual level with the most points (19), most rebounds (8.3), most steals (3.7), and most blocks (1.6). However, when it comes to assists, KK Arnold holds that spot with 4.6 per game.\n\nAs a team, the Huskies offensively average 89.8 points per game, while holding their opponents to just 51 points.\n\nFor their next game, they will lock horns with the Seton Hall Pirates on January 24th. A game predicted to be in favor of the Huskies with 98.9% by ESPN. Following that, they will play against:\n\nThe Xavier Musketeers on January 28th.\n\nThe No. 17 Tennessee Lady Volunteers on February 1st.\n\nThe DePaul Blue Demons on February 4th.\n\nWith the stretch ahead gradually getting tougher, the UConn Huskies now enter the part of the season where, more than margins, what will matter is the habits they are building. And if the game against the Hoyas was any indication, trusting his core, extending minutes, and letting his best players work through discomfort rather than shielding them with the scoreboard will be the very approach Geno Auriemma will lean on in March.\n\nThe post Geno Auriemma’s Latest Azzi Fudd, Sarah Strong Decision Has March Written All Over It appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Here are nine nuggets for your weekend.",
    "fullText": "Welcome! Where are you, you ask. I'm calling this the Weekend 9. Think of it as a spot to warm up for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We'll have thoughts. We'll have tips. We'll have tweets. But just nine in all, though sometimes maybe more and sometimes maybe less. As for who I am? The paragraphs below tell some of the story. I can be reached at nick.piastowski@golf.com.\n\nIf you're reading this report, you're probably being encircled by snow, or the cold, or by pics from your pals in much calmer climates, so let's start with something warm and bright, such as this:\n\n\"Yeah, I love what I do. I love to play golf.\"\n\nThat's good. That was from Blades Brown, who's now three-fourths of the way through a  maybe-never-been-done-before playing attempt - and halfway home to something even more incredible. Here are your facts: On Sunday, he teed off at the the Bahamas Great Abaco Classic on the Korn Ferry Tour, where he's a member, then he played Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday - before heading to the PGA Tour's American Express, a tournament that runs Thursday through Sunday and invited Brown to play on a sponsor exemption. Add that all up, and you get this:\n\nBrown could play eight consecutive days of PGA Tour-level golf, and as far as anyone can tell, he'd be the first to do so.\n\nWhich, come Sunday night, might be just a cute trivia answer, because dude might win the thing. Please stay with us here.\n\nThe story starts 18 years ago, which is also when Brown did. Eighteen is Brown age, making him one of professional golf's youngest players - and there was natural curiosity when, a year ago, he started his pro career at the American Express on a sponsor exemption. How would the then-17-year-old play? How would he look away from the play? The first sentence of a story from Larry Bohannan, a writer from the nearby Palm Springs Desert Sun, summed it up this way:\n\nFor three days, Blades Brown was the story of The American Express, with the 17-year-old making birdies and thrilling galleries in his professional debut.\n\nBrown was personable. Ahead of the AmEx, he talked about dad and mom, who played in the WNBA and hit the league's first 3-pointer. He talked about wanting to dunk. Brown then opened with a 72, then shot a 64, which, according to GOLF.com contributor Justin Ray, was the lowest score in a PGA Tour round by a player under the age of 18 in the last 40 years. On his third day at the American Express - the event plays three rounds - Brown stumbled to a 74 and he missed the cut, but he hung around for interviews, including the one below, which was shown live on Golf Channel:\n\n\"Golf is a weird and funny game … but I'm going to keep my head up.\"\n\nDespite missing the cut, 17-year-old Blades Brown keeps a positive mindset after his first professional start @TheAmExGolf. pic.twitter.com/XhEpNiMvG2\n\n— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) January 18, 2025\n\nAfter all that, the folks at American Express invited him back. And the eight-day plan became a possibility. Brown earned the Korn Ferry spot through his full-time status on the tour (gained by finishing in the top 75 last year on the circuit's season-long points standings). He also picked up a ride between the Bahamas and the West Coast. Last May, he played in the PGA Tour's Myrtle Beach Classic, where he was given five hours of flight time by event sponsor and private jet company ONEFight by finishing in the top 50 - and he's cashed it in. His schedule between the tournaments looked like this:\n\n– Finished the final round at the Abaco Club on Wednesday afternoon\n\n– Drove from the course to Thompson International Airport in the Bahamas, where the private jet took off at 4 p.m. Eastern (\"It was awesome,\" Brown said Thursday. \"My second time ever flying private. It was beautiful.\")\n\n– Landed at 6:30 p.m. Pacific at Palm Springs International Airport\n\n– Got out to PGA West to warm up and roll some putts. (\"I mean, it was blowing 30 the entire way,\" Brown said, \"and then you get here and then it’s perfect.\")\n\nBut could he, you know, play eight straight days? He'd have to make a pair of cuts, too - and he most certainly will, barring the unforeseen, after a Friday at the AmEx few saw coming.\n\nBrown birdied his first hole (the 10th at the Nicklaus Tournament Course). And eagled the second. And birdied the third. And the fourth. And the fifth. And the sixth. And the seventh. He was eight-under - through seven. After a pair of pars, he finished his first nine with a 28. Folks start whispering then. And Brown kept balling. He birdied his 11th hole. And 13th. And 14th. And 15th. He was 12-under on the par-72 - with three holes left to shoot 59. Or 58. Or 57.\n\nBrown parred out. On 18, after a wedge that dropped to within a few feet of the hole, his birdie attempt slid past its right side. \"I was thinking, OK, maybe just a little outside right edge,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it didn’t break.\" Still, a 60 is a 60. That tied for the day's best score.\n\nAnd, through two rounds, Brown is tied for the lead with someone who's seemingly always around the top: world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. Much can happen from here to Sunday, of course, then again, much already has, and here Brown is. Should he win, he'd be the second-youngest ever to do so on the PGA Tour, according to the PGA Tour record books. (The youngest was Charles Kocsis, who, at 18 years, 6 months, 9 days, won the 1931 Michigan Open; Brown turns 19 in May.)\n\nBut again, that's getting ahead of things.\n\nAnd Friday night, Brown was thinking of other things.\n\n\"I’m going to go take a nap after this,\" he said, \"and probably get some food.\"\n\nLet's see if we can find eight more items for the Weekend 9.\n\n2. The PGA Tour social media team captured Brown's trip from the Bahamas to California, and you can watch it below.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, 18-year-old Blades Brown completed the final round @KornFerryTour@BahamasKFTour at The Abaco Club.\n\nOn Thursday morning, he teed it up on TOUR @TheAmExGolf, roughly 2,500 miles west … and he carded a bogey-free 67\n\n— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) January 23, 2026\n\n3. Golf Channel's Brentley Romine also shared this:\n\nIf Blades Brown makes the cut Saturday at The American Express, he's believed to be the first player, at least in modern history, to play eight competitive rounds between the PGA and Korn Ferry tours in as many days.\n\nHowever, I was mistaken in thinking that no other player has… pic.twitter.com/S6jM9D44NB\n\n— Brentley Romine (@BrentleyGC) January 23, 2026\n\n4. This week, I talked to University of Mississippi golf coach Chris Malloy, whose star player, Michael La Sasso, left the Rebels in order to sign a deal from LIV Golf, backed by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund. In doing so, La Sasso gave up a shot at PGA Tour-level golf through the Tour's university program, a chance to defend the NCAA title he won a year ago, and a tee time at this year's Masters, which was given to him through the NCAA victory.\n\nI asked Malloy about the Masters invite and how much that played into his decision, and he said this, which I've been thinking about:\n\n\"You know, not as much as you would think. Mike was pretty good about thinking long term and not being as short-sighted. Certainly that hurt. I don't think he ever imagined himself saying, ‘No, no, I'm not going to go play the Masters this year,' But I'll give him a lot of credit in that regard. Somebody his age going through all this, he really did a good job of thinking long term.\"\n\nThere's a lot to consider here, obviously  - and I'm curious about what you would do. Feel free to email me at nick.piastowski@golf.com.\n\n5. The tweet below, from LIV's Graeme McDowell, was also interesting, as were the responses.\n\nHot take but LIV is a legitimate pathway for young potential superstars who can get paid to be mentored in their young careers by Tour greats and play a guaranteed schedule. The road to the PGA Tour is increasingly perilous and littered with great talent that never made it.\n\n— Graeme McDowell (@Graeme_McDowell) January 20, 2026\n\n6. Brooks Koepka returns to the PGA Tour next week, after four seasons with LIV. I think he'll be asked about his decision to leave.\n\n7. This week, GOLF's Sean Zak profiled Tommy Fleetwood, and it's here where you must - must - read the entire story (which you can do here) and watch the entire YouTube video (which you can do here). Because there are nuggets like this:\n\nThe rep he was earning \"was impossible to ignore,\" he says. Doubts crept in during the tensest moments, an affliction that never plagues the player in 40th place. But rather than coalesce into some unbeatable boogeyman, the close calls somehow reduced Fleetwood's fear of falling short - so long as he forced himself through a sick form of therapy. When it would have been natural to retreat and discreetly lick his wounds, he went straight to the media and rewired his perception of those negative experiences.\n\n\"If you're gonna take the highs, you have to take the hits as well,\" he says now. \"I'm talking to myself when I'm doing those interviews. I knew that if I spoke straight away and said the right things - the things I wanna hear as well - that it was a really important part of the process for me.\"\n\nFleetwood's fearless vulnerability struck such a chord with PGA Tour staffers that, at their annual orientation for rookie players in November, they used his post-Travelers presser as a peak example of media relations. If some of Fleetwood's maxims - \"Thoughts and feelings are the most natural things we have; you can't fight them\" - seem straight out of a self-help manual, they very well might be. He works with sports psychologist Bob Rotella and rereads his books often.\n\nAgain, here is the story link, and here is the video link.\n\n8. With snow storms approaching parts of the country, I thought that the tweet below was worth sharing.\n\n𝗚𝗢𝗟𝗙 𝗜𝗡 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗦𝗡𝗢𝗪? 𝗬𝗢𝗨 𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗟𝗟 𝗖𝗔𝗡!\n\nThese are your options when there is snow or ice on the ground:\n\n1. Treat the snow/ice as a loose impediment, which means you can physically move it just like you would move leaves or twigs. Just be careful not to cause… pic.twitter.com/28xfJ1gTv7\n\n9. This story here is good. Written by Bill Smith of techblog.com, it describes a mini-golf putter that straightens the face as you putt, should you need it.\n\nHe wanted a putter that'd give him a break from those frustrating times when he just can't quite put the ball in the hole despite his best efforts. From the surface, it appears to be a standard-looking club with a machined head and a lengthy shaft, but within it houses a beast of a high-torque brushless motor coupled via a driving shaft to a worm gearbox that allows it to rotate the head around a vertical axis. This configuration maintains the head steady at impact while allowing for extremely quick modifications mid-swing.\n\n10. Let's do 10 items!

They keep me ready.

    "fullText": "Saturday’s NBA table is packed with games that can swing the standings in both conferences. Some teams are trying to stop losing streaks, while others want to protect their home floors. From an early afternoon clash in Philadelphia to a late-night tip in Utah, every matchup brings its own pressure and story. Here is a clear look at the games and the teams most likely to come out on top. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Spectrum Center, Charlotte\n\nWashington enters on a rough stretch. The Wizards are 1-9 in their last 10 games and are allowing over 120 points per game in that span. Injuries have hit them hard, with Marvin Bagley III, Bilal Coulibaly, and Trae Young all sidelined. Scoring has become a problem without steady shooting and rebounding depth.\n\nCharlotte is more stable at home and already beat Washington 126-109 in their last meeting. LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller continue to drive the offense, while Kon Knueppel is shooting over 48 percent from the field. The Hornets also defend better than Washington and force tougher shots. The double-digit spread reflects the gap in form and health. Charlotte should control this game from the second quarter onward.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nPhiladelphia comes off an overtime win against Houston, but their recent run is mixed at 5-5 in the last 10 games. Tyrese Maxey remains the main scoring threat, and Joel Embiid has been steady but not dominant in recent outings.\n\nNew York has struggled against teams above .500, yet their shooting profile gives them an edge here. The Knicks average nearly 15 made three-pointers per game, which is more than Philadelphia usually allows. Karl-Anthony Towns leads them with over 20 points and 11 rebounds per game. The narrow spread shows how close this matchup is. Shot-making from deep and rebounding could tilt it toward New York late.\n\nPredicted winner: New York Knicks\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Target Center, Minneapolis\n\nMinnesota has lost four straight games and has shown defensive leaks during that run. They still score well, averaging 120 points per game on the season, but stopping elite shooters remains a concern.\n\nGolden State enters in better rhythm, winning six of its last ten. Stephen Curry continues to hit close to four threes per game, and the Warriors average over 122 points recently. The Timberwolves won the last meeting, but Curry scored 39 in that game. The plus points suggest a close contest. Experience and perimeter shooting give Golden State a real chance to steal this one on the road.\n\nPredicted winner: Golden State Warriors\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nCleveland just beat Charlotte while holding them under 90 points. Donovan Mitchell led the way with 24 points, and the Cavs grabbed 60 rebounds in that game. Their defense forces turnovers and limits clean looks from three.\n\nOrlando is coming off a heavy loss to Charlotte, allowing over 54 percent shooting. Paolo Banchero scored 23, but the Magic were outworked on both ends. Cleveland ranks sixth in scoring at over 119 points per game and also forces nearly 16 turnovers per night. With better form and more reliable shooting, Cleveland looks ready to edge Orlando even as a slight underdog.\n\nPredicted winner: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nBoston is strong on defense and sits second in the league in points allowed. Jaylen Brown just scored 30 against Indiana, while the team shot over 92 percent from the free-throw line. Their balance between scoring and defense keeps them steady on the road.\n\nChicago plays fast and ranks high in assists, but their defense gives up nearly 120 points per game. Coby White leads the offense, yet the Bulls allow too many open looks from outside. Boston’s ability to control pace and rebound should matter here. The small spread favors the more disciplined team. Boston should pull away late in the fourth.\n\nPredicted winner: Boston Celtics\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center, Dallas\n\nDallas has won three straight at home and has gone 7-3 in its last ten games. Cooper Flagg leads the team in scoring and rebounds, while Naji Marshall has added steady points in recent games. The Mavericks shoot well and protect home court better than their overall record suggests.\n\nLos Angeles relies heavily on Luka Doncic, who is averaging over 33 points per game. The Lakers, however, are 4-6 in their last ten and have struggled with consistency. Dallas lost the first meeting, but this setting favors the home side. The points advantage and recent form make Dallas a solid pick.\n\nPredicted winner: Dallas Mavericks\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Delta Center, Salt Lake City\n\nUtah has been leaky on defense but still scores well, averaging over 117 points per game in the last ten. Keyonte George leads the attack with more than 24 points per game. Home games have been more competitive for the Jazz.\n\nMiami struggles on the road with an 8-15 away record. Their shooting has dipped below 44 percent in recent games, and they allow over 121 points per contest in the last ten. Utah’s pace and scoring should test Miami’s defense. The plus points suggest value on the home team. Utah has the edge in this matchup.\n\nJanuary 24 have some good games overall. Charlotte, Boston, and Cleveland look well positioned, while underdogs like Golden State, Dallas, and Utah have strong upset potential based on form and matchup stats. Fans should expect high-scoring games in Minnesota and Utah, with tighter contests in Philadelphia and Orlando.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 24: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "title": "Fan Focus: What Can Sunderland Expect From West Ham Today?",
    "description": "Ahead of today’s match, we spoke to West Ham fan Dan Woffenden of The West Ham Way website to find out more about them!",
    "fullText": "Back in August Sunderland beat Graham Potter’s West Ham 3-0. What were the key factors that led to him losing his job just a month later?\n\nAn amalgamation of factors. I don’t think he was helped with the squad he inherited, weak in different areas all over the pitch and the summer window compounded that. The biggest problem at West Ham is the lack of planning, our transfer approach is scattergun and we are always reactive rather than proactive.\n\nWe always try to sign names rather than profiles and properly address positions that we need and we are now seeing it come back to bite us. On Potter, he just wasn’t the right fit and didn’t help himself, he was quite insipid and uninspiring and other than that win away at Forest we were really poor. We got some batterings, looked really open defensively and were conceding far too many goals, some of that hasn’t changed, but it was clear that if we kept Potter in position we would have certainly been cut a drift by now.\n\nThe man to replace him was ex-Wolves, Spurs and Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espírito Santo – how has he got on so far and how do fans view him?\n\nIt’s been a very mixed bag. In the first few games against Brentford & Leeds he experimented with the team, played some players out of position and we paid the price with two bad defeats that could be costly come the end of the season. He threw those games away.\n\nWe picked up a few good results after that and it looked like we turned a corner and were building some momentum, but to then go 10 Premier League games without a run was really difficult. A lot of those games came down to fine margins and not being good enough at both ends of the pitch, I think against Bournemouth away, Man United away, Brighton away, Villa at home we deserved to get more, but we dropped points and nothing was really going for us.\n\nThe alarm bells started ringing loudly after that defeat against Wolves, we were awful and it’s probably one of the worst performances I’ve seen from a Premier League team let alone West Ham. We were weak, second to every ball and made some bad mistakes and it wasn’t acceptable. Against Forest we improved, we saw some fight and desire and were unlucky not to go on and win the game, once our second goal was ruled out the game just turned on its head and we collapsed and conceded two really soft goals.\n\nSo, I think myself and the majority of the fans see it as he has a poor squad that needs rebalancing and that he still is the right man for the job. I don’t see any other manager coming in and doing any better than Nuno and sacking him for me would just be us accepting relegation. Spurs was a big improvement, that first-half was our best under Nuno, we defended really well (for a change) and he mixed it up going for a 4-4-2 with the new strikers starting and it worked well and got us a big result, so I’m sure we’ll go into this game with confidence.\n\nCurrently 18th in the Premier League table, are you confident that the Hammers will avoid relegation?\n\nNo, I’m not. I know it’s only 5 points and it can swing in our favour with a few wins and results going our way, but I think the damage has already been done for me.\n\nThis transfer window was a big one for us to strengthen areas and bring in players that could help, but I don’t think we’ll do enough. We need a centre-back or two and the names we are linked with don’t bring me much confidence. Nuno is obsessed with wanting Adama Traore too who doesn’t move the needle for me.\n\nI think Leeds are out of it, they are a good side, I can’t see Bournemouth getting sucked in either. The only side I think could is Crystal Palace, they’ve lost some key players recently and aren’t on a good run, so the wheels could fall off there. With Forest, they will have to get to a point where they sacrifice the Europa League and prioritise the league. The next few weeks are key, they have Leeds away & Wolves at home, so by then we will have a better idea, but I do think it will be a shootout between us and Forest until the end of the season.\n\nUltimately, we’ve got to focus on ourselves and pick up results and let the rest fall into place. We have some winnable games coming up, but whether we have the fight and quality to get through them is a different conversation, I have my doubts.\n\nWest Ham’s last league win at the London Stadium came back in November – I imagine the atmosphere is quite difficult for the players at present?\n\nYes, it is. It’s not a great place to be at the minute and I think the players seem scared of playing there, we are much better away from home.\n\nIt just isn’t a football stadium, and when the chips are down it’s a very soulless place to play and I know there is another protest planned for this game, which Sunderland will have to try and feed off. I do think though better atmosphere comes with better performances, so hopefully the team give us something to shout about as we’ve not had much there.\n\nWest Ham have spent £47m on two strikers during the transfer window in Pablo and Taty Castellanos. Both unknown to most, what have they brought to the table?\n\nDifferent qualities. I think first and foremost we have seen a bit of graft and energy from them which has helped the team. They were both Nuno’s choices through well-known agent Jorge Mendes. I was surprised during the links as our focus this window was on domestic based strikers who had experience of the Premier League, but I think that focus shifted when we discovered that our targets weren’t gettable.\n\nI think they give us different options, at the start of the season we had Fullkrug and Wilson which wasn’t enough. With Taty, we’ve been linked with him previously. He is a bit of a maverick which us West Ham fans love, he is capable of the spectacular, works hard and is good in the air. He’s good technically and will sometimes drop deep to link up play with Pablo running in-behind or them both interchanging. He scored his first goal for us against QPR which was a great header, so I’m excited to see more of him.\n\nPablo was a bit of an unknown, scored 10 goals in his first 13 games at Gil Vicente this season. He’s only 22 so it’s a big ask for a young player to come in and hit the ground running straight away in the situation we are in.\n\nI’ve been impressed so far though, it makes such a difference now Nuno has a target man in his team that can win duels and help us get up the pitch, which we didn’t have before. He started his first PL game against Spurs and did well, worked hard out of possession and played a key part in the first goal by forcing them into a mistake and linking up play well. He still looks a bit raw technically and patience is needed with that, but he will come good and showed during his time in Portugal that he is a clean finisher who gets into good areas. He’s not had many clear chances in front of goal yet, but when that comes I think he will most likely take it. I think he’s a good long-term fit for the striker role.\n\nI read that Lucas Paqueta has requested a move back to Brazil – do you think it’s likely he’ll leave before the end of the transfer window?\n\nI think so. He’s trying to engineer a move and is desperate to go back there, he will be missing for the game this weekend too which isn’t great.\n\nIt’s a bit of an ugly situation, he’s an important player for us and the club don’t want to let him go, but it gets to a point where you are better to cut your losses and reinvest the money elsewhere. The problem is, I don’t have faith in the club to reinvest the money wisely.\n\nNext week will be decisive, we need to sell him before the end of the window, but Brazil’s window doesn’t close until March and that means Flamengo hold the cards. It’s a shame it’s ended this way, but the club need players who are going to fight and get us out of this mess.\n\nWhich of the West Ham players have impressed you most this season and who has been underwhelming?\n\nI’m clutching a bit here! I think Alphonse Areola has done well, he’s made some key saves and has kept us in some games, but other times he’s made some bad mistakes. I don’t think he’s had a lot of protection in some games though and some of the saves he’s pulled off have been outstanding.\n\nI’ve been impressed with Mateus Fernandes too, he’s a quality player, all-action midfielder who has done well. He needs to work on the defensive side of his game a bit, but there is a player there with a lot of potential. I would probably throw Walker-Peters in there too, every time he’s featured he’s been solid. Jean-Clair Todibo has really stepped up under Nuno recently too, he looks like a different player compared to earlier in the season.\n\nIn terms of underwhelming, I don’t think Jarrod Bowen has been in the best of form. You can never question his effort, but he hasn’t been his usual self and I think he’s been affected by poor players around him, so hopefully the two strikers can help him and bring that spark back. Crysencio Summerville is another one too, has bags of pace and ability but hasn’t delivered enough this season and I expected more. He’s got a few goals recently though so hopefully that will help him to kick on.\n\nMax Kilman has been the worst of the lot, I don’t like singling players out but he has been at the tip of the iceberg. He just never looks comfortable, gets bullied too easily and makes too many mistakes.\n\nIf you were Regis Le Bris, how would you set up to beat West Ham?\n\nThe simple answer, spam crosses into the box. West Ham have conceded the most headed goals in the league this season, we are very vulnerable from them and teams clearly target that.\n\nYou have good technicians and some very powerful players, so even if we clear the first delivery, the second phase is just as important and I’m sure RLB will emphasise that to his players. You have Ballard, Alderete, Brobbey who can all cause problems and will most likely look to target our full-backs who aren’t the strongest aerially.\n\nI know out of possession you have been very adaptable, but I do think we are shaky when teams press us high when we are building from deep. Spurs were quite passive and gave us too much time which allowed us to play through, but I expect Sunderland to be much more compact when they sit off us. I think if you force us long, you are more than capable of winning those duels in the air and then gaining some control, so we have to look to go wide and look to get in-behind rather than play in front of you.\n\nI think Brobbey will be key to your approach, he loves to drop deep and I think if he makes the right runs, engages defenders to pull out that can create space in-behind which we are vulnerable to, so it’s something we’ve got to manage.\n\nWhat style of play can Sunderland expect to encounter?\n\nI expect it to be quite a physical game, cagey and maybe a case of one team waiting for the other to make a mistake before the game becomes more open.\n\nI think we will continue in our shape from Spurs, which was a 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1 in possession, the full-backs will push up high to support the attack, while you might see Summerville drift inside to get the ball and then also mainly stay wide. We will look to play through the thirds, but as I said maybe go long into wider areas and try to stretch your defence that way. I know when teams have settled possession Sunderland like to defend in a 5-4-1 at times and make it very difficult, and I worry without Paqueta we will struggle to break you down and create clear cut chances.\n\nOff the ball, similar shape in a 4-4-2, funnel you wide and then look to lock on and be aggressive. I think we’ll look to start fast and take the game to you, so I think Sunderland will have to manage that.\n\nAre any players missing and who do you think will start?\n\nPaqueta and Fabianski are out, Diouf will hopefully return from AFCON to have a place on the bench. Other than that I’m expecting the same eleven that started against Spurs.\n\nAreola (GK), Wan-Bissaka, Mavropanos, Todibo, Scarles, Bowen, Soucek, Fernandes, Summerville, Pablo, Taty Castellanos.\n\nIt will be Sunderland’s first visit to the London Stadium – what is your prediction for the final score?\n\nI think it’ll be a tight game, quite cagey too. I have been really impressed with Sunderland and it’s nice to see a team bridge that gap after getting promoted. You had a plan when you came up and have made some really smart signings.\n\nI know you haven’t had the best of time away from the Stadium of Light, but I think apart from that Brentford result you have been in a lot of games and competed well, so it’s come down to fine margins and I don’t think you are far away from getting a win.\n\nMy optimistic side is saying a draw, so I’ll go with 1-1.",

    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics will make the trip to Illinois to take on the Chicago Bulls in the second game of a back-to-back on this Saturday (Jan. 24) night after gutting out a double-overtime win vs. an Eastern Conference foe in New York City the night before.\n\nThe Celtics could be without at least one of the regular starters in the tilt if the injury report remains the same, but exhaustion from the especially long contest on the first half of the back-to-back is a more likely threat to Boston racking up another win. The Celtics ought to come away with a victory if they bring their best to bear, but it is unclear if they will have the legs to do so.\n\nAt present, the Celtics have a 28-16 record and a two-game win streak coming into the tilt. That has them second in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\nThe Bulls are the owners of a 22-22 record and a three-game win streak, good enough for ninth place in the East.\n\nBoston beat the Brooklyn Nets 130-126 on the road.\n\nChicago beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 120-115, also on the road.\n\nFor the Celtics, no report was available with the game the night before, but in that game, Jayson Tatum (Achilles) was out, as was Josh Minott (ankle) and Derrick White (rest).\n\nFor the Bulls, Zach Collins (toe) and Noa Essengue (shoulder) are out.\n\nHere's when you should tune in to see the game:\n\nLive Stream: Fubo (watch for free)\n\nBlue Wire: https://tiny.ee/CdKp\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: Celtics at Bulls: Stream, lineups, injury reports, broadcast (1/24)",

    "title": "Starting XI: Xhaka Out? Diarra And Talbi Back? Is This Sunderland’s Team To Take On West Ham?",
    "description": "Is this how Sunderland will line up at the London Stadium today?",
    "fullText": "With Habib Diarra and Chemsdine Talbi back from AFCON, Sunderland have a full strength squad to choose from… or is that HAD a full strength squad to choose from? Last night, rumours were swirling around on social media that Granit Xhaka had an injury that would keep him out for a couple of months – although subsequent rumours suggested it wasn’t as serious as all that, and it was an injury he’d been playing with for the past few weeks. We know Xhaka’s travelled with the squad from the pictures the club posted online, so fingers crossed he’s fit and the rumours are a load of rubbish! On the basis of Xhaka being fit, here’s how I think we’ll line up today.\n\nRoefs made a couple of good saves early on against Palace to prevent us from going behind earlier than we did. He’ll have been a little disappointed he didn’t get more on the ball in the lead up to Palace’s goal, but he had another fine game overall – something we’ve come to expect now!\n\nIt was great to see Reinildo back in the team last week – he offers so much in every department and is a class act. Ballard and Alderete performed well too; indeed it was Ballard and Mukiele who were heavily involved in the build up to Le Fee’s goal on Saturday, and they were solid defensively, too. Unchanged at the back.\n\nTrai Hume will be in the team, and he’ll play in that hybrid right midfield / centre midfield / right back / centre back position that enables other people such as Ballard and Mukiele to spring forward, as we saw in the build up to Le Fee’s goal on Saturday. I’m hedging my bets and saying Xhaka will play, but if not I think it’ll be Geertruida who comes in as a straight swap. I reckon Diarra will be on the bench today as he is reintegrated back into the team, while Sadiki and Le Fee will stay in their usual positions – Le Bris hinted as much regarding Le Fee, so I don’t see any change there. The only question for me is who plays on the left. Romaine Mundle’s done ok in recent weeks but is still building his match fitness, and something just doesn’t seem right with Adingra, so we could see Talbi straight back in the team. The question here is his fitness – frustratingly he barely played at AFCON, so he could either be raring to go or in need of some training to get up to match sharpness. If it’s the former, I think he’ll be straight back in.\n\nBrobbey’s been superb recently and will be vitally important today as he looks to add to his goal tally so far. His fitness is spot on now and he’s holding the ball up brilliantly. Hopefully we can get the ball to him a bit more as he’s capable of scoring a decent amount of goals for us, given the chance.",

    "description": "“Parkinson was right; Doncaster made it very difficult and it appeared that Sunderland were going to have to adapt again as coaches began to do their homework on them.\"",
    "fullText": "Though this draw against Doncaster Rovers made it eight games without a defeat, the away side’s impressive rearguard performance ensured that we did not get the much-sought-after three points.\n\nAfter a miserable run up until the Christmas fixture list which left Sunderland manager Phil Parkinson under immense pressure, they appeared to be now finding their feet under their new manager after the dismissal of Jack Ross.\n\nParkinson’s job was under much scrutiny and something had to change for the team to pick up better results. This led to a change in formation where the team adapted wing-backs bombing forward to good effect.\n\nIn particular, this formation was suiting Denver Hume in the left wing-back role where his performance against Wycombe Wanderers at the Stadium of Light was particularly impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, despite a frantic performance where Parkinson said the team played at “a hundred miles an hour” in the first half, Doncaster played an extremely defensive game that caused the disruption that it was intended to.\n\nWhilst having plenty of the ball and an abundance of half-chances, the team barely created a clear opportunity other than Luke O’Nien and Duncan Watmore’s joint effort in added time that was saved.\n\nAfter the game, Parkinson bemoaned the fact that the team couldn’t find an opening but suggested that teams were learning on how to deal with the team’s new style of play.\n\nIf you look at the last two home games against Lincoln City and Wycombe Wanderers [when Sunderland took commanding leads inside half an hour], teams are going to watch that and Doncaster did a change-around in the way they have been playing away from home, added an extra midfield player to make it difficult for us, and they stiffened things up a bit.\n\nParkinson was right; Doncaster made it very difficult and it appeared that Sunderland were going to have to adapt again as coaches began to do their homework on them.\n\nDespite the disappointment with the draw, the result actually lifted the team to 5th in the table which was a huge improvement given the fact they were lower mid-table at Christmas.\n\nMore dramatic circumstances were only around the corner as the pandemic landed on British shores in March.",

    "title": "4 Takeaways from Cavs 123-118 win over Kings: Evan Mobley puts together ‘dominant’ game",
    "description": "Mobley’s aggressive scoring carried the Cavs to an ugly win.",
    "fullText": "CLEVELAND — The Cleveland Cavaliers have won nine of their last 13 games, and still aren’t close to playing up to their full potential. That’s both encouraging and frustrating. Friday’s ugly 123-118 win against the Sacramento Kings showed why.\n\nHead coach Kenny Atkinson has made some crazy comparisons during his two seasons in Cleveland. After Evan Mobley’s 29-point, 13-rebound, and seven-assist performance, he compared him to Shaquille O’Neal.\n\n“Man, I don’t know about that,” Mobley said.\n\nMobley wasn’t Shaq, but he completely controlled the paint on both sides of the floor.\n\nBefore the game, Kings head coach Doug Christie said his team needed to push Mobley off of his spots. That didn’t happen.\n\nMobley went 6-8 on shots in the restricted area and 12-18 on overall shots in the paint. He was able to get to the basket on repeat, and when he was cut off, the hook shot and turnaround jumper were falling. Mobley is at his best when he’s playing aggressively and making quick and strong decisions. That — combined with going against a weaker Sacramento frontcourt — led to his scoring success.\n\n“That’s what we like to see,” Donovan Mitchell said of Mobley’s mindset. “A lot of times, he just has to go up and be aggressive, and that’s what he was for 48 minutes tonight. He was like, ‘I’m going to attack and make good decisions.’ … Not so much necessarily us continuing to get it to him, but him being like, ‘I’m getting downhill. They can’t stop me. I’m getting to the paint.’”\n\nThe offensive showcase extended to his playmaking as well. Mobley has become more comfortable finding the open man when extra defenders have come his way. This is the area he’s grown the most since the beginning of the season, when he had a difficult time handling double teams.\n\nAnything bought from the links helps support Fear the Sword. You can buy the Mark Price shirt HERE. You can also shop all of Homage’s Cavs gear HERE.\n\nMobley was more impressive defensively.\n\nHe registered four blocks and was a large reason why the Kings converted just 62.5% of their shots at the rim (32nd percentile).\n\nMobley was able to make what was an overall bad performance from his teammates look passable. It’s why the Cavs had a solid 108.7 defensive rating with Mobley on the floor on a night they had a 121.6 defensive rating as a team.\n\n“It was one of the most dominant games we’ve ever seen from him,” Atkinson said.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time we’ve seen something like this from Mobley. He performed to this level in the first half of Wednesday’s win against the Charlotte Hornets. He scored 13 points on 5-6 shooting in the first two quarters before taking just three shots in the second half.\n\nThese types of games are in there. The problem is figuring out how to recreate these performances more consistently.\n\n“Sometimes these things happen when you have guys out,” Atkinson said. “We have Sam [Merrill], Max [Strus], and DG (Darius Garland), our playmakers, guys that create advantages. We got him out there with units, especially when we separate those two (Mobley and Donovan Mitchell). Now, no Don, he’s got to kind of do it. I’m sure we’re doing more things for him, but I think he’s just taking the burden. I think it’s a lot of its circumstances.”\n\nAtkinson has been splitting up Mitchell and Mobley more with bench lineups. That wasn’t what Atkinson did most of the last regular season, when the duo was in the 94th percentile in point differential. It hasn’t had the same success this year, and more importantly, lineups without either haven’t worked with Darius Garland not at 100%.\n\n“I got to be the guy that creates offense for us,” Mobley said. “I feel like I’ve been doing a good job this past few days, and I feel like I just got to keep stacking days and figure out where I can keep getting better.”\n\nThe consistency isn’t quite there for the Cavs yet either.\n\nThey took meaningful steps forward in this game. Instead of turning it over 21 times, as they did in their previous two outings, they gave it away just six times (97th percentile).\n\nThat said, they didn’t improve in all the areas they would’ve liked to. Their defensive integrity at the point of attack remains a concern. It’s part of the reason they allowed the Kings to shoot 39.4% from beyond the arc, which is well above their season-long average of 35.2%.\n\nStill, the Cavs need all the wins they can get at this point of the season, given who’s out of the lineup. They’ve done a better job of taking care of their matchups against opponents that they should beat, even if they aren’t exactly peaking at this time.\n\n“It’s not always going to be pretty,” Mitchell said. “It’s at the point now where I don’t really care how we do it as long as we continue to win games. … I think we’ve done a great job of believing as a collective.\n\n“Last year was last year. It’s a different year, different season. This is who we are. We’re going to continue to build and find ways to win.”",

    "title": "Arizona GymCats rebound from road struggles with season high score",
    "description": "Arizona scored over 49 on each of the four events",
    "fullText": "In a year when a late change to the rules made road meets more important than ever, the Arizona GymCats didn’t need what happened last week at Texas Woman’s University. The team scored a 193.350 to lose to both TWU and Denver in a nonconference matchup against the Pioneers. They rebounded with gusto against Towson, winning 196.800 to 195.400 in McKale Center on Friday evening.\n\n“We had a breakdown on the fundamentals of our program that have made our program what it is,” said Arizona head coach John Court. “I wasn’t shy about letting them know that, and it’s been a very intentional week of practice. It’s been a difficult week of practice, but it’s been the week that they needed…It was a gut check. And I told them tonight, their season starts. I said, this is your season opener tonight. And I said, you need to show everybody exactly who you are. And they were able to go out and do that. Very proud.”\n\nArizona’s loss at TWU was a historic low for the program. The GymCats had not scored below 194 since Jan. 22, 2022 when they scored a 193.775 in their home opener against Oklahoma, Stanford, and Utah State. They had not scored below the 193.350 they got in Denton, Tex. since Feb. 17, 2018 at Oregon State. That meet saw Arizona send just two athletes up on vault, three on floor, five on bars, and six on balance beam to end with a score of 145.325.\n\n“I said, this is the worst meet I’ve been a part of as a head coach,” Court said. “Because at least in that meet [at Oregon State], I knew we couldn’t score higher than, like, a 140. And it’s different. You know, this team is not last year’s team. It’s not the team before that. You’re replacing at least 10 routines, and you’re replacing some veteran leadership across the board. So different people need to need to step up, and they were able to do that tonight.”\n\nThe team needed to put up a big score Friday night if they hoped to salvage a postseason berth. They also needed to do it to prove that last week was a fluke.\n\nThey made their statement from the first vault of the meet and carried it through the final floor routine. They hit all 24 routines and had just four scores below 9.8. They were able to drop three of those scores.\n\nThe GymCats scored over 49 points on all four events, something that doesn’t happen for them very often. They accomplished the feat at last year’s Big 12 Championships but had not done it in the regular season since Mar. 13, 2024 against Southern Connecticut State.\n\nIt looked like problems might crop up on balance beam, though. While beam has been a strong event in recent years, the GymCats have been inconsistent on it this year. Part of that is replacing the routines of Alysen Fears, Emily Mueller, and Elena Deets, all of whom finished their college careers last season. That leaves half the rotation open for new athletes.\n\nGianna Lenczner’s 9.750 was a solid leadoff score, but Emma Strom followed with a 9.700. Next came a 9.675 from Jessa Janicke. Things were moving in the wrong direction for the team.\n\nUp came Teagan White. The sophomore spent last year rehabbing an injury. Her college debut earned a 9.850 and got the rotation back on track. It also got her tabbed as the Gymnast of the Meet by the Arizona coaching staff.\n\n“She is scruffy,” junior all-arounder Abigayle Martin said. “She has never exhibitioned, never done anything. She had her third knee surgery last year, like I would say, I think 13 months ago, and I felt so good about her going up there. I knew she was going up there. I knew she was gonna go in. I knew she was gonna attack it. I knew she was very calm. And I don’t normally watch the beam routines in front of me, but I was peeping out from the hallway because I had 100 percent confidence that she was gonna make it. And I truly think that’s what elevated the rest of the routines from the night, like carrying on into floor.”\n\nWise and Martin followed White. Wise matched her 9.850 and Martin scored a season-high 9.900 to anchor the rotation.\n\n“She had a great meet last week,” Court said. “And this is the gymnastics that Tirzah has always been capable of. She’s very confident this year. And she’s done some things so she could be a little more dedicated. She’s an engineering major, so I think she rearranged her schedule. Maybe not taking 25 credits this semester.”\n\nMartin and her teammates kept it going on floor exercise. She was one of three GymCats to set or tie their career highs on the event. They posted just one score below 9.800. That 9.775 was dropped, leaving them a 49.450 for the final rotation.\n\n“[Martin’s] floor was amazing tonight,” Court said. “Best floor to she’s ever done in an Arizona leotard, for sure.”\n\nMartin was as symbol of both the struggles at TWU and the team’s rebound against Towson. On Friday, she turned in scores of 9.800 on vault and bars, 9.900 on balance beam, and 9.950 on floor exercise. The team had 10 athletes set or tie career highs on at least one event.\n\n“As a team, I think we were kind of just off,” Martin said. “This is a really new team, and there’s been a lot of lineup changes from meet one, meet two even to meet three. On a personal level, had a really scary fall. Peeled off the high bar, couldn’t finish the routine. And I think coming back for me mentally, it was definitely like a grind week, not physically, but like up in the brain.”\n\nAt Texas Woman’s, Martin was one of three UA gymnasts to score a 9.200 or lower on bars. Two others scored 9.150 or lower on balance beam. Only one scored as high as 9.800 on floor exercise.\n\nThey all hope to follow the lead of Wise, who has been a model of consistency this season. Her only score below 9.800 this season was a 9.750 on balance beam in the season opener.\n\n“This year, I definitely feel more just confident being out there,” Wise said. “I mean, it is my third year here. I’m a junior now. Just being able to trust my training and really trust what I’ve done in and out of the gym is super important.”\n\nEvery meet will take on a bigger import this season after what happened at TWU, especially when the GymCats leave McKale Center. That goes back to the NCAA’s change to the NQS formula that was implemented just weeks before the season started and long after schedules were set. The new rules require teams to use five road scores in the NQS, although the lowest one can still be dropped. Arizona has just six road meets this season, including the Big 12 Championships.\n\nThere’s only one way to overcome that score.\n\n“Do things like they did tonight, but they have to hit on the road,” Court said. “Home’s a little bit more comfortable…Every team in the country has to hit on the road, and that certainly includes us.”\n\nWhile the score from the TWU meet will probably go away by the time regionals are determined, it will hit Arizona’s ranking until at least that time. That includes for seeding at the Big 12 Championships, which are based on NQS rather than win/loss records. Depending on how others do, it will likely put Arizona in the early session of the championships instead of the more desirable late session.\n\n“It’s gonna hang around,” Court said. “We’re gonna use it for our Big 12 calculation. You want it to disappear for your regional calculation, but it will stay for the Big 12 calculation. I just hope it doesn’t hurt us too much.”",

    "description": "An analysis of long-run performance for the GTP challengers ahead of the 2026 Rolex 24 at Daytona International Speedway",
    "fullText": "After three practice sessions at the Rolex 24, the world looks very different at the start of the 2026 IMSA SportsCar Championship season than it did last weekend at the \"Roar\" pre-season test. There are new favorites in both the GTP and GTD Pro classes.\n\nAs with the Roar, we analyzed all times in the GTP class that were under 1:40 minutes and calculated the average. It should be noted that there have been no changes to the Balance of Performance (BoP) since the pre-test.\n\nTake a look at the following individual results for the three free practice sessions:\n\nThe result of the third free practice session in particular should be treated with caution, as there were three interruptions with red flags.\n\nLet's now look at all three sessions combined. If we take all laps under 1:40 minutes and calculate the average, we get the following order:\n\n1. MSR-Acura #60 - 1:37.530 (43 laps under 1:40)\n\n2. AXR-Cadillac #31 - 1:37.812 (70)\n\n3. Penske-Porsche #6 - 1:37.838 (69)\n\n4. Penske-Porsche #7 - 1:37.848 (76)\n\n5. WTR-Cadillac #10 - 1:38.012 (68)\n\n6. WTR-Cadillac #40 - 1:38.031 (60)\n\n7. MSR-Acura #93 - 1:38.065 (53)\n\n9. JDC-Miller-Porsche #85 - 1:38.214 (84)\n\n10. WRT-BMW #25 - 1:38.261 (33)\n\n11. Thor-Aston-Martin #23 - 1:38.613 (52)\n\nThe Meyer Shank Acura #60 (Blomqvist/Braun/Dixon/Allmendinger) is suddenly the fastest car in the field by a relatively clear margin. Does that suddenly make Acura the favorite?\n\nRenger van der Zande from the sister #93 Acura firmly denies the narrative that they are the favorites: \"Honestly, not really. I think we have a very good car for qualifying. But I don't think we have the fastest car in the race, and that worries me. I think Cadillac and Porsche are in the best position. Hopefully I'm wrong.\"\n\nThe competition laughed at such statements. \"They're the world champions at playing down their chances,\" said one individual from the Porsche camp. And Cadillac also has the Honda luxury brand on its radar. On the other hand, Acura's argument is supported by the fact that both ARX-06s have completed comparatively few laps under 1:40 minutes.\n\nSpeaking of Cadillac: the Action Express Cadillac #31 (Aitken/Bamber/Vesti/Zilisch) finished just ahead of the two factory Porsches on average. The two Cadillac V-Series.R cars from Wayne Taylor Racing follow behind, while the Meyer-Shank Acura #93 (van der Zande/Yelloly/Palou/Ohta) fielded by HRC is likely to have completed a different program than the #60.\n\nBMW M Team WRT boss Vosse: ‘Give us time’ with IMSA program\n\nThere are worries at BMW. WRT's debut as a GTP team was marked by alarm for a long time. The car didn't make it into the window, the major aero update didn't seem to work properly, and the drivers were unhappy with the handling.\n\nBut in the very last practice session, a trick was pulled off that at least gives the WRT camp some hope. However, it is doubtful that this will be enough to close a gap of well over half a second.\n\nWRT is still enjoying support from the WEC crew on the operational side at the IMSA opener. This is only logical given the winter break in the world championship. WRT team boss Vincent Vosse asks for a little patience in an interview with Motorsport-Total.com:\n\n\"If you compare us to the US teams, we are complete rookies. We are starting from scratch. Of course, we bring experience [from the WEC] with us and have some new recruits in the team who were already active in IMSA last year. But all of that has to come together and work. This is our first race, so please give us some time.\"\n\nBut how much patience will BMW have? In the fourth year of the LMDh program, success is a must. \"The question is not how much time we need,\" Vosse interjects. \"The question is: 'What do we need?' And that's a multitude of things that also have to be brought together.\" Vosse knows what he's talking about; after all, WRT is the benchmark in GT3 racing.\n\nAnd Aston Martin? The situation has not improved since the pre-test. \"Daytona is a very special track. We can't take much from Le Mans either, because that's a special track in its own right.\"\n\nLet's take another look at the improvements compared to last week's pre-test.\n\n1. MSR-Acura #60 - 1.004 seconds faster than at the \"Roar\"\n\n9. Thor-Aston Martin #23 - 0.317\n\n10. JDC-Miller-Porsche #85 - 0.253\n\nOn average, the GTP cars improved by around four tenths of a second. Aston Martin only managed a jump of 0.317 seconds on average across all lap times under 1:40 minutes.\n\nThe improvement was also minimal for Porsche. All three 963s are below the median improvement. The biggest jump was made by the #6 Penske-Porsche (L. Vanthoor/Estre/Campbell) with 0.353 seconds.\n\nAt Cadillac, Action Express Racing improved significantly more than the two V-Series.R entries from Wayne Taylor Racing. However, Acura made the biggest leap. There could be many reasons for this from improvements in the setup to sandbagging in the pre-season test, or several other factors.\n\nThe race will be particularly exciting due to two factors that also interact with each other: the new Michelin tires and the weather.\n\nThe new generation of slicks with their spectacular appearance are said to impress above all with their improved warm-up behavior, but also bring improvements in terms of durability. Jack Aitken, who had put the #31 Cadillac on pole before being penalized, said when asked by Motorsport.com that the differences were not that great, at least in qualifying.\n\nThe weather forecast is spectacular with temperatures approaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit predicted for Sunday. Even for Florida, this is exceptionally high for January, and the race could be one of the warmest in history.\n\nThis means that the soft tires will only be used briefly during the night, if at all. Michelin has allowed a window from 5 p.m. to 10 a.m. for the use of soft tires, which is larger than in previous years. But the temperatures significantly narrow this window.\n\nAnd this is where Acura's concern comes into play. Van der Zande: \"We tend to put a little more strain on the tires than Porsche and Cadillac when accelerating out of hairpin turns. That makes it more difficult for us in longer stints.\" And high temperatures don't help either. But a yellow phase in the last hour might...\"\n\nRexy vs. Grello: The Porsche icons prepare to face off in Rolex 24\n\n2016 Rolex 24: Remembering the thrilling Corvette photo finish\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The Manchester City defence has been ravaged by injury. Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol both went down with injuries in their team’s 1-all draw with Chelsea earlier this month. Their absence has hurt Pep Guardiola’s side. Max Alleyne and Abdukodir Khusanov have both been forced to step up in their absence. Both players are young and have done the best they can in a difficult situation. Unfortunately for Max Alleyne he made two mistakes which cost his team against Bodø/Glimt. It is likely that he will be replaced in Manchester City’s defence by City’s new signing Marc Guehi today against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nMarc Guehi’s debut feels like an important moment in Manchester City’s season. The England international is expected to make an immediate impact on Manchester City’s defence. He is more than capable of doing so, and if he does, Pep Guardiola’s side should be a stronger proposition at the back almost immediately.\n\nAfter signing for Manchester City from Crystal Palace, Marc Guehi arrives at Manchester City as a ready-made defender. Guehi established himself as one of the best centre-backs in the Premier League during his time at Crystal Palace. There is no reason why Guehi cannot quickly make his presence felt in Manchester City’s defence. All of the best attributes of Guehi’s game look to be well-suited to life in a Pep Guardiola side.\n\nIn possession, Marc Guehi is a composed player and he has all the necessary traits to be a Manchester City centre-back. Guehi has proven for England and Crystal Palace that he is adept with the ball at his feet. What catches the eye with Guehi’s work in possession is his ability to play a long ball across the pitch. Guehi switches the play with ease, and it is easy to see Pep Guardiola tapping into this weapon that Marc Guehi possesses. Given that Guehi prefers to play as the left centre-back in a pairing, his ability to pick out Antoine Semenyo on the right wing, for example, could be of immense value to Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nMarc Guehi is an exceptional defender. Manchester City are crying out for an experienced centre-back who adds a sense of calm to his team. Guehi is precisely that. He is strong aerially, and uses his body well in aerial duels. That attribute could be crucial against Wolves today. Guehi is strong in a duel and a challenge, and his addition to the City squad should strengthen a City defence that has looked shaky recently.\n\nI’m not suggesting that Marc Guehi will debut for Manchester City today and Pep Guardiola’s side will immediately get back to their best. That isn’t realistic. But Guehi’s debut does feel like an important moment in Manchester City’s season. Guehi will be expected to step in and add leadership, poise and quality to a City defence that has struggled recently. The England international is more than capable of doing that job. It would be great if he contribute that today against Wolves.",

    "description": "Senior #3 Brock Hardy earned his 100th career win Friday night in front of a record home crowd",
    "fullText": "Despite winning the final two matches to make the dual look closer than it was, the #6 Nebraska wrestling team struggled early and often against #4 Iowa Friday night in front of a record crowd\n\nA program record 7,891 fans traversed the frigid weather Friday night to see their Huskers take on the Hawkeyes, a team they haven’t beaten since 2005 — well before Nebraska’s move to the Big Ten. After losing the first two matches, Nebraska was never able to catch the Hawkeyes in this dual, especially after Iowa picked up a pinfall win early in the night to go up 12-3.\n\nHusker Nation showed out once again.\n\nTonight’s crowd of 7,891 is a new program record. pic.twitter.com/92IKI1AsYy\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) January 24, 2026\n\nNebraska won four of the ten bouts in its 22-14 loss to the Hawkeyes. It was Iowa head coach Tom Brands’ 300th career dual win.\n\nTaking the mat first was Alan Koehler for Nebraska against Iowa backup Joey Cruz.\n\nCruz got in on a single-leg early in the first period for a takedown to go up 3-0. Koehler then scored a quick escape and another escape in the second period. Cruz started the third period with an escape in the third period and held on for the 4-2 win over Koehler.\n\nWith the loss, Koehler is now 10-11 on the year.\n\nI’d expect to see Kael Lauridsen get his shot on Sunday against Ohio State.\n\nNebraska’s #8 Jacob Van Dee came out with a lot of energy and looked to be shot out of a cannon with a first-period takedown, but it was all Iowa’s #11 Drake Ayala after that.\n\nAyala scored three takedowns throughout the rest of the match and collected a riding-time point for the 12-6 decision win over Van Dee.\n\nAt 133, No. 10 Drake Ayala (Iowa) wins 12–5 over No. 8 Jacob Van Dee (Nebraska), scoring three takedowns and adding riding time.\n\nStrong, controlled win for the Hawkeye. pic.twitter.com/oRXGJiYOcS\n\n— Saturday Night Lights (@WrestlingSNL) January 24, 2026\n\nWith the loss, Van Dee drops to 12-2 on the year.\n\nIn a hard-fought match, Nebraska’s #3 Brock Hardy reached a major career milestone in winning his 100th career match against Iowa’s #13 Nasir Bailey.\n\n1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ and counting…\n\nCongrats on the milestone, Brock! pic.twitter.com/yzG9qfcCNu\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) January 24, 2026\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, Hardy scored an escape to go up 1-0 to begin the second period. In the third, Bailey chose neutral and was unable to get through Hardy’s defense.\n\nWith the 1-0 decision win, Hardy is now 13-3 on the year and 100-27 for his career. Hardy is Nebraska’s 32nd 100-match winner.\n\nNebraska’s #12 Chance Lamer wrestled a tough match but was caught in the end in a cradle that really gave Iowa the momentum that they never really lost.\n\nIowa’s #10 Ryder Block struck first with a takedown off the opening whistle, but Lamer took the lead in the second period with a takedown of his own. Block was able to tie things at 5-5 with a pair of escapes before getting in on a single-leg in the third and tripping Lamer right into the cradle that ended things with a stick.\n\nThe first pin of the dual comes in an upset W for @Hawks_Wrestling’s No. 17 Ryder Block over No. 14 Chance Lamer 📌 pic.twitter.com/bauMndtwWw\n\n— Big Ten Wrestling (@B1GWrestling) January 24, 2026\n\nIowa took an imposing 12-3 lead with the pin, swinging all the momentup toward the Hawkeyes.\n\nWith the loss, Lamer is now 12-2 this season but just 2-2 in duals.\n\nFacing Iowa’s #11 Jordan Williams, Nebraska’s #5 Antrell Taylor withstood a game opponent for the eventual win in sudden victory.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, both wrestlers traded escapes in the second and third period before heading to sudden victory. In overtime, Taylor was the aggressor as he kept attacking Williams toward the edge, nearly scoring the takedown. After Williams got away, Taylor continued pushing him out of bounds to draw the deciding (second) stall call and the point for the 2-1 win.\n\nTrelly wins his 8th straight with a 2-1 sudden victory 💪 pic.twitter.com/8HEjUAUtTo\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) January 24, 2026\n\nWith the win Taylor is now 14-2 on the year.\n\nIn this match between Nebraska’s #7 LJ Araujo and Iowa’s #3 Michael Caliendo, the Hawkeye senior proved to be too much for the redshirt freshman.\n\nCaliendo collected four takedowns in the match on the way to the 14-4 win via major decision over Araujo. An NCAA finalist, Caliendo used his relentless style to earn the bonus points, putting Iowa up 16-6 in the dual.\n\nMajor decision Mikey strikes again ⚡\n\nThe @Hawks_Wrestling 165 pounder earned a 14-4 top-10 decision over LJ Araujo 👀 pic.twitter.com/W6QgMEHxRY\n\n— Big Ten Wrestling (@B1GWrestling) January 24, 2026\n\nWith the loss, Araujo is now 10-5 on the year.\n\nIn another matchup between Top-10 wrestlers, Nebraska’s #6 Christopher Minto was unable to handle the pressure and relentlessness of Iowa’s #3 Patrick Kennedy.\n\nBoth wrestlers scored escapes in regulation, sending the match to overtime. After a scoreless sudden victory period, Kennedy scored an immediate escape in the first tiebreaker, forcing Minto to choose neutral in the second tiebreaker. Minto was unable to get a takedown in the final 30-second period, dropping the match 2-1.\n\nA gritty 2-1 top-10 W by No. 3 at 174 lbs Patrick Kennedy over No. 6 Christopher Minto 😤 pic.twitter.com/cXCKXpdfSb\n\n— Big Ten Wrestling (@B1GWrestling) January 24, 2026\n\nWith the loss, Minto drops to 13-3 on the year.\n\nNebraska’s #7 Silas Allred took on a familiar opponent Friday night in Iowa’s Gabe Arnold. After splitting one-takedown matches last year, the two had another one.\n\nArnold was able to strike first with a first-period takedown. The two traded escapes in the second and third periods, but Allred was unable to get in for a score on Arnold, dropping the match 4-1.\n\nWith the loss, Allred falls to 11-5 on the year.\n\nIn one of the bright spots for the Huskers, sophomore #11 Camden McDanel took care of business against Brody Sampson.\n\nMcDanel scored a late first-period takedown before adding another in the second to go up 7-1. McDanel then collected four takedowns in the third period to earn the 20-5 win via technical fall, cutting the Iowa lead to 22-11.\n\n197 | Cam gets the tech fall win over Sampson. pic.twitter.com/XP0BPvptEd\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) January 24, 2026\n\nWith the win, McDanel improves to 13-4 on the year. He scored six of Nebraska’s nine total takedowns on the night.\n\nNebraska’s #4 AJ Ferrari took the mat against Iowa’s #12 Ben Kueter here.\n\nLate in the first period, Ferrari hit Kueter with a double-leg takedown to go up 3-0. Ferrari then scored an escape in the second to go up 4-0. In the third period, Kueter earned an eventual escape but was unable to take Ferrari down despite a late shot that nearly got him\n\nFerrari picks up another top-10 win, 4-1 over No. 8 Kueter. pic.twitter.com/9X1QrX0efX\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) January 24, 2026\n\nWith the win, Ferrari improves to 8-1 on the year.",

    "fullText": "Extreme heat triggered a suspension of play on outside courts at the Australian Open on Saturday and briefly held up champion Jannik Sinner before he battled into the last 16.\n\nPlayers and spectators roasted on day seven at Melbourne Park, where temperatures were forecast to hit 40C.\n\nThe tournament has a Heat Stress Scale of 1-5, with five the highest.\n\nIt hit five in the early afternoon, when it was about 36C, prompting the suspension.\n\nThe third-round meeting between Sinner and the American Eliot Spizzirri at Rod Laver Arena stopped for about 10 minutes, allowing time for the roof to close.\n\nIt helped save Sinner, who was suffering cramp and wilting in the heat.\n\nWith the roof shut he pulled through 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 over a gruelling 3hr 45min.\n\n\"I struggled physically a bit today as you saw. I got lucky with the heat rule, they closed the roof,\" said the second seed.\n\nHis reward is a clash next will fellow Italian Luciano Darderi, the 22nd seed, who defeated Russia's Karen Khachanov in four sets.\n\nOn a red-letter day for Italy, fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti saw off Tomas Machac in five sets to reach round four.\n\nMusetti goes up against either American ninth seed Taylor Fritz or the Swiss veteran Stan Wawrinka next.\n\nThe 40-year-old Wawrinka must try and rouse himself on his Australian Open farewell after a sapping five-set win in round two.\n\nMatches on outside courts remained suspended in the late afternoon, but organisers hoped they could get going again in the early evening.\n\nThe three courts with roofs resumed after a short delay to close them.\n\nEarlier, women's defending champion Madison Keys revelled in the scorching temperatures to set up a last-16 showdown with podcast co-host Jessica Pegula.\n\nMatches started an hour earlier than usual because of the heatwave, and Keys had no intention of hanging about.\n\nShe dismissed former world number one Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-3 in a statement victory.\n\nAfter admitting to being nervous and timid in embarking on her title defence, this was more like the Keys that stunned Aryna Sabalenka in the final a year ago.\n\nThe 30-year-old Keys said that being based in Florida meant she was well used to baking temperatures.\n\n\"I am feeling really good and I was excited for the heat today, and ready for it,\" she said.\n\nThe ninth seed faces good friend and compatriot Pegula for a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pegula powered past unseeded Russian Oksana Selekhmeteva 6-3, 6-2 in 66 minutes.\n\n\"Nice to be first out on court and not a super long match and didn't need to kill myself in the heat today,\" she said.\n\nPegula and Keys know each other well, even hosting a tennis podcast together.\n\nAnother title contender, Amanda Anisimova, made light work of fellow American Peyton Stearns 6-1, 6-4.\n\nMultiple major winners Iga Swiatek and Naomi Osaka also both feature on day seven at Melbourne Park.\n\nSerbian great Novak Djokovic faces 75th-ranked Dutchman Botic Van de Zandschulp for a place in the last 16.\n\nThe 38-year-old former world number one is in the evening prime time slot on Rod Laver Arena.\n\nDjokovic has looked in imperious form so far, yet to drop a set and striking a confident tone.\n\nDjokovic, who has been scaling back the number of matches he plays to wring the most out of his ageing body, said: \"It's all been positive so far, positive signs.\"\n\nLast up on centre court is two-time Melbourne Park champion Osaka, who wowed the crowds earlier this week when she emerged for her opening match in a jellyfish-themed outfit.\n\nOn court she has not been so dazzling and faces home hope Maddison Inglis, a qualifier.\n\nThe winner goes up against either six-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek or 31st-seeded Russian Anna Kalinskaya.\n\nSwiatek is aiming to complete the career Grand Slam of all four majors, with Australia the only one missing from her CV.",

    "description": "Researchers are report findings from study of 3.2-billion-year-old nitrogenases in Nature Communications.",
    "fullText": "Nitrogen, upon which all life on Earth depends, may hold the key for explaining how early life on the planet evolved and how it could evolve on other planets.\n\n“All living organisms need nitrogen to survive and, though it’s all around us, we can’t access it directly,” says Utah State University biochemist Lance Seefeldt. “Enzymes called nitrogenases enable nitrogen fixation, which converts nitrogen to a form plants, animals, humans and other life forms can access. And we’re just beginning to understand the extent to which, over the Earth’s four-billion-year history, these nitrogenases have evolved.”\n\nSeefeldt, with USU senior scientist Derek Harris and fellow colleagues with the NASA-funded Metal Utilization and Selection across Eons (MUSE) project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, report findings from a study using synthetic biology to reverse-engineer modern nitrogenases and rebuilt their possible ancestors in the Jan. 22, 2026 issue of the journal Nature Communications.\n\n“Our role in the study was to characterize a library of the synthetically reconstructed ancestral nitrogenase genes,” Harris says. “Under controlled lab conditions, we measured the nitrogen isotope fractionation in the cell biomass of the engineered strains.”\n\nSeefeldt, professor and head of USU’s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, has studied the structure and function of nitrogenases for more than three decades, says being able to reconstruct ancient nitrogenases represents a breakthrough in understanding the origins of life on Earth, as well as on other planets.\n\n“Until now, science has relied on ancient rock and fossils to study early life,” he says. “Our planet was vastly different billions of years ago. Modern microbes access atmospheric sources of nitrogen through nitrogenases, which are just one family of enzymes. Study of fossilized enzymes assumes ancient enzymes produced the same isotopic signatures as modern enzymes.”\n\nReconstructed nitrogenases, Seefeldt says, offer researchers a new window into what Earth and its atmosphere was like eons ago.\n\n“Understanding nitrogenases, both ancient and modern, is critical to helping us tackle current agricultural challenges in a changing climate, including areas at risk of famine due to drought and lack of access to commercial fertilizers,” he says.\n\nAdditionally, Seefeldt, who has collaborated on other NASA-funded projects, says the research fuels efforts to explore how to grow food in space and on Mars.\n\nBetül Kaçar, professor of bacteriology at the UW-Madison, director of the MUSE project and corresponding author on the paper, says study findings offer a sharper picture of how life persisted and evolved before oxygen-dependent organisms began reshaping the Earth.\n\n“The search for life starts here at home, and our home is four billion years old,” she says. “So, we need to understand our own past. We need to understand life before us, if we want to understand life ahead of us and life elsewhere.”\n\nElise Mahon, research communicator at UW-Madison, contributed to this story.\n\nMary-Ann Muffoletto\n\nCommunications Specialist\n\nCollege of Arts & Sciences\n\n 435-797-3517\n\n maryann.muffoletto@usu.edu\n\nLance Seefeldt\n\nProfessor and Head\n\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry\n\n 435-797-1619\n\n lance.seefeldt@usu.edu\n\nComments and questions regarding this article may be directed to the contact person listed on this page.",

    "fullText": "To beat the market in recent years, many investors applied a simple strategy: Load up on the biggest U.S. technology stocks.\n\nIt paid handsomely for a long time. But last year, it didn’t. For the first time since 2022, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, the majority of the Magnificent 7 tech giants performed worse than the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. While the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index rose 25% in 2025, compared with 16% for the S&P 500, that was only because of the enormous gains by Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp.\n\nMany Wall Street pros see that dynamic continuing in 2026, as profit growth slows and questions about payoffs from heavy artificial intelligence spending rise. So far they’ve been right, with the Magnificent 7 index up just 0.5% and the S&P 500 climbing 1.8% to start the year. Suddenly, stock picking within the group is crucial.\n\n“This isn’t a one-size-fits-all market,” said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, which has $1.4 trillion in assets. “If you’re just buying the group, the losers could offset the winners.”\n\nThe three-year bull market has been led by the tech giants, with Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. alone accounting for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gains since the run began in October 2022. But enthusiasm for them is cooling as interest in the rest of the S&P 500 rises.\n\nWith Big Tech’s earnings growth slowing, investors are no longer content with promises of AI riches — they want to start seeing a return. Profits for the Magnificent 7 are expected to climb about 18% in 2026, the slowest pace since 2022 and not much better than the 13% rise projected for the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“We’re already seeing a broadening of earnings growth and we think that’s going to continue,” said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tech is not the only game in town.”\n\nOne source of optimism is the group’s relatively subdued valuations. The Magnificent 7 index is priced at 29 times profits projected over the next 12 months, well below the 40s multiples earlier in the decade. The S&P 500 is trading at 22 times expected earnings, and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at 25 times.\n\nHere’s a look at expectations for the year ahead.\n\nThe dominant AI chipmaker is under pressure from rising competition and concerns about the sustainability of spending by its biggest customers. The stock is up 1,165% since the end of 2022, but it has lost 11% since its Oct. 29 record.\n\nRival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has won data center orders from OpenAI and Oracle Corp., and Nvidia customers like Alphabet are increasingly deploying their own custom made processors. Still, its sales continue to race ahead as demand for chips outstrips supply.\n\nWall Street is bullish, with 76 of the 82 analysts covering the chipmaker holding buy ratings. The average analyst price target implies a roughly 39% gain over the next 12 months, best among the group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFor Microsoft, 2025 was the second consecutive year it underperformed the S&P 500. One of the biggest AI spenders, it’s expected to invest nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures during its current fiscal year, which ends in June. That figure is projected to rise to $116 billion the following year, according to the average of analyst estimates.\n\nThe data center buildout is fueling a resurgence in revenue growth in Microsoft’s cloud-computing business, but the company hasn’t had as much success in getting customers to pay for the AI services infused into its software products. Investors want to start seeing returns on those investments, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\n“What you’re seeing is some people looking for a little bit more quality management in terms of that cash flow management and a better idea on what profitability really looks like when it comes to AI,” Mulberry said.\n\nApple has been far less aggressive with its AI ambitions than the rest of the Magnificent 7. The stock was punished for it last year, falling almost 20% through the start of August.\n\nBut then it caught on as an “anti-AI” play, soaring 34% through the end of the year as investors rewarded its lack of AI spending risk. At the same time, strong iPhone sales reassured investors that the company’s most important product remains in high demand.\n\nAccelerating growth will be the key for Apple shares this year. Its momentum has slowed recently, although the stock closed higher on Friday, narrowly avoiding matching its longest losing streak since 1991. However, revenue is expected to expand 9% in fiscal 2026, which ends in September, the fastest pace since 2021. With the stock valued at 31 times estimated earnings, the second highest in the Magnificent 7 after Tesla, it will need the push to keep the rally going.\n\nA year ago, OpenAI was seen as leading the AI race and investors feared Alphabet would get left behind. Today, Google’s parent is a consensus favorite, with dominant positions across the AI landscape.\n\nAlphabet’s latest Gemini AI model received rave reviews, easing concerns about OpenAI. And its tensor processing unit chips are considered a potential significant driver of future revenue growth, which could eat into Nvidia’s commanding share of the AI semiconductor market.\n\nThe stock rose more than 65% last year, the best performance in the Magnificent 7. But how much more can it run? The company is approaching $4 trillion in market value, and the shares trade at around 28 times estimated earnings, well above their five-year average of 20. The average analyst price target projects just a 3.9% gain this year.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud-computing giant was the weakest Magnificent 7 stock in 2025, its seventh straight year in that position. But Amazon has charged out of the gate in early 2026 and is leading the pack.\n\nMuch of the optimism surrounding the company is based on Amazon Web Services, which posted its fastest growth in years in the company’s most recent results. Concerns that AWS was falling behind its rivals has pressured the stock, as has the company’s aggressive AI spending, which includes efforts to improve efficiency at its warehouses, in part by using robotics. Investors expect the efficiency push to start paying off before long, which could make this the year the stock goes from laggard to leader.\n\n“Automation in warehouses and more efficient shipping will be huge,” said Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial, which owns Amazon shares. “It hasn’t gotten the love yet, but it reminds me of Alphabet last year, which was sort of left behind amid all the concerns about competition from OpenAI, then really took off.”\n\nPerhaps no stock in the group shows how investors have turned skeptical about lavish AI spending more than Meta. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has pushed expensive acquisitions and talent hires in pursuit of his AI ambitions, including a $14-billion investment in Scale AI in which Meta also hired the startup’s CEO Alexandr Wang to be its chief AI officer.\n\nThat strategy was fine with shareholders — until it wasn’t. The stock tumbled in late October after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $72 billion and projected “notably larger” spending in 2026. When the shares hit a record in August they were up 35% for the year, but they’ve since dropped 17%. Demonstrating how that spending is boosting profits will be critical for Meta in 2026.\n\nTesla’s shares were the worst performers in the Magnificent 7 through the first half of 2025, but then soared more than 40% in the second half as Chief Executive Elon Musk shifted focus from slumping electric vehicle sales to self-driving cars and robotics. The rally has Tesla’s valuation at almost 200 times estimated profits, making it the second most expensive stock in the S&P 500 behind takeover target Warner Bros. Discover Inc.\n\nAfter two years of stagnant revenue, Tesla is expected to start growing again in 2026. Revenue is projected to rise 12% this year and 18% next year, following an estimated 3% contraction in 2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStill, Wall Street is pessimistic about Tesla shares this year. The average analyst price target projects a 9.1% decline over the next 12 months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nWittenstein and Vlastelica write for Bloomberg.",

    "fullText": "Two malicious extensions in Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Marketplace that were collectively installed 1.5 million times exfiltrate developer data to China-based servers.\n\nBoth extensions are advertised as AI-based coding assistants that provide the promised functionality. However, they do not disclose the upload activity or ask users for consent to deliver data to a remote server.\n\nThe VS Code Marketplace is the official store for add-ons for Microsoft’s popular code editor. VS Code extensions are installable plugins from the marketplace that add features or integrate tools into the editor. One of the most popular add-on categories right now is AI-powered coding assistants.\n\nResearchers at endpoint and supply-chain security company Koi say that the two malicious extensions are part of a campaign they dubbed 'MaliciousCorgi' and share the same code for stealing developer data.\n\nAdditionally, both of them use the same spyware infrastructure and communicate with the same backend servers. At publishing time, both are present on the marketplace:\n\nThe extensions use three distinct data-collection mechanisms. The first involves real-time monitoring of files opened in the VS Code client. When a file is accessed, its entire contents are encoded in Base64 and transmitted to the attackers’ servers.\n\nAny changes to the opened file are also captured and exfiltrated.\n\n\"The moment you open any file – not interact with it, just open it – the extension reads its entire contents, encodes it as Base64, and sends it to a webview containing a hidden tracking iframe. Not 20 lines. The entire file,\"  Koi researchers say.\n\nThe second mechanism involves a server-controlled file-harvesting command that stealthily transmits up to 50 files from the victim’s workspace each time.\n\nThe third mechanism uses a zero-pixel iframe in the extension’s webview to load four commercial analytics SDKs: Zhuge.io, GrowingIO, TalkingData, and Baidu Analytics.\n\nThese SDKs are used to track user behavior, build identity profiles, fingerprint devices, and monitor activity inside the editor. So, while the first two collect developer work files, the third focuses on user profiling.\n\nKoi Security highlights the risks posed by undocumented functionality in these extensions, including the exposure of private source code, configuration files, cloud service credentials, and .env files containing API keys and credentials.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft about the presence of the two extensions on the VSCode market, but we are still waiting for a reply. We were unable to establish a communication channel with the publisher of the extensions.\n\nWhether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.\n\nGet the cheat sheet and take the guesswork out of secrets management.",

Some of the items standing out include more pixel format conversion work in WindowsCodecs, more work on ActiveX Data Objects \"MSADO\", and then various bug fixes.\r\nThere are 22 known bug fixes in Wine 11.1 ranging from addressing issues in Apple iTunes to GOG Galaxy to Microsoft Edge. Downloads and more details on the Wine 11.1 release via WineHQ.org.\n\n 4 Comments",

    "description": "Alexander Soofer was charged with pocketing $10 million in funding for the homeless and using it for personal luxuries like a house in Greece.",
    "fullText": "Authorities have found that some funding to combat homelessness in California has instead ended up in Greece.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has accused Alexander Soofer, manager of LA-based housing organization Abundant Blessing, of \"a years-long scheme to defraud the City and County of Los Angeles and other public entities providing funding for homeless housing.\"\n\nAccording to a complaint filed on Friday, while paying his staff \"minimal wages\" and feeding residents at his housing sites \"ramen noodles, canned beans, and breakfast bars,\" Soofer pocketed at least $10 million \"through bank accounts associated with other businesses in his and his wife's names\" for personal expenses after \"fraudulently obtaining\" $23 million in public funding.\n\nFederal officials said that between 2018 and 2025, Soofer's organization received more than $5 million directly from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority and over $17 million through other nonprofits.\n\nInvestigators found Soofer's misuse of funds includes $47,000 in luxury home purchases from stores like Restoration Hardware, $15,000 at Hermès, $15,000 at Chanel, $1,000 for cosmetic dermatology, and $4,500 for a four-night stay at the Wynn Las Vegas.\n\nAuthorities said they have yet to determine what Soofer bought at Chanel, but listed his purchases at Hermès as including a $1,250 pair of men's Paris calf-skin loafers, a $910 pair of women's Chypre sandals, a $455 Chevaux en Symetrie tie, and a $2,450 men's trotting jacket.\n\nIn addition to luxury brands, the complaint said there is at least one property under his name associated with the misappropriated funds. That property in question is located in Greece and relates to \"a $475,000 check issued from an Abundant Blessings bank account.\"\n\nThe case against Soofer feeds into concerns that California's efforts to combat homelessness may be ineffective and inconsistent despite large spending. According to the Public Policy Institute of California, as of 2024, the state had over 187,000 homeless people, representing about 24% of the nation's total.\n\nState Auditor Grant Parks wrote in a 2024 report to Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers that, when his department analyzed five housing programs that received approximately $13.7 billion in combined funding, only two were \"likely cost-effective.\"\n\nParks also added in the report that, between fiscal years 2018-2023, California cities lacked reliable data to track cost efficiency and outcomes needed to fully understand why the problem didn't improve, despite the billions spent by more than 30 housing programs.\n\nThe attorney's office of the Central District of California referred Business Insider to the press release and did not comment further. An attorney for Soofer and the Governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "This frequently requested feature is now available to a small set of beta testers via TestFlight. Here’s how it works.\n\nAs spotted by WABetaInfo, Meta rolled out a beta build of WhatsApp on TestFlight that lets group members choose whether to share recent chat history with a new member they just added, “up to 100 recent messages shared in the group over the last 14 days”.\n\nThe site also notes that “messages shared using this feature are highlighted in a different color, making them easier for new members to recognize in the conversation”.\n\nHaving access to past messages is a common and useful feature across many messaging platforms, helping new members get up to speed on recent discussions and access important information, depending on the context of the group chat.\n\nNow, WhatsApp is gearing up to roll this out, as select beta testers can already see the feature ahead of the broader rollout.\n\nHere’s WABetaInfo on what they found:\n\nTo check whether this feature is available, users must add a new member to the group. From the group chat info screen, users have to select the “Add Member” option. Once selected the member from the contacts list, the option to share recent messages may appear at the bottom of the screen. If it does, users can decide to share up to 100 messages, allowing the new member to quickly catch up on recent conversations. However, WhatsApp also allows users to select a smaller number of messages if they prefer to limit what is shared.\n\nThe site also notes that there is a transparency aspect to the feature, as it could be potentially misused by sharing the chat history unbeknownst to other participants:\n\nWhatsApp ensures transparency by letting everyone know that recent messages have been sent to the new member. To maintain clarity, WhatsApp adds a new message to the group chat, indicating the name of the user who shared the messages with the new group member. The sharing process uses the messages and encryption key on the device of the user who added the new member. Recent messages are again protected by end-to-end encryption and are securely delivered to the new member.\n\nAs is the case with most beta features, there isn’t a timeline for a wider rollout yet. But given that this is also being tested on Android, it probably won’t be too long until its official release.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - India will seek to triple the nation's exports by 2035 by boosting manufacturing through structural changes rather than with hefty spending, according to two government ​officials.\n\nIn Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third such attempt, the South Asian nation is prioritising manufacturing in 15 sectors, including ‌high-end semiconductors, metals and the labour-intensive leather industry, aiming to lift India's growth and boost annual goods exports to $1.3 trillion, they said.\n\nModi's government has twice failed to ‌double the share of manufacturing to 25% of gross domestic product - with a \"Make in India\" campaign in 2014 and a $23 billion package of incentives in 2020.\n\n\"In past years, several government initiatives to boost manufacturing growth have led to modest, incremental progress at best. What is needed is a bold, focused and cohesive strategy to drive transformative change,\" according to a government official involved in drafting the policy.\n\nMODEST FUNDING ⁠TO BE DECIDED BY GOVERNMENT PANEL\n\nThe government will ‌spend about 100 billion rupees ($1 billion) to build infrastructure for about 30 manufacturing hubs across the targeted sectors while providing grants of $218 million for advanced areas such as chips and energy storage, said ‍the officials, who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nThe Finance Ministry and government think tank NITI Aayog, which is tasked with preparing the policy, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFunding this time is modest as the plan focuses on easing ​regulatory and compliance burdens, the biggest impediment to Indian manufacturing, rather than doling out subsidies, the officials said.\n\nFinancial support to ‌industries will be decided case by case with recommendations from a new government panel to administrative departments, replacing the pre-budget fiscal packages of earlier schemes, they said.\n\nThe new structure, called the National Manufacturing Mission, was announced in the budget last year but details were not disclosed. Details could be announced in the budget on February 1, but that will be decided closer to the date, the officials said.\n\nThe panel's focus will be to ensure faster regulatory clearance, approvals for land and cheaper financing for ⁠large projects, the officials said. It will be chaired by a minister ​and composed of bureaucrats, including the cabinet secretary, they said.\n\nIt will oversee the ​building of manufacturing hubs for the 15 sectors, and work with state governments to assure steady and cheap electricity supplies for such units, the sources said.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAs Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor prepares to downsize from his 30-room home, Royal Lodge, sources are claiming that his imminent move to the Sandringham estate isn't necessarily going as planned. The former Duke of York was evicted from Royal Lodge in October after King Charles stripped his brother of his titles. Now, Andrew is set to move into a small property in Norfolk that's in need of significant renovations.\n\n\"He really didn't want Marsh Farm,\" a source told the Daily Mail. \"Andrew won't have lived anywhere that small since he left his apartment at Buckingham Palace—and then he had free roam of the building and grounds when he needed space.\" Per the outlet, it's understood that the former Duke of York would \"prefer\" Prince Philip's former residence, Wood Farm—a larger property on the Sandringham estate—but that idea was taken off the table as \"inappropriate.\"\n\nSince Marsh Farm isn't large enough to provide for live-in staff, the outlet reported that Andrew won't be able to bring any of his Royal Lodge staff with him. Instead, King Charles \"will provide a cleaner, a groundsman and a cook from Sandringham to look after Andrew's needs on an ad hoc basis.\"\n\nHowever, this arrangement \"hasn't gone down well\" with Andrew, the insider claimed, adding, \"nor has the lack of suitable garaging for Andrew's cars, although that may be dealt with during the refurbishment.\"\n\nAs the Sun reported last week, workers have been spotted at the property installing security cameras and fencing in preparation for the ex-prince's move. Moving vans have also been photographed coming and going at Royal Lodge, with reports indicating that Andrew and ex-wife Sarah Ferguson may be out by next weekend.\n\n\"He is trying to block it [the move] out,\" a source told the Daily Mail. \"His personal rooms have to be kept clear of any sign of packing cases. He is likely to move into temporary furnished accommodation provided by the King at Windsor or Sandringham as a stop-gap to spare him dealing with it all.\"\n\nInstead of going through his belongings himself, the insider claimed that \"a trusted member of staff is to be left behind to supervise the packing at the Lodge.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump gives. And he takes away.\n\nOffended by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's increasingly assertive posture toward the U.S., Trump revoked an invitation to join his Board of Peace. Many Western allies are suspicious of the organization, which is chaired by Trump and was initially formed to focus on maintaining the ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas but has grown into something skeptics fear could rival the United Nations.\n\nAppearing at the World Economic Forum, Trump spoke of imposing tariffs on Switzerland — which he ultimately lowered — because the country's leader “rubbed me the wrong way” during a phone call. Before shelving sweeping tariffs on multiple European countries, Trump pressed Denmark to “say yes” to the U.S. push to control Greenland “and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember,” he said, imperiling the NATO alliance.\n\nOver his decades in public life, Trump has never been one for niceties. But even by his standards, the tumult of the past week stood out because it crystallized his determination to erase the rules-based order that has governed U.S. foreign policy — and by extension most of the Western world — since World War II.\n\nThe president and his supporters have dismissed that approach as inefficient, overly focused on compromise and unresponsive to the needs of people contending with rapid economic change. But in its place, Trump is advancing a system that is poorly understood and could prove far less stable, driven by the whims of a single, often mercurial, leader who regularly demonstrates that personal flattery or animus can shape his decisions.\n\nReturning to the U.S. from Davos, home to the World Economic Forum, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said the phrase she heard “over and over” was that “we are entering this new world order” as she described a sense of confusion among allies.\n\n“It may be you just had a bad telephone call with the president and now you're going to have tariffs directed at you,” she told reporters. “This lack of stability and reliability, I think, is causing what were traditionally reliable trade partners to be saying to other countries, ‘Hey, maybe you and I should talk because I’m not sure about what’s going on with the United States.’”\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing is hardly surprising for someone who accepted his first Republican presidential nomination in 2016 by declaring that “I alone can fix” the nation's problems. As he settles into his second term with a far more confident demeanor than his first, he has delighted supporters with his to-the-victor -goes-the-spoils style.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former adviser, recently told the Atlantic that Trump is pursuing a “maximalist strategy” and that he must keep going “until you meet resistance.”\n\n“And we haven’t met any resistance,” Bannon said.\n\nThat's certainly true in Washington, where the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to check Trump's impulses. But leaders of other countries, who have spent much of Trump's administration trying to find ways to work with him, are increasingly vocal.\n\nCarney is quickly emerging as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. Speaking in Davos ahead of Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.”\n\n“In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact,” he continued. “We should not allow the rise of hard powers to blind us to the fact that the power of legitimacy, integrity, and rules will remain strong — if we choose to wield it together.”\n\nTrump did not take kindly to those remarks, responding with threats in Davos before yanking the Board of Peace invitation.\n\n“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said. “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nCarney, however, was unbowed, speaking of Canada as “an example to a world at sea” as he crafted a potential template for other world leaders navigating a new era.\n\n“We can show that another way is possible, that the arc of history isn’t destined to be warped toward authoritarianism and exclusion,” he said in a speech before a cabinet retreat in Quebec City.\n\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blasted Trump on Friday for “insulting and frankly appalling” comments in which he expressed doubt that NATO would support the U.S. if requested. The president seemingly ignored that the only time Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty, which requires all member countries to help another member under threat, was invoked was after the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.\n\nReferring to non-US troops, Trump told Fox Business Network, “You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.”\n\nStarmer, noting the 457 British personnel who died and those with life-long injuries, said he will “never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country.” Denmark, which Trump has belittled as “ungrateful” for U.S. protection during World War II, had the highest per capita death toll among coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nHis tactics have raised fears that Trump is imposing long-term damage on the U.S. standing in the world and encouraging countries to rethink their alliances and deepen their ties with China. Carney already traveled there earlier this month to meet with President Xi Jinping.\n\n“China’s leadership watched an American president fight with allies, insult world leaders, and engage in bizarre antics, and thought to themselves — this is nothing but good for us,” Jake Sullivan, former President Joe Biden's national security adviser, said in an email.\n\nThe administration is showing no sign of backing down. In a social media post referring to Canada's ties with Beijing, Trump said China “will eat them up.” And the Pentagon released a defense strategy late Friday telling allies to handle their own security.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, was in Davos and participated in a bipartisan delegation to Denmark with Murkowski that was intended to show unity amid Trump's bid for Greenland. Recalling his conversations with other leaders, he told reporters on Friday that Trump has shown he only backs down when countries like China “showed toughness and a resiliency.”\n\n“Those who were accommodating and who negotiated in good faith, like the EU, which did not impose retaliatory tariffs, seemed to have not won any of his respect,” Coons said. “They can reach their own conclusions, but it would seem to me that trying to find a way to accommodate him when the foundation of his demands about Greenland is unhinged … seem to me to suggest a course of action.”",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China is set to ramp up imports of Russian oil in January, absorbing barrels that would have previously gone to India ​and Turkey, as tougher Western sanctions force Moscow to redirect flows, LSEG data ‌and traders said.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed sweeping sanctions in late 2025 targeting Russian oil ‌sellers and shippers, including energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, complicating purchases for global buyers and tightening scrutiny on Russian crude exports.\n\nChina is poised to receive nearly 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil by sea this month, compared with 1.1 million bpd in December, according to ⁠preliminary LSEG data. Beijing, already ‌a key consumer of Russian Far East ESPO Blend, also boosted imports of Russian Urals oil to a record high of 405,000 bpd ‍in January, the highest since mid-2023, data provided by energy consultancy Kpler showed.\n\nIndia, previously the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea since the EU embargo on Moscow's oil in 2022, slashed purchases ​to below 1 million bpd in December, down from an average of 1.3 million ‌bpd last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep Russian oil imports near 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\n\nTurkey, also a major Russian oil buyer, reduced Urals imports in January to about 250,000 bpd, compared to an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the record 400,000 bpd reached in June ⁠last year.\n\n\"As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases ​recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,\" said ​a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus of Urals barrels weighed on prices.\n\nDiscounts for Urals crude delivered to China ‍in late 2025 widened ⁠to as much as $12 per barrel below ICE Brent for some cargoes, while current Urals differentials hover near minus $10 to the benchmark, according to two traders active ⁠in the Asian market.\n\nDemand for Urals in India and Turkey, both major exporters of diesel to Europe, slumped ‌due to the EU ban on fuels produced from Russian-origin crude, the ‌traders added.",

    "fullText": "The sun was still low on the horizon when 19-year-old Piper James walked toward the Pacific Ocean for a morning swim on an island whose name in the local language means “paradise.”\n\nWithin two hours, she was found dead, her body surrounded by dingoes, wild Australian native dogs that roam freely on K’gari, a national park famous for its natural beauty off the country’s eastern coast.\n\nIt’s not yet clear what caused the death of the Canadian backpacker, a young woman with an adventurous spirit, who had been working on the World Heritage-listed island for several weeks, fulfilling a long-held dream of visiting Australia.\n\nPreliminary autopsy results found evidence of drowning, but also dingo bites inflicted before and after she died. “Pre-mortem dingo bite marks are not likely to have caused immediate death,” the Queensland Coroner’s Court said in a statement.\n\n“Of course, we all want to believe it was drowning,” said her grieving father, Todd James. “It’s horrific, but maybe a little more peaceful than the alternative.”\n\nPathology tests to determine the cause of Piper’s death could take several weeks, but if dingoes are found to have played a significant role, it would be only the third fatal dingo attack in Australia in nearly 50 years – and the first involving an adult.\n\nIn 1980, a dingo infamously snatched baby Azaria Chamberlain from her parents’ tent in the Northern Territory. At that time, no one believed a dingo would take an infant and, despite her claims of innocence, the baby’s mother Lindy Chamberlain was jailed for murder. She was exonerated years later, when new evidence supported her story, inspiring a courtroom drama starring Meryl Streep.\n\nThe second fatality occurred in 2001, when 9-year-old Clinton Gage was mauled on K’gari, then called Fraser Island, by two dingoes who also attacked his younger brother.\n\n“That’s when we started to see the fences being put up around the townships and the resorts,” said George Seymour, mayor of the Fraser Coast region that includes K’gari.\n\nIn the days afterward, more than 30 dingoes on the island were “humanely destroyed,” a decision that prompted public outcry.\n\nA possible third fatality has put some in the community on edge. Not because of any change in the perceived risk – which they know well – but because they fear it could drive calls for another cull.\n\nJames said if dingoes are ultimately found to be responsible, Piper would not have supported a cull. “We want no harm done to any animals over this, because Piper would not want that number one, and would be devastated to be any part of that,” he said.\n\nVisitors to K’gari are warned of the risks, but James says young foreign nationals like his daughter, who work on the island, need firmer guardrails. Piper had told her parents that dingoes looked “cute.”\n\n“They look like her dog from home,” said James.\n\n“Those dogs, I said, ‘You don’t touch them. You can’t touch them.’ And she’s like ‘I know.’”\n\nAround half a million people visit K’gari every year for its white-sand beaches, sparkling blue lakes and native wildlife – including dingoes, or wongari, as they’re known in the local Aboriginal language.\n\nUp to 200 dingoes roam the island, and while they look similar to their relatives on the mainland, their isolation from domestic and feral dogs means they have some of the purest dingo DNA. To Australia, their conservation is considered an issue of “national significance.”\n\nWhile dingoes are treasured, they’re also acknowledged as dangerous.\n\nVisitors to K’gari are warned to stay at least 20 meters from the animals, travel in groups, and keep children within arm’s reach. “Dingo sticks” are provided to ward off those that get too close.\n\n“Dingoes see people as a source of food, and that’s the issue, not people themselves,” said Ben Allen, a wildlife biologist who works for Ecosure, an environmental consultancy that did the last major review of dingoes on K’gari in 2012, though smaller ones have followed.\n\n“Over here, they sort of jokingly call it seagull syndrome, where you give a seagull a chip and then it wants the whole hamburger,” said Allen. “Well, these seagulls have got four feet and teeth, so you don’t really want to be feeding them a chip, because when it comes to ask for the whole hamburger, you can have problems.”\n\nTourists are urged to lock up their food and trash, and anglers instructed to bury any bait that may attract scavengers. Hefty fines are issued for anyone who feeds them or is seen to be encouraging their presence. Information guides warn visitors not to run, as dingoes will give chase.\n\n“In the past, we’ve told people that if you’re on the beach and you’re being stalked, you should go into the water,” said Seymour, the local mayor.\n\nHowever, that advice changed after recent attacks – including two in 2023, when a 10-year-old boy was dragged underwater by a dingo before his sister stepped in, and when a woman was attacked despite running into the surf to escape four dingoes. She was pulled from the water by two men and treated for serious injuries to her legs and arms.\n\n“I’ve been saying for a couple of years that there is a risk of a fatality,” said Seymour.\n\nOn the morning of her death, Piper James had gone for a swim alone on the beach near the rusty hull of the Maheno shipwreck, a local landmark that washed ashore in a cyclone almost 100 years ago. No one knows what happened next.\n\n“We don’t know if she actually went in the water,” said her father, Todd. “If she did go in, there’s a good chance she drowned. She was a strong swimmer … But good swimmers get taken away all the time.”\n\nSwimming is not advised on the island’s unpatrolled beaches and strong ocean currents are considered hazardous, especially along the eastern coast. Strong winds on Monday whipped up eight-foot (2.5-meter) waves, according to one resident, who lives nearby.\n\nIt’s possible James got into trouble in the surf before dingoes entered the picture.\n\nJames knows his daughter didn’t take a dingo stick with her – because she didn’t think she’d need it.\n\n“Piper should not have gone. She made that decision to go. I just wish she’d maybe taken a stick, or not have gone at all. She shouldn’t have gone alone, that’s the bottom line.”\n\nJames said Piper loved Byron Bay and Bondi Beach – other popular Australian destinations for beach-loving tourists – but K’gari was a “next-level kind of experience.”\n\nScott Bell, the secretary of the Happy Valley Community Association on K’gari, has been visiting the island on and off since the 1960s, and understands its appeal.\n\n“It’s a magical sort of place,” he said. “It is a wilderness area. And in that environment, there are a lot of dangers, be they sharks, snakes, spiders or dingoes.”\n\nBell said his time on the island has taught him to stand up to dingoes. “You stand tall, they see a large animal there, and they tend to run away,” said Bell. Children are particularly vulnerable due to their smaller size and natural reaction when scared.\n\n“Kids tend to run… That’s probably the worst thing you can do. Turn your back on a predator running, be it a lion, tiger, bear, you know you’re in trouble,” he said.\n\nBell said that, until the cause of James’ death is confirmed, it’s too early to decide what should be done. He said rangers are working hard to manage the risks – but for as long as humans and dingoes share the island, that risk will never truly go away.\n\nThe land’s traditional custodians, the Butchulla people, have a culturally significant bond with the island’s dingoes, stretching back thousands of years. They have long called for caps on visitor numbers, especially during the dingoes’ breeding season from March to May, to lower the risk.\n\n“Everyone should enjoy K’gari, but they need to come when it is not the breeding season,” Christine Royan, director of the Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation, told local media.\n\n“The solution is not to blame or punish the animal,” she added. “We’re going to fight anybody that wants to remove the wongari from K’Gari.”\n\nQueensland’s state premier has ruled out a cap on visitor numbers and says any formal response will come after the full results of the autopsy. Seymour has called for children to be banned from camping outside fenced areas.\n\n“If the government has to tell you to keep your children within arm’s length – that is not why people go camping. People go camping to feel free to be there within nature. I just don’t think it’s suitable for children to be camping in the unfenced areas,” he said.\n\nPiper’s father agrees that children are at risk – especially those who camp outside fenced areas.\n\n“You cannot leave people exposed and children exposed and let parents think that it’s not going to happen to them, because we thought it wouldn’t happen to Piper.”\n\nOver the years, individual dingoes deemed too habituated to humans have been euthanized, in consultation with the Butchulla people. It’s not a measure taken lightly and only occurs after specific dingoes pose a repeated threat to visitors’ safety.\n\nAllen, from Ecosure, says annual turnover in dingo populations is quite high – about two thirds of the island’s dingoes die naturally each year. “Not every pup can survive when you’re stuck on an island,” he said.\n\nThe population typically peaks between December and February, when pups are learning to become independent. “It’s not uncommon for this time of year to see the larger group sizes, which coincides with summer when everybody in Australia is at the beach,” he said.\n\nIn some ways, Australia’s challenge with dingoes is not dissimilar to issues elsewhere, for example Japan’s attempts to hold bears at bay, or India’s problem with lions.\n\nHowever, the dingo population is not growing – it’s people who are becoming more common, bringing carloads of food for family trips, and driving up and down the beach where dingoes would typically hunt.\n\nTo some, they may look like small domestic dogs, but they’re unpredictable and wild. And just as tourists are urged to stay away from large predators in other nations, they need to keep their distance from dingoes, no matter how harmless they may seem.\n\n“If I travel to Kruger National Park in South Africa and wanted to go for a walk, I can accept a certain level of risk. I might get eaten by a lion or stomped on by an elephant,” said Allen.\n\n“If I do the same in Chitwan in Nepal, which is a beautiful national park, I’ve got to put up with tigers and leopards and elephants there, too.\n\n“We don’t have lions and tigers and bears, but we’ve got dingoes and kangaroos and lots of venomous snakes and all that kind of thing. There’s just inherent risks with being out in nature.”\n\nThe James family plans to travel to K’gari in the coming weeks to attend a smoking ceremony as guests of the island’s traditional custodians. The ancient ritual will see smoke from smoldering native leaves waft over the island’s sandy beaches – to cleanse, and to heal.\n\nJames wants more to change as a result of his daughter’s death – to force a change in rules and culture, so there are more guardrails around children and young travelers, like Piper, who are strong and independent but don’t necessarily have the life experience to fully appreciate the dangers.\n\n“Maybe more education with Piper would help, because when you’re put on the tour, you’re educated, and then you’re protected, and then you feel safe,” he said. “Then you’re left alone and things are a little different than the tour.”",

Doctors performed CPR for over 40 minutes.\n\nThe dog was found earlier this week at East Bayfront and Broad Street.\n\nHowever, Erie police have arrested two people in connection with the cruelty case.\n\n“They had brought it in and stated that they had found the dog. When they came in the next day, when requested, they admitted, the female admitted it was their dog and they weren’t able to take care of it but this animal needlessly suffered there are more than enough agencies that are out there that will take animals in,” said Rick Lorah, Erie chief of police.\n\nANNA Shelter provides update on puppy found under bridge\n\nCriminal complaints identified the suspects as 23-year-old Scott Bayle and 26-year-old Tori Jackna.\n\nRuth Thompson of the ANNA Shelter said that receiving news of the arrest was bittersweet because while justice was served, a life was lost.\n\nIf you have a pet that you are struggling to take care of, erie police, and the ANNA Shelter team said that they are willing to help and surrendering a pet before it’s too late is always an option.",

    "fullText": "GLENDALE – Despite the team’s poor record, the Arizona Cardinals 2025 draft class played extraordinary well. Many of the rookies were thrusted into position far too soon because of injuries, and in a sink or swim environment, a majority swam. First-round pick Walter Nolen had one of the highest PFF grades in the NFL, while second-round pick Will Johnson was a lockdown corner for the team.\n\nFourth-rounder Cody Simon took on the role of green dot and did wonderfully, while the utter surprise arrival of fifth-rounder Denzel Burke was sensational. All four played a critical role of last year’s team, and as the franchise heads into 2026, which of these names will have an even bigger impact in Year 2.\n\nWith Nolen likely to miss time due to injury and Simon to have his role shrinked when Mack Wilson Sr. returns, it looks to be a two-horse race between Burke and Johnson.\n\nAug 9, 2025; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Arizona Cardinals cornerback Will Johnson (0) against the Kansas City Chiefs during a preseason NFL game at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\n“Burke’s rookie season was a roller coaster. The fifth-round pick was asked to handle a heavy workload, and despite that responsibility, he allowed just three touchdowns — with two coming against Ja’Marr Chase and Puka Nacua,” Pro Football Focus writer Zach Tantillo wrote. “He surrendered more than 25 receiving yards to only three wide receivers all year and recorded three interceptions to lead all rookie cornerbacks.”\n\nAug 9, 2025; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Arizona Cardinals cornerback Denzel Burke (29) against the Kansas City Chiefs during a preseason NFL game at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nBurke was arguably the best rookie defensive back in the NFL last year. The former Ohio State Buckeye had three interceptions and 11 pass deflections. Regardless of the injuries, the 23-year-old played himself into a starting role towards the end of the season. Even when the roster will be healthy, Burke will be on the field.\n\nJohnson was seen as the steal of the 2025 draft on the night. A fringe top-10 player that dropped to 47th overall to the Cardinals. The 22-year-old fell due to injury concerns, which did plague him in his rookie year. The first half of the season was rough, playing in five of the team’s first 12 games. However, he closed the season strong by playing in Arizona’s final six game.\n\nIn 12 games, Johnson had nine pass breakups, which was 12th in the NFL. He failed to record an interception in his first year, but came close many times throughout his appearances.\n\nNov 3, 2025; Arlington, Texas, USA; Arizona Cardinals cornerback Will Johnson (0) celebrates as he leaves the field after defeating the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-Imagn Images\n\nThe duo cornerbacks each showed amazing potential, but Johnson has the chance to take the biggest leap because of being sidelined by injuries for half of the year. Burke was a pleasant surprise, but one has to worry about the sophomore slump of a cornerback that overachieved. Johnson is the safer pick to have a healthier Year 2 and live up to his pre-draft comparisons.\n\nThe Cardinals secondary is filled with players like Garrett Williams and Max Melton that will get snaps. When healthy, Johnson will likely be the one getting more snaps. Burke played in 17 games but only had two games playing 100% of the defensive snaps, while Johnson had five instances.\n\nCardinals remain lone team interested in Raheem Morris for head coach position in 2026",

    "fullText": "Club América is close to finalizing what would be the most high-profile signing of the Clausura 2026. After intense negotiations, Las Águilas have reportedly reached a verbal agreement with Palmeiras for the Brazilian midfielder Raphael Veiga. The deal, which was unlocked thanks to the mediation of the coaching staff, is shaping up to be a loan with a mandatory purchase for next year.\n\nAlthough the official figures remain confidential, the total amount of the transfer would be around 10 million dollars. If completed, Veiga would become one of the highest-paid players on the azulcrema squad, with an estimated annual salary of 2.7 million dollars, which would be fully covered by the Coapa institution.\n\nDespite progress in Brazil, América faces an administrative problem: there are no available slots for Non-Mexican Trained Players (NFM). To register Veiga, the board is working against the clock to facilitate the departure of a foreign player, with two names on the table:\n\nVíctor Dávila: The Chilean is the main candidate to leave due to his inconsistent performance (9 goals in 4 tournaments), although his high salary complicates a return to his home country.\n\nJosé \"Pantera\" Zúñiga: A more viable exit option if a move within Liga MX can be arranged.\n\nIf the slots are freed up in the next few hours, the Brazilian star would travel to Mexico City this weekend to undergo medical exams and sign the contract that would officially link him with the current champion.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The world of football witnessed another curious episode last Thursday (22).\n\nCoach Lúcio Flávio, who had arrived at Goiatuba with hopes of reviving the team in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano, requested to leave the club after leading the squad for just one round (four days of work).\n\nThe 46-year-old coach released a video announcing his departure and stating that he had accepted a new job offer — he was announced at Uberlândia, in Minas Gerais.\n\nA former midfielder who emerged at Paraná in the late 1990s, Lúcio Flávio played for major clubs in Brazilian football, such as Internacional, São Paulo, Coritiba, Atlético-MG, Vitória, and Santos.\n\nHowever, the club with which he is most closely identified is Botafogo, where he played between 2007 and 2008 and then again from 2009 to 2010.\n\nRetired from the pitch since 2017, Lúcio Flávio began his coaching career as an assistant at Paraná the following year.\n\nHe later served as assistant and interim coach at Botafogo between 2020 and 2023. The young coach also had stints at Aparecidense, São Joseense, and Brasiliense before arriving at Goiatuba at the start of the Goianão.\n\nAt Goiatuba, the team’s situation in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano was already difficult before Lúcio Flávio’s arrival.\n\nThe “Azulão do Sul” started the state championship with another coach, Augusto Fassina, who was dismissed after three winless matches.\n\nLúcio Flávio led the team in just one match, and with only one point on the table, the club remains at the bottom of the competition. The team still has four games ahead to try to escape relegation and dream of a spot among the top eight in the state championship.\n\nMeanwhile, Uberlândia is also going through a tough time. Before the coach’s arrival, the “Verdão” had two losses and two draws in four matches, sitting at the bottom of Group A in the Campeonato Mineiro.\n\nIn four games, the team has yet to win, suffered a 5-0 thrashing by Cruzeiro, and faces challenges ahead as they try to climb out of last place in their group in the state championship.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Here's everything you need to know about the adrenaline trip that will be \"Skyscraper Live\" on Netflix",
    "fullText": "Calling all adrenaline junkies, Netflix has a broadcast specifically for you this week. Well, it’s specifically for adrenaline junkies who are probably not also stressed out by heights.\n\nOn Friday, professional climber Alex Honnold will be scaling his next mountain — except it’s not a mountain. Instead, he’ll be free-climbing a literal skyscraper, and yes, free-climbing means exactly what you think it does. He’ll have no ropes or harnesses attached, no safety nets to land in, he’s just…climbing a building.\n\nThe climb will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Netflix, on Friday, Jan. 23. It will be streamed live, so you can see the whole thing.\n\nAlex Hannold is a professional rock climber, who you might recognize from the documentary “Free Solo.” He’s a veteran at climbing.\n\nHannold will be scaling Taipei 101, one of the tallest buildings in the world. As you likely guessed from its name, the building is in Taiwan.\n\nIn total, Taipei 101 has, well, 101 stories. It’s 1,667 feet tall.\n\nIn Hannold’s own words: “Why not?” According to the climber, the building is “possible, which a lot of skyscrapers aren’t — it’s uniquely suited for climbing.”\n\nIt appears not. Hannold will truly solo climb and he admitted to Tudum himself that “My life is on the line.”\n\nAccording to Hannold himself, if something goes wrong, he’ll probably die, as he explained to CNN during a recent sit-down interview. However, as he noted, with this particular building, there are a lot of balconies spread out accross a long stretch of the climb “The geometry of the building, the shape of the building is such that you actually could fall in tons of places and not actually die,” Hannold described, “which makes it in some ways safer than a lot of rock-climbing objectives.”\n\nIn the same interview, Hannold described it as a low-risk, high-consequence activity — meaning that, most likely, he’ll incur no injury at all, but if something goes wrong, the stakes are extremely high. In contrast, he describes sports football as high-risk, lower-consequence, since athletes regularly have career-ending, but not life-ending, accidents on the field.\n\nProducers have also clarified that there will be a 10-second delay, and if the worst should happen, they will cut away.\n\nThe post ‘Skyscraper Live’: Where to Watch, Who’s Climbing and What Happens If He Falls appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Falcons listed as best landing spot for Super Bowl-winning quarterback originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe quarterback position in Atlanta is a bit up in the air right now. Michael Penix is the team’s QB of the future, but he might not be ready for the start of the 2026 season after suffering a torn ACL in November.\n\nThe Falcons also have veteran Kirk Cousins on the roster, but they could look to release him in a cost-cutting move in the coming weeks.\n\nIf they do move on from Cousins, they would need to identify another quarterback who could potentially serve as a starter in Penix’s absence and then shift to a reserve role. That’s where Joe Flacco could come in.\n\nIn a recent article, Kristopher Knox of Bleacher Report listed the Falcons as the best landing spot for Flacco, citing his relationship with new head coach Kevin Stefanski and ability to effectively operate as a fill-in starter.\n\n“If the Falcons don't retain Cousins as veteran insurance, Flacco would be the perfect alternative. Stefanski and Flacco helped take the Browns to the playoffs in 2023, and the pair could likely get Atlanta off to a hot start if Penix isn't ready to go when the season opens,” Knox wrote.\n\n“The Falcons don't quite have the receiving corps that the Bengals have, but Flacco would probably find success alongside Drake London, Bijan Robinson, and Kyle Pitts—assuming Pitts is retained in free agency.”\n\nFlacco would certainly be cheaper than Cousins, and even thought he’s 41 years old, he’s demonstrated that he can still run an offense at a high level.\n\nIn 13 games – and 10 starts – split between Cleveland and Cincinnati last season, Flacco threw for 2,479 yards and 13 touchdowns, compared to just four interceptions.\n\nFirst, the Falcons have to figure out what they want to do with Cousins. If they do decide to move on from him, Flacco could actually make a lot of sense as a replacement.\n\nCarolina Panthers predicted to land top edge rusher in free agency\n\nBaltimore Ravens predicted to cut ties with All-Pro defender\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles predicted to make quarterback trade over offseason\n\nPittsburgh Steelers urged to avoid veteran quarterback in free agency",

    "fullText": "Trinity Rodman has been called a generational talent. Not necessarily because she is the best in the world — three-time Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmati is still at the top of that list — but because of what she offers as a whole.\n\nFrom her signature, defense-splitting “Trin Spin” move on the field to her entertaining and profitable presence off it, keeping Rodman in the National Women’s Soccer League was so crucial to the current trajectory of women’s soccer in America that the league changed its rules to ensure it happened.\n\nThe reality is that Rodman could have walked away. The 23-year-old’s previous contract with the Washington Spirit ended on Dec. 31. She had options from Europe, including from Chelsea, which has been willing to splash some cash on U.S. players. But she stuck it out with her team and her city, even after a previous agreement vetoed by the league sparked arguments about the NWSL’s salary-cap rules.\n\nRodman was rewarded for that loyalty with one of the biggest salaries in women’s soccer history. She will take home more than $2 million a year for the next three years, benefitting from a change in league rules to allow such spending.\n\n“Getting drafted here and developing and maturing and learning and failing at Spirit and in D.C., it’s become so much of my legacy and my story. But on top of that, I still feel like there’s so much more I have to give and so much more that I want to do,” Rodman said during her contract signing ceremony on Thursday.\n\nMany will claim credit for finally ending the mind-boggling saga around keeping the superstar in the league, but the rich soccer community in Washington, D.C., should not go overlooked. Thursday was a welcome reminder of the anomaly that is women’s soccer, where the love of the game can still sometimes outweigh balance sheets.\n\nOwner Michele Kang’s willingness to pay a player what she’s worth and Rodman’s persistence in demanding nothing less were only successful when paired with the growing relationship between the team and its fans.\n\nTo understand how that connection became so strong — and how it might be emulated elsewhere — you have to go back to the beginning.\n\nThe Spirit selected Rodman No. 2 in the 2021 draft. At the time, Kang, who now owns professional women’s teams on three continents, was only a minority investor. While there was plenty of excitement around the young prospect, whose surname was already synonymous with championships in another sport thanks to her father, soccer took a backseat to off-field issues months ahead of the postseason.\n\nIn September 2021, the Spirit fired head coach Richie Burke following allegations of emotional and verbal harassment. Shortly after, the Spirit had to forfeit two games for violating the league’s COVID-19 policy. Majority owner Steve Baldwin, who was accused of allowing Burke to quietly step away rather than force a more public vetting of the allegations surrounding his coach, battled with Kang for control of the team. Kang called for Baldwin to step down and sell his shares to her.\n\nWithout protection from the front office, the drama seeped into the players’ day-to-day work, and they eventually called for Baldwin to sell his stake in the team to Kang. Following the COVID forfeits, the team lost just twice in the last 13 games and won the club’s first NWSL Championship. Rodman, for her part, won rookie of the year.\n\nBaldwin eventually agreed to sell for $35 million, more than seven times the team’s valuation at the time. However, it wasn’t until March 30, 2022, that Kang was finally able to gain control of the club.\n\nLeaders such as midfielder Andi Sullivan and goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury, who consistently fielded questions about the off-field obstacles, are still key parts of the team’s leadership in 2026. That matters. The fans who stuck by the players matter, too.\n\nThe Spirit’s home, Audi Field, has earned the name “Rowdy Audi” after three seasons of record attendance, which reached an average of 10,866 in 2023, 13,940 in 2024 and 15,110 in 2025. With sellouts becoming commonplace, it’s easy to forget that before 2023, the Spirit spent many home games at small venues more than an hour outside the city, sometimes with less than 10,000-seat capacity.\n\n“The fan base, the stadium, you can’t (compare) — even other NWSL teams (don’t) get these amount of fans,” Rodman said. “I feel it, and you see it with all the interactions I have. I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”\n\nIn 2021, the players rallied around each other, and the fans rallied around the players. In 2025, that support has grown by the thousands. Rodman is without a doubt part of that growth, and she bears that responsibility openly.\n\nAfter the Spirit defeated Racing Louisville in the 2025 NWSL quarterfinals, Rodman sprinted to the wall of supporters to celebrate. It had been her first game back since a minor MCL sprain kept her out of the previous playoff match and regular-season finale. Likely to the dismay of a nearby athletic trainer, Rodman hopped into the stands alongside teammate Esme Morgan and waved the supporters’ massive flag to erupting cheers. She made a similar show of respect after the team’s semifinal win over the Portland Thorns, their final home game of the season. The win helped Washington reach its second final in as many years.\n\nThat moment illustrated the importance of the community the Spirit have created.\n\nFive years ago, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe were the names synonymous with soccer in America and women’s soccer as a whole. Now, Rodman has taken that crown, even if she spent much of last year sidelined by injuries. In all, she played 17 games and scored five goals. Yet when she came on the field in the NWSL Championship, PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. reached its loudest decibel level of the night.\n\nThe 23-year-old Olympic gold medalist has endured seven club coaches, multiple home venues and new ownership. Throughout it all, she’s helped build a soccer power.\n\nKang and other team executives made clear last Thursday how much those fans matter. They brought up an elementary school student and Spirit supporter named Emma to deliver Rodman’s new contract. Rodman embraced Emma — and her pink box braids that mirrored Rodman’s iconic look from the 2024 Olympics — and talked about how she wants to use her extended time with the Spirit to give back to the youth in D.C.\n\nCynically, it could be seen as a marketing move to sell more tickets. With private equity and skyrocketing valuations becoming a bigger part of the women’s game, not every gesture can be taken at face value. Kang, who owns London City Lioness in England and OL Lyonnes in France, is among the owners whose motives have been questioned. Women’s soccer has gone overlooked and mistreated for so long that scar tissue remains.\n\nHowever, Thursday showed what happens when the community aspect of women’s soccer is not just embraced, but invested in.\n\n“I can’t think about the Washington Spirit without her,” Kang said. “I hope she can’t think about her career without Washington Spirit.”\n\nRodman could have walked away. Instead, she made it abundantly clear that she wanted to stay, for the team, the fans and herself.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nUS Women's national team, Washington Spirit, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "LA QUINTA, CA — All the talk of playing in the Bahamas and private flights across the country and late-night fast-food runs faded under the brilliance of a Southern California day and the talent of Blades Brown on Friday, Jan. 23.\n\nBrown, who made his professional debut at 17 years old last year at The American Express, fired a 12-under 60 on the Nicklaus Tournament Course at PGA West in the second round of the PGA Tour event at the La Quinta Country Club. It was the lowest round in the PGA Tour by an 18-year-old since 1983.\n\nBrown, seeking an historic 59, parred the final three holes including a 7-foot putt on his final hole that rolled agonizingly wide right.\n\n\"I saw my spot just a little before the hole. I got a great read off David Ford,\" Brown said of his final putt for 59. \"He dripped it in there and it went right dead center. So I was thinking, okay, maybe just a little outside right edge. Unfortunately, it didn't break, but it's all right. I'm not worried about it.\"\n\nAs he watched his putt sail right, Brown looked to the heavens in disappointment as a large gallery groaned, obviously aware of the moment and wanting to be a part of history. But the smile returned to his face moments later after tapping in his par, for a course record and stamping himself as a rising star in the sport.\n\nLEADERBOARD: Full results from The American Express\n\n\"I just really like this golf course. There's something about the Nicklaus Course that I just really like,\" said Brown, who shot 64 on the course in 2025 including a run of six consecutive birdies. \"Like, it's so money. It's so pure. Everything is just perfectly well-kempt. I love playing with no wind. So when you put all those things together it's fun.\"\n\nHe was bidding for the 16th sub-60 round in PGA Tour history and the third ever shot at the desert's PGA event.\n\nBrown, a member of the Korn Ferry Tour and in the field this week on a sponsor's exemption, shares the 36-hole lead in the tournament at 17-under, with world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. Scheffler, playing four groups ahead of Brown, fired a 64 on the Nicklaus course. Si Woo Kim fired a 65 on the Pete Dye Stadium Course, the toughest of the three courses in the rotation, and is alone in third at 16 under.\n\nBrown wasn't the only player to make it to the 18th hole with a shot at a 59 on Friday. Andrew Putnam, playing at La Quinta Country Club, had a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole, but missed and had to settle for a fantastic 12-under 60 to tie the course record.\n\nBrown began his day on the 10th hole at the Nicklaus course and birdied the first hole, followed by an eagle on the par-5 11th. Brown then made five consecutive birdies to reach 8 under through seven holes before making three consecutive pars.\n\nBut starting on the second hole on the front nine (his back), Brown regained his torrid scoring touch, with four birdies in his next five holes to get to 12 under for the day. He managed just a par on the par-5 seventh hole, then missed makeable birdie putts on the eighth and ninth hole which would've given him a magical 59.\n\nBrown or Putnam would've been the third golfer shoot 59 at The American Express. David Duval shot the number in the final round of the 1999 tournament on the Palmer Course at PGA West to win the tournament. Adam Hadwin shot 59 in the third round of the 2017 event at La Quinta Country Club, but Hadwin ended up second that week behind Hudson Swafford.\n\nBrown's fantastic round comes just two days after he finish play in the Korn Ferry Tour event in the Bahamas, where Brown finished tied for 17th. Brown took a private jet for six hours to get to the Southern California desert late Wednesday night, hit fast-foot restaurant Panda Express, went to a grocery store and then went to sleep before his 9:58 a.m. tee time Thursday. Brown shot 5-under 67 at La Quinta Country Club to open the event.\n\nPutnam's round at La Quinta Country Clubs starter slower than Brown's with just one birdie in his first three holes. But Putnam, 36 and with one PGA Tour victory, rattled off six consecutive birdies and capped that run with an eagle on the par-5 11th to get to 9-under for the day. He added two birdies at 13 and 14 and another at 17 to reach 12 under before making the long two-putt for a par on the 18th hole.\n\nThe 60 moved Putnam to 12 under for the tournament, tied for 18th in a week where low scoring seems to be at a record pace. The two 60s even overshadowed Scheffler, the No. 1 player in the world who cruised to a 64 for his second consecutive bogey-free round in his first tournament of the year. One of the players to have shot 59 in an event back in 2020, Scheffler said he wouldn't have been too surprised had the day produced two 59s.\n\n\"The courses are in good shape, you've got good weather conditions, I think that's a recipe for some low scores when you got guys with the amount of talent that we have out here on tour,\" Scheffler said. \"I think when you get those two things together you're going to see some low scores.\"\n\nBoth Scheffler and Brown will move to the Stadium Course for the third round Saturday. Brown was in contention to make the cut in the 2025 American Express but a third-round 74 on the Stadium Course moved him outside of the cut line in his pro debut.\n\n\"(Saturday) obviously the Stadium Course is the more difficult of the three golf courses,\" Brown said. \"I haven't played it yet (this year), so I'm just going to go see where I can hit it down the fairway, hit it on the green, and try to make a putt.\"\n\nThe idea of a Sunday final group including Scheffler and Brown is tantalizing. Scheffler says he only knows a little bit of Brown's story and does not know Brown personally.\n\n\"These kids coming out, they know they got to come out and make some birdies. I think when you're coming out young you don't have as much scar tissue as the guys that are a little bit more seasoned, and you just come out, and if you want to make a name for yourself you got to put up some good scores,\" Scheffler said. \"It sounds like an 18-year-old shooting 59 is a pretty good start to his career there.\"\n\nBrown said he'd love the chance to play with the world's No. 1.\n\n\"I think that would be awesome, yeah. Scottie is an unbelievable golfer,\" Brown said. \"I'd try to learn from him as much as I can the way he plays the golf course. There's a lot of strategy in his game, and he's obviously an unbelievable ball-striker. So it's really cool watching him play some golf.\"\n\nJake Knapp (59): 2025 Cognizant Classic (Round 1)\n\nHayden Springs (59): 2024 John Deere Classic (Round 1)\n\nCameron Young (59): 2024 Travelers Championship (Round 3)\n\nScottie Scheffler (59): 2020 The Northern Trust (Round 2)\n\nKevin Chappell (59): 2019 Military Tribute at the Greenbrier (Round 2)\n\nBrandt Snedeker (59): 2018 Wyndam Championship (Round 1)\n\nAdam Hadwin (59): 2017 Career Builder Challenge (Round 3)\n\nJustin Thomas (59): 2017 Sony Open (Round 1)\n\nJim Furyk (58): 2016 Travelers Championship (Round 2)\n\nJim Furyk (59): 2013 BMW Championship (Round 2)\n\nStuart Appleby (59): 2010 Greenbrier Classic (Round 4)\n\nPaul Goydos (59): 2010 John Deere Classic (Round 1)\n\nDavid Duval (59): 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic (Round 4)\n\nChip Beck (59): 1991 Las Vegas Invitational (Round 3)\n\nAl Geiberger (59): 1977 Memphis Classic (Round 2)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Springs Desert Sun: Blades Brown shoots 60 in Round 2 of American Express PGA Tour event",

    "fullText": "Teenager Blades Brown fired a spectacular 12-under par 60 to join world number one Scottie Scheffler atop the leaderboard after two rounds of the PGA Tour American Express in La Quinta, California, on Friday.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Tennessee just missed out on a 59 when his birdie putt at his final hole slipped by on the right side.\n\n\"I'm so stoked to have shot 60 on the PGA Tour,\" Brown said, acknowledging that nerves \"absolutely\" kicked in over the final three holes.\n\nHe had made a dazzling start on the Nicklaus Tournament course, one of three in use over the first three rounds of the event.\n\nBrown, who made his pro debut at La Quinta last year, teed off on 10 and was eight under through his first seven holes thanks to an eagle and six birdies.\n\nAfter a birdie at the second he strung together three more at the fourth, fifth and sixth to reach 12-under for the day.\n\nHe couldn't capitalize on the par-five seventh, settling for a par after his second shot found the rough.\n\nAfter a par at the eighth he had one more chance at the 16th sub-60 round ever on the PGA Tour at the par-four ninth, where a mammoth drive and a crisp wedge left him a birdie look from inside seven feet that he couldn't convert.\n\n\"I saw my spot just a little before the hole,\" he said. \"I got a great read off David Ford. He dripped it in there and it went right dead center. So I was thinking, OK, maybe just a little outside right edge.\n\n\"Unfortunately it didn't go in, but I'm really happy with the outcome I had today.\"\n\nIt was the continuation of a whirlwind week for Brown, who finished tied for 17th in the Korn Ferry developmental tour event in the Bahamas on Wednesday, then, with a sponsor's exemption to play in La Quinta, made his way to California in time to tee it up on Thursday.\n\nHe goes into the weekend tied on 17-under 127 with Scheffler, who had eight birdies in his eight-under 64 on the Nicklaus Tournament course.\n\nScheffler is making his season debut after a 2025 campaign that included two major titles among his six wins.\n\nThrilled to have his name next to Scheffler's atop the leaderboard, Brown wasn't getting ahead of himself.\n\n\"We're halfway there. We've got a lot of golf to go,\" he said, adding that his next order of business would be getting some rest.\n\n\"I'm going to go take a nap,\" Brown said.\n\nThe leading duo were one stroke clear of South Korean Kim Si-Woo, who posted a 65 on the tougher Stadium Course for a 16-under total of 128.\n\nIt was a further stroke back to South Korea's Kim Seong-hyeon and American Matt McCarty.\n\nAmerican Andrew Putnam also flirted with a 59 before settling for a 12-under 60 on the La Quinta course that left him 12-under for the tournament.",

    "description": "“What hormones people have in their bodies play a very small part in what they are able to do athletically,\" the Heated Rivalry star told PRIDE.",
    "fullText": "It turns out trans student athletes aren’t the only ones who are having to contend with politicians keeping them from playing sports, now adult trans hockey players are facing challenges too.\n\nHarrison Browne, who starred in Heated Rivalry and was the first openly transgender pro hockey player, is speaking out against USA Hockey’s new eligibility policy, which doesn’t outright ban trans athletes, but makes it almost impossible for them to compete even in recreational leagues.\n\nBack in November, USA Hockey, the national governing body for hockey, which oversees the U.S. participation in the Olympics, quietly released a new Participant Eligibility Policy, but when Browne found out about it yesterday, he immediately took to Instagram to alert his followers to the updated anti-trans rules.\n\n“USA Hockey is basically telling me I can’t play in a recreational league with friends that I played my entire career with,” Browne told PRIDE. “I just think that’s crazy.\"\n\nThe new policy, which updates what previously was a much more inclusive version from 2019, will put strict rules on who can play in youth, junior, disabled, and adult hockey leagues when it goes into effect on April 1, 2026. According to the updated policy, trans athletes can still play in co-ed leagues, but they are restricted to their sex assigned at birth when it comes to sex-exclusive leagues.\n\n“In all programs where participation is restricted by sex, athletes are only permitted to participate in such programs based on their sex assigned at birth, except that a female (as assigned at birth) may not play in programs restricted to females if they have undergone any male hormone therapy,” the policy reads.\n\nThis means that trans women would be forced to play in men’s leagues, and trans men would have to play in women’s leagues unless they take testosterone, in which case they wouldn’t be allowed in either space.\n\n“The safest spaces I’ve found are queer spaces, are women’s spaces,” Browne said, explaining that forcing trans women to play in men’s leagues wouldn’t be safe because they are still plagued by “homophobia and transphobic language, whether that’s on the ice or behind closed doors in the locker room.”\n\nWhile not an outright ban, this new policy will make it nearly impossible for trans hockey players to play in any league overseen by USA Hockey, which includes less competitive recreational leagues, often called “beer leagues” by players.\n\nWomen’s hockey leagues across the country are having to deal with the new policy, with some taking to social media to assure players that they are looking into what it will mean for them. The Seattle Women’s Hockey Club wrote on Instagram, “To our trans members: it is the board's firm belief that our community is better for having you in it. Hockey belongs to anyone who has ever picked up a stick or cheered on their team, and that includes you, regardless of what USA Hockey says.”\n\nBrowne places the blame for this shift from a fairly inclusive trans participation policy to one that, in practice, will likely keep many trans athletes from playing hockey squarely on President Donald Trump’s shoulders. “We can’t overlook the fact that the [Trump] Administration is putting a lot of pressure on sports organizations to make a stance against trans participation in sports,” he said.\n\nRepublicans frequently claim that their focus on trans women in sports is because they care about fairness, but the argument is specious and ignores the larger issues in the sport, Browne said.\n\n“Transgender women, transgender people are not the issue here,” he said. “It is socioeconomic status, it’s access. If you have access to better coaching, if you have access to better facilities, better equipment, better nutrition, you are automatically going to be a better athlete. What hormones people have in their bodies play a very small part in what they are able to do athletically.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: 'Heated Rivalry's Harrison Browne says new anti-trans hockey policy is 'crazy' and blames Trump\n\nSo you finished 'Heated Rivalry': Here are 2 ways to get into hockey\n\n7 gayest moments from the Professional Women's Hockey League in 2025 (so far)\n\n5 times athletes lived out the plot of 'Heated Rivalry' in real life",

    "fullText": "Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding, an alleged drug kingpin who's been accused of orchestrating multiple murders, was arrested in Mexico and taken to the United States, Justice Department officials announced Friday.\n\nWedding, a 44-year-old Canadian national, was taken into custody in Mexico City on Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel said at a news conference at Southern California's Ontario International Airport east of Los Angeles. During the news conference, Patel gestured to a plane behind him and told reporters Wedding had been taken off the plane.\n\nAn FBI official in Los Angeles told CBS News the U.S. government plane carrying Wedding landed at the airport from Mexico at approximately 8 a.m. local time Friday.\n\nIn a video clip provided by the FBI, a handcuffed Wedding is seen wearing jeans, sneakers, a sweatshirt, a vest and a baseball cap walking down a stairway from the plane flanked by FBI agents. Another clip shows Wedding and authorities walking away from the plane.\n\n\"Just to tell you how bad of a guy Ryan Wedding is, he went from an Olympic snowboarder to the largest narco-trafficker in modern times,\" Patel said. \"He is a modern-day 'El Chapo,' he is a modern-day Pablo Escobar, and he thought he could evade justice.\"\n\n\"El Chapo\" is an alias for Joaquin Guzman, a onetime leader of the notorious Mexican drug ring known as the Sinaloa Cartel who is serving a life sentence in the U.S. According to the FBI, Wedding also used aliases, including \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant\" and \"Public Enemy.\"\n\nPatel also said another fugitive who was arrested in Mexico last week, Alejandro Rosales Castillo, was brought to the U.S. on the same plane as Wedding and would be taken east later Friday. Patel said Castillo's arrest wasn't related to Wedding's apprehension.\n\nPatel told reporters he was in Mexico on a previously planned trip. He said the Mexican government worked with the U.S. to apprehend Wedding.\n\n\"This was a great operation that came together through interagency success,\" Patel said.\n\nPatel said he wouldn't provide additional details about Wedding's arrest \"to safeguard the integrity of the ongoing investigation.\" He declined to comment on the $15 million reward that was being offered by the U.S. for Wedding.\n\nWhen officials increased the reward in November, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi described Wedding's alleged operation as \"one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations in this world.\"\n\nThe Justice Department said it expects Wedding's arraignment to take place on Monday afternoon in Los Angeles.\n\nAkil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said investigators worked for over a year to arrest Wedding. \"Ryan Wedding tormented several people and several families that will never be the same, but today, they get the justice that they sought,\" Davis said.\n\nWedding, who competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, has been accused of running a major drug trafficking network that moved cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the U.S. and Canada. Patel said in a social media post Friday that Wedding was running his alleged operation as a member of the Sinaloa Cartel, and that Wedding was believed to have been hiding out in Mexico for over a decade.\n\nWedding was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list last year.\n\nIn November, Wedding was accused of placing a \"multimillion-dollar bounty\" on a federal witness who was involved in a narcotics case against him.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Wedding and his second-in-command Andrew Clark, 34, allegedly also ordered the killings of two members of a Canadian family in 2023 in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment.\n\nClark was extradited to the U.S. from Mexico last year.\n\nThe pair are also accused of directing the killing of another person in 2024 over a drug debt, according to the FBI.\n\nArkansas mayor on pivoting for ice storm as weather conditions worsen\n\nPennsylvania Gov.

    "fullText": "Aaron Glenn is searching for a new defensive coordinator for his second season with the Jets. Here's the latest on that search...\n\nThe Jets are moving on from a number of coaches, including QB coach Charles London, DL coach Eric Washington, LB coach Aaron Curry and pass game coordinator Scott Turner.\n\nSNY's Connor Hughes said on the latest episode of Jets Final Drive that players had \"a lot\" of issues with Washington and Curry, but Turner being relieved comes as a surprise.\n\nWith the mid-season release of DC Steve Wilks, Jets coach Aaron Glenn has now relieved five coaches of their duties.\n\nThe Jets were busy in the second week of their offseason, completing a first round of interviews for eight candidates for the vacant DC job.\n\nThe team announced that they completed virtual interviews with Wink Martindale, Jim Leonhard, Chris Harris, Jim O'Neil, DeMarcus Covington, Daronte Jones, Mathieu Araujo, and Ephraim Banda.\n\nMartindale is the most senior of the group at 65 years old and has the most experience as a defensive coordinator at the NFL level. Recently, the DC at Michigan, he worked last in the NFL with the Giants, where he had a rocky relationship with then-head coach Brian Daboll. Martindale also held the DC job for four seasons in Baltimore and one in Denver.\n\nLeonhard started 40 games over three seasons as a safety for the Jets. After finishing a 10-year playing career, he entered coaching, spending several years at his alma mater, Wisconsin. He was the DC with the Badgers from 2017-22, finishing as the interim head coach for the last seven games. He made the jump to the NFL in 2024 with another of his former teams, the Broncos, where he's been a defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator for the past two seasons, adding assistant head coach to his title this year.\n\nHarris was hired to Glenn's staff last offseason to be the defensive back coach and passing game coordinator, but finished as interim DC after Steve Wilks' firing. Before coming to New York, the eight-year NFL veteran was Washington's defensive backs coach (2020-22) and Tennessee's DBs coach and passing game coordinator (2023-24).\n\nO'Neil has experience with Glenn in Detroit, where he's worked as a defensive assistant since 2024. He got his first NFL gig with the Jets in 2009 as a defensive quality control coach before serving as assistant DBs coach from 2010-12. He was Cleveland's defensive coordinator for two seasons (2014-15), along with NFL stops in Buffalo (2013), San Francisco (2016), Oakland/Las Vegas (2019-20).\n\nCovington also has experience working as a DC in the NFL, holding that position with New England during the 2024 season. He first joined the Patriots under Bill Belichick, serving as a coaching assistant, outside linebackers coach, and defensive line coach after joining in 2016. He served as defensive line coach/run game coordinator with Green Bay in 2025.\n\nJones was the passing game coordinator and defensive backs coach with the Vikings. He first came to Minnesota in 2020, leaving for one season to be LSU's defensive coordinator in 2021.\n\nAraujo spent the past four seasons, his first in the pro ranks as a coach, with Miami coaching defensive backs.\n\nBanda has been the Browns' safeties coach since 2023 after spending several years coaching in college, including a stint as the DC at Utah State (2021-22).",

    "fullText": "Cristian Chivu experienced a night of mixed emotions at San Siro, but one that ultimately ended in celebration as Inter Milan stormed back to beat Pisa 6-2 and strengthen their grip on top spot.\n\nSpeaking to DAZN after the match, the Inter head coach reflected on a chaotic evening, took responsibility for key moments, and praised the mentality of his squad, particularly young striker Francesco Pio Esposito.\n\nAsked about Federico Dimarco’s introduction and the dramatic shift in momentum, Chivu stressed that belief never dropped.\n\n“I didn’t think anything special,” he explained, with quotes via FCInterNews.\n\n“A match lasts 100 minutes and you can turn it around.

The approach wasn’t bad, then we scored against ourselves, but that’s my fault because I make specific demands of the goalkeeper role that put Yann in difficulty. The goal is my fault, not his.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – DECEMBER 06: Cristian Chivu, Head Coach of FC Internazionale Milano, looks on prior to the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and Como 1907 at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on December 06, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nChivu also addressed Pisa’s second goal, pointing to their physical qualities.\n\n“Then the second goal came. Pisa have players with structure and they delivered the corner well,” he said. “After that, we brought out our pride, pushed the intensity, and turned it around before half-time.”\n\nThe Inter coach then focused on the collective response, especially from players introduced from the bench.\n\n“What matters is attitude and mental preparation,” Chivu said.\n\n“You know you can suffer at times. You have to be responsible for how you behave and how you react. Today we did that well despite the difficulties. We could have suffered mentally, but the team kept doing what it knows how to do.”\n\nHe also highlighted the effort shown across the group.\n\n“Maybe there’s some regret about conceding the 4-2 late on, but hats off to these lads. They give everything they have to make this season competitive and reach our objectives.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 14: Francesco Pio Esposito of FC Internazionale Milano celebrates scoring his team’s first goal with his Head Coach, Cristian Chivu, during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and US Lecce at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 14, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nChivu even found room for humour when asked about his back pain after the decisive fourth goal.\n\n“I filled myself with cortisone,” he joked. “Tomorrow I have to spend the day with my children and my wife. They want me fresh so I can be a good husband and a good father.”\n\nMuch of the post-match focus centred on Pio Esposito, whose performances continue to grow. Chivu made it clear where the credit lies.\n\n“The credit is theirs, in how they work and make themselves available to the group,” he said. “They know that every mistake they make is my fault, while they are the protagonists when things go well because they try to meet my demands.”\n\nHe praised Esposito’s mindset in particular.\n\n“It’s the merit of a boy who wants to prove himself, who wants to put himself on the line and take responsibility like everyone else. If things don’t go well, it’s my fault. But I like that they follow me and want to make this season what we all hope it can be.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 09: Cristian Chivu, Head Coach of Internazionale, looks on prior to the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SS Lazio at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on November 09, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nChivu also brushed aside questions about watching rival fixtures.\n\n“This question again…” he smiled. “I have a passion for football that goes beyond what people think. I watch a lot of matches, but tomorrow the priority is family. Recently I’ve been absent because I think too much about these wonderful lads and forget my duty as a good husband and father. Sometimes you can’t think only about football.”\n\nSpeaking separately to Inter TV, Chivu returned to the themes of maturity and growth.\n\n“We approached the match in the right way, then the opponents came into it and we made some mistakes,” he said, with quotes again courtesy of FCInterNews.\n\n“We did well to stay clear-headed. That comes from confidence. In the second half maybe we could have killed it earlier given the chances we created, but we take the three points.”\n\nHe underlined the significance of the comeback.\n\n“For the first time this season, the team overturned a double deficit. That has to be highlighted. The growth we’ve shown over the last month and a half paid off in the end.”\n\nFinally, Chivu summed up the mentality he sees within his squad. “This is a mature team that knows there are moments you have to overcome,” he concluded.\n\n“You have to act according to the phase of the game. When you take two slaps like that, you don’t know how you’ll react, but this group knows the difficulties. My demands are always very high. You shouldn’t point fingers at individual performances. I am responsible and I put my face to it. The lads work well, and you can see it.”\n\nInter’s six-goal response may have stolen the headlines, but Chivu’s words revealed a deeper satisfaction.\n\nBeyond the scoreline, he saw proof of belief, accountability and a young striker determined to prove himself at the highest level.",

    "description": "According to the rumor, the NFL's 2025 Super Bowl MVP donated $300,000 of his own money as a way of kick-starting the special fund.",
    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund — in honor of the woman fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis in January 2026 —and contributed $300,000.\n\nIn January 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund. Users' posts claimed the NFL's Super Bowl LIX MVP kickstarted the fund himself, contributing $300,000 of his own money.\n\nThe purported scholarship fund referenced Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident shot fatally shot on Jan. 7 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross.\n\nFor example, on Jan. 20, a user managing the NFL Pulse Facebook page posted (archived) an image collage of three pictures allegedly showing Hurts hugging Good's 6-year-old son on a football field, Good holding her son in front of a body of water and Hurts walking inside a football stadium. The post's text claimed Good's killing inspired Hurts to launch the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, including the $300,000 contribution.\n\nIn short, the rumor was false. One or more users fabricated and promoted the claim with the help of images and text generated with artificial-intelligence tools.\n\nSnopes contacted a manager of the NFL Pulse Facebook page to ask about the fictional stories and AI-generated content displayed on the feed, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles to request an official statement, and will update this story if we receive more information.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post (archived) — as well as other Facebook posts sharing the same rumor — featured links leading to advertisement-filled articles hosted on WordPress blogs. The users owning those blogs earned revenue based on the combination of advertising and made-up stories. The NFL Pulse post redirected to an article on on such untrustworthy website.\n\nSearches of Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google found no news media outlets reporting about Hurts establishing a scholarship fund in Good's name. A Yahoo search did, however, mistakenly produce an AI-generated answer wrongly confirming the rumor as true. Outlets would have widely reported on the story involving Hurts and Good, had it truly occurred.\n\nRegarding the fake, AI-generated photo of Hurts holding Good's son, the most evident sign of AI — aside from the misspelling of \"Eagles\" as \"Eaglees\" — was the reality that sports and standard news outlets would have very widely publicized the moment, had the meeting between the quarterback and young boy truly taken place.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post's text, presented in its entirety later in this article, featured over-dramatic wording common with AI tools. For example, one part of the post read, \"This was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\" Additionally, the idea that individuals or teams aiming to rapidly produce inauthentic content for ad revenue would carefully, slowly and manually write text for their articles simply does not square with reality.\n\nThe person or people who authored the story about Hurts and Good fabricated the entire claim as one of hundreds of inspirational tales that depicted celebrities and athletes performing inspiring acts of kindness. Such stories resemble glurge, which Dictionary.com defines as stories \"that are supposed to be true and uplifting, but which are often fabricated and sentimental.\"\n\nFor readers interested in the story told in the NFL Pulse Facebook post, the post presented the made-up tale as follows:\n\nJalen Hurts has officially established The Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, personally committing an initial $300,000 donation to honor the life of Renee Nicole Good — a mother whose story ended in tragedy after she was killed in Minneapolis, a loss that left an entire community grieving.\n\nBut this gesture goes far beyond a financial contribution.\n\nJalen Hurts founded the scholarship fund himself to ensure that Renee's 6-year-old son will receive full educational support from elementary school through college — including tuition, books, tutoring, and opportunities for personal development. Alongside the financial commitment, Jalen also dedicated his voice, his platform, and his heart to a child now facing a world without his mother.\n\nThis was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\n\nAcross the nation, many were moved not by the amount of money pledged, but by the meaning behind Jalen's decision: a promise that Renee Nicole Good's life mattered, and that her son's future will be protected, supported, and filled with hope.\n\nFor further reading, we previously reported about the time tech billionaire Elon Musk deleted a post supporting the Eagles supporting the Eagles after they lost the 2023 Super Bowl LVII.\n\n\"GLURGE Definition & Meaning.\" Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/glurge.\n\nHuberman, Bond, and David Emery. \"Snopestionary: What Does 'Glurge' Mean?\" Snopes, 21 Aug. 2021, https://www.snopes.com//articles/363643/what-does-glurge-mean/.",

    "fullText": "Inter coach Cristian Chivu is impressed by players’ reaction in a 6-2 win over Pisa and defends Yann Sommer after the Swiss keeper gave away the opening goal: ‘It’s my fault.’\n\nInter came back from two goals down in a home game against Pisa on Friday. The Serie A giants completed the comeback even before the half-time break and then scored three \n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 14: Cristian Chivu, Head Coach of FC Internazionale Milano, reacts during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and US Lecce at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 14, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nA turning point in the game came at minute 34 when Chivu replaced Luis Henrique with Federico Dimarco. The Italian was the Man of the Match, scoring one goal and providing one assist.\n\n“A match lasts 100 minutes, and it can be turned around,” Chivu told DAZN via FCInter1908.\n\nPisa striker Stefano Moreo scored the opening goal with a 30-yard lob, but Sommer gave the ball away outside the box, in an attempt to build up from the back.\n\n“That was my fault because I’m the one who makes certain requests to the goalkeeper. Sometimes I put Yann in difficulty,” Chivu said.\n\n“Then they scored from a set piece. After that, we showed pride and kept pushing with quality and intensity, and we turned it around.\n\n“The attitude is what matters; you might suffer at times, but what counts is how you react. I’d say we did very well,” Chivu continued.\n\n“We could have collapsed, but instead, the team kept doing their things. The only regret is that we didn’t make it 4-2 earlier, only at the end. But hats off to the boys, they give everything they have to make this a competitive season and to show that we’re working to reach our objectives.”\n\nInter came back from two goals down in a home Serie A clash against Pisa, completing a comeback with Piotr Zielinski, Lautaro Martinez and Francesco Pio Esposito in the opening Round 22 match.\n\nPio Esposito gave Inter the lead seconds before the break with his third Serie A goal this season.\n\n“He really wants to prove himself and put himself on the line. He takes responsibility, like all 25 of our players,” Chivu said.\n\n“And if things don’t go well, it will always be my fault because sometimes I push too hard. I’m happy they believe in our work.”\n\nChivu arrived late for his post-match interview as he required treatment from the Inter doctors.\n\n“I’ve filled myself with painkillers for my back,” he revealed.\n\n“Tomorrow, my kids want me fresh, and my wife expects it too. I have to be ready to be a good husband and a good father.”\n\nDoes this mean he won’t watch Juventus-Napoli and Roma-Milan on Sunday?\n\n“That question again…I have a passion for football that goes beyond my job. Sometimes I’m tired because I watch so many matches, but I know you have to watch them to learn,” Chivu concluded.\n\n“If I get the chance to watch them, I will, but my family is the priority because I devote too much time to these fantastic boys and often neglect my duty as a husband and father. And since they deserve it, sometimes, you have to switch off and not think too much about football. Family always comes first.”",

    "fullText": "The bad news is piling up in the Ezeiza offices. After the definitive collapse of negotiations for Alexis Cuello, Boca Juniors has received another \"no,\" this time from Brazil. Fluminense officially rejected the $5 million offer presented by the La Ribera club to acquire the services of Kevin Serna.\n\nThe Colombian forward, who is under contract with the \"Flu\" until December 2027, was declared non-transferable by the Carioca management, which considers the offer insufficient and prioritizes maintaining their structure for the 2026 season. With this rejection, Juan Román Riquelme loses his second priority option to strengthen the wing in less than 24 hours.\n\nWith the refusals for Serna and Cuello, Boca's offensive outlook now depends on parallel negotiations that must be accelerated. The only name that seems to be \"close\" is Ángel Romero, who would arrive as a free agent. However, the Football Council — now under the structure of Marcelo Delgado as manager — is already considering other emergency names.\n\nAmong the alternatives gaining momentum are Rodrigo Auzmendi (Banfield) and the return of inquiries for Chimy Ávila. Meanwhile, the pressure is on to secure at least one significant forward before the debut in the Torneo Apertura, considering that Claudio Úbeda's squad is facing significant injuries in the forward line.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "At long last Zuffa Boxing is set to kick off its debut event later TONIGHT (Fri., Jan. 23, 2026) as Zuffa Boxing 1 is set to go down inside Meta’s Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada. Headlining the event — which will streaming live on Paramount+ — will be a Middleweight showdown between Irish sensation, Callum Walsh, taking on Carlos Ocampo.\n\nWalsh was Dana White’s first-ever signing to his upstart boxing promotion, so it makes sense to have him kickoff the debut event. “King” is undefeated (15-0) with 11 knockouts and is coming off a unanimous decision win over Fernando Vargas Jr. on the “Canelo vs. Crawford”-led undercard in Las Vegas, Nevada, back in Sept. 2025 (full results here). As for Ocampo, he is coming in with a record of 38-3 and is currently riding a three-fight win streak into a bout he hopes will give him the spotlight should he pull off the massive upset.\n\nIt’s an important night for White and Co. since the debut fight card to his boxing venture will either silence a lot of doubters (such as this one), or give them more fuel to spit verbal venom at him for trying to change things up to a combat sport that has marched to the beat of the same drum for decades.\n\nWe don’t expect it to be perfect, but all eyes will be on this event.\n\nMany readers check in before, during and after the fights to share their thoughts on all of the action, as the card kicks off at 6 p.m. ET on Paramount+. Feel free to leave a comment (or several) about the bouts and chat with all the other Maniacs during the show — it’s always a lot of fun!\n\n160 lbs: Callum Walsh vs. Carlos Ocampo\n160 lbs: Misael Rodriguez Olivas vs. Austin Deanda\n147 lbs: Julian Rodriguez vs. Cain Sandoval \n126 lbs: Omar Trinidad vs. Max Ornelas \n118 lbs: Floyd Diaz vs. Guillermo Gutierrez \n118lbs: Emiliano Cardenas vs. Marcus Cortez Harris – Cardenas via unanimous decision\n135 lbs: Robert Meriwether III vs. Cesar Correa – Merriwether III via unanimous decision\n135 lbs: Troy Nash vs. Jacob Ramos – Nash via unanimous decision\n\nWe've got some ACTION at #ZuffaBoxing01💥#RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/9K4xHMg5Lc\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026\n\nOPENING UP THE FIRST ZUFFA BOXING CARD EVER‼️\n\n🇺🇸 @RealTroyNash v Jaycob Ramos 🇺🇸\n\nLIVE on @ParamountPlus | #RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/JdiFSpLuoQ\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026\n\nIT'S ALMOST TIME 🥊#ZuffaBoxing01 kicks off at the top of the hour!\n\nWatch here: https://t.co/bgoL7klXvE | #RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/2Sd0KqPKEJ\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026",

    "title": "Five Ways People Are Using Claude Code",
    "description": "Claude Code generates computer code when people type prompts, so those with no coding experience can create their own programs and apps.",
    "fullText": "Claude Code, an artificial intelligence tool that can generate computer code when people type a prompt, is having a viral moment.\n\nThe tool, which the A.I. start-up Anthropic introduced in May, has shown record growth over the past two weeks, the company said, without sharing its data. People had time to experiment with Claude Code over the holidays, Anthropic said, and users realized how capable it was.\n\nClaude Code is one of several A.I. coding tools — which also include Base44 and Cursor — that people with no coding experience are increasingly using to build their own websites, programs and apps, a trend known as “vibecoding.” People pay a subscription fee of $20 to $200 a month to use Claude Code, depending on the features they want.\n\nHere are five ways that people are using Claude Code:\n\nMr. Hindes, an assistant principal at a school for autistic children, has four children under the age of 9 and turned to A.I. to help him organize his family’s laundry.\n\nLast week, he prompted Claude Code to make a program to identify which clothes belonged to each of his three daughters so he could sort clean laundry into piles without their help. He took pictures of their clothes to teach Claude Code which T-shirt belonged to which daughter. Now he simply holds up the clothes to his laptop camera so the program tells him whom it belongs to.\n\n“The whole process was done within an hour, and the girls were really excited,” he said.\n\nMr. Hindes said he was now building a program with Claude Code to help his daughters independently work though the steps of their morning routine, as if playing a game.\n\n“I’ve tried to teach myself coding at various points but never stuck with it,” he said.\n\nMr. Stephenson, an art and architecture photographer, started using Claude Code in November to build a website about a documentary feature.\n\nThe website was created in about a day, he said, with an interactive map of New York City that captured his photos and audio recordings to document life in each borough.\n\n“Once the basic site was done, emboldened by my new capabilities, I started adding features I hadn’t even considered,” said Mr. Stephenson, who pays $20 a month for Claude Code. “Light/dark mode? Easy. Shuffle button? Done.”\n\nIf Claude Code could not solve a particular problem, he turned to Google’s A.I. chatbot, Gemini, to ask how it would approach the issue.\n\n“I’d envisioned something like this when I started a couple of years ago, but assumed it would cost thousands of dollars to build,” he said.\n\nMr. Roberts, an assistant prosecuting attorney, used Claude Code and Cursor in August to create a mobile app called AlertAssist, which lets users send a mass text to contacts in an emergency. Working in law enforcement got Mr. Roberts interested in trying to help people act quickly and safely in an emergency.\n\nThe design and user interface of the app are “very basic, but it works,” he said.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Haubo Dyhrberg, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Delaware, had an idea to make a stock trading simulator for her class. She consulted her husband, a software engineer, but “the task seemed too daunting.”\n\nOn Monday, she downloaded Claude Code and within two hours had a working demo of a trading simulator that her students could use to trade securities in a mock market. She has built five different trading scenarios for students to explore various challenges in financial markets.\n\n“I never thought it would be this easy,” she said. “I can’t wait to test it out when the semester starts in two weeks.”\n\nMr. Bacus, who owns a welding and metal fabrication business, tapped Claude Code last month to create an A.I. assistant to manage his calendar and find him new business opportunities. The business is just him and three others, so “we’re not in the place right now to afford an office team,” Mr. Bacus said. “It’s all on me.”\n\nWith Claude Code, he built a personal A.I. assistant that connects to his calendar, Google Sheets and Gmail account so he can easily create estimates, track the progress of jobs and organize contracts.\n\n“I’m a skilled laborer who barely passed high school in the early 2000s,” Mr. Bacus said, adding: “But over the past few months, I’ve taught myself to build actual tools for my business.”",

    "description": "A new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track space junk by tuning into their sonic booms.",
    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.\n\nScientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object’s path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.\n\nUsing this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly — crucial if the debris is dangerous.\n\n“The problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,” said Johns Hopkins University’s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. “But once it gets to the point that it’s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.”\n\nHis team’s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.\n\nA growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.\n\n“There are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,” including SpaceX’s Starlinks and other companies’ internet satellites, said Fernando. “Unfortunately, we don’t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.”\n\nFernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London’s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object’s suspected path.\n\nChina’s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country’s space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module — more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size — broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object’s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.\n\nFernando acknowledged it’s impossible to know how close his team’s predictions are to the actual path since no debris was reported on the ground.\n\nThe goal is to ascertain, within minutes or even seconds, the speed and direction of the incoming space junk as well as its fragmentation. In remote areas like the South Pacific, nuclear blast monitoring stations could potentially track the sonic booms to fine-tune the paths of descent. That’s where NASA plans to ditch the International Space Station in five years. SpaceX is working on the deorbiting vehicle to ensure a controlled entry.\n\nFernando is looking to eventually publish a catalog of seismically tracked, entering space objects, while improving future calculations by factoring in the wind’s effect on falling debris.\n\nIn a companion article in Science, Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Chris Carr, who was not involved in the study, said further research is needed to reduce the time between an object’s final plunge and the determination of its course.\n\nFor now, Carr said this new method “unlocks the rapid identification of debris fall-out zones, which is key information as Earth’s orbit is anticipated to become increasingly crowded with satellites, leading to a greater influx of space debris.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "title": "Hollywood Try to Take Pirate Sites Down Globally Through Indian Court",
    "description": "The High Court in New Delhi, India, has granted another pirate site blocking order in favor of American movie industry giants.",
    "fullText": "Pirate sites and services can be a real challenge for rightsholders to deal with. In India, however, recent court orders have proven to be quite effective.\n\nIndian courts have issued pirate site blocking orders for over a decade. Initially, these orders were relatively basic, requiring local Internet providers to block specific domain names.\n\nThese regular injunctions were only partially effective. After the High Court granted a blocking injunction, pirate sites would often switch to new domains, requiring rightsholders to return to court to get these blocked as well.\n\nTo deal with this problem, the dynamic injunction was invented. These orders were issued to more effectively deny access to content made available on pirate sites. ISPs were not only required to block original domains but also any clones and mirror sites that surfaced after the order was signed.\n\nWhen dynamic injunctions were no longer sufficient to slay the piracy hydra, rightsholders suggested upgrading the Indian blocking regime with Dynamic ++ injunctions. These orders also protect copyrighted content that has yet to be registered.\n\nIn addition, Dynamic++ orders and their ‘superlative‘ variant also include domain name registrars as defendants. This includes blocking orders targeted at U.S. domain registrars.\n\nThe ability to target domain name registrants proved to be a game changer. Over the past two years, it allowed rightsholders to disable domains of various prominent pirate sites, some with dozens of millions of visitors. While these sites could simply register new domains, the legal efforts certainly affected their operation.\n\nFor this reason, it is no surprise to see that several American movie industry players have ramped up their enforcement actions in India, targeting hundreds of domains at a time. And since these orders effectively suspend domains at various domain name registrars, new requests keep coming in.\n\nAs reported by Verdictum a few days ago, the High Court in New Delhi issued a new blocking injunction on December 18, targeting more than 150 pirate site domains, including yflix.to, animesuge.bz, bs.to, and many others.\n\nThe complaint is filed by Warner Bros., Apple, Crunchyroll, Disney, and Netflix, which are all connected to the MPA’s anti-piracy arm, ACE. The referenced works include some of the most pirated titles, such as Stranger Things, Squid Game, and Silo.\n\nIn addition to targeting Indian ISPs, the order also lists various domain name registries and related organizations as defendants. This includes American registrars such as Namecheap and GoDaddy, but also the government of the Kingdom of Tonga, which is linked to .to domains.\n\nIn addition to suspending the domain names within three days days, the domain name registrars are given four weeks to disclose the relevant subscriber information connected to these domains.\n\n“[The registrars] shall lock and suspend Defendant Nos. 1 to 47 websites within 72 hours of being communicated with a copy of this Order and shall file all the Basic Subscriber Information, including the name, address, contact information, email addresses, bank details, IP logs, and any other relevant information […] within four weeks of being communicated with a copy of this Order,” the High Court wrote.\n\nWhile the “Dynamic+” injunction is designed to be a global kill switch, its effectiveness depends entirely on the cooperation of the domain name registrars. Since most of these are based outside of India, their compliance is not guaranteed.\n\nAccording to our analysis, it appears that most domain names have not been suspended. These pirate sites domains continue to be accessible today. Some continue running from their original domains, while others redirect to new ones, suggesting that they remain controlling their original owners.\n\nThis includes domains that are linked to Namecheap, Tucows, GoDaddy, NameSilo, Dynadot, OVH and others. The government of the Kingdom of Tonga did not comply with the Indian court order either.\n\nAs far as we can see, domains linked to the American registrar Porkbun, the UK-based WHG Hosting services, and the Lithuanian registrar Hostinger were fully suspended. Registrar.eu also put some domains on clientHold, and the one that remains accessible (animesuge.bz) is linked to Namecheap now.\n\nIt’s not unprecedented for foreign companies, including American ones, not to comply with Indian court orders. However, in this case, it is worth noting that Namecheap previously appeared to comply with similar orders from the Delhi High Court.\n\nThe non-compliance must come as a disappointment to Netflix, Warner Bros. and the others. However, they will likely be back in court for more blocking and suspension orders soon enough.\n\nAll in all, it is clear that India’s High Court has a streamlined process in place that effectively orders local ISPs to block pirate sites. However, the intended global reach seems to be restricted to a few registrars, for now.\n\nA copy of the High Court order, issued on December 18, 2025, by Justice Tejas Karia, is available here (pdf). The court order includes 163 unique domain names, some of which are not linked to a registrar. An overview of the 125 domains that are linked to targeted registrars and related entities is provided below. .",

    "fullText": "The story’s main image: an 18th-century self-portrait showing a painter seated in an upholstered wooden chair in front of a light gray wall. He’s looking straight ahead, directly at the viewer, with his body turned to the left of the picture. He has brown hair, which hangs down just past his ears, and dark eyes. His mouth is closed, and he has a scar on his cheek. He is wearing a dark gray coat with pinkish-burgundy trim over a white shirt, and he has a white bow tied around his neck. He holds a single paintbrush in one hand and more brushes and a palette in the other. There are smears of red, white, pink, and gray paint on the palette, and there are some marks on the wall behind him.\n\nA painting of Socrates, about to drink the hemlock that will kill him. He sits on what appears to be a bed, near the center of the picture, surrounded by people draped in colorful cloth. Some look at him, while others look away or hold their heads in their hands. He wears a white cloth that bares his chest and stomach. With his left hand, he points toward the ceiling; with his right hand, he reaches for a cup, which is held by a person in a red cloth whose head is turned, and whose eyes are hidden. In the background, on the left, an archway opens onto a stairwell, where a few more people are standing.\n\nA photograph of a museumgoer wearing a quilted blue jacket and facing a very large painting. The painting depicts the coronation of Napoleon, in Notre-Dame Cathedral, with a richly dressed crowd in attendance. The museumgoer stands off to the right.\n\nBack to the story’s main image.\n\nA photograph of a large-scale painting — a Roman scene — in a museum gallery room.\n\nA closer view of the painting: In the center stands a bearded man draped in gray and red cloth. He’s holding three swords with their blades facing down, and he’s facing three helmeted men who reach out their arms to him from the left side of the picture. On the right sit several women and children — leaning on one another, apparently in consolation.\n\nA detailed sketch of a large, boisterous crowd gathered on an indoor tennis court — a big room with a high ceiling. In the center, a man stands on a table. He faces forward, raising his right hand and holding a piece of paper in his left hand. Along the left and right sides of the room, up near the ceiling, there are rows of open windows, where more people look in and curtains billow.\n\nA scrolling display of historical images — mostly black-and-white prints on yellowed pages — showing scenes from the French revolution: fighting in the streets, a trial, guillotines. There are also, amid these, a portrait of Jacques-Louis David and a sketch of Marie Antoinette.\n\nA photograph of a painting in a darkened room in a museum.\n\nA closer view of the painting: A dead or dying man sits in a bath, slumped over to his right side. His head is wrapped in a white cloth, his eyes are closed and he has a gash in his chest. The bath water is bloody, and the tub itself is draped in green and white cloth. The man holds a blood-stained piece of paper in his left hand and a quill in his right. There is a bloody knife with a white handle on the ground beside him. Next to the bath is a wooden box, with another quill, an inkpot and some papers on top of it. There is some writing on the side of the box, including the words “À Marat” and “David.”\n\nBack to the story’s main image.\n\nA detailed sketch of a Roman scene: A bearded man sits in shadow in the foreground, holding a piece of paper in his left hand and raising his right hand to his head. Behind him, other men carry out bodies covered by sheets. Off to his side, a woman raises her arms and moves toward the bodies and the men carrying them. She appears to be in distress, as do several others who are clustered around her.\n\nA finished version of the sketch seen above: The composition and the figures in it are much the same, but here they are rendered in colorful paint.\n\nA sketch of a woman on a yellowed, widely gridded sheet of paper. She is draped in a white cloth and stretching her arms out to her sides. Her head is turned to her left. Beneath her, in small letters, is some writing in script.\n\nClose-up of a painting showing the same woman, now surrounded by other figures: women and children, and men holding shields and swords.\n\nA slightly wider view, showing women holding children up high above their heads, and men holding spears.\n\nThe full painting: women and their children; men — many of them nude save for helmets and neck shawls — wielding their weapons; horses; and a large building in the background.\n\nA photograph of a painting in a museum.\n\nA closer view of the painting, which shows Napoleon astride a rearing white horse. He wears military dress, including a bicorne hat, and he’s wrapped in an orange cape. His left hand is gloved and holds the horse’s reins; his right hand is bare and points ahead. Behind him, soldiers push a cannon and a French flag waves. Mountains rise in the background.\n\nA different version of the story’s main image: It’s the same picture, but the colors are warmer and there appears to be less texture.\n\nA photograph of the story’s main image, framed and hanging in a darkened room in a museum.\n\nBack to the story’s main image.",

    "description": "As the Trump administration erodes U.S. | As the Trump administration erodes U.S. infrastructure supporting infectious disease vaccines, mRNA heavyweight Moderna plans to pull away from late-stage clinical trial investments in the area.",
    "fullText": "As the Trump administration erodes U.S. infrastructure supporting infectious disease vaccines, mRNA heavyweight Moderna plans to pull away from late-stage clinical trial investments in the area.\n\n“We do not foresee investing in new phase 3 studies in a foreseeable futures [sic] in vaccines,” Moderna’s CEO Stéphane Bancel told Bloomberg TV, placing emphasis on the word “new.”\n\nWhen asked if the anti-vaccine climate is going to affect Moderna’s business and ability to develop more vaccines, Bancel said, “100%.”\n\nYou cannot make a return on investment if you don't have access to the U.S. market, or because of delays—regulatory-wise—or because your market is much smaller, because you don't have a recommendation by the government,” Bancel said yesterday on the ‍sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nCurrently, the company touts 12 viral or bacterial vaccine programs in phase 2 development or earlier, according to its online pipeline.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Moderna spokesperson pointed to the company’s priorities set out in its Nov. 20 earnings release. At the time, the mRNA specialist announced the discontinuation of four clinical mRNA programs and outlined a three-year business strategy with the goal of boosting revenue by 10% in 2026.\n\n“Over the next three years, we expect to build a large seasonal vaccine franchise for at-risk populations and invest the cash generated into oncology and rare disease therapeutics,” Bancel said at the time.\n\nThe November release also outlines Europe as “a significant market for respiratory virus vaccines.”\n\nThe Moderna spokesperson declined to comment on future plans for its current phase 2 infectious disease programs.\n\nBancel’s comments come days after Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Ph.D., rebuked Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., describing the lawyer’s stance on vaccines as “anti-science.”\n\nJust a few years ago, Moderna and Pfizer raced to develop and deliver COVID-19 vaccines—Spikevax and Comirnaty, respectively—to abate the worldwide pandemic. Their efforts and success prompted major revenue and investment not only into their companies but into the biopharma industry itself.\n\nBut over the last year, U.S. mistrust in vaccines has continued to accelerate, as long-time vaccine conspiracist RFK. Jr. divests and dismantles federal infrastructure for the science. Just this month, the CDC overhauled the longstanding U.S. childhood vaccine schedule, removing broad vaccination recommendations for COVID, flu, rotavirus, meningitis, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n\nFor Bancel, the falling-out means Moderna is turning its focus toward cancer. Earlier this week, the company shared five-year data for its Merck & Co.-partnered cancer vaccine, which, when combined with Keytruda, cut the risk of cancer recurrence or death by 49% in comparison to Keytruda alone.\n\nThe move isn’t shocking, as Moderna’s Kyle Holen, M.D., head of development, therapeutics and oncology, told Fierce in October that most of the company's upcoming investigational new drug applications will be in the oncology space. Holen cited the political climate for developing infectious disease vaccines and “a huge unmet need in cancer” as reasons behind the decision.\n\nThough Moderna is moving away from vaccines for infectious diseases, Bancel has expressed disappointment about the action.\n\n“It is sad for us to see that. Vaccines that have been proven for decades helping people around the world are not recommended anymore,” he told Bloomberg TV.\n\n“If you look at all healthcare interventions, getting a vaccine is one of the highest return investments in the same year—not 10 or 20 years out—to prevent cardiac attack,” the leader said about COVID-19 and flu vaccines, noting that the inoculations also prevent hospitalizations related to severe illness.\n\n“We tend to forget that hospitalization is a big deal,” Bancel continued. “If you are 67 years old, you get hospitalized—in a week, you can lose 10% of your muscle mass. Ten percent muscle mass doesn't seem a lot like this, but it might mean the difference between you being able to live a high-quality life and your life becoming living from your bed to your sofa. So that’s the message about vaccines.”",

    "title": "'High School Musical' at 20: How Kenny Ortega made a musical on a shoestring budget — and turned it into a multibillion-dollar franchise",
    "description": "For the 20th anniversary of \"High School Musical,\" director-choreographer Kenny Ortega opened up about pitching, casting, and filming the franchise.",
    "fullText": "Do you remember what you were doing on this day 20 years ago? If you were an avid Disney Channel viewer, chances are, the answer is living and breathing \"High School Musical.\"\n\nIn January 2006, a direct-to-TV movie musical starring a cast of largely unknown teenagers set a single-night audience record on the Disney Channel. It was such a hit that the house of mouse promptly doubled down with repeat screenings, sing-along versions, piles of merchandise, and a live concert tour that packed arenas across the country. By the time the year was out, the soundtrack had become the top-selling album of 2006.\n\nNo one could have known that a Disney Channel Original Movie would eventually become a hit trilogy and multibillion-dollar franchise, but director Kenny Ortega was never in the business of half-heartedness. He'd already made a name for himself as a choreographer (\"Dirty Dancing,\" \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" Madonna's \"Material Girl\") and a director (\"Newsies,\" \"Hocus Pocus\"). He'd signed on to choreograph and direct \"High School Musical\" because he recognized his younger self in the story — but also because he saw potential for an ambitious production, complete with original songs and colorful dance sequences.\n\nOrtega successfully won support from Disney Channel executives to turn the original script into a \"full-on musical,\" which, at the time, was not a popular format for the network.\n\n\"The musical was dead, according to the industry,\" Ortega told Business Insider. \"The budget came in, and I was like, how the heck am I going to be able to do this?\"\n\nWith only about a month to shoot and a few million dollars to spend, it was crucial to ensure that each piece to the puzzle fit perfectly.\n\n\"We made every dollar stretch and every minute mean something,\" Ortega said. \"We didn't waste any time. Nothing ended up on the cutting room floor.\"\n\nOrtega and his team eventually landed on Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens to play Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez, a basketball star and a whiz kid who discover an unlikely love for theater. The high schoolers resolve to follow their dreams and, of course, fall in love in the process. Offscreen, Efron and Hudgens followed suit, dating for several years.\n\nAs \"High School Musical\" celebrates its 20th anniversary this week, Business Insider spoke with Ortega about the movie's key casting decisions, the actors' real-life relationships, and the potential for another sequel.\n\nIs it true that you wanted to run the auditions for \"High School Musical\" like Broadway auditions?\n\nI did. And I got in a little trouble for that in the beginning.\n\nI remember Judy Taylor, who I adore, who was head of casting at Disney Channel for many, many years, came to me during our big final testing. We had about 25 and 30 kids for the finals. And then we narrowed it down to about 18. And I had them in the room for about six hours — they were playing basketball, they were dancing, they were singing, they were improvising. I was flipping them around and switching them around and looking at the chemistry that was in the room and looking at the promise that was in front of me.\n\nThe next day, Judy came back and said, \"The agents are flipping out. They want to know what the heck's going on over here. These kids have other auditions, other people to meet, and you're holding them ransom.\"\n\nBut then the next day, Judy came back to me and said that Zac Efron's agent called her and said, \"Zac said it's the best audition he's ever been to.\" And that even if he didn't get the part, it was worth being a part of the auditioning.\n\nIt was such fun. The kids in that room with me were having an absolute ball. I don't think they'd ever been put through any kind of an audition like that, being West Coast actors and not East Coast theater actors. I put them through the mill.\n\nWere any of the main cast members almost passed over because there were concerns about their stamina, or their singing and dancing abilities?\n\nThere were questions. I mean, I think everybody saw the chemistry between Zac and Vanessa from the very, very beginning and knew that it was palpable and that that was going to be hard to top, but there were also concerns about whether they could handle the responsibility. They were young. Vanessa was 15, Zac was 16, and we were putting them in a full-on musical that they had to carry.\n\nFortunately, we also had the support of Ashley Tisdale and all the other brilliant [actors], Corbin Bleu and Lucas Grabeel and Monique Coleman. And beyond that, with people like Alyson Reed and Bart Johnson. And so we had them surrounded with a lot of great energy and intelligence, and we did it.\n\nBut no, I don't think anyone really was averse to any of the choices that we made. It was hard for me to get Ashley because she was already a big star for Disney Channel, and I think they were priming her for her own movie. And I was like, \"Please!\" I was crazy in love with what I knew she could do with this role, and she was delicious to work with.\n\nI can't imagine anyone else playing Sharpay.\n\nHonestly, every day she brought something to the party, to the game. There were days where she would come in and she would say to me, \"Don't say anything! Don't say anything! Can I show you something?\" She was just really an improvisational genius, and she really had her arms wrapped around Sharpay, and we had the most fun developing that role together and working with [screenwriter] Peter Barsocchini, of course.\n\nYou know, in the beginning, Ryan and Sharpay weren't brother and sister. They weren't twins. They were just two characters in the high school that were both in the theater department. But the chemistry that they had together in the auditions, I said, \"I think we should make them twins.\" I said, \"They've got something here that I think we could have a heck of a lot of fun with.\" And everybody agreed, and we moved forward with that idea.\n\nThis is an interesting point, because Ryan and Sharpay are auditioning to play a couple in the musical, are they not?\n\nYes. [Laughs.] We didn't change that. I don't think we thought it through. I think we were a little busy.\n\nDid any of the actors butt heads behind the scenes?\n\nNo. I mean, there was some really fun rapport between Lucas and Ashley that they incorporated into their work.\n\nThere was this wonderful kind of tug of war between the two of them. And then when the lights came on, and the cameras were rolling, it was just like they were onstage. They put it on.\n\nWe felt that. We saw that. We saw them bickering or challenging one another, and we just found it to be really great. And I didn't have to ask them to be anything. All I had to do was just turn on the camera and get out of the way.\n\nI was there to guide and direct and suggest and mold, but these kids brought a lot. They really did that. They studied, they cared. Day one, Zac said, \"Don't worry about time. Don't worry about working us, Kenny. We all committed to do this. Let's make it worth something. Let's make this worth us all being here.\"\n\nZac was initially really helpful in me sort of raising the bar on what I could expect from these young people. Because before that, other than \"Newsies,\" I hadn't been really experienced in working with kids that young.\n\nWas there any concern about Zac and Vanessa potentially breaking up during the trilogy?\n\nWell, I think you quietly have concern because you know that that could impact a kind of energy and comfort. And especially with younger kids, you want to make sure that it doesn't change the sort of climate and ease that we walk into every day. But it didn't weigh heavily on me. They were all friendly. They all got along. They all enjoyed each other's company. There was no one that was over here and everybody over here. They really all enjoyed each other's company. They were a tight-knit group of kids all through it. They were serving of one another, helpful to one another. And I don't remember that weighing on me.\n\nCertainly, no one said, \"Hey, be careful.\" No one really brought it up. And I wasn't aware that they even had a kind of romance, a kind of care for one another in that capacity, until almost the end of the first movie. And I thought it was so silly that I didn't pick up on it, but I was a little busy.\n\nWas there a version of the movie in which Troy and Gabriella do kiss at the end?\n\nI don't think at the end of one, no. I don't think we wanted that. And not because we knew that there would be a two. I just think that we felt that that was something that we could all hope and wish for, but that it wasn't time for it.\n\nI think Zac and Vanessa wanted it, if I'm not mistaken. I think both of them were like, \"We could do a little kiss. I think that it would end the movie in a really lovely place.\" And we said, \"You already have. You've already ended the movie in a really, really lovely place. There's all kinds of promise about where these two kids are going.\"\n\nZac has gone on to do other musicals like \"Hairspray\" and \"The Greatest Showman,\" which is maybe a surprise, given that he didn't do all his vocals in the first movie.\n\nHe did part of it. A lot of people don't know that. A lot of people think that he was lip-syncing the whole movie. He wasn't.\n\nDrew [Seeley] did an incredible job. Drew's an amazing composer and lyricist and performer and actor and singer, and he helped us. But because the music for one was written before we had Zac, the music wasn't written for Zac. And so there was some of the music there that was just out of his range. But he did a lot of it. And then Drew filled in some of the higher-register parts. But \"High School Musical 2\" and three is all Zac.\n\nWhose decision was that? Was it Zac coming to you, saying, \"I want to do the singing now,\" or was it your call?\n\nWe all wanted him to do it because we all wanted everybody to be doing their own work. And it was hard for him. It was a challenge, but God bless him, he accepted the role, and he went along with us, and he sang all through all those scenes where you see him, he's singing along with the track.\n\nWhen we knew that we were going to make a second, it was on everybody's plate. We're going to write the songs now, knowing Zac's voice, knowing Zac's range and register, so he can deliver all the music for the next movie.\n\nIn your mind, would Troy and Gabriella have made it as a couple? Twenty years later, are they still together?\n\nWell, that would be unfair of me. I wouldn't want to get in the way of Peter Barsocchini being able to write a fourth movie, if that's the plan. So I wouldn't want to throw anything out there, because as a director, I would want to be open to either way, whether they stayed together or whether they didn't stay together, that if I was fortunate enough to be invited to come back and do it again and everyone wanted to, that I would be open to looking at whatever Peter wanted to put in front of us as what he would think the future brought for those characters.\n\nI think all of us hope that they would be together, but maybe not necessarily as a couple, maybe just connected in some kind of wonderful, soulful, spiritual way. Friends, even. Who knows? We'll see. I don't know if it's going to happen, but it's been talked about.\n\nSo you're not connected to a fourth movie right now?\n\nNo, no, I'm not. No one has reached out to me and said, \"We're doing it.\" But I know that the fans have been asking, could we do some kind of coming back together, some kind of a reunion show? And hey, I'd just be happy with a nice dinner with everybody present and with no rush to get out after dessert.\n\nBut for the fans, I hope we could do something. I think that would be lovely. They're deserving. They've been amazing. They've changed all of our lives.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.",

    "fullText": "2026 has so far resembled the worst parts of 2025 at many quant hedge fund managers.\n\nThe beginning of the year had the worst stretch of losses since early October, according to a Goldman Sachs report, and several big-name managers did not avoid the pain.\n\nHSBC's Hedge Weekly report states that Renaissance Technologies' two largest funds lost roughly 4% each through January 9. A person familiar with Schonfeld said the manager's quant-only strategy was down 3.9% through January 16.\n\nEngineers Gate was down around 6% midway through the month, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nRenaissance, Schonfeld, and Engineers Gate declined to comment.\n\nThe average computer-run equity fund was down 1% through January 15, according to Goldman's note. The losses were mainly driven by US stocks, which have been choppy to start the year thanks to trade proposals floated by President Donald Trump's administration. Funds crowding into similar trades have also hurt returns, Goldman notes.\n\nPerformance on January 16 — not captured in the Goldman note — was especially bad for many quant funds, industry insiders said.\n\nLast year, systematic funds had several extended periods of losses, including a stint in June and July that one consultant described to Business Insider as \"a long, slow bleed.\" Funds gradually recouped summer losses, but ran into trouble again in early October when crowded trades, a momentum sell-off, and inflated junk stocks led to drawdowns.\n\nWhile funds again rebounded from those losses, the average quant returned 7.7% last year, according to hedge fund research firm PivotalPath, less than the average fund and the S&P 500's 2025 gain.\n\nPivotalPath flagged equity quant crowding as an investor concern in a January report, noting that spikes in crowding measures have preceded previous drawdowns in systematic trading strategies.",

The National Weather Service is warning that more than 230 million Americans will be affected, from the Southwest to New England.\n\nEven if you won't change your plans, your flight may still get canceled. Delta Air Lines said Thursday it is canceling flights at airports in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee, citing safety concerns caused by heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain. The airline will also be bringing in cold-weather specialists.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, based on the Misery Map, which tracks real-time flight disruptions, there hasn't been a spike in delays or cancellations.\n\nBased on recent storms, such as the one that hit over Thanksgiving and coincided with the end of the government shutdown, mass cancellations may be inevitable. So it's good to know your passenger rights and your options when things don't go according to plan.\n\nIf your flight is canceled and you choose not to rebook, the airline is legally required to provide you with a cash refund — not a voucher or credit.\n\nHowever, things are different for delays. The Trump Administration recently killed a proposal that would have required airlines to compensate passengers for long delays, so flyers largely have to rely on airline goodwill or their credit cards to get anything for the inconvenience.\n\nSome airlines have committed to providing accommodations, transportation, and food during a controllable overnight delay or cancellation, as outlined in the Airline Customer Service Dashboard.\n\nControllable disruptions include issues such as maintenance or crew staffing. Frontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of a controllable overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nIt still doesn't hurt to ask for a meal or hotel voucher when a non-controllable issue arises, such as the weather. The worst they can say is no.\n\nDuring disruptions, airlines often allow you to make changes via their mobile app or website, rather than waiting on clogged phone lines or in long customer service lines.\n\nIf this isn't an option, try an online chat. Carriers like Delta Air Lines allow you to text a representative for help.\n\nYou can put yourself in the virtual queue and wait in line at the airport, potentially upping your chances of speaking with an agent sooner.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nTravel credit cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the American Express Platinum, offer built-in insurance that reimburses travelers for hotel, meal, and transportation expenses incurred due to certain flight disruptions.\n\nThe weather is typically covered. For this to work, the traveler would have needed to book their flight with that travel card.\n\nIf your credit card doesn't offer travel insurance, it may be worthwhile to purchase a separate trip insurance policy before traveling. This type of insurance can help reimburse costs you might lose due to flight problems, such as prepaid hotel stays or cruise bookings.\n\nHowever, you must purchase this insurance before any travel disruptions occur — once you know a flight might be affected, it's likely too late.",

    "description": "Online insurance firm Lemonade said it would offer a policy designed specifically for self-driving cars, starting with Tesla.",
    "fullText": "Tesla's car sales may have struggled recently, but Morgan Stanley says a recent update in the insurance space is a positive signal for the real bull case for Tesla stock: autonomous driving.\n\nOnline insurance provider Lemonade announced the launch of a new product for self-driving cars this week. The Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance will begin with a 50% rate cut for Tesla drivers when their vehicle's autonomous driving software is in control.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts say this is a \"critical unlock\" for Tesla and the broader self-driving car market. It indicates that insurance providers may finally be gaining confidence in autonomous technology.\n\nOne of the largest hurdles to autonomous driving has been insurance providers' reluctance. High uncertainty regarding liability and risk has prompted many companies to avoid insuring vehicles with autonomous capabilities.\n\nLemonade's decision to start ensuring Tesla vehicles equipped with the tech might mark a breakthrough, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n\"This is an important shift in how insurers treat advanced driver-assistance and autonomy features,\" he said. \"Lemonade's approach suggests growing confidence in the data coming from Tesla's fleet, using real-world driving outcomes to assess safety performance rather than relying solely on theoretical or regulatory classifications.\"\n\nWhile Lemonade's announcement is specific to Tesla cars for now, the EV leader is seen as a bellwether for the autonomous driving industry. Percoco added that he expects more companies to follow Lemonade and start insuring self-driving cars.\n\n\"Lemonade's announcement points toward a future in which insurance becomes one of the clearest market-based validators of autonomous driving progress,\" he wrote.\n\nWith Tesla's electric vehicle sales down for two consecutive years, Elon Musk is betting big on autonomous driving, and investors see the technology as the primary justification for the stock's premium valuation. More accessible insurance could hasten the adoption of autonomous driving tech.\n\n\"As insurers incorporate increasingly granular driving data into pricing, technologies that demonstrably reduce risk should be rewarded faster and more transparently,\" he noted. \"For Tesla, this marks another step toward external recognition that FSD is moving from an experimental feature to an economically relevant safety system.\"",

    "description": "Goldman just completed its second-best year on record by revenue, and its stock has been surging, which has contributed to David Solomon's rising pay.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs' David Solomon has restored the bank's swagger — and it just rewarded him with a $47 million pay package for 2025.\n\nIt's his highest annual pay yet, and it puts him ahead of his top competitor on Wall Street, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, whose firm announced this week it would pay him $43 million for last year's performance.\n\nSolomon's prior-year compensation was $39 million for 2024, meaning this year's pay is up 21%.\n\nGoldman announced his compensation in a regulatory filing on Friday, citing \"continued and significant shareholder value creation during 2025, including a total shareholder return of 57%,\" under Solomon's leadership. It touted \"strong firmwide financial performance\" and \"continued advancement of our people strategy\" amid heightened competition for talent.\n\nSolomon won't take home all $47 million in cash — his base salary is $2 million, a cash component makes up $10 million, and the rest will be distributed across stock units and carried interest, the bank said. The performance stock units that Goldman awarded Solomon make up the lion's share of the pay package: $31.5 million.\n\nNext month, it's expected that other banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup will announce their chief execution compensation as well.\n\nSolomon's pay is a bellwether for how the board thinks the firm is doing, and has been directly linked to performance. At the moment, shareholders seem pleased with Solomon's approach to management, with its stock up more than 43% in the past year.\n\nThe firm just wrapped its second-best year overall, reporting net revenues of more than $58 billion in its most recent earnings disclosure last week.\n\nAnd its investment bank, which handles high-profile corporate mergers and capital-raising events, also had its best year ever by revenue. Goldman said its 2025 banking and markets revenues were more than $41 billion, up 18% over the year prior; and investment banking fees were up 21%.\n\nWhen he spoke to shareholders and analysts this earnings season, Solomon doubled down on his commitment to steer the firm through the AI revolution, and said 2026 M&A levels could rise to or surpass the records observed in 2021.\n\nThough he had a rough few years, punctuated by stinging headlines and internal ups-and-downs — including rifts over a misfired consumer banking strategy and his stint as a DJ — Solomon has largely put the public criticism to bed and aligned its ranks behind a vision he first outlined at an Investor Day about six years ago.\n\nRoughly a year ago, the bank awarded Solomon and his deputy, President and COO John Waldron, $80 million each in restricted stock units set to vest over a five-year period.\n\nBut when his reputation has taken a bruising, so has his paycheck. In 2022, Solomon took a 30% pay cut during a difficult year for Goldman, including when his consumer banking ambitions tanked.",

    "fullText": "As a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels, I've explored Europe extensively to find the best recommendations for my clients.\n\nThough popular cities such as Paris, London, Rome, and Amsterdam have massive appeal, the continent's vast landscape offers gems around every corner.\n\nHere are five European destinations I think everyone should visit at least once.\n\nSalzburg is a stunning destination — especially if you're a \"Sound of Music\" fan.\n\nThere are plenty of prearranged tours to iconic filming locations where you can dance around the Pegasus fountain like Maria and the children, visit the \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" gazebo, and tour the stunning Basilika St. Michael, where Maria was married to Captain Von Trapp.\n\nIn the summer and fall, there are even \"Sound of Music\" bike tours available.\n\nAnd yes, there are plenty of other activities in the city, even if you're not into musicals. Young children may like the Salzburg Zoo, and music lovers can explore Mozart's birthplace and residence.\n\nSitting atop a hill, Hohensalzburg Fortress is one of the largest castles in the area and boasts great views of the city. To get another stunning view, take the Untersberg cable car.\n\nJust a few hours from London by train, Liverpool is a must-visit spot for Beatles fans.\n\nAll four band members grew up in the port city. There are many different types of excursions, from short bus rides to full-day private tours that will immerse you in the sights and sounds of the band's legacy.\n\nIn Liverpool, football (or American soccer) is a way of life, and there are two main clubs here: Liverpool and Everton. Fans of the game can take an LFC stadium tour for a behind-the-scenes look.\n\nThe city also houses a slew of theaters, art galleries, and museums — and it's becoming a hot destination for shopping and unique culinary experiences.\n\nCinque Terre is one of my favorite cities — or, more accurately, my favorite collection of five villages.\n\nNestled along the Italian Riviera, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore are accessible only by train, ferry, or foot.\n\nEach has a distinct style, and hikers flock to this region to enjoy the beautiful scenery.\n\nVernazza, my favorite village, is the gem of this region. I love wandering the cobbled streets to shop, snack, and explore. You can also visit the Castello Doria or the church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia.\n\nIn the summer months, tourists sunbathe on the beaches of Monterosso or take a dip in the sea. For a history lesson, visit the remains of Castello Fieschi or the Church of St John the Baptist and the Capuchin Monastery.\n\nIn Manarola, take some time to watch locals cliff-jump into the marina. I also suggest taking a wine tour through the town to sample some local specialties. Be sure to try Sciacchetrà, a sweet but strong dessert wine produced in Cinque Terre.\n\nRiomaggiore is also home to a castle and churches dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. The center of the town is great for wandering, shopping, and eating.\n\nCorniglia is probably the quietest of the five villages. There, climb the Lardarina staircase for beautiful views of the coastline or take a boat tour to fully enjoy the area's beauty.\n\nJust about two hours east of Paris by high-speed train, Strasbourg is a beautiful city along the border of France and Germany.\n\nEvery trip should include a visit to the Gothic Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Strasbourg. Try to plan your day around arriving there at 12:30 p.m. to see the wooden figures dance around the clock.\n\nAfter your cathedral visit, stroll through Petite France, explore cheese shops, and take a break to sip a glass of wine at one of the canal's many cafés.\n\nAt the end of the year, Strasbourg is also home to one of the oldest Christmas markets, dating back to the late 1500s. The Christkindelsmärik is truly magical, with more than 300 vendors selling their holiday best.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 3, 2024, and most recently updated on January 23, 2026.",

    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. US, The Nation’s justice correspondent reminds us why government matters—and why ICE has nothing to do with actual government. Plus, Hawai’i’s brilliant legal maneuver.\n\nEarlier this week, the Trump administration attempted to prosecute journalist Don Lemon for his coverage of protests inside a Minneapolis church. The protesters had flooded the church to call for the resignation of pastor David Easterwood, who allegedly works for ICE. But on Thursday, a federal magistrate in Minnesota rejected the criminal complaint filed by the Department of Justice—a ruling that allegedly “enraged” Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nTwo activists, Nekima Levy Armstrong and Chauntyll Louisa Allen, have been arrested by the FBI in connection with the protest.\n\nThere has been a lot of naysaying about these protests, especially from “Never Trumpers.” Even as people are coalescing around the idea that ICE needs to be stopped, the sight of people protesting inside a church has given the moderates an opportunity to appear, well, moderate about the methods for dispelling ICE.\n\nI am not the protest police, but I will say that there are good First Amendment reasons to protect the sanctity of houses of worship. Protecting people from being harassed while they are inside their places of worship is the legally right thing to do to protect people’s free exercise of religion, even if we think the people worshiping are misguided or even evil in some way. Protesting outside of a person’s church (or house) is great. Protesting inside a person’s sanctuary is violative, and unnecessarily so.\n\nI’ll also point out that ICE regularly violates those sanctuaries, and that protecting people from government interference in their places of worship is even more important than protecting people from private actions.\n\nThere are even stronger First Amendment–based reasons to protect the right of journalists to cover such protests. Trying to charge Lemon for covering protests inside a church is the greater attack on the First Amendment.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of hand-wringing from online moderates over the protests inside the church. I haven’t seen enough outrage over the state harassment of a journalist like Lemon for covering the thing that alerted all the moderates to get their underwear in a bunch. I think if you are more concerned about private acts of resistance than state acts of totalitarianism, you are doing it wrong.\n\nStudentNation\n\n /\n\n Colin Warren\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nTo understand this week’s worst argument, you need to take a moment to appreciate the very best argument, which was made by the state of Hawaii. In 2022’s New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Supreme Court eviscerated gun regulations in this country. The court announced that for a gun law to exist in the modern era, it had to have some historical analogue to a gun law that existed at or before the founding of the country. To regulate an Uzi, you have to show that a “historical twin” regulation applied to a musket.\n\nThe rule is beyond stupid as an intellectual proposition, but it’s also practically unworkable. What is a close enough “historical analogue”? Nobody knows. Since Bruen, the Supreme Court has been trying to make it up as it goes along.\n\nWell, Hawaii looked at all that chaos and said “challenge accepted.” The state passed a gun law specifically designed to either meet Bruen’s preposterous criteria or, ultimately, expose the court’s deep hypocrisy when applying Bruen. The law requires gun owners to receive explicit permission from property owners before they can bring their weapons onto private property. It’s been dubbed the “vampire rule,” based on the trope that vampires need to receive permission before entering your home.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court’s own logic in Bruen, Hawaii’s law should be upheld. The state can cite historical analogues for its rules that go well beyond Nosferatu. In 1763 and 1771, New York and New Jersey respectively imposed similar restrictions.\n\nAnd yet, the law isn’t going to hold (here’s where we get to the “worst” argument part). As Ian Millhiser explains, “[I]t turns out that none of this history actually matters, as all six of the Court’s Republicans…signaled Tuesday that they are likely to strike the law down.”\n\nTo accomplish this hypocrisy, the core Republican argument was that the Second Amendment should be treated like any other constitutional right, and the government cannot essentially enact a prior restraint on constitutional rights. But that argument that the Second Amendment should be treated like any other amendment fails the Republicans’ own requirements, laid out in Bruen, that the Second Amendment is so super special that modern regulations must be tied to a specific historically analogous law before it can be enacted. No other constitutional amendment gets that protection. If the Second Amendment is to be treated like every other one, then the entire logic of Bruen should fall apart.\n\nBut the Republicans on the Supreme Court want it both ways, and since they have a supermajority, they will have it both ways. When a gun regulation doesn’t have a doppelgänger from the 18th freaking century, Republicans will strike down the law because the Second Amendment allegedly means the same thing now as it did then. When a gun regulation does have a doppelgänger from the 18th century, the Republicans will strike down the law because the Second Amendment magically means something different now from what it meant then.\n\nThe only true way to track the Republicans’ logic on the Second Amendment is to ask the question: “Will this lead to people being shot to death?” If yes, the Republicans on the Supreme Court are in favor of it.\n\nThe Supreme Court also heard oral arguments this week in Trump v. Cook, the case concerning Trump’s attempts to fire Fed Reserve Board Commissioner Lisa Cook. Most likely, this will go down as a rare loss for Trump in front of his court. Why? I explain that it’s all about the money.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nApparently, it’s going to snow this weekend. A lot. Pretty much everywhere (no, not you, San Diego. You people will continue to enjoy your perfect weather… until the earth swallows you whole).\n\nSnowstorms, and weather events in general, really highlight the isolation of the modern human condition. We don’t come together ahead of these things; we go to ground. Before Trump came to the White House, I was pretty sure that the nadir of American culture could be witnessed at a Costco 24 hours before a snowstorm or hurricane.\n\nI can’t even say the hoarding mentality is wrong, or at least I can’t say that it’s irrational, because the other thing weather events do is highlight how desperately most people rely on government services. If the government doesn’t clear the roads, people can’t get to work, including the people whose jobs are to keep all the other services and infrastructure up and running.\n\nI’m relatively privileged, but this week a small part broke in my furnace, and I was without heat for 24 hours. I was able to get it fixed but, if that had happened during the snowstorm… nobody could come to fix my problem if the city didn’t plow the roads. I need the government to function so I can even access my privilege, and I need it to function the most when things are all screwed up.\n\nBut that’s the thing about government: When it’s working, most people don’t notice it. When it’s not working, people sure as shit notice it, but most people don’t carry that knowledge through Election Day. Accountability rarely follows disaster. Last July, a rainstorm killed 27 campers and counselors at Camp Mystic in Texas; none of the politicians responsible, including Texas Governor Gregg Abbott, has paid a price for the inaction. But a couple of people have been fired from their jobs for making inappropriate social media posts after the tragedy.\n\nOf course, I’ve just explained the fundamentally asymmetrical battle Democrats have to fight every day. Republicans say government doesn’t work, then they make government not work. Then when government doesn’t work people say, “See, government doesn’t work” and vote for Republicans. Democrats say government can work, and when they make it work… nobody notices or cares.\n\nBottom line: If New York City handles the snowstorm well, I want Zorhan Mamdani doing an ad with a snow shovel saying, “you’re welcome.” Lord knows he’ll be blamed if things don’t go well, even though he hasn’t been on the job long enough to reform New York’s snow preparedness system.\n\nStay safe, and warm, this weekend. And if things go well or go to shit, try to remember why.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

    "description": "Taylor Swift's texts to Blake Lively, unsealed amid Lively's lawsuit against Justin Baldoni, showcase their bond and Swift's communication style.",
    "fullText": "Picture this: You've just received a text from Taylor Swift.\n\nIt's easy to imagine her missives resembling her famously personal song lyrics. Something honest and vulnerable, like, \"I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,\" or tender, like, \"I don't wanna miss you like this. Come back, be here,\" or even sassy, like, \"Good thing I like my friends canceled.\"\n\nWell, thanks to a slew of newly unsealed court documents, we now have evidence that's not far from the truth.\n\n\"I think I'm just exhausted in every avenue of my life,\" Swift seemingly wrote to her friend Blake Lively in December 2024. \"You don't need to apologize. Just come back please.\" Earlier that year, Swift apparently praised her longtime friend's tenacity: \"No one. Should ever. Get into a war of wills with you.\"\n\nSeveral text messages between Swift and Lively were recently made public amid Lively's legal battle with Justin Baldoni, her director and costar on the hit 2024 movie \"It Ends with Us.\" These particular texts presumably became relevant to the lawsuit because Baldoni's name was mentioned (or alluded to, as when Lively wrote to Swift about \"this doofus director of my movie\"). In some cases, they speak to Lively's state of mind while the two actors were filming \"It Ends With Us,\" and amid the breakdown of Lively and Baldoni's working relationship.\n\nDespite these nuggets of insight, however, some of the most interesting details of Lively's conversations with Swift are the ones that offer a unique glimpse into Swift's writerly craft.\n\nSwift is already renowned for her lyricism. The same week these texts were unsealed, she became the youngest woman ever to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame — in her very first year of eligibility, no less. But these texts reveal a less polished, less reputation-conscious version of Swift's communication style.\n\nAccording to these court documents, Lively texted Swift on December 4, 2024, shortly before the end of the Eras Tour, to temperature-check their friendship. Lively and Swift have been close friends for years (Swift is the godmother to Lively's children), but the actor felt that something in their dynamic had shifted.\n\n\"Hey, just checking in,\" Lively wrote to Swift. \"I have no reason to ask, but I donno, l've been feeling like I should… is everything OK?\"\n\nLively went on to say she felt like a \"bad friend lately,\" that she didn't want to come across as \"needy and awkward,\" but her gut (and her husband, Ryan Reynolds) told her to reach out anyway. \"I always want the opportunity to be a better friend if there's something I unintentionally did,\" she wrote.\n\nIf you've ever gone through a rough patch with a loved one, then this brand of ambient, unsettled anxiety will surely feel familiar. It's really hard to communicate complex emotions, especially when an important relationship is at stake, and the conversation isn't face-to-face.\n\nLuckily, written communication of complex emotions is exactly Swift's forte.\n\n\"I feel really bad saying anything about this because your texts have been so nice in their intent but your last few… it's felt like I was reading a mass corporate email sent to 200 employees,\" Swift replied in part. \"You said the word 'we' like 18 times. And it feels awful to be in any way critical of any way you process what you've been going through but I just kinda miss my funny, dark, normal-speaking friend who talks to me as herself, not like. A plural unit.\"\n\nShe added: \"I know you feel attacked from all sides for ridiculous reasons so you're feeling like you have to overly explain things or be overly nice or whatever but. It's me! That's just caused a little distance.\"\n\nSwift's response is exactly what I'd hope to receive from a friend in that position: open-hearted and generous, yet firm and forthright. She doesn't treat Lively with kid gloves, nor does she pile on. Instead, she validates her friend's anxiety, clarifies her own perspective, and reinforces their bond.\n\nOver the past two decades, Swift has built an empire by making fans feel like her friends, writing songs that sound like heart-to-hearts. It's oddly comforting to know that Swift writes to her actual friends with the same attention to detail.",

    "fullText": "Enterprise is the latest company caught in the crosshairs of anti-ICE protests.\n\nA video showing protesters lined up outside of a Minnesota Enterprise Rent-A-Car location went viral earlier this week on TikTok, part of an \"Ice out Enterprise\" protest campaign.\n\nOrganizers encouraged participants to disrupt Enterprise's operations by reserving rental cars and then canceling the bookings shortly before pickup — a tactic they say is designed to draw attention and strain vehicle availability that could be utilized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\n\"Enterprise is renting cars to ICE agents and profiting from the violence that agents are bringing to our communities,\" Minnesota organizers associated with the Sunrise Movement, a progressive climate and social justice advocacy group, posted on social media. The post asked protestors to \"please be polite to employees when you contact them.\"\n\nbrought the workers donuts too- it’s not them we’re protesting, it’s corporate policy that requires them to rent to kidnappers! hint: you can do this at your local enterprise too… #minneapolis #minnesota #ice #protest\n\nAn Enterprise employee working the counter at one of the rental car company's Saint Paul, Minnesota, locations confirmed to Business Insider on Friday that protesters had been calling the store. The employee declined to comment further, citing the company's media policy.\n\n\"I've called and told them I was disappointed that they were collaborating with ICE,\" a commenter on Instagram said.\n\n\"They answered the phone super quickly,\" another added. \"I was told a complaint would be logged right away.\"\n\nThe viral video, which was posted on Thursday, had more than 323,000 views on TikTok as of publication. It shows a line of demonstrators holding signs reading \"No cars for ICE\" and \"Cancel ICE contracts now.\"\n\nIt's unclear if Enterprise has any contract with ICE. Enterprise did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe effort is part of a \"week of actions\" in Minnesota leading up to a \"business blackout\" on Friday to protest ICE's presence in the state. The Sunrise and Sunrise Twin Cities groups didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nA post shared by Sunrise Movement - Twin Cities Hub (@sunrise.twincities)\n\nThe video has also drawn reactions from conservative commentators on X.\n\n\"Anti-ICE leftists are now booking and canceling car reservations at Enterprise to protest them renting cars to ICE,\" wrote Chaya Raichik, who operates the popular Libs of TikTik account on X, in a post with more than 208,000 views.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Business Insider in a statement that \"dangerous\" protest efforts had led to a rise in violence against ICE officers. \"ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,\" she said.\n\nEnterprise is the latest major corporation to face consumer pressure as immigration enforcement activity in Minnesota has drawn widespread protest.\n\nEarlier this month, Hilton removed a franchisee from its portfolio after a video that purported to show a hotel employee refusing to provide immigration enforcement officers rooms.\n\nIn a statement, the hotel chain criticized the operator and said its corporate policy was to make all locations \"a welcoming place for all\" and that it does \"not discriminate against any individuals or agencies.\"\n\nMinneapolis-based Target has also faced heat from activists who accused the retailer of cooperating with immigration officials. The retailer denied those claims an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.\n\n\"Target does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency,\" human resources chief Melissa Kremer wrote to employees. \"We're listening and working to de-escalate where possible.\"\n\nEnterprise, which runs around two dozen locations in the Twin Cities, is still facing calls from Minnesota-based protestors.",

    "description": "Amazon employees respond to expected layoffs and corporate job cuts by posting memes referencing  founder Jeff Bezos' two-pizza rule.",
    "fullText": "Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes.\n\nThe company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October.\n\nIn the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed.\n\nThe focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous \"two-pizza rule,\" originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.\n\nAs the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption \"how we feed two pizza teams.\"\n\nAnother image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption \"did someone say 2 pizza team?\" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal,\" one employee wrote in the Slack channel. \"Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage.\"\n\nOthers wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered \"reasonably sized.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas,\" another employee wrote.\n\nThe pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes.\n\nOne riffed on the rumored timing, splashing \"JANUARY 27TH\" over the scene from \"The Shining\" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and \"AWS\" over his face.\n\nAnother meme used the \"panik/kalm\" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words \"Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)\", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble.\n\nOther posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: \"able to login,\" \"mail and Slack works,\" and \"no random HR meeting in calendar.\"\n\nAnother simply captured the vibe in all caps: \"I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\"\n\nAmazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A report by former special counsel Jack Smith on his investigation into President Donald Trump's hoarding of classified documents belongs in the “dustbin of history\" and should remain sealed, the Justice Department said in a sharply worded court filing Friday.\n\n“The illicit product of an unlawful investigation and prosecution belongs in the dustbin of history. The United States will leave it there,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe department's position echoes that of Trump, whose lawyers this week asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to permanently block the release of the Smith report. It adds to the likelihood that a detailed report on a criminal investigation once seen as posing significant legal peril to Trump might continue to remain hidden from public view.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Biden and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, after he left the White House following his first term.\n\nBoth investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith's team after Trump's November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nThe volume on the election investigation was released in the final days of the Biden administration. But Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida who issued multiple favorable rulings for Trump and his two co-defendants in the classified documents case, last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with that case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe injunction is set to lift on February 24.\n\nBut Jason Reding Quiñones, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where the case was filed, said in a three-page court filing that the report should remain sealed. He and another prosecutor in that office, Manolo Reboso, wrote that Smith's investigation was “unlawful from its inception.”\n\nThey also wrote that Attorney General Pam Bondi had determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department.\n\n“Smith not only weaponized the Department of Justice against a leading presidential candidate in pursuit of an anti-democratic end, but he did so without legal authority and while targeting constitutionally protected activity,” the prosecutors wrote.\n\nSmith, during his testimony Thursday, defended his investigations of Trump and insisted that he had acted without regard to politics and had no second thoughts about the criminal charges he brought.\n\n“No one should be above the law in our country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,” Smith said of Trump.",

    "fullText": "Lawmakers and military families denounced President Donald Trump’s shocking remarks denigrating NATO troops who were injured and died fighting for the U.S. in Afghanistan after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump questioned whether NATO “will be there if we ever need them.”\n\n“We’ve never needed them,” he told Maria Bartiromo. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

    "title": "10 Shows Like 'Landman' You Should Should Watch Next",
    "description": "More slick dramas filled with family feuds and shady business dealings.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Sheridan and Billy Bob Thornton are such a natural pairing that it's not at all surprising that Landman has been yet another hit for the creator behind Yellowstone and it's many spin-offs. Thornton plays Billy Norris, a crackerjack consultant, fixer, and general hired gun for a major oil conglomerate in present-day West Texas. Beyond the complicated economics and politics of the oil industry, the poor guy's also dealing with extremely complicated family drama, debt, criminal ties, and substance-abuse issues. Call it Dallas for a new generation.\n\nYou can stream Landman on Paramount+, and check out these similar shows after your binge is complete.\n\nAnother Taylor Sheridan creation, this one stars Jeremy Renner as Mike McLusky, head of a family that’s been keeping the peace, more or less, in the title's company town for decades. The \"business\" of the corrupt burg just happens to be incarceration, and the McLuskys thrive when business is up, even if Mike himself has slightly different ideas about how to run things. The show deals, at least broadly, with systemic racism and inequality in the prison system, but mostly it's a modern day western about bringing justice to a corrupt town. Stream Mayor of Kingstown on Paramount+.\n\nIt's tempting to direct you back to the original series' 14-season run, but that one's a harder to stream—and besides, this direct continuation is still pretty fun. Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray and Larry Hagman (as the original's J.R.) are all back, joined by a new generation lead by Josh Henderson, Jesse Metcalf, and Jordana Brewster. They're every bit as scheming, conniving, horny, and oil obsessed as their parents. Stream Dallas on Tubi.\n\nThe Taylor Sheridan drama that launched an empire, as well as a thousand spin-offs (well, seven, including those in development). The Dutton family of Montana, owners of the largest cattle ranch in the state, deal with family and political drama—a bit like a modern Dallas, but with the vibes of HBO’s Succession. Though the main series ended after five seasons, mostly to accommodate the departure of Kevin Costner, there's plenty more to explore in the past and future of the Yellowstone universe. Stream Yellowstone on Peacock.\n\nTerrence Howard leads a truly impressive cast (among them Taraji P. Henson, Gabourey Sidibe, and Vivica A. Fox) in this juicy, glossy, hip-hop infused soap opera. Howard plays Lucious Jackson (neé drug dealer Dwight Walker), who changed his own fortunes by building Empire Entertainment from the ground up. As the series begins, the music mogul is diagnosed with ALS and given a life expectancy of only a few more years. Refusing to watch his life's work die, he sets his three sons at odds to determine who’ll be the one to control things when he’s gone. His schemes are complicated by the release from prison of Cookie Lyon (Henson), the co-founder of the company and Jackson’s ex-wife. As the kids say: drama! There's a little bit of Dallas and a little bit of Succession (which Empire predates) here, sharing with those shows and Landman the whole family dynasty thing, but with hip-hop rather than black gold. Stream Empire on Hulu and Tubi.\n\nIf the pull of Landman is Billy Bob Thornton as a complicated anti-hero with substance abuse issues, this David E. Kelley legal drama will work just fine as a streamalike, even in the absence of oil wells. Here, Thornton plays Billy McBride, a once-successful lawyer who left the firm he built after a murder suspect he'd gotten acquitted went on to kill his family. After a long run of doing not much other than drinking, he's drawn back into the fray when a dead man's sister asks for his help on a case involving his old firm, a major corporation, and some very crooked cops. Stream Goliath on Prime Video.\n\nAmerican TV shows tend to view the wealthy with nuance, even when they're engaged in overtly criminal behavior. South Korean creators, on the other hand, have no problem criticizing the 1% (Parasite and Squid Game are hardly outliers), particularly the plutocratic chaebol families who control huge portions of the country’s economy. The minseries Mine centers the women who are jockeying for control of the massive, fictional Hyowon Group from within their family’s outrageously opulent (and extremely photogenic) residential compound. The plans of two increasingly powerful women who married into the family, Hi-soo and Seo-hyun, are thrown into disarray when the new housemaid begins a romantic relationship with one of the male heirs, while a new tutor seems ready to expose old family secrets. It’s very much a Dynasty-style soap opera, with various family members crawling over each other seeking control and a sense of identity. Stream Mine on Netflix.\n\nSwapping big-time oil for a family fishing business may seem like a big leap, but we've still got plenty of crime and drugs in this Netflix series. Holt McCallany plays Harlan Buckley, returning to manage the family business, one which is tied up with multiple dueling drug cartels, as well as unreliable family members and at least one (Supergirl's Melissa Benoist) who's looking to escape her own legal problems by working with the FBI against her father and brother. Stream The Waterfront on Netflix.\n\nA vibe match that, while it doesn't replicate Landman's family and business drama, still runs with the neo-western feel that defines a Taylor Sheridan show. Michael Dorman stars as Joe Pickett, a Wyoming game warden with a violent past and, well, a violent present too. Dorman's Pickett is less of a tough action hero type, and more of a likable, everyday guy who just happens to be wrapped up in a murder via his day job. It’s not a comedy, but is definitely a bit weirder and more surreal than the more literal style of something like Landman, which lacks flourishes like Pickett's memorable emu wrestling scene. Stream Joe Pickett on Paramount+.\n\nAnother intense family business drama with a dash of a succession crisis: In Queen Sugar, three largely estranged siblings in distant cities are brought together by the death of their father, who has left them each an equal share in an 800-acre sugarcane farm in rural Louisiana. The Ava DuVernay-produced (and sometimes directed) series offers plenty of scandal and soapy drama, but ultimately, it’s a show about a family coming back together to preserve its legacy. The siblings (Rutina Wesley, Dawn-Lyen Gardner, and Kofi Siriboe) are a bit less gritty and troubled than the Norris family (they're mostly trying to do the right thing), but they still generate enough drama to fuel seven successful seasons. Stream Queen Sugar on Hulu.\n\nThe popularity of Taylor Sheridan-esque neo-westerns leads us, inevitably, to something closer to an actual western. In this series, adapting Philipp Meyer's 2013 Pulitzer Prize-finalist novel of the same name, Pierce Brosnan plays Eli McCullough, a ruthless cattle baron making moves to get in on the burgeoning oil industry in the Rio Grande Valley of 1915. A parallel narrative sees Eli as a young man, kidnapped and raised among a Nʉmʉnʉʉ family. While his backstory lends the character welcome complexity, in the present, he's as determined to build his empire as he is to prepare his son and grandson to take over when he's gone. Stream The Son on Prime Video and AMC+.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only “for cause,” which is often interpreted to mean neglect of duty or malfeasance.\n\nLast year, the court allowed President Donald Trump to fire — at least temporarily — Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but it carved out a distinction for the Fed. The two officials had argued that if Trump could fire them, he could also fire members of the Fed’s board of governors.\n\n“We disagree,” the court said then. “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”\n\nThat is now being put to the test in a case in front of the Supreme Court involving Trump's attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job.\n\nAllowing Cook’s firing to go forward “would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three Trump appointees on the nation’s highest court.\n\nBut the court largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?\n\nSeveral legal experts say the justices are on shaky ground. The Fed, they argue, is similar in many ways to the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, agencies Congress intended to be independent but whose officials Trump has been able to fire without pushback from the high court.\n\n“There’s no historical grounds for distinguishing the Fed from other independent agencies that Congress has designed,” said Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University. “The whole argument was premised on the idea that the Fed is different. They haven’t explained exactly why.”\n\nPeter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, added, “I’ll say as a legal scholar and as a historian I think that differentiation is hocus pocus.”\n\nJust last month, the court signaled in a separate oral argument that it would likely allow Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The conservative majority on the court also suggested it would overturn a 90-year-old precedent that sharply limited the president's ability to fire top officials at independent agencies.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and many of his colleagues support the “unitary executive\" theory, which holds that the president should have full sway over the staffing of agencies in the executive branch.\n\nAgency directors, like Slaughter, “are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries” without being accountable to anyone, Kavanaugh said at the December oral argument.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve, however, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have applied a different view: that the Fed’s monetary policy — the setting of short-term interest rates and management of the money supply — historically hasn’t been overseen by the executive branch.\n\nSome legal experts have likewise drawn a distinction between the Fed and other independent agencies. In a brief filed in the Cook case, Aaron Nielson, a law professor at the University of Texas, and formerly a top lawyer in Texas government, wrote that, “Whereas the modern FTC indisputably exercises executive power, the Fed's core function is monetary policy, which need not and often does not require executive power.\"\n\nThe First and Second Banks of the United States were nationwide banks that were the closest the United States had to a central bank in the first few decades after the nation's founding, and both “conducted early monetary policy,\" Nielson wrote, but weren't executive branch agencies.\n\nBut Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed, argued that the Fed does exercise executive power when it regulates the banking system. And monetary policy, when it adjusts the money supply, is part of that regulation, he said.\n\nThere are also only three types of government authority, Menand argues: legislative, executive, and judicial, and the Fed belongs in the executive category.\n\n“There is no fourth type of government power,” Menand said. \"There is no other place to locate the Fed.”\n\nStill, the justices mostly avoided addressing why the Fed is different during Wednesday's oral argument, in part, Menand noted, because neither side pushed it. Cook's lawyers had no reason to question a distinction that appeared to favor them.\n\nAnd even the government's own top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, acknowledged that Trump could only fire Cook “for cause,” while in the other cases the White House had sought to remove officials for any reason, including policy differences. The distinction made it harder for the White House to argue that Cook should immediately be removed from office.\n\n“There is a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of executive influence,\" Sauer said. “And we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing.”\n\nPaul Clement, one of Cook's lawyers, told the justices, “it’s kind of why this case is, I think, problematic for the government because they could have come in here and said, you know, Fed, schmed, it’s not that different. This is just like the FTC.”\n\nInstead, Clement added, “they come in and say, no, we’re going to accept that the Fed is different, at least for purposes of this case.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court will initially rule on the narrow question of whether Cook can remain in her position while the larger dispute over her firing is fought in the lower courts. Still, at some point it may have to issue more comprehensive rulings that could include a fuller explanation of why the justices see the Fed as different.\n\nFor now, the Fed's size and impact on the financial markets may be offering it a measure of protection.\n\n“I don’t mean to denigrate any other agency, but there’s a reason that monetary policy has been treated differently, for lo these many years,” Clement said. “And there’s a reason that the markets watch the Fed a little more closely than they watch really any other agency of government.”",

    "title": "How to Survive a Massive Winter Storm",
    "description": "Rule number one: stay inside.",
    "fullText": "With a historically bad winter storm expected to bring snow, ice, and sub-zero wind chills to many parts of the United States this weekend, it's a good time to make sure you're prepared for a potentially life-threatening disaster.\n\nWhile winter storms are generally less deadly than hurricanes and heat waves, they can be extremely dangerous, particularly when extremely cold, wind, and ice storms cause power outages. But with a little preparation and common sense, you should be all right when it gets extra snowy and cold. Here are some tips and instructions for blizzard and winter storm survival.\n\nThe map above, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center shows the predicted course of the storm through Jan. 26. You can click the link to dig into predicted snow amounts, ice accumulation, and more, but the overall picture is a huge storm that is likely to affect more than 172 million people in the U.S. and bring record low temperatures. If you're anywhere in the affected area, take time to plan for a potential snow-and-cold disaster before it happens.\n\nFor a winter storm, you want to prepare for a few cold days without power. You should have a basic survival bag tucked away in an easy-to-access spot in your house for any disaster. According to the government, a boilerplate emergency kit will contain:\n\nWater and non-perishable food for several days\n\nExtra cell phone battery or charger\n\nBattery-powered or hand crank radio that can receive NOAA Weather Radio tone alerts and extra batteries\n\nDust mask to help filter contaminated air, and plastic sheeting and duct tape to shelter in place\n\nMoist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties for personal sanitation\n\nNon-sparking wrench or pliers to turn off utilities\n\nCan opener (if your kit contains canned food)\n\nExtra clothing and blankets (although I bet you already know where these are in your home)\n\nFor winter storm saftey, I'd add a carbon monoxide detector, just to be as safe as possible when shut up inside your house. Here’s a handy shopping list you can take to the supermarket, complete with “extra credit” items like prescriptions medicine and games to keep you busy.\n\nIf you only follow one rule for blizzard survival, make it this one: Do not be outside during a winter storm. If you’re home, you probably won’t be snowbound for more than a week (and even that is unlikely), and you’ll be much warmer than if you were outside.\n\nIf you are home during a blizzard or winter storm (and you should be) take the following steps:\n\nDon’t forget your pets. Bring them inside, too.\n\nBe able to access multiple sources of information about the weather, from the internet, to television, to radio, and make sure you can get updates even if the power goes out.\n\nIf you have electric heat, crank it up as the storm approaches in case you lose power.\n\nStay in a small, insulated area: To conserve heat, stay in one room as much as possible.\n\nStuff towels and rags under doors to conserve heat.\n\nBe careful with alternative heaters like kerosene. They can start a fire, and if not properly ventilated, you can die from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nCover windows at night but uncover them during day to catch any heat from sunlight.\n\nSave batteries: Use your phone to check in on friends, family and neighbors by or to call authorities only.\n\nAs cold weather approaches, you may hear difference kinds of buzzwords for approaching storms on your NOAA weather radio and from other sources. Here’s a crash course on the relevant winter weather warnings from the National Weather Service, and what they mean, with the most severe listed first.\n\nA warning indicates an 80% or greater probability of conditions that pose a threat to life or property, and that travel will become difficult to impossible. In other words: “This storm is serious business.”\n\nBlizzard Warning: A blizzard warning means that the following conditions are occurring or expected within the next 12 to 18 hours: Snow and/or blowing snow reducing visibility to 1/4 mile or less for three hours or longer, and sustained winds of 35 mph or greater or frequent gusts to 35 mph or greater.\n\nWinter Storm Warning: A winter storm warning is issued when a significant combination of hazardous winter weather is occurring or imminent. That means five inches or more of snow/sleet within a 12-hour period or seven inches or more of snow/sleet within a 24-hour period, and/or enough ice accumulation to cause damage to trees or power lines. It also can mean a life-threatening or damaging combination of snow and/or ice accumulation with wind.\n\nWatches are intended to provide enough lead time so you can make plans to stay safe. They are usually issued a day or so before the predicted event when there’s a greater than 50% chance of it happening.\n\nWinter Storm Watch: A winter storm watch is issued when there is the potential for significant and hazardous winter weather within 48 hours. This doesn’t mean that significant and hazardous winter weather will occur—it only means it is possible.\n\nBlizzard Watch: This means conditions are favorable for a blizzard event—low visibility with winds of at least 35 mph.\n\nWinter storm advisories indicate that less serious (but still concerning) weather conditions are possible. Remember, though, a storm can change from one condition to another, so keep checking back. Go to the National Weather Service’s site for more in-depth weather-warning information.\n\nBeing trapped in your car during a snow-mergency is bad, but not necessarily deadly. Here’s a detailed trapped-in-your-car survival guide, but here are the main points:\n\nDon’t panic: As survival scenarios go, being trapped in a car in a snowstorm is not that bad. It definitely beats being trapped in a snowstorm without a car.\n\nMake sure your tailpipe is not clogged: When you first realize you are trapped, check the exhaust pipe to make sure it’s clear. You don’t want to die of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nIndicate you are in distress to the outside world: Call 911 if you can. Tie a brightly colored cloth or ribbon to your antenna or door. If the snow stops, raise your hood.\n\nStay in your vehicle: A car is an excellent survival shelter—a guy in Sweden survived in his car for two months, and he didn’t even seem to have had food or water. It is a bad idea to go walking around in a blizzard. You will get lost, cold, wet, and maybe even hit by another driver.\n\nBundle up: Wear as many layers as you can with the extra clothing you packed.\n\nCreate as small a space as possible: If you have blankets or jackets, create a little “fort” for yourself. A smaller space is easier to heat. You could try lining the windows with newspaper or those discarded fast food bags you never cleaned up.\n\nRun your car for 10 minutes an hour: Experts recommend starting your car and running the heater, hazard lights, and dome light for about 10 minutes per hour. Roll down the window a crack while the engine is running to avoid the possibility of inhaling carbon monoxide. Other than cold, carbon monoxide is your biggest danger.\n\nDon’t play on your phone: I know it’s boring to sit in the car for so long, but only use your cell to call emergency numbers. Don’t be surprised if the authorities tell you to “sit tight,” though.\n\nIf you run out of water, drink melted snow: You can get a little moisture into your body by drinking melted snow.\n\nSo you didn’t listen when I said to stay home, huh? Now you’re stumbling blindly through a snowstorm and freezing to death. I won’t sugar coat it: things are bad for you, and your survival depends on the severity of the storm. But here’s what to do:\n\nFind shelter: Get out of the wind and snow. Don’t try to make it home or wherever else you’re going if there’s somewhere safe you can wait things out.\n\nCover up your exposed flesh: I imagine this would occur to you anyway, but just in case it doesn’t, cover up as much as possible to stay warm and avoid frostbite.\n\nBuild a shelter: The National Weather Service recommends the following if you can’t find a shelter: “Build a lean-to, windbreak, or snow cave for protection from the wind. Build a fire for heat and to attract attention. Place rocks around the fire to absorb and reflect heat.” I think they’re being very optimistic. During a serious blizzard, like Minnesota’s “Children’s Blizzard” of 1888, people died yards from their houses because they got disoriented and snow-blind, so you’re probably not going to have time to build an igloo or whatever in a real blizzard. But learn wilderness survival tactics if you are likely to be at risk.\n\nMelt snow for water: Melting snow for water is OK, but don’t eat it frozen—that will lower your body temperature.",

    "title": "Google Chrome Is About to Drop Support for These Macs",
    "description": "If you have an older Mac, your time with Chrome may be ending.",
    "fullText": "Nothing lasts forever, and technology is no exception. As shiny and new as your computer was when you first bought it, eventually, developers will drop support for it. There's no telling when exactly, but at some point, you'll open an app to find a message that reads something like: \"This device does not support the latest version of this app. Please update your hardware.\"\n\nThat goes for Macs, as well. You might forget that fact, since Apple's computers tend to stick around for a long time. But inevitably, the shadow of end-of-life policies comes for them, too. If you're still rocking an older Mac, I have some bad news, specifically if you use Chrome: Google is officially planning its last supported version of the browser.\n\nGoogle quietly announced the news in a post on the Chrome Platform Status site. The company confirmed that Chrome 150 will be the last version of the browser to support macOS 12, otherwise known as macOS Monterey. Once Google eventually releases Chrome 151, users on macOS 12 will not be able to install it, and will forever be stuck on Chrome 150. Google hasn't said when Chrome 150 will actually drop (we're currently on Chrome 143), but MacRumors estimates it'll be sometime in mid-2026, based on past releases.\n\nBefore you panic, know there are a couple caveats here. First, Chrome will not stop working on macOS 12 once version 151 drops. You'll still be able to use Chrome as you always have. In fact, you might not even notice the difference, minus any new features and changes that Google rolls out in future software versions. You will see an alert that your browser is out of date, but it'll still get you to YouTube, Gmail, and Lifehacker.\n\nThis version of macOS is also fairly outdated. Google isn't just picking last year's macOS version, or the one before that. We're currently on macOS 26, which for these purposes, could be read as macOS 16. It's the fourth version of macOS since Monterey, meaning unless you know your Mac is running macOS 12, there's a good chance you're running something that Chrome still supports.\n\nIf you aren't sure, click the Apple in the top-left corner, then choose \"About This Mac.\" Here, you'll find the macOS version next to \"macOS.\"\n\nLet's say your Mac is running macOS 12. If so, you really should stop using Chrome once version 151 drops. That's because you'll no longer receive Google's latest security updates for the browser, which puts your machine (and its data) at risk.\n\nOnce Chrome 150 drops, bad actors will look for security vulnerabilities in the code to exploit. Google will do the same, and will patch any it or any third-party researchers find. Once 151 comes out, it'll include those patches, but Chrome 150 users will be left behind. The risk only grows as new vulnerabilities are discovered, and new versions of Chrome come out.\n\nAs such, you have a couple of options if you're running macOS 12. The first is to update your OS, if you have that choice. If your Mac does support macOS 13 or newer, updating will open you up to new versions of Chrome. Of course, perhaps the reason you're running macOS 12 is because you cannot update. While that largely affects Macs that are at least 10 years old, there are still plenty of these machines out there. There are alternative ways to update your older Mac, even if Apple won't let you, such as with OpenCore Legacy Patcher, but that might be too technical a route for some.\n\nThe other option here is to stop using Chrome, and switch to a browser that does support macOS 12. Firefox, for example, supports macOS 10.15 or later, and Microsoft Edge fully supports macOS 12 and later. (Safari itself hasn't been updated on macOS 12 since July 2024.)\n\nIt isn't fun watching your tech grow old, but you don't need to chuck your Mac just because Chrome will end support this year—even if the newest ones are really good.",

    "title": "Tesla Has Dropped This Basic Autopilot Feature, Forcing US Drivers Into Subscriptions",
    "description": "Other brands will continue to offer similar features at no extra cost.",
    "fullText": "If you're in the market for a new Tesla, your fancy new electric car is going to be a little less smart—unless you pony up for a subscription. According to reporting from Elektrek and buying experiences from drivers, the company is ditching the basic Autopilot mode that used to come standard in new vehicles, and is now pushing buyers to \n\nBefore, Autopilot consisted of two minor but helpful driving assist features. The first was Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which automatically adjusts speed based on the speed limit and surrounding cars, and the second was Autosteer, which helps keep you in the center of your lane. The idea was that, while highway driving, you could turn on Autopilot and essentially let your car drive itself (while still remaining attentive and aware, of course).\n\nNow, though, Autosteer will only be available as part of a Full Self-Driving, or FSD, subscription. Traffic Aware Cruise Control will still come standard on new vehicles, but highway drivers who aren't paying Tesla a monthly fee will now need to make tiny corrections every once in a while to keep from veering into the wrong lane.\n\nMaking its cars dumber by default is an odd move for a company that wants to be seen as cutting-edge, although if removing Autopilot encourages more FSD subscriptions, that would see more users with Tesla's most-advanced self-driving tech on the road. Unfortunately, that goal will be pretty costly for consumers. A Full Self-Driving subscription currently costs $99 per month, although until Feb. 14, you are able to buy a lifetime FSD subscription for $8,000.\n\nWhich features you'd get with an FSD sub depends on what's legally available in your area, but in addition to bringing back Autosteer, upgrading could also net you assistance with parking, pickups, and lane changes. However, if all you want is to get your basic functionality back, disgruntled drivers are pointing out that the discontinued features continue to be offered standard on lower-cost models from competing brands, like Toyota.\n\nThe move to push Full Self-Driving subscriptions also comes alongside a promise from Tesla owner Elon Musk that pricing for the feature will go up as it improves, although the statement seemed to mostly focus on hopes of a future unsupervised FSD mode rather than more minor upgrades.\n\nAt any rate, it's getting more expensive to buy a Tesla that lives up to the futuristic dreams the marketing promises. The company does still offer a slightly less expensive $6,000 \"Enhanced Autopilot\" add-on in some international regions, which combines the features from basic Autopilot with a few FSD features, but North American customers will now have no choice but to subscribe.",

The encampment was near Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King had preached and now the site of annual events to honor him.\n\nPartners for HOME is the city's lead agency on homelessness. SafeHouse Outreach is another Atlanta nonprofit that serves unhoused people. The lawsuit says the organizations should have known to check Taylor's tent after they did outreach at the site in advance.\n\nCathryn Vassell, CEO of Partners for HOME, said the nonprofit cannot comment on the lawsuit because they have not seen it but “is committed to its mission making homelessness in Atlanta rare, brief and nonrecurring.\" SafeHouse Outreach did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTaylor's family sued the city of Atlanta in July, alleging city employees also should have checked whether Taylor was in his tent.\n\nTaylor’s death sparked outrage among local advocates and neighbors at the encampment who at the time called the city’s policies on clearing encampments inhumane. They said the city faces a dire affordable housing shortage that makes it inevitable that people will end up living on the streets.\n\nRight after Taylor’s death, the city put a temporary moratorium on encampment sweeps. With the FIFA World Cup coming to Atlanta this Summer, the city has since resumed clearing encampments with the goal of eliminating all homelessness in the downtown area before then. Partners for HOME is close to its goal of housing 400 people ahead of the World Cup, said Vassell.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Friday seeks unspecified damages as well as compensation for medical and hospital bills, burial costs, attorney’s fees and litigation costs.\n\nHarold Spence, one of the lawyers representing the family, said at a news conference Friday that city officials and the nonprofit employees didn’t want the “dignitaries” attending the Martin Luther King Jr. event to see the encampment.\n\n“They were in a rush to remove it,” Spence said. “Unfortunately, it turned out they were willing to remove it at any cost.”\n\nSpence added that Taylor had recently secured a job and was ready to “turn his life around.”\n\nKramon is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "title": "Google's AI-Generated Headlines Are Here to Stay",
    "description": "That clickbait title might have been written by AI.",
    "fullText": "Last month, Google told online publishers that it had started testing AI-generated headlines in Google Discover, replacing stories' carefully handcrafted titles with truncated alternatives made up by Gemini. Some journalists were predictably unhappy, but now, the company says that the AI headlines are no longer an experiment—they're a \"feature.\"\n\nBack when the testing began, the results ranged from poorly worded to straight up misinformation. For instance, one AI-generated headline promised \"Steam Machine price revealed,\" when the original article made no such claim. Another said \"BG3 players exploit children,\" which sounds serious, until you click through to the article and see that it's about a clever way to recruit invincible party members in Baldur's Gate 3 (which, to be fair, does involve turning child NPCs into sheep at one point).\n\nAt the time, Google said that the test was a \"small UI experiment for a subset of Discover users,\" and simply rearranged how users saw AI previews, which were introduced in October of last year and feature short AI summaries of articles, including an occasional AI headline. However, while that AI headline was previously hidden below the original, authored headline, the test put it up top, while getting rid of the authored headline entirely.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like Google might have been willing to back away from the AI headlines, but now the company says it's doubling down. In a statement to The Verge, Google said that its AI headlines are no longer in testing, but are now a full-fledged feature. The company didn't elaborate on why, but did say that the update \"performs well for user satisfaction.\"\n\nWhen 9to5Google then reached out for more detail, the publication was told, \"The overview headline reflects information across a range of sites, and is not a rewrite of an individual article headline.\"\n\nWell, that hasn't quite been the case for me: When I first wrote about this \"experiment,\" I actually had yet to run into one of the AI headlines. But perusing my Google Discover feed today (to see yours, swipe right from the home screen on an Android phone, or scroll down in the Google app), I've finally seen some first hand. To Google's credit, these AI previews do seem to synthesize several sources as claimed—you can see them above the linked story. However, they still call out one article in particular, linking to it and using its header photo. That can easily lead users to think the AI generated headline was written by the linked publication.\n\nThat can have consequences for the publication or writer if the AI gets something wrong, which a disclaimer at the bottom of these AI previews admits can happen. For instance, The Verge said it saw an AI Discover headline on a story from Lifehacker's sister site PCMag that said, \"US reverses foreign drone ban,\" even though the linked story goes out of its way to say headlines that claim this are \"misleading.\"\n\nThe AI headlines I've seen personally haven't been quite that bad, but as someone with a more than decade-long career in journalism, I do question their helpfulness. For instance, \"Starfleet Academy full of Trek Nods\" is much less informative than the original, \"One of TNG's Strangest Species Is Getting a Second Life In Modern Star Trek.\" I guess \"Star Trek show has Star Trek things\" is apparently clickier or more useful to the reader than just saying what the specific Star Trek thing is?\n\nAnother example: \"Anbernic unveils RG G01 Controller.\" I hope you know what those letters and numbers mean, because this AI headline completely buries the context in the original headline, \"Anbernic's New Controller Has a Screen and Built-In Heartbeat Sensor, for Some Reason.\"\n\nI guess this is a future that I'll have to get used to though. That I'm starting to see these headlines myself, despite not being part of the initial experiment, does suggest we can expect them to stick around, and to roll out to more people. If you see something that seems questionable while scrolling Google Discover, the feature has probably rolled out to you now too.\n\nTo check whether that suspicious headline was written by a human or not, try clicking the \"See more\" button at the bottom of the article's description and looking for a \"Generated with AI\" disclaimer.\n\nOn the plus side, only about half of the articles in my Google Discover are currently using AI headlines, so not every piece of \"content\" is being affected. But for journalists, the move still comes at a tough time: According to Reuters, Google traffic from organic search was down by 38% on test sites in the United Stated between November 2024 and November 2025, and while Google Discover isn't Search, editors write headlines the way they do for a reason. Using a robot to overwrites those decisions probably isn't the best way to tackle eroding trust in media.\n\nI've reached out to Google for comment on its AI headlines and will provide an update when I hear back.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Ratti, Hopkins, Morse, Kasende Cons: Edwards 2\n\nTries: F Horn 2, PJ Botha, Q Horn Cons: Smith 2\n\nOspreys finished a traumatic week by battling to a bonus-point draw with Lions in the United Rugby Championship (URC).\n\nWales fly-half Dan Edwards missed a 79th penalty which would have won the game for the hosts, while Lions wing Angelo Davids spurned a last-gasp try.\n\nIt had been an emotional few days after it emerged Ospreys owners, Y11 Sport and Media, are in talks to buy Welsh rivals Cardiff.\n\nThe move is threatening the Ospreys' future as a professional side beyond 2027 and provided a troubled build-up for Mark Jones' side.\n\nThey handled the situation professionally in atrocious conditions with tries from flanker James Ratti, full-back Iestyn Hopkins, number eight Morgan Morse and wing Daniel Kasende.\n\nLions responded with two tries from captain Francke Horn and further scores from hooker PJ Botha and full-back Quon Horn.\n\nWales captain Dewi Lake escaped a red card for a dangerous tackle as the Ospreys hooker was one of four players sin-binned during a physical encounter.\n\nLions remain in seventh place, while Ospreys rise one spot to eighth and into the play-off places.\n\nIt was six days between Ospreys' previous home game against Montpellier and this occasion.\n\nGiven the build-up, it must have seemed much longer for players, coaches and supporters.\n\nThe Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has proposed cutting one of its four men's professional sides - Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets - to the dismay of many fans across the country.\n\nIt was the Ospreys that have found themselves in the firing line this week.\n\nOn Monday evening, news emerged that Ospreys' owners were the preferred bidders in a deal to purchase Cardiff from the WRU.\n\nThis was not confirmed officially by the WRU and Ospreys until Thursday and this period of flux created panic and uncertainty in the ranks of players, coaches, staff and supporters.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Ospreys had a stormy meeting with chief executive Lance Bradley where \"one or two of the players\" walked out early and a full contact training session was cancelled.\n\nThe following day, head coach Jones faced the press where he said the Ospreys squad had been told of the Y11 interest in Cardiff and stated they had no clarity on the future.\n\nIt was not until 24 hours later that the news was confirmed, when it was unveiled both Cardiff and Ospreys would continue as separate teams but both be owned by Y11.\n\nThe only guarantee given to the Ospreys was they would play in the URC and Europe competitions until after the end of next season.\n\nThere have been no assurances Ospreys will remain a professional side after the summer of 2027.\n\nAll this turmoil when they had an important game to prepare for. An occasion when centre Keiran Williams ran out for his 100th Ospreys game. A landmark that should be celebrated but had been overshadowed.\n\nOspreys are currently playing out of Bridgend this season where a crowd of 4,052 turned out to watch in wet and windy conditions.\n\nFans were asked to light their phone torches on 11 minutes as a message to say \"they will not ignore the disgraceful treatment of Ospreys players, staff, and supporters\".\n\nThe crowd obliged and there were resounding boos directed towards rugby bosses.\n\nOspreys staff had been in tears this week not knowing what the future holds and that frustration was shared by the fans.\n\nLynne Jones, of Ospreys Supporters Club said she feels let down by the WRU and Y11.\n\n\"I'm emotional, angry and upset, it's devastating,\" she told BBC Wales Today.\n\n\"The silence from the WRU - it's not on.\"\n\nSarah Collins-Davies, chair of the Ospreys Supporters Club added: \"It's been an emotional week for the supporters, but I can't imagine how difficult it has been for the players and coaches.\n\nOspreys supporter Annette Davies says she is fearful for the future with so many unanswered questions.\n\n\"There has to be clarity,\" said Davies.\n\n\"We're told there will be an Ospreys side next season - what does that mean? Are we ending next season? Are we even going to have the players to have a season, because we have a lot of players out of contract.\n\n\"Who's going to want to sign for us? Knowing they might not be here at the end of that following season.\"\n\nThe Ospreys have produced Wales and British and Irish Lions internationals like Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Biggar, Adam Jones, Shane Williams and Justin Tipuric and attracted star names like Justin Marshall, Tommy Bowe, Jerry Collins, Marty Holah and Ryan Jones.\n\nThey are the most successful Welsh team in terms of silverware since the inception of regional rugby in 2003, although their last trophy was in 2012.\n\nAn illustrious past. But what an uncertain future looks like, remains to be seen.\n\nOspreys: Hopkins; Kasende, Watkin, K Williams, Giles; Edwards, Hardy; S Thomas, Lake (capt), Botha, R Davies, R Smith, Ratti, Deaves, Morgan.\n\nReplacements: L Lewis, C Jones, Hire, L Jones, Moriarty, Morse, Morgan-Williams, Cokanasiga.\n\nLions: Horn; Davids, van Wyk, Mills, R Kriel; M van den Berg, Smith; Kotze, PJ Botha, Ntlabakanye, Schoeman, Nothnagel, R du Plessis, Hlekani, F Horn (capt).\n\nReplacements: Brandon, RF Schoeman, C van Vuuren, E Oosthuizen, Landsberg, Cairns, Pead, E Cronje.\n\nSin-bin: Kotze 38, E Oosthuizen 66\n\nReferee: Federico Vedovelli (Italy)\n\nAssistant referees: Adam Jones (Wales), Lucas Yendle (Wales)",

    "fullText": "United Rugby Championship, Musgrave Park\n\nTries: Kleyn, Coombes 2 Cons: Butler 2 Pens: Butler\n\nTries: Coghlan, Richards Cons: O'Brien 2 Pens: O'Brien 2\n\nTwo tries from second-half replacement Gavin Coombes helped Munster come from behind to beat Dragons 22-20 at Musgrave Park.\n\nThe victory brought an end to Munster's four-game losing streak in all competitions but, after their Champions Cup exit last week, the hosts struggled early in their return to United Rugby Championship (URC) action and they twice found themselves 13 points behind.\n\nDragons will certainly feel they could have taken more than a losing bonus from the fixture but, despite tries for Brodie Coghlan and David Richards, they ended the game holding on to even that consolation as Munster chased in vain for a fourth try.\n\nThe win lifts Munster into third in the URC, although having played two games more than Ulster directly below them in the table.\n\nThe talking points from Ireland's Six Nations squad\n\nHaving lost six of their past eight games and suffered the massive blow of a pool-stage Champions Cup exit last weekend, there was little in the opening exchanges to suggest a change in Munster's fortunes.\n\nWhile the hosts did start playing into the wind, they could get little purchase early in the game and Dragons were good value for the13-0 lead they built across the first half hour of play.\n\nExperienced full-back Angus O'Brien kicked a pair of penalties either side of hooker Brodie Coghlan's try from the back of a menacing maul.\n\nDragons were unflustered even by the yellow card shown to Harry Beddall for taking out Thaakir Abrahams in the air and, after the flanker's return from his 19th-minute yellow card, the visitors thought they had extended their lead further.\n\nScrum-half Che Hope did excellently to win the race to David Richards' kick ahead but, upon review, it was ruled that the Munster carrier had got a knee to ground just prior to Beddall's strip.\n\nThat decisions loomed all the larger when, just 90 seconds before the interval, Munster's Springbok lock Jean Kleyn muscled over from close range.\n\nThere was a similar momentum swing to start the second half when Munster's maul looked to put the pressure on the Dragons in the corner. With a score seeming likely, instead the ball popped out and Rio Dyer gathered before racing away from danger.\n\nJust three minutes later, Dragons made the most of the escape with a well-worked try from deep as Tinus de Beer chased and caught his own kick before putting Richards across.\n\nLeading 20-7 with 28 minutes remaining, Dragons' will have felt a first league win outside of Wales since October 2021 was there for the taking.\n\nBut with Coombes emerging from the bench as a replacement for Kleyn, it was Munster who instead ended their own unwanted winless streak.\n\nThe 28-year-old was perhaps fortunate that Hollie Davidson's on-field decision had been to award a try when replays of the grounding of his first score in the 57th minute appeared inconclusive.\n\nThere was no doubt about his second, however, from similarly close range with the score and subsequent conversion bringing Munster back within a point with 15 minutes to go.\n\nThe comeback was complete 10 minutes later as Tony Butler's straightforward penalty from in front of the posts gave Munster their first lead of the game.\n\nTwice Munster would take aim for the corner in the closing stages but one effort was kicked dead while a second, from a brilliant 50:22, led only to a line-out that saw them held up over the line.\n\nInstead, four points would be their reward from a night when Clayton McMillan's side again failed to convince.\n\nMunster: Haley; Abrahams, Kelly, Nankivell, Daly; Hanrahan, Coughlan; Loughman, D Barron (C), Ala'alatoa, Kleyn, F Wycherley, S Edogbo, Quinn, Gleeson.\n\nReplacements: L Barron, J Wycherley, Jager, O'Connell, Coombes, Patterson, Butler, Kilgallen.\n\nDragons: O'Brien; Richards, Inisi, Owen, Dyer; de Beer, Hope; Martinez, Coghlan, Hunt, Douglas, Carter, Keddie, Beddall, Wainwright.\n\nReplacements: Burrows, Morris, Dlamini, S Davies, Lewis-Hughes, R Williams, Ackerman, C Evans.",

Many of the posts appeared in his feed twice in a row.\n\nTrump, 79, began his posting spree by claiming he had helped to save TikTok by announcing the Chinese social media company would now operate in the U.S. under a majority American-owned joint venture.\n\nRepublican megadonor Larry Ellison’s company Oracle will hold a 15 percent stake in TikTok U.S. Ellison, a close friend of Trump, will also steer Oracle’s “retraining” of TikTok’s trademark algorithm.\n\n“It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”\n\nIronically, Trump had tried to ban TikTok in 2020, citing national security fears, but used the Chinese-owned app to broaden his appeal with younger voters during his 2024 election campaign.\n\nTrump’s dump of posts covered everything from a trailer for wife Melania’s Amazon documentary to reposting video from Fox News and Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nThere were also clips of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and uploaded PDF printouts of a NewsMax cover story on Trump from December.\n\nThe president also shared negative posts towards his political foes, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHis feed was also filled with doubled-up posts about the 2020 election being stolen, clips from UFC boss Dana White, and claims that he is having success with his handling of the American economy—despite polls suggesting otherwise.\n\nHe also shared content from a fan account dedicated to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Unfortunately for Trump, one of the posts read “American is back!!!” rather than “America is back!!!”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s post-midnight Truth Social onslaught follows an earlier social media frenzy from Europe. He spent more than an hour firing off posts attacking his critics and sharing gushing posts after the embarrassment of world leaders snubbing his “Board of Peace” signing ceremony.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nHe included more conspiracy theories about the 2020 election fraud as well as questionable claims about ICE being allowed to use force against Minnesota protesters.",

This is something really, really special.\"\n\nUnderstandably the comments angered the Football Supporters' Association, which accused Infantino of making \"cheap jokes\" about England fans.\n\nThe terminology \"Brits\" may well have annoyed fans from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland too.\n\nA lot has been done to try to repair England's name at major tournaments after it hit one of its lowest points on the international stage at Euro 2000. That was after a long history of hooliganism.\n\nSo what do the World Cup statistics show? Was the lack of arrests in Qatar unusual?

    "description": "A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.  U.S.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ashley Royal found the government should have sued Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Atlanta, and not in a separate federal judicial district in Macon, where the secretary of state also has an office.\n\nRoyal dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, meaning the Justice Department can refile it. The department declined to comment Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department has now filed lawsuits against 24 states and the District of Columbia seeking voter information as part of its effort to collect detailed voting data, including dates of birth and driver’s license and Social Security numbers. A federal judge in California rejected the lawsuit against that state on privacy grounds, while a judge in Oregon has suggested he may dismiss the case there.\n\nThe Trump administration characterizes the lawsuits as an effort to ensure election security, and the Justice Department says the states are violating federal law by refusing to provide voter lists and information.\n\nRaffensperger has been the rare Republican to decline the demand, saying Georgia law prohibits the release of voters' confidential personal unless certain qualifications are met. Raffensperger argues the federal government hasn't met those conditions. He says he shared the public part of the voter roll and information about how Georgia removes ineligible or outdated registrations in December.\n\n“I will always follow the law and follow the Constitution,” Raffensperger said in a statement Friday. “I won't violate the oath I took to stand up for the people of this state, regardless of who or what compels me to do otherwise.”\n\nThe refusal to hand over the records has become an issue in Raffensperger's 2026 run for governor. Raffensperger in January 2021 famously refused a demand from President Donald Trump in a phone call to “find” enough votes to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s win in Georgia's 2020 presidential election. Many Trump-loving Republicans still hold a grudge against Raffensperger.\n\nThe issue flared just Thursday in a hearing by a state Senate committee where multiple Republican state senators slammed Raffensperger for failing to comply, saying he legally could do so. The committee voted along party lines to advance a resolution calling on Raffensperger to hand over the data and calling it the “latest example of a pattern of behavior by the secretary and his office to refuse oversight of his administration of Georgia’s elections.”\n\nState Sen. Randy Robertson, a Republican from Cataula who filed the resolution, said the dismissal is “frustrating” because even if the Justice Department refiles the lawsuit, the problem will take longer to resolve.\n\n“As public officials we all should participate in any investigation done by a law enforcement agency,” Robertson told The Associated Press Friday.\n\nRobertson is one of many Republican lawmakers backing Lt. Gov. Burt Jones over Raffensperger for the GOP governor nomination. Jones, who already has Trump's endorsement for governor, was one of 16 state Republicans who signed a certificate that Trump had won Georgia and declaring themselves the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has completely misunderstood what global warming means in a bonkers post on social media.\n\nThe U.S. is facing a potentially historically cold period, with the eastern two-thirds of the country expected to experience sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall, which could cause major disruption. For the president, that is proof enough that “global warming” is a hoax.\n\n“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States,” he said on Truth Social. “Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”\n\nIt is not entirely clear who he meant by “Environmental Insurrectionists.”\n\nThe world’s most powerful man has repeatedly shown he is apprehensive about the existence of climate change, championing fossil fuel policies and peddling conspiracy theories, despite an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that it poses a real and imminent threat.\n\nIt has long been public knowledge that the now-relegated term global warming does not mean that cold temperatures will not occur, but rather that the average temperature inside the Earth’s atmosphere will be higher, disrupting delicate environmental balances.\n\nThe term is now instead regarded as merely a part of the wider phenomenon of climate change.\n\nCold landmasses and warm waters in the Arctic are stretching the polar vortex, dragging cold air further south. When that cold air meets warm, moist southern air, it could cause heavy snow, PBS reports.\n\nOn its website, the American Red Cross said, “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur,” the Guardian reports.\n\nThe BBC reports that “cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York,” could be blanketed with snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the weather could “pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin.”\n\nThe storm is expected to reach as far west as New Mexico, with around 230 million people staring down the barrel of 20-degree temperatures as state governors declare emergencies across the country.\n\nTrump’s disregard for the environment is well-documented. On his first day back in the Oval Office last year, he gave an executive order called “Putting people over fish,” where he disregarded the endangered delta smelt as “an essentially worthless fish,” and demanded water from their habitat be taken to fight fires hundreds of miles away.\n\nHe has also waged a long-running war on wind turbines, claiming “windmills” are making whales crazy and killing bald eagles, a point he illustrated on social media by posting a picture of a dead falcon in Israel.\n\nIn September, he gave a speech to the United Nations, where he said climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”\n\nDuring the same speech, he said, “I have a little standing order in the White House,” he said. “Never use the word ‘coal’. Only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal’. Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”",

    "fullText": "For only so long can economic reality be denied in uncertain times until it becomes too obvious to continue postponing, especially when the consequences affect millions of consumers. If it feels like something fundamental has shifted at Amazon, that's because it has.\n\nFor more than three decades, Amazon has been a dependable source of fast delivery and affordable prices. But recently, a key aspect of its business has come under pressure from forces beyond its control.\n\nIn July 2025, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy downplayed concerns about tariffs during an earnings call, calling media reports about their impact on retail prices and consumption \"wrong and misreported,\" stating that it was too early to draw conclusions.\n\n\"We haven't yet seen diminishing demand, nor price is meaningfully appreciating,\" said Jassy. \"We also have such diversity of sellers in our marketplace, over 2 million sellers in total, with different strategies of whether to pass on higher cost to consumers, the customers are advantaged shopping at Amazon because they're more likely to find lower prices on the items they care about.\"\n\nHowever, six months later, Jassy's tone has shifted. Now, he is warning consumers of an unfortunate reality.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Jassy acknowledged that while consumers remain resilient and continue spending, their behavior has changed. Shoppers are actively seeking bargains, leading to slower sales of higher-priced discretionary items.\n\nAt the same time, consumers are buying more everyday essentials thanks to Amazon's continued investments in faster delivery. However, these products are necessary goods that people will keep buying even if prices rise.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of tariffs, Amazon did extensive pre-buying in early 2025, allowing it to hold prices steady longer than many competitors. With its global network of warehouses and distribution centers, the company was able to import and store goods in bulk ahead of anticipated cost increases.\n\nBut that extra supply ran out in the fall.\n\nWhile some of its third-party sellers have chosen to absorb the higher costs to maintain market share, others are passing them on to consumers, resulting in some price hikes.\n\n\"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items,\" he said. \"Some sellers are deciding that they’re passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between.\"\n\nJassy blamed U.S. tariffs as a primary driver of the price increases, as these have raised the cost of imported goods.",

    "description": "Denmark is retiring the iconic F-16 fighter jet fleet and is replacing it with a new high-tech jet. Here's everything you need to know.",
    "fullText": "After 46 years of service to the Royal Danish Air Force, Denmark has retired its fleet of F-16 fighter planes as of January 18, 2026. Denmark has used this versatile, but now obsolete, fighter plane since 1980, having bought a total of 77 of these aircraft. A farewell ceremony was held at Skrydstrup Air Base's Hangar 3, where four F-16s landed after performing one final flight over Danish soil. Pilots, technicians, and others who had worked with the F-16s greeted the invited guests, showing off these planes one last time.\n\nThe history of the F-16 starts in the early 1970s, when a group of General Dynamics aerospace analysts and engineers designed what would become the F-16. Dissatisfied with the trend of making fighter planes more difficult to maneuver and heavier than their predecessors, this group, known as the Lightweight Fighter Mafia, created something completely different.\n\nDenmark is replacing the last of its F-16 aircraft with the F-35A Lightning II fighter jet, which has been used by the Danes since the first ones arrived there in 2023. On the first of April 2025, Denmark's F-35s took over from its F-16s in NATO's Quick Reaction Alert mission. In total, the Danish Defense Ministry has bought a total of 43 F-35s, 27 of them ordered in 2016 plus 16 additional planes in 2025. The F-35A is a single-seat aircraft powered by a Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 engine with 40,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nDenmark's switch to a full fleet of F-35A Lightning IIs makes the Royal Danish Air Force the third air force in the world, after Norway in 2022 and the Netherlands in 2024, to consist entirely of fifth-generation fighter planes, all of them being F-35As. They have all replaced their obsolete fleets of F-16s with these cutting-edge, multirole fighters. The replacement process took as long as it did due to major delays in producing the F-35 for the various forces around the world.\n\nThe F-35, which comes in many variants with distinct features, is made in three different versions for various use cases. The F-35A, the version which the U.S. Air Force and Denmark uses, is designed for conventional takeoff and landing. The F-35B, made for the U.S. Marine Corps, has a short takeoff and vertical landing capability. The F-35C, produced for the U.S. Navy, is adapted for launching from and landing on the Navy's aircraft carriers.\n\nDenmark's fleet of F-16 fighter jets are going to two different locations. Even though these F-16s are quite old, with the first batch delivered in 1980, the Danes have not only maintained them very well, they have also modernized them over the years. These actions have helped to make these planes more suitable for sale than scrapping.\n\nOne group of F-16s will be donated to Ukraine, as part of the 19 planes Denmark agreed to donate to the Ukrainian Air Force in 2023. The first of the Danish F-16s, one of the many kinds of fighter jets Ukraine has, reached Ukraine in August 2024. Denmark has also pledged to support the costs associated with training of Ukrainian pilots in Denmark, as well as those required for the maintenance and operations of these planes after they reach Ukraine. The Ukrainian Air Force uses their F-16s primarily to defend the country against Russian drones and missiles, as well as for dropping precision-guided bombs to provide close air support.\n\nA total of 24 of Denmark's F-16s will be sold to Argentina, which has not had any supersonic fighters in its arsenal since the country retired its French Mirages back in 2015. The U.S. Government was heavily involved in this deal due to its export regulations. The Argentinian F-16 package also includes training, parts, and simulators, to ensure proper maintenance and operation of the Argentine Air Force's 'new' F-16s. The first six planes were delivered in December, with additional batches each year through 2028.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "A dad fought to keep his daughter \"calm\" as the helicopter they were riding on plunged nearly 500 feet to the ground in Wasatch County, Utah, earlier this week\n\nAll four people on board survived, but the young woman, Oaklee Toone, suffered a head injury\n\n\"It really is my worst nightmare,\" Toone's sister Baylee Demars said of learning about the crash\n\nA father comforted his daughter as the helicopter they were riding in plummeted almost 500 feet to the ground in Utah over the weekend, the family says.\n\nAll four people onboard survived, but the young woman was airlifted in critical condition.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it,” Baylee Demars told NBC affiliate KSL of learning that her dad, Kory Toone, and sister, Oaklee Toone, had been in a chopper crash on Sunday, Jan. 18.\n\n“It really is my worst nightmare,” Demars said.\n\nThat Sunday afternoon, around 3:10 p.m. local time, a Bell 206L carrying four people crashed near a highway in Wasatch County, the Federal Aviation Administration confirms to PEOPLE.\n\nLocal officials received a report of the crash and were able to locate the helicopter 100 yards off State Road 35, the Wasatch County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.\n\n“One individual sustained critical injury and was transported by AirMed to a hospital for treatment of a head injury,” authorities said. “The remaining occupants were evaluated at the scene.”\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is leading an ongoing investigation. A spokesperson for the agency says that the on-scene phase of the investigation is complete and a preliminary report is expected by next month.\n\nA final report is expected within one to two years.\n\nThe crash landing brought an abrupt end to a fun outing for the Toones and their close friends — the pilot and his wife – KSL reported.\n\nKory had started recording the flight on his cell phone and the video captured both him and Oaklee smiling.\n\nBut as the helicopter later began to spin out of the pilot’s control, careening to the ground, the dad dropped his phone, according to KSL.\n\nThe recording continued, and Demars was later able to listen to the audio that was captured before the helicopter crashed near Wolf Creek Campground.\n\n“Something you got to know about my dad is he’s a rock,” Demars told KSL. “Hearing him coach my sister through that and keep her calm, they both think they’re about to die, and he’s keeping her calm.”\n\nAt the end of the recording, Demars said she could hear Oaklee call out to their dad, “I’m alive. I’m alive. Dad, are you alive?”\n\n“He responded back and that was music to my ears,” Demars told the outlet. “I was just so happy to hear that they could talk.”\n\nNearby snowmobilers, one of whom was a nurse, witnessed the aircraft's descent and assisted the passengers until first responders arrived.\n\nKory is now healing from serious chest injuries, and his daughter hit her head, KSL reported.\n\nDemars credited the pilot for helping save everyone on board.\n\nAll four people are now out of the hospital, which she said is a “miracle,” KSL reported. Even so, her sister has a long recovery ahead of her, prompting Demars to launch a GoFundMe.\n\n“She works tirelessly to provide for herself and this head injury will prevent her from income for some time,” Demars wrote with the fundraiser. “The upcoming cost of her AirMed and medical bills are certainly stressful for her.”\n\nAs the family heals, they’re grateful they have more time together.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“The thing you experience when you think you’re about to die is you’re not thinking about your possessions,” Demars told KSL. “You’re thinking about people, your family, your friends, your loved ones.”\n\nShe added, “My dad expressed that that was what was running through his mind.\"",

    "fullText": "This Florida man was taking his puppy out for a late-night bathroom break when he noticed a nearly eight-foot alligator making use of his pool.\n\nFox Weather reported on a video taken by Rob Emhoff that showcased a gator swimming around the family pool.\n\nThankfully, with a quick call to the state's wildlife control office, a professional alligator trapper was sent to the scene to safely remove the animal from the property.\n\nEmhoff was shocked, saying, \"I would never believe this if someone told me.\"\n\nIn the video, the trapper catches the gator with a snare, tapes its mouth shut, and drags it out of the pool.\n\nAlligators have an incredibly powerful bite but struggle to open their mouths with nearly the same strength, so wrapping tape thoroughly around the snout keeps their teeth out of commission.\n\nThrough careful, humane removal, the alligator was taken off the homeowners' property without any problems other than interrupted sleep.\n\nHowever, instances such as this one are becoming more common as habitat loss increases across the globe.\n\nThe family made the right choice to call in someone who knew exactly how to take the alligator out of their pool without hurting it. In the video, the gator seemed placid until it rolled viciously as it was removed from the pool.\n\nWhen people try to interfere with wildlife without professional involvement, they or the animal can be harmed. If that happens, the creature may have to be euthanized.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAs wildlife continue to lose places to live, they seek refuge in human-dominated spaces. This can lead to not-so-pleasant encounters between people and animals that can end badly for both parties.\n\nAnother Floridian wasn't so lucky with her own alligator encounter, pulling her puppy from harm's way and taking a few bites to the arm in the process. The gator, which had been occupying a creek near the woman's home, was put down.\n\nAs animals are forced to inhabit locations where humans have encroached on once pristine land, human-wildlife interactions become more of an issue.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that approaching or handling wild animals, especially when those animals are in unfamiliar territories, puts everyone involved at risk.\n\nThus, knowing who to call is a key component to keeping humans and animals safe. It is always best to contact authorities, as they know the proper procedures to follow to keep everyone protected.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",
