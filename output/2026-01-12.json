    "fullText": "Mikel Merino spoke of his delight for Arsenal team-mates Kai Havertz and Gabriel Martinelli after Arsenal’s 4-1 win over Portsmouth in the FA Cup.\n\nMartinelli scored a hat-trick to send his side through to the fourth round, after what had been a difficult week for the Brazilian having been criticised for trying to push Liverpool Conor Bradley off of the pitch while he was down injured.\n\nBut Merino praised the 24-year-old for his response to the noise around him.\n\n“We are really happy for him,” he said. “He’s a great guy. Everyone that knows him knows he’s a really, really kind kid.\n\n“He’s always smiling. He’s always kind with everyone. Obviously, you can see that today he came here with the best attitude. Knowing he’s a great professional as well, it doesn’t matter the atmosphere around him. He’s always focused on the team, on doing the best thing possible.\n\n“We are very pleased that he’s performing this well.”\n\nOn the incident against Liverpool, Merino added: “Yeah, obviously sometimes when you’re on the pitch, you don’t have all the clues, you don’t have all the information and you can react in a certain way.\n\n“But obviously, everyone knows how good of a kid he is. He never pretends to or tries to make someone feel bad. It was just a small mistake and he said sorry and the matter ends there.”\n\nMerino also says he is “buzzing” for Kai Havertz, who made his first Arsenal appearance since August against Portsmouth having been sidelined through injury.\n\n“Amazing, amazing,” Merino said.\n\n“We’re all buzzing for him to come back after a big, big injury. To have him around is so good for everyone, for the atmosphere in the training ground, for the support that he gives us as well in the training ground, having him around every training session.\n\n“And now having him on the pitch is one more asset, one more tool for the coach. Yes, really happy for him.”",

    "fullText": "Xabi Alonso explains Vinicius Junior’s substitution as Real Madrid fell to Barcelona in the Super Cup final.\n\nXabi Alonso has explained why he took off Vinicius Junior during Real Madrid’s Spanish Super Cup final defeat to Barcelona on Sunday.\n\nVinicius’s goal ended a 16-game drought, but Real Madrid still lost 3–2 as Barcelona retained the trophy. Alonso said the decision to substitute him was more about caution and praised the forward’s impact on the game.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Xabi Alonso confirmed that Vinicius Jr. had asked to come off in the closing stages.\n\nAlonso also urged his team to move past the defeat quickly and refocus on the season ahead, while also dismissing the Supercopa as the least of their priorities.\n\n“Vinicius was very good until the final stages. He asked to come off because of fatigue. There was a lot of humidity. He was a constant threat, the goal was spectacular and he caused a lot of problems down his side.\n\n“We have to move on as soon as possible. It’s the least important of the competitions we play. We have to look forward, try to get players back from injury, get our morale back and keep going.”\n\nReal Madrid were without Eder Militao and Antonio Rudiger, while Kylian Mbappe only featured as a late substitute after recovering from a knee injury. Alonso said the absence of key players affected the team’s balance and stability during the match.\n\nThe defeat marked Real Madrid’s third consecutive loss to Barcelona in a final. Xabi Alonso admitted that while losing to their biggest rivals is always difficult, the focus must remain on the upcoming fixtures.\n\n“It’s never nice to lose a final against a rival. We had our moments, but small details made the difference.”\n\nThibaut Courtois also echoed his manager’s frustration, saying Madrid “deserved to win” in the second half but were undone by missed chances.\n\nThe goalkeeper added that the team will use the setback as motivation to respond in domestic and European competitions.\n\nWith La Liga and Champions League fixtures on the horizon, Alonso said he expects a strong reaction from his players as Madrid look to recover from their latest setback and push for major titles later in the season.",

    "fullText": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow the various narrative paths.\n\n“Maybe I called it wrong, but it’s official.” — Tom Connolly, HoF Umpire.\n\nHappy birthday to Bill Madlock*,  it’s drafty in here, and other stories for the discerning reader,\n\n1887 – The New York Metropolitans (American Association) buy third baseman Dude Esterbrook from the New York Giants (NL). Although the Mets are no longer owned by the Giants’ management, the Giants still seem to get the best of every deal between the two clubs. (2)\n\n1900 – Baltimore Orioles manager John McGraw threatens that if the National League drops the Orioles, which are controlled by the owners of the Brooklyn Superbas, he will form an American League team. Two weeks later the NL Circuit Committee recommends buying out Baltimore, Washington, Cleveland, and Louisville and going to an eight-team league. McGraw then organizes a Baltimore club in the AL, which is still a minor league circuit at this point, albeit one with bigger ambitions. (2)\n\n1920 – A plan developed by Charles Ebbets many years ago is finally adopted: the annual drafting of players from the minor leagues will be done in inverse order of the final standings. (1,2)\n\n1921 – Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis takes over his new role as Commissioner of baseball. Landis, who is given wide-ranging powers, replaces the three-man National Commission that had been running the game for nearly two decades. (2)\n\n1950 – The New York Yankees sell their Newark Bears franchise to the Chicago Cubs, who will move the team to Springfield, Massachusetts. The once-proud Bears, owned by the Yankees since 1932, finished last in the International League in 1949. (2)\n\n1961 – Charlie Grimm and Verlon Walker are named to the Chicago Cubs College of Coaches. Using this system, a different coach will manage the team each month during the season, and members of the group will move between the major league team and its minor league affiliates. (2)\n\n1982 – In the January draft, the Blue Jays use the #1 pick on OF Kash Beauchamp and the Cubs follow by taking C Troy Afenir. But the Twins, picking third, strike gold when they take OF Kirby Puckett. Meanwhile, the Reds choose P Randy Myers in the first round while the Mets select OF Kal Daniels in the third round. The 433rd pick overall is OF John Cangelosi, taken by the White Sox. (2)\n\n2018 – The Blue Jays sign 3B Josh Donaldson to one-year deal worth $23 million. It is the largest salary ever given to a player eligible for salary arbitration, besting the $21.6 million given to Bryce Harper by the Nationals last May. Donaldson’s is not the only record-setting deal signed today: the Cubs offer 3B Kris Bryant $10.85 million, the most ever for a player eligible for arbitration for the first time. (2)\n\nCubs Birthdays: George Browne, Roy Easterwood, Phil Mudrock, Paul Reuschel, Bill Madlock*,\n\n475 – Basiliscus becomes Byzantine Emperor, with a coronation ceremony in the Hebdomon palace in Constantinople.\n\n1554 – Bayinnaung is crowned King of Burma, assembles the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia.\n\n1812 – First cargo arrives in New Orleans by steamboat from Natchez.\n\n1906 – First time Dow Jones Industrial Average closes above 100 (100.26).\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nSome of these items spread from site to site without being fact-checked, and that is why we ask for verifiable sources, in order to help correct the record.",

    "fullText": "We’re not all that far off now from spring training. Just one month remains until pitchers and catchers report to camp. But this MLB offseason feels anything but complete.\n\nPlenty of top-tier free agents have yet to sign anywhere. Of MLB Trade Rumors’ top 10 ranked FAs, half of them remain on the market: Kyle Tucker (#1), Bo Bichette (#2), Framber Valdez (#6), Cody Bellinger (#8), and Ranger Suárez (#10). And #5 on that list, Alex Bregman, just joined the Cubs two days ago.\n\nThere’s a lot of great talent still available for whichever teams are willing to pay for it. Orioles fans, of course, are hoping that Baltimore is one of those teams. Valdez or Suárez, the two pitchers on that list, are the most sensible fits for the Birds. But hey, why stop there? I’ve been beating the Kyle Tucker drum this offseason and I’m not going to stop now, even though the O’s acquired Taylor Ward earlier this winter. I say if you have the financial wherewithal to add a premium free agent — which the Orioles do, if the Pete Alonso signing is any indication — then you might as well be in discussions with all the top guys, even if they’re not an obvious fit on the roster. Sign Tucker to play right field, and you could have Dylan Beavers back up at all three outfield positions. I’m not particularly concerned about what would happen to Tyler O’Neill in that scenario.\n\nHeck, sign Bo Bichette to play second base. You could move Jackson Holliday to, I don’t know, center field? Or go ahead and swipe Cody Bellinger out from under the Yankees’ noses. He’s not the defensive center fielder he once was, but I’d probably trust him more than Colton Cowser out there, and he’s certainly a better hitter.\n\nMaybe I’m only being half-serious with these suggestions. The O’s don’t have unlimited cash and would probably prefer to stick to the more realistic options. But can anyone say they’d truly be upset if the O’s came out of nowhere and landed someone like Tucker, Bichette, or Bellinger, in addition to one of the pitchers? What an offseason that would be.\n\nSo go ahead, Orioles. You’ve got a month left to do something truly awesome. Let’s have some fun, shall we?\n\nCan Bradfield be Orioles’ Opening Day centerfielder? | MAILBAG – BaltimoreBaseball.com\n\nThis mailbag question comes from someone who did not follow Bradfield’s 2025 season, I suppose. Rich Dubroff rightly responds that there’s no chance of it happening.\n\nAs solid offseason winds down, is there pressure on O’s to add one more starter? – Steve Melewski\n\nDepends what you mean by “pressure.” I don’t think Elias will be fired or anything if he doesn’t add another starter. But I hope he’s prepared for Orioles fans to angrily voice their displeasure on the internet. Take that, Mike!\n\nThis, that and the other – School of Roch\n\nGunnar Henderson is hyped about the World Baseball Classic. You and me both, Gunnar.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! Six former Orioles were born on this day, including (Na Na Na-Na-Na) Kim! Hyun! Soo!, who turns 38. After his brief MLB stint with the Birds from 2016-17, Kim is still going strong in the Korea Baseball Organization, spending the past eight years with the LG Twins. Other ex-O’s celebrating Jan. 12 birthdays are right-handers Chris Ray (44) and Luis Ayala (48), infielders Tim Hulett (66) and Juan Bonilla (70), and lefty Paul Gilliford (81).\n\nOn this date in 2007, the Orioles traded righty Rodrigo López to the Rockies for two prospects. López had been a solid starter for the O’s for five seasons, averaging more than 180 innings per year and thrice serving as the Opening Day starter. He was the AL Rookie of the Year runner-up in 2002. In his last season with the Birds, though, López led the league in both losses (18) and earned runs allowed (124).",

Heading into the season, he was expected to be one of the top weapons for quarterback Jordan Love, but he was behind Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, Dontayvion Wicks, and even Bo Melton at times.\n\nGolden should've at least been the fourth receiver in the offense, if not in a bigger role, as evidenced by his performance against Chicago.\n\nThe 22-year-old wideout hauled in four receptions for 84 yards and a touchdown. Golden's explosiveness and ability to make clutch catches were pivotal for the Packers' offense.\n\nWhile they didn't come away with the win, Golden's impact was felt and proves that the Packers should've had him on the field earlier in the season.\n\nIn 14 games in the regular season, Golden was targeted 44 times, catching 29 passes for 361 yards, and did not find the endzone.\n\nGolden showcased in the playoffs why the Packers drafted him and what he is capable of doing in an expanded role. With his emergence, it makes a free agency decision that much easier.\n\nWide receiver Romeo Doubs is entering free agency, and with a lot of Green Bay's cap space being tied up to Jordan Love and Micah Parsons, every contract decision is pivotal.\n\nDoubs is a quality receiver, as he had 55 receptions for 724 yards and six touchdowns in the 2025 season. He was also crucial in the playoff matchup, as he had eight receptions for 124 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe Packers would love to keep Doubs, but there are bigger needs, such as cornerback, the defensive line, and offensive line depth.\n\nGreen Bay has Watson, Golden, Reed, Wicks, and Savion Williams under contract for the 2026 season, giving them a solid receiver room without Doubs.\n\nUnless the Packers are able to work out a cheap contract with Doubs, they should let him go, allow Golden to take on a bigger role, and upgrade the roster elsewhere for the 2026 season.",

    "description": "The New York Yankees are apparently pursuing Kyle Tucker, but they just received some bad news in that department.",
    "fullText": "The New York Yankees have reportedly moved away from Cody Bellinger and have pivoted to other options in MLB free agency. One of those options? Kyle Tucker.\n\nTucker is the jewel of this year's free-agent class and was viewed as a potential fit for the Yankees heading into the winter, but it didn't appear that New York had much interest in the four-time All-Star.\n\nHowever, recent events may have changed things for the Bronx Bombers, as Bellinger seems to be asking for $36-37 million annually, a rather steep price for a merely good — not great — 30-year-old player with an injury history.\n\nAs a result, the Yankees have evidently decided to turn their attention to Tucker, who was said to be seeking a $400 million contract at the outset of he offseason, but may have reduced his demands as a result of a slow market.\n\nBut unfortunately, it does not appear that New York is one of the favorites to sign him.\n\nFormer MLB general manager Jim Duquette has revealed that the Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets are the three teams most connected to Tucker and have all met with the outfielder either in person or via video call.\n\nDuquette wondered if any one of those three ballclubs would \"increase\" their offers, indicating that each of those teams have already made overtures to Tucker.\n\nSo, where do the Yankees fit in all of this? Have they made Tucker an offer? Are they laying in the weeds? Are they really not that interested in the former Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs star?\n\nIt's also entirely possible that Alex Bregman's recent five-year, $175 million contract with the Cubs has rejuvenated Tucker's market and, therefore, his asking price, which may have caused the Yanks to bow out of the process.\n\nNew York has not made a single notable addition this winter. The Yankees are supposedly trying to make a trade for a starting pitcher, but things appear to be moving at a snail's pace on that front.\n\nAs far as signing big-name free agents? Outside of Bellinger, New York has not seemed serious about anyone. It was also linked to Bo Bichette, but it seems hard to imagine the Yanks meeting his asking price, especially considering how bad he is defensively.\n\nIf the Yankees really want Tucker, they better jump in now, because all three of the teams mentioned have deep pockets and are clearly not afraid to spend.",

He has three seasons of eligibility remaining.\n\nWoods is another upside-based swing from Blake Baker and his defensive staff. He wasn’t particularly productive this season, recording five pressures, two sacks, five tackles and two run stops in 2025, per Pro Football Focus. Although some list Woods as an edge rusher, he didn’t line up there often, instead playing primarily as a three-technique.\n\nWoods is a key depth addition, however. LSU lost several defensive linemen to the transfer portal this offseason, and although they’ve done a high-quality job replacing them so far, it never hurts to continue fortifying the position. Woods makes five defensive line signees from the portal for LSU, including former Tennessee edge rusher Jordan Ross, former Clemson defensive lineman Stephiylan Green, former Auburn defensive lineman Malik Blocton, and former South Carolina edge rusher Jaylen Brown.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how snaps are distributed at the position next season, as the Tigers also signed the No. 1- and No. 2-ranked defensive linemen in the Class of 2026, Richard Anderson and Lamar Brown.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football lands transfer portal defensive lineman from Sun Belt",

While five of his eleven interceptions came between the numbers, four were thrown along the left boundary, mainly due to the lack of size at wide receiver against average-sized defensive backs.\n\nMario Craver is one of the fastest players in college football, but is a mere 5'9\", and should have his best season yet in the Z or slot receiver role with Hortmon on the field, as the coverage will now have to focus on the Alabama transfer, especially if he finds early success in SEC play.\n\nBarring any changes, including Auburn transfer WR Malcolm Simmon's impending decision and Colorado transfer receiver Dre'Lon Miller's visit to College Station this weekend, Isaiah Hortmon looks like the final piece of the puzzle for Texas A&M's 2026 wide receiver corps.\n\nIf the 2025 Texas A&M WR group had one weakness, it was their lack of a big-bodied WRs who can be an outside man beater and grab 50-50 balls.

    "description": "Wisconsin found success with 'small ball' lineup combinations during crucial stretches of the Badgers' upset win over No. 1 Michigan.",
    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. – Greg Gard rattled off three numbers after a recent practice as he looked ahead to the Wisconsin Badgers’ challenge against No. 1 Michigan that loomed a few days away.\n\n“7-4, 6-10, 6-9,” Gard told reporters. “That’s your three, four, five.”\n\nThose were roughly – give or take an inch – the heights of Michigan starters Aday Mara, Yaxel Lendeborg and Morez Johnson Jr.\n\nWisconsin’s answer to that trio consisted of some different numbers. The Badgers started with players who were 7-0, 6-10 and 6-6, and they used even smaller groupings at various points in the game, including 7-0, 6-5, 6-5.\n\nEither way, they were winning numbers as Wisconsin went small at times against Michigan – “the biggest team we’ve played across the board,” John Blackwell said – and walked away with a big 91-88 upset along with its first road win and first Quad 1 win of the season.\n\n“The small lineup really didn’t hurt us that much,” Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said after the game. “We’re really active, we really fly around when we’re small, and we cover for each other.”\n\nWisconsin played about nine minutes with four guards and one forward on the floor. That included a four-plus-minute stretch during the first half in which Wisconsin had a 16-10 scoring advantage. Overall, UW outscored Michigan, 24-18, when it had four guards on the floor.\n\nBraeden Carrington was a key part of that success, amassing a team-high nine rebounds while essentially serving as UW’s guy at the No. 4 spot in the four-guard lineup. Gard thought Carrington’s “experience showed” in the 91-88 win as a “vet that’s been in these types of games.”\n\n“He’s a terrific rebounder for his size, and he’s got competitive toughness to him that I think has blossomed and grown in the last few weeks,” Gard said of the 6-foot-5 guard who previously played at Minnesota and Tulsa. “It’s gotten better.”\n\nWisconsin’s smaller lineup was somewhat of a necessity given the Badgers’ lack of depth in the frontcourt. Portland transfer Austin Rapp, who had been averaging 23.3 minutes per game, missed his second consecutive game with an injury.\n\nAside from starters Nolan Winter and Aleksas Bieliauskas, freshman seven-footer Will Garlock was the only other available player who is taller than 6-foot-6 for the Michigan game. Garlock has played no more than nine minutes in any of the Badgers’ games against high-major foes this season.\n\n“This is deep water for Will as a freshman,” Gard said of the former three-star recruit from Middleton. “He was playing DeForest High School a year ago. So this is a little different. So he’s figuring some things out.”\n\nWinter played 36 minutes, Bieliauskas played 31 minutes and Garlock played four minutes against Michigan.\n\n“We were able to rotate them to some degree to try to keep them both fresh,” Gard said of Winter and Bieliauskas. “Or fresher.”\n\nWinter and Bieliauskas both delivered amid their heavy workloads. Bieliauskas had a career-high 17 points and made four consecutive 3-pointers that served as a turning point in the win. Winter had nine points on 3-of-4 shooting from 3-point range along with three rebounds and two assists.\n\n“When you have bigs that are skilled and can pass and dribble and shoot, it puts a lot of pressure on a defense, and we were able to use some of that to our advantage,” Gard said.\n\nIt is unclear whether Rapp will be available to play – and consequently whether the Badgers will have a fourth frontcourt option – on Jan. 13 against Minnesota.\n\n“He did some workouts here today,” Gard said after the team’s Jan. 11 practice in Madison. “We didn’t do a lot of live stuff or body-on-body stuff. So he’s working with the trainer, working with our assistants in terms of repping and getting some things back in. So we’ll see how he responds, and it’ll obviously be the medical staff’s call of what he will do.”\n\nBut even if Rapp was available to take some of the workload as well, the Badgers may have still gone with the smaller lineup at times.\n\n“It’s something we have talked about, even prior to Rapp’s injury,” Gard said. “We felt small ball was a thing we could take advantage of, and obviously our guys have done a good job of filling into those roles.”\n\nBut Wisconsin’s upset also showed that “you can make a lot of good things happen when you play hard.” That certainly was not exclusive to the Badgers’ nine minutes of playing with a smaller lineup either.\n\n“The biggest common denominator was everybody that stepped on the floor had a lot of fight to them,” Gard said moments after the Badgers’ big upset. “That was the thing that – regardless of how many minutes, how many points – everybody came ready to compete.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin Badgers find success going small vs big Michigan frontcourt",

    "description": "Manchester United are said to have identified three main candidates to take interim charge of the team.",
    "fullText": "Man United interim manager options: Best candidates for temporary role as Ruben Amorim replacement originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nManchester United look set to place an interim manager in charge of the first team for the third time in just over five years, having first done so with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2018 and then Ralf Rangnick in 2021.\n\nRuben Amorim was dramatically sacked on January 5 after falling out with club bosses and failing to demonstrate sufficient progress with the team, leaving United needing to find a seventh permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013.\n\nHowever, just as they did when Jose Mourinho and then Ole Gunnar Solskjaer were dismissed, the Red Devils appear set to hire an interim boss to oversee matters until the end of the season, at which point a full-time replacement for Amorim will be brought in.\n\nThere are three clear candidates for the position, all of whom have strong ties to the club: Solskjaer, Darren Fletcher, and Michael Carrick.\n\nThe Sporting News assesses which of the three represents the best short-term option.\n\nMORE:Amorim's record compared to post-Ferguson managers | Why Amorim lost his job\n\nBelow are the current best options for United as they look for someone to take charge of the first team for the remainder of 2025/26.\n\nWidespread reports in England on January 5 made it clear that Solskjaer was keen on the idea of returning to United for another crack at the manager job.\n\nThis time, he would almost certainly be brought on for an interim role only and then leave at the end of the season, regardless of the team's results. Solskjaer got the permanent job in 2019 after a brilliant spell as temporary boss, but he was unable to build on that early promise, and most supporters were desperate for a change by the time he was sacked in November 2021. United's powerbrokers won't want to repeat that mistake.\n\nHe would be a popular choice as interim manager given that positive previous spell, and having left Besiktas in August, his appointment would not accrue any compensation costs. However, at this stage, it appears he is behind Carrick in the running.\n\nLikelihood: 5/10\nSuitability: 6/10\n\nFletcher took charge of the team for the league game at Burnley and the FA Cup match at home to Brighton & Hove Albion, which effectively gave him an audition for the interim role. The fact those matches ended in a 2-2 draw and 2-1 defeat may well have counted against him.\n\nLike Solskjaer and Carrick, Fletcher enjoyed a hugely successful playing career at United and has been part of their coaching set-up since 2020, initially working with the youth sides before taking on a role as technical director.\n\nFletcher is considered a knowledgeable and astute coach and someone with a degree of gravitas at the club, but his lack of experience in management at senior level means he was always somewhat up against it to prove he is the right man to oversee matters until the end of the season.\n\nLikelihood: 4/10\nSuitability: 4/10\n\nCarrick joined United's coaching staff under Mourinho after retiring at the end of a glittering playing career in 2018. He was kept on by Solskjaer, and, when the Norwegian was dismissed, Carrick took temporary charge of the team, beating Villarreal and Arsenal before leaving the club once Ralf Rangnick came on board.\n\nThe ex-midfielder is another who knows Old Trafford well and has experienced two very different styles of management. His time at Middlesbrough was a mixed bag. He got them very close to promotion, as well as the semifinals of the Carabao Cup, but things went backwards in his second season. Nevertheless, the former England international showed plenty of signs of being a promising tactician.\n\nLike Solskjaer, Carrick is unattached and would not require a compensation payment. He has a good chance of getting the role and would appear to have edged ahead in the race — perhaps because he current leadership team at United do not want to be seen to be rehashing old ideas by going back to Solskjaer, or maybe because he has impressed them the most during talks.\n\nLikelihood: 7/10\nSuitability: 6/10\n\nOn face value, United going for another stop-gap solution as manager would seem strange. There is around half of the season left to play, and they are firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification. The campaign is far from a write-off, even considering their eliminations from the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.\n\nHowever, there are justifiable reasons why they might wait before appointing their next permanent manager.\n\nFor one thing, parachuting Amorim into the job just didn't pay off. The Portuguese wanted to wait until the end of 2024/25 before taking over as Erik ten Hag's successor, but he was told it was \"now or never\" and chose to take the plunge. It's fair to say this did not work out too well for anyone concerned.\n\nMORE:Ruben Amorim timeline at Man United, from Rashford clash to Leeds rant\n\nIt is also worth remembering that, although his overall time in charge was no great success, Solskjaer was a very good temporary boss when hired for that role in December 2018. After the toxicity of Mourinho's final months in charge, Solskjaer restored dressing-room morale, reconnected a disenchanted fan base, and got the players to enjoy playing more expressive, attacking football again. They won 14 of their first 17 games under the Norwegian, including a famous 3-1 Champions League victory at Paris Saint-Germain that resulted in an ill-advised clamour for United to hire him permanently. Their form only really began to tail off once talk of him getting the full-time job took hold.\n\nGoing for another temporary boss would give United the chance to pursue their objectives for the remainder of this season — specifically, Champions League qualification — while taking care to identify the best long-term candidate and then appointing that person in the summer, when far more managers will be more readily available as contracts with club sides and World Cup teams come to an end.",

    "fullText": "Darren Fletcher’s interim stint at Man Utd has not seen much progress, and it looks like he has come to the same conclusion about the club that Ruben Amorim once did.\n\nWhile there were a few positives to take from the draw with Burnley, United’s defence struggled badly in their 2-1 defeat to Brighton.\n\nFletcher saw his team fall behind by two goals before Benjamin Sesko scored a late goal, which was no more than a consolation.\n\nAfter the match, Fletcher reached a harsh verdict on this United squad, echoing concerns that fans had already heard during Amorim’s tenure.\n\nAmorim was known for his honesty during his time at Old Trafford, and while he had his shortcomings, fans generally appreciated his willingness to call things as he saw them.\n\nSometimes, though, he probably went a bit too far with it. That kind of bluntness does not always help in an environment like Manchester United, where the pressure is already high.\n\nSo when Fletcher came in with a more supportive tone and a bit of encouragement, it felt like the right change of pace from Amorim’s constant focus on “suffering”.\n\nBut it has not taken long for Fletcher to arrive at the same conclusion about the team that Amorim spoke about regularly.\n\nAfter the loss to Brighton, the former midfielder said: “I think you can see the players are fragile. You need to dig deep. Build confidence by grinding out results. Of course we want to play good football but you’ve got to find a way to do that. Once you’ve done that hard work, attitude application.”\n\nThe recurring theme of mental fragility was something that drove Amorim up the wall too.\n\nThe Portuguese coach often mentioned how United lost “in details” more than anything tied to tactics or formation.\n\nThis same issue is what Fletcher has pointed out early in his own spell in charge.\n\nThis United squad looks stronger on paper than several teams from the past, but there is a clear difference in resilience between then and now.\n\nTeams under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Jose Mourinho were known for their comebacks, something that often comes from having strong personalities and natural leaders within the squad.\n\nToday’s group is younger overall, apart from a handful of experienced voices, and many of the new signings have arrived in a dressing room still feeling the effects of last season.\n\nThe next manager will need to focus as much on building mental strength as they do on tactics because many of United’s issues stem from a lack of belief and confidence.\n\nHelping players feel more comfortable, taking some pressure off them, and creating an environment where they can perform freely should be at the top of the agenda.\n\nBut it will take time. Getting out of this rut will likely require more than just small changes or tweaks – sustained winning form is needed to break free from old patterns.",

    "fullText": "Tyson Fury is fat and out of shape … according to his father John Fury.\n\nJohn has been in and out of Tyson’s fight camps for years, taking credit when his son wins and blaming others when his son loses. While “The Gypsy King” has announced his return to fighting in 2026, it’s still not clear what role his father will play on whatever team Tyson puts together. But John says he’ll be right there with his son getting him prepared properly for one final championship run.\n\n“I am going to be more involved this time,” Fury Sr. told Goldstar Promotions. “And hear this: Father and son … Tyson’s going to win the heavyweight championship for the third time, and you can bank your f-cking money on that!”\n\nThe Fury family patriarch didn’t mince words when it came to a recent training video showing Tyson with rolls of fat spilling out over his shorts.\n\nTyson Fury back in training today looking like an absolute UNIT 😅 pic.twitter.com/Vwmvaz6mND\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) January 2, 2026\n\n“He’s not in fantastic shape, that’s bullsh-t,” John admitted. “But he will be. Have another look at him, because when I go out in the next week, there will be no more of this internet bullsh-t, every move on the internet. Head down, work, and get a body. Learn to move again. Learn to twist and be awkward. Herky jerky. Look like a fighter, man. Look like a warrior. He’ll look like a f-cking Spartan by April, and he will be heavyweight champion of the world again.”\n\nJohn pushed back on Tyson’s past claims that a little extra weight helps him fight better.\n\n“It does matter. It f-cking does matter,” John declared. “If it’s muscle, it does not matter. If it is fat, it matters. Anybody will tell you that. But listen, we know where we are going. I know where he went wrong. I know. And we are going to put it right. And if I’m wrong, I’ll walk through London, main street, with no trousers on and I’ll eat out a f-cking donkey.”",

    "description": "There are reasons to believe the all-world wide receiver could land somewhere else in 2026.",
    "fullText": "For Philadelphia Eagles fans hoping to see A.J. Brown stick with the franchise after a tumultuous season, the events during and after Sunday's Wild Card Round loss to the San Francisco 49ers could not have been reassuring.\n\nBrown, a three-time All-Pro and three-time Pro Bowl selection, has tallied 1,000-or-more receiving yards in six of his seven seasons in the league and has been crucial to the team's success in recent seasons. However, after expressing frustrations with his usage on social media earlier this season, things took a turn for the worse during the 23-19 loss to the 49ers on Sunday.\n\nBrown had multiple dropped passes on Sunday, only hauling in three receptions for 25 yards, and at one point, head coach Nick Sirianni sprinted down the field to confront Brown after he wasn't leaving the field as the Eagles attempted to punt. This sparked a face-to-face confrontation, during which the two heatedly exchanged words before being separated. Sirianni told reporters on the sidelines that \"emotions run high\" and that \"we're fine\" before diving into the confrontation in more detail after the game.\n\nAnother look at the exchange between AJ Brown and HC Nick Sirianni on the sideline. pic.twitter.com/Syn0hr0MFK\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 11, 2026\n\n“I love A.J. I think he knows how I feel about him,\" Sirianni said. \"I have a special relationship with him. We’ve probably went through every emotion you can possibly have together. We’ve laughed together, we’ve cried together, we’ve yelled at each other. We’re both emotional...that happens in this game.”\n\nBrown declined to speak with the press following the game in the locker room – he went around the locker room giving multiple teammates hugs before immediately departing the team's facilities.\n\nA.J. Brown just went around to a bunch of teammates in the locker room, hugged them, and bounced.\n\n— Jimmy Kempski (@JimmyKempski) January 12, 2026\n\nThe day's events, both on the sidelines and after the game, suggest that Brown may not feel that his previous issues have been resolved with the Eagles, and in particular, his pot-game response to the situation indicates a player who could be convinced his tenure with the franchise may soon be coming to an end.\n\nBrown, who has been with the Eagles for four seasons after starting his career with the Titans, signed an extension in 2024 that keeps him under contract through the 2029 season. Keep an eye on Brown's situation, as another trade could be in his future.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: A.J. Brown's future with Eagles in doubt after Wild Card loss.",

    "fullText": "Patriots coach Mike Vrabel talked to his team about being prepared to bleed as New England entered its first playoff game since the 2021 season.\n\nThen, shortly after Milton Williams sacked the Chargers’ Justin Herbert on Sunday night to secure the Patriots’ first playoff victory in seven years, Williams celebrated with a head-butt of Vrabel.\n\nIt knocked the first-year coach backward and bloodied his lip.\n\n“The big dogs come out in January. I think Milt took that to heart,” Vrabel said. “He came over and got me pretty good. But that’s what happens.”\n\nDrake Maye threw a touchdown pass to Hunter Henry in the fourth quarter, and New England’s defense roughed up Herbert as the Patriots beat Los Angeles 16-3 in an AFC wild-card playoff game.\n\nPLAYOFF DUBBBBBBBB pic.twitter.com/xTUemyhs8f\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 12, 2026\n\nAndy Borregales kicked three field goals for the Patriots (15-3), who hadn’t won in the postseason since their Super Bowl victory to cap the 2018 season. They’ll host the winner of Monday night’s game between Pittsburgh and Houston in the divisional round.\n\nIn his playoff debut, Maye completed 17 of 29 passes for 268 yards and ran for a team-high 66 yards.\n\n“We made plays when we had to do it,” Maye said.\n\nHe also threw an interception and lost a fumble, but the Chargers (11-7) couldn’t capitalize on those turnovers.\n\nNew England held Los Angeles to 207 yards of offense and sacked Herbert six times, with one of those resulting in a lost fumble that set up the Patriots’ TD.\n\n“It’s on us, what we do. I’ve been saying that all season,” Williams said. “We can control the game. If we do what we need to do up front, we’re going to win.”\n\nThis is the second straight season in which the Chargers have lost in the wild-card round. Herbert finished 19 of 31 for 159 yards and was his team’s leading rusher with 57 yards as he fell to 0-3 in the playoffs.\n\nHerbert was just over a month removed from surgery to repair a broken bone in his nonthrowing hand.\n\n“There was no issue,” Herbert said. “I just have to do a better job holding on to the ball.”\n\nChargers coach Jim Harbaugh said his quarterback wasn’t 100 percent.\n\nTHIS IS GORGEOUS 🎯@DrakeMaye2 | @Hunter_Henry84 \n\n📺 NBC pic.twitter.com/7TYUczWj3q\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 12, 2026\n\n“He’s a warrior. He just gives it everything he has, all the time,” Harbaugh said, acknowledging that Herbert was limited by his hand injury. “It’s an issue, but he doesn’t flinch, like a warrior would.”\n\nThe last time the Chargers failed to score a TD in the playoffs was their 21-12 AFC championship game loss to the Patriots during the 2007 season.\n\nThe Patriots drove into the red zone on their first possession of the third quarter, but the drive ended when Maye was strip-sacked by Odafe Oweh and De’Shawn Hand recovered for the Chargers.\n\nAfter Los Angeles punted, Maye connected on a pass to Kayshon Boutte that went for 42 yards to set the Patriots up on the Chargers 27. But New England settled for a 39-yard field goal that stretched their lead to 9-3.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Maye used a 16-yard pass to Boutte and a 13-yard burst by Rhamondre Stevenson to set up his precise 28-yard TD toss to Henry that put the Patriots in front 16-3.\n\nGET ON THAT!!!!!!\n\n📺 NBC pic.twitter.com/jRUgddmwbj\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 12, 2026\n\nThe Chargers picked up back-to-back first downs to open their ensuing drive. But when Herbert dropped back to pass on the next play, linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson strip-sacked him and fell on loose ball.\n\nLos Angeles had one final possession, but it ended with Herbert getting sacked by Williams on fourth down.\n\n“It’s playoff football. It’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get nasty. But you’ve got to keep going,” Williams said.\n\nThe opening quarter had lots of action, but it took until early in the second quarter for the Patriots to end a scoreless stalemate.\n\nWith New England pinned inside its own 10 after a Chargers punt, Maye had a pass intended for Austin Hooper tipped by Teair Tart and intercepted by Daiyan Henley.\n\nLos Angeles started with the ball on the Patriots 10 but was stopped on fourth-and-2 when Herbert misfired a pass to Keenan Allen.\n\nThe Patriots took over and got some breathing room via a 48-yard catch-and-run by Stevenson.\n\nThirteen plays and a fourth-down conversion later, the drive ended with Borregales’ 23-yard field goal.\n\nPatriots: CB Carlton Davis left in the first half with a toe injury but returned. ... CB Christian Gonzalez left in the second half with a head injury.\n\nPatriots: Host either Houston or Pittsburgh next Sunday.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",

    "fullText": "Inter Milan’s 2-2 draw with Napoli at San Siro has once again highlighted a growing issue in Cristian Chivu’s side: their inability to win against direct rivals.\n\nDespite twice taking the lead against Napoli, Inter were pegged back on both occasions, with Scott McTominay striking twice to deny the Nerazzurri a crucial victory.\n\nThe result leaves plenty still to play for in the Scudetto race, but it also extends a worrying run in big matches.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 11: Scott McTominay of SSC Napoli celebrates scoring his team’s second goal with teammate Amir Rrahmani during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SSC Napoli at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 11, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nInter are now without a win in their last 14 games against Milan, Napoli and Juventus across all competitions, recording seven draws and seven defeats in that period.\n\nTheir last success against one of those sides dates back to April 22, 2024, when they beat Milan in the derby to secure their 20th Scudetto under Simone Inzaghi.\n\nSince then, results in direct clashes have consistently fallen short. Last season, draws against Napoli proved costly in the title race, and a similar pattern is emerging again this year.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 11: Hakan Calhanoglu of FC Internazionale Milano celebrates scoring his team’s second goal with teammates Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Lautaro Martinez during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SSC Napoli at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 11, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nWhile tactical factors vary from game to game, the recurring theme suggests something deeper.\n\nThere is an increasing sense that Inter are suffering from a mental block in decisive fixtures, a lack of ruthlessness when it matters most. It is a problem Chivu has inherited from the final months of the Inzaghi era, and one he has yet to resolve.",

    "fullText": "The Associated Press announced the 2025 NFL All-Pro first and second teams. The Arizona Cardinals had only one player make one of the squads, and it is no surprise.\n\nFollowing his record-breaking season, tight end Trey McBride is a first-team All-Pro.\n\nHe was one vote short of joining Seattle Seahawks receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua as the only unanimous first-team All-Pros. Forty-nine of the 50 voters gave McBride a first-place vote at tight end. The other went to San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle.\n\nMcBride finished the season with 126 receptions for 1,239 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nHe was second in the NFL in catches only to Nacua, who had 129. He set an NFL single-season record for receptions by a tight end, breaking Zach Ertz' 2018 mark of 116. He broke his own single-season franchise record for receptions by a tight end and set the franchise single-season record for receptions by anyone, beating DeAndre Hopkins' 2020 mark of 115.\n\nHis 1,239 yards are the most in a season in franchise history by a tight end. He was sixth in the NFL in receiving yards and tied for second in receiving touchdowns.\n\nHe was one of very few bright spots for the Cardinals in 2025, who went 3-14.\n\nThis will surely be the first of what could be many All-Pro nods for McBride in his career. He was also named a Pro Bowler for the second straight season.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

While you want your manager to have a vision, you don’t want them to be obsessed with that over the realities of the job.\n\nChelsea group of players in the fog. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\n“I’m [only] one game in,’ the new boss said.\n\n“Some of our passages of play were beautiful to watch. We’ve got magnificent players. My idea of football is not important. It’s about winning games of football consistently.\n\n“It’s a good start. It’s just the start and we have to stay consistent now in a very, very hectic schedule.”To that end, he will basically be picking teams for freshness and fitness as much as anything.\n\nOn Wednesday night we will get our best idea of what his “first XI” is, but beyond that it’s going to be a chaotic few weeks where he’s just got to try and grind out results with whoever is fittest, with limited training time.\n\nYou can see Rosenior speaking in the clip embedded here:\n\nOnly two Chelsea players won more duels than Facundo Buonanotte last night. He played well, created a lot in limited time on the pitch, and will have impressed anyone thinking of making a move for him in the summer.\n\nLiam Rosenior got a big win in his first game – as good as you can get new a new manager.

    "description": "Matty McIntyre arrives on the South Side, ready for a superstar season",
    "fullText": "1911 \nThe White Sox purchased outfielder Matty McIntyre from the Tigers, in what turned out to be a brilliant buy. The 31-year-old was brilliant in right field for the White Sox that summer, slashing .323/.397/.401, with 102 runs, 11 triples, 17 steals and 4.2 WAR.\n\nMcIntyre slumped enough in 1912 for the White Sox to sell him to San Francisco of the Pacific Coast League, and he remained active in the minors through 1917. Sadly, McIntyre was a victim of the flu pandemic and passed away in 1920.\n\n1982 \nIn the January phase of the amateur draft that no longer exists today, the White Sox unearthed the unlikeliest of success stories. Miami Dade College’s John Cangelosi was selected with the No. 433 overall pick (including the 1981 summer draft), befitting a 5´8´´ fireplug of a player.\n\nCangelosi signed on May 11 and literally hit the ground running, swiping 45-of-52 bases at Low-A Niagra Falls.\n\nThree years later, Cangelosi made his major league debut in Chicago, and in 1986 he leapfrogged the more highly-touted Daryl Boston to make the Opening Day roster as Chicago’s center fielder and leadoff hitter. He swiped 39 bases by the All-Star break, but then was benched rather curiously by midseason manager replacement Jim Fregosi.\n\nHis best hitting game with the Sox came early in 1986, when he banged out four hits in a 4-3 loss to Milwaukee at Comiskey Park on April 9.\n\nTraded to Pittsburgh after the 1986 season, Cangelosi would play 11 more years in the big leagues, winning a World Series with the 1997 Florida Marlins. He amassed 6.1 career WAR.\n\n1994 \nSteve Carlton, who pitched a little bit with the White Sox in 1986 (4-3, 3.69 ERA, 0.7 WAR as a GM Ken Harrelson waiver-wire pickup in the second half), was elected to the Hall of Fame with near-96% first-ballot support. Brief White Sox coach Orlando Cepeda (who Bill Veeck brought back to baseball after a prison sentence, and who tried to acquire Cepeda during his first run of White Sox ownership) fell seven votes short of the 75% election threshold.\n\n2000 \nGM Ron Schueler made amends for some of his worst moves by shipping disgruntled pitcher Jamie Navarro along with pitcher John Snyder to the Milwaukee Brewers for long ball-hitting shortstop José Valentín and pitcher Cal Eldred.\n\nNavarro lost a majors-high 43 games during his three years on the South Side, compiled -3.7 WAR and is a whisper ahead of James Shields as the worst regular-use starting pitcher in team history.\n\nOn the other hand, both Valentín and Eldred would play a large part in the unexpected division championship for the South Siders in 2000. Eldred went 10-2 in 20 starts for the team before an elbow injury in July basically ended his White Sox career. Valentín played five years with the White Sox, averaging 120 hits, 27 home runs and 76 RBIs — and he was a Cubs-killer.\n\nOne of the highlights in Jose’s White Sox stint was a very rare accomplishment — a “natural” cycle, against the Orioles on April 27, 2000. He singled in the first inning, doubled in the second, tripled in the third and homered in the eighth inning in a 13-4 win — all-in-all, 4-for-5 with five RBIs and two runs.\n\n2007 \nAfter five years in the White Sox system culminating in … eight plate appearances for the 2006 club, catcher Chris Stewart was shipped to the Rangers for reliever John Lujan. Lujan would pitch for three years in the White Sox system, getting only as far as Double-A Birmingham in 2009 — he would pitch for two more years in organized ball and then until 2016 in independent and Latin American leagues, but never saw The Show. Stewart had a marginal (1.3 WAR) career, but bounced around 11 teams after the White Sox and played until 2018 — 457 games in all.\n\nThis was the second deal the White Sox made with Texas over a three-week period, along with the John Danks–Brandon McCarthy trade of Dec. 23, 2006.\n\n2009 \nThe White Sox signed minor league free agent shortstop Sergio Santos to an MiLB deal. Santos, a 2002 first round pick by the Arizona Diamondbacks, had struggled as a hitter, seeing his career OPS slip to less than .700 (.699) at the time of his release.\n\nThe White Sox would ship Santos to San Francisco in a conditional trade late in 2009’s Spring Training, as he still wished to try to make it as a hitter. However, an educated guess says that the condition of the trade was that Santos would be returned to Chicago if he did not impress the Giants with his hitting.\n\nTwo weeks later he was back in the White Sox organization — and was sent to extended spring training to convert into a pitcher.",

    "fullText": "When Hollow Knight: Silksong came out last summer I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it. Could a video game teach me anything new about suffering?\n\nLast year I became uncomfortably well acquainted with suffering. In March I started experiencing excruciating pain in my right arm and shoulder – burning, zapping, energy-sapping pain that left me unable to think straight, emanating from a nexus of torment behind my shoulder blade and sometimes stretching all the way up to the base of my skull and all the way down into my fingers. Typing was agony, but everything was painful; even at rest it was horrible. I couldn’t play my guitar; I couldn’t play video games; I couldn’t sleep. I learned how quickly physical suffering lacerates your mental wellbeing.\n\nI’d had episodes of nagging pain from so-called repetitive strain injuries before, the product of long hours hunched over laptops and game controllers over the course of decades, but nothing like this. A few months later, after the initial unrelenting agony had subsided to a permanent hum of more moderate pain, it was diagnosed as brachial neuritis, inflammation of the nerve path that travels from the base of your neck down to your hand. (Nobody knows what causes it, but it sometimes happens after an infection or an injury.) The good news, I was told by a neurologist, was that it usually gets better in about one to three years, and I hadn’t lost any function in my right hand. The bad news was that there was nothing much to be done about the pain in the meantime.\n\nTraditional pain meds don’t really do much for nerve pain. And after trying out the small range of nerve pain medications – pills that act on the brain, where pain really lives – I discovered that they all sent me loopy in ways I would rather not ever experience again. So I had to figure out how to live with it. My nerves were upset; they had now learned the pain. It would take time to unlearn it.\n\nIn August, meanwhile, a small Australian developer called Team Cherry announced a release date for a game that had been in the works for many years. Silksong was the follow-up to Hollow Knight, a title I had loved when it came out in 2017: an atmospheric and enticingly challenging game about fighting your way through a corrupted underground bug kingdom. Silksong was so hotly anticipated that it became a meme; its name appeared in the comments under every gaming showcase for over half a decade, while Team Cherry remained resolutely silent about when it was coming out. Posters on Reddit started mock-ritually-sacrificing each other in an effort to manifest its release. Now it was finally coming out, and I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it.\n\nThere is an underlying narrative of overcoming the odds – of suffering and redemption – in almost all video games, but especially the difficult ones. And I love the difficult ones. Video games imbue suffering with meaning: you try and fail, try and fail, until you succeed. Perhaps, I thought, playing Silksong during a period of real-life suffering and disability might help me look at it differently.\n\nSilksong has the appearance of a very beautiful nightmare, and the energy of a horror-tinged European animated TV show you only half-remember from your childhood. Its player character, Hornet, is a masked spider in a red cloak; the other characters are oddly cute but dead-eyed bug creatures, hunched over with their own suffering. Beginning at the foot of the kingdom of Pharloom, you travel through moss-furred, luminescent caverns, moonlit temples, wind and sand-blasted wastelands, tight winding tunnels whose walls are made of cogs or tarnished bells, up towards the once gleaming Citadel at the top. Bugs have been making pilgrimages to the Citadel for untold generations but they rarely survive the journey. There is precious little life anywhere, and what there is will try to kill you. Something has poisoned their minds.\n\nThe journey mirrors Dante’s in The Divine Comedy from hell through purgatory to heaven, from cursed depths to the home of god. The piteous outpost where Hornet begins the game is little more than a shanty town; rag-clad bugs huddled in a place of temporary safety. The populace of Pharloom accepts their fate, cowering in every settlement with blank stares and sorrowful posture: this is how things are meant to be. Like any pilgrimage, the way to the Citadel involves enormous hardship before you come close to divinity. I was told this over and over by the bugs I met in between my battles with the feral beasts and corrupted priests that stood in my way – battles that often sent me back to a checkpoint, fuming, 10 or 20 or 50 times before I finally defeated them.\n\nExcept Silksong’s supposed heaven is hellish in itself. Once you get there, up to the Citadel – past the fog-wreathed swamp guarded by the vicious, flapping Moorwing, past the silk-wreathed Widow that holds the gilded town of Bellhart in a frightening state of suspended animation, past the Last Judge who guards the grand gate, swinging a flaming thurible that can end you in seconds with waves and columns of sweeping fire – you find that it has fallen, too. There is no point to the suffering of the pilgrims who come here. If they survive, there is only more suffering ahead. The highest places turn out to be some of the worst.\n\nThe Citadel is barely the halfway point of the game, however. Past that gate, Pharloom branches in all directions. Deep, deep below, there is a roiling furnace; in Sinners Road you find where the prisoners of the realm have been left to rot; there is an abandoned hospital, a pitiless wind-whipped mountain of ice, a museum of sorts that takes you through the realm in miniature (why is it there?). The guardians of these places become ever more punishing. I nearly lost my mind fighting Trobbio, the dancer, the flamboyant performer, trapped for ever on his stage, theatrically intoning his own name as he destroys me with pyrotechnics.\n\nHornet gleams silk-bright in this dismal world. Within her is the substance that holds Pharloom’s minds in thrall, the godly silk. She whips her divine power around herself like ribbons, to heal the damage done to her. She speaks with clarity and compassion, to bugs that respond in riddles or threats, half-mad. She plucks melodies on a stringed instrument that make the bugs around her turn their faces upwards and sing in disconnected couplets. And she fights: with her sharp-pointed needle, with bone-crafted boomerangs and plant-poison and flea-brew, with sharp tacks and javelin-spears and anything else she can find in Pharloom. She fights and fights, and yet beyond each battle waits another.\n\nHampered by pain, I am forced to explore all of this very, very slowly. It takes me months to make my way painstakingly through a game I would have rinsed in three weeks in my previous life. My pilgrimage cannot be rushed. A lot of managing pain involves cultivating a state of safety for your nervous system, minimising stress as much as possible, and it turns out that difficult video games are very stressful. The frustration of failure causes my hands to grip the controller too hard and my fingers begin to hurt. The adrenaline of victory sends me into a state of exhilarated fight-or-flight that my nerves can’t currently handle. Instead of disappearing into Silksong like I have with other games since I was a teenager, I play for 20, 40 minutes at a time, over months.\n\nUnexpectedly, this makes Pharloom begin to feel like a parallel dimension, somewhere I can slip into not just on my Nintendo Switch but in my mind. I have to stop playing when pain starts to travel to my hand, so I keep playing it in my head.\n\nI see the Cogwork Dancers, the balletic mechanical twin bosses at the very top of the Citadel, flitting in front of my mind’s eye in their predictable attack patterns. I think about the shaft I found in a corner of the Blasted Steps and wonder whether I can get up there with the piton-like tool that Hornet recently acquired. I think, all the time, about what happened in Pharloom; the clawed grip of religion on the minds of its populace, who cling to their rosary beads even as they lose their grasp on their own minds. I think about the tall princeling I rescued from a cell, crouched over the remains of one of the Cogwork Dancers: his partner, long ago.\n\nYou can tell that this game is a work of obsession. The detail everywhere is extraordinary, even in the writhing maggots that carpet the ground in the aptly named Putrified Ducts. But also, where in most game worlds everything feels oriented towards the player – fun playgrounds laid out for your enjoyment, a daub of yellow paint here and there to show you where to go – Hornet’s presence, my presence, feels almost incidental to Pharloom. It rots away without me, bugs chanting their devotions, patrolling silk-poisoned clerics clanging their bells. I come upon a settlement and am not welcomed as a saviour, but regarded through a veil of suspicion and despair.\n\nIndeed, some places in Pharloom aren’t fun at all. They’re places I never want to see again. Late one night I find myself in Bilewater, a fetid parkour course over more pools of writhing maggots and past bile-spitting moss-monsters. I am here to find Shakra the warrior-cartographer, whose haunting song has guided me towards her throughout Pharloom, scrabbling for rosaries to pay for her maps. Her trail is marked with bronze rings, a detail I can’t believe I didn’t notice earlier in the game, but it takes me days of spaced-out play to make the journey from the nearest safe bench to the tranquil pool where she rests. Trickster creatures follow me, setting tripwires and traps that make it even harder to avoid the gaping mouths, slashing teeth and erratic movements of the native creatures here. It brought me to the verge of tears.\n\nGiving up never felt like an option. I’ve taken breaks from Silksong – a week or two at a time – but I have not given up, not even when I got stuck in an almost-impossible gauntlet involving waves of aggressive crows. Silksong feels like a sadistic game at times, needlessly punishing: take a hit and it’ll often wipe not one but two precious units of Hornet’s health. I’m not sure why I didn’t quit. It wasn’t pure obstinacy. I think that because I was suffering all of the time anyway, adding a bit more suffering into my days by choice at least gave me a feeling of control.\n\nDifficult video games require tenacity and resilience. Keep throwing yourself at the problem unrelentingly until you defeat it, they teach you. There’s nothing you can’t do with enough skill and determination. You can always win. You just have to try hard enough.\n\nThis does not apply to pain. No amount of effort will persuade nerves to heal any faster, and pain is not something that can be overcome with sheer determination. I’ve carried plenty of strategies from video games into my real life before: I have applied the same bullheaded tenacity to learning languages, writing books, supporting and caring for my friends and family. But nothing I’ve ever learned from video games has helped me deal with pain. Instead I’ve had to learn how to do things more slowly, stay within my capacity, and admit my limitations without guilt or self-admonishment.\n\nI did not know that I could do things slowly. I didn’t know that I would be able to play Silksong slowly. But I have learned how. As I have been playing through this game I have also been reading endlessly about modern pain science. At first I was doing this rather desperately, in search of a way out, a way to speed things up, to get myself out of suffering. What I learned instead is that acknowledging pain is the first step to learning to live with it, and that learning to live with it is what it actually means to overcome it. Pain is the brain’s danger signal: if you ignore it, it only gets louder. If you start listening instead, observing and acquiescing, your brain might put away the megaphone. I have learned that acknowledging pain and modifying your life around it does not mean giving up. It means you get to keep on living – keep on playing.\n\nAfter four months and 40 hours, I have done almost everything there is to do in Pharloom. I am fighting the very final boss, and I have been trying to defeat her since before Christmas. I hoped I might finish this game before the end of 2025, a neat little piece of symbolism to represent perseverance through an extremely challenging year. It hasn’t worked out quite so elegantly, but Silksong has helped me look at suffering a little differently. There doesn’t need to be a point to it; it doesn’t necessarily come with a tidy narrative of perseverance and eventual redemption. But you can learn to work around it. You can make your way through.\n\nSuper Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

    "fullText": "Media bosses expect web referrals to plunge and want journalists to emulate content creators, report finds\n\nMedia companies expect web traffic to their sites from online searches to plummet over the next three years, as AI summaries and chatbots change the way consumers use the internet.\n\nAn overwhelming majority are also planning to encourage their journalists to behave more like YouTube and TikTok content creators this year, as short-form video and audio content continues to boom.\n\nThe findings are drawn from a new report from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which included the views of 280 media leaders from 51 countries. It found media executives around the world fear search engine referrals will fall by 43% over three years.\n\nSearch traffic to news sites has already plunged by a third in a single year globally, with the rise of AI overviews and chatbots, as well as changes to the search algorithms that have been the lifeblood of some media companies since the rise of the internet.\n\nGoogle search is down 33% globally, according to new data for more than 2,500 news sites sourced by Chartbeat. The figure is even higher for the US.\n\nLifestyle, celebrity and travel content is being much more heavily affected than current affairs and news outlets so far. Publications carrying out live reporting and current affairs are more protected from AI summaries.\n\nGoogle’s AI Overviews already appear at the top of about 10% of search results in the US, according to the report, and are rapidly rolling out elsewhere. Referrals to media sites from ChatGPT are growing, but the report still described these referrals as “little more than a rounding error”.\n\nNic Newman, senior research associate at the institute, said the “traffic era” for online publishers, which had sustained them since the advent of the internet, was coming to an end.\n\n“It is not clear what comes next,” he said. “Publishers fear that AI chatbots are creating a new convenient way of accessing information that could leave news brands – and journalists – out in the cold.\n\n“But tech platforms do not hold all the cards. Reliable news, expert analysis and points of view remain important both to individuals and to society, particularly in uncertain times. Great storytelling – and a human touch – is going to be hard for AI to replicate.”\n\nThere has already been a swing away from simply trying to score big hits through web traffic – with fewer people clicking on a link to a story. Instead, more companies have moved towards a subscription model that gives them a direct relationship with their audience.\n\nThe Reuters Institute report also revealed a scramble among media companies to invest in digital platforms like YouTube and TikTok as short-form video use continues to grow. Many also want to encourage their journalists to embrace the content creator culture that the platforms have popularised.\n\nThree-quarters of media managers surveyed said they will be trying to get their staff to behave more like creators in 2026. Half are planning to partner with creators to help distribute their content.\n\nDowning Street is also trying to tap into social media as Keir Starmer attempts to find ways of reaching Gen Z and bypass the traditional media.\n\nThe campaigner Anna Whitehouse, who goes by Mother Pukka, and the personal finance influencers Cameron Smith and Abi Foster have all been given access to senior ministers in recent months.",

Through systematic analysis of programming language token representations, we characterize how programming languages are encoded in LLM tokenizers by analyzing their vocabulary distribution and keyword coverage patterns. We introduce a novel cold-start probability analysis method that provides insights into model behavior without requiring explicit prompts. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of how different model optimization techniques - including quantization, distillation, model scaling, and task-specific fine-tuning - affect token-level representations and code generation quality. Our experiments, supported by comprehensive probability distribution analysis and evaluation metrics, reveal critical insights into token-level behavior and provide empirically-validated guidelines for maintaining code generation quality under various optimization constraints.",

Unfortunately, that report has turned out to be inaccurate as Larian has confirmed that its wildly popular D&D will not be coming to Nintendo's console.\nDuring a recent AMA session on Reddit, Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke acknowledged that the company wanted to work on a Switch 2 port, but it was denied.\n\"We would have loved to [bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Switch 2], but [it] wasn't our decision to make,\" wrote Vincke. That likely means the port was either shot down by Nintendo or by Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast, which controls the rights for all things Dungeons & Dragons-related.",

    "description": "What games should you play on Xbox Game Pass?",
    "fullText": "and \n Darryn Bonthuys\n on January 12, 2026 at 3:40AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, narrowing down the best Xbox Game Pass games currently available can be a challenge. The subscription service has grown in size, offering a massive library of big AAA games, new day-one releases, and even overlooked gems--like one of 2025's best games, Blue Prince. The library is so expansive that you're almost guaranteed to find at least a few games you'll love and classics from yesteryear, thanks to the recent addition of Retro Classics.\n\nTo help you navigate the ever-shifting landscape, we've rounded up the very best Game Pass games available now. There are plenty more excellent games on Xbox Game Pass than the ones we’ve listed below--the service is loaded with worthy games. These are just the games we think every Xbox owner should play, and we regularly review this list to make sure we stand by our choices and rotate in newer releases. We'll continue to update this list as the Game Pass library adds new selections. Every month brings new games as well, and in case you missed it, here's what you can download and play in December.\n\nKeep in mind that Xbox Game Pass comes in various tiers at different pricing levels, which were increased in November 2025: Essential, Premium, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass Essential offers a catalogue of 50+ games and online multiplayer, while Premium bumps the number of playable games to 200. Game Pass Ultimate is the top-tier service that provides access to all games on day one, cloud streaming, and several more perks.\n\nFor the purposes of this list, we looked at the whole Xbox Game Pass library available in the Ultimate tier, so if you're subscribed to one of the other tiers--especially Essential--not every recommendation may be available. And while this list is a good place to get started, the library of games is even more expansive, and more games will be added throughout the year. Be sure to check back for updated recommendations.\n\nSome of the best games on Game Pass are the ones that push the limits on what a genre is capable of, letting you sample ambitious ideas for the cost of your subscription. In the case of The Alters, you're getting a fascinating blend of survival, base-building, and resource management. The catch here are the human resources you have to work with, as protagonist Jan Dolski's mission to escape an inhospitable planet is aided by his alternate selves, reflections of who he could have been if he'd made a different choice in life. The end result is both mechanically and narratively fascinating in this ambitious fusion of ideas from the studio behind This War of Mine.\n\nWho knows when Fallout 5 will ever emerge from a vault to see the light of day, but until then, games like Atomfall are proudly carrying the survival-action torch in its place. Inspired by the classic Bethesda series and the real-life Windscale Power Plant fire, Atomfall wastes no time throwing you into a weird and mysterious world. Full of existential dread and British charm, you're free to chart your own path as you either journey deeper into the unknown or find yourself taking a detour from the golden path in this delightfully open-ended game.\n\nFollowing a dip into sci-fi with The Outer Worlds, Obsidian's return to an RPG fantasy setting is one of this year's biggest surprises. Set in the Pillars of Eternity universe, you play as a godlike--one who has been touched by a god leaving you marked in a way that's visually distinct to everyone around you. Your journey through the Living Lands makes a point to streamline some classic RPG systems, while giving you an incredible amount of flexibility in others. Combat is a particular standout, as you can mix and match just about any variety of weapons and abilities, and easily respec to experiment with new combinations.\n\nBalatro was a breakout release last year--in fact, it was one of our favorite games of 2024--and the one-more-round roguelike poker game has only gotten better with subsequent updates. It's now available on Xbox Game Pass, and came alongside a new Friends of Jimbo pack that lets you change the face cards to crossovers with games like Civilization VII, Assassin's Creed, Fallout, Bugsnax, and more. If you've never caught up with the incredibly compelling and clever game, now is the time.\n\nYou've never played a game quite like Blue Prince. The first-person puzzle game has you exploring an empty mansion, but this particular manor house has a special quality: It's never the same from day to day, as the rooms appear as you \"draft\" them from a selection whenever you come to a door. The ultimate goal is to explore the mansion and reach the hidden Room 46, but the game's many puzzles and mysteries unfold and interlock in ways that feel constantly enthralling. And since it's on Game Pass, it's easy to recommend with your existing subscription.\n\nThe Call of Duty series has been among the top sellers for years, but some CoD games are clearly better than others. This year's iteration, Black Ops 6, is the best the series has been in some time, and the first time that a new Call of Duty game has been available on Game Pass at launch. The campaign is a smart and varied action spectacle that keeps you on your toes as it explores paranoid thriller tropes set against global events in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the multiplayer's new omni-movement makes matches feel fast and fluid, especially with the addition of inventive new maps that let you explore the space in a variety of ways. A revision to the perks system helps you specialize in interesting ways. Call of Duty has earned its reputation for a reason, and this latest release shows why.\n\nRead our Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign review and multiplayer review.\n\nAn impeccably crafted indie platformer, Celeste is known for its tough-but-fair difficulty and surprisingly emotionally engaging story. As you climb the mountain you'll come face to face with devilish platforming challenges that will test your skill, all while discovering a subtle story of self-discovery and overcoming depression. It has a stellar 94 score on Metacritic, so don't sleep on this one. And don't worry if you aren't a platforming pro, as Celeste has a full suite of difficulty modifiers that let you experience the climb on your own terms.\n\nWhen Microsoft finalized its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it seemed like only a matter of time before the studio's massive library started to come to Game Pass. We're still waiting on a lot of the catalog, but it started with a big one. The latest in the beloved dungeon-crawling RPG series Diablo, Diablo IV, lets you delve into the deep and macabre world of Sanctuary to protect it from Lillith, the demon mother. With deep and immersive character building and a regular cadence of seasonal content to let you further expand your characters with new abilities, Diablo IV is not to be missed.\n\nBigger, bolder, and more brutal than ever, Id Software unleashed hell on Earth with Doom Eternal, much to the delight of everyone who played this sequel. Pure action from start to finish and unrelenting when the armies of the damned were thrown at you, Doom Eternal is a metal journey through the apocalypse that takes no prisoners.\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages feels like a return to form for id Software's iconic series. While Doom Eternal would regularly leave you breathless with its hyper-kinetic gameplay and resource-juggling, The Dark Ages keeps the action grounded by transforming the Doom Slayer into an overpowered engine of destruction. The stand-and-fight mantra guiding this prequel works wonders, while the bullet-hell challenge and shield-bashing gameplay makes ripping and tearing through demonic hordes feel more satisfying than ever.\n\nRead our Doom: The Dark Ages review.\n\nFBC: Firebreak takes a while to get going, but once all of its pieces fall into place, this co-op first-person-shooter is an exciting stab at the live-service genre. The Control spin-off also makes a statement to the current hamster wheel of FOMO that live-service games attempt to force players to run on, making it a breath of fresh air in an industry where your attention span has become a valuable commodity.\n\nRead our FBC: Firebreak review.\n\nBetween its amazing visuals, myriad gameplay options, and bevy of content, Forza Horizon 5 is a racing game that anyone can enjoy. From a technical standpoint, it’s remarkable what the team at Playground Games achieved--everything from the meticulously detailed vehicle models to the lush virtual recreations of Mexico’s landscapes are visually engrossing.. Better yet, the gameplay is some of the best in the racing genre. Unlike the simulation-heavy Forza Motorsport line, the Forza Horizon series lean towards arcade racing, emphasizing player freedom in vast open worlds. Forza Horizon 5 doubles down on the philosophy, letting players focus on the type of experience they want--be that tense races against other players, single-player challenges and story content, or just chilling out and cruising the open road.\n\nRead our Forza Horizon 5 review.\n\nForza Motorsport goes back to the series' roots as a simulation track racer, with stunning recreations of high performance vehicles. Car progression and upgrades are streamlined enough for fans to understand, but with the ability to get your hands dirty under the hood with precise fine-tuning. It's a graphical showpiece for the Xbox, making it a great game to try on Game Pass regardless of whether you're a gear-head.\n\nRead our Forza Motorsport review.\n\nThe original Gears of War landed on Xbox 360 almost 20 years ago, and in a testament to its enduring popularity, this updated version of the classic still feels as fun to play today as it was in 2006. The game is still a tightly constructed shooter with plenty of blockbuster moments and one of the best weapons in gaming history, the Lancer chainsaw-rifle. This version polishes it up for modern-day hardware, but the gameplay remains as polished as ever while you work your way through encounters with the Locust army. Or as protagonist Marcus Fenix would say, nice.\n\nGears Tactics cleverly applies the aesthetic and atmosphere of the franchise to a tactics game. Despite being a totally different genre, Gears Tactics still feels like a natural addition to the iconic franchise thanks to sound mechanics and great level design. Many of the notable Gears of War gameplay systems and quirks are adapted into the top-down tactical spin on the genre. With a meaningful progression system, deep but approachable tactical encounters, and a number of great boss battles, Gears Tactics is a can’t-miss experience for Gears aficionados and strategy game fans alike.\n\nObsidian's survival-crafting sequel builds on the strong foundation established by the first game to deliver a vibrant alternative to all of the gloomy survival games on the market today. It's still in an early access phase, but if history repeats itself, we're expecting Grounded 2 to be a bigger and better sequel that remains fun to play while Obsidian continues to fine-tune it.\n\nIf you’ve never played the Halo franchise before, Halo: The Master Chief Collection is the perfect place to start. The Master Chief Collection comes with six Halo games, including remastered versions of the first two original Xbox entries. Halo features some of the very best single-player campaigns in the genre as well as extremely solid online multiplayer, at least after years of fixes and improvements. Back when the collection was originally released, the online multiplayer was spotty to say the least, but it has come a long way. Halo: The Master Chief Collection offers the best way to play some of the most heralded first-person shooters ever created.\n\nRead our Halo: The Master Chief Collection review.\n\nHi-Fi Rush is a bright, popcorn animated adventure from the studio that brought you… The Evil Within? As surprising as that is, what may be even more impressive is that this is an absolute gem of a rhythm-action game. The original IP follows Chai, a good-hearted doofus who signs up for free cybernetic surgery and ends up with a Zune grafted into his chest. He comes out of the other side with the power to defeat corporate ne'er-do-wells to the gyrating beat of the world. It's like Elite Beat Agents mashed together with Devil May Cry.\n\nEnchanting and utterly engrossing, Hollow Knight is one of the best metroidvanias ever made. Team Cherry’s adventure stars a nameless knight armed with a nail who explores a labyrinthine world known as Hallownest. With a gorgeous art style and an incredible amount of variation in the environments, Hollow Knight’s expansive world is a constant joy to explore. Challenging combat rewards those with patience and perseverance. Hollow Knight truly stands out in a fairly crowded genre. If you haven’t waded through Hallownest yet, now’s a great time to slay some insect ahead of the sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong.\n\nAfter years of waiting--and several summoning circles--Hollow Knight: Silksong has finally arrived and it's turning out to be an overwhelming follow-up to its predecessor. Team Cherry's Hollow Knight follow-up builds on a successful formula, evolving it to a near-perfect state where you get to explore labyrinthine worlds, challenge powerful foes, and master a nuanced combat system as the protagonist, Hornet.\n\nOne of 2024'sbest shooters, I Am Your Beast is the kind of game you boot up when you're looking for quick but satisfying fun. Developed by Strange Scaffold, the studio behind another cult-classic,El Paso, Elsewhere, I Am Your Beast reinvents the movie trope of a retired special forces agent being called in for one last job and transforms it into a stylish gauntlet of danger as you sprint, slide, and shoot your way through entire armies of goons. The fast-paced nature of the game means that you have to think quickly if you want to avoid a bullet to the head, and each successful run is an exhilarating experience.\n\nMachineGames' take on Indiana Jones is a masterful take on the famous relic hunter. The action is a tightly designed clockwork of action, stealth, and immersive-sim elements that capture Indy's famous improvisational style. The story is rich and engaging and belongs right on the shelf next to some of Indy's other great adventures. And the character and worldbuilding are all top-notch, which helps to sell Troy Baker's take on the famous character popularized by actor Harrison Ford. It's the complete package, and a great reason to \n\nRead our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review.\n\nKeeper is exactly the kind of game that Game Pass needs. A weird and experimental title from Double Fine, Keeper is an artistic triumph with a heartfelt tale at its core. Constantly interesting on a visual level and frequently reinventing itself with new gameplay hooks, Keeper is a strong example of why video games can be considered art.\n\nLost in Random: The Eternal Die wears its Hades influence proudly on its sleeve, but this roguelike action game also has several novel ideas of its own. The roll of the dice plays a crucial part in determining just how well--or poorly-- your next run will go, and with a gripping story to boot, the game puts a fun spin on a familiar genre.\n\nThough it's still in early access, Manor Lords has quickly gained a following as a deep and engrossing strategy game that encompasses several different types of strategy at once. You'll build a city with complex social and economic systems at play, as well as take part in huge tactical battles against rival lords. Building your civilization from almost nothing and helping it manage trials like an unforgiving winter is so satisfying, and the depth of the game is made even more impressive by it being the work of just one developer.\n\nManagement sims are--by design--a stressful time. Sure, the sense of victory that comes from braving an administrative adventure is second to none, but Minami Lane puts a cozy spin on this genre so that your blood pressure doesn't spike. It's a digestible city-builder with a wholesome vibe that is worth checking out.\n\nSave the Spire saw a new wave of roguelike deckbuilders follow in its wake, and Monster Train was easily one of the best. The bar was set high for the sequel, but Monster Train 2 is a confident follow-up to the first game that builds on its solid foundation and adds a few new twists and a tremendous amount of replayability.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong is dominating the metroidvania charts right now, but don't sleep on Nine Sols. Beautifully crafted and featuring a rich hand-drawn art style, the game combines its metroidvania influences with Sekiro-inspired combat to create tense and exciting moments in every level you explore. The smooth animation combined with the responsive controls makes for a winning formula, while the \"Taopunk\" setting gives the game a unique look and feel.\n\nWhen all the pieces fall together, Ninja Gaiden 4 offers an intoxicating blend of action and challenge. The first mainline entry in many years, Ninja Gaiden 4 is focused purely on gameplay and over-the-top boss fights that'll push you to the very edge of your seat. It's the purest lean-forward game out there, a fast-paced meat-grinder that requires your utmost concentration, but being in the zone with this game is an absolute treat once you start dishing out gruesome combos. The story and its lead protagonist are instantly forgettable, but the experience of scraping through battles against ultra-aggressive enemies and tanky bosses will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nRead our Ninja Gaiden 4 review.\n\nBoth games in Moon Studios’ incredible Ori series are worth playing. Ori and the Blind Forest and its 2020 sequel Ori and the Will of the Wisps are two of the best platformers available on Xbox. Both have stunning visuals and tell emotionally gripping stories that feed off of the atmosphere and well-drawn characters. While they are similar in terms of aesthetic and feel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is more action-oriented, whereas the Blind Forest largely focuses on platforming and exploration. The Will of the Wisps gives Ori new abilities that help them square off against daunting bosses. Both games are brilliant in their own right, and are must-play platformers on Xbox. You should play them in order to get the full emotional weight of the story.\n\nRead our Ori and Will of the Wisps review.\n\nWho knows when Fallout will make its grand return, but until then, The Outer Worlds continues to be a fine substitute for Bethesda's series. To its credit, The Outer Worlds 2 makes great strides in cementing its own identity, as this tongue-in-cheek take on sci-fi adventures from a bygone era and late-stage capitalism run amok puts its own spin on a familiar formula. With combat options that feel more flexible, a quirky cast of characters to meet, and a distinct sense of satire that allows it to poke the corporate space-bear, Obsidian's sequel is a spacefaring delight.\n\nRead our The Outer Wilds 2 review.\n\nOne of the most unusual games on Game Pass, or anywhere, Pentiment is an adventure game set in 16th century Bavaria. As a manuscript illustrator sent to an Abbey, you're caught up in a series of murders. The decades-spanning story explores the idea of historical narrative and how truth is recorded and remembered across generations. It's really unlike anything else.\n\nThe first Pillars of Eternity was a thrilling study in old school RPG gameplay with a modern makeover, but its sequel outdoes the original in almost every way possible. A more confident follow-up that doubles down on its strengths while further refining its formula, Obsidian Entertainment's sophomore effort is an entertaining game filled with rich writing and easily-accessible gameplay for newcomers to the genre.\n\nRead our Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire review.\n\nIt's safe to say that there's no game like Psychonauts 2 on the market, as Double Fine's return to the cult-classic world of Razputin Aquato and the titular psychic peacekeeping agency is an absolute mind-blast of imaginative design. Fun to play and packing an emotional wallop with its exploration of several characters and a deep dive into their respective psyches, Psychonauts 2 is both a hilarious and heartfelt effort.\n\nThe first Plague Tale was an unexpected hit from a relatively small developer punching above its weight. The sequel could have expanded its scope, but instead, Asobo Studio kept its narrative tightly focused on telling a human story set in an alternative French history. Though the rat-controlling mechanics have been expanded, the story is still concerned primarily with the family dynamics between Hugo and his protective older sister, Amicia. It's also a downright beautiful game, with lush environments that rival those from the biggest AAA studios.\n\nRead our A Plague Tale: Requiem review.\n\nFootball fans don't have much to choose from in the genre, thanks to EA dominating the scene with its annual EA Sports FC series. But in 2025, Sifu developer Sloclap hit the field with a game that felt and played like the polar opposite of EA's franchise. A refreshing skill-based approach to football, Rematch keeps things simple, engaging, and exciting with every footie match. Fun to learn and satisfying to master, recent improvements have addressed the rougher parts of the game, transforming it into a thrilling spectacle of five-a-side football.\n\nUsing the momentum from Resident Evil 7 to push the franchise to gory new heights, 2021's Resident Evil Village continues the terrifying journey of protagonist Ethan Winters. Venturing into a mysterious European village teeming with all manner of new bioweapon horrors, Resident Evil Village plays like a highlight reel of the series with its grotesque monster designs, action-packed horror gameplay, and suspense-fueled design that keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times.\n\nRead our Resident Evil Village review.\n\nIt's a great time to be a Prince of Persia fan, as not only have we gotten the superb metroidvania The Lost Crown, but also Evil Empire's fun roguelike The Rogue Prince of Persia. After spending several months in Steam Early Access, the full game is a terrific love-letter to classic Prince of Persia action, mixing the influences of the older platforming games with plenty of Dead Cells DNA. Where The Rogue Prince of Persia sets itself apart is in its movement and storytelling, as the game is at its best when you're using parkour to smoothly dodge traps and acrobatic combat to weave between enemies as you build up strength for a glorious run.\n\nA live-service game that's not all about the shooting, Sea of Thieves is Rare's quirky take on a pirate simulator. It's gone through a lot of iterations since it was first released in 2018, so nowadays it's a full-fledged pirate simulator. You can crew your ship and sail the high seas, plunder other ships, find hidden treasure, and even deal with otherworldly pirate ghosts.\n\nRead our Sea of Thieves review.\n\nSlay the Spire marries deck-building with roguelike systems to create one of the best indies in recent years. Throughout your journey up the Spire, you square off against monsters, uncover treasures, and expand your deck of cards. Slay the Spire's card-based combat is easy to get the hang of but requires trial and error to find success. While you have to start back at the beginning each time you die, you gradually earn new cards, which help you advance further the next time. It’s an intoxicating loop that makes it easy to want to try “one more time” before putting down the controller. Each of Slay the Spire’s four playable characters have unique decks, adding a ton of incentive to brave the Spire for subsequent runs after the credits roll.\n\nRead our Slay the Spire review.\n\nCompulsion Games has repeatedly designed incredible worlds that are rich in atmosphere and intrigue, and South of Midnight is no exception. Set in the American Deep South and inspired by the myths told by the people who live there, South of Midnight encapsulates the sights, sounds, and culture of a place rarely explored in video games and doesn't shy away from delving into the community's hardships and traumas to weave together a fantastical and oftentimes chilling gothic horror tale. The whole experience is brought to life with superb voice acting and a poignant soundtrack, transforming otherwise ordinary moments of combat and platforming into a cinematic experience that's well-worth experiencing.\n\nRead our South of Midnight review.\n\nStar Wars Outlaws might be a one-and-done game, but Ubisoft's dive into the seedier underbelly of that famous sci-fi franchise is a thrill ride. Ditching lightsabers for blasters and a shoot-first attitude, Outlaws succeeds in making you feel like a scoundrel as you explore planets, double-cross crime cartels regularly, and do your best to stay off the radar of the Galactic Empire and its seemingly limitless supply of Stormtroopers. Come for the interstellar adventure and stay for the high-stakes Sabacc table in this open-world gem.\n\nRead our Star Wars Outlaws review.\n\nWhat's old is new again, as the best Tony Hawk games are kick-flipping their way back into relevance. While we're still not sold on the changes made to THPS4 in this two-for-one special, there's no denying that the subtle changes under the hood and the new coat have paint have helped to successfully bring the series into the modern age of gaming. There's also a healthy amount of new content here that doesn't detract from the nostalgic appeal of these games, making it a must-play for veterans and newcomers alike.\n\nRead our Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4 review.\n\nTunic, the long-awaited adventure starring a fox with a sword, is more than just a great Zelda-like. While it harks back to old-school Zelda games in terms of not guiding players toward the objectives, Tunic has its own approach to creating mystery and intrigue. All throughout the world you'll find pages of an instruction manual--really does look like one that would've been packaged with a game in the early '90s--that you have to piece together to learn about the world around you. It does a wonderful job replicating the thrill of discovery found in early Zelda games. Tunic is much harder than Zelda games from a combat perspective, but overcoming each challenge feels like a great triumph. Plus, any combat pains you may have are made worthwhile by gorgeous world that is a joy to explore.\n\nWhen it comes to gaming, there's nothing in the rulebook that says a cycling game can't cover topics like the apocalypse and ghosts. Wheel World is a prime example of this, as developer Messhof's delightful tour across a colorful world features multiple elements that mesh together well, like gears on an obscenely priced bicycle. Not only does the cycling feel great, but you're given a chance to pedal your way through gorgeous realms with it, ignite your competitive spirit, and trick it out before you save the world from total ruin.\n\nObsidian Entertainment's The Outer Worlds was introduced as a spiritual sci-fi successor to Fallout, but the studio has successfully crafted an identity for its spacefaring action-RPG. Combat has been polished up, and choices feel more meaningful than ever, but the real hook is in how you approach the game and build your own legend. Whether you're a bumbling adventurer who fails upwards or an operative who wields sharp blades and even sharper wit, it's all up to you to figure out who you want to be in a solar system ripped apart by factional wars and corporate takeovers.\n\nRead our The Outer Worlds 2 review.",

    "description": "Recent genetic studies highlight how Neanderthal DNA contributes to the sensitivity experienced by modern humans, showcasing deep ancestral links",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nDNA study leads researchers to pin humanity’s low pain thresholds on Neanderthals.\n\nThe team believes that, thousands of years ago, interbreeding caused the development of key traits that were then passed down to modern humans.\n\nAs the study of Neanderthals continues, additional traits join the growing list of similarities between the species and modern humans.\n\nNot a big fan of getting shots at the doctor or sitting for tattoos? Your low pain threshold could just be a factor of your genetics, and long-held genetics at that.\n\nResearchers in Europe say they’ve linked the genetics of ancient Neanderthal interbreeding to low thresholds for specific types of pain in modern humans. They published the findings in Communications Biology.\n\n“We have been learning more and more about what we have inherited from [Neanderthals] as a result of interbreeding tens of thousands of years ago,” Kaustubh Adhikari, study co-author and University College London Genetics, Evolution & Environment researcher, said in a statement. “Our findings suggest that Neanderthals may have been more sensitive to certain types of pain, but further research is needed for us to understand why that is the case, and whether these specific genetic variations were evolutionarily advantageous.”\n\nSince the Neanderthal genome was first sequenced 15 years ago, researchers have worked to link modern humans to these archaic ancestors in a variety of ways. So far, scientists have found links from Neanderthal DNA to everything from the shapes of modern noses to our propensity for diseases.\n\nIn the recent study on pain, researchers investigated three variations in the SCN9A gene, and reported greater pain sensitivity among humans carrying all three variants. The SCN9A gene builds sodium channels that help nerve cells communicate—in particular, it helps the cells alert the nervous system to a painful threat from damaged tissue.\n\nAuthors say that the three gene variants were associated with a lower pain threshold for pricking the skin after earlier exposure to mustard oil (which was used to sensitize the area), but were not associated with any changes in tolerance for pain caused by heat or pressure. Carrying all three variants increased pain sensitivity as compared to carrying only one.\n\nThe sodium channel was actually recognized as “crucial” in the scope of pain pathways in 2020 by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany and Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet. They suggested back then that Neanderthals experienced heightened pain sensitivity compared to modern humans, thanks to the SCN9A gene.\n\nBut the earlier study didn’t fully explore the mechanical aspects of the increased pain sensitivity—the prick is more powerful than pressure or heat. This recent study proposes that those holding the three Neanderthal variants have more sensitized sensory neurons, and are therefore able to warn the body of these poke-induced pains.\n\n“We have shown how variation in our genetic code can alter how we perceive pain,” Pierre Faux, first author and researcher at Aix-Marseille University and University of Toulouse, said in a news release, “including genes that modern humans acquired from the Neanderthals.”\n\nThey also found that the three Neanderthal variants are more common in populations with higher percentages of Native American ancestry. The study says that the variants are largely absent in Europeans and common in Latin Americans, thanks to what they call “population bottlenecks that occurred during the initial occupation of the Americas.”\n\nThe team now wants to know if this lower pain threshold offered up any sort of evolutionary benefit, or if increased pain sensitivity when poked is just another piece of Neanderthal history living in modern humans.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

Then he went backstage and met with two rising stars from the steamy hockey romance, \"Heated Rivalry,\" and caused a small meltdown on social media.\n\nConnor Storrie and Hudson Williams were seen in a video posted by MTV saying hello to Hong backstage, then posing for a photo together.\n\n\"Fellow Koreans!\" Williams was heard saying in MTV's video. Williams is half-Korean.\n\nStorrie and Williams were at the Globes to present the award for best female supporting actor in television. The duo is fresh off promotions for their HBO Max smash hit, which, thanks to the power of TikTok, has become one of the most popular releases of 2025 in terms of viewership.\n\nAfter footage of the backstage huddle was posted, X and Instagram were inundated with comments from both fandoms, with people saying they'd \"manifested\" the meeting after Hong's attendance at the awards ceremony was confirmed.\n\nHong said on the red carpet on Sunday that he hadn't seen the show, which is about a torrid love affair between two pro hockey players.\n\n\"A lot of fans have been recommending that to me, so, definitely gonna check it out,\" he said.\n\nThis might not be the last time this year that Hong's fans see him stateside, as he's now working with the California-based United Talent Agency in a bid to secure acting gigs. He's also still on tour with his band members in Seventeen, who hit up Southeast Asia in their next stops.",

He described the move as a part of a broader effort to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nProminent economists and business leaders are reacting as the news hit markets at the start of the trading week. They weighed in on how the DOJ move affects the Fed's independence, a question also raised by Sen. Thom Tillis. On Sunday, the Republican said he would oppose nominees for the Fed.\n\n\"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\n\nHere's what leaders in economics and business are saying:\n\nProminent economist Mohamed El-Erian called for Powell's resignation months ago to protect the Fed's independence amid the feud with Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, El-Erian wrote on X that the inquiry into Powell is damaging for the US central bank.\n\n\"For those of us who value the operational autonomy of central banks, the risk is that this situation could expose deeper issues — further undermining the credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile,\" wrote El-Erian, who is a former co-chief investment officer at Pimco.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman raised concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"Question to all those who said Trump would be better for the economy: is attacking the Fed's independence what you had in mind?\" wrote the prominent Democratic donor on X.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, attributed the gold price surge to fresh record highs on Sunday evening to the investigation into Powell.\n\n\"I am not a fan of Powell, but I agree with him on Trump's motivation,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\nIn April, Schiff said Trump's next Fed Chair pick would be a \"loyal soldier.\"\n\nMichael A. Gayed, a renowned investment manager, said direct action against a sitting Fed Chair is \"without modern precedent,\" in an edition of his Lead-Lag substack report published on Sunday evening.\n\nThe inquiry into Powell raises questions about whether the long-standing boundaries between fiscal power, prosecutorial authority, and monetary independence are beginning to blur, Gayed said. The concern was less about any single case and more about the future precedent it may establish.\n\n\"Should investors conclude that future Fed officials could face legal consequences for policy decisions that conflict with political priorities, the incentive structure governing monetary policy could change,\" said Gayed.\n\nThat shift could increase inflation risk premiums and weaken confidence in long-duration financial assets tied to stable policy expectations, he added.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short,\" says the era of Big Tech turning relatively small investments into huge profits is ending.\n\nIn a recent Substack exchange with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry said the most important metric AI industry investors should be watching isn't revenue growth, hiring, or even market size, but return on invested capital, or ROIC.\n\nROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it puts into its business into profit.\n\n\"The measure to beat all measures is return on invested capital (ROIC), and ROIC was very high at these software companies. Now that they are becoming capital-intensive hardware companies, ROIC is sure to fall, and this will pressure shares in the long run,\" Burry wrote.\n\nAI, Burry said, is pushing companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta away from their historically asset-light software models and toward a far more capital-intensive future defined by data centers, chips, and energy.\n\nEven if AI expands Big Tech's addressable market, he said, falling ROIC could pressure stock prices for years to come.\n\nBurry rose to fame after his bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled in \"The Big Short.\" Outside the occasional cryptic social media post, Burry, for a long time, spoke publicly only rarely.\n\nThat changed late last year when he closed his hedge fund to outside cash and began writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he has recently compared the AI boom to the late-1990s dot-com bubble, calling OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time.\" Netscape's IPO marked the beginning of dot-com hype in 1995. Five years later, the bubble burst.\n\nBurry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, has made large bets against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, two darlings of the AI era, according to a regulatory filing released in September last year.\n\nLeading AI companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, are spending big to build out the infrastructure they need to support their energy- and data-intensive chatbots and other AI applications. Debt and equity investors have lined up to back these projects.\n\nSo far, however, those companies have not shown significant profit returns on their AI products, leading investors like Burry to sound the alarm that AI is a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nAgreed. And still, return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off. Will it be the Panic of 2026? 2027? Does not have to be. https://t.co/VBWjh26vnc\n\n\"At some point, this spending on the AI buildout has to have a return on investment higher than the cost of that investment, or there is just no economic value added,\" Burry wrote in the Substack post.",

Elon Musk says so.\n\nIn earnings calls, podcast interviews, and a steady stream of posts on X, the outspoken CEO has spent the past year teasing a wave of new hardware and software that he says will define Tesla's future.\n\n\"2026 will be something special,\" Musk posted on X on January 1.\n\nTesla's promises for the year fall into four major bets: self-driving software for consumer cars, a fully autonomous robotaxi service, humanoid robots, and showing off at least one long-delayed new vehicle.\n\nAnalysts say the company's future increasingly hinges on just one thing — whether its AI-powered autonomy can work at scale.\n\n\"I think 2026 is going to be the prove-it year for Tesla's robotaxi business,\" Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar who closely watches Tesla, told Business Insider. \"That's ultimately going to be the major driver for Tesla this year.\"\n\nLast June, Tesla Model Ys and Model 3s started carting passengers around Austin, Texas with no humans behind the steering wheel. Instead, the company launched with so-called \"safety drivers\" in the front passenger seat to intervene if needed.\n\nGoldstein said he's watching closely to see where regulators allow Tesla's self-driving vehicles to operate — and whether the company becomes confident enough in its technology to remove safety drivers from the front seats entirely.\n\nRight now, the robotaxis are driving in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta.\n\nDuring the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla's purpose-built autonomous vehicle, known as the Cybercab, would begin volume production in April. The two-passenger vehicle is designed without a steering wheel or brake pedal.\n\n\"That's really a vehicle that's optimized for full autonomy,\" he said on the call. \"I think the demand will be pretty nutty.\"\n\nTesla has also claimed a significant lead over competitors in consumer self-driving data. During the same earnings call, Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of Autopilot and AI software, said customers had driven more than six billion miles using Full Self-Driving in supervised mode.\n\n\"That's a big milestone,\" Elluswamy said. \"Overall, the safety continues to be very good.\"\n\nThose claims come as both legacy automakers and tech companies push deeper into autonomous driving. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nvidia unveiled its new self-driving car platform. Rivian said its $45,000 R2 SUV, launching in early 2026, will include self-driving capabilities. Ford plans to roll out advanced autonomous tech on its 2027 electric pickup, while General Motors is offering point-to-point hands-free driving in its high-end Cadillac Escalade IQ.\n\nMusk has dismissed the competition. In a post on X, he said Tesla was five years ahead of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — in self-driving technology.\n\nTesla is also preparing to reintroduce the second-generation Roadster, a two-door electric sports car first unveiled more than 8 years ago that has been repeatedly delayed. The vehicle is now slated for another unveiling on April Fool's Day.\n\nIn November, Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan that if Peter Thiel wanted a future with flying cars, he should get it. Musk has said the new Roadster is a collaboration with SpaceX and will include rocket technology.\n\n\"It's going to be the most memorable product unveil ever,\" he said, before telling the notorious podcaster that he set the unveil date for April Fools for \"deniability.\"\n\nThe Semi, an electric eighteen-wheeler, is also expected to roll out of Tesla's Nevada factory in the first half of 2026.\n\nEarly production models traversed California's highways with Pepsi and Walmart products in pilot tests.\n\nThen there's Optimus — a major bet for Tesla and one that Musk has said will be \"the biggest product ever.\"\n\nMusk has said the humanoid robots will eventually handle general-purpose tasks like folding laundry, tightening screws, or stirring a pot of pasta.\n\nBut manufacturing Optimus has proved challenging. Musk has said designing its hands, for example, is \"an incredibly difficult engineering challenge.\"\n\nIn a 2024 post on X, he claimed Tesla was aiming for \"high production for other companies\" by 2026, suggesting the robots could one day be manufactured at scale for outside customers.\n\nMusk's recent track record for deadlines has given some investors reason to be cautious of the CEO's projections for the coming year.\n\nMusk is a self-proclaimed optimist when it comes to deadlines and goals, but he does have a history of delivering much of what he promises — eventually.\n\n\"Elon is a visionary,\" Goldstein told Business Insider. \"He's figured out a lot of very difficult problems in the past when other people couldn't — making profitable EVs and reusable rockets — he deserves a lot of credit.\"\n\nBut Goldstein said Tesla's path to automotive dominance is narrowing. As the company has focused heavily on autonomy, other automakers have improved vehicle hardware quickly enough to challenge Tesla's advantage.\n\nThat's particularly true in China, he said.\n\n\"BYD has surpassed Tesla and then gone after a lower price point in key markets in China and Europe,\" he said.\n\nTesla has reported two consecutive years of sales declines, Goldstein added, and \"it's looking like 2026 could be a third.\" Meanwhile, many US automakers are pulling back from EVs and car-buyers can no longer enjoy the $7,500 EV incentive.\n\n\"2026 is going to be a bit of a challenge for Tesla as the EV scene has since dramatically changed, especially with last year's disappearance of any helpful federal tax credits,\" Robby DeGraff, a product and consumer insights manager at AutoPacific, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Subtle, slight refreshes of the Model Y and Model 3 plus reveals of the Cybercab and other innovations like the humanoid robots were newsworthy sure, but the reality is Tesla's lineup is stale and lagging behind much of the competition in terms of design, performance, and features,\" he added.\n\nDespite those risks, many investors remain sold on Musk's vision.\n\nIn mid-December, Tesla shares hit a record high of more than $481. The stock is up about 12% over the last year, including a roughly 50% surge in the past six months.\n\n\"I think the most important thing for Tesla to do right now, especially as we see the EV market slow a bit, is ready and ensure there's a proper entry-level, affordable EV out there for consumers,\" DeGraff added.\n\nDeGraff said the new \"Standard\" versions of the Model 3 and Model Y are \"a good step\" but \"there's more work to be done to bring that pricing down, which still remains a major deterrent for uncertain EV shoppers.\"",

    "title": "Your ex may be stalking you on LinkedIn",
    "description": "LinkedIn is supposed to be a place to find a job. But people are using the social media app to look up exes and screen potential romantic interests.",
    "fullText": "Branda Statman has had some \"scary times\" on LinkedIn. Not scary in terms of worrying about her safety — scary in terms of embarrassment. Statman, a brand manager who lives in Phoenix, has scoped out exes or potential partners on the platform more than once without switching to private browsing mode, forgetting they'd be notified. A couple of guys have called her out on it, which she's been able to spin as due diligence in modern-day dating. A tougher one to explain away: when her mom took a look at a potential suitor's profile a couple of years ago. \"Sometimes, I overshare with my mom,\" Statman, 25, says. When the guy brought it up, she claimed she'd been browsing on her mom's phone for whatever reason. That was, of course, a lie. \"It was totally just my mom looking and stalking,\" she says.\n\nSnooping on an ex or love interest on social media is a tale as old as time — or, rather, as old as Facebook. Plenty of us have been tempted to see what a former fling is up to on Instagram. But most of the time, those platforms don't rat you out (assuming your finger doesn't slip on the like button).\n\nLinkedIn is, in theory, a different animal — a professional space, focused on work, branding, and self-promotion. LinkedIn is for labor, not love. But it's moving into more intimate territory as the lines between the personal and the professional blur, turning a job platform into a place where scorned lovers are lurking. Because LinkedIn ties visibility to opportunity, users are forced to strike a delicate balance between maximizing professional exposure and maintaining personal privacy.\n\nIn recent weeks, I spoke with more than a dozen people about their LinkedIn stalking stories, which ranged from hilarious to harrowing. I heard from one woman who'd accidentally sent their ex-mother-in-law a LinkedIn connection request after a divorce. I spoke with a man who caught his cheating ex checking out his profile on his birthday. One woman noticed an ex from nearly a decade ago leave a nasty comment on one of her posts, joking that he'd \"take the train\" rather than sit next to her on an airplane. Another recalled using LinkedIn in Brooklyn in the 2010s to check if all those Tinder guys who said they worked at Vice actually did.\n\nLuckily for Statman, her story is on the humorous side. The guy her mom looked at ghosted her after a couple of months of dating (not because of the LinkedIn incident). A couple of years later, he texted to apologize for disappearing and told her he was glad to see she was doing well — he'd seen her on LinkedIn. \"It goes both ways sometimes,\" she says.\n\nThey talked about rekindling their short-lived romance. He ghosted again, but he still follows her on LinkedIn.\n\nIt's normal to wonder about figures from the past, and most people are doing their espionage in good fun. But it can be mortifying if someone realizes you're doing some light cybermonitoring, and it's jarring when you catch someone keeping an eye on you. It's hard to move on from a partner when you're still in each other's online faces.\n\nLinkedIn has a freemium model — you can create a profile and access many of its features without charge, but if you want extras, you often have to pony up. At the unpaid level, there's a trade-off: users can see some information about who's looked at their profile, but only if they allow others to see when they've done the same. Higher-tiered versions allow users to browse in incognito mode, meaning people don't see when they've poked around their page. The result is a web of spies and spy-catchers who pay for varying levels of anonymity.\n\nLike many breakups, Dakota Rae Lowe's separation from her recent ex was messy, and the drama spilled out onto LinkedIn, where both have formidable presences. He posted a mirror selfie on the platform, and she, finding it cringy, posted a subtweet about it, saying if she ever did the same, \"please report me.\" Lowe, 30, who works in advertising in New York, still catches her ex \"shamelessly viewing\" her profile, even though they split months ago. \"Can he not afford Premium?\" she says, referring to the paid invisible-browsing tier. \"I pay for Premium, because I'm not going to be embarrassed like that.\"\n\nOthers have had similar experiences. When a short-lived relationship petered out in 2022, Kevin Grunewald, now 40, thought things ended on relatively amicable terms — like a lot of relationships, it didn't quite work. But then the Texas-based recruiter noticed the woman he'd dated was viewing his LinkedIn profile almost daily, \"it was part of her morning ritual, I guess,\" he says. She began liking his posts and messaging him, and he finally had to put his foot down after she popped by his house a few times, \"I think she blocked me,\" he says, \"which I'm kind of happy about.\"\n\nGina Gacad, a 31-year-old communications professional in New York, noticed the mother of her college boyfriend lurking on her profile years after they broke up — and around the time she'd heard he was seeing someone new. \"I just wonder if they were trying to size up the new girlfriend,\" she says. (A running theme in my conversations was that parents are often the problem. Less digitally savvy — and digitally bashful — they're the ones searching without abandon on LinkedIn.)\n\nTo be sure, Gacad isn't above some LinkedIn prowling of her own. Another ex belittled her about her job, and when his employer had layoffs, she went to his LinkedIn to see if he was on the chopping block. \"He was let go, which was unfortunate, but also he was being a dick,\" she says. She's not worried about former paramours returning the favor, either. \"I think when a guy would wrong me, or someone would wrong me, LinkedIn was the place where I would validate myself.\"\n\nThis is a recurring theme among the people I spoke to: Not everyone is taken aback to see someone from the past poking around in their business-related business. Many are proud of their professional accomplishments, and they're happy for others to see them.\n\nFor some people, LinkedIn lurking doesn't just feel awkward or validating — it feels threatening. People often share a lot of specific information about themselves on LinkedIn, including their location and workplace. LinkedIn comes with a privacy tax that some people may not want to pay. At the same time, being invisible may come with another tax — lost job opportunities.\n\nSoon after she moved to Spain in 2023, Amanda Brooks, 30, met a guy on Hinge whom she quickly realized wasn't right for her. She blocked him on social media after he wouldn't take no for an answer to his request for a second date. A year later, he followed her on LinkedIn and began liking her posts and regularly checking her profile. So she blocked him there, too. \"Crazy stuff,\" she says. She's not super worried about the man anymore, but it has made her rethink her approach to the internet, including LinkedIn. \"You can kind of get comfortable,\" she says.\n\nRT, whom I agreed to grant anonymity for this story to protect her privacy, can't seem to shake her former partner's shadow. They ended things in 2020, after which he haunted her for a year, including waiting outside her home and confronting her father at his workplace. He also threatened to call her employer and have her fired for smoking marijuana. RT, who is in her 30s, is now happily married and lives abroad, but a couple of months ago, she noticed her ex's father was looking at her LinkedIn profile. \"His dad is retired, so there's not really a reason for him to be on there,\" she says.\n\nShe's blocked her ex everywhere, lives thousands of miles away, and still, the concern about what he might see holds her back, which is especially detrimental given that she's a corporate recruiter. \"It does have me kind of wary of posting on there,\" she says. \"Who knows what other family members might try to look? Or other people he might know?\"\n\nDA, who I also granted anonymity, echoes the sentiment. She's currently on the job market and wonders if limiting the information on her LinkedIn profile to avoid an ex's surveillance will hurt her prospects. \"There's this huge push for people to be LinkedIn influencers and everything to be noticed by employers, and that's been really hard for me,\" she says. \"It's not like I'm afraid of being judged for putting myself out there, I'm afraid of being stalked and this guy having too much information.\"\n\nLinkedIn declined to comment for this story.\n\nIf you're a LinkedIn user, you may have noticed that LinkedIn is weird now. Gone are the days when its main purpose was to prove to prospective employers that you were not lying on your résumé. Now, everyone's supposed to be some sort of #Linkedinfluencer — there's a nudge for people to be not just users but creators. It fosters a sense that if you're not shouting about your most minuscule work wins from the rooftops, you're failing.\n\nIt's a tough spot: When the working world expects so much exposure, especially in a labor market as stagnant as this, where do you draw the line? There's no good way to explain to your boss — let alone your potential boss — that you'd rather not be posting front-facing videos on LinkedIn because some woman you went out with a decade ago keeps liking them.\n\n\"We've all been socialized to think that putting yourself out there is a route to potential success and career windfall, but at the same time, putting yourself out there opens you up to risks of hyper visibility,\" says Brooke Erin Duffy, a social media researcher and associate professor at Cornell University.\n\nRosanna Bellini, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at NYU who researches how technology impacts stalking and intimate partner violence, says that on many social media platforms, such as Instagram, users tend to be quite well-versed in their visibility and privacy settings. They can close direct messages, set their profiles to private, and so on. With LinkedIn, it's more complicated.\n\n\"What's really unusual about LinkedIn is that you don't have these fine-grained elements of control,\" she says.\n\nWhat's more, it's seen as a \"bit of a faux pas\" if you leave off specific information from your LinkedIn, Bellini says. \"On LinkedIn, everything's pretty location-based,\" she says. Recruiters want to know where people are, and employers increasingly want to ensure they can come into the office. \"There's an enormous amount of pressure on individuals to be as visible as they possibly can to be recruitable,\" meaning any missing piece of information directly affects employability.\n\nIt probably goes without saying that looking up your ex, whether on social media or not, is often not a great idea. Research shows that keeping tabs on a former partner post-breakup heightens distress, increases jealousy, and hinders recovery. Looking up the former lovers of your current partner is bad for you, too. And if the person doing the snooping is currently in a relationship — which was the case with many of the people I spoke with — that's a red flag.\n\nJaime Bronstein, a licensed clinical social worker and relationship therapist, tells me a lot of it boils down to intent. \"If you're going to do a reachout, it's just a way to gather some information in an innocent way,\" she says. If you're in a relationship but find yourself checking in on old flames, it may be time to \"start asking yourself questions about are you happy?\" After all, it's a little strange to be LinkedIning your high school girlfriend with your wife in the other room. And if the other person ended things or cut contact, \"no message is a message,\" she says.\n\nFor some, the possibility of an emotional setback is enough to keep them away. Holly Benjamin, a 32-year-old marketer from Boston, recently considered looking up an ex from over a decade ago on LinkedIn. Things ended poorly — with a restraining order — and she's worried that if she does take a look and he looks in return, it could send her into a \"yearlong spiral.\" \"It's so natural to be curious about where people ended up, but LinkedIn is the only platform where that curiosity can feel a little risky,\" she says. \"A neutral action becomes something that has a lot more thought behind it.\"\n\nNot all LinkedIn former lover stakeouts have a bad ending — indeed, it can be quite the opposite. That's what happened to Lisette Hall, a 42-year-old marketer in Chicago. In 2023, a man she'd known from high school added her on LinkedIn; they hadn't spoken in 20 years. When she brought it up to friends, some of them told her to ignore it. It was an unusual move, after all, and he hadn't sent a message. But she went ahead and accepted the request, since they'd had crushes on each other way back when. After that, they got to chatting. They're now married.\n\nShe points out that he could have just Googled her, especially since she has a website where he could have contacted her. He thought LinkedIn would be the least creepy avenue.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Louise Allen played in all four Grand Slam tournaments, finishing third at Wimbledon in 1983. She's now the CPO at Planview in Austin.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Louise Allen, the chief product officer at Planview, who's in her 60s and is based in Austin. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the chief product officer at Planview, an AI-driven portfolio management platform. Planview helps people organize and manage their workloads by providing teams with visibility into tasks in progress, who's responsible, and how everything connects.\n\nI've been the CPO since June 2021. I spent 13 years as the company's senior vice president of product management and solutions marketing.\n\nBefore entering the tech industry, I was a professional tennis player for 11 years.\n\nI was a decorated athlete and fortunate to have played in all four Grand Slam tournaments, finishing third at Wimbledon in 1983. I'd ranked 60th in the world and trained alongside some of the fiercest competitors the sport has ever seen. I earned six figures in prize money throughout my career.\n\nI'd also faced significant obstacles — most notably, back-to-back ACL injuries, which put me on medical rest for the better part of two years.\n\nAfter just over a decade of intense training, global travel, and high-stakes competition, I knew my time on the circuit had to end. I couldn't tell you why, exactly; I just felt called to try something new.\n\nTech offered me the opportunity to challenge myself and use the skills I'd honed on the court: Vision, planning, adaptation, and relentless commitment to improvement. I was excited by the pace of innovation, the potential to create something new, and the opportunity to solve real problems.\n\nWhen I hung up my racket, I returned to school and earned my MBA at 34. My first role in tech was secured thanks to a reference from Billie Jean King, which helped me land a product marketing internship at a small startup.\n\nThe hardest part of starting a corporate job was my schedule not being my own — working hard and learning were all pretty natural to me, but starting at the bottom of the totem pole and having a lot of my time directed by others was a big adjustment.\n\nI was relatively late to making a career change into tech by most professional standards, but I had come to tennis relatively late, too, and that never stopped me.\n\nIt was a much smaller company back then, with just one product line. Product management was just getting started, and I was able to get in on the ground floor of that.\n\nAs the company grew and evolved, so did my role. I moved from tactical roles to more strategic leadership.\n\nToday, Planview is a very different company with broader offerings and a transformed value proposition. I'm in more C-level conversations in a week than I used to have in a year.\n\nI see hyping up teams as a key part of the role; it's what gets everyone excited about and aligned with the overall vision. People need to walk away being fired up about what we do, and my days are often filled with high-level conversations across teams, customers, and other C-suite leaders.\n\nA typical day includes strategy meetings, product road map reviews, and customer-facing discussions, both in-person and virtual. All of these conversations are focused on steering the ship in the right direction.\n\nI've also learned to become more selfish with my time as I've risen in the company. Putting in 12-hour days just isn't what I want to be doing at this point in my career, and I don't want my teams to feel like they need to, either.\n\nMaintaining the flexibility of a hybrid schedule is a priority for us at Planview, which we prioritize across our teams. I try to lead by example, modeling the work-life balance that's so critical to preventing burnout and maintaining productivity and creativity.\n\nAs for older professionals, I'd like to emphasize that businesses do — really — see a lot of value in curating intergenerational teams. With age comes historical knowledge and insight into why certain processes are structured as they are; with youth, fresh eyes, ideas, and insights.\n\nTake it one step at a time, and through the route that feels right to you. That might mean taking an internship or contract role, joining a professional network in your field of interest, or finding a mentor who can vouch for you, as Billie Jean King did for me.\n\nIt's also critical to focus on your skills rather than your work history. All of your experiences, no matter how unrelated they may seem, can add value. Many of the more technical or field-specific details can be taught, but core capabilities such as relationship-building, time management, presentation and communication skills, and teamwork are more challenging to learn.\n\nTennis taught me risk management, strategic planning, and resilience, all of which I use every day in my work. Those soft skills are often what set you apart, especially in leadership.",

    "title": "We asked over 150 software engineers about vibe-coding. Here's what they said.",
    "description": "167 software engineers responded to Business Insider's vibe-coding survey. Over 45% reported \"keeping up\" with AI tools. Almost 17% feel behind.",
    "fullText": "AI has radically changed what coding looks like. We asked software engineers how they felt about it.\n\nAndrej Karpathy coined the term \"vibe-coding,\" or the creation of code using AI. The term has since gained traction among developers worldwide and was named Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025.\n\nLess than a year after his post, Karpathy wrote that he had \"never felt this much behind as a programmer.\"\n\nWe asked developers: When it comes to vibe-coding, do you feel ahead, behind, or like you're keeping pace?\n\n167 software engineers responded to our survey. The biggest cohort — 75 engineers, or 46.9% — said that they were \"keeping up.\" 30 engineers said they felt ahead of the curve, while 27 felt behind.\n\n28 engineers (or 17.5% of respondents) said that they were opting out of using AI code editing tools entirely. These engineers wrote that the tools weren't advanced enough, or that they took too long to learn how to use. None of the 28 agreed to speak on the record after Business Insider reached out.\n\nWhile the survey isn't scientific, the results offer insight into how software engineers are feeling about their rapidly changing industry.\n\nIn follow-up conversations, eight engineers told Business Insider how they feel about AI code editors. All found them helpful in some form, though their usages ranged from one-off tools to lifesavers.\n\nRyan Shah sometimes wonders: \"Did I really need to learn how to write code?\"\n\nThe 23-year-old AI consultant from Atlanta recently graduated with a degree in computer information technology. Now he uses Cursor and Google's Antigravity, paired with Claude Opus 4.5, which he said was at \"midlevel engineer status.\"\n\nShah said he doesn't regret his software engineering courses, though. They taught him to \"read\" code, he said, a skill that, coupled with his vibe-coding proficiencies, keeps him from being \"the first one laid off.\"\n\nJavanie Campbell swung the other way: He warned that over-reliance on vibe-coding tools will put your career in danger.\n\n\"For people who turn to the LLM as the God or the expert, they will be replaced,\" said the 35-year-old CEO of DevDaysAtWork, who is based in Jamaica.\n\nAmong software engineers, there's a debate brewing: Just how bad will the effects of AI code editors be on jobs? Some say they will shrink the industry's workforce; others call them tools, not replacements for engineers.\n\nThe first time Ryan Clinton tried vibe-coding, he got scared for his job. He's not fearful anymore, he said.\n\nClinton's engineering level won't be affected, said the 46-year-old software developer from Nashville. More experienced engineers work on \"architecture and design,\" he said, while more junior staffers code. At this point of AI coding, human intervention is also still routinely necessary.\n\n\"You want to make sure it makes sense,\" he said. \"Only an idiot would randomly click 'yes' and commit it.\"\n\nBarry Fruitman is more worried — but not for himself. At 56, the Android developer from Toronto doesn't think the job market will feel the effect until five to 10 years out.\n\n\"Today, I think the threat is overstated, and hopefully it will stay that way until I retire,\" he said.\n\nEd Gaile said AI tools have doubled, if not tripled, his productivity.\n\nThe 55-year-old Appfire principal solutions architect from Atlanta was impressed by the decrease in context switching that vibe-coding tools brought.\n\n\"I wish I had this 15 years ago,\" he said.\n\nFor AI code editors, the word \"productivity\" still looms large. Many people feel that they're saving time by using these tools. Others cite the additional time spent reviewing and correcting lines of code.\n\nA July METR study added fuel to the fire.\n\nThe study asked experienced developers to complete a series of tasks. Study participants working without AI's help spent 10% more time coding — but those with AI assistance spent 20% more time reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI, waiting on AI, or being idle. Ultimately, the study found that the AI-assisted developers were less productive.\n\nShawn Gay, a 54-year-old R&D manager from El Paso, Texas, spends time keeping up with the industry's changes. He said he felt behind the curve.\n\n\"I have decades of experience, so I feel like it's a huge effort to try to change the way my brain thinks about software,\" Gay told Business Insider.\n\nGus De Souza said that he saved time on coding, but spent more time reviewing the AI-generated code. The real productivity gains were in troubleshooting, said the 48-year-old software architect from Kitchener, Ontario.\n\nWhat even is a vibe-coder? While the term has grown to encompass most forms of AI-assisted coding, Karpathy's X post first defined it as when developers \"fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.\"\n\nLara Fraser, a data analyst and epidemiologist from Sarasota, Florida, doesn't consider herself a vibe-coder.\n\nFraser codes in R and uses tools like ChatGPT and Claude to assist. She's tried other tools, but found high rates of hallucination. The model generation also matters, Fraser said: GPT 5.1 was great, but 5.2 was a \"disaster.\"\n\nFor Fraser, vibe-coding depends on the programmer's skill. Anyone can create an app, but not everyone can maintain it.\n\n\"Inevitably, something's going to break,\" she said. \"Can you fix it? If you can't, you're a vibe-coder.\"",

    "description": "Miles Guo was convicted of fraud. Now his formerly luxurious lifestyle is being broken down and sold for parts in bankruptcy court.",
    "fullText": "Miles Guo's home these days is a federal jail in Brooklyn. His life was once dizzyingly more fabulous.\n\nThe fraud-convicted one-time billionaire sailed on a gleaming superyacht, wore custom-tailored Brioni suits, and strode through his Gilded Age mansion on a million-dollar cushion of Chinese and Persian carpets.\n\nSince 2022, the cash, homes, luxury cars, and private jets of Guo's suptuous former life have been picked over by prosecutors, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a federal bankruptcy trustee — all trying to claw back money for thousands of creditors and victims in one of the most sprawling fraud cases in recent history.\n\nGuo — aka Ho Wan Kwok and Guo Wengui — lived so lavishly that the liquidation process has taken three years and counting.\n\nHere's a look at some of the priciest assets that, piece by extravagant piece, are being sold off as part of Guo's ongoing 2022 federal bankruptcy case.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Guo starred in Mandarin-language music videos and livestreams that enticed victims from around the world into investing $1.3 billion in his various anti-China and cryptocurrency schemes.\n\nMany of the videos show him in his 15-room Manhattan penthouse, gazing triumphantly at the city from either of two terraces overlooking Central Park.\n\nThe 7,000-square-foot home occupies the entirety of the 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue, and is now being sold off as part of the bankruptcy.\n\nBrokers at Compass are asking $12 million — far less than the $67.5 million Guo paid for it in 2015, shortly upon his arrival from China on the heels of a corruption investigation there.\n\nIt was here that Guo was arrested by federal agents in 2023.\n\nConvicted in Manhattan of federal racketeering conspiracy in 2024, Guo's sentencing and a final ruling on forfeiture have been delayed five times, in part due to the complexity of his finances.\n\nGuo's Greenwich, Connecticut, mansion was sold for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate in 2024 for $7.2 million.\n\nThe 21-room, seven-bedroom home, which Guo bought for $4.6 million in 2020, borders the Stanwich Club golf course. Real estate listings feature tennis courts, an in-ground pool, a six-car garage, a billiards room, a gym, and a movie theater. Well-trimmed ivy climbs the stone and wood-shingled exterior.\n\nFederal prosecutors say the home featured bulletproof glass and that Guo employed round-the-clock security in the three years he lived there.\n\nLocated 25 miles from New York City in Mahwah, New Jersey, the historic Crocker-McMillin mansion is the last and most elaborate of the three addresses Guo purchased and then lost control of in the ongoing bankruptcy litigation.\n\nThe home's ceiling murals, elaborately carved railings, and other Gilded Age vestiges can be seen in real estate listings; brokers at Compass are asking $19 million.\n\nAccording to court filings and other online records, Guo bought the 21-bedroom estate for $26 million in 2022.\n\nHe was in the midst of spending another $18 million renovating and furnishing the Jacobean-styled home — built in 1907 by railroad heir George Crocker and modeled after England's Bramshill House — when he was arrested.\n\nGuo's plans included outfitting separate wings for his wife, his son, and his daughter. Federal prosecutors say he'd already purchased $978,000 in carpets, a $62,000, eight-foot-diameter Samsung television, and something his indictment called a $53,000 \"Louis XV-style gilt bronze fireplace log cradle.\"\n\nThe filings don't say if Guo intended to keep the mansion's floor-to-ceiling pipe organ, which likely came in handy during the seven decades the home was a Catholic seminary.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Guo's Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet — a seven-seater he'd purchased in 2019 — was sold back to Cirrus as part of the bankruptcy, for $3.5 million. A second private jet, a Bombardier Global XRS, netted some $12 million.\n\nThe estate has yet to sell Guo's third and last personal aircraft, a four-seat Cirrus SR22 single-engine propeller plane.\n\nGuo's ground-transportation options were also lavish, including a dozen top-end motorcycles and luxury cars, also being litigated for sale in the bankruptcy.\n\nA Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Roadster was seized by the feds from the six-car garage at the Connecticut mansion. And his videos still show him tooling around in his $3.5 million red Ferrari.\n\nThe most expensive of the cars is a $4.4 million custom Bugatti Chiron Super Sport.\n\nGuo's motor yacht, the Lady May, was the first big-ticket item to go on the auction block — in all her shimmering aluminum, white marble, and Macassar ebony glory.\n\nHe spent 41 million euros in fraud proceeds (worth $48 million today) to buy the vessel in 2018. The bankruptcy trustee recovered half that sum — $23 million — three summers ago, selling it, according to bankruptcy filings, to New England auto dealership magnate Herb Chambers.\n\nThe boat boasts five staterooms that can sleep 10 guests, including an owner's cabin with a spacious dressing room and his-and-hers en-suite bathrooms.\n\nGuo's pal and business partner, Steve Bannon, was infamously arrested on board in August 2020.\n\nYacht lovers who missed the 2023 bankruptcy sale have another chance to own it. Now refurbished, renamed \"Excellence V,\" and docked in Fort Lauderdale, the Lady May is listed for sale by yacht brokers Edmiston & Company for $29 million.\n\nGuo's videos, still online, show him stalking the yacht's bleached teak decks as he smokes cigars, raps in Mandarin about his wealth, and aims martial arts kicks at the camera.\n\nIn June, a hodge-podge of furniture, light fixtures, wall hangings, tableware, and knickknacks — 156 items, all from the Manhattan penthouse — were put on the virtual auction block in Connecticut.\n\nThe sale included an ornate mahogany chest of drawers that had been cryptically referred to in Guo's criminal file as \"A Louis XV Style French Ormolu-Mounted Mahogany Commode by Joseph Emmanuel Zweiner.\" \"Veneer damage\" and \"right and left side cracking,\" the auction listing read.\n\nA collection of six small ceramic figurines was listed together as \"Misc. Oriental Items\" and included a \"Damaged & Broken Pig.\" Even a \"Lot of (2) small trash cans\" was up for bidding.\n\nThe bankruptcy file sheds no light on the fate of the racks of hand-tailored Italian suits Guo spoke of while sitting in the library of his penthouse during a 2018 interview with the New York Post.\n\n\"I have 60 custom-made Brioni suits and handmade Louis Vuitton shoes,\" he told the tabloid, which said he added, \"I don't care about things. I'm a Buddhist.\"",

    "description": "Venezuela is home to the world’s largest reported oil reserves. The country’s other commodities have also caught the Trump administration’s attention.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says US companies will now have access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. But the country’s other commodities have also caught his administration’s attention.\n\nVenezuela has unverified amounts of minerals, metals and potentially rare earth elements, experts say. These raw materials are indispensable for industries from defense to technology, and the administration has repeatedly stressed their importance for US national security.\n\nBut while Washington might aspire to secure Venezuela’s critical elements, it’s a tall order, experts say, and wouldn’t do much to bolster America’s supply chain.\n\nThe quantity and economic viability of Venezuela’s mineral resources are uncertain. Companies also face major risks mining in Venezuela without sustained security guarantees.\n\nMany of these regions have guerrilla soldiers and armed groups engaging in illegal gold mining, experts say. Energy-intensive rare earths mining can also harm the environment.\n\n“There is an awareness within the administration that even beyond oil, there’s wider natural resource value in the country,” said Reed Blakemore, director of research at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.\n\n“However, if we’re talking about the conditions under which we are able to exploit those mineral resources and bring them to market, it’s a much more challenging story,” Blakemore said. “And even, frankly, more challenging than the oil story.”\n\nEven if US companies were to try to mine Venezuela’s rare earths, getting them out of the ground is just one part of the process. Those materials are usually sent to China for refining.\n\nChina accounted for over 90% of global rare earths refining in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. The country maintains a virtual monopoly in processing and refining the materials due to decades of government subsidies, industry expansion and lax environmental regulations.\n\nRare earths have become a major sticking point in US-China trade tensions. Beijing last year implemented some export controls on rare earths during trade spats, raising concerns about America’s lack of secure supply chains for these critical materials.\n\n“China still holds near-singular capacity to process rare earth metals, and that industrial and geopolitical edge cannot be overcome overnight,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n\nThe US Geological Survey designates 60 “critical minerals” vital to economic and national security.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures, prompting behind-the-scenes opposition from giants like Apple and Samsung.\n\nThe tech companies ​have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, ‌lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.\n\nThe plan is part of Prime Minister Narendra ‌Modi's efforts to boost security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world's second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.\n\nIT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

    "title": "I'm a CEO who built a fantasy board of directors with AI versions of leaders like Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett",
    "description": "A tech CEO put together a dream board of directors with AI representing famous leaders. Here's how he uses it.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Matt Blumberg, a four-time technology CEO who now leads Markup AI, maker of an AI platform designed to help brands safely scale AI-generated content. He is based in New York City. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSince I run an AI company, I try to build AI agents and use AI as much as I can. In October, I got an idea to build what I call a fantasy board of directors from another CEO, and with his permission, I made a version of my own to use as a personal thought partner.\n\nWe have an actual human board, and it's fantastic. I get really good advice from them. But I wanted to use AI to create a fantasy board because mine is limited by the five people who are on it and the experiences that they have in life.\n\nSo the first thing my executive team and I did was create a fantasy draft. It's a bit of a play on fantasy football and fantasy basketball. But instead of it being a competitive thing, where each of us would draft our own teams, we drafted just one together.\n\nWe started by making a spreadsheet of essentially famous people, largely but not entirely, from the business world. We divided them into categories, including iconic business leaders, tech CEOs, VCs, authors, and thought leaders. We also had a category for different voices, such as Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.\n\nNext, we had something like a draft where we picked a couple of people from each category that we wanted on the board. We settled on about 15 names, including Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThere are also two people on it that I know. One is me. The other is Fred Wilson, a VC I've worked with for the past 25 years at other companies.\n\nFrom here, we had AI build 5,000-word profiles for each person, and we gave the AI a certain template to follow. We wanted the fantasy board members to be able to react to things as real board members would, with actual things they've said about how companies and boards perform.\n\nNext, we built the agent. We loaded all these profiles in and then wrote a really long instruction set about what we were trying to accomplish and what our company does. We also loaded materials from past board meetings, our quarterly business review decks, and other things that real board members would have at their disposal or in their heads.\n\nAll of this took maybe an hour or two.\n\nSo now the fantasy board exists, and I use it as a thought partner. For example, I will provide a draft of a board book before sending it to my actual board, and I'll say: These are materials for an upcoming meeting. What do you think of them? Are there topics you would have expected me to cover that I didn't? What questions am I likely to get back from our board? In return, I'll get really useful commentary.\n\nOne thing we put in the instruction set is that when I ask the board for its opinion, very generically, I want it to tell me the consensus opinion and notable outlying dissent with quotes of things that the fantasy board members have actually said.\n\nI'll also ask it for help with internal projects. I'll say things like: Hey, I'm doing a presentation for our kickoff meeting next week. What do you think are the top three themes I should hit?\n\nRecently, I asked my fantasy board to give me a performance review for 2025. It nailed it. The board called out the things that I would have said are my strengths and things that I would have said are problems. I sent the review to my executive team just as an FYI, and they all came back to me and said it was pretty impressive.\n\nI don't use the fantasy board every day, but I'm probably using it at least every other week for something. There are two big limitations. \n\nOne is that anything agentic is only as good as its inputs. My fantasy board only knows what I've told it about my business, or what's publicly available. It doesn't actually know what happens every day in the company. Even though I'm pretty good about feeding it information, it just doesn't have all the context.\n\nThe other limitation is that they're not real people. When you have a real board of directors, you have a real thought partner as a strategic advisor. If you have a board meeting, people are in a room together. They have body language. They have facial expressions. You can tell when they lean in, when they lean back. You can tell when they roll their eyes because they don't believe something you said. You can call them out on that.\n\nWith any AI agents, you need to be really careful not to believe the bullshit. They're predictive, and they're good, but not perfect. They're not human, and they miss a lot of cues.\n\nI told my real board about my fantasy board at our last meeting, which was in November, right after we built it. I explained what it was and how I've been using it. They thought it was great. A couple of them asked me afterward how I built it. They asked for a road map and said that they'd like to do something like it.\n\nThey viewed the fantasy board the same way I do, which is that it's a nice add-on, a sort of augmentation of thought partnership, but that it's never going to be a substitute for a real board.",

    "description": "McKinsey & Company CEO Bob Sternfels says he wants every employee working alongside an AI agent within a year and a half.",
    "fullText": "Here's a case interview question for you: If a 40,000-person consulting firm added 25,000 AI agents to its workforce in under two years, how would that change its competitive advantage?\n\nIt may not be long before McKinsey & Company is asking job candidates such a case question — but first, the firm is answering it for itself.\n\nThe firm's CEO, Bob Sternfels, said on an episode of Harvard Business Review's IdeaCast recently that the company is rapidly remaking itself around artificial intelligence.\n\nHe said that, according to his latest tally, the firm now has a workforce of 60,000, which he said is made up of 40,000 humans and 20,000 agents.\n\nSpeaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, he said the number of AI agents McKinsey uses is actually closer to 25,000. A McKinsey spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that this figure is the most accurate.\n\nSternfels said on the podcast that just a year and a half ago, the company only used a few thousand agents and hopes that in the next year and a half, every employee will be \"enabled by at least one or more agents.\"\n\nAI agents are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nThe rapid agent rollout at McKinsey reflects a broader industry push to embed generative AI into several facets of a consultant's daily work.\n\nFirms from Boston Consulting Group to PwC are shifting from slide decks and advisory work to multi-year AI-driven transformation projects, and adding a slate of new tools to turbocharge their efficiency.\n\nQuantumBlack, with its 1,700-person team, drives all of McKinsey's AI initiatives, which now account for 40% of the firm's work, Alex Singla, a senior partner at McKinsey who co-leads QuantumBlack, told Business Insider.\n\nAs part of that effort, Singla said the firm is seeking a more dynamic set of candidates who can move between traditional consulting work and an engineering mindset — and can work alongside AI.\n\n\"What we want to be able to do is find those people that actually have a propensity to either be this great McKinsey consultant, and/or a great technologist, and then groom them to be both,\" he said.\n\nThe same is true at Boston Consulting Group, which now has a team of \"forward-deployed consultants\" who are vibe-coding and building AI tools for client projects.\n\nSternfels said AI is reshaping more than its workforce — it is also changing McKinsey's business model.\n\nThe firm is transitioning from its traditional advisory work and classic fee-for-service approach. Instead, McKinsey is moving toward a model where it works with clients to identify joint business cases and then helps them underwrite the outcomes of that business case.",

    "fullText": "Pop quiz: The airline industry is an example of what market structure?\n\nIf you answered oligopoly — in which an industry is dominated by a few powerful firms — you'd score a point on the capitalism test that David Ring gives his 12th-grade high school students in Texas.\n\nRing teaches his economics and government courses in accordance with the state's social studies standards, which include an emphasis on capitalism and its impact on the American economy. Like most of the 10 teachers who spoke to Business Insider about teaching capitalism to high school students, Ring said that as young people increasingly get news and information from social media, the topic has become more politicized. Teachers must walk a fine line to avoid politics while also applying lessons to the real world.\n\n\"I've always tried to present the topics as unbiased as I can while being honest with them about certain realities,\" Ring said. \"If they can walk away from my class not knowing how I vote or what my personal beliefs are or even what religion I am, I think I've done my job.\"\n\nTeachers across the US said their curriculum on capitalism has evolved as students become more aware of economic conditions with the rise of digital media and social platforms — or in their own experience. While that helps stimulate engagement in the topic, it can come with a political bend or misinformation. To fill students' knowledge gaps, teachers are leaning into innovative strategies, like games and real-world entrepreneurship.\n\nSince 2022, 12 states have instituted requirements for high schools to teach financial literacy, some of which include teaching the fundamentals of free-market capitalism. Defined as a system in which private entities own resources and compete for profit, capitalism stands in contrast to models such as socialism, in which the government has a stronger role in wealth redistribution, and communism, which abolishes private ownership in favor of shared resources doled out by the government.\n\nIn recent years, Americans of all ages' positive views about capitalism have declined, according to a range of surveys. The shift is particularly pronounced among younger generations and Democrats, and helps explain the rise in support for political candidates affiliated with the Democratic Socialists, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zohran Mamdani in New York, and Katie Wilson in Seattle.\n\nIn the classroom, students' increased awareness of concepts like how parents' economic status can affect their children's outcomes can be helpful, Ring said, and also a challenge.\n\n\"I think this generation is a lot smarter than people give them credit for,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, teachers like Ring feel responsible for addressing and correcting misconceptions, especially those related to politically charged ideas. For example, students may think they understand the meaning of terms like \"capitalism\" and \"communism\" and have strong feelings about both. However, Ring said that the reality of the US economy is more complex, so his goal is to ensure his students understand the basic market structures and how they translate to the real world.\n\n\"There's no purely free-market driven large-scale economy out there, just as there's no purely communist driven large-scale economy out there,\" Ring said. \"There are certain things that the education code expects them to learn or to understand, but those might just not be how things actually work in the real world.\"\n\nThe majority of Americans still support capitalism, but the view is on the decline: a September Gallup poll found that 54% of respondents said they hold a favorable view of capitalism, down from 60% in 2021 and the lowest percentage Gallup has measured to date. The decline is even more pronounced among Gen Z and millennials, with 39% of 18- to 29-year-olds supporting capitalism, per the latest Harvard Youth Poll, down from 45% in 2020.\n\nWhen Business Insider asked readers to share their views on capitalism in an informal survey, 55% said economic opportunity in the US is unfair or very unfair, and 42% rated their ability to improve their financial situation through hard work alone as low or very low.\n\nDespite the souring sentiment toward capitalism, more states want the economic system to be taught in classrooms, and the shifting state standards can make it difficult to plan an effective curriculum. That's why the University of Virginia's Democracy and Capitalism Lab established an institute two years ago, providing high school social studies teachers with tools to teach about democracy and capitalism in the classroom and helping them better understand free market principles.\n\n\"This is a very pressing topic at the moment, democracy and capitalism, especially with everything that's going on in the world,\" Jennifer Seiter, the education and outreach specialist for the lab, said. \"And yes, it is important for teachers to teach these things, but when they're being handed new classes and new topics without a lot of support, that is where they're searching for help.\"\n\nCurrent events play a significant role in helping prepare teachers to deliver comprehensive lessons on capitalism, Scott Miller, director of the lab, added. He raised the example of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Instead of outright saying that the tariffs are good or bad for the economy, he had the teachers at the institute compare the current policy to Alexander Hamilton's tariff policy. Doing so would help them better understand the historical context of capitalism while connecting it to the modern era.\n\n\"When you're talking about pedagogical issues, framing them and getting a comparative element tends to be much more effective than just being like, taxes are bad, tariffs are bad,\" Miller said.\n\nBonnie Monteleone, an Ohio high school social studies teacher, said that the biggest difference she's noticed over her 30 years of teaching is the rise of social media, and that students are \"being fed stories that an algorithm has decided they want to hear.\"\n\n\"You have kids who are taking things from podcasters, social influencers,\" Monteleone said. \"And as a teacher, it's a challenge because sometimes you're not sure where they're coming from with how they're interpreting their current events and the world around them.\"\n\nOhio State Sen. Steve Wilson, who sponsored a 2024 law requiring high school classrooms to incorporate free market capitalism into financial literacy courses, told Business Insider that he's not a \"capitalism or nothing\" conservative. He doesn't mind if classrooms are teaching about socialism or communism, too.\n\n\"The reality is that we are a capitalistic economy,\" Wilson said. \"And if we're going to teach kids that are going to come out of high school and enter the world how to function in a capitalistic economy, then it's got to be part of financial literacy.\"\n\nHe added that if the economic system of the US were socialism, he would push for socialism to be taught in classrooms.\n\n\"You have to teach whatever your financial system is. And in the United States today, whether people like it or not, capitalism is what you have to understand if you're going to be successful,\" Wilson said.\n\nChristina Elson, executive director of the Center for the Study of Capitalism at Wake Forest University, said that as young people learn about inequality, they become increasingly interested in how capitalism can work better for more Americans. Elson coauthored a 2023 study that found that millennials and Gen Z have shown more dissatisfaction with capitalism than Gen X and boomers. It's because \"the experiential component of their upbringing is very different,\" Elson said.\n\n\"They do not get married at the same age as older generations. They do not develop the same financial or emotional independence that older generations did at the same rate from their parents or their families,\" Elson said, and those factors influence how younger generations view their roles in the economy and how the economy works.\n\nPressure to teach to state standards doesn't apply as much to Robyn Iler, a government teacher at a private Christian school in Virginia. Still, she said she feels a responsibility to ensure her students are aware of the dominant economic system in the US.\n\n\"I think there are some concepts and truths from the Bible that fit in with capitalism, but what, more importantly, fits in with human nature? What do we know is true about humans and how we make decisions?\" Iler said.\n\nShe presents her students with various economic policy ideas — such as plans to raise taxes on the wealthy — and asks them if they think that's the best way to better society. Through those conversations, Iler said she has seen her students develop a growing interest in socialism, driven by their belief that it would promote greater equality.\n\nWhen Eugene Mach started teaching high school business classes about 11 years ago in Northeast Ohio, he taught traditional curricula, such as office skills management. However, he said he felt it didn't meet the needs of his students, who came from a lower-income district. He wanted to focus on ways his students could make more money, so he revamped his curriculum to be entrepreneurship-based.\n\n\"I wanted them to be able to start a business or a side hustle,\" Mach said.\n\nHe works with his students to create a business plan and conduct market research with the goal of running a successful business by the end of the year. He said he has helped students graduate from high school with their own businesses, ranging from hair and makeup services to landscaping. Mach recalled a student who, while living in public housing with his mom and siblings, worked at McDonald's. Through the school's entrepreneurship class, the student started an LLC with his mom, bought a duplex, and graduated as a landlord.\n\nMach said that it's important to teach capitalism in his classroom because it's an economic system that provides the most opportunity for his students. His class focuses on the question of, \"What is it that we can do to make our own situations better and grow our businesses?\"\n\nIn North Carolina, Elizabeth Mosley said that after teaching civics for about a decade, she's noticed that her students are growing increasingly skeptical of capitalism and \"they don't quite buy\" that it should be the first choice for a democracy because of what they see as a focus on profits and wealth building over citizens' well-being.\n\n\"They're very intrigued with the notion of a more equitable economic system,\" Mosley said, adding that she's seen her students express interest in the rise of political figures with socialist-leaning beliefs like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Mamdani.\n\n\"They want to look at what it would be like in America if we had politicians who were a little bit more interested in political and social and economic equality versus just sort of the unbridled dog-eat-dog world of capitalism,\" she said.\n\nThat's why an \"eat the rich\" sentiment is captivating a growing number of students, Lauren Visalli, a Texas world cultures and world geography teacher, said.\n\n\"They're becoming more aware of the big wealth gap in the US,\" Visalli said. \"And I think that's going to change perceptions of capitalism \n\nMonteleone, in Ohio, said that even before the state's financial literacy requirement, her school was already teaching an entrepreneurship class with an existing curriculum that covered the free market, business structures, and how the American economic system operates. For example, she said that her colleagues created a course where students create a business plan and pitch it to local business owners, which she said students have really enjoyed and are eager to participate in.\n\nKelsey Moskovits, a 12th-grade US government teacher at a public high school in Florida, gave her students an online political compass quiz, and she said some students discovered new political and economic beliefs they held while answering questions about how much they agreed or disagreed with statements like \"The freer the market, the freer the people.\"\n\nVisalli was a bit more old-school when it came to teaching about capitalism — she said that she used candy, or another fake currency, to simulate how different economic systems work and distribute wealth. For example, students might use their currencies to build monopolies or oligopolies to experience the benefits and costs of the different market structures.\n\nArthur Johnson, a high school history and civics teacher in North Carolina, participated in the University of Virginia's one-week institute in the summer of 2024. He said the teaching technique that has most resonated with his students is applying the history of capitalism to \"the day-to-day aspects of it.\"\n\nHe might pose an example high school students can identify with, like \"Here's what you're making right now at your part-time job, and you feel like you got a lot of money, but let's look at everything else,\" Johnson said. \"Have you noticed that your paycheck isn't going as far as it needs to go?\"\n\nLooking forward, Moskovits said it's inevitable that students' economic beliefs will be influenced by social media, but she's encouraged to see her students engaging in vibrant discussions about economic systems and forming their own opinions.\n\n\"Some kids are going to be like, 'Ah, yes, communism is this ultimate evil that we as a country had to triumph over,'\" Moskovits said. \"And there's going to be some kids who are going to feel really different from that. And that is a new kind of phenomenon to have students who even have opinions about those things.\"",

    "title": "Competition is heating up on Wall Street. Here are 4 things to watch as they report earnings.",
    "description": "From credit risks to AI, here's what experts are watching as banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, prepare to report fourth-quarter earnings.",
    "fullText": "As Wall Street's biggest banks prepare to report fourth-quarter earnings next week, competition is intensifying across nearly every part of the business — from dealmaking and talent to technology. JPMorgan Chase kicks things off Tuesday, followed by Bank of America and Citi reporting on Wednesday, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.\n\nThat competitive pressure is shaping how investors, analysts, and executives are thinking about the coming year. In an interview, Mike Mayo, a longtime Wells Fargo analyst known for his pointed questions on earnings calls, said banks are waging the toughest fight they've faced against rivals in years to capture new business.\n\n\"The animal spirits have been unleashed,\" Mayo said, adding that competition is now \"at its most intense level since before the global financial crisis,\" with banks across the industry playing offense across sectors ranging from financial advisory to investment management to consumer banking. Even before earnings get underway, some hopeful signals are already emerging — particularly around pay.\n\nAlan Johnson, the founder of compensation consultancy Johnson Associates, said initial readouts from industry insiders at firms that have already communicated compensation are pointing to a strong year. \"Banking and trading, the big winners for bonuses this year is sort of what I'm detecting,\" Johnson said. Investment banking advisory bonuses, he added, are tracking higher than he predicted, up as much as 20% from the year prior.\n\nAs earnings season gets underway, experts say there are four key things to watch.\n\nAfter a rocky start marked by tariff worries and market volatility, dealmakers finished 2025 in the green. Worldwide M&A value rose about 45% year over year, according to LSEG data, even as the total number of deals declined slightly.\n\nIn a 2026 forecast, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expect that momentum to carry forward, projecting growth in investment banking fees and a pickup in spending by financial sponsors.\n\nMatthew Toole, LSEG's director of deals intelligence, said some private equity firms are approaching a traditional exit window for companies they bought during the pandemic, setting the stage for more sponsor-driven sales.\n\n\"Coming off of the year that we've had from an investment banking perspective — the second-largest year on record for announced M&A, the largest year on record for global debt, and also a record year for syndicated lending — I think you're going to see pretty significant growth in the investment banking fee pool,\" Toole said.\n\nThat resurgence is intensifying hiring competition. Speaking at a financials conference Goldman hosted in December, Denis Coleman, the firm's chief financial officer, acknowledged the pretty penny that it was spending to hang onto its top performers.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we're in a position to pay very competitively, particularly for our very best people,\" he said.\n\nJeanne Branthover, vice chairman of DHR International and global head of the firm's financial services and fintech practice, told Business Insider that deal momentum is translating directly into hiring pressures. \"What happens is the best talent is always going to be recruited,\" she said. \"That is always the case when a market is good.\"\n\n\"Credit is still fine, certainly we're on a cockroach alert,\" Mayo said, referencing a comment made by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in October. The collapse of subprime auto-lenders Tricolor Holdings and auto-parts company First Brands last fall raised questions about the health of the credit market, and during his firm's third-quarter earnings call, Dimon said, \"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more.\"\n\nMayo added that a major surprise at large banks would be unlikely, but cautioned that credit cycles often begin with isolated problems, particularly at midsize firms. Leaders in the private credit industry have pushed back on claims that private lending is behind rising credit stress, saying some recent high-profile bankruptcies reflect risks tied to loans originated and syndicated by banks rather than held by private lenders.\n\nStill, Mayo offered a note of caution: \"When you're bullish, this is the time when bad loans are made.\"\n\nAt Goldman Sachs, attention is trained on OneGS 3.0, the latest iteration of the company's cross-bank initiative to maximize returns across business lines.\n\nMayo pointed to Goldman Sachs 3.0 as one of the most interesting new data points this earnings season.\n\nThe program, announced last fall, is designed as a multi-year effort to boost profitability and productivity by leveraging AI. Goldman has said the initiative includes head count discipline and limited role reductions.\n\nIf the past few years represented AI's Wild West — marked by widespread experimentation and spending — this year is about formalizing what works.\n\nSumeet Chabria, CEO of advisory firm ThoughtLinks and a former senior Wall Street technology executive, said AI has moved from isolated pilots to a core priority. He anticipates more detail from banking chiefs on how their firms are deploying AI to enhance results.\n\n\"Every line of business' strategic plan will have clarity on how they're using AI and how they're going to drive value, for sure,\" he said. \"The focus has moved from projects and programs or pilots to enterprise — to AI being a strategic priority for all the top banks.\"",

    "fullText": "Some billionaire CEOs and banking groups balked at President Donald Trump's proposed one-year 10% cap on credit card interest.\n\nIn an X post on Saturday, Noto wrote that the cap could encourage consumers to shift from credit cards to personal loans.\n\n\"If this is enacted—and that's a big if, though part of me hopes it is—we would likely see a significant contraction in industry credit card lending. Credit card issuers simply won't be able to sustain profitability at a 10% rate cap,\" Noto wrote. \"Consumers, however, will still need access to credit. That creates a large void—one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill.\"\n\nNoto wrote that personal loans could be an alternative for consumers looking to address debt.\n\n\"Also if this scenario plays out, underwriting discipline and borrower education become even more important,\" Noto wrote.\n\nTrump called for the cap in a Truth Social post on Friday, writing that his administration would \"no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies\" charging interest rates of 20% to 30% or more.\n\nEnacting the proposed cap would require an act of Congress. Additional details about the proposed cap haven't been released, but it has drawn concern from various corners of the financial world.\n\nBill Ackman, the billionaire CEO and founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, called the decision a \"mistake\" in a now-deleted X post on Friday.\n\n\"This is a mistake President,\" Ackman wrote. \"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid.\"\n\nAckman shared a separate X post on Saturday, writing that reducing credit card interest rates was a \"worthy and important\" goal, but still disagreed with the cap.\n\n\"My concern about capping rates at 10% is that doing so will inevitably cause millions of Americans to have their cards cancelled as credit card companies lose the ability to adequately price subprime credit risk,\" Ackman wrote. \"Consumers denied credit cards will be forced to turn to loan sharks whose rates and terms will be vastly worse for borrowers.\"\n\nSeveral banking associations — including the American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association — also criticized the proposed cap in a joint statement on Friday.\n\n\"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the statement said. \"We look forward to working with the administration to ensure Americans have access to the credit they need.\"",

    "description": "Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam is seeking to combine his party role with the state presidency, officials said, in a move that would align",
    "fullText": "HANOI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam is seeking to combine his party role with the state presidency, officials said, in a move that would align Vietnam's political structure more closely to China's ​where President Xi Jinping heads the party and state.\n\nNext week some 1,600 delegates will gather in Hanoi to kick off ‌a week-long Communist Party congress, held every five years to select new leaders and set policy goals for the single-party state.\n\nLam, 68, bid for both top positions ‌at a party meeting in December, seeking initial party approval ahead of the congress, three people briefed by the delegates and another three officials familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nWhile the sources said the party meeting backed Lam to remain party chief, the three people briefed by delegates gave differing accounts on the question of the presidency, a largely ceremonial role but one currently held by the military.\n\nTwo said Lam won support ⁠for his bid, while the third said the ‌conclusion was unclear. In any case, the final decision rests with delegates who will be elected at the congress.\n\nThe party's secretariat did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe combination of the two top ‍jobs for the next five years would mark a significant departure from Vietnam's traditional power-sharing model. Only in exceptional periods after the death of incumbents have the positions been merged, including in 2024 when Lam held both positions for about three months.\n\nShould Lam succeed, the military, a powerful faction ​within the party, would give up the presidency in exchange for maintaining a broad autonomy over the promotion of its senior officers, ‌two sources said.\n\nOne official said military leaders are negotiating \"safeguards\" to limit Lam's authority. The defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.\n\nIn possible signs of early concessions, some controversial economic policies pursued under Lam's first term were revised or faced unexpected hurdles ahead of the congress, including on credit growth and a high-speed railway.\n\nSupporters of combining the two roles argue all other communist countries - China, North Korea, Cuba and Laos - vest both positions in a single leader, and note the move would bolster Lam's economic reform agenda and strengthen his standing ⁠in meetings with foreign leaders.\n\nSceptics see the change as emboldening a leader seen ​as a risk-taker who has already vastly expanded the powers of the security apparatus.\n\nThe ​merger would be \"the natural outcome of streamlining Vietnam's political structure,\" said Carl Thayer, a senior expert on Vietnam at the Australian Defence Force Academy, noting Lam has already effectively taken over some of the president's powers with ‍frequent overseas trips last year.\n\nStarting January ⁠19, the week-long congress will elect 200 members of the new central committee, with a large number of newcomers expected to join, raising questions about whether they will confirm decisions made by the roughly 140 delegates who voted in December.\n\nThe central ⁠committee will elect the party chief and the politburo. Lam in July said the new politburo will have 17-19 members, but the size will depend on delegates' ‌votes on a pre-arranged shortlist.\n\nThe politburo will then nominate the president, prime minister and speaker of the parliament, whose ‌appointments lawmakers must confirm.",

    "title": "Homeowners file groundbreaking lawsuit over insurance costs: '[These companies have] lied for decades'",
    "description": "The plaintiffs claim the industry withheld information from the public.",
    "fullText": "Two homeowners in Washington state have filed an unprecedented lawsuit against Big Oil over skyrocketing home insurance premiums that they say are climate-related.\n\nAccording to Inside Climate News, the case was filed in late November in the U.S. District Court in the state's Western District and is the first of its kind to target dirty fuel companies over unreasonable home insurance costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs say oil companies downplayed the impacts of burning oil and gas on the climate, which has led to more frequent extreme weather events that have contributed to the insurance crisis.\n\nIn Washington, insurance premiums have risen by more than 50% since 2019. Resident Richard Kennedy, one of the homeowners involved in the lawsuit, said his premiums have more than doubled since 2017. Margaret Hazard, the other plaintiff, reported similar spikes in home insurance rates.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit they filed covers all homeowners who have or plan to buy insurance after 2017 nationwide. Homeowners insurance premiums have increased nationwide, with a January report from the Department of the Treasury showing that average premiums rose 9% faster than overall inflation from 2018 to 2022.\n\nAccording to Program Business, many homeowners near dense forests are experiencing reduced or severely limited coverage, particularly in wildfire-prone areas. A 2016 report by Climate Central found that the number of large fires burning annually has increased fivefold in Washington since the 1970s.\n\nUnfortunately, the insurance industry is trying to play catch-up because existing risk models have tended to underestimate impacts, leaving homeowners vulnerable and underinsured. Meanwhile, studies have found that the oil and gas industry has known the devastating impacts of its activities on the climate since the 1970s.\n\nBut with more states, cities, and even individuals suing oil companies to hold them accountable for the destruction brought by climate change, the tides might finally be turning.\n\nThe Washington lawsuit, Kennedy v. Exxon et al., involves both federal and state law claims, including violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy.\n\nThe plaintiffs say the industry withheld information from the public and engaged in greenwashing by portraying oil and gas as climate-friendly without taking adequate steps to protect the environment. The suit names major oil companies, including Exxon, Shell, BP, and Chevron, and alleges that the defendants have earned over $2 trillion in profits since 1990.\n\nShould the government be paying us to upgrade our homes?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWith natural disasters increasing in frequency and severity over the past decade, insurance companies have had to raise premiums to cover massive losses driven by climate-related events such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods.\n\nAccording to Hagens Berman, the law firm representing Kennedy and Hazard, the costs of natural catastrophes have far exceeded the ability of homeowners and insurers to pay in recent years.\n\n\"Higher insurance premiums are the result of the fossil fuel industry's decades-long campaign of disinformation to obstruct climate action,\" U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told Inside Climate News in an emailed statement.\n\n\"We are already seeing signs of the Great Climate Insurance Collapse, which will cascade into a collapse in property values that will trash our entire economy. Just like Big Tobacco, Big Oil has lied for decades to the American people about the full extent of the harms of its products and must be held accountable.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Mariana Tata experienced a few subtle, common symptoms of colon cancer and got them checked out. She was diagnosed at stage 4.",
    "fullText": "For about a year, Mariana wasn't sure what to make of her bloating.\n\nSometimes, she assumed it was just part of being a woman with a regular menstrual cycle. She also had some friends with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, thinking she had similar GI issues.\n\nThen, in April, she noticed blood in her stool — one of the most common symptoms of colon cancer in young people.\n\n\"That alarmed me a little bit,\" Tata, 26, told Business Insider. When it didn't go away for a month, she called her primary care physician, who believed the cause was hemorrhoids but sent Tata to get an abdominal scan just in case, as she was also diagnosed with anemia a few years before and suddenly had worsened symptoms.\n\nThe scan revealed a 20-centimeter tumor on one of her ovaries. Tata was sent to Syracuse Hospital in New York, where more testing led to a stage 4 colon cancer diagnosis, with the cancer spreading to her abdominal wall. Shortly after, both of her ovaries and fallopian tubes would be removed, Tata losing her ability to have biological children.\n\nTata, still in treatment, remembers being shocked. \"When you're young, you don't think that it's cancer,\" she said. \"Colon cancer was not in my mind at all.\"\n\nPrior to her diagnosis, Tata and her boyfriend discussed their future: Having kids and buying a house together.\n\nPlans changed when she needed surgery to remove the large mass on her right ovary, which she soon learned damaged her left ovary as well. \"There was no option to save any of my eggs,\" Tata said, meaning she would have to carry donated eggs or embryos through IVF.\n\nFor now, Tata said, that means she's letting go of the idea of having children. Knowing she'd have to pay for cancer treatment also made her rethink other plans, like the house.\n\nBefore she hit her deductible, she was \"scraping together\" as much as she could to pay for the ER visits, CT scan, abdominal scan, and blood work. While she said some friends helped put together a GoFundMe to help with costs, she's still paying off a hospital bill from the summer that cost nearly $1,000, and anticipates future treatment costs.\n\n\"It is very rough, especially in your 20s and 30s when you plan on using your money for something else and then you get hit with cancer,\" she said. \"You have to reevaluate what you're actually spending your money on.\"\n\nTata splits her time between two homes, based on her chemotherapy schedule. On the night before her next treatment, she leaves the apartment she shares with her boyfriend to go to her parents' house. Because her boyfriend works and her parents are retired, she can get more around-the-clock care there.\n\n\"My mom is the one who nurses me back to health, basically,\" Tata said, giving her anti-nausea medication around the clock. \"My family has been absolutely amazing, and I think my being so strong comes from them because they carry me whenever I can't do it anymore.\"\n\nTata, who had parts of her colon removed prior to starting chemotherapy, feels she bounces back better from treatments than other cancer patients she's spoken to. On the alternating weeks that she doesn't have chemotherapy, she said she almost forgets she has cancer, focusing more on getting her strength back.\n\nBut the days when she gets disconnected from her chemo pump are brutal, usually lasting from Wednesday to Monday.\n\n\"It kind of punches you in the face and reminds you every two weeks that you have to go through this and you are sick,\" she said. \"It's kind of just my new reality.\"\n\nAs of now, Tata is considered stable, with no progression of cancer as she continues chemotherapy treatment.\n\n\"My oncologist expects me to go back to work in February, which is very nice,\" she said. Tata, who is still employed as an enrollment operations assistant at her alma mater, Utica University, went on short-term and long-term disability during treatment.\n\nShe's hoping her treatments become more scattered after chemotherapy, helping her to more closely return to the routine she had before her diagnosis.\n\nShe said connecting with other colon cancer patients through the Colorectal Cancer Alliance and a Facebook group helped her get more comfortable with sharing her experience.\n\n\"At the beginning of my diagnosis, I didn't know what to do with myself,\" she said. \"I felt so alone, and I wasn't ready to talk to people.\" Connecting with others made it easier to deal with her ongoing treatment.\n\nIt also made her more aware of the rising rates of cancer among young people.\n\n\"I feel like young people are the margin of the forgotten who do face this,\" she said. Given how subtle colon cancer symptoms can be, she hopes other young people take action if they sense a change in their body.\n\n\"Go to the doctor, no matter how big or small it is,\" she said. \"Because what I thought was a small thing turned into a very big thing.\"\n\nShe also emphasized advocating for yourself and even seeking out second opinions, because \"not a lot of doctors jump when you notice bleeding in your stool.\" In her case, she's grateful that hers took immediate action.\n\n\"If my doctor didn't recommend a CT scan or abdominal scan, I don't know where I would be right now,\" she said.",

    "description": "Marc Andreessen said that his VC firm benefits \"the more outspoken we are.\" Startup founders are drawn to their candid messaging, he said.",
    "fullText": "Most executives wobble at the thought of controversy. Marc Andreessen embraces it.\n\nThe venture capitalist and cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz has been a lightning rod for Silicon Valley, voicing his opinions loudly and publicly. That includes drawing a fair share of backlash — something he seems unfazed by.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the more out there we are, and the more outspoken we are, and the more controversial we are, the better for the business,\" Andreessen said on \"The A16z Show.\"\n\nAndreessen's controversies are a pull for founders, he said, because they want to work with investors who are \"brave\" and \"articulate things clearly.\"\n\nQuiet venture capitalists leave founders in the dark, he said. A16z has taken the opposite approach.\n\n\"It teaches them who we are before they even meet us,\" Andreessen said. \"That has proven to be this incredible competitive advantage.\"\n\nAndreessen and his firm have made waves in recent years. After backing every Democratic presidential candidate from Bill Clinton to Hillary, Andreessen did an about-face in the 2024 election and threw his support behind Donald Trump — a move that proved controversial in liberal-leaning San Francisco circles.\n\nThe month after Trump's victory, Andreessen said that he spent roughly \"half\" his time at Mar-a-Lago discussing policy issues with the president-elect.\n\nA16z also hired Daniel Penny, the Marine veteran acquitted in the subway killing of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless street performer.\n\nWhat was A16z's most controversial investment? Cofounder Ben Horowitz pointed to Flow, the real estate startup founded by WeWork's Adam Neumann.\n\nThey're not alone. Venture capital has become a high-stakes \"fame game,\" industry veterans told Business Insider. When Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire called then-New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani an \"Islamist,\" he did not apologize and kept his job amid a social-media uproar.\n\nThe strategy seems to be working for Andreesen Horowitz. The firm announced that it raised over $15 billion in new funds on Friday, a massive sum that far surpasses those of competitors like Lux Capital and Lightspeed.\n\nOn \"The A16z Show,\" Andreessen acknowledged that the approach was \"generally true across the industry.\" Andreessen talks about the company's public footprint often with Horowitz, possibly because he's \"second-guessing\" himself, he said.\n\n\"He and I do go back and forth a bit,\" Andreessen said. \"How many third rail topics should we touch?\"",

    "description": "David Moss, a Tesla owner since 2024, said he traveled 11,000 miles across the US with Full Self-Driving. He said FSD is indispensable.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Moss, 28, a resident of Puyallup, Washington, who has been documenting his experience with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), Tesla's advanced driver assistance system. Moss told Business Insider that he does not own Tesla stock.\n\nBusiness Insider verified Moss's travel logs, charging stops, and FSD mileage data that is displayed on his car. Tesla only displays FSD usage down to the 10th of a mile.\n\nI've owned a Tesla since March 2024.\n\nTesla's Full Self-Driving feature was the primary reason I made the purchase. I would say the electric aspect is almost an inconvenience, and FSD is my main interest in the Tesla.\n\nCharging around my hometown isn't a pain. There's a station near my house, and I have a charger at home.\n\nHowever, my commutes are long. I'm a product manager for a company that makes 3D lidar scanners, and a lot of my job is visiting clients on-site all around America.\n\nI drive over 50,000 miles a year. Given the number of miles I drive, an electric car is a slower form of transportation than a gas car.\n\nMy first Tesla was a Cybertruck, but unfortunately, I totaled it in August while I was driving it in off-road mode. In September, I bought the long-range Model 3. The company was running a promotion where if you bought a Model 3 before the tax credit expired, you got a free year of charging.\n\nSince then, I've put over 23,000 miles on the car. So I've been making good use of the free electricity.\n\nI began a road trip on October 28 and have since driven 18,741 miles.\n\nAround November 25, while I was in Raleigh, North Carolina, I got the FSD version 14.2 update and have driven over 11,000 miles without any intervention as of December 31.\n\nWhen I say no intervention, I mean down to the 10th of a mile — 100% no steering wheel or pedal touches. That includes parking and getting into a charging station.\n\nFSD navigated restaurants, supercharger stations, office complexes — every single part of the drive.\n\nDuring the trip, I've gone down several dirt roads and construction zones that had cones, reroutes, and road closures. One morning, I was in Reno, leaving my hotel, and the normal road was closed for construction. The car immediately turned around and found an alternative route.\n\nOne of the more interesting cases was in Wyoming during a severe windstorm.\n\nThere were alerts, warning of 80 mph winds. In about a hundred-mile stretch, I saw six different tipped-over semi-trucks.\n\nI was a little nervous about driving on the freeway with high-wind caution alerts, but FSD handled everything while I was on Interstate 80, traveling from Cheyenne to Evanston. FSD drove without even touching a lane marker once.\n\nI think in that situation, FSD shone more than usual.\n\nSince Raleigh, I've traveled across the country — down to Miami, across Texas, through the Rockies, and up to Medford, Oregon.\n\nAfter a two-day pit stop back in my hometown in Washington for Christmas Eve, I headed to Los Angeles and drove across the US until I hit South Carolina.\n\nI put on a lot of audiobooks and podcasts while FSD drives. I also took business calls or calls with friends and family.\n\nI haven't tested out being on my phone with my eyes off the road. That's still against the law, and it's just not worth the risk.\n\nI've never dozed off during the drive, but I'm also not constantly on the edge of my seat or grimacing while FSD is on.\n\nI'm a million times less scared than I've ever been in an Uber ride or with most of my friends. If I had to sum it up in one sentence, I'd say it's the most pleasant driving I've experienced.\n\nWhen I started my road trip on October 28, my Tesla was on FSD version 13.2.9.\n\nEventually, when I was in the southern part of Alberta in Canada, I installed version 14.1. That was around the evening of November 5. Around November 25, I got 14.2.\n\nI have a Starlink Mini mounted underneath my Tesla's glass roof, allowing me to download updates remotely and install them while I sleep in my hotel room.\n\nI wouldn't call the difference between 14.1 and 14.2 a grand night-and-day difference, but there's definitely been a noticeable improvement under version 14: the ability to park, more speed profiles like \"Sloth\" and \"Mad Max\" mode, and just the overall smoothness.\n\nFor the first time, with 14.2, I was able to win people over when I showed FSD to my friends and family. Before they were like, \"Oh, that's kind of cool,\" \"It's a gimmick,\" or \"I'm not going to buy this.\" Now, they're saying, \"Oh wow, I actually need that.\"\n\nI can't speak enough about how much I love FSD and how much it inconveniences me to drive.\n\nA lot of the driving I currently do is simply because I don't want to fly. Because I know that when I arrive at the airport, I'm likely not going to be able to rent a car with FSD.\n\nThe record-setting was never really the focus.\n\nI didn't even check the FSD stat page for several hundred miles before I started seeing people post about it online, saying, \"Oh wow, I've actually not touched the wheel at all.\"\n\nAt this point, a technology like FSD is indispensable to having a car. The feature provides me with peace of mind, having that \"extra set of eyes\" on the road.\n\nThere's also a personal side to that because my father is legally blind and can't operate a vehicle. If there were one day an unsupervised Cybercab that he could buy, we'd buy it on day one.\n\nMy father's ecstatic. He believes he's one day closer to gaining his independence.",

    "description": "My grandmother is 98, and she's changed how I think about aging. Her positive perspective, friends, and faith contribute to her longevity.",
    "fullText": "In 2019, I lived in Washington, DC, and my Grandma Lenora lived in Minnesota. We often talked on the phone, and during that time, we had our first conversation about her outlook on life. It's a conversation that stuck with me.\n\nShe was having a lot of neck pain, and it was hard for her to find any sort of relief. I asked her how she always had such a good attitude, and she said, \"Being grumpy doesn't help anyone. I'm not happy about what's going on, but it is what it is, and it makes others happier when you're not grumpy too.\"\n\nHer sunny perspective truly sank in when I started to think about everything she had gone through in her life.\n\nShe lost a daughter due to a preterm birth. Her husband — my grandpa — was in a farming accident that left him with lifelong mobility challenges. She gave up going to nursing school to help her family on their farm. Then, she later lost my grandfather after over 50+ years of marriage together.\n\nYet, her outlook on life is probably the most positive of anyone I know, and I've learned a lot from her.\n\nMy grandma has always grabbed life by the horns and made the most of every opportunity.\n\nI always like to say she was the original influencer because she has this photo from a trip to Italy in the 80s that is reminiscent of the way travel creators often pose for photos now.\n\nEven with my grandpa's mobility challenges, they went to places like Egypt, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Italy, and the Netherlands well into their retirement years. They took advantage of every opportunity they could to spend time with their friends and have new experiences.\n\nSeveral of her trips definitely influenced me to visit the same places, including the birthplace of her father — my great-grandfather!\n\nWhen my grandpa died, she moved into a senior living co-op where she became a figure in the building because of her sugar cookies and her positive attitude. She attended exercise classes and went to building events with her new friends.\n\nShe has taken every challenge and life change at face value with that \"It is what it is\" attitude.\n\nHer faith is also a central part of her life. When I asked her what she thinks has contributed to her long life, she said, \"I don't think I've done anything special, but God has been with me the whole time.\"\n\nHumble, grateful, and generous — she has always been about loving the people around her and has continued to stay grateful through the challenges.\n\nAlthough she and my grandfather had only an 8th-grade education, they built a thriving farming business. My grandmother also has a generous heart, and she and my grandfather have given a lot of their money away to organizations focused on supporting young people, from kids' camps to orphanages to local universities. I believe this has also contributed to her long life.\n\nHer perspective on the world is something I hope to carry with me as I age. She never complains, has embraced the final years of her life with gratitude.\n\nWhen I asked her recently if she had any other thoughts on her long life, she said, \"I'm not too special, I'm just very thankful for all I have.\"\n\nI believe my Grandma Lenora's long life is a testament to her humility, gratitude, and giving spirit. And because of all of these traits, she would never brag about anything she's done and claim it's the reason for her long life.\n\nThese traits, in combination with her years working and living on farms, have kept her strong both emotionally, mentally, and physically. Just last year, she was still peeling and cooking countless apples to make batches of homemade applesauce for her family, and loves to make us sugar cookies, too.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian drone strike killed one person and wounded three others in the Russian city of Voronezh, local officials said Sunday. Meanwhile, thousands of residents were still without power in Kyiv, following an intense Russian bombardment.\n\nA young woman died overnight in a hospital intensive care unit after debris from a drone fell on a house during the attack on Saturday, Voronezh regional Gov. Alexander Gusev said on Telegram.\n\nThree other people were wounded and more than 10 apartment buildings, private houses and a high school were damaged, he said, adding that air defenses shot down 17 drones over Voronezh. The city is home to just over 1 million people and lies some 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nUkraine's General Staff said Sunday said its forces hit three drilling platforms operated by Russian oil giant Lukoil in the waters of the Caspian Sea. Ukraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion.\n\nThe attacks came after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, killing at least four people in the capital Kyiv, according to Ukrainian officials. For only the second time in the nearly four-year war, Russia used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv and NATO.\n\nUkraine’s largest private energy supplier, DTEK, said Sunday that 30,000 people in Kyiv were still without power following the attack. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday around half the apartment buildings — nearly 6,000 — in snowy Kyiv were left without heat in daytime temperatures of about minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 Fahrenheit).\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further aggression by Moscow if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly address that Ukrainian negotiators “continue to communicate with the American side.”\n\nChief negotiator Rustem Umerov was in contact with U.S. partners on Saturday, he said.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine’s General Staff said Russia targeted Ukraine with 154 drones overnight into Sunday and 125 were shot down.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate said Sunday that Russia this month deployed the new jet-powered “Geran-5” strike drone against Ukraine for the first time. The Geran is a Russian variant of the Iranian-designed Shahed.\n\nAccording to the directorate, the drone can carry a 90-kilogram (200-pound) warhead and has a range of nearly 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Humpback whales occasionally swim to boats as if curious about their human occupants. It's a behavior described as mugging.\n\nBut on Saturday off San Diego, a humpback whale seemed more curious about a furry rescue dog named Fin – and vice versa.\n\nThe accompanying footage, captured by Gone Whale Watching San Diego, shows Fin enthusiastically greeting a humpback whale that surfaced just feet from the vessel’s bow.\n\nDominic Biagini, owner of the company, stated via Instagram: “Watching my dog fall in love with whales has been one of the great joys of my life!”\n\nThe heartwarming interaction occurred after Jess Aubry, a Gone Whale Watching San Diego captain, encountered a large pod of humpback whales during a five-hour excursion. Biagini traveled to the location with his partner, Erica Sackrison, and Fin.\n\nSackrison commented via Instagram: “Who’s watching who?”\n\nAubury remarked: “That tail is going a mile a minute.”\n\nOne follower observed that Fin seems to be the boat's only occupant.\n\nFin, a mixed yellow lab/golden retriever, was rescued by Biagini near the U.S.-San Diego border.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Rescue dog greeted by whale in heartwarming encounter off San Diego",

    "fullText": "Former England midfielder Fara Williams says West Ham's Estelle Cascarino made a \"schoolgirl error\" when she was denied the chance to make her debut because of an earring.\n\nWest Ham's new boss Rita Guarino, who was taking charge of her first game on Sunday, attempted to bring on Juventus loanee Cascarino at the start of the second half with her side trailing 4-0 to Chelsea in the Women's Super League.\n\nBut the 28-year-old defender was denied permission to enter the action because she was wearing an earring that had been covered by tape but could not be taken out.\n\nFootball Association rules state that \"all items of jewellery are forbidden and must be removed\", with no allowances made.\n\n\"I know you used to be able to have earrings taped. But the modern game doesn't allow for it,\" Williams told The Women's Football Show.\n\n\"It's a schoolgirl error for me, a new signing wanting to make an impression, and that's not the impression you'd want.\"\n\nCascarino was allowed to play without tape covering her inner-ear piercing during her time at Juventus.\n\nHowever, the FA rule specifies that even using tape to cover any jewellery is not permitted in England.\n\nGuarino said: \"She [Cascarino] can't take off this earring; it's like a tattoo. She needs a doctor to take it off and she had tape.\n\n\"She played in the Champions League with tape, so I can't understand how we missed using a player in a game for this.\"\n\nFormer Wales defender Nia Jones said the entire situation was an \"absolute circus\" for West Ham, who went on to lose the fixture 5-0.\n\n\"She's an experienced player, a French international formerly of Juventus and PSG,\" Jones said.\n\n\"I was glad to see she didn't get to come on at all because I thought that was a bit embarrassing.\"",

They were the biggest-spending club in France last summer, outgunning even Paris St-Germain (£89.2m).\n\nSuccess on the pitch was underpinned by the attacking and exciting football under Liam Rosenior. Until now.\n\nLast week the Englishman left to take charge of Chelsea. Those who were happy to accept success over a loss of autonomy in a multi-club ownership (MCO) structure now know the trade-off.\n\nThere is evidence that opinion appears to be changing as fans find out what it means to be the perceived subservient partner.\n\nStrasbourg-based L'Equipe journalist Cyril Olives-Berthet says BlueCo have \"shot themselves in the foot\".\n\n\"The general opinion is utter shock,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Even people who thought there was some interesting stuff with BlueCo are shocked.\n\n\"BlueCo had a relatively good image around France after last season. That is Rosenior, the players and the style of play.\n\n\"The backlash is harsh, in the media and with football fans.\"\n\nGary O'Neil has arrived as Rosenior's successor but Olives-Berthet says there is much scepticism. Supporters feel the 42-year-old lacks the experience for the job, having amassed 100 games during managerial spells at Bournemouth and Wolves.",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Chargers are the perpetual disappointments of the NFL",
    "fullText": "When someone tells you who they are, believe them.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have tried telling us they shouldn't be taken seriously for half of a decade, and yet every year before the season begins, multiple folks in the NFL media world will get on their respective platforms and proclaim, \"Woah now, watch out for the Chargers - this is the year they stop being complete crap.\"\n\nThat year has yet to come. The Chargers were defeated handedly by the New England Patriots by the score of 16-3 in the wild card round on Sunday night. While the Chargers have made the postseason in each of the first two years of the Jim Harbaugh era, they have been blown out in both of their wild card playoff games by a combined score of 48-15 and have scored just one touchdown across those two games. That brings us to their polarizing quarterback, who turned in yet another playoff stinker.\n\nHerbert continued building his poor playoff portfolio on Sunday, going 19-of-31 for 159 yards and getting sacked six times. Dating back to the second half of the Chargers' playoff collapse to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2021 postseason, Herbert has played outright awful in the playoffs. In his last 10 quarters of postseason play, he has completed just 50.6 percent of his passes with one touchdown, four interceptions, and has been sacked 12 times. And while the Chargers' offensive line has been largely bad in 2025, Herbert did himself no favors against the Patriots, running into several sacks and shooting himself in the foot a fair amount of times.\n\nConsidering the flip that seems to switch in the biggest games for Herbert, he should be nowhere near conversations regarding the top five quarterbacks in the NFL. He is now 0-3 in the playoffs, and has yet to put together a quality postseason performance in six seasons. Now, he's been surpassed by the quarterback on the other sideline on Sunday. Drake Maye has been in the NFL for 20 months and just played in his first playoff game, and yet he is already more accomplished than Herbert. When you throw in what Trevor Lawrence did this season and the fact that he has more playoff success than Herbert, as well, the former No. 6 overall pick quickly starts sliding down the list of top quarterbacks in the league.\n\nUntil the Chargers, and their quarterback, find a way to play a complete playoff game and actually win in the postseason, they will not be taken seriously as a team who can make a real run - nor should they. They have become the Lob City Los Angeles Clippers of the NFL. Flashy in the regular season with many a tweet showing highlights with an eyeball emoji, but paper tigers that crumble when the games really count.\n\nEagle star defender reveals loss to 49ers may have been his last game with Philadelphia\n\nTimeline of drama between Philadelphia Eagles, A.J.

    "fullText": "SPRINGFIELD–For the first time since 2014, the Kansas City Chiefs are not in the NFL playoffs, and it’s a weird feeling down here, in Arrowhead South.\n\nSince the fall of 2015, the Chiefs had won 10 consecutive AFC West Division titles, and competed in the postseason each year. The height of KC’s playoff prowess came between 2019-2024, when the team reached the Super Bowl five times and won three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nHowever, the annual magic Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid are known for cooking up never materialized in 2025. Mahomes suffered a season-ending injury, a torn ACL, with three games left in the season, and watched as KC finished a disappointing 6-11, which was good enough to be second-to-last in the AFC West Division.\n\nSo, without their beloved team in the postseason for the first time, in more than a decade, how did Chiefs fans feel? Were they relieved? Upset? Indifferent? To find out the answers, I went to the Chiefs Mecca of the Ozarks, Coyotes Adobe Cafe. A.K.A. Arrowhead South.\n\nSure enough, I quickly ran into two fans — Deante Johnson and Jack Murphy. Both guys were about college age and shared their thoughts on having no dog in the fight in the playoffs.\n\n“Every year can’t be a winning year, so, we just gotta sit this one out and hope next year’s better,” said Deante Johnson. “Definitely a speed bump, it’s definitely not over. I mean, if we still have Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid, we’ll be fine.”\n\nMurphy echoed Johnson’s comments.\n\n“Last year was definitely heartbreaking,” said Jack Murphy. “Especially kinda getting pretty ran over in that super bowl, wasn’t fun, but as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid I mean, we can get right back there.”\n\nGlass-half-full kinda guys. The kind of fans you want to hear from. However, did they even care about the playoffs if the Chiefs weren’t in it? Or were they rooting for another team?\n\n“It’s been interesting,” Johnson said. “The NFL has definitely had a lot of unexpected teams come out, like Chicago…so it’s been fun to watch.”\n\nMurphy concurred and even admitted he’d like to see a team from the NFC take home the Super Bowl crown.\n\n“The Seahawks, for sure,” Murphy said. “I think it’s a really great story. I really like their head coach, and JSN (Jaxon Smith-Njigba) is a monster.”\n\nAs for Coyotes management, they too were disappointed Kansas City’s streak came to an unexpected end, but they still drew a good crowd for Sunday’s AFC wildcard game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n“For a decade that’s all we knew, but this year is a little different,” General Manager Jared Presley said. “We actually have other fans coming in this year and today we actually filled up with a bunch of Bills fans and a bunch of Jaguars, so it’s kind of a change, it’s good to see, but at the same time we’re kinda heart broken the Chiefs aren’t here.”\n\nOverall, the fanbase is still a little sore they don’t get to see if their favorite team vie for a chance to claim its fifth Super Bowl title, but, as Deante & Jack stated, “as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid, I mean, we can get right back there.”",

    "fullText": "Drake Maye stats vs. Chargers: How Patriots QB overcame turnovers in playoff debut to advance originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter an MVP-like sophomore season, expectations were set high for Drake Maye's playoff debut on Sunday night.\n\nThe New England Patriots quarterback has a chance to become one of the youngest MVPs ever for his regular season numbers, as he set his team up well to contend for a Super Bowl by going 14-3 with an AFC East title. Facing the Los Angeles Chargers in his first postseason game, however, things didn't go as smoothly for Maye.\n\nThe Patriots pulled out a 16-3 win thanks to their defense's dominance, a collection of field goals and a late offensive push. Especially in the second half, Maye came through with a few big plays, helping mask what was otherwise shaping up to be of the worst games of the young passer's career.\n\nHere's a look at Drake Maye's turnovers against the Chargers and how he overcame them to lead the Patriots to the divisional round.\n\nMORE: Where did Patriots-Chargers rank among lowest-scoring playoff games ever?\n\nEspecially in the first half against Los Angeles, Maye did not look like the same quarterback he was throughout the 2025 season. While he had a few nice scrambles to set up field goals, the second-year quarterback wasn't finding many answers in Jim Harbaugh's defense.\n\nOn the Patriots' second drive of the game, Maye's pass was tipped at the line, then intercepted by Daiyan Henley.\n\nTIPPED AND INTERCEPTED BY DAIYAN HENLEY\n\nLACvsNE on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/Q8MjVmiGin\n\nThe second turnover of the day for Maye came in the second half, as he lost the ball while being sacked in the third quarter.\n\nOdafe Oweh knocks it loose!\nDa'Shawn Hand recovers!\n\nChargers ball ⚡️\n\nLACvsNE on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/YzXV08M6gu\n\nFortunately for Maye, the Chargers were never able to truly capitalize off his mistakes with the Patriots' defense all over Justin Herbert. Maye went on to recover from his struggles, leading New England to a playoff victory.\n\nPostgame, Mike Vrabel said he thought the Patriots \"got to take care of the football,\" but Maye \"came through when we needed him.\"\n\n\"The tipped pass is something that was unfortunate,\" Vrabel said. \"The throw to Hunter [Henry] I thought, when we needed him, was elite.”\n\nMike Vrabel on Drake Maye’s up-and-down day against the Chargers:\n\n“We got to take care of the football.

Unlike many of his performances throughout 2025, the Patriots quarterback struggled to make big plays or find open receivers, especially in the first half.\n\nMaye's first-half completion percentage of 40% was his lowest all season, per ESPN. Still, the young passer managed to put those struggles behind him by leading the Patriots to a win in the second half. According to OptaSTATS, Maye became the youngest player in NFL history with at least 250 passing yards and 50 rushing yards in a playoff victory.\n\nParticularly with his legs, Maye was able to set up multiple field-goal drives for New England. Just before halftime, he took advantage of some wide-open field, sprinting up the middle for a big gain that resulted in the Patriots taking a 6-3 lead.\n\nDrake Maye running!\n\nLACvsNE on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/1nVJgJtjeE\n\nThroughout the night, Maye came through with some key first downs when the Patriots needed them.\n\nDrake Fake!\n\nLACvsNE on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/bS92Gghnu8\n\nFinally, the big plays started to show up for Maye and his offense in the final 18 minutes.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks fell flat Friday night against the Indiana Hoosiersin the Peach Bowl. Not only did it end their season, but it may have also marked the end of Moore's Ducks career, despite only being just 20 years old.\n\nSome experts suggest Moore would be right to return to Eugene, such as ESPN's Todd McShay. But Moore himself, however, is unsure.\n\n“I’m going to soak this moment up,” Moore told reporters. \"That’s most important. Just giving hugs and thank-yous to my teammates. But at the end of the day, I don’t know my decision yet. I’m going to talk to Coach Lanning, talk to my family and everybody. At the end of the day, I don’t want to think about that right now.”\n\nMore: Dylan Raiola's transfer rumor with Oregon Ducks is crazy news for Nebraska ex-QB\n\nNFL Draft analyst Dane Brugler suggested further that Moore's choice should be an easy one, he wrote.\n\n“Tonight’s 1st half is why many believe Dante Moore is staying in school,” Brugler tweeted. “Extremely talented player who is still very young in a lot of areas.”\n\nDucks coach Dan Lanning said the team, including Moore, regardless of his decision, will grow from the 56-22 loss.\n\nMore: Urban Meyer reveals huge reality about why Indiana is college football's best team\n\n“I think every man can learn from adversity,\" Lanning said. \"I just told that whole locker room, right, this is going to be about how you respond in life. This is going to be a life lesson that a lot of people never get. We just got our butt kicked. Right? That's going to happen in life, right, and not just Dante. Every single person in the locker room, every coach, every person can learn, 'Hey, how do you respond to that?' Some people crawl into a hole, right, don't face the music.”\n\nIt's unclear when Moore will definitively decide his future.

    "fullText": "Mitch Johnson is not too worried about his trio of guards after some rough performances originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs have had an interesting few weeks, getting some big wins against the Oklahoma City Thunder and the New York Knicks. Despite some of the wins, they have also lost some games, including defeats to the Memphis Grizzlies and Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nDuring the most recent stretch, certain players have been struggling. The three guards, De'Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle, and Dylan Harper, have not played well. Against the Timberwolves, they went 7-for-35 as a trio, missing every three-pointer attempt.\n\nAs the head coach of the Spurs, Mitch Johnson knows his team's strengths. They have a lot of good players, including the superstar, Victor Wembanyama. Beyond their giant superstar, the Spurs still have a good cast of players, headlined by the three guards.\n\nWhile the recent performances have been worrying, the upside for this Spurs trio is still quite high. The two young guards are the future of this team alongside Wembanyama. It is a rough stretch for Fox as the veteran, but he has proven that he can get past that in the past.\n\nMore: Dylan Harper admits the Spurs have a 'scary' team with their talented trio of guards\n\nIt can be challenging to balance a trio of guards because they are all reliant on handling the ball. The Spurs have done it well so far this season, as Johnson's system maximizes all of their strengths.\n\nUnfortunately, they are all in a slump at the same time. That is rare, but Johnson knows that his players are capable of doing more. He trusts them to bounce back strong, given their talents.\n\n\"Part of it is they're missing good shots. Part of it, specifically for the two younger guys, they just need to learn the balance of what this game calls upon when they have the basketball a lot. Whether that's being aggressive, knowing when it's time to score, on time and on target passing,\" Johnson said after losing to the Timberwolves.\n\n\"There is some stuff there they have to go through. It's no different from when they were flying high, and the box scores were full. That's part of the deal when you're 21 and 19 in this league.\"\n\nAs long as they keep developing and trusting their talents, they can bounce back strong. This is mostly for the two young players, as Fox has already proven to be an All-Star in the NBA. If they can keep developing, the future is bright for the Spurs.\n\nSpurs’ Dylan Harper highlighted in latest rookie power rankings\n\nMitch Johnson admits Victor Wembanyama still has some room to left to grow\n\nJeremy Sochan gets honest about getting benched by the San Antonio Spurs this season\n\nRich Paul reveals surprising truth about Spurs' De'Aaron Fox\n\nSpurs' Victor Wembanyama defied gravity with absurd kick to the rim",

    "description": "Conor McGregor has always spoken in big visions. Sometimes it’s about fighting or legacy.",
    "fullText": "Conor McGregor has always spoken in big visions. Sometimes it’s about fighting or legacy. And occasionally, out of nowhere, it’s about something so far removed from the Octagon that it completely catches fans off guard. This week was one of those times when ‘The Notorious’ traded his gloves and brash attitude for a message that sounded more like a Sunday sermon.\n\nTo make things more interesting, it came at a time when he’s supposed to be locked into comeback mode. Yet his latest post didn’t feel like him marketing his possible UFC return at the White House. It felt like belief, a genuine outpouring of faith, tinged with Irish patriotism, and an unexpected nod to a country he believes is leading the way.\n\nTaking to his Instagram, Conor McGregor posted an image of a massive Jesus Christ statue and shared his dream without hesitation: the belief that Ireland, too, would build a similar statue that would be more than just a structure; it would be a national symbol, and something Ireland should rally behind.\n\nHe wrote, “I have a dream to construct the largest statue of Jesus Christ in Ireland! A massive monument to our nation’s faith.” Then came the bit no one expected: the praise for Armenia. After all, the country is building a massive Jesus statue on Mount Hatis, planned to be the world’s tallest and a symbol of national identity.\n\nSo, further in his caption, ‘The Notorious’ praised the country for taking such an initiative. “Armenia are currently constructing the world’s largest, and it looks magnificent! Bravo Armenia!\n\n” It is worth noting that the timing of the post wasn’t coincidental either.\n\nConor McGregor tied it to the Feast of the Lord’s Baptism, as the now spiritual version of the former UFC double champion couldn’t help but pray for his fans. “Today is the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord! 11th of the 1st, 2026. Where we celebrate Jesus’ baptism! May the Holy Spirit renew you and remind you, you are loved! Happy Sunday everyone\n\nIt is consistent with a version of ‘The Notorious’ that we have been hearing more of lately: less chaotic, more introspective, and more faith-based. Back in late 2025, he publicly stated his relationship with belief as something that changed his entire mindset. He wasn’t shy about how strongly he felt it either.\n\n“I’m saved,” McGregor said, as if he were convincing both himself and the fans. “I am healed…” To him, this is not a phase, but fuel. He even claimed that his competitive drive has returned in full form, describing the spark as “a roaring blaze.”\n\nWell, there is no denying that a change is visible for fans to see. While his dream of his country building a Jesus Christ statue isn’t under way just yet, his new drive is surely taking him a step closer to his UFC comeback, though.\n\nThat renewed faith has started showing up in his training, too. His dream about the statue feels like long-term legacy talk, but the day-to-day version of this “saved” Conor McGregor looks a lot more familiar: obsessed with his craft, intense energy, and a man trying to turn belief into momentum before the window closes.\n\n‘The Notorious’ hasn’t fought since breaking his leg against Dustin Poirier at UFC 264, and he is still serving an 18-month ban for failing to provide accurate whereabouts information to anti-doping officials. However, the clock is finally turning in his favor. He’ll be allowed to compete again on March 20, making his bid for the UFC White House event on June 14 seem more possible than it has in years.\n\nHe surely is working for it. McGregor recently shared training photos on social media wearing a blood-soaked headguard and draped in the Irish flag, captioned “Blood, sweat, tears.” A day earlier, he posted sparring photos and stated, “The Mac is back in the lab.” So, while his plan for the statue might still be on paper, fans can clearly see him turning his other dream into reality: to headline the White House event.\n\nThe post Conor McGregor Reveals His Religious Irish Dream While Praising Armenia for “Magnificent” Move appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "The Utah Mammoth made it to overtime, but they were not happy with their effort — or the result",
    "fullText": "Each time the Utah Mammoth and Columbus Blue Jackets have met in NHL action, the visiting team has won 3-2 in overtime. Their matchup at the Delta Center on Sunday, their third all-time, was no exception.\n\nHere’s the story of Sunday’s game.\n\nThe first 10 minutes set the Mammoth off on the wrong foot. They went down 1-0 while getting outshot 8-0. The goal came at the hands of Mikael Pyyhtiä, who had yet to score this season.\n\nJack McBain tied the score with perhaps the most fortuitous bounce of his career, as Clayton Keller’s shot hit him on the shoulder and bounced past Blue Jackets goalie Jet Greaves.\n\nThey don’t ask how — they ask how many, right?\n\nOnce the first-period jitters were out of the way the Mammoth improved, but they still got out-battled, outshot and out-chanced.\n\n“I don’t know what the analytics say, but it felt like we were under siege quite a bit,” said Mammoth defenseman Mikhail Sergachev. “We didn’t make the right decisions at the right times.”\n\nSergachev and Charlie Coyle traded goals in the second period, but the game-defining moment was Daniil But’s tripping penalty with 34 seconds to go in regulation.\n\nHis team killed enough time to make it to overtime and earn the guaranteed point, but it’s harder to kill off a 4-on-3 than a 5-on-4 — and that was the difference in the game.\n\nDmitri Voronkov tipped a Zach Werenski pass past Vítek Vaněček to end it 1:01 into the extra frame. At first glance, it looked like a standard pass along the ice for a relatively easy tap-in, but watching it again, it’s clear that Voronkov actually picked it out of mid-air with the shaft of his stick, rather than the blade.\n\nThat’s got to be as difficult as hitting an MLB pitcher’s fastball.\n\nBLUE JACKETS SNAP A FOUR-GAME LOSING STREAK 🫰\n\nZach Werenski finds Dmitri Voronkov for the Subway Canada OT winner! pic.twitter.com/eAmwU9WfbY\n\n— Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) January 12, 2026\n\nUntil this game, Vaněček was a perfect 7-0-0 all-time against the Blue Jackets. He’s still an impressive 7-0-1, but it stings because he badly needed a victory.\n\nVaněček’s last win came on Oct. 26. His losing streak is now up to 10 games. That makes it seem like he’s not doing enough, but that simply hasn’t been the case in most of his recent losses.\n\nHe’s just catching his team on some of its worst offensive nights. The Mammoth have never scored more than three goals in a game with Vaněček in net. During his losing streak, this is how many goals they’ve scored in each game:\n\n1 @ San Jose (they also scored two before Karel Vejmelka got pulled)\n\nAll you can ask of a goalie is that he gives his team a chance to win — and for the most part, Vaněček has done that. But, as Calgary Flames goalie Dustin Wolf put it earlier in the season, “(Goalies) can’t generate offense.” They get pegged with win/loss stats, even though it’s a team game.\n\n“Tough situation, he didn’t play for a little bit and came in and the guys did not play their A game in front of him,” Utah coach Andre Tourigny said Sunday. “He kept us there. I think he did a great job.”\n\nIn two consecutive games, the Mammoth have been outshot and out-chanced.\n\nAgainst the St. Louis Blues on Friday, they controlled 43% of the scoring chances, per Natural Stat Trick. That number increased one percentage point against the Blue Jackets on Sunday.\n\nUtah managed 53% of the expected goals on Friday but receded to 33% on Sunday. The Mammoth took 45% of the shots against St. Louis and 42% against Columbus.\n\nThe bounces worked out in their favor on Friday, so they stole the win. They were lucky to get a point out of Sunday’s effort, but they can’t expect to succeed when they get outplayed.\n\n“(It’s) disappointing, the way we processed that game,” Tourigny said. “The way our thought process, mindset, our play with the puck, our play without the puck.\n\n“I think (Vaněček) gave us an opportunity to get a point, which is a big point, which is important. Thought, against St. Louis, (Karel Vejmelka) bailed us out, so I was expecting definitively better from today.”\n\nThe Blue Jackets’ effort is even more impressive considering they played almost the entire game with only five defensemen, as Denton Mateychuk left the game with an upper-body injury after his first shift.\n\nBlue Jackets coach Dean Evason praised his forwards after the game for supporting the defensemen so well.\n\n“We didn’t turn pucks over at the blue line. We knew we had to get pucks deep when we were a little bit tired, and we knew there were five guys back there,” he said.\n\n“We didn’t have to tell them. They were talking about it on the bench, or just saying let’s protect the D, get pucks deep and make sure that we get them off the ice.”\n\nThe Mammoth have points in four consecutive games, but the real test is about to start. They face the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday and the Dallas Stars on Thursday, two highly talented teams with ample playoff experience in recent years.\n\nMammoth captain Clayton Keller now has multiple points in three consecutive games. Everything the soon-to-be Olympian touches seems to go in (even if it has to bounce off someone’s shoulder to get there).\n\nThis was his 14th multi-point game of the season, and while he’s still not quite on pace to surpass his career high of 90 points, these multi-point games are helping the Mammoth immensely in their race for a playoff spot.\n\nKeller is the type of player who can single-handedly drag his team into the fight, even when things aren’t going well. He protects the puck well in the offensive zone, he has the ability to find passing lanes that no one else sees and he can really shoot the puck.\n\nAnd when his team wins, his fingerprints are all over it. That’s undoubtedly part of the reason Team USA picked him for the Olympic team and it’ll be part of any success the Mammoth have while he’s on the team.\n\nEvery hockey player in the world has heard the phrase from coaches on countless occasions: “Put it on net and good things happen.” That’s what Sergachev did here, and it paid off in the form of a goal.\n\nSergachev has become well-known for his “floaters” — long-range wrist shots that aren’t excessively powerful but seem to have the eyes to beat goalies. Sometimes they’re deflected in front, and other times they beat goalies cleanly.\n\nBut the goal was nothing out of the ordinary to Sergachev, who has routinely scored this way for years.\n\n“I got the puck, I saw an opening and I didn’t even look what was happening at the net. I knew our guys were there,” he said. “It just bounces off their guy and goes in. There’s nothing special about that goal.”\n\nUtah & Columbus are tied 2-2 after 40.\n\nThe Mammoth quickly jumped out to an early lead in the second but the Blue Jackets hung around and cashed in on a late power play.\n\nThird period on deck.pic.twitter.com/pdYS5pblxp\n\n— KSL Sports (@kslsports) January 12, 2026",

    "fullText": "There’s a chance the Manchester City Joie Stadium announcer meant nothing by it.\n\n“Our next home WSL match is against Chelsea. Come out and support us as we continue on our title challenge.”\n\nMaybe, as City fans left their seats after the 2-0 Women’s Super League (WSL) win over Everton, the short announcement failed to register. But it certainly felt like a development. Because at what point did we get here? When did City finally accept they are in a title race?\n\nThere’s a relief that comes with this territory for City, shaking off footballing politeness and slipping into those comfy only-for-home joggers. No more claims that no one looks at the WSL table; that all eyes are on the next game and nothing more.\n\nThe last time The Athletic analysed City’s title chances back in November, a mere point separated City from Chelsea. And while City were rightly sitting top, none of the top four looked convincing, which meant every fanbase barring Chelsea’s had consigned themselves to the notion that Chelsea would once again reign supreme.\n\nThat fatalism wasn’t without logic. The sight of former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes publicly waving the white flag to City live on Sky Sports in May 2024 after her side’s 4-3 defeat to Liverpool in May with a mere three league matches to go lives long in the memory — mostly for how she then seized that flag two weeks later, twirled it around her head and discoed goodbye to the WSL with Chelsea’s fifth title on the trot secured.\n\nSix points separated City and Chelsea then. Six points separate them now. But these six points feel more impervious for City who, since losing to Chelsea on the opening weekend, have won all 11 WSL matches.\n\nAs City prodded a stubborn defensive Everton shape that held Chelsea to their first WSL defeat under head coach Sonia Bompastor, there was no gurgling angst or arm flapping. This was 9-to-5 football, an administrative assistant filling out a tricky form. Everton goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan periodically got her hand in the way but it was nothing a little quality from an attack of Kerolin (who started her first WSL match of the season), Lauren Hemp, Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw and Vivianne Miedema can’t solve.\n\n“The most important thing for a player and for a team is self-confidence,” City head coach Andree Jeglertz said post-match. “That’s what you can see in this group right now. We know what we’re doing, we trust and believe in it. As long as we follow that, we’ll create scoring chances and win games.”\n\nThis has been part of City’s strength this season, as has their depth — something former manager Gareth Taylor neglected to build on, preferring a smaller, more intimate squad that often fell to injuries and exhaustion. This season, City are multi-faceted, helped in part by not playing in Europe while teams around them push squads to breaking point. But that hasn’t halted City from honing and adding. They are closing in on a deal to bring in USWNT midfielder Sam Coffey this window.\n\n“The key is no matter how many good players I have, there will always be room for them in this group,” Jeglertz said.\n\nIt is a kind of flex of depth more historically associated with peak Chelsea, along with other intangible virtues like defensive grit, attacking grind, and sharing goal-scoring responsibility. City still lead the WSL in number of goalscorers (12, followed by Chelsea with 11), despite having the most lethal goal guarantor at their disposal in Shaw. The Jamaica international boasts 12 goals, six more than her nearest Golden Boot rival (Aston Villa’s Kirsty Hanson) and seven more than any player from City’s title rivals.\n\nWhich begs the question, who is City’s title rival? Chelsea cut the most convincing figure capable of offering any kind of resistance. Chelsea travel to City on January 21 for the League Cup semi-final, then again on February 1 for the WSL. Their 5-0 thrashing of West Ham United on Sunday felt like a statement.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Manchester United or Arsenal much longer, both 10 and 11 points behind City respectively after their goalless draw on Saturday at the Emirates.\n\nThe game was microcosmic: Arsenal failing to make possession count; United valiantly organised like a tourniquet, more so when Jayde Riviere was sent off for a second caution, but never a thought as to how to make anyone else bleed. Neither team has claimed victory over a top-four side.\n\nThe consequence: a desperate scrapping for third place and a shot at Champions League football for the remaining months.\n\nThe implications of losing out sit heavily. Both clubs are engaged in crucial negotiations with current players, as well as potential summer signings. A failure to secure Champions League football would greatly impact the clubs.\n\nArsenal are aware of the wider infrastructure and hierarchical complications surrounding them, which The Athletic outlined here. Jodie Taylor’s appointment as technical director is a bid to improve the systems surrounding the team and deliver where they have been unable to since 2019.\n\nMarc Skinner’s side has bulked up with the arrivals of right-back Hanna Lundkvist from Hammarby and Germany forward Lea Schuller from Bayern. A pursuit for forward Ellen Wangerheim from Hammarby remains ongoing. But an impressive first season in the Champions League could end without it next season if United don’t capitalise on Arsenal’s league slip-ups. And who in United’s boardroom is taking a moment to pause, sweating over back fours and the definition of a head coach, to ensure they have a shot at taking advantage.\n\nFor now, the top-four race has been split in two: title contenders City chased by Chelsea, with Arsenal and United scrapping below so as not to be left behind.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "Here is an in-depth look at each team, from how their 2025 season went and what their salary cap and free agent situations look like to their draft capital and glaring needs.",
    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has begun, including for some of the league's most high-profile franchises.\n\nHere is an in-depth look at each team, from how their 2025 season went and what their salary cap and free agent situations look like to their draft capital and glaring needs.\n\nAFC East: Bills | Dolphins | Patriots | Jets \nAFC North: Ravens | Bengals | Browns | Steelers \nAFC South: Texans | Colts | Jaguars | Titans \nAFC West: Broncos | Chiefs | Raiders | Chargers \nNFC East: Cowboys | Giants | Eagles | Commanders \nNFC North: Bears | Lions | Packers | Vikings \nNFC South: Falcons | Panthers | Saints | Buccaneers \nNFC West: Cardinals | Rams | 49ers | Seahawks\n\n(Click the team name for the full preview.)\n\nThe Dolphins will start completely fresh with a new regime as the team fired head coach Mike McDaniel. At first, it seemed as if McDaniel might have done enough over the second half of the season to keep his job, thanks to an improved run game and the team never appearing to quit despite the rough start. Miami now has a chance to pivot from McDaniel’s Tua-centric style of offense, but due to the significant investment in that approach, it might not be a quick or easy path out.\n\nThe Jets are hoping that this timeline will mirror the Detroit Lions, where Aaron Glenn came from as defensive coordinator. Detroit went 3-13-1 in Dan Campbell’s first season before a 9-8 record in Year 2. Though unlike the Lions, the Jets will need to find a quarterback. Justin Fields was signed to potentially be that player, but he lasted until only Week 11 before he was replaced. With a ton of draft capital and salary cap space, 2025 could be seen as more of a Year 0 for the Jets and this regime.\n\nMany of the bones that made the Ravens a Super Bowl contender are still in place, headlined by quarterback Lamar Jackson. But Baltimore now has another offseason of figuring out what went wrong. Only this time, it comes much earlier than anticipated with a few more questions that need to be answered — including, for the first time in 18 years, what comes next at head coach after the Ravens fired John Harbaugh.\n\nAfter another disappointing, injury-ridden year, the Bengals will keep Zac Taylor as head coach and Duke Tobin as de facto general manager and try to figure out how to build out a defense and more offensive structure around their three best players, Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.\n\nThis Browns’ season was never going to be about success in 2025. Cleveland seemingly hit on many of the non-quarterback 2025 draft picks — tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger will be top contenders for Rookie of the Year on each side of the ball, if not outright winners — while the Browns picked up a ton of future draft capital, entering the 2026 draft with two first-round picks. Kevin Stefanski is out as head coach, but general manager Andrew Berry will stay on to oversee what the next era of the Browns might be.\n\nIt would have been nearly impossible to think the Colts’ 2025 season would end up here after how it started. The Colts were first in point differential through the first 10 weeks of the season, and 28th from Week 12 on. With Daniel Jones injured and signed to only a one-year deal, plus having no first-round pick, the Colts find themselves in a much tougher offseason situation than anyone could have imagined midway through November.\n\nIt’s impossible to overstate the success of the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first year of head coach Liam Coen. Thirteen wins and an AFC South title are more than most Jacksonville fans could have imagined, even at some points during this regular season. The Jakobi Meyers trade allowed all the offensive pieces to fall into place while Trevor Lawrence ranked fourth in EPA per play and third in success rate from Week 11 until the end of the regular season. The Jaguars were third in weighted DVOA by the time the season ended. Jacksonville got the most out of its talent and it still feels like there’s more to come. A Year 1 couldn’t be much better and expectations are sky-high for Year 2.\n\nThe Titans had hope after drafting QB Cam Ward with the first overall draft pick in 2025, but things never completely came together. Ward flashed, but a lack of talent, especially at receiver, kept Tennessee’s offense from finding its stride. Head coach Brian Callahan was fired after Week 6 with a 1-5 record, 3-14 overall in two seasons with the Titans. Now, Tennessee will search for the next head coach in an attempt to get the most out of Ward and build up a roster that has a young offense while featuring one of the oldest defenses in the league by snap-weighted age.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this season might have been just a small step back for a perennial Super Bowl contender — a chance to regroup and go again. But given Travis Kelce’s age and the late-season ACL tear for Patrick Mahomes, and now grave domestic violence allegations against Rashee Rice, this feels like a bigger moment — the end of an era of this version of the Chiefs. It might not be, but for the first time in the Mahomes era, the Chiefs don’t feel inevitable. This offseason will be the first and an important step in trying to get that feeling back.\n\nThe 2025 Chargers’ season was an objective success. But it feels like they left so much on the table.Justin Herbert was incredible throughout the season, but couldn’t get the production to match. The Chargers lost both starting tackles in Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater, while the team had nine offensive line combinations that played at least 50 snaps together. This also felt like a missed opportunity for a defense that was seventh in weighted DVOA by the end of the season. Coordinator Jesse Minter could become a head coach elsewhere, which would force the Chargers into a defensive reset.\n\nAs good as Dak Prescott and the offense were, the Cowboys were one of the league’s worst defenses the entire season and ultimately fired coordinator Matt Eberflus. Due to the struggles, Dallas traded for Quinnen Williams at the deadline. Williams is a fantastic player and immediately made an impact for the Cowboys, but it cost a 2026 second-round draft pick, leaving Dallas with no Day 2 picks this year, and a single 2027 first-round pick. The offense wasn’t enough to make up for the defensive deficiencies and the Cowboys missed the playoffs in a season when playoff spots felt more wide open than ever.\n\nFor the third straight season, the Giants are looking at a top-six pick in the draft. While some of the young talent was tantalizing, the Giants didn’t have close to a full competitive roster. After going 2-8 this past season, Brian Daboll was fired as head coach. The Giants now need a new head coach, and have decided general manager Joe Schoen will stick around.\n\nThis was not the world-beating team so many expected to see after last year’s Super Bowl title. How the Eagles played in games was telling. In 2024, they were 24th in points per drive on their opening possession, but improved to fifth over the rest of the game. The 2025 Eagles were sixth in points per drive on their opening possession, but dropped to 25th on all following drives. The talent is still overwhelming. That was the case with a defense that was still second in EPA per play while developing multiple All-Pro-caliber players. But, also as the defense proved, this team needs to figure out how to make that talent work together instead of just relying on the talent to carry itself.\n\nAfter a season when everything broke right for the Commanders, just about everything went wrong in 2025. Last season, Washington went 7-2 in games decided by seven points or fewer. The Commanders were 0-5 in those games this past season. Washington finished the season in the bottom five of defensive DVOA. Now defensive coordinator Joe Whitt and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury are not coming back next season. While the Commanders still have the bones of the impressive 2024 team — and a likely healthy Jayden Daniels set to return — this is a franchise that will have to step back and retool a bit earlier than expected.\n\nA 9-8 record is disappointing given where the Lions had been, but this is still a team that finished third in DVOA — it was not a total disaster. Detroit finished third in yards per play on offense, though there were times when the limits of Jared Goff as a quarterback were more exposed than in years past. A shaky offense forced Campbell to take over play-calling in the middle of the season and the Lions will look for a new offensive coordinator in the offseason. The Lions still had the eighth-best point differential in the league, better than NFC playoff teams such as the 49ers, Eagles, Packers, Bears and Panthers. It’s hardly a consolation prize, but this team is still on the right track.\n\nSlowly and surely, injuries chipped away at what made the 2025 Packers special. Tucker Kraft’s torn ACL in Week 8 eliminated the offense’s biggest weapon, a man-beater and yards-after-the-catch monster. Then, a torn ACL for Micah Parsons in Week 15 sapped the hope that Green Bay’s defense could cause enough chaos to lead the way. Those pillar pieces will return in 2026, which should again make the Packers one of the top contenders in the NFL. But after another disappointing early playoff exit, 2026 might need to be the season when the results actually follow. With a potential salary cap crunch and no first-round draft pick, the Packers are going to have to hope the players already put in place can be as good as they need to be in the long term.\n\nExpectations were high for the Vikings coming off a 14-win season in 2024. However, the main goal of 2025 was to get as much information as possible on quarterback J.J. McCarthy. Minnesota disappointed and also did not get a clear evaluation of McCarthy as a quarterback. Despite that, the Vikings still finished above their win total and over .500. That was mostly thanks to a Brian Flores defense that ranked third in DVOA. Flores is a free agent, who could be hired elsewhere as a head coach or defensive coordinator. If most of the pieces stay in place, the Vikings remain a well-structured team that is just average quarterback play away from contending.\n\nThe Falcons won the final game of the regular season to reach a three-way tie in record at the top of the NFC South. But Atlanta’s win sent Carolina to the playoffs, while the Falcons officially finished third in the division and fired head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot. The issue with Atlanta over the past two seasons was a clear misevaluation of where the team was and how to build the roster around it. A four-game win streak wasn’t enough to salvage the season. Neither were the individual bright spots, like Drake London and Bijan Robinson. Even the defense impressed in stretches, but it was never enough to make the Falcons feel like a franchise with a coherent plan and path forward.\n\nAn 8-9 record might not feel like a win, but some offensive competence and competitive games would have been the goal heading into the season, and that’s what Carolina got. There are more building blocks in place than there were last season, and this is still one of the youngest teams in the league by snap-weighted age. There might not be a clear answer about the long-term potential of Bryce Young, who finished the regular season 28th in EPA per play, but there have been enough high marks that the team could feel comfortable getting one more season to figure it out. The Panthers sit at a much better spot than they did coming off last year’\n\nFraming the 2025 season as a success for the Saints would be a stretch, but there’s a lot more to like than would meet the eye. First-year head coach Kellen Moore laid a solid foundation for his offense, and the Saints’ defense reached the top half of the league in DVOA under coordinator Brandon Staley. Tyler Shough was 22nd among quarterbacks in EPA per play but was in the top 10 over the final five weeks of the regular season, when the Saints went 4-1.\n\nThe Bucs were 6-2 at their Week 9 bye and wound up missing the playoffs. There was a lot of attention given to Baker Mayfield’s dropoff after the bye, but the Bucs went from 13th in EPA per play to only 18th. However, Tampa Bay dropped from sixth in EPA per play on defense before the bye — aided by a strong run defense — to 28th post-bye. The Bucs can hope that better health leads to more success in 2026, but there should be some reflection on what went wrong and what needs to be fixed to keep the franchise moving forward. The Bucs have decided to retain head coach Todd Bowles, though they fired offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard, QB coach Thad Lewis and special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey.\n\nOffensively, things never clicked. Kyler Murray was in and out of the lineup with injuries, which ultimately ended his season early. Now there are big questions about his future with the franchise. There were bright spots on defense, like rookie cornerback Denzel Burke and free-agent signing Josh Sweat, but injuries hamstrung this team all over. Jonathan Gannon was let go as head coach after three seasons, none of them over .500, and a 15-36 record.",

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Ranking the nine teams left in 2026 playoffs, from Seahawks to Steelers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL playoff field started with 14 teams. With five of six wild-card games in the books, it's down to a fine nine ahead of the Steelers hosting the Texans in Pittsburgh for the wild weekend finale on Monday night.\n\nThere were some classic shootouts and games that came down to the wire and three was the unlucky seed number with both the Eagles and Jaguars being upset at home on Sunday.\n\nWith the two top-seeded bye teams prepping for playoff action and the NFC and AFC conference games almost set, here's an updated comparison of the teams still alive to win Super Bowl 60:\n\nThe Seahawks won a tough NFC West from which the Rams and their opponents, the 49ers, also made the divisional round. They have a dominant defense, balanced and explosive offense and are well coached by Mike Macdonald and Klint Kubiak. They should be ready for the rubber match with San Francisco after losing to the 49ers at home in Week 1. The key is Sam Darnold and the entire team avoiding lingering turnover issues.\n\nThe Patriots showed they were a complete and playoff-tough team under Mike Vrabel when their offense was contained by the Chargers. Drake Maye still overcame some tough pressure and made the plays when they counted most. The defense also sent a strong message with a dominant start in the wild-card round. They are looking like the steady playoff winner they used to be with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\n\nMORE: How Drake Maye overcame turnovers to beat Chargers\n\nThe Broncos will get a tough draw against the Bills, but then again Buffalo's offense has hit snags when Josh Allen faces top pressure and coverage defenses on the road. Denver's defense will need to set the tone at home, where Bo Nix tends to lead the offense best. The Broncos will see the Patriots as expected in the AFC championship game as long as they don't get off to too slow of a start and play catchup to the Bills.\n\nThe Rams' defense has a lot of potential with its run stopping, pressure and coverage, but it has its share of holes. The good news, they got a rough game out of their system against the Panthers.\n\nMatthew Stafford and Puka Nacua kept sizzling and trying to pass well enough to outscore them is a real challenge. With L.A. getting over an early scare, it should be refocused to rebound stronger for the divisional round.\n\nMORE: Three problems Sean McVay, Rams must fix after beating Panthers\n\nThe Bills got over a massive playoff obstacle in Josh Allen's first road wild-card game by outlasting the tough Jaguars by making fewer mistakes in the clutch, leading to a 27-24 fourth-quarter escape. In the divisional round, Allen will look up and see no Chiefs, Ravens or Bengals still in the AFC playoff mix.\n\nAllen has proved to be the great postseason equalizer and then some when their running game and defense are off. He should be the most trusted big-play and clutch QB left in the field.\n\nMORE: Three reasons why Bills passed their toughest test vs. Jags\n\nThe Bears seem to keep living dangerously as the worst total defense in the playoffs and have been too dependent on getting key takeaways. It had to feel good that they could win a game when four fumbles by the Packers didn't go their way and had zero interceptions from Jordan Love.\n\nIt would be nice for Ben Johnson  if Caleb Williams and the offense to start faster instead of waiting to explode while exploiting the best passing game matchups in the fourth quarter. Getting the league's No. 3 rushing offense going early would help. They will be ready to be better all-around after getting valuable playoff experience to take down their archrivals at home.\n\nMORE: How Caleb Williams made Bears' history in comeback victory over Packers\n\nThe 49ers took out the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles in Philadelphia with a gritty shorthanded defensive performance for the ages. They also had to adjust to yet another big offensive injury to George Kittle, grinding away with Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey with great playoff scheming by Kyle Shanahan. They might not have enough health in their favor to get to another Super Bowl, but their experience can't be ignored in a still wide-open field.\n\nMORE: Christian Mcaffrey shines with 2 TDs in upset victory over Eagles\n\nThe Texans have won playoff games in each of the previous two trips with C.J. Stroud at quarterback under DeMeco Ryans. They draw a tough even matchup against the low-scoring, defensive-minded Steelers on Monday night. They will need to get hot offensively and score more to advance and have a shot against the Patriots on the road.\n\nThe Steelers are hoping that Aaron Rodgers can have some throwback magic left in him at 41 with DK Metcalf returning to raise the big-play potential for their QB's still strong arm. But equal keys is finding a consistent running game and much improving the defensive communication. It might be asking too much for the Steelers to win ugly more than once.",

    "title": "Noise sensitivity disrupts the mind, brain and body",
    "description": "Though noise sensitivity is often dismissed by doctors, it can have long-term effects on our mental and physical health.",
    "fullText": "Though noise sensitivity is often dismissed by doctors, it can have long-term effects on our mental and physical health.\n\nTap, tap, tap. Tap, tap, tap. There it was again: the incessant noise from my new upstairs neighbours, evidently still in the process of hanging up pictures or cobbling together new furniture. In my well-insulated building in central Berlin, the noise was well below decibels that would irritate anyone else. But it sent me into a rage.\n\nA tight sensation of stress rushed through my body. Even worse was the anxiety: \"When will they ever be finished?\"\n\nThat's not the only noise that is bothering me. I notice the soft thudding across my ceilings as people get ready for bed. Somewhere in the building, I hear the high-pitched hum of a vacuum cleaner and the muffled thumping of a washing machine. The neighbour's dachshund yapping for a treat. And don't get me started on the leaf blowers and pressure washers outside. Noise – however slight – breaks my concentration and peace of mind.\n\nIt is fair to say that I – along with 10% to 40% of the general population – am noise-sensitive, meaning that I feel more upset and disturbed by noise than the average person. It would be easy to dismiss noise sensitivity as a personality flaw, a symptom of generally being belligerent, whiny, and irritable. But, in recent years, scientists have learned that it has real biological roots. The brains of noise-sensitive people respond differently to sound and some may actually be born that way. What's more, it affects not only people's immediate mood but also their long-term mental and physical health. While there are few easy solutions, being aware of these effects can help noise-sensitive people take action to make their lives more tolerable.\n\n\"It's been one of those what we might call a wastepaper basket sort of issues… that just gets pushed away by health professionals,\" says neuroscientist Daniel Shepherd of Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand. Only in recent years \"have people actually really started to say, right, this is at an experiential level really impacting patients\", he adds. \"We really need to actually start getting a handle on this.\"\n\nNoise sensitivity isn't a formal medical diagnosis. People can find out if they're noise sensitive by taking questionnaires like the 21-question Weinstein's noise sensitivity scale (which asks, for instance, if you're bothered by people whispering and crinkling sweet wrappers in a movie theatre, if you get mad at people making noise when you're trying to sleep or work, even if the sound of music bothers you if you're trying to concentrate.)\n\nNoise sensitivity is different from other sound-related conditions like misophonia. This is a specific decreased tolerance to certain sounds, like chewing, throat-clearing, tapping or ticking, which trigger intense feelings of disgust or rage, explains Jennifer Brout, a clinician and the founder of the US-based International Misophonia Research Network. Noise sensitivity is also different from hyperacusis, where people feel pain or extreme discomfort because they perceive sounds more loudly than they actually are.\n\nNoise sensitivity, by contrast, is a general reactiveness to all sounds, regardless of how loud they're perceived or how loud they actually are. At the very least, noise-sensitive people find sound disruptive and become annoyed, angry, or even fearful or anxious. \"I remember a person describing it like having a mosquito flying around you,\" Shepherd says. \"You just can't not attend to it.\"\n\nFor those who are afraid of noise, the condition might make them so stressed that their bodies go into a fight-or-flight response. \"Your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure goes up,\" says Stephen Stansfeld, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nSleep quality can also take a hit. In one 2021 study, researchers tracked the sleeping patterns of 500 adults in China and nighttime noise levels over the course of a week. They found that, while the noise itself didn't affect people's sleep quality, noise-sensitive individuals tended to find their sleep less restorative, rating their sleep as less refreshing and saying they felt moodier and had less energy during the day.\n\nNoise exposure has also been linked to a range of long-term health effects, including heart disease and diabetes – and noise-sensitive people may suffer the most from  mental health impacts, Stansfeld says. In one 2021 study, Stansfeld and his colleagues surveyed 2,398 men in the Welsh town of Caerphilly who were exposed to different levels of road traffic noise. Those who were noise-sensitive were more likely to have long-term anxiety and depression.\n\nWhile that may be partly because anxious people are more vigilant about their surroundings and therefore more likely to notice noise, it's also possible that being noise sensitive can worsen anxiety. And, one 2023 survey of 1,244 adults living near airports in France found that people severely annoyed by aircraft noise levels – especially some noise-sensitive individuals – were more likely to rate their general health as poor.\n\nBut why do some people react more negatively to noise than others? Studies on the brains of noise-sensitive people reveal some clues. When Shepherd and his colleagues hooked people up to devices that measured the electrical activity in their brains, those without noise sensitivity only showed heightened activity when the researchers played them threatening sounds. But in noise-sensitive people, \"their brains tend to go up the gears irrespective of the sound, whether it's a threatening sound or a non-threatening sound\", Shepherd recalls.\n\nBoth Shepherd and the neuroscientist Elvira Brattico of Denmark's Aarhus University have independently found evidence that this has to do with how the brain filters out information about unimportant sounds. Shepherd's team found evidence that in noise-sensitive people, a specific clump of cells within the medial geniculate nucleus – a relay station for sound information entering the brain – are less efficient at this filtering task compared to the brains of those without the condition.\n\nWhere most people can \"filter this information out and get on with life, those who have noise sensitivity don't do it as easily\", he says. This kind of filtering also seems to be important during sleep. While most people show patterns of electrical activity called spindles as they fall asleep, which are thought to be important in getting used to surrounding noise, people with noise-sensitivity have less of them – helping explain why they stay so reactive to sounds that normal people aren't bothered by.\n\nHow brains end up this way, though, is a mystery. One Finnish study on twins suggests that noise sensitivity is often heritable, so some people might be predisposed to have it from birth. But it's also possible that people living in noisy environments develop sensitivity over time, Brattico says.\n\nPeople with anxiety, schizophrenia and autism are especially likely to develop noise sensitivity. While some people can get it after suffering traumatic brain injuries, for most it's usually something that persists over a lifetime, Stansfeld says. \"It is very difficult, as compared to someone who's not noise-sensitive, to actually habituate to sound and actually desensitise to it.\"\n\nThe ideal solution, of course, would be to tackle the sources of noise themselves. Urban planners could build quiet inner courtyards for residential buildings, use rubberised asphalt ingredients that reduce traffic noise, or erect sound-diffracting walls around highways and noisy areas like highways. Some cities in Belgium and France have already begun implementing such measures, as well as reducing vehicle speed limits, encouraging bike infrastructure and creating quiet zones in parks and along rivers. While noise is a real cause of health problems, \"it's also one which is potentially avoidable\", Stansfeld says.\n\nBut progress is slow, leaving many noise-sensitive people to fend for themselves – for instance by avoiding noisy areas, soundproofing their living spaces or turning to earplugs, earmuffs or noise-cancelling headphones. But these methods often just dampen sounds rather than removing them altogether. \"Even quiet noises might be annoying to a noise-sensitive person,\" Brattico says.\n\n• How traffic noise hurts children's brains\n\n• Why noise pollution is hurting your heart\n\n• The rise of highly sensitive parents\n\nSometimes, treating underlying conditions like anxiety with medications may help, Stansfeld says. Cognitive behavioural therapy, a kind of talking therapy that centres on managing one's psychological reactions and behaviours, can make sense in settings where people are afraid of noise. \"I treated somebody myself with cognitive behaviour therapy, and I think it could be quite helpful,\" Stansfeld says.\n\nMeanwhile, Brattico believes that music therapy with qualified practitioners could also be useful, which involves selecting soothing, soft music that calms people and builds positive associations with sound. For those wanting to try self-soothing, Brattico recommends music with few, soft instruments like piano or harp, such as Renaissance or Baroque chamber music. When even music is annoying, art therapy might help – \"something that's relaxing and allows expressions and regulation of emotions\", Brattico says.\n\nAs for myself, it was earplugs, jazz-playing noise-cancelling headphones and a towel wrapped around my head, that eventually helped somewhat. Until the world around me becomes quieter, I can at least try to find some peace in my own mind.\n\nIf you liked this story, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "description": "Discover some of ChatGPT's recommendations for alternatives to gold -- like silver, defensive stocks and bonds -- for safety during economic uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Gold saw great growth in 2025. It’s not surprising, as investors often turn to gold during times of economic uncertainty. With the expectations of the U.S. dollar weakening and slower growth, more people turn to a safe-haven investment like gold, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nGold prices may be too steep for some investors, leaving them looking for other suitable investments for relative safety. For investors concerned about inflation or market volatility, stability and inflation hedges can be found elsewhere. GOBankingRates asked ChatGPT for the best alternatives to investing in gold. Here’s what the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recommended as some gold alternatives.\n\nAlso see four reasons for gold’s popularity in 2025 and how to protect your portfolio.\n\nGold isn’t the only precious metal retail investors can purchase. Silver, platinum and palladium are all legitimate alternative investments to buy. Think of these precious metals as cousins to gold but with their unique profiles.\n\n“These metals can benefit from both investment demand and industrial use, which gives them a different performance profile than gold,” ChatGPT said. “All three metals tend to be riskier than investing in gold, but they do provide some upside. Silver tends to be more volatile, but it can outperform gold during strong economic periods due to industrial demand. Platinum and palladium are rarer and more heavily tied to automotive production, which adds risk but also potential upside.”\n\nHaving a small portion of your portfolio in these metals can add helpful diversification.\n\nRead Next: 3 Safest Investments To Hold In The Current Trump Economy\n\nCheck Out: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n\nOwning stocks can still be a wise choice for cautious investors, given the right circumstances. Growth stocks may be too risky, but defensive stocks can provide some protection. Defensive stocks typically have a strong history of dividend growth, minimal debt and an inexpensive valuation, according to Kiplinger.\n\nIn short, companies that sell items people always use are often defensive. “Firms in defensive sectors like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples sell products people need regardless of economic conditions,” ChatGPT explained.\n\nDefensive means dependable, not boring, and that dependability can create generous dividend growth.\n\nGold investors often value tangible assets they can see. Land, such as farmland or real estate, could be an alternative to gold for the right investor. “These assets are less liquid and can require more management, but they often move independently of traditional financial markets,” the AI said.",

    "fullText": "Republican Senator Rand Paul says President Donald Trump is shooting himself in the foot with his aggressive posturing towards Greenland.\n\nTrump has escalated his threats to take over the mineral-rich island, telling reporters Friday, “We are going to do something in Greenland, whether they like it or not.” The 79-year-old president said he would “do it the hard way” if he couldn’t strike a deal to acquire the territory.\n\nOn Sunday, Paul warned that Trump’s “denigrating” saber-rattling is backfiring by alienating GOP lawmakers in Washington and people in Greenland.\n\n“Let’s say you wanted to buy Greenland—and I’m not disputing that that might be something we might want,” the 63-year-old Kentucky senator said on ABC News’s This Week. “You don’t get there by angering and denigrating the people who live there and saying, ‘We’re going to march the Marines in and take it if you don’t sell it to us.’ It doesn’t make them very willing to sell to us.”\n\nPaul continued, “So really, if your goal is somehow we’re going to rattle the saber, then they’re going to sell it to us, I think it’s having the opposite effect. I think you’d be hard-pressed to find someone in Greenland for it, but you’d also be hard-pressed to find somebody in Washington who’s for a military invasion on either side of the aisle.”\n\nThe senator, one of the few Republicans who regularly challenges Trump, appears to be correct.\n\nGreenland’s party leaders issued a joint statement Friday night rejecting Trump in response to his latest assertions that the U.S. “needs” the island, a semi-autonomous territory within the Danish kingdom, and his refusal to rule out the use of military force.\n\n“We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people,” the statement said. “We would like to emphasize once again our wish that the United States’ contempt for our country ends.”\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has also rebuked Trump, reminding him that the U.S. has “no legal basis to annex” the territory.\n\nIn Congress, several GOP lawmakers, including Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, and Maine Senator Susan Collins, have openly condemned talk of the U.S. taking over Greenland.\n\nPaul, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CBS Mornings last week that U.S. military action “won’t happen under my watch.”\n\n“I will do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland,” he said.\n\nABC News’s Martha Raddatz asked Paul on Sunday, “Do you actually think he would use military force, or are we overreacting to that?”\n\n“I would hope not,” Paul replied, reiterating his belief that Congress should decide if the military is deployed, whether in Greenland, Venezuela, or Colombia.\n\n“It’s about whether or not the people get a say in whether we go to war,” added the senator, who was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act last week. The resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nA White House official previously told the Daily Beast that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.”",

    "description": "\"It was such a special moment.\"",
    "fullText": "Wild beavers were hunted to extinction in England in the early 16th century. However, a trail camera has now captured a wild beaver in Norfolk.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the camera spotted the beaver dragging materials to build its lodge on the River Wensum at Pensthorpe, a nature reserve near Fakenham in Norfolk.\n\nThough beavers began making a comeback in the English countryside around a decade ago, this marks the first sighting of a wild beaver in this area.\n\nThe nature reserve's manager, Richard Spowage, told The Guardian, \"No one knows where it's come from, but it's found what I consider a perfect beaver habitat.\"\n\nBeavers are known as nature's architects due to their engineering of landscapes through the creation of ponds, dams, and channels that mitigate flooding, soil erosion, and drought.\n\nResearchers from the University of Connecticut even discovered that they help replenish groundwater. As groundwater aids in refreshing streams during hot, dry seasons, this makes the animals' work vital.\n\nSpowage had an inkling that a beaver was somewhere on the reserve after he saw \"classic beaver chips\" along the base of a tree. This led him to set up camera traps in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the creature.\n\nThe use of such cameras by wildlife authorities is one of the best ways to document wildlife, especially rare and elusive species that prefer to remain hidden, as this technology simplifies documentation.\n\nAdditionally, cameras are safer and less stressful for wildlife, as no direct human interaction is required. This lack of interaction also allows wildlife to continue engaging in natural behaviors, which can help inform conservation efforts.\n\nFor example, cameras captured footage of one of the world's most elusive felines in the Andes in South America, for which conservation groups had waited three years to see. Although sightings of the Andean wild cat have occurred only 10 times in the past 25 years, this video allowed conservationists to continue monitoring the animal without disrupting it.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWildlife cameras also allow experts to monitor the health of endangered species populations to assess how conservation and rehabilitation efforts are going, making them invaluable for smart wildlife management.\n\nCameras like this also create hope in the power of conservation efforts. As Spowage explained to The Guardian, \"It was such a special moment to see it out there, living its life, after not being seen in Norfolk for hundreds of years.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Because it’s never too early in the day to show your heart some love!",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Mandy Enright, M.S., RDN, RYT\n\nThe best breakfast for high blood pressure is high in protein, fiber and leafy greens.\n\nProtein and fiber help keep blood sugar steady, which in turn affects blood pressure.\n\nLeafy greens like spinach provide dietary nitrates that improve blood flow and circulation.\n\nBreakfast can be an easy way to start the day with nutrients your body needs to feel and function well. A balanced morning meal helps provide fiber, protein and key vitamins and minerals that support steady energy and overall health. Research suggests that people who eat breakfast regularly often have healthier eating habits and may be less likely to have high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.\n\nTo find out the best breakfast for better blood pressure and heart health, we reached out to Michael Twyman, M.D. He stresses the importance of eating a breakfast rich in protein, fiber and dietary nitrates from dark leafy greens. These nutrients help prevent blood glucose spikes and insulin resistance, which both contribute to elevated blood pressure. And this Spinach & Egg Scramble with Raspberries checks all the boxes.\n\nSpinach & Egg Scramble with Raspberries is a smart way to support healthy blood pressure first thing in the day. Protein-rich eggs help you feel satisfied, while fiber from whole-grain toast and raspberries supports steadier blood sugar and appetite control. Spinach adds potassium and other nutrients that play a role in blood vessel function.\n\nTogether, this protein-, fiber- and leafy green-packed breakfast delivers lasting energy without weighing you down, making it easier to stay fueled and make heart-healthy choices all morning.\n\n“Blood pressure is a complex interaction of various forces,” says Twyman. Of course, there’s nutrition, but timing matters too. “Most people should eat their largest meal of the day in the morning and ideally within one hour of sunrise,” he says.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s Twyman’s easy formula for a blood pressure-lowering breakfast.\n\n“Protein is important for muscle synthesis, so shoot for at least 30 grams of protein at your first meal of the day,” says Twyman. What does muscle have to do with blood pressure? One study showed that greater lean muscle mass is associated with a lower risk of hypertension. However, if you really want to build more muscle, you’ll need to add in resistance training. So, be sure to include a couple of strength-training sessions in your weekly exercise routine.\n\nThis recipe supplies 18 grams of protein. But if you want to hit that 30-gram target, you can add 2 large eggs. You may be thinking, “Wait! Don’t I need to worry about how many eggs I’m eating if I’m trying to be mindful of heart health?” Yes, eggs contain cholesterol (about 200 milligrams per large egg).  However, “dietary cholesterol does not raise serum cholesterol, so don't worry about the cholesterol content of eggs,” Twyman explains.\n\nWhat about saturated fat? “Some people are more sensitive to a diet high in saturated fat, so monitor your lipids with routine blood work to see if you are susceptible,” recommends Twyman.\n\nBut most of us don’t need to worry. While eggs contain some saturated fat, they have less than you might expect. In fact, one whole large egg only has 1.6 grams of saturated fat, which isn’t much if your overall diet is pretty low in saturated fat, to begin with. However, if you’re still concerned, you can use egg whites for protein without the saturated fat or opt to add nonfat strained (Greek-style) yogurt or kefir instead of additional eggs.\n\nRemember that complex interaction of forces that impact blood pressure that Twyman mentioned? Blood glucose is one of them. So, avoiding glucose spikes and preventing insulin resistance is key.\n\nHere’s why: Chronically high blood sugar can cause endothelial damage, meaning your blood vessels cannot function properly. And for people living with diabetes, high blood sugar levels make it difficult for the body to produce nitric oxide, an important vasodilator that opens up the blood vessels, allowing blood to flow easily. Over time, this may lead to elevated blood pressure.\n\nThe good news is eating a breakfast that’s high in fiber slows digestion and helps prevent blood glucose spikes. Pairing fiber with protein balances your breakfast and makes it even more effective.\n\n“Foods high in dietary nitrates, like dark leafy greens and beets, provide the body with compounds that help produce nitric oxide,” says Twyman. Studies show that loss of nitric oxide production is one of the first steps in the development of hypertension.\n\nIncluding spinach in your breakfast scramble is an easy way to increase your intake of dietary nitrates. But if spinach isn’t your thing, you can also get plenty of blood pressure–lowering nitrates in your diet from arugula, Swiss chard, basil, parsley, radishes, bok choy and beets.\n\nIf you could use some ideas to add more blood pressure–supporting nutrients to your morning, try these tasty breakfast recipes:\n\nBlack Beans, Rice & Fried Egg. This winning combo of eggs and black beans delivers 19 grams of protein and 11 grams of fiber. Then spinach provides those dietary nitrates that help open your blood vessels for optimal blood flow. Using leftover cooked brown rice is an easy way to get this breakfast on the table fast. Canned beans and prewashed baby spinach are also huge timesavers.\n\nSpanakopita Breakfast Sandwiches. A breakfast sandwich is a tasty, convenient way to work nitrate-rich greens into your morning. Here, you’ll get a double shot courtesy of wilted spinach and arugula. This sandwich also provides 15 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber.\n\nBreakfast Salad with Smoked Salmon & Poached Eggs. A big bowl of greens is a fantastic way to work in those nitrates. But the blood pressure benefits of this breakfast don’t stop there. Smoked salmon provides a healthy dose of omega-3 fats, another key nutrient for lower blood pressure. This bowl also boasts 15 grams of protein plus 6 grams of fiber.\n\nBreakfast Beans with Microwave-Poached Egg. In Costa Rica, this popular breakfast bean dish, called gallo pinto, traditionally calls for rice. For extra fiber, we sub in cooked barley. But feel free to use whatever leftover cooked whole grain you have on hand. In addition to 10 grams of fiber, you’ll also score 16 grams of protein.\n\nAs rich in protein as these meals are, you may have noticed they don’t hit that magical 30-gram number. Not to worry. Round out your meal with a single-serve container of nonfat plain Greek yogurt for an easy 16 grams of additional high-quality protein, plus calcium and potassium, two minerals that also promote healthy blood pressure.\n\nA healthy, balanced breakfast can do great things for your heart health and your blood pressure. For a cardiologist-approved morning meal, aim for a combo of protein, fiber and leafy greens, like Spinach & Egg Scramble with Raspberries. Its protein and fiber prevent blood sugar spikes and support metabolic health. Plus, its protein helps maintain lean muscle mass, which may also reduce your risk of high blood pressure. For an extra dose of protection, leafy green spinach delivers blood pressure–lowering nitrates plus additional fiber. Now, that’s what we call a recipe for heart health!",

The Wall Street Journal reported Beijing has also begun restricting rare-earth exports ⁠to Japan more broadly.\n\nJapan has condemned China's dual-use ban but declined ‌to comment on the report of a broader ban, which China has not confirmed or denied.

In 2010, China held back exports following an incident near disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nSince then, Japan has reduced its reliance on China to 60% from 90% by investing in overseas projects like trading house Sojitz's tie-up with Australia's Lynas Rare Earths, and promoting rare-earths recycling and manufacturing processes that rely less on ​the minerals.\n\nThe Minamitori Island project, however, is the first to attempt to source rare earths domestically.\n\n\"The fundamental solution is to be able to produce rare earths inside Japan,\" said ‌Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.\n\n\"If this new round of export controls ends up covering a lot of rare earths, Japanese companies will again make efforts to move away from China, but I don’t think it will be easy,\" he said.",

Gold, seen as a haven investment, rose as much as 2%.\n\nFollowing Powell's statement, Trump denied having any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the central bank.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" Trump said of Powell in an interview with NBC News Sunday night.\n\nThe $2.5 billion planned headquarters renovations have become a major talking point for White House officials, who have accused Powell of overspending and breaking oversight laws.\n\nIn July, Trump said that Powell's actions were \"sort of\" grounds for dismissal but later said he was \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell, unless it was for \"fraud.\" Powell has defended the renovations.\n\nTrump has urged the Federal Reserve — an independent government agency — to lower interest rates as part of his plan to spur the American economy.\n\nIn its December meeting, the Fed cut rates to a range of 3.5%—3.75%, following similar reductions in September and October. After the meeting, Trump called Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"a stiff\" who approved a \"rather small\" cut and said the cut could have been \"at least doubled.\"\n\nThe president has also targeted Lisa Cook, a Fed governor. In August, he asked her to resign immediately due to allegations that Cook had committed illicit activity related to two mortgage loans. In September, a federal judge ruled that Cook can keep her job at the central bank for now.\n\nThe DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to the DOJ.",

    "fullText": "Hearing about restaurant closures has become increasingly common, but the news often hits the hardest when long-standing establishments shut their doors. These restaurants represent far more than just places to eat; many have become prominent pieces of their communities, tied to years of memories and local traditions.\n\nEven well-established chains have not been immune to this troublesome trend. In recent years, several major restaurant brands have undergone mass closures, with some even filing for bankruptcy, as rising costs and mounting debt have made it difficult for them to continue operating.\n\nFounded in 1972, Houlihan's is a casual American restaurant and bar chain that once had a strong national presence. Today, the brand operates 22 locations nationwide, according to its website.\n\nWhile that number is still impressive, Houlihan's has closed several restaurants over the past few years, significantly shrinking its footprint across multiple states.\n\nIn recent months, at least five Houlihan's locations have shut down. Despite the wave of closures, its parent company, Landry's, Inc., has not issued a public statement addressing the shutdowns; instead, operators have opted for posting paper notices on restaurant entrances.\n\nNoblesville, Indiana: Closed January 1, 2026 \n\nHershey, Pennsylvania: Closed December 31, 2025 \n\nGarland, Texas: Closed August 24, 2025 \n\nLong Island, New York: Closed January 1, 2026 \n\nUpper Arlington, Ohio: Closed January 1, 2026 \n\nHoulihan's financial challenges trace back several years. In 2019, HRI Holding Corp., the brand's then-parent company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, reporting between $50 million and $100 million in both assets and liabilities, as stated in the filing.\n\nThe company cited an expiring loan and \"unsustainably high occupancy costs\" at many locations as key contributors to its debt. The bankruptcy filing was intended to facilitate a sale, ultimately leading to an asset purchase agreement with Landry's, Inc. for $40 million in cash.\n\n21-year-old fast-food chain is closing 20 restaurants amid comeback\n\n17-year-old Mexican chain closes most restaurants after ICE raids\n\nPopular coffee chain closing its headquarters after bankruptcy\n\nAt the time, HRI operated 47 restaurants in 14 states, including 34 Houlihan's locations. However, the bankruptcy filing did not include 21 additional franchised Houlihan's restaurants.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 Golden Globes are officially upon us.\n\nOn Sunday, celebrities gathered at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles for the 83rd annual awards ceremony. The event, hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser for the second year in a row, celebrates the best in television shows and films.\n\nHollywood's biggest stars arrived at the awards show in their red-carpet best, from statement suits to daring gowns.\n\nTake a look at some of the best outfits of the night.\n\nInfiniti, who was nominated for her role in \"One Battle After Another,\" wore a structural gown custom-designed by Louis Vuitton for the Golden Globes. It featured a mermaid-style skirt in velvet, along with a strapless corset adorned with a peplum detail.\n\nThe latter was covered in mirrored pieces that sparkled as she walked across the carpet.\n\nThe \"Ballerina\" star, who was presenting at this year's event, dazzled in a glitter-covered gown. The black dress was sleeveless and daring, thanks to its scooped neckline and its thigh-high slit.\n\nShe also wore platform heels and a silver necklace.\n\nShe strutted the red carpet in an eye-catching design from Saint Laurent. The black, sequined gown featured long sleeves, a deep neckline that accentuated her diamond Tiffany & Co. necklace, and fanned, pleated pieces that cascaded above her shoulders.\n\nCyrus was nominated in the original song category this year for \"Dream As One\" from \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\n\nThe \"Die My Love\" star, who was nominated for her role in the film, wore one of the night's boldest looks: a see-through gown with strategically placed floral appliqués. It was a custom look from Givenchy.\n\nShe also carried a satin shawl with the same floral print across her shoulders, and she accessorized with a thin diamond necklace.\n\nThe musician and presenter at the 2026 Golden Globes put a glamorous twist on her signature bold style. She wore a black-and-white Saint Laurent gown that featured a feathered bodice with off-the-shoulder straps, a satin bow at her waist, and a classic white skirt.\n\nLayered diamond necklaces added some sparkle to the look.\n\nLouis Vuitton custom-designed Blunt's white gown. It featured an asymmetrical, shrug-like top with a high neckline and crystal button detailing. The top left one of her arms exposed, and the form-fitting skirt flared slightly at the bottom.\n\nBlunt, who was nominated for her performance in \"The Smashing Machine,\" paired the dress with sparkly stud earrings that coordinated with the buttons on her gown.\n\nSeyfried, who was nominated for both her performance in the film \"The Testament of Ann Lee\" and the limited series \"Long Bright River\" at the 2026 Golden Globes, looked glamorous in a strapless white dress. The custom Versace gown's opaque fabric wrapped around her body, matching the flowing scarf she draped around her arms.\n\nSeyfried also wore a sparkling diamond necklace from Tiffany & Co. and silver heels.\n\nThe Hollywood legend arrived in a solid black dress with long sleeves that mirrored the gown's plunging V-shaped neckline. Though her custom Armani Privé gown was simple, it was the perfect piece to highlight her strawberry-shaped charm necklace and matching ring.\n\nRoberts was nominated at the 2026 Golden Globes for her performance in \"After the Hunt.\"\n\nIdris — who stars in \"F1,\" which was nominated for cinematic and box office achievement — wore a slightly oversize, double-breasted jacket with large lapels custom-designed by Prada.\n\nHe paired the jacket with slim-fitting pants, a silver top, and a black bow tie. He designed his own jewelry through DIDRIS.\n\nHudson's custom Armani Privé gown shimmered as she walked the red carpet thanks to the fringed, silver fabric that covered much of the dress. Bejeweled embellishments adorned the neckline and center of the dress, coordinating with the diamond jewelry she paired with the look.\n\nHudson was nominated for her performance in \"Song Sung Blue.\"\n\nThe \"One Battle After Another\" actor, who was nominated for her performance in the film, arrived at the Golden Globes in a black, figure-hugging gown.\n\nDramatic cutouts on the bodice cut across Taylor's torso, and a ribbon of fabric flowed out from the back of the halter neckline to form a train. She completed the custom Schiaparelli look with diamond jewelry.\n\nDeutch put a modern spin on flapper flair in a black-and-white gown. The bodice of the semi-sheer, white dress plunged low on her navel, where a jewel-encrusted black stripe of fabric cut across her waist. Tassels of black fabric dripped off the beltline before the white skirt fell to the floor and formed a dramatic train.\n\nThe \"Nouvelle Vague\" star paired the ethereal look with minimalist jewelry.\n\nBell, who was nominated for her performance in \"Nobody Wants This,\" wore an asymmetrical Armani gown with a multicolored bodice and a long skirt that looked like it was made from liquid silk.\n\nLong earrings and an updo hairstyle completed the look.\n\nWilliams, who stars in the hit series \"Heated Rivalry,\" made his Golden Globes debut in an Armani set that included black trousers, a white blazer, and an unbuttoned top tucked into a satin cummerbund.\n\nHe also wore a Bulgari necklace and ring set that resembled gold serpents wrapped around him, along with Louboutin shoes. Williams was a presenter for his inaugural Globes.\n\nThe actor and Rare Beauty founder went classic Hollywood with a black Chanel gown. The strapless piece had a white, feathered neckline and a floor-length skirt.\n\nGomez, who was nominated for her performance in \"Only Murders in the Building,\" wore her hair in a wavy bob and donned deep red lipstick.\n\nConnor Storrie, who also stars in \"Heated Rivalry\" and attended to present an award, looked sharp in a black suit with satin lapels and detailing from Saint Laurent.\n\nHe wore it with a watch, a diamond brooch, sunglasses, and silver jewelry.\n\nGlen Powell's blue Brunello Cucinelli tuxedo had a retro flair thanks to its thick cummerbund, velvet fabric, and black lapels. He paired the statement suit with round sunglasses.\n\nPowell was nominated for his performance in \"Chad Powers.\"\n\nMinnie Driver's striped, strapless gown from Sabina Bilenko featured sheer, bedazzled panels to offset its black fabric, creating a glamorous look that wasn't over the top. Strips of fabric also flowed out from the sides to create a modern take on a train. A sparkly choker completed the look.\n\nDriver, who recently appeared in \"Emily in Paris,\" was in attendance to present an award at the 2026 Golden Globes.\n\nColman Domingo, who attended to present an award, wore classic black trousers, a button-up top, and a matching jacket that was embellished with sparkling crystal pieces down one side. Valentino custom-designed the look.\n\n\"The Running Man\" star complemented the perfectly tailored suit with a statement watch.\n\nElle Fanning, who was nominated for her performance in \"Sentimental Value,\" sparkled in her sleeveless Gucci gown. It was form-fitting with a V-shaped neckline and a straight skirt that reached the floor.\n\nTo complete the look, she added a thick diamond necklace that sat across her collarbone.",

    "description": "Julius Bruch spent seven years at McKinsey before founding an AI dementia startup. He shares what made the leap hard — and why consulting helped.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Julius Bruch, the 39-year-old cofounder and CEO of AI healthtech startup Isaac Health. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.\n\nI started training in general medicine and neurology, and I've always been passionate about this area, partially because my grandmother had an atypical form of dementia. I completed my Ph.D. in dementia, focusing on the molecular aspects and drug discovery.\n\nComing out of the research world, I went into McKinsey because I was interested in how the healthcare system works more broadly and how the different parts fit together. During my seven-and-a-half years at McKinsey, I worked with payers, health systems, and state governments on value-based care, chronic condition management, and digital health.\n\nI left in 2021 because I wanted to move on and put things into practice. I felt like I had seen and learned it, and it became a decision between becoming a career consultant or seeing myself as someone who wanted to build something innovative.\n\nConsulting was a fantastic training opportunity. I learned a lot about how the healthcare system works, how different parts work together, and how to structure a problem. I would say it was the best possible preparation for being a founder that you can think of.\n\nThe relationships I built — both inside the firm and with clients — have been a key success driver for the business. It means you know who to reach out to, people at payers you can problem-solve with, and some initial contact points for fundraising. The alumni network is strong.\n\nYou also train your analytical thinking and problem-solving approach. Starting a company feels like a consulting engagement — you're interviewing a lot of people, trying to solve a problem, and building a solution. Eventually, it outgrows that, but the thinking that there's always a way to solve something comes from that analytical training.\n\nThe main thing to unlearn from consulting was the pursuit of perfection. A startup needs to be able to move fast with scrappy pragmatism. The other thing I had to unlearn was always giving in to clients. As a startup founder, you learn quickly where boundaries need to be set.\n\nInitially, it felt a bit like: What am I doing? Am I just playing around?\n\nStarting a business was a bit of a dream, but not something I was going to do at any cost.\n\nI definitely lost some sweat over making the decision. I told myself I would give it three months. After those three months, there was enough traction to make it work and continue moving forward.\n\nStartup life is a lot less structured, and you have to be comfortable with that.\n\nEvery major milestone feels like a massive reward because you're fighting for it. It's not like things just run smoothly and that's it. Every client you get, every revenue milestone, and any external recognition is hard-fought for.\n\nIn August, our startup raised $10.5 million in Series A funding, bringing the company's total funding to $16.3 million. It feels great for a day — you realize that more investment also means higher expectations and that the goal posts have moved.\n\nEvery startup faces challenges, like scaling. We have a service component, so there are always people involved as we grow, and that comes with difficulties. You have to hire, find the right talent, and keep changing the processes, because the way things work for a team of four people doesn't work for a team of 60 or 70.\n\nJumping into a startup also means being open to flexibility. You have to be able to wear multiple hats and jump in where needed.\n\nMany people come in quite timidly. They want to work within their scope and be trained on the job. But you really have to create everything from scratch, like workflows. It requires a lot of creativity and problem-solving. Sometimes, I could have acted faster on certain things or signals.\n\nGo with the science and find a cofounder who is deeply rooted in the subject matter. I see a lot of startups that are a little bit obvious or built on very standard, replaceable models without a major moat. It's important to make sure you are cutting-edge.\n\nDo you have a story to share about becoming an AI startup founder? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "description": "Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, a commander of a drone team, told Business Insider what it was like flying in the heavy fog that Russia used to its advantage.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, an ISR drone team leader in Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces. He deployed in 2025 near Pokrovsk, a key city that Russia said it captured in early December.\n\nBusiness Insider has verified his role in the Ukrainian armed forces. The article has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore the full-scale war, I was a software engineer, working for companies in San Francisco, New Zealand, and Germany.\n\nToday, I lead a team of five to six Ukrainian drone operators. Our task is to use high-flying drones to provide reconnaissance data to our troops and commanders.\n\nWith our intelligence, artillery such as HIMARS and drone strike teams can target Russian equipment and soldiers, often before they can even reach the front lines.\n\nWe were redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in August because the fighting there had become so intense. Because drone operators are priority targets in the war, we would spend our dayslong rotations in houses and underground bunkers outside the city.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the weather was sunny and ideal for flying.\n\nBut the end of October was a disaster for us. Ukraine turns foggy in the autumn, with thick and low clouds that can stack from 100 meters to 300 meters above the ground.\n\nThese are so thick that no infrared camera or thermal camera can see through them, and caused many days to be completely no-go for flying for our types of drones.\n\nAt the time, the Russians took advantage of the clouds, using them to cover their advance on foot and in vehicles. Given the weather, the number of personnel they sacrificed to take the city, and our limited resources, there was eventually no viable way for us to defend Pokrovsk forever.\n\nUkraine is dependent on drone warfare. It has carried us through the terrible and scary times of these Russian assaults, and it has changed the face of war. For the entire summer of 2025, for example, I saw a tank only twice on the battlefield.\n\nDrones are cheap and effective, and if we had an infinite number of drones, we would have been working 24/7 to fight the Russians in Pokrovsk.\n\nBut we don't have infinite drones, so in the meantime, we need other strike tools and resources, such as more artillery fire and troops. War is complex, and drones cannot be its only solution.\n\nIn normal conditions, we fly our drones four times a day, with each flight lasting about three to four hours and sometimes into the night. It's tiring, but worth it, because you can make an enormous difference for Ukrainian defenders. We can spot where Russian forces are moving, denying them the element of surprise, and scout for assets such as air defenses and artillery for commanders to strike.\n\nRecon drone operators like us rely heavily on visual navigation. We study Pokrovsk so closely that, even when our drone is being spoofed, we can determine our flying location simply by the shape of the terrain or landmarks.\n\nWhen the foggy season comes, we try to make the most of any good visibility. Sometimes, you can get lucky and perform five flights in a five-day rotation.\n\nHowever, there were days when we found ourselves sitting in a house, just waiting for the weather to clear.\n\nYou can try to fly under the clouds, but going low means our bulky drones are more easily spotted and destroyed. Since we have limited tools, we try to preserve them and not use them recklessly.\n\nStill, on days with strong winds, there's a chance that the clouds may break slightly and give you glimpses of the battlefield. Sometimes, when visibility is bad but not impossible to work with, we must risk flying in such weather, especially if our troops are defending against a major assault.\n\nIn late summer, the situation in Pokrovsk was becoming increasingly problematic, both on the ground and in the sky. Back in the day, we would help long-range artillery focus on the Russian rear.\n\nI began to notice that Russia's tactics were making an impact around September.\n\nAcross the warzone, their strategy is to find our limit and overwhelm it with the smallest number of soldiers needed to seize our positions.\n\nIt is simple mathematics. Initially, they would send around 10 soldiers. If that wasn't enough, they would send 20. Then they would try 30.\n\nDay by day, they increase the number of troops and equipment. Their goal is to create a situation where we don't have enough drones to counter the amount of attacking infantry.\n\nTo eliminate an assault of 50 guys, all spread out, we'd need at least 150 drones and artillery, which is difficult for us to organize with our limited resources.\n\nWhen we were working in Pokrovsk, there were already areas of the city where the Russians had advanced, so the fighting area was porous and undefined.\n\nIf we had more troops, we could have held out for much longer and performed more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIf we had more recon drones, our team could have flown over Pokrovsk nonstop, working despite the clouds.\n\nWith more first-person-view strike drones, our pilots could continue to find and attack the Russians closer to the ground.\n\nBut we don't have enough. So, we need other strike tools besides FPV drones, even though they account for about 80% of our kills on Russians.\n\nIronically, some of these tools have disappeared because warfare has changed so much. Mortars might have helped, but we mostly stopped using them — the battlefield is now so transparent that it is a suicide mission to ride around close to the front line in your pickup truck with a mortar.\n\nWhat we definitely need is artillery ammunition. Last year, some HIMARS units I worked with were rationed to four strikes a week.\n\nOther artillery units were limited to just three artillery shells a day. We would find them a target, and they would say: \"We don't have any more for today. Sorry, guys.\"\n\nThe weather in this season means it is still what drone pilots call our \"low season.\" At the same time, the terrain is now not too muddy, so it is the perfect time for Russians to attack.\n\nThis month, I am redeploying to Dnipro. The fight continues.",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nRestoration efforts at the Church of Saint Philibert in France led to the discovery of a forgotten staircase and a 400-year-old burial vault.\n\nThe archaeological finds didn’t stop there, with experts locating sarcophagi from the sixth century.\n\nThe current 12th century church was built over an array of older churches and buildings.\n\nAn excursion down a forgotten staircase in a 12th century French church resulted not only in a lost burial vault, but in a trip back in time to the sixth century.\n\nThe discovery was part of a restoration project at the Church of Saint Philibert in Dijon, France, which was necessary because of an ill-advised decision made in the 1970s. The installation of a heated concrete slab trapped the salt-filled ground under it—the 800-year-old church was used for salt storage in the 18th and 19th centuries—and when heated, the salt caused cracking and damage to the stone church’s foundation.\n\nAs crews came to investigate and dig into the foundation of the church, they dug into the foundation in a variety of locations, and the restoration quickly morphed into a full archaeological search, which resulted in the discovery of a vault hidden in the church’s transept that held the coffins of children and adults, according to a translated statement from the French National Institute for Preventative Archaeological Research (Inrap). The burials featured basic shroud wrappings, with a few ancient coins and rosaries alongside the remains.\n\nThe archaeological team—led by Clarisse Couderc and Carole Fossurier—also discovered slab tombs from the 11th through 13th centuries, and even six sarcophagi from the Late Antiquity and Merovingian periods.\n\nWhile the current Church of Saint Philibert was founded in the second half of the 12th century—additions since have included a porch, bell tower, spire, and side chapel—the archaeological team located additional evidence of an earlier church on the site, which had actually first been discovered during 1923 excavations. Deeper still, they found remnants of walls from the Early Middle Ages, which had been built using herringbone masonry techniques that the team believes dates it to the 10th century.\n\nThe sarcophagi were even older, though, and one of the six coffins featuring a sculpted lid. The Inrap experts believe the finding of burials from so many eras shows that the church was an important funerary center during the switch from the Roman era to the Early Middle Ages (the sarcophagi were likely inside another ancient building when first buried).\n\nWho knows what else remains to be discovered?\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Border Czar Tom Homan quickly grew impatient with Kristen Welker questioning him about reports that he allegedly accepted a $50,000 payoff from undercover FBI agents.\n\nIn a tense exchange on Meet the Press, Welker — who devoted most of her questioning to Wednesday’s fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis — took the opportunity to press the border czar about a topic on which he’s subjected himself to very little scrutiny in confrontational interviews.\n\n“As you know, in an undercover operation in 2024, the FBI recorded you accepting a bag, which was determined to contain $50,000 from agents posing as business executives who said you indicated you could help win government contracts in the second Trump administration,” Welker said. “I want to stress there was an investigation. It was closed, last year. The Justice Department said it found, ‘No credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.’ I do want to give you an opportunity to respond, though, Mr. Homan. Where is that $50,000? Did you keep it or did you return it?”\n\n“I didn’t take $50,000 from anybody,” Homan said — flatly denying that he accepted the cash. “And that’s a question for the FBI. I’m not going to give this story any more air. Bottom line, I did nothing illegal. I did nothing. And the FBI and DOJ reviewed this. No credible evidence I did anything, because I didn’t do anything illegal.”\n\nWelker pressed the border czar.\n\n“But was there $50,000 in the bag and did you return it?” Welker\n\nHoman bristled at the follow-up.\n\n“Kristen, I’m not giving the story any more air,” Homan replied. “This is an attack on my integrity and my professionalism. I’m not addressing it. That’s a question with the FBI.\n\nWelker noted reports that there are FBI tapes of the alleged payoff.\n\n“Can you address, given that it’s been recorded, did you keep the money?” Welker asked. “Did you return the money?”\n\n“I did not keep any,” Homan responded. “Fifty-thousand dollars is ridiculous. And it irritates me, this story keeps going on, and on, and on, even though I’ve been found with nothing inappropriate. So I will not answer any more of these questions!”\n\n“But did you return the money?” Welker asked.\n\n“I didn’t have any money to return,” Homan said. “I didn’t take the $50,000, bottom line.”\n\nWelker then pressed Homan on the issue of the reported tapes.\n\n“You’re saying you did nothing unlawful. Would you be comfortable with the FBI releasing the recordings?”\n\n“That’s a decision for the FBI,” Homan replied.\n\n“It might be a decision for the FBI, but would you be comfortable if they release those recordings?” Welker asked.\n\n“I get it,” Homan said. “I’m not getting ahead of the FBI in this investigation.”\n\n“But can you just say, on a personal level, would you be comfortable releasing the recordings?” Welker asked.\n\n“I am not going to get ahead of the FBI,” Homan said. “That’s their decision.”\n\nThe post ‘I Will Not Answer Any More of These Questions!’ Tom Homan Bristles at Kristen Welker Confronting Him About Alleged $50K Payoff first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "There was no shortage of high-fashion looks at the 2026 Golden Globes, but some stars, such as Jennifer Lopez, missed the mark with their outfits.",
    "fullText": "Any true Golden Globes fan will tell you that the fashion is half the fun of the night.\n\nIt's always exciting to see what outfits A-list stars arrive in, and the 2026 Golden Globes, held at the Beverly Hilton on Sunday, were no exception.\n\nHowever, as is usually the case, some celebrities didn't wear their best red-carpet looks. Take a look at some of the outfits that missed the mark at this year's Golden Globes.\n\nO'Leary, who starred in the nominated film \"Marty Supreme,\" walked the Golden Globes red carpet in a burgundy suit that was sharp in color and style. Still, his accessories distracted from the look.\n\nHe wore a diamond necklace with a ruby charm, a matching pin on his lapel, and two statement watches: a Cartier Asymétrique and a Chronomètre à Résonance from F.P. Journe. He could've gone without one of the timepieces.\n\nThe star of \"Hunting Wives\" and \"The Beast in Me\" wore a strapless, shapeless design by Danielle Frankel.\n\nThe top half of the white dress might have worked if it had flowed into a straight skirt. Instead, it featured a wide hem with a satin panel that looked out of place.\n\nThe \"Zootopia\" voice actor walked the red carpet in a gray Armani gown adorned with pearls. It was also semi-sheer with long sleeves and a floor-length skirt.\n\nThe dress was unfortunately overwhelming on the petite star. It also might have looked more glamorous if it were opaque instead of transparent.\n\nPerfetti, known for his work on \"Abbott Elementary,\" hit the red carpet in a blue suit crafted from satin by Christian Cowan.\n\nHis jacket was especially noteworthy, as it featured no buttons and was held together by a silver rose, but that detail made for a confusing illusion. Without buttons, the top half of his outfit looked incomplete.\n\nMeester, who guest-starred in the Golden Globe-nominated series \"Nobody Wants This,\" arrived at the awards show in a strapless Miu Miu gown. Yellow, silky fabric lined the neckline, while the rest of the form-fitting dress was pink and adorned with three-dimensional embellishments that shimmered as she walked the red carpet. Kendra Scott jewelry completed the ensemble.\n\nMost of the dress was beautiful, but the pop of yellow distracted from the detailed beading that made the gown feel special. If the neckline had been made of the same fabric as the rest of the gown, Meester would have been one of the best-dressed stars of the night.\n\nOrtega arrived in an all-black look designed by Dilara Findikoglu, which felt like a fun nod to her Golden Globe-nominated performance in \"Wednesday.\"\n\nThe embellished top featured a high neckline, tassels of fabric that cascaded down her arms, and daring cutouts on the sides that flowed into a backless silhouette. The low-waisted skirt had a subtle train, and Ortega paired the look with Simone Jewels and Christian Louboutin boots.\n\nThe dress had pretty elements, but it had too much going on. If it had the cutouts without so much texture, the daring silhouette could have spoken for itself.\n\nGoggins' black jacket and pants could have been the trappings of a simple suit, but instead, he paired them with a sparkly gold blouse and a Western-style black tie.\n\nThe Saint Laurent look was funky, but the shirt almost looked costume-like because of how sparkly it was. Goggins, who was nominated for best supporting actor for \"The White Lotus\" at the 2026 Golden Globes, could have swapped the shirt for something more neutral with gold detailing so it felt less over the top.\n\nPoehler, who won the best podcast award for \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler,\" chose a jumpsuit for the Golden Globes. The top was white and had short sleeves, while the pants were black and flared. Jewelry custom-designed by Pandora, along with a red clutch, completed her look.\n\nAlthough the outfit stood out in a sea of gowns, it could have benefited from some tweaks. It may have worked better if it had been fitted at the waist or if it had more drama, which would have made it feel more formal for the event.\n\nThe star of \"The Naked Gun,\" who presented at the 2026 Golden Globes, wore all-white to the event, pairing a billowing, long-sleeved blouse that had flared cuffs with a column skirt. She showed off her diamond necklaces and sparkly hoop earrings with a sophisticated updo.\n\nThe top of Anderson's outfit looked a bit too casual for the awards ceremony. A more formal top could have made the outfit stand out more.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he's \"inclined\" to keep ExxonMobil out of Venezuela.\n\nIn a Sunday press gaggle on Air Force One, a reporter asked Trump which oil companies have made commitments to investments in Venezuela, and if Exxon has done so.\n\n\"I'd probably be inclined to keep Exxon out. I didn't like their response. They're playing too cute,\" Trump said to the reporter.\n\nHe said that he did not like Exxon's response to his $100 billion plan to invest in the Venezuelan oil industry. On Friday, Exxon's CEO, Darren Woods, told the president that he does not think Venezuela is currently ripe for investment.\n\n\"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela — today, it's uninvestable,\" Woods said in the meeting with Trump and oil executives at the White House.\n\nHe said that Exxon, which is based in Texas, has a long history in Venezuela, having operated in the country twice. He said the company has had its assets in Venezuela seized on both those occasions.\n\nWoods said that significant changes need to happen in the country to consider reentering, but he was confident the Trump administration could work with the Venezuelan government to implement those changes.\n\nHowever, other oil executives were more optimistic. Chevron's vice chairman, Mark Nelson, told Trump that the company plans to increase its current production with oil partners in Venezuela by 100% \"effective immediately.\"\n\nTrump's comments about Exxon come more than a week after US military forces launched a strike in Venezuela and captured the Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Maduro is being tried by a New York court for drug trafficking and weapons charges.\n\nExxon's stock price has remained largely flat after the bell on Friday. It's up more than 16% in the past year.",

    "fullText": "Helen Mirren, 80, isn't buying into the fantasy of eternal youth.\n\nIn an interview with Elle published on Sunday, Mirren spoke about the tech industry's obsession with living forever and why trying to hack aging misses the point.\n\n\"To me, the word longevity is being active, proactive, and productive over a long period of one's life,\" Mirren told Elle. \"Living has to do with enjoying the physical elements of life; the beauty of nature; the excitement of professional success, if you're lucky enough to have it; and family and kids.\"\n\nTo her, longevity means \"contributing in as many diverse ways as possible, for as long as possible,\" she said.\n\nAt the end of the day, trying to beat aging becomes a distraction from living fully. Accepting life's limits, Mirren said, is simply part of growing up.\n\n\"Life is finite. There is no fighting that — as much as people like to put themselves into ice, hoping that they might wake up in 50 years. It's a dream and a fantasy. It's very strange to me. I don't call it growing old. I call it growing up. You constantly grow up through life. But the tech bros who cannot face the idea that they will get old and die just can't deal with it. I think it's so funny. They just haven't grown up yet,\" she said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Mirren has spoken about her views on aging. In October, she told Allure that she loves \"everything\" about growing older.\n\n\"Fuck it, I'm alive and I'm working and I can drink a glass of wine and I can wear makeup and I can listen to music and I can watch a beautiful sunset and I can go to the theater and I can watch a movie and I can binge Netflix and I can live life. It's a beautiful thing,\" she said.\n\nTo stay healthy, Mirren has long championed a 12-minute military workout developed in the 1950s by the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nShe's also said that it's never too late to start moving, particularly for people in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be joining a gym. It can be small changes like taking a short walk or practicing yoga, which I still enjoy,\" Mirren said.",

    "fullText": "A Google AI product manager's career advice is unexpectedly crustacean.\n\nMarily Nika, who has worked in AI product roles for over a decade, said in an episode of \"The Growth Podcast\" by Aakash Gupta published Sunday that aspiring product managers should \"be like crabs.\"\n\n\"That means that you need to move adjacent to what you've been doing,\" Nika said, adding that one's past experience is a competitive advantage.\n\nNika shared the example of a student in her AI product management boot camp who worked in the hearing aid industry and felt stuck and closed off from the tech industry. The student believed he was in a \"completely different domain\" and didn't see a clear path into product management, she said.\n\nNika encouraged him to look more closely at how his experience could translate. When they checked Apple's careers site, they found an opening for a product manager working on AirPods — a role where expertise in hearing could be relevant.\n\n\"We need to be open-minded. We really need to bring in the previous experience we have because that's gonna set us apart,\" Nika said.\n\nNika also provided another example involving a sports journalist who sought to transition into an AI product manager role in sports. Rather than being afraid of lacking a traditional product résumé, Nika advised him to lean into his domain expertise. Product skills can be learned, but a deep understanding of users and industries is harder to replace, she said.\n\nNika said becoming \"AI literate\" is now essential for product managers.\n\n\"Understand the unique intricacies that AI brings, understand how dependent we are on data,\" she said, describing how AI has become an expectation for the role.\n\nAspiring product managers should also understand \"what goes behind coding,\" like knowing what APIs are and how products are shipped.\n\nOther tech leaders and workers echo the same message.\n\nA vice president of product and growth for AI products at Dropbox told Business Insider last year that product managers should familiarize themselves with new AI tools, including vibe coding tools that enable non-coders to quickly prototype ideas.\n\nInstead of spending time writing documents, product managers can use AI tools to build lightweight prototypes to test ideas early, he said. This can help \"accelerate how they think about developing their taste, developing their craft, and understanding what makes sense in physical products,\" he added.\n\nA senior product manager at Microsoft told Business Insider in December that product managers will increasingly be expected to use AI to work faster. He said AI tools helped him draft work documents, summarize information, and generate suggestions for approaching product management problems.",

    "description": "Ukraine said the \"Geran-5\" bears similarities to Iran's Karrar attack drone, and uses a more powerful engine than Russia's current turbojet Shaheds.",
    "fullText": "Russia has attacked Ukraine with a new type of long-range drone that uses a powerful jet engine to fly 600 miles with a 200-pound explosive warhead, Kyiv's military intelligence agency said.\n\nThe Ukrainian intelligence directorate, or GUR, released a statement on Sunday providing new details about what it dubbed the \"Geran-5.\"\n\nGUR said the drone was used during an attack in early 2026.\n\n\"Unlike previous modifications of the 'Geran' line, the device is made according to a normal aerodynamic scheme,\" GUR said, adding that the Geran-5 bears a strong resemblance to Iran's Karrar attack drone.\n\nPublished images showed wreckage of the apparent device on snow-laden ground, which included long fixed wings attached to a slender chassis. Business Insider could not independently verify the location and date of the images.\n\nThe Geran-5 is roughly 20 feet long, with a wingspan of about 18 feet, GUR added.\n\n\"The warhead weighs about 90 kg, and the declared range is about 1,000 km,\" the intelligence agency said.\n\nRussia's Geran drone family is most often associated with the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munition. The Geran-1, Geran-2, and Geran-3 are inexpensive, mass-manufactured drones modeled after the Shahed but tweaked for production inside Russia.\n\nWhile the new drone's design differs significantly from that of the typical Shahed, GUR said it was being classified as a type of Geran because it shares many key components with Russian Shahed-like drones.\n\nThese include a jet engine made by Telefly, a Chinese company, and a microcomputer that GUR said is modeled after Raspberry Pi, a UK-designed low-cost computer that fits on a small board.\n\nThe Geran-3, a newer drone resembling Iran's Shahed-238, was earlier reported by Ukraine to use a Telefly JT80 turbojet engine that allows the device to fly at speeds of up to 230 miles per hour.\n\nGUR said the Telefly engine on the Geran-5 generates even more thrust, but did not give specifics about the drone's speed.\n\nUkrainian authorities have said that they've found Raspberry Pi 4 computers on Russia's more commonly used Geran-2s. These drones, modeled after the Shahed-136, are Russia's main tool in the hundreds-strong waves bombarding Ukraine and require computers for functions such as transmitting navigation data to operators.\n\nTelefly did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider. The Raspberry Pi Foundation did not respond to a similar request sent outside regular business hours.\n\nGUR said that the Geran-5 also uses 3G and 4G modems, as well as a 12-channel Comet, otherwise known as Kometa, satellite navigation system. The Kometa is typically known to use multiple antennas, which makes it more resistant to jamming.\n\n\"As with previous 'geraniums,' this UAV is difficult to consider as a Russian Federation development,\" GUR said.\n\nNotably, the intelligence agency said it had information that Russia is looking to launch the Geran-5 from another aircraft, such as the Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet.\n\nUsing the drone in this way would likely greatly increase its operational range, since the Su-25 can fly out a distance before launching the Geran-5. Russia has typically been launching its older Gerans from ground-based ramps in Western Russia, annexed Crimea, and occupied Ukraine.\n\n\"Separately, the possibility of equipping the aircraft with R-73 air-to-air missiles to counter Ukrainian aviation is being considered,\" GUR said.\n\nThe R-73 is a Soviet-era heat-seeking missile, also known as the AA-11 Archer by NATO, designed to be fired from fighter jets to attack other aircraft.\n\nUkraine has previously said that it found Russia had mounted some of its Geran-2s with the R-60, an older air-to-air missile, to target aircraft such as helicopters trying to hunt down drones.",

    "description": "Major gauges made slight losses as Wall Street prepares for a week of major releases against a backdrop of global volatility.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures dropped Sunday night as Wall Street reacted to the Trump administration opening a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) and futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) fell 0.5%. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) slumped 0.8%.\n\nInvestors were rattled late Sunday evening after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell released a statement revealing that the Department of Justice had subpoenaed the US central bank.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic video address, Powell stated \"the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June.\"\n\nPowell claimed that the move was a direct attack for the setting of interest rates that \"serve the public\" rather than \"following the preferences of the President.\"\n\nThe tumultuous start follows a strong finish to last week, when stocks climbed to fresh record highs. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow (^DJI) closed Friday at new peaks, extending a rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 1% for the week. The Dow and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) posted even stronger gains, rising 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nThe significant escalation in Trump’s feud with the Fed chair comes as markets are bracing for the latest consumer inflation report, due Tuesday. The release comes on the heels of Friday’s December jobs report, which showed continued cooling in the labor market without signaling a sharp economic slowdown.\n\nTaken together, the data has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will remain on hold for now, with CME FedWatch offering a 95% probability of rates staying the same.\n\nBeyond the economic calendar, geopolitical developments remain a wildcard. President Trump is reportedly weighing potential action involving Iran, while also escalating pressure on Cuba over Venezuelan oil shipments. Late last week, Trump also renewed controversial comments about Greenland, saying the US could pursue control of the Danish territory “whether they like it or not.”\n\nInvestors are now turning their attention to the first major catalysts of 2026: earnings season and key inflation data. Several of Wall Street’s biggest banks are set to report in the coming days, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nVISHNU VARATHAN, HEAD OF ⁠MACRO RESEARCH, ASIA EX-JAPAN, ‌MIZUHO, SINGAPORE\n\n\"The Fed independence question is now well and alive and maybe subject to re-evaluation every few meetings.\n\n\"I think ‍I'm still not sure how sustained and adversarial the attack on the Fed might be. There could be a scenario where Trump could still appoint someone with ​some credibility and allow this person to run the show - so ‌that's probably why markets aren't panicking as yet.\"\n\nANDREW LILLEY, CHIEF RATES STRATEGIST AT BARRENJOEY, SYDNEY\n\n\"Trump is pulling at the loose threads of central bank independence. I don't even believe that he expects that Chair Powell will be charged... The only reason that he's taking these steps is that ⁠he knows that he's not going to ​take control of the Fed, so he ​wants to exert as much undue pressure as he can.\n\n\"It is not good. Don't get me wrong, but I think ‍it will amount to ⁠nothing. Investors won't be happy about it, but it shows actually Trump has no other levers to pull. The cash rate ⁠will stay what the majority of the FOMC wants them to be.\"",

    "title": "You've Been Warned: Consumer Reports Says These 10 Electric Vehicles Are The Least Reliable",
    "description": "Consumer Reports ranks the least-reliable electric vehicles from 2024 and 2025, with models ranging from sedans to trucks and SUVs.",
    "fullText": "Before purchasing your next electric vehicle (EV), do your research. Not performing due diligence is one of the common mistakes people make when looking for a used car. And never make your choice based on popularity. Some of the most popular cars, trucks, and SUVs are highly unreliable. Fortunately, Consumer Reports (CR) has done much of the research for you. If you want to avoid being stuck with a lemon, take note of CR's findings.\n\nYou have to approach the process with an open mind. If you have a preconceived idea about a vehicle, it will cloud your judgment. For example, you may think well of a car simply because of its brand. However, you may be surprised to learn that the car's marquee brand has been producing substandard vehicles and a long list of unhappy customers.\n\nThe vehicles below are listed according to their overall CR reliability score, where the lowest is 1, and the highest is 100. The list begins with the lowest-scoring automobile and progresses to the one with that scores highest. But you should remember that the scores are relative. Even the highest-ranking vehicle on this list has still been determined by CR to be one of the least reliable EVs on the market.\n\nConsumer Reports had several nice things to say about the 2024 Kia EV9, not surprising since the brand has produced dependable cars for budget-minded people for years. There's plenty of room with its three rows of seats, it's fast for an SUV that size, and its design makes viewing the passing landscape easy. But the magazine slapped it with a reliability score of only 5 out of 100. The two factors for such a poor showing were the powertrain and the EV battery, both of which received a grade of 1 out of 5.\n\nThe EV9 was subject to six recalls, all occurring in 2024. The first, in April, involved the electrical system. Dealers were told to replace the gear drive unit. The unit's differential gear bolts were loose, creating the possibility of the differential locking or the vehicle losing drive power. Later that spring, the front passenger seatbelt assembly needed replacing due to a faulty retractor. In June, dealers began replacing headliners that were missing the protection they required to help occupants survive a rollover accident.\n\nThen the software for the parking assist feature was buggy, miscalculating the distances that determine safe parking. In the autumn, the vehicle had another software issue. The display panel would no longer show important driver information, such as the speed the vehicle was traveling. Kia then ended the year with another seatbelt recall. This time, it was to correct the belts for second and third-row passengers. Important mounting bolts were missing.\n\nGenesis has received praise in the past for its vehicles that have challenged traditional pricey car makers like Mercedes and BMW, but the automaker has been humbled by forgettable products like the 2024 GV60. This electric SUV is so bad, it finished at the bottom of Consumer Report's ranking of 2024 SUVs. The magazine could only give the vehicle a 1 for the reliability of its powertrain. Its EV battery received the same humiliating score.\n\nThe GV60 has five recalls, three of which focus on the electrical system. Twice in 2024, the risk of a crash was deemed possible because of a sudden loss of power. There's an integrated charging control unit responsible for keeping the battery charged. It was possible for this unit to become damaged and stop feeding the battery. The result was a vehicle without power, which posed a danger to vehicles traveling behind it.\n\nThe other electrical problem was a bug in the software operating the driver's instrument panel display. The failure kept drivers from knowing how fast they were traveling. It also prevented them from benefiting from modern collision warnings. Similarly, there was a recall for a backup camera that failed to display. Software problems caused the camera to shut down when the driver put the SUV in reverse. The latest recall dealt with build quality. Windshield molding tended to become detached, presenting an accident risk to other drivers.\n\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV makes a fine first impression, but can't live up to expectations. Consumer Reports liked the smooth power delivery. However, the powertrain's reliability was suspect. CR slapped it with a 1 out of 5 reliability score. That's the same grade its EV battery and in-car electronics received. Overall, the car's reliability score was 9 out of a possible 100.\n\nInside EVs also found the software supporting the vehicle's MyChevrolet app to be unreliable. The same journalist also reported a rattling headliner and a moonroof that refused to close consistently. Among the staff at Edmunds, one person found the regenerative braking system caused the SUV to decelerate as if preventing a forward collision when no danger was present. For another staffer, the automatic reverse braking system stopped the vehicle three times when the staffer was trying to back out of an unobstructed driveway.\n\n​The Blazer EV has undergone four recalls. The first involved replacing door strikers and bolts to keep doors from opening on their own while the car was in motion. The second replaced the rear drive unit. Poorly insulated wires made it possible for the SUV to suddenly lose power. The third recall was for a defective control arm that could break, leaving the driver helpless to control the vehicle. And the fourth was for a parking brake that could come on while the car was being driven and go off while the car was parked, allowing the SUV to roll away.\n\nConsumer Reports liked several aspects of the 2025 Lucid Air. Reviewers noted how well the sedan, which is large enough to seat three passengers in the back seat, can still accelerate and maneuver with ease. These are two of the vehicle's features that owners also cite. The Lucid Air's driving experience received a 93 out of 100. The sedan's comfort scored even higher with a 96.Despite its size, the car also has an impressive estimated driving range of 377 miles. All the accolades, however, weren't enough to keep CR from giving the Lucid Air a 13 out of 100 on the reliability scale.\n\nThere are three recalls from 2024 and 2025. They include two that could contribute to accidents by shutting off energy to the powertrain. The first required the replacement of the rear wiring harness, which was placing too much strain on the electrical cables. There was the likelihood of cutting the power to the rear drive unit and rendering the vehicle powerless. The second potential power loss involved loose rear bolts that were supposed to keep the half-shaft engaged with the drive unit. The remaining recall mandated a software update. A glitch was causing the rearview camera to either not display an image at all or to show one that was inaccurate. Owners were notified that Lucid may have violated federal law by not notifying the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration of the problem within five days of learning about it, the administration said.\n\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Blazer EV showed marked improvement over its 2024 predecessor. The 2024 version could only manage a 9 out of 100 overall reliability score, while Consumer Reports scored the 2025 SUV at a 22.​ A rear brake issue spurred a recall. Without repair, the vehicle could disengage its brake, rolling a parked vehicle into disaster. The brake also had the tendency to engage at the wrong time, when the owner is driving. The cause was a harness that was subject to damage or corrosion.\n\nDealers were told to at least replace the harness. If necessary, they might find an alternate route for the harness and apply anti-abrasive tape. An owner complained to About Automobiles about experiencing the sudden application of the automatic braking. The same owner also said that his Blazer EV was letting in rain that caused the display panel to lose its image.\n\nBesides the recall regarding the brakes, the Blazer EV also had a recall for its door strikers and their bolts. The metal wasn't properly heat treated, damaging the metal and shortening its life expectancy. All four sets needed replacing to keep doors from opening on their own while the car was in motion. In addition to the recalls, there have been numerous technical service bulletins issued to dealers to help them understand how to address various repairs. There have been two for the automatic emergency braking system and 80 for the electrical system.\n\nSimilar to other electric vehicles, the weaknesses of the 2024 Cadillac Lyriq lie in its powertrain, the EV battery, and the in-car electronics. Consumer Reports saw fit to award the Lyriq only a 1 out of 5 for each. The vehicle also received a 1 for noises and leaks, and EV charging. The car's composite reliability score was 27 out of 100.\n\nThe 2024 Lyriq has seen five recalls from 2023 to 2025. Two recalls involved the electrical system. Dealers had to replace the rear drive units that had insufficiently insulated wires. A shortage would cause the vehicle to lose power. This is the same problem that affected the Chevrolet Blazer EV, and for good reason. The Lyriq is built on Chevrolet's electric vehicle platform using the legacy automaker's key electronic components. Another electrical system recall addressed buggy software that could cause the driver's display screen to go blank, leaving the driver without rearview cameras, warnings, or even a speedometer.\n\nThe recall for the suspension was due to loose bolts that could lead to damaging coolant lines for the EV battery or high voltage cables. The end result could be a complete shutdown. Software problems that prevented the car from braking properly triggered another recall, while a badly welded bracket that made it difficult for a seat belt to perform properly was the cause of yet another recall. Additionally, owners report problems charging both at home and on the road.\n\nConsumer Reports applauded Rivian for improving the R1S. giving the 2025 model a better riding experience and reequipping the cabin to eliminate more noise. That helps explain why the R1S is such a customer favorite while also being one of the least reliable vehicles. But even that praise came with caveats. One CR tester still didn't find the vehicle comfortable to drive, in part due to super-sensitive steering. CR also noted that the R1S was especially challenging to control at low speeds because of its intrusive regenerative braking system. Despite receiving praise for its other aspects, such as its superior acceleration and energy efficiency, the R1S could only manage a 28 in overall reliability.\n\nCR's two particular areas of concern were the climate system and the vehicle's hardware. CR gave both a score of 1 out of 5. Body hardware includes such things as windows, doors, and seat belts, which were recalled in mid-2025. They weren't properly anchored, which made it difficult for the belt to hold a passenger securely. The seat belt issue was just 1 of 7 recalls for the R1S. Two of the recalls involved the electrical system. The high voltage distribution box was not grounded correctly, leading to a possible loss of drive power. On another occasion, a software malfunction left the vehicle operating without all its exterior lighting. Exterior lighting was the subject of two other recalls. Once the headlights failed to operate properly, and on another occasion, the turn signals didn't work.\n\nThe 2025 Cadillac Lyriq is a study in contrasts. Respondents of Consumer Report's Customer Satisfaction Survey were thrilled with the driving experience and comfort of the vehicle. In both categories, they awarded it a rare perfect score of 100 out of 100. But when asked if they would purchase the vehicle again, only 58% said they would. And only 46% considered it a good value. The Lyriq's overall reliability score was 30.\n\nThe SUV has three recalls on record for the electrical system, suspension, and head restraints. The bolts holding the battery in place weren't tight enough, creating the possibility of a fire should the vehicle be in an accident that compromised the battery. The suspension issue was loose bolts on front stabilizer bar brackets. There was fear that the battery's coolant lines or the Lyriq's high voltage cables could be cut by an unmoored stabilizer bar or its bracket. The other recall dealt with a mistake in the owner's manual that would lead to people adjusting their head restraints in a way that wouldn't give them the proper protection.\n\nDespite the car receiving thumbs up for its beauty, its build quality seems to be questionable. One owner complained to Edmunds that after only a week, several problems surfaced. The wireless phone charging option failed, so he plugged in the phone only for the driver's display panel to go black. Without a functional display, the vehicle had to remain parked until the system came back online the next day.\n\nThe Acura MDX managed a 35 on Consumer Report's reliability scale. Reviewers dinged it most for its spotty brakes and its poor build quality, which resulted in various leaks and noises. ​There are two recalls for the vehicle, both issued in 2025, and both problems were serious enough to be the potential cause of accidents. At the beginning of the year, dealers were busy reprogramming software that controlled the fuel injection electronic control unit. The software glitch was causing engines to stall or for the vehicle to lose power. The problem was thought to affect over 294,000 vehicles.\n\nThe other recall came in June when Acura told dealers to replace the brake pedal assembly. Brake pedals were moving out of position because a pivot pin wasn't attached correctly.An owner reported to CR that a squeaky brake issue persisted after a trip to the dealer, who claimed to have solved the problem. Another said the brake calipers were bad, cutting short the lifespan of the rotors, which forced a trip to the dealer for a replacement.\n\nThere were plenty of complaints  to CR about the in-car electronics. According to one person, if another party used AirPlay, the only way to reset it was to switch off the vehicle, then open the door. Another person said the radio had delays when switching from one Sirius XM channel to another. One driver said all the warning lights began flashing simultaneously, necessitating a trip to the dealer.\n\nAuto manufacturers are still trying to crack the code of how to produce a highly reliable all-electric pickup truck. The 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning is an excellent example of the problems they face. Ford has long since perfected the process of turning out traditional internal combustion engine versions of the F-150, so the company had a solid basis on which to begin work on the electric version. But the technology necessary for an electric powertrain has proved just as troublesome to master for Ford as for others. The Lightning also has issues with its in-car electronics. The problems were so bad that CR gave both the truck's powertrain and its electronics only a 2 on a scale of 1 to 5 for reliability. Overall, the truck managed a 38 on reliability from Consumer Reports.\n\nThe 2024 F-150 Lightning has four recalls. The first was issued at the close of 2024 for the suspension. Drivers could lose the ability to steer and control the large truck due to a control arm becoming detached. The other three recalls were spread throughout 2025. At the beginning of that year, a recall was announced to prevent the vehicle from catching fire because of a battery short circuit. In the spring, there was another recall for the suspension. The same control arm problem needed to be re-addressed. The year ended with a powertrain recall. Vehicles were losing their ability to remain in park. Trucks were rolling away, threatening to cause accidents.\n\nUnlock your financial potential. Add Money Digest to your preferred sources for smart money insights!",

For example, Susan grew up without a lot of money, and while she often deprives herself of small expenditures like pedicures, she also has a hard time saying no to her kids when it comes to big-ticket items.\n\nBut, according to Sethi, one of their biggest problems has to do with their financial advisor.\n\nIn a more recent YouTube video posted to Sethi’s channel, he states, “I would never pay a percentage of assets under management (2).”\n\nPercentage-based fees grow as your wealth grows, which means you can end up paying an ever-increasing sum to your advisor.\n\nBut Sethi clarified he’s not against working with a professional, saying “I would, and have, happily paid a financial advisor to help me out, to take a second look at my asset allocation.”\n\nSethi advocates for fixed advisory fees — which are a safer way to keep more of your investment gains as your wealth grows.\n\nAs for Jeff, he has two brokerage accounts managed by an advisor charging a 1.24% fee.\n\n“I generally feel as though most people are good and they’re not trying to rip us off,” Susan said.\n\nBut when she asked their financial advisor about his fee, “he told me, ‘oh, it’s roughly around 1%.’ I’ll never forget, he made this face like, oh, it’s not that much.”",

    "title": "I flew drones on Ukraine's fiercest battlefield. The last few months laid bare the limits of today's drone warfare.",
    "description": "Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, a commander of a drone team, told Business Insider what it was like flying in the heavy fog that Russia used to its advantage.",
    "fullText": "Dimko Zhluktenko is a drone operator who provides vital data to defend Ukraine's positions.\n\nThe sergeant last deployed to Pokrovsk, a key battleground where Ukraine said it was outnumbered.\n\nHe says Ukraine needs more than drones to stop Russia's brutal advance.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, an ISR drone team leader in Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces. He deployed in 2025 near Pokrovsk, a key city that Russia said it captured in early December.\n\nBusiness Insider has verified his role in the Ukrainian armed forces. The article has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore the full-scale war, I was a software engineer, working for companies in San Francisco, New Zealand, and Germany.\n\nToday, I lead a team of five to six Ukrainian drone operators. Our task is to use high-flying drones to provide reconnaissance data to our troops and commanders.\n\nWith our intelligence, artillery such as HIMARS and drone strike teams can target Russian equipment and soldiers, often before they can even reach the front lines.\n\nWe were redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in August because the fighting there had become so intense. Because drone operators are priority targets in the war, we would spend our dayslong rotations in houses and underground bunkers outside the city.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the weather was sunny and ideal for flying.\n\nBut the end of October was a disaster for us. Ukraine turns foggy in the autumn, with thick and low clouds that can stack from 100 meters to 300 meters above the ground.\n\nThese are so thick that no infrared camera or thermal camera can see through them, and caused many days to be completely no-go for flying for our types of drones.\n\nAt the time, the Russians took advantage of the clouds, using them to cover their advance on foot and in vehicles. Given the weather, the number of personnel they sacrificed to take the city, and our limited resources, there was eventually no viable way for us to defend Pokrovsk forever.\n\nUkraine is dependent on drone warfare. It has carried us through the terrible and scary times of these Russian assaults, and it has changed the face of war. For the entire summer of 2025, for example, I saw a tank only twice on the battlefield.\n\nDrones are cheap and effective, and if we had an infinite number of drones, we would have been working 24/7 to fight the Russians in Pokrovsk.\n\nBut we don't have infinite drones, so in the meantime, we need other strike tools and resources, such as more artillery fire and troops. War is complex, and drones cannot be its only solution.\n\nIn normal conditions, we fly our drones four times a day, with each flight lasting about three to four hours and sometimes into the night. It's tiring, but worth it, because you can make an enormous difference for Ukrainian defenders. We can spot where Russian forces are moving, denying them the element of surprise, and scout for assets such as air defenses and artillery for commanders to strike.\n\nRecon drone operators like us rely heavily on visual navigation. We study Pokrovsk so closely that, even when our drone is being spoofed, we can determine our flying location simply by the shape of the terrain or landmarks.\n\nWhen the foggy season comes, we try to make the most of any good visibility. Sometimes, you can get lucky and perform five flights in a five-day rotation.\n\nHowever, there were days when we found ourselves sitting in a house, just waiting for the weather to clear.\n\nYou can try to fly under the clouds, but going low means our bulky drones are more easily spotted and destroyed. Since we have limited tools, we try to preserve them and not use them recklessly.\n\nStill, on days with strong winds, there's a chance that the clouds may break slightly and give you glimpses of the battlefield. Sometimes, when visibility is bad but not impossible to work with, we must risk flying in such weather, especially if our troops are defending against a major assault.\n\nIn late summer, the situation in Pokrovsk was becoming increasingly problematic, both on the ground and in the sky. Back in the day, we would help long-range artillery focus on the Russian rear.\n\nI began to notice that Russia's tactics were making an impact around September.\n\nAcross the warzone, their strategy is to find our limit and overwhelm it with the smallest number of soldiers needed to seize our positions.\n\nIt is simple mathematics. Initially, they would send around 10 soldiers. If that wasn't enough, they would send 20. Then they would try 30.\n\nDay by day, they increase the number of troops and equipment. Their goal is to create a situation where we don't have enough drones to counter the amount of attacking infantry.\n\nTo eliminate an assault of 50 guys, all spread out, we'd need at least 150 drones and artillery, which is difficult for us to organize with our limited resources.\n\nWhen we were working in Pokrovsk, there were already areas of the city where the Russians had advanced, so the fighting area was porous and undefined.\n\nIf we had more troops, we could have held out for much longer and performed more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIf we had more recon drones, our team could have flown over Pokrovsk nonstop, working despite the clouds.\n\nWith more first-person-view strike drones, our pilots could continue to find and attack the Russians closer to the ground.\n\nBut we don't have enough. So, we need other strike tools besides FPV drones, even though they account for about 80% of our kills on Russians.\n\nIronically, some of these tools have disappeared because warfare has changed so much. Mortars might have helped, but we mostly stopped using them — the battlefield is now so transparent that it is a suicide mission to ride around close to the front line in your pickup truck with a mortar.\n\nWhat we definitely need is artillery ammunition. Last year, some HIMARS units I worked with were rationed to four strikes a week.\n\nOther artillery units were limited to just three artillery shells a day. We would find them a target, and they would say: \"We don't have any more for today. Sorry, guys.\"\n\nThe weather in this season means it is still what drone pilots call our \"low season.\" At the same time, the terrain is now not too muddy, so it is the perfect time for Russians to attack.\n\nThis month, I am redeploying to Dnipro. The fight continues.",

    "title": "The One Bread—Yes, Bread—Registered Dietitians Want Women Over 50 To Eat More Of",
    "description": "A bread that supports healthy aging? Yes, please!",
    "fullText": "Once you reach a certain age, you may find yourself reaching for the bread basket less often. While any food can fit into an overall healthy diet, bread tends to get a bad rap—particularly white bread. You’ve probably heard that bread can spike blood sugar or that it can lead to weight gain because of its high carbohydrate content.\n\nThese concerns aren’t totally unfounded, especially when it comes to highly refined breads that are low in fiber and digested quickly. As we get older, blood sugar regulation and insulin sensitivity can become more challenging, which is one reason many people start rethinking their carb choices. At the same time, overly restricting foods you enjoy can make healthy eating feel unsustainable—and that often backfires.\n\nPSA: There’s no need for bread shaming. That said, some types of bread are more nutrient-rich than others. For example, 100% whole wheat bread is higher in fiber than many other types of bread, which is a nutrient virtually everyone can benefit from getting more of.\n\nFiber supports digestion, helps keep cholesterol in check, and plays a role in maintaining steady energy levels throughout the day. It’s also associated with a lower risk of chronic conditions that become more common with age, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Choosing breads made from intact or minimally processed grains can make a meaningful difference in how your body responds to them.\n\nThere’s even a type of bread that’s linked to healthy aging due to its unique nutritional makeup, and if you’re 50 or older, you can benefit from eating it regularly.\n\n🩺\nSome breads get a lot of love. Fluffy focaccia, gut-healthy sourdough (the baking project that got us through COVID), nutrient-rich multi-grain…But if you’ve been overlooking rye bread, it’s time to give it the attention it deserves. According to registered dietitians we talked to, its nutritional makeup makes it an essentially beneficial food for people 50 and older.\n\nRegistered dietitian Melissa Rifkin, RD, says that rye bread is a particularly good source of magnesium and B vitamins, two nutrients that are key for healthy aging.\n\n“For women 50 and older, magnesium supports bone density, heart health and may help with muscle cramps and sleep quality. B vitamins are important for cognitive health, energy levels and reducing fatigue—especially since absorption of certain B vitamins can decline with age,” she tells Parade.\n\nIf constantly feeling fatigued is something you struggle with, switching from white bread to rye bread could help. Registered dietitian May Zhu, RD, says that both magnesium and B vitamins play a role in how energized we feel.\n\n“Magnesium supports over 300 enzymatic reactions, including energy production, muscle and nerve function and bone health. B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism, converting food into usable energy. Together, they support cellular energy production and overall metabolic function,” she shares.\n\nBoth dietitians also point out that rye bread is higher in fiber than many other types of bread. This means that it won’t spike blood sugar as much, which is another reason why it can help prevent feeling fatigued.\n\nIn fact, its fiber content is another reason why Rikfin and Zhu say rye bread is so beneficial. “Adults should aim for 25 to 38 grams daily,\" Zhu reveals. \"Whole-grain rye bread can contribute to this goal. Generally, two slices provide 10 to 12 grams. The soluble fiber in rye specifically may support digestive regularity and cholesterol management.\" So if you’re dealing with constipation (something that becomes more common with age), incorporating rye bread into your diet can help.\n\nEvery type of bread has its own benefits, but there are some nutritional qualities specific to rye bread that truly make it stand out when compared to other breads.\n\n“Whole-grain rye bread is one of the most nutrient-dense bread options available. Compared to white bread and even many whole-wheat breads, rye typically provides more fiber, magnesium, potassium and antioxidants. Its dense structure also contributes to slower digestion and greater satiety,” Rifkin explains.\n\nAs previously mentioned, one benefit of rye bread is that it doesn’t spike blood sugar as much as white bread. “Whole-grain rye bread causes a slower, more gradual rise in blood sugar than white bread. This is due to its higher fiber content, which slows carbohydrate absorption. Rye bread has a lower glycemic response than white bread, even though total carbohydrate content is similar, making it a better option for maintaining stable blood sugar,” Rifkin says.\n\nWhen shopping for rye bread, she recommends looking for “100% whole-grain rye” or “whole rye flour” to ensure that what you’re buying is as nutrient-rich as possible. “Not all rye breads are created equal—some are mostly refined wheat flour with a little rye added for flavor,” she says.\n\nTo round out the nutritional profile of your snack or meal, she suggests pairing the whole-grain rye bread with foods with protein and unsaturated fats, such as eggs, fish, avocado or nut butter. That way, you’ll get even more nutritional value out of it.\n\nAs you can see, bread can absolutely add nutritional value to your diet. Rye not give it a try?\n\nMelissa Rifkin, RD, registered dietitian\n\nMay Zhu, RDN, registered dietitian\n\nThompson, H.J. and Brick, M.A. (2016).

    "description": "A look at the Patriots’ game day roster for their wild card matchup on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots offensive line proved a model of stability early on in the season, starting the same five players in 10 of their first 11 weeks of the season. However, starting with their win over the Bengals idn late November, the team had to begin relying on its backups: left tackle Will Campbell and left guard Jared Wilson both suffered injuries that prompted them to miss some time.\n\nOn Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers, the Patriots’ starting five will be back together again for the first time since that game in Cincinnati. Not only is Campbell ready for a second straight week after being activated from injured reserve, Wilson also has been cleared from concussion protocol.\n\nWith them back in the lineup, and both center Garrett Bradbury and right tackle Morgan Moses overcoming the illnesses that held them out of practice earlier in the week, the Patriots O-line is back again just in time for the playoffs to begin.\n\nNew England’s full game day roster versus L.A. looks as follows:\n\nQuarterback (2): Drake Maye (10), Joshua Dobbs (11)\n\nRunning back (4): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), D’Ernest Johnson (34 | KR), Jack Westover (37 | FB/TE)\n\nWide receiver (5): Kayshon Boutte (9), Stefon Diggs (8), Kyle Williams (18), DeMario Douglas (3), Efton Chism III (86)\n\nTight end (2): Hunter Henry (85), Austin Hooper (81)\n\nOffensive tackle (4): Will Campbell (66 | LT), Morgan Moses (76 | RT), Vederian Lowe (59), Thayer Munford Jr. (74)\n\nInterior offensive line (4): Jared Wilson (58 | LG), Garrett Bradbury (65 | C), Mike Onwenu (71 | RG), Ben Brown (77)\n\nInterior defensive line (5): Milton Williams (97), Christian Barmore (90), Cory Durden (94), Eric Gregory (55), Leonard Taylor III (93 | PS elevation)\n\nDefensive edge (4): Harold Landry III (2), K’Lavon Chaisson (44), Anfernee Jennings (33), Elijah Ponder (91)\n\nLinebacker (6): Robert Spillane (14), Christian Elliss (53), Jack Gibbens (51), Jahlani Tavai (48), Marte Mapu (15), Chad Muma (49)\n\nCornerback (5): Christian Gonzalez (0), Carlton Davis III (7), Marcus Jones (25 | PR), Charles Woods (22), Kobee Minor (19)\n\nSafety (4): Jaylinn Hawkins (21), Craig Woodson (31), Dell Pettus (24), Brenden Schooler (41)\n\nSpecialists (3): Andy Borregales (36 | K), Bryce Baringer (17 | P/H), Julian Ashby (47 | LS)\n\nThe Patriots defense received a boost on Sunday. Besides edge defender Harold Landry being cleared from the knee injury that had held him out the previous two games and landed him on the questionables list heading into the weekend, off-ball linebacker Robert Spillane is also about to make his comeback. Spillane had missed four straight games because of an ankle injury.\n\nWith the duo back in action, their respective position groups will see some change. On the edge, Anfernee Jennings and Elijah Ponder will likely resume more rotational roles again, while Brady Swinson was deemed inactive. Off the ball, Jack Gibbens returns to the top backup role he held before Spillane’s absence.\n\nInactives (7): QB Tommy DeVito (16), WR Jeremiah Webb (29 | PS elevation), TE C.J. Dippre (82), OT Marcus Bryant (52), OL Caedan Wallace (70), DT Khyiris Tonga (95), ED Bradyn Swinson (43)\n\nPractice squad (14): RB Elijah Mitchell (45), WR John Jiles (83), WR Brandon Smith (80), TE Marshall Lang (—), OL Sebastian Gutierrez (—), OL Brenden Jaimes (61), OL Andrew Rupcich (67), OL Mehki Butler (63), DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (98), DT Fabien Lovett Sr. (96), LB Amari Gainer (99), LB Otis Reese (54), S Richie Grant (39), S John Saunders Jr. (23)\n\nPractice squad/injured (3): RB Craig Reynolds (49), LB Darius Harris (42), TE Thomas Odukoya (88 | IPPP)\n\nReserve/injured (11): FB Brock Lampe, OT Yasir Durant, CB Marcellas Dial Jr., DT Jaquelin Roy, RB Lan Larison, RB Deneric Prince, DT Isaiah Iton, RB Antonio Gibson, CB Alex Austin (IR-R), RB Terrell Jennings, DT Joshua Farmer, WR Mack Hollins\n\nReserve/retired (1): OL Wes Schweitzer\n\nThe Patriots elevated two players from their practice squad for Sunday’s contest, but only one of them is actually in line to play. Whereas Leonard Taylor will likely factor into the interior defensive line mix for a third game this season, Jeremiah Webb will watch the action from the sideline. With Kayshon Boutte being given the green light, there is no place on him on the game day roster.\n\nNew England’s playoff opener against the Chargers is set for an 8 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.",

    "fullText": "Leylah Fernandez will have big plans for her 2026 season on the WTA Tour, which she has already got underway.\n\nFernandez lost her opening match at the Brisbane International, where the 13th seed was beaten by Dayana Yastremska.\n\nThe Canadian, who lost 6-1, 6-2, now turns her focus to the Adelaide International, where she will play both singles and doubles.\n\nFernandez will play against Diana Shnaider in the former, while she and Timea Babos will take on Sofia Kenin and Laura Siegemund in the latter.\n\nAhead of the tournament, the 2021 US Open runner-up shared insight into her personal life by answering various questions on her Instagram.\n\nOne question focused on her career if she wasn’t a tennis player, to which the Canadian said: “100% I’d be a soccer/futbol player.”\n\nFernandez also shared her background in another answer, explaining: “I am Canadian. I was born in Montreal, Canada, speak French and English.\n\n“My mom was born in Toronto, Canada, and my grandparents are from the Philippines. My dad was born in Ecuador and that is why I speak Spanish.”\n\nFernandez is evidently a keen football fan, but it’s clear she made the right decision by moving into tennis.\n\nThe 23-year-old boasts five career titles on the WTA Tour, and once reached as high as number 13 in the world rankings.\n\nHer only Grand Slam final appearance came at the US Open back in 2021, when she lost out to Emma Raducanu.\n\nShe’s also experienced Grand Slam doubles heartache, having lost the 2023 French Open doubles final playing with Taylor Townsend.\n\nFernandez is currently ranked 22nd on the WTA Tour, and she will be the 22nd seed at the upcoming Australian Open.",

In bad news, Lucas Hernandez has been unexpectedly ruled out.\n\nPSG will face Paris FC this Monday in the Coupe de France round of 16 without any reinforcements from the medical room. Luis Enrique has received no good news from the infirmary in recent hours, as shown by the day's medical update, which the club has just released.\n\nThe three injury absentees remain the same. But to these expected absences has been added bad news, namely that Lucas Hernandez is ill and \"is resting.\"\n\nRegarding the three injured players, PSG specifies that \"Quentin Ndjantou continues his treatment protocol,\" while Kang In Lee and Matvei Safonov are doing adapted work.\"\n\nThe return is relatively close for the latter two, particularly the South Korean. For the Russian goalkeeper, a return to competition was previously mentioned for late January or early February after his left-hand fracture.\n\nGiven that Achraf Hakimi and Ibrahim Mbaye are still involved in the Africa Cup of Nations – the Moroccan fullback and Senegalese winger will play their respective semifinals next Wednesday – this means there will be no fewer than six absentees on PSG's side for this second derby of the season against Paris FC.\n\nThe medical update before PSG vs. Paris FC:\n\nQuentin Ndjantou continues his treatment protocol.\n\nKang In Lee and Matvei Safonov are doing adapted work.\n\nRoundtablesports is Free to join!

We'll see how the week goes and see how he can help us.”\n\nSafety has been a turnstile for weeks opposite second-year standout Calen Bullock. C.J. Gardner-Johnson initially was the starter before being released in Week 3 due to his role with the defense. M.J. Stewart, who suffered a quadriceps injury earlier this season, is out for the season. Houston hasn't activated veteran defensive back Jimmie Ward yet, instead relying on former practice squad players like K'Von Wallace and Myles Bryant.\n\nReed, who had worked his way into a starting role, had a metal plate placed inside his forearm after making a tackle against the Colts in Week 13. Before that, he was named a starter after recording 11 tackles and a fumble recovery against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nA sixth-round draft pick out of Penn State, Reed was a former second-team All-Big Ten Conference selection who has a hard-hitting presence. In seven games, Reed has totaled 14 tackles, a pass breakup and recovered a fumble.\n\nKickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. on ESPN.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: Jaylen Reed injury update: Will Texans rookie DB play vs. Steelers?",

    "fullText": "Was Jauan Jennings ever a quarterback? 49ers WR connects with Christian McCaffrey on Philly special trick play vs. Eagles originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith George Kittle out for the remainder of the game and the offense stalled, the San Francisco 49ers had to get creative against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nKyle Shanahan dialed up a beauty of a play in the third quarter, with WR Jauan Jennings throwing a touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey to give the 49ers the lead.\n\n49ers fans -- and Kansas City Chiefs fans -- remember that connection well. Jennings previously hit McCaffrey for a touchdown in Super Bowl 58. \nThe design of the play was eerily similar to the famed trick play that helped their opponent win Super Bowl LII in 2018.\n\nHere's a look at the trick play and Jennings' history as a quarterback.\n\nLIVE:Follow updates from 49ers vs. Eagles in wild-card playoff game\n\nShanahan dug deep into his playbook on first-and-10 with the 49ers in field goal range. Brock Purdy handed off to Skyy Moore, who tossed it backwards to Jennings, only for Jennings to run to his right and find a wide-open McCaffrey for the go-ahead touchdown.\n\nJAUAN JENNINGS TD PASS TO CMC\n\nSFvsPHI on FOX/FOX One\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/18VxTpTKgj\n\nThe play instantly breathed life into a 49ers offense that hadn't scored since the first half and hadn't scored a touchdown since the opening drive of the game.\n\nHere's a closer look at why a pass from Jennings might have been no surprise for those who know his background.\n\nMORE:What to know about George Kittle's Achilles injury\n\nJennings committed to Tennessee as a quarterback in the class of 2015, after playing the position at Blackman High School in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He actually ranked ahead of Sam Darnold, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow in his class, according to 247 Sports.\n\nJennings was converted into a wide receiver under Butch Jones with the Volunteers, a decision that ultimately helped him become an NFL Draft pick and eventually a standout piece of the 49ers' offense. Shanahan knows Jennings, strengths, however, and the receiver has two playoff touchdown passes to his name despite never attempting a pass in the regular season.\n\nThe first touchdown pass of Jennings' playoff career came in Super Bowl 58, when he threw a dangerous pass across the field to McCaffrey, who ran it in for a touchdown to extend the 49ers' lead over the Chiefs.\n\nJAUAN JENNINGS THROWING A TD IN THE SUPER BOWL #VFLpic.twitter.com/cYNc169Yhw\n\n— Barstool Rocky Top (@BarstoolTenn) February 12, 2024\n\nJennings also had a receiving touchdown in the game, but San Francisco would lose in overtime.",

Join the discussion in the comments below.\n\nHere is some basic information to help guide you through the game:\n\nHow to watch the game – TV schedule and online streaming information;\n\nFollow along with 49ers fans at Niners Nation;\n\nEagles full regular season schedule;\n\nNote: This is an open thread. Discuss the game and stay tuned for new threads after each quarter.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\n4Q – 2:54 [Eagles 19, Niners 24] — With the help of some penalties. The 49ers were able to take the lead back just before the two-minute warning. They opted to kick an extra point instead of going for two, but they missed and only hold a 4-point buffer.\n\n4Q – 8:00 [Eagles 19, Niners 17] — The Eagles were forced to settle for a field goal, but Jake Elliott was able to connect on a 33 yarder for Philadelphia to retake the lead.\n\n4Q – 14:52 [Eagles 16, Niners 17] — Brock Purdy connected with Christian McCaffrey for a 29-yard touchdown to take the lead for the first time since the first quarter. To make matters worse, Jalen Carter was flagged for roughing the passer which was a penalty imposed on the next play.\n\n3Q – 2:20 [Eagles 16, Niners 10] — After several three-and-outs to start the second half, the Eagles were able to get into field goal range, and Jake Elliott made a 41-yard kick to extend their lead.\n\n2Q – 2:50 [Eagles 13, Niners 10] — The 49ers had to settle for a field goal after Jordan Davis made two clutch stops to force them into fourth down. Eddy Pineiro nailed a 36-yard field goal to inch closer to the Eagles before halftime.\n\nNotable: 49ers TE George Kittle had to be carted off the field during the drive after suffering what appeared to be a torn Achilles.\n\n2Q – 6:08 [Eagles 13, Niners 7] — Dallas Goedert scored his second touchdown of the day on a nine-yard TD pass on 4th-and-2. The 16-play drive had a little bit of everything, including their first tush push of the game, and some Tank Bigsby carries.\n\n1Q – 6:16 [Eagles 6, Niners 7] — The Eagles offense was (surprisingly) quick to respond and scored points off a 10-play drive that was super run-heavy, and ended with a Dallas Goedert TD — his 12th of the season! Unfortunately, Jake Elliott’s issues don’t seem resolved as he missed what could be a very critical point-after attempt.\n\n1Q – 11:51 [Eagles 0, Niners 7] — Well, that wasn’t a great start from the Eagles defense. Vic Fangio’s group gave up a frustrating 61-yard catch and followed that up by allowing several more plays that resulted in the 49ers scoring the first points of the game. Brock Purdy connected with Demarcus Robinson in the back of the endzone for six.\n\nNote: if the tracker isn’t properly loading for you, you can CLICK HERE.\n\nA Twitter List by BleedingGreen",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Like the Pacers, the Celtics are going through this season without their franchise player as Boston's Jayson Tatum and Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton both out for the year with Achilles tendon tears. However, the Celtics might also be missing their other All-Star when they play the Pacers at 7:30 p.m. Monday at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nJaylen Brown -- a four-time All-Star as well as a one-time All-NBA pick and the 2024 NBA Finals MVP -- wasn't on the Celtics initial injury report on Sunday but he was added in the evening, listed as doubtful with back spasms. Brown has missed just two games this season and is making a strong case for both All-Star and All-NBA nods and even a darkhorse MVP argument in Tatum's absence. He ranks sixth in the NBA with 29.5 points per game -- which would be a career-high if it holds up throughout the year on 49.5% shooting and 37.6% 3-point shooting. He's also averaging 6.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.0 steals per game. The surprising Celtics are 24-14 and entered Sunday's action in a tie with the Knicks for second place in the Eastern Conference.\n\nCeltics sharp-shooting wing Sam Hauser -- who made 7 of 8 3-pointers for 23 points against the Pacers in Boston's Dec. 26 win at Gainbridge -- is listed as questionable with right hamstring tightness. He's averaging 7.8 points per game and shooting 38.6% from 3-point range. Wing Josh Minott, who signed with the Celtics this summer after three years with Minnesota, is out with a left ankle sprain.\n\nPacers guard Andrew Nembhard is listed as questionable with lower back soreness for the third straight game after missing Thursday's game but posting 29 points and nine assists in Saturday's win over the Heat. Guard Bennedict Mathurin (right thumb sprain) and center Isaiah Jackson (concussion) are still out, though coach Rick Carlisle said Jackson has cleared concussion protocol but has to work himself back into shape. Forward Obi Toppin is out until at least February after surgery to repair a stress fracture in his right foot.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Boston's Jaylen Brown doubtful against Pacers with back spasms",

    "fullText": "Dan Muse hasn’t reacted via lineup changes to losses very frequently this season, however today changes on that front. All three of the top lines are mixed up a bit, Anthony Mantha moves up to the top line, Ben Kindel and Tommy Novak join Justin Brazeau on a new-look line, and perhaps most inexplicably of all Kevin Hayes is going to center Evgeni Malkin and Yegor Chinakhov. It’s the type of lineup that works and Muse looks smart, or it doesn’t and a lot of people will be questioning. Connor Clifton is back for his first game since December 20th and only his second since 12/14 after a long streak of healthy scratches.\n\nToday's lineup in Boston.#LetsGoPens pic.twitter.com/jAYBMa1Rtf\n\n— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) January 11, 2026\n\nThe home Bruins are going with these lines and backup goalie Joonas Korpisalo on the back-half of their b2b.\n\nElias and Eyssimont are in. pic.twitter.com/G5blhYOL7e\n\n— Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) January 11, 2026\n\nTommy Novak goes to the box early. Boston appears to score later on but after further review Sean Kuraly punched the puck in with his glove and that isn’t allowed. No goal after all.\n\nBrazeau takes a penalty, Pittsburgh kills it off without much trouble. Soon after, the Bruins score a good goal. Viktor Arvidsson chops a backhander while not even facing the net after a scramble that slips under Stuart Skinner.\n\n7️⃣1️⃣ SNEAKS IT THROUGH pic.twitter.com/mUjw7e5IKi\n\n— Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) January 11, 2026\n\nThe period comes to a close much like it did throughout; with a Penguin in the penalty box. This time Evgeni Malkin for high-sticking. Pittsburgh again stays strong down a player.\n\nDecent first but the Pens were in penalty trouble too much and couldn’t get off to the start they were looking for. 1-0 Boston after one with an even 10 shots for each side.\n\nPittsburgh kills off the short carryover and gets a few looks at the Boston net but can’t beat Korpisalo. Kulak bobbles the puck and play goes the other way, Kulak has to hook Mark Kastelic to obstruct the breakaway and it’s yet another Penguin penalty to kill off, which they do.\n\nThe frequent trips to the penalty box continues, Kulak flipped the puck over the glass for the delay of game call with another job well done for the Pittsburgh PK.\n\nThe worm turns, Kastelic is given goalie interference penalty. Kastelic is none too pleased with Skinner for falling back in animated manner but given the situation it was bound to happen for the Penguins to finally get a shot with their power play for the first time on the night. It barely gets setup, though Brazeau does ring a deflected shot off the post shortly after the power play expires.\n\nBoth teams trade chances in the late stages, Sidney Crosby puts a couple of nice backhand shots that Korpisalo is right there to match.\n\nStill 1-0 Boston with Pittsburgh either getting in their own way or failing to get a lot going through 40 minutes.\n\nBrazeau is back to the penalty box early on, lucky for him the Bruins take a penalty 30 seconds into their power play to negate it.\n\nThe rest of the period trickles away without much going on. Pittsburgh pulls Skinner with about two minutes to go, they use the time with 1:24 remaining to regroup and give a breather. Doesn’t help and time ticks to 0:00 without the Pens finding a goal today.\n\nMalkin hasn’t taken any faceoffs in the three games he’s been back from his shoulder injury, noticed in this one that Hayes got kicked out of the circle by the linesman and Malkin didn’t react even a little to move a muscle and let Chinakhov take it instead. Might speak to the status of that shoulder right now for him to be completely out for taking draws.\n\nIt was a bad-good-bad situation with the Pittsburgh penalty kill today. The bad was taking five penalties in the first half of the game (to a curious 0 for the opponent). The good was the PK was very effective to only allow a handful of shots, very few of which were dangerous. The ultimate effect was bad to have 32% of the first 31 minutes of the game being spent as Boston power play time, making it impossible for the Pittsburgh skill players to get in a rhythm and get a lot going for themselves.\n\nThere’s a stat floating around social media with the Pens record with Hayes out of the record (something like 15-4-2) and with him in the lineup (now 6-10-7). Similar, but opposite to the record with Lizotte being very good, there’s some correlation issues there, but maybe not as many. Everyone likes Hayes who is a good guy and all, not sure why he needs to be on the ice with Malkin’s line. Many a person got hung up as Hayes as “second line center” this game, which was technically his placement but with only 10:19 of icetime Hayes was the player with the least amount of action today. The line is attached to doesn’t matter so much as the fact that if he’s in the lineup at all it’s creating a disadvantage for the Penguins.\n\nIt’s always startling how in the NHL there’s little difference between being in a groove turning into getting stuck in a rut. Last weekend at this time the Pens were coming off a win vs Detroit scoring four goals on Saturday and then a thrilling OT win against Columbus that produced five goals. Fast forward to this time, they score one against Calgary (hardly a defensive giant, and on their backup goal) and then have another backup goalie throw out a great performance today. Sometimes it do be like that with the highs and lows of a long season cresting and falling like waves in the ocean.\n\nThe bummer is that Boston didn’t have that much going on, just four shots in the second period and four \n\nThe Pens will head back home and try to shake off the doldrums they find themselves going through right now. They’ll likely need to do so soon since the mighty Tampa Bay Lightning are up next.",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox will need to pivot if they want to add an impact bat now that Alex Bregman has reportedly agreed to a deal with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nMany experts predict that the Red Sox will now shift their focus to Bo Bichette, who they have reportedly been talking to as well. However, they could look to make a trade to fill their need for a bat.\n\nThe Red Sox have been active traders already this winter. However, they could suddenly match up with the Cubs for a trade after they stole Bregman from them. With the addition of Bregman to Chicago’s infield, they have an extra infielder.\n\nWith Bregman slotted in as the everyday third baseman, the Cubs face a decision with Nico Hoerner and Matt Shaw. Shaw made his debut last season and was one of the top prospects in the organization. He is under club control through 2031.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoerner has already been floated in trade rumors and is one year away from free agency. The Red Sox could use him to play second base, allowing Marcelo Mayer to play third base.\n\nHe was a Silver Slugger finalist last season and is a two-time Gold Glover at second base. He slashed .297/.345/.394 last season, but he could put up even better numbers at Fenway Park.\n\nHoerner would hit the open market after next season, but by then the hope would be that Kristian Campbell is ready to be the everyday second baseman, like the team hoped when they extended him last season.\n\nIt may seem odd to suggest the Red Sox trade with the team that just swiped their top free agent target. However, Craig Breslow has navigated the trade market well, and Hoerner is suddenly more available than ever.\n\nMLB Rumors: Why Red Sox’s Contract Offer Made Alex Bregman Uncomfortable",

    "fullText": "It’s been a great weekend for Will Stein and the Kentucky Wildcats. Stein was at the Wildcats’ game Saturday night when they came off the mats to beat Mississippi State 92-69 while also scoring several big football commitments.\n\nSunday, the Wildcats may have found their starting right tackle out of the transfer portal in UTEP offensive tackle Mark Robinson. KSR’s Jacob Polacheck broke the news first.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 320-pound Robinson is coming off his first season as a Miner after transferring to UTEP from Southeastern University following the 2024 season.\n\nRobinson has had a logical progression through the portal in his three seasons of college football, and now he will gear up for his first season in the SEC.\n\nThis year at UTEP, Robinson started all 12 regular-season games at left tackle for the Miners. He played a total of 813 snaps, finishing with a season grade of 54.9 per Pro Football Focus while being named an All-Conference USA honorable mention.\n\nIn 2024 with Southeastern, Robinson was named the Sun Conference Freshman of the Year and was second-team All-Sun Conference while starting all nine games at left tackle.\n\nRobinson will have two seasons of eligibility at Kentucky. While he primarily played left tackle, Robinson will be a candidate to move over to the right side and compete for the starting right tackle position, being that Tennessee left tackle Lance Heard also committed to the Wildcats this weekend and is a far more proven commodity at that blindside spot.\n\nAs of now, Robinson’s only competition at right tackle would be returning backup Malachi Wood, so Kentucky may look to add another tackle before it’s all said and done.",

    "description": "Follow along for live updates from the Philadelphia Eagles' NFC Wild Card game against the San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field.",
    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA — Greetings from the press box at Lincoln Financial Field, where the Philadelphia Eagles will face the San Francisco 49ers in Sunday’s NFC Wild Card game.\n\nThe Eagles (11-6) and 49ers (12-5) will kick off at 4:40 p.m. The game between the NFC East champions and the NFC West squad will air nationally on FOX.\n\nIf they beat the 49ers on Sunday, the Eagles’ road to the Super Bowl will head to Soldier Field, where they’ll face the Chicago Bears in the NFC Divisional round.\n\nThe defending Super Bowl champs will have to take down San Francisco without one of their best players.\n\nOffensive tackle Lane Johnson is inactive despite optimism that he would be able to suit up against the 49ers. Johnson, the future Hall of Famer and five-time All-Pro, will now miss his eighth straight game with a Lisfranc foot injury suffered in Week 11.\n\nVeteran reserve Fred Johnson will start in his place at right tackle. The Eagles are 3-4 this season and 18-27 overall since 2013 without Lane Johnson in the lineup.\n\nStill, Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and the Eagles are 5.5-point betting favorites against San Francisco, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nOur prediction? Eagles win, 24-16.\n\nStay tuned for updates from the Linc throughout the game.\n\nJalen Hurts’ 4th down pass is incomplete to Goedert on 4th and 11 at the SF 21. Thrown into triple coverage. Ballgame, after Eagles blew one of their timeouts on 4th down.\n\nDallas Goedert keeps the season alive with 15-yard reception on 4th and 5. It came a play after a drop from AJ Brown over the middle.\n\nTouchdown 49ers. Christian McCaffrey on a 4-yard TD reception short middle from Brock Purdy to give Niners the lead again.\n\nDynamite drive behind McCaffrey, 10 plays over 66 yards taking up 5:06.\n\nIt’s Eddy Pineiro’s turn to miss PAT. He hooks it left and it’s a 4-point game.\n\nField goal Eagles. Jake Elliott hits from 33 yards and Eagles regain lead. Drive was 8 plays, 47 yards over 3:55.\n\nBarkley became the Eagles’ all-time leading rusher in playoff games, passing Brian Westbrook, during the drive.\n\nAnother franchise record for @saquon 😤 pic.twitter.com/vNcEREPQRe\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) January 12, 2026\n\nBarkley, who is over 100 yards rushing, comes up gingerly on 0-yard run. Eagles driving, 6 plays, 41 yards so far to the SF 21.\n\nInterception: Quinyon Mitchell INT again! The All-Pro undercuts a route and picks off Brock Purdy at the PHL 38. His second of the day.\n\nAn awful response from Philly. Penalty and two incompletions lead to 3 and out. 49ers take over at own 31 after 46-yard punt.\n\nTouchdown. San Fran opens fourth quarter with massive TD play. Brock Purdy pitches to Jauan Jennings on jet sweep but he drops to pass and delivers a beauty over the shoulder of Christian McCaffrey for a 29-yard score.\n\nThe play-calling skills disparity between Kyle Shanahan and Eagles OC Kevin Patullo is rearing its head.\n\nSF’s first lead since 6:10 of second quarter.\n\nThe missed extra point on Eagles’ opening score is the difference at the moment.\n\n49ers are driving to close the third quarter. Four plays for 38 yards, including Kyle Jusczcyk 27-yard reception, to reach the PHL 31.\n\nField goal, Eagles. Jake Elliott nails a 41-yard field goal to extend Eagles’ lead to 6 with a short field.\n\nStill a one-score game after Eagles didn’t do a ton even while taking over at SF 48. Not much aggression in the play-calling as Hurts ran a QB draw on 3rd and 13 for 4 yards to set up the field goal.\n\nThe Eagles’ defense is more than holding up its end of the bargain. Birds allow Niners just one yard while forcing a three-and-out. A terrible punt from Tom Morestead gives the Eagles the ball at the SF 46, just a 25-yard net.\n\nThe Eagles offense does nothing with Mitchell’s INT. It’s a three-and-out in part due to a holding penalty on Cam Jurgens on 2nd down.\n\nBoo birds were out ... and I don't blame them after running the ball on 2nd-and-18\n\n— Johnny McGonigal (@jmcgonigal9) January 11, 2026\n\nInterception for the Eagles. Quinyon Mitchell picks off Brock Purdy and Eagles take over at their own 48. It’s the first INT of the year for the All-Pro.\n\nEagles go 3-and-out to open second half. Braden Mann pins San Fran at the 5-yard line with his punt.\n\nIt was an eventful first half to say the least. The Eagles lead thanks to a havoc-creating defense, 71 rushing yards from Saquon Barkley and a pair of well-designed red-zone scores by Dallas Goedert.\n\nThe 49ers, meanwhile, will be without star tight end George Kittle, who was carted off the field and later ruled out with an Achilles injury.\n\nThe Eagles get the ball to start the second half.\n\nThe 49ers have cut into the Eagles’ lead with a 36-yard field goal. But the bigger news on that drive was the loss of George Kittle. The All-Pro tight end had to be carted off with what some are fearing is an Achilles injury.\n\nPrayers up for George Kittle 🙏 pic.twitter.com/BaRVd2sWwp\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 11, 2026\n\nKevin Patullo, take a bow. That was a well-designed drive by the Eagles’ embattled offensive coordinator. The Eagles marched on a 16-play, 94-yard TD drive, capped by a fourth-down, play-action pass to Dallas Goedert. It was Goedert’s second TD of the first half and his 13th of the season.\n\nPatullo mixed it up all drive, including a pass to DeVonta Smith out of the backfield and a nifty screen to Saquon Barkley, who put the San Francisco defense on skates. Good stuff from the Eagles as they take the lead.\n\nGuess who? pic.twitter.com/k3KTU8GYau\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) January 11, 2026\n\nThe Eagles answered San Francisco’s opening touchdown drive with one of their own. The Birds went 63 yards on 10 plays without a single negative play. Saquon Barkley got rolling with a 29-yard gain (and 45 yards total on six carries). The drive was capped by a jet sweep score for tight end Dallas Goedert. Kevin Patullo continues to call it right in the red zone. Jake Elliott missed his XP, though, so San Fran still leads.\n\nDALLAS GOEDERT RUSHING TD 🦅\n\nSFvsPHI on FOX/FOX One\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/mgdxVyxYuk\n\nWell, that’s a less than ideal start by the Birds’ defense. The 49ers score first with a six-play, 76-yard touchdown drive, thanks in large part to a 61-yard catch and run by Demarcus Robinson. The drive was capped on a two-yard scoring strike to Robinson, taking the energy right out of the Lincoln Financial Field crowd.\n\nOn both catches, Robinson burned All-Pro corner Quinyon Mitchell. It’ll be up to Jalen Hurts and Co. to answer.\n\nPURDY TO ROBINSON AGAIN\n\nThis time for a TD 🙌\n\nSFvsPHI on FOX/FOX One\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/jgfhCLVGdA\n\nEagles coach erupts at star WR during tense playoff moment Jan. 11, 2026, 6:12p.m.\n\n49ers star carted off field with serious injury vs. Eagles Jan. 11, 2026, 5:49p.m.\n\nEagles, 49ers have heated exchange at midfield before NFC wild-card game (VIDEO) Jan. 11, 2026, 4:52p.m.\n\nEagles suffer devastating blow before playoff showdown with 49ers Jan. 11, 2026, 3:07p.m.",

    "description": "How can this keep happening?",
    "fullText": "The Wildcats held a double-digit lead early, but were unable to hold on in a hair-pulling 77-75 overtime loss to Rutgers. Northwestern (8-8, 0-5 Big Ten) suffered its fourth loss of five or less points this season, while Rutgers (9-8, 2-4 Big Ten) squeaked out its second victory in Big Ten play.\n\nNick Martinelli led all scorers with a career-high 34 points. Arrinten Page contributed 14, and Jake West put together perhaps his best complete performance as a Wildcat, finishing with nine points, four assists, two rebounds and two blocks, despite missing a game-tying layup in the game’s final seconds.\n\nTariq Francis paced Rutgers with 30 points, with 23 coming in the second half and overtime. Darren Buchanan Jr. had 14 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nNorthwestern relied on four three pointers in the first half to take a double-digit lead. However, they would make just two more threes the rest of the game, leaning heavily upon production inside from Martinelli and Page. While neither team shot exceptionally well from the field — with Northwestern at 41.3% and Rutgers 40.6% — the Scarlet Knights had a little bit more grit through 40 minutes, out-rebounding the ‘Cats 47-40 and making two more free throws, despite having two less attempts at the line.\n\nOut of the gate, head coach Chris Collins chose to roll with a Reid-Clayton-Mullins-Martinelli-Singleton starting lineup. Angelo Ciaravino and Arrinten Page, who have started 12 and 13 games, respectively, for the ‘Cats this season, came off the bench for a second straight game.\n\nJayden Reid opened the scoring with a jumpshot after Jamichael Davis missed two free throws for the Scarlet Knights on their opening possession.\n\nOver the next three minutes, Nick Martinelli poured in a quick nine points, pushing the ‘Cats out to an 11-4 lead. Martinelli, on average, makes just 1.3 three pointers per game, but knocked down two big triples in the opening minutes to give the ‘Cats a hot start in this one.\n\n.@N_Martinelli1 from deep‼️ pic.twitter.com/oTxq7LM60i\n\n— Northwestern Basketball (@NUMensBball) January 11, 2026\n\nOut of a media timeout, Darren Buchanan Jr. connected on a three for Rutgers, but the ‘Cats continued to roll on the offensive end. Northwestern rattled off a 10-2 run off the back of two Jake West three-point jumpers, pushing its lead to 23-11.\n\nThrough the game’s opening ten minutes, the ‘Cats shot 4-for-7 (57.1%) from outside, well above their 30.8% average on the season and their 25.0% clip in the last six games. Martinelli and West’s early threes not only mathematically accelerated Northwestern’s scoring, but more generally opened up space on the floor, allowing for a more fluid offensive operation.\n\nFollowing the ‘Cats’ early run, Rutgers was able to pick up its scoring, pouring in seven points in just two minutes. However, two inside buckets for Arrinten Page, who scored six points in the first half, protected the ‘Cats’ sizable lead.\n\nScoring slowed down for both teams the next several possessions, as the ‘Cats suffered a scoring drought that spanned almost three minutes. Though a strong defensive effort continued to limit Rutgers’ offense, two Christoph Nwuli free throws and a Lino Mark layup allowed the Scarlet Knights to tighten the game to a 27-22 score.\n\nThe teams traded points over the course of a few possessions, but it was Rutgers who went on the next scoring run, finishing the half 10-2 to enter the half down just two points. Shooting just 20% from outside, the Scarlet Knights moved to attack the basket, scoring six of their ten points at the foul line and their other four in the paint.\n\nThough Northwestern led 35-33 at the half, it was a disappointing final ten minutes for the visitors after the 12-point lead they built in the early minutes after a hot start from the perimeter. Martinelli’s 15 points led all scorers, while Buchanan’s ten points led the Scarlet Knights. Neither team found much success scoring in the paint, as the ‘Cats relied on four early three-point buckets for their offensive production, and Rutgers leaned on its nine points from the charity stripe. Though Northwestern was able to shoot 48.3% from the field and 40% on threes, the ‘Cats went 3-for-8 from the free throw line, leaving a few points on the board.\n\nRutgers and Northwestern traded buckets to start the second half, with the Scarlet Knights knocking down three jumpshots—including one three-pointer—and Martinelli building off of his strong first half for the ‘Cats, converting upon two free throws and an inside layup.\n\nAt the 15:36 mark, Rutgers took its first lead of the game when Emmanuel Ogbole slammed home a dunk. Outside of West’s two early three-pointers, the Scarlet Knights’ guards won their defensive assignments against their Northwestern counterparts. With the score 49-47, 35 of Northwestern’s 49 points had come from bigs Martinelli (21), Page (10) and Singleton (4), who kept the ‘Cats in the game in the early part of the second half.\n\nWest’s third three of the game briefly extended a Northwestern scoring run to 7-0. The home team was quick to respond, however, as Tariq Francis connected on two jumpshots to bring the Northwestern lead to 54-52 with 7:37 remaining.\n\nOn Northwestern’s next two-possessions, it continued to apply pressure with its big men, as Martinelli and Page found their way to the charity stripe, each making a pair of free throws. After shooting 37.5% from the free throw line in the first half, Northwestern was much improved in the second half, shooting  10-for-12 (83.3%).\n\nMartinelli was especially involved at the free throw line in the second half, shooting a perfect 8-for-8. Four of those free throws contributed to Martinelli scoring the Wildcats’ last six points, giving Northwestern a 62-56 lead with just four minutes remaining.\n\nFollowing Martinelli’s run, five points from Rutgers’ Jamichael Davis contributed to a swift 9-3 response, cutting Northwestern’s lead to just one point with slightly over a minute to play.\n\nOut of a timeout, Collins was intent on getting Martinelli involved in the action. However, he was swarmed in the post by the Scarlet Knights and unable to get a quality shot, giving Rutgers a chance to take the lead.\n\nOn the other end, Tariq Francis was fouled on a jumpshot by West. At the line, Francis converted on two free throws, giving Rutgers a one-point lead at 0:39. Francis, the Scarlet Knights’ leading scorer this season, came alive in the second half, scoring 16 of Rutgers’ 34 points.\n\nBacks against the wall, Collins continued to put the ball in the hands of the Big Ten’s leading scorer. Unlike the previous possession, it paid off, as the Glenview native connected on a silky jumper from the left wing to put the ‘Cats back in front.\n\nWith 26 seconds remaining, it seemed the ‘Cats just needed one more stop to seal this one in Piscataway. Rather, Rutgers recovered possession of the ball after two missed Francis jumpshots, forcing the ‘Cats to defend three separate shot attempts. On the third, a putback layup by Buchanan, Jordan Clayton committed a shooting foul. However, Buchanan, a 59.0% season free throw shooter, made just one of two at the line, deadlocking the game at 67 as time expired in regulation.\n\nOvertime would be needed to decide this one, as a fired up Martinelli, who scored 31 points in regulation for Northwestern, screamed to encourage the ‘Cats to keep fighting for five more minutes.\n\nAnd, it would be Martinelli who started the scoring in the overtime period. However, Rutgers would respond with a 7-3 scoring run, led by five more points from a red hot Francis. The Scarlet Knights led  76-72 with 1:22 to play in the period.\n\nOn the subsequent possession, Tre Singleton hit iron on a three-point attempt giving the ball back to Rutgers. With another basket bound to decide the game, Page kept the Wildcats alive, blocking Francis’ shot on defense, and then drawing a shooting foul with a hard drive to the basket on offense. Page knocked down both free throws, putting the score at 76-74.\n\nWith 30 seconds to play and the shot clock turned off, Northwestern applied a full court press, forcing them to take a timeout after trapping them in the right corner. After the timeout, the ‘Cats stole the inbounds pass, gaining a chance to tie or take the lead in the game’s final seconds.\n\nDespite a special 34-point performance, Martinelli wasn’t able to save the day for the ‘Cats. Initially, he missed a tough left-handed layup, though the ‘Cats were able to force a jump ball and retain possession on the rebound. On the following possession, Martinelli was fouled and sent to the line, but he missed the second of his two free throws; the ‘Cats still trailed 76-75.\n\nWith just nine seconds remaining, Rutgers inbounded the ball to Buchanan and Northwestern immediately fouled him, sending the junior guard back to the line for more clutch free throws. Once again, Buchanan split his free throws, giving Northwestern a chance to tie the game in the final moments. West dribbled the ball the full length of the floor, but Buchanan recovered from his miss and blocked his shot at the rim, securing a 77-75 victory for the Scarlet Knights in the game’s final moments.\n\nAfter leading by 12 points in the early going, Northwestern was unable to ride Martinelli’s 34 points to victory, suffering its fifth straight loss to open Big Ten play. Heartbreak for the ‘Cats on the road in New Jersey.",

The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle and starting safety Ji’Ayir Brown but still managed to take care of business on both sides of the ball. It wasn’t pretty, but the 49ers are headed to the Divisional Round.

Here's how the draft order looks after the start of the playoffs:\n\n13. Falcons (traded first-round pick to Rams)\n\n16. Colts (traded first-round pick to Jets)\n\n20. Packers (traded first-round pick to Cowboys)\n\n24. Jaguars (traded first-round pick to Browns)\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders earned the first overall pick by having with the easiest schedule of the four teams that finished tied with the worst record in the NFL, 3-14.\n\nDraft picks are awarded in order of lowest winning percentage, and the tiebreaker is opponents’ winning percentage, with the team that played the easiest schedule picking first. If two teams have the same record and same strength of schedule, division or conference tiebreakers are applied. If the divisional or conference tiebreakers are not applicable, or ties still exist between teams of different conferences, ties will be broken the following tie-breaking method:\n\nBest won-lost-tied percentage in common games (minimum of four)\n\nStrength of victory in all games\n\nBest combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed in all games\n\nBest net touchdowns in all games\n\nThe 18 non-playoff teams get the first 18 picks. The six wild card round playoff losers get picks 19-24, the four divisional round losers get picks 25-28, the conference championship game losers get picks 29 and 30, the Super Bowl loser gets pick 31 and the Super Bowl winner gets pick 32.\n\nThe 2026 NFL draft takes place April 23-25 in Pittsburgh. The first round will be on Thursday night, the second and third rounds will be on Friday night, and the fourth through seventh rounds will be on Saturday.\n\nIndiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is the betting favorite to go first overall.

    "description": "6th-seeded 49ers win at Carolina. So San Francisco at Seattle for a spot in the NFC championship game. Why likely Saturday.",
    "fullText": "The Seahawks now know whom they are going to play to begin their playoffs. It’s an old, despised rival. In a rematch from a recent showdown.\n\nSixth-seed San Francisco rallied from a deficit at halftime at Philadelphia Sunday to beat the third-seeded Eagles. The win over the defending Super Bowl champions makes the 49ers the lowest remaining seed in the NFC to win on wild-card weekend.\n\nThat means the 49ers (13-5) will play at top-seeded Seattle (14-3) in a showdown of NFC West rivals next weekend at Lumen Field in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs.\n\nOdds and precedence say that game is most likely going to be next Saturday, Jan. 17, either at 1:30 p.m. or 5 p.m.\n\nThe NFC’s top seed has played on the Saturday of the divisional round every playoffs since the end of the 2019 season. Including the AFC, at least one of the two conference seeds have played on that Saturday in round two every year since the 2016 season.\n\nThe league likes to reward the number-one seeds with the advantage of an extra day of rest and preparation should they win in divisional round to each of the conference championship games. Those are on the following Sunday, Jan. 25. The Rams will play the Bears in Chicago in the other NFC divisional game.\n\nSeattle split its two division games against San Francisco this season.\n\nIn week one in September, the 49ers led 17-13 late in the game when Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold lost a fumble near the San Francisco 10-yard line in the final seconds of the game to ensure the Niners’ seventh victory in eight games against the Seahawks.\n\nIn week 18 Jan. 3 in Santa Clara, California, coach Mike Macdonald’s Seahawks defense dominated Kyle Shanahan’s offense in the NFC West title game. Seattle held San Francisco to 127 yards in a 13-3 win. It was the 49ers’ fewest points in a game in nine years.\n\nThis is Seattle’s first time with a wild-card playoff bye and top seed since January 2015, at the end of its last Super Bowl season.\n\nAfter two practices this week and this weekend off, Seahawks veteran wide receiver Cooper Kupp said the Seahawks have a we-aren’t-satisfied attitude heading into the divisional round.\n\n“We’re still under construction. We’re still working towards something,” Kupp said. “The attitude and the effort for the last couple of days, the focus that was in this room out in the walk-throughs and out there on the practice field speaks about the guys that we have here.\n\n“Everyone is excited about this opportunity. We’re going to take these next few days and recover and come back ready to go.”",

    "description": "Here's a look at the offseason work ahead for the Philadelphia Eagles.",
    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has begun, and Yahoo Sports is previewing the coming months for all 32 teams, from free agency through the draft and more.\n\nAFC East: Bills | Dolphins | Patriots | Jets\nAFC North: Ravens | Bengals | Browns | Steelers \nAFC South: Texans | Colts | Jaguars | Titans \nAFC West: Broncos | Chiefs | Raiders | Chargers \nNFC East: Cowboys | Giants | Eagles | Commanders \nNFC North: Bears | Lions | Packers | Vikings \nNFC South: Falcons | Panthers | Saints | Buccaneers \nNFC West: Cardinals | Rams | 49ers | Seahawks\n\n2025 season record: 11-6 (u 11.5 wins), first in NFC East, lost to 49ers in wild-card round, 13th in DVOA\n\nThis was not the world-beating team so many expected to see after last year’s Super Bowl title. Last season. Philadelphia battled with some inconsistency in the offense but found a groove by the end of the season. The 2025 version never fully got it.\n\nHow the Eagles played in games was telling. In 2024, they were 24th in points per drive on their opening possession, but improved to fifth over the rest of the game. The 2025 Eagles were sixth in points per drive on their opening possession, but dropped to 25th on all following drives. The 2024 Eagles figured it out, while the 2025 version couldn’t adapt. Offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo might take the fall for that, failing to replicate the work Kellen Moore did previously.\n\nThe talent is still overwhelming. That was the case with a defense that was still second in EPA per play while developing multiple All-Pro-caliber players. But, also as the defense proved, this team needs to figure out how to make that talent work together instead of just relying on the talent to carry itself.\n\nThe Eagles have just over $14 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap. That ranks 16th. They’re fairly locked into this roster. Because of how the Eagles have structured their contracts, there’s not a lot of restructure potential — most contracts are pre-restuctured with small base salaries and option bonuses. If the Eagles re-sign Dallas Goedert early, they could create space by shrinking the $20.5 million figure that would hit the cap when his contract voids on Feb. 16.\n\nTE Dallas Goedert \nEdge Jaelan Phillips \nLB Nakobe Dean \nS Reed Blankenship\n\nGoedert led the team and was ninth in the league with a 27.8% target share in the red zone. His 10 red zone touchdowns were second only to Davante Adams. Jaelan Phillips was a defense-changer after the trade that brought him to Philadelphia. From Weeks 1-9, the Eagles were 14th in pressure rate. After Phillips was acquired, they ranked fifth. Dean has been excellent and was immediately put back into the starting lineup when he returned from injury, but the presence of Jihaad Campbell and the high rate of nickel defense will likely make Dean expendable in free agency.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are two of the best players at their positions, but the second outside cornerback spot was a hole all season. Adoree’ Jackson was one of the most targeted cornerbacks on a per-snap basis and the Eagles ranked 24th in DVOA against WR2s.\n\nEven if Goedert is re-signed, the Eagles should add a tight end to the mix. Grant Calcaterra was a negative as a blocker and did not make up for it enough as a receiver — though the Eagles were fifth in EPA per play from 12 personnel, which they ran at the 12th-highest rate in the league.\n\nDepth on the edge will need to be addressed. That was the reason for the Phillips trade and bringing Brandon Graham out of retirement. Neither of them is under contract for 2026.\n\n1st round \n2nd round \n3rd round \n3rd round (projected compensatory) \n4th round \n4th round (projected compensatory) \n5th round (ATL) \n5th round (projected compensatory)\n6th round\n\nThe Eagles have built their dominance through the trenches, and now they find Lane Johnson’s long-term replacement. Lomu moves well for his size, and has polished technique and can add even more weight and strength. He can learn behind Jeff Stoutland and the All-Pros they have along the line before taking over himself.\n\nThe Eagles went 10-7 against the spread in the 2025-26 regular season, but were only 8-7 ATS as a favorite. They were also a surprisingly poor 4-4 ATS at home. — Ben Fawkes",

With Brown and rookie offensive tackle Aierontae Ersery missing multiple games, Howard has filled in at both left and right tackle. He also played at right guard in Week 1 against the Los Angeles Rams after Ed Ingram was a late scratch.\n\nKickoff from Acrisure Stadium is scheduled for 7 p.m.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: Tytus Howard injury update: Will Texans OL play vs. Steelers?",

They beat the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday of Week 18 to clinch the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoff bracket.\n\nThe No. 1 seed comes with a first round bye, which will give Seattle time to rest and get some players back from the injury list.

It does not tell us much more about the Seahawks Divisional Round opponent other than to eliminate the Panthers from the list.\n\nThe NFL re-seeds its bracket after the Wild Card round. That means the Seahawks will face the worst remaining seed rather than knowing it will be one of two teams.

The last time they played in the Divisional Round was 2019, where they won a wild card game and then lost to the Packers.\n\nThis marks the fourth time the Seahawks have earned the No. 1 seed.

As far as the players that are coming in, you will become us and do things the way that we do things.\"\n\nSafeties Brandyn Hillman, Jordan Young, and TJ Metcalf, along with cornerback Jayden Sanders, ended up joining Elijah Dotson and Jaden Mangham, departing the program.

    "description": "The 49ers beat the Eagles in another exciting playoff matchup",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have struggled to find explosive plays this season. Brock Purdy found Demarcus Robinson, who beat Quinyon Mitchell of all people, for a 61-yard catch and run. Two plays later, Purdy lofted a pass into the hands of Christian McCaffrey for an 11-yard gain.\n\nThe drive ended how it began, with a reception by Robinson, who beat Mitchell once more for a touchdown to give the 49ers an early 7-0 lead.\n\nThe Eagles took advantage of Deommodore Lenoir’s overaggressiveness right away. Lenoir jumped inside, allowing Saquon Barkley to rush untouched down the sideline for 29 yards. Lenoir then gave up a first-down reception to A.J. Brown. On 3rd & 3, Barkley looked to be stopped initially, but managed to pick up a first down.\n\nThe Eagles had converted a league-high 70 percent of their red zone trips into touchdowns. Garret Wallow and Ji’Ayir Brown were unblocked on two separate plays, but couldn’t tackle Barkley. A jet sweep to Dallas Goedert brought the Eagles within one, but Jake Elliott’s missed extra point meant the 49ers still had a 7-6 lead.\n\nThe 49ers isolated Kittle on Mitchell on their second drive, but Mitchell won this battle. Purdy was late on a third-down throw to Robinson, after it appeared he was impacted by some pressure after Trent Williams got beaten, and the Niners went three-and-out. Thomas Morstead’s punt only went 35 yards.\n\nWorry set in, under the impression that the defense wouldn’t be able to get many stops. Eric Kendricks came up with one on first down. Garret Wallow had one on second down. But Lenoir was beaten once again on third down, giving the Eagles another first down. Lenoir got his wish to travel with the wide receivers. He followed A.J. Brown, but Brown won once again for eight yards.\n\nSam Okuayinonu made a stop on 3rd & 2. The 49ers have been excellent all season in short-yardage situations. But they were going against a team that uses all four downs. The Eagles were 0 for seven on their previous fourth-down attempts. Upton Stout undercut DeVonta Smith’s route, making Philly 0-for-8.\n\nThe 49ers had prime field position, but couldn’t muster anything. Jauan Jennings didn’t stand a chance against Cooper DeJean, and nobody could get open on a third-down scramble by Purdy, leading to a quick three-and-out. Jennings’ second down target was technically a drop.\n\nLetting the Eagles off the hook after a turnover in that spot was always going to come back to bite the Niners. It was just a matter of when.\n\nMorstead’s punt pinned the Eagles at the six-yard line. That did not matter, as the Eagles gained 7, 7, 9, and 5 yards to begin the drive. After a first down incompletion and a Ji’Ayir Brown tackle near the line of scrimmage, the 49ers forced a 3rd & 10. A false start made it 3rd-and-15.\n\nNo pressure allowed DeVonta Smith to gain 14 yards, and we knew what was next. Jalen Hurts tush-pushed his way for a first down—another backbreaker. Barkley gained 20 on a screen. Tank Bigsby ran into the red zone and eventually down to the 10-yard line.\n\nThe front-7 couldn’t do anything to stop the Eagles’ running game, which averaged nearly six yards per carry and had almost 100 yards midway through the second quarter. A Kendricks tackle for loss forced a 3rd & 5. On 4th & 2, Malik Mustapha was beaten in coverage for a touchdown. There was a flag picked up, and the Eagles took a 13-7 lead.\n\nJi’Ayir Brown limped off the field and was questionable to return with a hamstring injury.\n\nThe 49ers lost George Kittle to an apparent Achilles injury on the first play of their next drive. Jauan Jennings answered with a 45-yard reception. McCaffrey slipped on 3rd & 1, and Shanahan elected for points. Eddy Pineiro’s field goal was good, bringing the score to 13-10.\n\nThe 49ers’ defense needed to come up with a stop. Rookie Marques Sigle made a tackle on first down, then was able to sprint back and help Lenoir break up a deep pass, finally, on third and long. Renardo Green forced an incompletion against A.J. Brown to force a punt.\n\nAfter being sacked, Robinson beat Adoree Jackson on a comeback route for a first down. Not only did that allow the 49ers to continue to possess the ball and keep it away from the Eagles, but it also gave them an opportunity to kick a field goal.\n\nUnfortunately, Pinerio wouldn’t get that chance. Malik Turner and Kendrick Bourne couldn’t get lined up pre-snap, forcing the offense to burn its final timeout. Shanahan called a creative play before the half, but Purdy fumbled, and that ran the clock to 0.\n\nAt the half, Purdy had a passing success rate of 47 percent, compared to 50 percent from Hurts. However, Purdy had a higher EPA per dropback at .42 than Hurts at .22. The defense against a turnover was the difference in the first half, not to mention not scoring at the end of it.\n\nThe 49ers’ defense forced a three-and-out. But Skyy Moore did not do them any favors after fielding a punt at the five-yard line. The offense got a little help after Jauan Jennings drew a personal foul. Robinson beat Jackson once more for a 14-yard gain. He was the only reliable wideout and still continued to come through.\n\nBut Purdy’s next attempt would be costly. He was late when targeting Skyy Moore, who was being defended by Quinyon Mitchell. The pass was a floater, and Mitchell easily intercepted the pass, stalling a 49ers game-tying drive.\n\nA holding call put the Eagles behind the sticks. On 3rd & 19, the defense got off the field. That was the third three-and-out in a row the 49ers forced. Not allowing points off a turnover was huge in that spot by the defense.\n\nThe offense couldn’t muster anything on its next drive. McCaffrey ran for one yard, then a third-down attempt by McCaffrey was high, forcing a punt. Morstead’s 25-yard punt gave the Eagles the ball around midfield.\n\nCJ West kicked off the drive with a tackle for loss. Kendricks had another tackle for loss. Sigle made an impressive open-field tackle, but the Eagles continued to convert on third downs. Bryce Huff made the third tackle for loss on the drive. The 49ers forced a field goal attempt from 41 yards out. This time, Jake Elliott’s kick was good to make it 16-10.\n\nKyle Juszczyk was wide open to begin the next drive. He did more damage after the catch before finally being tackled after 27 yards. Heading into the 4th quarter, the 49ers were knocking on the door of the red zone.\n\nThe 49ers had the wind at their backs in the fourth quarter. Shanahan called a trick play where Jauan Jennings threw it to Christian McCaffrey. The play did not disappoint:\n\nThe call. The throw. The catch. Cinema. pic.twitter.com/Ib6dsjhUtp\n\n— Niners Nation (@NinersNation) January 12, 2026\n\nPer Next Gen Stats, that was the deepest touchdown reception by air yards of McCaffrey’s career.\n\nThe defense did its part on the ensuing drive by forcing a punt. Keion White won on third down. The offense still needed to find a way to add points.\n\nJuszczyk kicked things off with a first-down reception. But Purdy’s pass to Jake Tonges was late once more. The ball floated, and Mitchell had another interception. It was an inopportune time for a bad decision.\n\nThe first penalty of the game for the 49ers didn’t come at a good time, either. Marques Sigle was flagged for a late hit while Hurts was sliding, putting the ball into field goal range. Elliott’s 33-yard attempt split the uprights to give the Eagles a 19-17 lead.\n\nRobinson went over 100 yards with his next reception to put the 49ers in Eagles territory. It was a gain of 16 yards. Shanahan called one of his timely screens, and McCaffrey picked up another chunk play. Tonges drew a holding penalty, negating a Purdy sack to give the offense a first down.\n\nJuszczyk made a fantastic catch on a throw that was behind him. Jennings had an opportunity to catch a touchdown on 2nd & goal, but couldn’t haul in the pass. On 3rd & goal, Purdy bought time before finding McCaffrey in the end zone to give the Niners a 23-19 lead after Pineiro missed the point after attempt.\n\nOn 3rd & 5, Brown had a couple of steps on Lenoir, but he could not hold onto the ball. The Eagles went for it on 4th & 5 and converted after Goedert beat Mustapha. DeVonta Smith had a pair of first-down receptions to put the Eagles on the brink of the red zone. But Smith dropped a 3rd & 11, which meant the game would come down to a 4th & 11.\n\nEric Kendricks got into the throwing lane to nearly intercept the pass. It was a remarkable game with plenty of ebbs and flows, but the 49ers prevailed.\n\nThe 49ers ended up outgaining the Eagles, who only went 5-for-16 on third downs. Props to Robert Saleh and the defense for holding the Eagles to 19 points and turning them over twice. Brock Purdy turned it over twice but drove the offense for the game-winning drive.",

    "fullText": "The Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine (sometimes called the Machine Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine or MENACE) was a mechanical computer made from 304 matchboxes designed and built by artificial intelligence researcher Donald Michie and his colleague Roger Chambers, in 1961. It was designed to play human opponents in games of noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe) by returning a move for any given state of play and to refine its strategy through reinforcement learning. This was one of the first types of artificial intelligence.\n\nMichie and Chambers did not have immediate access to a computer; they worked around this by building the engine out of matchboxes.[1] The matchboxes they used each represented a single possible layout of a noughts and crosses grid. When the computer first played, it would randomly choose moves based on the current layout. As it played more games, through a reinforcement loop, it disqualified strategies that led to losing games, and supplemented strategies that led to winning games. Michie held a tournament against MENACE in 1961, wherein he experimented with different openings.\n\nFollowing MENACE's maiden tournament against Michie, it demonstrated successful artificial intelligence in its strategy. Michie's essays on MENACE's weight initialisation and the BOXES algorithm used by MENACE became popular in the field of computer science research. Michie was honoured for his contribution to machine learning research, and was twice commissioned to program a MENACE simulation on an actual computer.\n\nDonald Michie (1923–2007) had been on the team decrypting the German Tunny Code during World War II.[2] Fifteen years later, he wanted to further display his mathematical and computational prowess with an early convolutional neural network. Since computer equipment was not obtainable for such uses,[3] and Michie did not have a computer readily available,[3] he decided to display and demonstrate artificial intelligence in a more esoteric format and constructed a functional mechanical computer out of matchboxes and beads.[4][5]\n\nMENACE was constructed as the result of a bet with a computer science colleague who postulated that such a machine was impossible.[6] Michie undertook the task of collecting and defining each matchbox as a \"fun project\", later turned into a demonstration tool.[1] Michie completed his essay on MENACE in 1963,[5] \"Experiments on the mechanization of game-learning\", as well as his essay on the BOXES Algorithm, written with R. A. Chambers[1] and had built up an AI research unit in Hope Park Square, Edinburgh, Scotland.[7]\n\nMENACE learned by playing successive matches of noughts and crosses. Each time, it would eliminate a losing strategy by the human player confiscating the beads that corresponded to each move.[5] It reinforced winning strategies by making the moves more likely, by supplying extra beads.[8] This was one of the earliest versions of the Reinforcement Loop, the schematic algorithm of looping the algorithm, dropping unsuccessful strategies until only the winning ones remain.[5] This model starts as completely random, and gradually learns.[9]\n\nMENACE was made from 304 matchboxes glued together in an arrangement similar to a chest of drawers.[10] Each box had a code number, which was keyed into a chart. This chart had drawings of tic-tac-toe game grids with various configurations of X, O, and empty squares,[5] corresponding to all possible permutations a game could go through as it progressed.[11] After removing duplicate arrangements (ones that were simply rotations or mirror images of other configurations), MENACE used 304 permutations in its chart and thus that many matchboxes.[12]\n\nEach individual matchbox tray contained a collection of coloured beads.[13] Each colour represented a move on a square on the game grid, and so matchboxes with arrangements where positions on the grid were already taken would not have beads for that position. Additionally, at the front of the tray were two extra pieces of card in a \"V\" shape,[10] the point of the \"V\" pointing at the front of the matchbox.[11] Michie and his artificial intelligence team called MENACE's algorithm \"Boxes\",[7] after the apparatus used for the machine. The first stage \"Boxes\" operated in five phases, each setting a definition and a precedent for the rules of the algorithm in relation to the game.[14]\n\nMENACE played first, as O, since all matchboxes represented permutations only relevant to the \"X\" player.[12][17] To retrieve MENACE's choice of move, the opponent or operator located the matchbox that matched the current game state, or a rotation or mirror image of it. For example, at the start of a game, this would be the matchbox for an empty grid. The tray would be removed and lightly shaken so as to move the beads around.[5] Then, the bead that had rolled into the point of the \"V\" shape at the front of the tray was the move MENACE had chosen to make.[5] Its colour was then used as the position to play on, and, after accounting for any rotations or flips needed based on the chosen matchbox configuration's relation to the current grid, the O would be placed on that square. Then the player performed their move, the new state was located, a new move selected, and so on, until the game was finished.[12]\n\nWhen the game had finished, the human player observed the game's outcome. As a game was played, each matchbox that was used for MENACE's turn had its tray returned to it ajar, and the bead used kept aside, so that MENACE's choice of moves and the game states they belonged to were recorded. Michie described his reinforcement system with \"reward\" and \"punishment\". Once the game was finished, if MENACE had won, it would then receive a \"reward\" for its victory. The removed beads showed the sequence of the winning moves.[17] These were returned to their respective trays, easily identifiable since they were slightly open, as well as three bonus beads of the same colour.[11] In this way, in future games MENACE would become more likely to repeat those winning moves, reinforcing winning strategies. If it lost, the removed beads were not returned, \"punishing\" MENACE, and meaning that in future it would be less likely, and eventually incapable if that colour of bead became absent, to repeat the moves that cause a loss.[4][8] If the game was a draw, one additional bead was added to each box.[11]\n\nNoughts and crosses has a well-known optimal strategy.[18] A player must place their symbol in a way that blocks the other player from achieving any rows while simultaneously making a row themself. However, if both players use this strategy, the game always ends in a draw.[18] If the human player is familiar with the optimal strategy, and MENACE can quickly learn it, then the games will eventually only end in draws. The likelihood of the computer winning increases quickly when the computer plays against a random-playing opponent.[4]\n\nWhen playing against a player using optimal strategy, the odds of a draw grow to 100%. In Donald Michie's official tournament against MENACE in 1961[5] he used optimal strategy, and he and the computer began to draw consistently after twenty games. Michie's tournament[19] had the following milestones: Michie began by consistently opening with \"Variant 0\", the middle square. At 15 games, MENACE abandoned all non-corner openings. At just over 20, Michie switched to consistently using \"Variant 1\", the bottom-right square. At 60, he returned to Variant 0. As he neared 80 games, he moved to \"Variant 2\", the top-middle. At 110, he switched to \"Variant 3\", the top right. At 135, he switched to \"Variant 4\", middle-right. At 190, he returned to Variant 1, and at 210, he returned to Variant 0.\n\nThe trend in changes of beads in the \"2\" boxes runs:[19]\n\nDepending on the strategy employed by the human player, MENACE produces a different trend on scatter graphs of wins.[5] Using a random turn from the human player results in an almost-perfect positive trend. Playing the optimal strategy returns a slightly slower increase.[4] The reinforcement does not create a perfect standard of wins; the algorithm will draw random uncertain conclusions each time. After the j-th round, the correlation of near-perfect play runs:\n\n1\n −\n D\n\n D\n −\n\n D\n\n (\n j\n +\n 2\n )\n\n ∑\n\n i\n =\n 0\n\n j\n\n D\n\n (\n j\n i\n +\n 1\n )\n\n V\n\n i\n\n {\\displaystyle {1-D \\over D-D^{(j+2)}}\\sum _{i=0}^{j}D^{(ji+1)}V_{i}}\n\nWhere Vi is the outcome (+1 is win, 0 is draw and -1 is loss) and D is the decay factor (average of past values of wins and losses). Below, Mn is the multiplier for the n-th round of the game.[5]\n\nDonald Michie's MENACE proved that a computer could learn from failure and success to become good at a task.[17] It used what would become core principles within the field of machine learning before they had been properly theorised. For example, the combination of how MENACE starts with equal numbers of types of beads in each matchbox, and how these are then selected at random, creates a learning behaviour similar to weight initialisation in modern artificial neural networks.[20] In 1968, Donald Michie and R.A Chambers made another BOXES-based algorithm called GLEE (Game Learning Expectimaxing Engine) which had to learn how to balance a pole on a cart.[21]\n\nAfter the resounding reception of MENACE, Michie was invited to the US Office of Naval Research, where he was commissioned to build a BOXES-running program for an IBM Computer for use at Stanford University.[22] Michie created a simulation program of MENACE on a Pegasus 2 computer with the aid of D. Martin.[5] There have been multiple recreations of MENACE in more recent years, both in its original physical form and as a computer program.[12] Its algorithm was later converged into Christopher Watkin's Q-Learning algorithm.[23] Although not as a functional computer, in examples of demonstration, MENACE has been used as a teaching aid for various neural network classes,[24][25][26] including a public demonstration from University College London researcher Matthew Scroggs.[27][28] A copy of MENACE built by Scroggs was featured in the 2019 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures,[29][30] and in a 2023 episode of QI XL.[31]\n\nMENACE is referenced in Fred Saberhagen's 1963 short story Without A Thought, and Thomas J Ryan's 1977 novel The Adolescence of P-1.[32] In her 2023 book The Future, author Naomi Alderman includes a fictional lecture with a detailed overview of MENACE.",

    "description": "A technical breakdown of the timing circuit in the Ursa Major StarGate 323 digital reverb, explaining how a counter and PROM generate 16 coordinated control signals.",
    "fullText": "The Ursa Major StarGate 323 is a digital reverb from 1982 that uses a timing circuit to coordinate all of its internal operations. This post breaks down how that circuit works, from the crystal oscillator to the final control signals.\n\nTo understand how this circuit works, I built a simulation in Logisim Evolution. The animation below shows the circuit running—watch the counter increment while the control signals flip on and off.\n\nThe timing circuit generates 16 control signals that orchestrate everything else in the system: memory access, address sequencing, and more. These signals follow a precise 256-step pattern that repeats continuously. One signal in particular—TCB1—is key to understanding how the StarGate creates its reverb, as it drives the delay system that we'll explore at the end of this post.\n\nRather than using logic gates to derive these signals, the designers took a clever approach: they pre-computed the entire sequence and stored it in PROMs. The circuit simply counts from 0 to 255 and uses each count value to look up the corresponding control byte.\n\nThe timing circuit follows a straightforward pipeline:\n\nEach clock tick advances the counter, which changes the PROM address, which outputs a new control byte, which updates the control signals. The entire cycle takes 256 clock ticks, then repeats.\n\nThe clock is slowed down here—in the actual hardware it runs at 8.192 MHz. The counter cycles through 256 PROM addresses, each outputting 8 control signals. TCB1 is one of these signals, programmed to pulse approximately 15 times per cycle.\n\nTwo 74LS163 4-bit counters are chained together to form an 8-bit counter. U53 handles the low nibble (bits 0-3) and U52 handles the high nibble (bits 4-7).\n\nThe chain works through the carry output: U53 counts 0 through 15, and when it rolls over from 15 to 0, its carry output (C15) pulses high. This carry signal connects to U52's enable inputs (ENP and ENT), causing U52 to increment only when U53 overflows.\n\nThe result is an 8-bit count from 0 to 255. The eight output lines (TC0-TC7) connect directly to the address inputs of both timing PROMs.\n\nTwo 28L22 PROMs (256 x 8-bit) hold the pre-programmed control sequences. Each PROM contains 256 bytes, and each bit of each byte controls one signal. Together they produce 16 control signals—including TCB1—that orchestrate the entire system.\n\nAnalyzing the PROM data reveals how often each signal transitions during one 256-step cycle. The signal that matters most for understanding the reverb is TCB1. It pulses about 15 times per cycle, and each pulse advances the slot counter that addresses the delay PROM. This is the clock that drives the delay tap sequencing—the core of how the StarGate reads back delayed audio at specific tap positions.\n\nThe PROM approach lets the designers encode precise timing relationships that would require complex logic gates to generate otherwise. With 512 bytes total, they could specify exactly what should happen at every step without debugging state machines.\n\nThis matters for TCB1 especially. The slot counter it drives needs to advance at precisely the right moments. That relationship is baked directly into the bit patterns—the designers simply programmed the exact sequence they needed.\n\nTCB1 pulses approximately 15 times per 256-step cycle. Each pulse advances the DAC slot address counter (U72 and U73 in the schematic), which in turn addresses the delay PROM. The delay PROM contains the tap positions—the specific memory addresses where the system reads back delayed audio samples.\n\nThis is the heart of how the StarGate creates reverb: the timing circuit generates TCB1 pulses, TCB1 advances the slot counter, the slot counter addresses the delay PROM, and the delay PROM tells the system where to read from the audio memory. The pattern of tap positions stored in the delay PROM defines the reverb character.\n\nIn the next post, I'll trace this signal path further and explore how the delay system uses these tap positions to create the StarGate's signature sound.",

    "title": "AeroTag – Tag-based workspace management for AeroSpace (macOS)",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "As a long-time AwesomeWM user who has loved using River in recent years, working on macOS was painful for me.\n\nThe other day, my company issued me a new Mac, so I asked an LLM if I could build an environment like Awesome or River on a Mac. The answer was: \"You can do it by combining AeroSpace, AeroRaise, and JankyBorders!\"\n\nI've tried various tiling window managers for macOS, but never AeroSpace. My first impression was good. It's independent of the system's desktop management and lacks unnecessary window animations.\n\nHowever, the fact that its workspace management is completely different from Awesome or River was quite difficult for me. But since I was satisfied with the other aspects, I started thinking that if I could just solve this one issue, I might be able to live comfortably on a Mac.\n\nSince AeroSpace allows retrieving the current state and manipulating it via the command line, I thought I could extend the workspace management with an external tool.[1]\nAnd this is what I built:\n\ntypester/aerotag: Tag-based workspace management for AeroSpace.\n\nThe specific usage is detailed in the README, but basically, instead of writing workspace operations like this:\n\nYou simply use the aerotag command like this:\n\nI aligned the basic commands with Awesome's commands, and for advanced users, I also provided a River-like bitmask API. Using this, users can create commands not originally provided, such as \"remove the focused window from the focused tag\".\n\nI also prepared a command to stream workspace status in real-time. With this, you can render AeroTag's status on a menu bar like SketchyBar. (Since I don't use SketchyBar myself, support for it is provided on a best-effort basis.)\n\nVery few WMs adopt this method—as far as I know, only dwm, awesome, and river—so few readers are likely familiar with it.\n\nTag-based workspaces differ from normal workspaces in that you can display multiple workspaces at once. Also, a window can belong to multiple workspaces.\nFrom a programmer's perspective, both the displayed workspaces and the workspaces a window belongs to are defined by bitmasks.\n\nLet me explain why this is useful using my daily WM usage as an example.\n\nMy most basic workspace (tag) configuration looks like this:\n\nI use 10 tags like this, basically placing one application per tag.\nI also usually place dev tools to the left, communication tools on the far right, and other software to the right.\n\nNow, a common situation is wanting to reference documents or tickets in Firefox while writing code in Emacs, or wanting to do something else while watching logs in a terminal. There is a demand to combine applications across workspaces. This is very easy with a WM that has tag-based workspace management.\n\nIf you are using Emacs (Tag 3 is displayed) and want to reference Firefox, you just need to toggle the display of Tag 2 in addition to Tag 3. Just like that, Tag 2 and Tag 3 are displayed simultaneously, showing the two apps side-by-side (the image below shows Terminal and Emacs, so Tag 1 and Tag 3 are displayed).\n\nAnother common situation is when I have two Firefox windows on Tag 2, but I want to use only one of them with Emacs. In this case, if I use the previous method (displaying Tag 2 and Tag 3 together), both Firefox windows would appear, resulting in a total of 3 windows. That is not ideal, so in this case, I make the Firefox window I want to share belong to Tag 3 as well. This is similar to traditional workspace management, but the difference is that Firefox remains on Tag 2, so it is still available when I open Tag 2.\n\nIn use cases like this, tag-based workspace management is extremely flexible. Once you get used to this mechanism, it becomes painful to be without it, and you will fall into the same situation I am in.\n\nHowever, currently we have Awesome for X Window System, River for Wayland, and now the same mechanism is available on macOS, so the options are aligning (though as mentioned later, Aerotag still has some issues).\n\nI started with Awesome, so I continue to use the keybindings I used in Awesome for both River and AeroTag. This means that once you learn how to use one tag-based WM, transitioning to another is very easy.\n\nOf course, since I am forcing this workspace management on top of the system, issues remain.\n\nWhen combining various apps by toggling tags, the layout generally gets reset.\nIn my case, I mostly use 2 screens (panes), or at most 3 screens[2], so it is not a problem. However, I think it is not practically usable for people who open a massive amount of windows.\n\nI feel the operations via AeroTag are reasonably responsive and natural. However, for example, when activating another app using the open command from the terminal, or switching apps from the Dock, the underlying AeroSpace workspace appears briefly before moving to the AeroTag-managed workspace. As a result, the screen flickers for a moment.\nThis is unavoidable due to the current specifications, so we just have to give up on it for now.\n\nDespite various issues and quirks, I am personally very satisfied with this environment. Restricted to my specific use case, I can now have almost the same experience on macOS as developing on Linux, which makes me incredibly happy. I am even starting to think I could make the Mac my main environment.\n\nIf you are interested, please give it a try. I would be happy to hear your feedback.",

    "description": "The investigation, which centers on renovations of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, signals an escalation in the long-running clash between President Trump and the chair.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia has opened a criminal investigation into Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, over the central bank’s renovation of its Washington headquarters and whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress about the scope of the project, according to officials briefed on the situation.\n\nThe inquiry, which includes an analysis of Mr. Powell’s public statements and an examination of spending records, was approved in November by Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of President Trump who was appointed to run the office last year, the officials said.\n\nThe investigation escalates Mr. Trump’s long-running feud with Mr. Powell, whom the president has continually attacked for resisting his demands to slash interest rates significantly. The president has threatened to fire the Fed chair — even though he nominated Mr. Powell for the position in 2017 — and raised the prospect of a lawsuit against him related to the $2.5 billion renovation, citing “incompetence.”\n\nMr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview last week that he had decided on who he wants to replace Mr. Powell as Fed chair. He is expected to soon announce his decision. Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, is a front-runner for the top job. While Mr. Powell’s term as chair ends in May, his term as a governor runs through January 2028. Mr. Powell has not disclosed whether he plans to stay on at the central bank beyond this year.\n\nIn a rare video message released by the Fed on Sunday, Mr. Powell described the investigation as “unprecedented” and questioned the motivation for the move, even as he affirmed that he carried out his duties as chair “without political fear or favor.”\n\n“This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,” he said. “It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts.”\n\nHe warned that the investigation signaled a broader battle over the Fed’s independence. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”\n\nA spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi did not comment on the investigation but said Ms. Bondi had “instructed her U.S. attorneys to prioritize investing any abuses of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s investigation into Mr. Powell underscores Mr. Trump’s larger clash with the Fed. Other broadsides have included an effort to oust Lisa D. Cook, a governor at the central bank whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of mortgage fraud. Presidents are able to remove officials at the Fed only for “cause,” which has typically meant malfeasance or a dereliction of duty. The Supreme Court will hear arguments for Ms. Cook’s case on Jan. 21.\n\nCongress granted the Fed the authority to set interest rates free of meddling from presidents, whose political fortunes are often tethered to how the economy is faring. Rather, lawmakers stipulated that the central bank should pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market.\n\nMr. Powell said on Sunday that the Justice Department had served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas. Prosecutors in Ms. Pirro’s office have contacted Mr. Powell’s staff multiple times to request documents about the renovation project, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation who discussed an open inquiry on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStarting an investigation is one thing, presenting sufficient evidence to secure an indictment from a federal grand jury — or making it stick — is another.\n\nIndictments against two of Mr. Trump’s top targets, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, were thrown out in November by a federal judge. An investigation into Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, has yet to yield enough evidence to present to a grand jury.\n\nThe renovations at the center of the investigation into Mr. Powell broke ground in 2022 and are set to be completed in 2027. They are estimated to be about $700 million over budget. The project involves expanding and modernizing the Marriner S. Eccles Building and another building on Constitution Avenue, which date to the 1930s.\n\nThe Fed has said that neither of those buildings has been “comprehensively renovated” since their construction nearly 100 years ago, suggesting they were in need of a significant overhaul. Part of the project includes removing asbestos and lead contamination as well as making the facilities compliant with laws related to accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nA 2021 version of the Fed’s proposal described private elevators and dining rooms for top policymakers, water fountains and new marble features, in addition to a rooftop terrace for staff. Pressed at a congressional hearing in June, Mr. Powell denied that many of those features were part of the latest proposal.\n\n“There’s no V.I.P. dining room; there’s no new marble,” he said. “We took down the old marble, we’re putting it back up. We’ll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke. But there’s no special elevators. There’s just old elevators that have been there.”\n\nMr. Powell added that the project’s plans had “continued to evolve” and that some features that had been initially incorporated were scrapped.\n\nAfter Mr. Powell’s testimony, the Fed published a “Frequently Asked Questions” post on its website that reaffirmed Mr. Powell’s answers to lawmakers. The central bank continued to share additional details, including a virtual tour as well as photographs and annotations to the 2021 proposal that prompted the criticism.\n\nIn explaining the cost overruns, the central bank cited expenses tied to materials, equipment and labor as well as unforeseen circumstances, such as more asbestos than anticipated and soil contamination.",

    "fullText": "Jan 11 (Reuters) - Israel is on high alert for the possibility of any U.S. intervention in Iran as ​authorities there confront the biggest anti-government protests in ‌years, according to three Israeli sources with knowledge of the matter.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ‌has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days and warned Iran’s rulers against using force against demonstrators. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. stands “ready to help”.\n\nThe sources, who were present for ⁠Israeli security consultations over ‌the weekend, did not elaborate on what Israel’s high-alert footing meant in practice. Israel and Iran ‍fought a 12-day war in June, in which the U.S. joined Israel in launching airstrikes.\n\nIn a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime ​Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio ‌discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source who was present for the conversation. A U.S. official confirmed the two men spoke but did not say what topics they discussed.\n\nIsrael has not signalled a desire ⁠to intervene in Iran as protests ​grip the country, with tensions between ​the two arch-foes high over Israeli concerns about Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\n\nIn an interview with ‍the Economist published ⁠on Friday, Netanyahu said there would be horrible consequences for Iran if it were to attack Israel.

    "title": "Elon Musk asked people to upload their medical data to X so his AI company could learn to interpret MRIs and CT scans",
    "description": "Health care experts are worried about Grok’s potential to breach patient privacy.",
    "fullText": "In Elon Musk’s world, AI is the new MD. The X owner is encouraging users to upload their medical test results—such as CT and bone scans—to the platform so that Grok, X’s artificial intelligence chatbot, can learn how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nHe’s previously said this information will be used to train X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk reposted a video on X of himself talking about uploading medical data to Grok, saying: “Try it!”\n\n“You can upload your X-rays or MRI images to Grok and it will give you a medical diagnosis,” Musk said in the video, which was uploaded in June. “I have seen cases where it’s actually better than what doctors tell you.\n\nIn 2024, Musk said medical images uploaded to Grok would be used to train the bot.\n\n“This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good,” Musk wrote on X. “Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work.”\n\nMusk also claimed in his response Grok saved a man in Norway by diagnosing a problem his doctors failed to notice. The X owner was willing to upload his own medical information to his bot.\n\n“I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,” Musk said in an episode of the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast released on Tuesday. “None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.”\n\nMusk did not disclose in the podcast why he received an MRI. XAI, which owns X, told Fortune in a statement: “Legacy Media Lies.”\n\nGrok is facing some competition in the AI health space. This week OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, an experience within the bot feature that allows users to securely connect medical records and wellness apps like MyFitnessPal and Apple Health. The company said it would not train the models using personal medical information.\n\nAI chatbots have become a ubiquitous source of medical information for people. OpenAI reported this week 40 million people seek health information from the model, 55% of which used to bot to look up or better understand symptoms.\n\nSo far, Grok’s ability to detect medical abnormalities have been mixed. The AI successfully analyzed blood test results and identified breast cancer, some users claimed. But it also grossly misinterpreted other pieces of information, according to physicians who responded to some of Musk’s about Grok’s ability to interpret medical information. In one instance, Grok mistook a “textbook case” of tuberculosis for a herniated disk or spinal stenosis. In another, the bot mistook a mammogram of a benign breast cyst for an image of testicles.\n\nA May 2025 study found that while all AI models have limitations in processing and predicting medical outcomes, Grok was the most effectively compared to Google’s Gemini and ChatGPT-4o when determining the presence of pathologies in 35,711 slices of brain MRI.\n\n“We know they have the technical capability,” Dr. Laura Heacock, associate professor at the New York University Langone Health Department of Radiology, wrote on X. “Whether or not they want to put in the time, data and [graphics processing units] to include medical imaging is up to them. For now, non-generative AI methods continue to outperform in medical imaging.”\n\nMusk’s lofty goal of training his AI to make medical diagnoses is also a risky one, experts said. While AI has increasingly been used as a means to make complicated science more accessible and create assistive technologies, teaching Grok to use data from a social media platform presents concerns about both Grok’s accuracy and user privacy.\n\nRyan Tarzy, CEO of health technology firm Avandra Imaging, said in an interview with Fast Company asking users to directly input data, rather than source it from secure databases with de-identified patient data, is Musk’s way of trying to accelerate Grok’s development. Also, the information comes from a limited sample of whoever is willing to upload their images and tests—meaning the AI is not gathering data from sources representative of the broader and more diverse medical landscape.\n\nMedical information shared on social media isn’t bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the federal law that protects patients’ private information from being shared without their consent. That means there’s less control over where the information goes after a user chooses to share it.\n\n“This approach has myriad risks, including the accidental sharing of patient identities,” Tarzy said. “Personal health information is ‘burned in’ too many images, such as CT scans, and would inevitably be released in this plan.”\n\nThe privacy dangers Grok may present aren’t fully known because X may have privacy protections not known by the public, according to Matthew McCoy, assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He said users share medical information at their own risk.\n\n“As an individual user, would I feel comfortable contributing health data?” he previously told the New York Times. “Absolutely not.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on Nov. 20, 2024.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Health in a push to become a hub for personal health data\n\nOpenAI suggests ChatGPT play doctor as millions of Americans face spiking insurance costs: ‘In the U.S., ChatGPT has become an important ally’\n\nAs Utah gives the AI power to prescribe some drugs, physicians warn of patient risks\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "This One Morning Mistake Makes You Crave Sugar All Day, Registered Dietitians Say",
    "description": "Here's why it happens—and how to avoid it.",
    "fullText": "If one of your 2026 goals is to eat healthier, you’re probably doing your best to keep your sugar intake to a minimum. While there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a sweet treat every now and then, having a diet high in sugar is linked to some pretty detrimental health issues.\n\nExcess sugar doesn’t just affect your waistline—it can influence your energy levels, mood, hormones and even how well you sleep at night. Over time, frequent blood sugar spikes and crashes can leave you feeling drained, foggy and irritable, making it harder to stick with healthy habits long-term.\n\nA diet high in sugar is also bad for your gut (and gut health is important for, well, everything), can lead to obesity, increase your risk of dementia and is detrimental to heart health. But even when you make a conscious effort to minimize your sugar intake, it can feel like your body is rebelling against you, making you crave sugar all day long.\n\nThis is a frustrating cycle that might make you think you don't have any willpower, when really, there are other factors at play. Things like blood sugar imbalance, inadequate protein or fiber intake, chronic stress and poor sleep can all amplify sugar cravings—even if you’re eating an overall healthy diet.\n\nAs registered dietitians explain here, there are several causes for sugar cravings, including one super common morning habit. Here's what to know.\n\n🩺\nAccording to registered dietitians, what you eat for breakfast can impact the type or cravings you have—or don’t have—the rest of the day. If your breakfast doesn’t have adequate protein (or you skip breakfast completely), it can lead to sugar cravings.\n\n“Including protein at breakfast slows digestion, supports steady energy and helps you feel satisfied for longer. It also signals to your body early in the day that it’s getting what it needs, which can reduce that mid-morning or afternoon pull toward sweets,” says Melissa Karp, RD, a registered dietitian and the founder of MPM Nutrition.\n\nKarp explains that when we eat protein, digestion slows, which helps prevent the blood sugar spikes and crashes that often drive cravings for quick energy, like sweets. “Protein also activates satiety hormones, helping your brain register fullness so you’re less likely to keep reaching for food in search of satisfaction,” she says.\n\nIn terms of how much protein you should aim to get at breakfast, Ashley Koff, RD, a registered dietitian, author of Your Best Shot and founder of The Better Nutrition Program, recommends getting between 15 and 40 grams, depending on your age, sex and how active you are. Some breakfast ideas Koff says to consider are eggs with half a sweet potato or a high-protein smoothie.\n\nKarp is also a fan of eggs or a smoothie for breakfast as a way to prevent sugar cravings later. “Eggs are a simple, powerful breakfast protein, with about 6 to 7 grams per egg,” she says, adding that she recommends pairing them with a sprouted-grain English muffin for an extra 8 grams of protein. “Adding avocado provides heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and soluble fiber, helping round out the meal and increase staying power.\"\n\nWhen making a smoothie, Karp says protein powder, fruit, spinach, chia seeds and nut butter are all nutrient-rich ingredients to consider.\n\nWhile getting adequate protein at breakfast can help prevent sugar cravings later in the day, there are other reasons why you may be craving sugar. Both dietitians say that not getting enough sleep the night before can lead to sugar cravings the next day.\n\n“When we don’t get enough sleep, our bodies are running on empty and searching for energy. The easiest way for our bodies to get a quick source of energy is sugar. On top of that, lack of sleep disrupts key appetite hormones, increasing hunger-driving ghrelin and decreasing leptin, which signals fullness, making high-carb and sugary foods especially appealing,” Karp explains.\n\nShe adds that not getting enough sleep also impacts blood sugar, which can then lead to sugar cravings, explaining, “Research shows that insulin sensitivity drops after poor sleep, meaning our bodies don’t use glucose as efficiently. That can lead to bigger blood sugar swings, which further fuel cravings for quick fixes, like sweets. In short, it’s not a lack of willpower, it’s your physiology responding to being overtired.\"\n\nIf you use artificial sweeteners, which are often found in foods branded as “diet” or “sugar-free,” Koff says this is something else that can lead to sugar cravings later. This is because artificial sweeteners confuse the brain’s hunger signals; it thinks it’s getting fuel in the form of sugar, but it’s not. This can lead to an increased appetite for sweet foods.\n\nBoth dietitians say that there are other causes for sugar cravings, including seeing sweet foods that look yummy, hormonal changes, feeling stressed, letting yourself get too hungry and having unbalanced meals. So, if you are making a conscious effort to get adequate protein at breakfast and you’re still craving sugar all day, it can be helpful to consider these other potential causes.\n\nMelissa Karp, RD, registered dietitian and the founder of MPM Nutrition\n\nAshley Koff, RD, registered dietitian, author of Your Best Shot and founder of The Better Nutrition Program\n\nZhang, Y., Walker, R.W., Kaplan, R.C., et al.

    "fullText": "The awards show ballot was once an innocent watch-party game.\n\nNow, millions of dollars are at stake.\n\nFans planning to watch the 83rd Golden Globe Awards are plowing money into prediction markets, hoping for a windfall if they correctly choose a winner.\n\nMillions have so far been bet on Golden Globe winners on Polymarket, one of the leading prediction market platforms. This year, Polymarket partnered with the Golden Globes, which airs on CBS and Paramount+ on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n\"The collaboration will bring real-time, market-driven insights across the Golden Globes live events and a broad digital and editorial ecosystem touching fans' greatest passion points across entertainment, fashion and pop culture,\" a joint press release said.\n\nPrediction markets, such as Polymarket and Kalshi, allow users to buy and sell shares on the outcomes of future events, including sports games or presidential elections, potentially resulting in a payday. Polymarket also provides real-time updates, meaning the data can provide insights into how consumers and investors think.\n\nThe relatively new markets are not strictly regulated, leaving room for those with insider knowledge to game the system. A last-minute bet on Polymarket last week that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro would be ousted netted strong returns after the US captured Maduro in a surprise raid hours later. A new bill proposed last week in response would prohibit government officials from insider trading on prediction markets.\n\nFor the Globes, fans have already bet nearly $2.5 million in contracts across 30 awards show categories on Polymarket, including Best Director and Best Motion Picture, as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nSo, who do betters think will win?\n\nOn Polymarket, betters think Paul Thomas Anderson, whose film \"One Battle After Another\" also snagged Golden Globe noms, has a 94% chance of winning Best Director. Ryan Coogler, director of \"Sinners,\" is behind Anderson at 3%.\n\nBetters gave Wagner Moura, who starred in \"The Secret Agent,\" a 73% chance of winning Best Actor in a motion picture drama. Michael B. Jordan of \"Sinners\" had a 24% chance.\n\nBest Actor — Musical or Comedy winner\n\nTimothee Chalamet, star of \"Marty Supreme,\" led with a 70% chance to win Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy motion picture on Sunday afternoon. Leonardo DiCaprio followed Chalamet at 17% for his work in \"One Battle After Another.\"\n\n\"Hamnet\" star Jessie Buckley had a 96% of winning Best Actress in a drama motion picture. Behind Buckley, betters gave Renate Reinsve of \"Sentimental Value\" a 3% chance of winning.\n\nBest Actress — Musical or Comedy winner\n\nPolymarket betters think Rose Byrne has a 76% chance of winning a Golden Globe Award for her role in the film, \"If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.\" Emma Stone, star of \"Bugonia,\" came in second at 12%.\n\nBest Motion Picture — Animated winner\n\nOn Polymarket, users gave Netflix's \"KPop Demon Hunters\" a 92% chance of winning the top animation prize. \"Acro,\" written and directed by Ugo Bienvenu, followed at a 5% chance.\n\nBest Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy winner\n\nBetters on Polymarket threw their money behind \"One Battle After Another\" to win this category at 97%, beating \"Marty Supreme,\" which had a 2% chance.\n\nBest Motion Picture — Drama winner\n\n\"Sinners\" had the highest chance to win Best Motion Picture in the drama category on Polymarket at 55%. \"Hamnet\" came behind that at a 31% chance.",

    "description": "I worried my toddler might wander out of the house after moving to a bed, so I got a home security system to help me sleep at night.",
    "fullText": "When I switched my then-2-year-old daughter from a crib to a bed, my biggest concern was resistance.\n\nI wanted to help her sleep soundly in her new \"big girl\" bed. But once she did, I didn't expect my own sleep to continue to be disrupted as well.\n\nI woke up at every creak of the house, wondering if it was my daughter roaming around, exploring her newfound freedom. I knew it was incredibly unlikely, but I feared that she would unlock the door and walk outside in the middle of the night.\n\nI looked for gadgets designed for this exact situation; there are dozens of devices meant for securing small children in their rooms. The solution I decided on surprised my friends: a home security system. While home security traditionally focuses on keeping intruders out of the house, it also works surprisingly well at keeping tiny humans in.\n\nI did nearly everything wrong during the crib-to-bed transition with my daughter. I made the switch on the same week we returned from an international trip, which involved a 15-hour time difference and jet lag that made us both feel delirious. And, instead of researching recommended ways to introduce her to the bed and help her learn to stay in her room at night, I just winged it. I sat outside her door, exhausted, and put her back into bed every time she came out.\n\nNight after night, it did not get any easier.\n\nFinally, I changed my approach and researched the best ways to transition toddlers to a bed. Once I learned the best practices, it clicked, and I kicked myself for not starting there in the first place. I successfully reintroduced my toddler to her new bed, and, as proud as I felt once she started falling asleep peacefully, I still felt unsettled.\n\nEven though she was staying in her room until she fell asleep, I kept wondering what would happen if she wandered out in the middle of the night? The idea that she might slip outside while I was asleep felt far-fetched, but the tiny chance that it could happen lingered in my mind.\n\nThere is a heated debate among parents and experts on whether it is appropriate to lock your toddler in their room at night. Some experts cite the concern as a safety issue: in the event of a fire or other emergency, the child wouldn't be able to get out. Though I realized that when my daughter was previously in her crib, she wouldn't have been able to get out on her own either, which made the safety argument feel less clear-cut to me. Others argue that locking a child in can create emotional distress.\n\nThere's also the other side: preventing a toddler from leaving their room can help keep them safe. I feared that my daughter might get confused in the middle of the night and wander not just out of her room, but out of the house entirely if she wasn't secured in. My daughter is cautious, but toddlers are unpredictable, especially if they unexpectedly wake in the middle of the night. I weighed using a baby gate or doorknob cover, but ultimately decided to get a home security system instead.\n\nWhile there are plenty of DIY home security systems, I'm not handy and didn't have the time or energy to devote to figuring it out. I decided to go with Vivint, a smart home security company, instead. My top priority was getting door sensors so that I would be alerted if anyone opened an outside door at night. This ensured that I didn't have to worry about my daughter quietly leaving the house in the middle of the night. Who knows? This may continue to be beneficial when she becomes a teenager as well.\n\nFrom the catalog, I also added an outdoor camera so I could keep an eye on her in the backyard if she is out playing while I am cooking dinner. I also started planning ahead for features that would be useful when she's older; I decided to get a smart lock for the front door. When she's older and more independent, she will be able to enter the house with a code instead of carrying a key.\n\nDuring the day, the Vivint app is programmed to alert me to different activities around the house. So, I get alerted if my daughter forgets to close the sliding door when she comes inside, among other things. At night, the system is programmed to be armed between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., which means that if anyone opens a door, a loud alarm will sound and the security company notified.\n\nWhen I go to bed, I'm reassured knowing that if my daughter does wander outside at night, whether out of curiosity or confusion, I'll know about it instantly. Now, instead of waking up at every small noise, checking her baby monitor to make sure she's still safely in bed, I finally sleep more soundly.\n\nA security system won't solve bedtime struggles. But it helped me get more rest once my daughter was sleeping well in her new bed. While home security may typically be used to get bad guys out, it can also give you peace of mind that you're keeping your toddler in.",

    "description": "A tattoo artist skipped store-bought gifts and gave her family tattoos, creating a meaningful tradition rooted in creativity and trust.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Madi Ford. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGrowing up, I loved art and was what some might call an \"alternative\" type of teenager. Unlike other parents, my dad always encouraged me to take art classes and never dampened my desire to make art a career.\n\nAt 16, I remember wanting to be a tattoo artist, but I didn't think it was a viable career. I was scared and nervous about making the jump, unsure of the path I needed to follow to make it happen. I even remember telling my dad that maybe I would attend cosmetology school to work on hair instead. He looked at me and said, \"You don't want to do hair. You want to tattoo. Don't give up.\"\n\nWhen I turned 18, I got my first tattoo, and my dad made a big deal about it when I showed him. He took a photo of it and posted it on Instagram. Whereas lots of kids hide tattoos from their parents, I had a dad who encouraged them because he knew how much I loved them.\n\nAfter going in to have my first tattoo, surrounded by a welcoming and creative environment, I decided to ask if I could be an apprentice to one of the artists in the same shop where I had my tattoo done.\n\nThree years later, once I had developed skills and felt ready, I asked my dad and stepmom if they'd like me to do tattoos for them. Dad had a daruma doll, a Japanese wooden doll, and my stepmom had a red-headed nurse to represent her years working as a nurse.\n\nTo give them both something of myself, of my own artistic style, was incredibly meaningful, and it went on to inspire me to do it again for more of my family this past Christmas.\n\nWhile my partner and I typically travel three hours to see my family, we asked my dad, stepmom, stepsister, step-aunt, and her partner to come to us on December 26 instead, and spend a few days in Missoula with us.\n\nI asked them if they'd like me to give each of them a tattoo as a Christmas present, and each of them agreed, thinking in advance about what they'd like to have. They all shared their ideas for the tattoos they wanted and explained why they wanted them. It was a glimpse into who they were and what was important to them.\n\nOn December 26, I opened the shop at 10 a.m., and we spent the day tattooing, taking only a brief break for lunch.\n\nIt was special for me to get to know each of my family members at such a vulnerable point for them. It provides a great icebreaker for conversation and enables me to spend ample time getting to know someone.\n\nAlthough I know my dad and stepmom well, I don't see my other family members often, and this was the perfect opportunity for me to get to know them and for them to get to know me. It was one-on-one time that we wouldn't have had in a large, family gathering.\n\nInstead of giving them a generic Christmas present, I was able to give them a handmade, personalized gift, which was an extension of me. And it's a way to connect and get to know each other on a deeper level.\n\nAnother thing I love about tattooing friends and family is inviting them into my shop, where they can see that tattoo shops are for everyone. They often carry a reputation as being for only the coolest and toughest people, but that's not true, at least not for all of them.\n\nAfter my family had their tattoos, they couldn't stop talking about how much they loved them, and my dad spoke endlessly of how proud he was of me.\n\nI'll definitely be offering the same in the future whenever family comes to visit. I think it might be the best gift I can give them.",

    "description": "I married into a family of 10 and learned that forcing a \"blended family\" made things worse. Living side by side saved us.",
    "fullText": "When my husband and I decided to get married seven years ago, we pictured a modern \"Brady Bunch.\"\n\nBetween us, we had eight children, ranging in age from 3 to 15. We knew it would be a challenge, but we imagined warmth, energy, excitement — maybe even fun.\n\nThe reactions we got should've warned us. \"Wow, that's a lot,\" people would say. Or, \"You must really love each other to take that on.\" But we were sure we'd be different. We'd already been through failed marriages. We were determined not to fail again. We were unrealistically optimistic, and — looking back — very naïve.\n\nWe bought a house, created tiny dorm-style bedrooms so each child had their own space, and set out to \"blend\" our families.\n\nThere were good moments — pasta dinners around our big dining room table, pumpkin carving contests, silly talent shows, and games of croquet in the front yard. But there were also times when nothing felt blended at all. It was like going on vacation with another family: at first, you politely adjust, until suddenly you're thinking, When do they leave so we can get back to normal?\n\nWe hadn't grown together, and our family cultures were completely different. At dinner, my husband or his kids would say something that sent them into hysterics while my offspring and I stared blankly — and vice versa.\n\nAs the months passed, our best intentions felt dangerously close to disaster. I found his parenting too strict. He found mine too permissive. I wanted space from him and his kids. He longed for more unity.\n\nThen our children began clashing — there were fights about 2% milk vs. skim milk, time spent in the bathroom, music preferences, and his daughter's ferret that kept escaping into my daughter's underwear drawer. The more they fought, the more each set of biological siblings rallied to defend each other.\n\nOne weekend at a cabin, hoping to make memories, everything fell apart. Rivalries escalated during a game of \"steal the flag,\" and accusations and hurt feelings ensued. Finally, my husband packed up his kids and drove home early. The moment they left, my side and I let out an involuntary cheer — pure relief.\n\nMy husband and I loved each other, but privately we each wondered if we had made a terrible mistake.\n\nIn desperation, I researched blended families, and everything I read made me feel worse. Even the term felt like an accusation. Nothing about our family resembled a smooth blend. It felt more like a chaotic stew—one no one had asked for. What if blending was simply impossible? What if it wasn't even the right goal?\n\nFacing what felt like collapse, we decided to stop trying to force something that wasn't happening. Instead, we focused on simply living alongside each other with respect. A side-by-side family. I took care of my son and daughters. He took care of his brood. We shared pizza dinners when everyone was home. If one of us planned a game night, the others were invited but never pressured to go. We learned that each child needed alone time with their original parent — and that honoring this made everyone calmer, happier, and more secure.\n\nWe stopped critiquing each other's parenting. We asked for advice only when we genuinely were ready to hear it. We reminded ourselves that we had chosen each other, but the kids hadn't chosen any of this. They deserve time and space to adapt at their own pace.\n\nNearly eight years later, the slow, separate, respectful approach has worked far better than the fantasy \"blend.\" We still have rough days, but most of us get along, there's warmth in the house, and I'd say — slowly, imperfectly — we're marinating together just fine.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic is rolling out a major expansion of its healthcare and life-sciences offerings, as AI companies race to embed large language models more deeply into regulated medical workflows.\n\nThe company on Sunday announced Claude for Healthcare, a product that allows healthcare providers, insurers, and consumers to use Claude for medical purposes through HIPAA-ready infrastructure.\n\nThe launch builds on Anthropic's earlier release of Claude for Life Sciences, which focused on research and drug discovery, and reflects the company's broader effort to position its AI models as practical tools for regulated industries.\n\nThe move also underscores intensifying competition in healthcare AI. OpenAI recently unveiled a rival product, and startups including Abridge and Sword Health have attracted multibillion-dollar valuations as investors pour money into AI tools for medicine.\n\nAnthropic said Claude for Healthcare is designed to reduce administrative work and help both clinicians and patients better understand medical information. The tools are powered by recent improvements to the company's flagship model, Claude Opus 4.5, which Anthropic says performs significantly better than earlier versions on simulated medical and scientific tasks while showing fewer factual errors.\n\nAs part of the healthcare expansion, Claude can now connect directly to several industry-standard databases. These include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Coverage Database, ICD-10 medical coding data, the National Provider Identifier Registry, and PubMed's biomedical research library. Anthropic said these connectors allow Claude to quickly surface relevant information, support prior authorization workflows, and help clinicians and administrators generate reports more efficiently.\n\nThe company is also introducing customizable \"Agent Skills,\" including sample tools for streamlining prior authorization requests and assisting developers in building applications using FHIR, the modern standard for exchanging healthcare data between systems.\n\nOn the consumer side, Anthropic is rolling out integrations that let US subscribers on its Pro and Max plans give Claude secure access to their personal health records. New connectors include HealthEx and Function Health, with Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect integrations launching in beta via Claude's mobile apps. Anthropic said data accessed through these integrations isn't stored in Claude's memory or used to train its models.\n\nAnthropic is also expanding Claude's capabilities for life sciences customers, adding connectors to platforms such as Medidata, ClinicalTrials.gov, and bioRxiv. New agent skills support tasks like drafting FDA- and NIH-compliant clinical trial protocols or monitoring trial performance.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "\"The construction is part of China’s multiyear plan to build a solar great wall.\"",
    "fullText": "A massive solar panel array in China is expected to crack 7,000 megawatts of power generation in 2026, according to EnergiesMedia.\n\nThe Three Gorges Kubuqi Solar Park has been under construction since 2022, blanketing an Inner Mongolian desert in panels. It already has over five gigawatts of capacity installed.\n\n\"Sandy and mostly devoid of life, the Kubuqi Desert in Inner Mongolia once had a reputation for being a 'sea of death.' More recently, its dune fields have become a sea of photovoltaic possibility, transformed by a surge of newly installed solar panels,\" NASA said of the project. \"The construction is part of China's multiyear plan to build a 'solar great wall' designed to generate enough energy to power Beijing.\"\n\nDoing so has the potential to displace China's heavy reliance on coal power. This energy source generates some of the highest levels of pollution in the world, contributing to more destructive weather patterns and steep health costs for locals.\n\nThe Three Gorges Kubuqi Solar Park, due to be completed in 2030, will be 250 miles long, three miles wide, and will be able to generate 100 gigawatts of clean energy. Locals are also enjoying the unexpected benefits of the project.\n\n\"These projects shield us from wind and sand, allowing our village to cultivate over 10,000 mu (600 hectares) of high-standard farmland this year. If leased out, the land can bring villagers 900 yuan ($128) per mu each year,\" said local farmer Han Rongkuan, per Xinhua.\n\nLarge-scale solar is an important step to displacing polluting fuels, like coal, gas, and oil, but home solar does its part, too.\n\n• EnergySage can help you save up to $10,000 on installations by curating competitive bids from local installers \n• Not ready to spend up front? Palmetto's $0-down LightReach solar leasing program can lower your utility rate by up to 20% \n• TCD's Solar Explorer makes it easy to access exclusive offers from preferred partners\n\nYou can get even more out of home solar upgrades by using TCD's HVAC Explorer. It can help save on monthly utility bills with smart heating and cooling solutions. Likewise, the Palmetto Home app can unlock up to $5,000 worth of home upgrades as you take simple daily actions.\n\nWould you cover your home with reflective solar paint?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Richard “Dick” Codey, a former acting governor of New Jersey and the longest serving legislator in the state's history, died Sunday. He was 79.\n\nCodey’s wife, Mary Jo Codey, confirmed her husband’s death to The Associated Press.\n\n“Gov. Richard J. Codey passed away peacefully this morning at home, surrounded by family, after a brief illness,” Codey's family wrote in a Facebook post on Codey's official page.\n\n\"Our family has lost a beloved husband, father and grandfather -- and New Jersey lost a remarkable public servant who touched the lives of all who knew him,\" the family said.\n\nKnown for his feisty, regular-guy persona, Codey was a staunch advocate of mental health awareness and care issues. The Democrat also championed legislation to ban smoking from indoor areas and sought more money for stem cell research.\n\nCodey, the son of a northern New Jersey funeral home owner, entered the state Assembly in 1974 and served there until he was elected to the state Senate in 1982. He served as Senate president from 2002 to 2010.\n\nCodey first served as acting governor for a brief time in 2002, after Christine Todd Whitman’s resignation to join President George W. Bush’s administration. He held the post again for 14 months after Gov. Jim McGreevey resigned in 2004.\n\nAt that time, New Jersey law mandated that the Senate president assume the governor’s role if a vacancy occurred, and that person would serve until the next election.\n\nCodey routinely drew strong praise from residents in polls, and he gave serious consideration to seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2005. But he ultimately chose not to run when party leaders opted to back wealthy Wall Street executive Jon Corzine, who went on to win the office.\n\nCodey would again become acting governor after Corzine was incapacitated in April 2007 due to serious injuries he suffered in a car accident. He held the post for nearly a month before Corzine resumed his duties.\n\nAfter leaving the governor’s office, Codey returned to the Senate and also published a memoir that detailed his decades of public service, along with stories about his personal and family life.\n\n“He lived his life with humility, compassion and a deep sense of responsibility to others,” his family wrote. “He made friends as easily with Presidents as he did with strangers in all-night diners.”\n\nCodey and his wife often spoke candidly about her past struggles with postpartum depression, and that led to controversy in early 2005, when a talk radio host jokingly criticized Mary Jo and her mental health on the air.\n\nCodey, who was at the radio station for something else, confronted the host and said he told him that he wished he could “take him outside.” But the host claimed Codey actually threatened to “take him out,” which Codey denied.\n\nHis wife told The Associated Press that Codey was willing to support her speaking out about postpartum depression, even if it cost him elected office.\n\n“He was a really, really good guy,” Mary Jo Codey said. “He said, ‘If you want to do it, I don’t care if I get elected again.’”\n\nJack Brook contributed reporting from New Orleans.",

    "description": "It joins over 400 other centers in Texas and signals the growth of the tech scene in Medina County.",
    "fullText": "Yet another data center will soon emerge near the Far Westside of San Antonio, according to a recent Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) filing. It's set to further the Lone Star State's reputation as a tech cluster.\n\nThe quaint town of Castroville, with a population of just over 3,000, will soon house a $400 million development owned by Microsoft. Online records show that the project, named SAT 82, will take up roughly 195,000 square feet in Medina County.\n\nAlthough it's only a one-story building, it will take nearly two years to build, according to the TDLR. Construction at the spot, 3580 FM 471 North, will begin on Thursday, August 13, 2026. A visit to the property revealed that equipment and a welcome poster were already on site. An open field, a two-lane road, and residential properties sit nearby.\n\nIn time, the structure will likely take on the look of a windowless warehouse. It may be hard for residents to get a clear glimpse of the center, as each contains extensive fencing around its perimeters for safety and security purposes, Microsoft's website states.\n\nSAT 82 joins six others in Medina County, according to the TDLR: SAT 80, SAT 81, SAT 89/90, SAT 93, SAT 94, and another with the title SAT 82, but with a different address.\n\nThe centers provide the infrastructure needed to open a phone application, join a virtual Zoom meeting, play an online game, and more. According to the company's website, they also allow the company's Azure cloud platform, AI, and collaboration tools to continue operating as normal.\n\nEarlier this fall, community members in a private Redbird Ranch neighborhood Facebook group voiced concerns over Microsoft's presence in the area. A few users worried the company's projects would worsen traffic. Others highlighted the massive amount of water that data centers use.\n\nIn a 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft said that its water consumption in 2023 - which includes but is not limited to data centers - increased by 1.7 billion gallons from the previous year, coming in at 2.1 billion gallons. The company attributed the increase to its business growth.\n\n\"Improvements as part of our Redmond campus modernization project are estimated to yield over 50% reduction in water use for new facilities,\" it continued in the report.\n\nConstruction on the property is expected to wrap up by 2028, according to the TDLR.\n\nThis article originally published at Microsoft bets $400M on tiny Texas town with new massive data center.",

    "description": "The German government has sharply rejected accusations by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claiming that it has been sidelining patient autonomy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The German government has sharply rejected accusations by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claiming that it has been sidelining patient autonomy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“The statements made by the US Secretary of Health are completely unfounded, factually incorrect, and must be rejected,” German Health Minister Nina Warken said in a statement late Saturday.\n\nKennedy said in a video post earlier on Saturday that he had sent the German minister a letter based on reports coming out of Germany that the government was “limiting people’s abilities to act on their own convictions when they face medical decisions.”\n\nThe American health secretary said that “I've learned that more than a thousand German physicians and thousands of their patients now face prosecution and punishment for issuing exemptions from wearing masks or getting COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\"\n\nWarken rejected Kennedy’s claims, saying that “during the coronavirus pandemic, there was never any obligation on the medical profession to administer COVID-19 vaccinations. Anyone who did not want to offer vaccinations for medical, ethical, or personal reasons was not liable to prosecution, nor did they have to fear sanctions.”\n\nKennedy did not give provide specific examples or say which reports he was referring to but added that “in my letter, I explained that Germany is targeting physicians who put their patients first and punishing citizens for making their own medical choices.”\n\nHe concluded that \"the German government is now violating the sacred patient physician relationship, replacing it is a dangerous system that makes physicians enforcers of state policies.”\n\nKennedy said that in his letter he made clear that “Germany has the opportunity and the responsibility to correct this trajectory, to restore medical autonomy, to end politically motivated prosecutions.”\n\nWarken pointed out that there were no professional bans or fines for not getting vaccinated.\n\n“Criminal prosecution was only pursued in cases of fraud and document forgery, such as the issuance of false vaccination certificates or fake mask certificates,\" the minister said.\n\nShe also clarified that in general in Germany “patients are also free to decide which therapy they wish to undergo.”\n\nFormer German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who was in charge during the pandemic, also replied, addressing Kennedy directly on X saying that he “should take care of health problems in his own country. Short life expectancy, extreme costs, tens of thousands of drug deaths and murder victims.\"\n\n“In Germany, doctors are not punished by the government for issuing false medical certificates. In our country, the courts are independent,” Lauterbach wrote.\n\nWhile a majority of Germans were eager to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus during the pandemic, there were also protests by a small minority of vaccine skeptics in Germany which were sometimes supported by far-right movements.",

    "description": "A Satoshi-era Bitcoin miner reactivated long-dormant wallets to move 2,000 BTC, worth about $181 million, to Coinbase.",
    "fullText": "A Bitcoin miner from the network’s earliest days has emerged from dormancy to shift 2,000 BTC, a strategic profit-taking move valued at approximately $181 million.\n\nCryptoQuant's Julio Moreno noted that this represents the most significant activity by a \"Satoshi-era\" whale since late 2024.\n\nMoreno highlighted the timing of the transaction and observed that \"Satoshi-era miners [tend to] move their Bitcoin at key inflection points.\"\n\nAdding technical context, Sani, the founder of TimechainIndex, confirmed that the funds originated from block rewards mined in 2010. Notably, the blockchain network had rewarded early miners of that era with 50 BTC in block subsidies.\n\nThe coins had remained untouched for more than 15 years across 40 legacy Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses. They were later consolidated and transferred to Coinbase.\n\nTypically, market analysts interpret transfers to centralized exchanges as a prelude to an open-market sale.\n\nMeanwhile, this transaction is not an isolated anomaly but underscores a developing trend of \"vintage\" supply hitting the market.\n\nOver the past year, wallets from the 2009–2011 era have been increasingly reactivated across the Bitcoin network. The activity reflects early holders moving to lock-in gains or update long-standing custody arrangements.\n\nFor context, Galaxy Digital had executed one of the largest crypto sales in history by helping a Satoshi-era investor to sell more than $9 billion in July 2025.\n\nCrucially, the market has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid this selling pressure. Bitcoin successfully absorbed these large-scale \"OG\" supply shocks without suffering a breakdown in market structure.\n\nThis signals that while Bitcoin's early adopters are moving to lock in generational wealth, the market's liquidity remains deep enough to handle their exits.\n\nHowever, despite the immediate sell-side pressure from legacy holders, long-term institutional forecasts remain bullish.\n\nIn a report released last week, asset manager VanEck projected that Bitcoin could reach a theoretical valuation of $2.9 million per coin by 2050. The firm’s thesis relies on the asset’s potential adoption as a global settlement currency.\n\nRead original story Satoshi-Era Miner Moves Millions in Bitcoin After 15 Years of Silence by Oluwapelumi Adejumo at beincrypto.com",

    "description": "“It was extremely difficult,” IgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan tells Fortune. “But changing minds was harder than adding skills.”",
    "fullText": "Eric Vaughan, CEO of enterprise-software powerhouse IgniteTech, was unwavering as he reflected on the most radical decision of his decades-long career. In early 2023, convinced generative AI was an “existential” transformation, Vaughan looked at his team and saw a workforce not fully on board. His ultimate response: He ripped the company down to the studs, replacing nearly 80% of staff within a year, according to headcount figures reviewed by Fortune.\n\nOver the course of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024, Vaughan told Fortune, IgniteTech replaced hundreds of employees, declining to disclose a specific number. “That was not our goal,” he told Fortune. “It was extremely difficult … But changing minds was harder than adding skills.” It was, by any measure, a brutal reckoning—but Vaughan insists it was necessary, and said he’d do it again.\n\nFor Vaughan, the writing on the wall was clear and dramatic.\n\n“In early 2023, we saw the light,” he told Fortune in an August 2025 interview, adding he believed every tech company was facing a crucial inflection point around adoption of artificial intelligence. “Now I’ve certainly morphed to believe that this is every company, and I mean that literally every company, is facing an existential threat by this transformation.”\n\nWhere others saw promise, Vaughan saw urgency—believing failing to get ahead on AI could doom even the most robust business. He called an all-hands meeting with his global remote team. Gone were the comfortable routines and quarterly goals. Instead, his message was direct: Everything would now revolve around AI. “We’re going to give a gift to each of you. And that gift is tremendous investment of time, tools, education, projects … to give you a new skill,” he explained. The company began reimbursing for AI tools and prompt-engineering classes, and even brought in outside experts to evangelize.\n\n“Every single Monday was called ‘AI Monday,’” Vaughan said, with his mandate for staff that they could work only on AI. “You couldn’t have customer calls; you couldn’t work on budgets; you had to only work on AI projects.” He said this happened across the board, not just for tech workers, but also for sales, marketing, and everybody else at IgniteTech. “That culture needed to be built. That was the key.”\n\nThis was a major investment, he added: 20% of payroll was dedicated to a mass-learning initiative, and it failed because of mass resistance, even sabotage. Belief, Vaughan discovered, is a hard thing to manufacture.",

    "fullText": "Manager Danny Rohl enthused about many aspects of Rangers' controlled 2-0 victory away to Aberdeen, including his side's \"clean sheet mentality\".\n\nA fifth successive victory keeps Rangers three points behind Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts.\n\nSince Rohl took over in October, his side have shipped just eight goals in 14 league games, winning 11 of those, while keeping the opposition out on eight occasions.\n\nRangers kept one just one blank in Russell Martin's seven Premiership games, a soporific Old Firm derby stalemate.\n\n\"We defended until the end and we got a clean sheet,\" Rohl told RangersTV.\n\n\"This is the basis and if we do this again and again we will be in a fantastic way. Keep on the front foot, stay hungry, stay ambitious, and be humble in the right moments.\"\n\nIn the wind and rain at Pittodrie, Aberdeen were limited to five efforts on target, with Jack Butland's only save of note thwarting Leighton Clarkson in the first half.\n\n\"Big, big pride in my group, to come to a really tough place,\" said Rohl in his post-match media conference. \"We showed again different faces, which is what we need.\n\n\"We played good men's football, we were ready in the duels, second balls.\n\n\"We understood when to play in behind, then we understand also to keep the ball in the right areas.\n\n\"The result was enjoyable, of course, it's great to see.\n\n\"We were really focused until the end and it is outstanding what we have done, five wins in a row.\"\n\nRangers solidity is all the more impressive when you consider first choice centre-backs John Souttar and Derek Cornelius have been missing.\n\nThe Canada international has been out since early November, while Souttar was absent for six matches.\n\nHowever, it is no surprise that the Scotland defender's return coincides with the current five-game winning run.\n\nSouttar made a great early block from Nicolas Milanovic at Pittodrie and was constantly marshalling the backline, keeping the occasionally errant Emmanuel Fernandez close and focused.\n\nFernandez may be prone to the odd lapse but the 24-year-old, who was playing in England's League One last season, is an imposing figure.\n\nHe has four goals from his run of 11 successive starts and was denied another by a debatable VAR review in Aberdeen.\n\nA menace at set-pieces in the opposition box, he is handy at nodding them away at the other end too, and Nasser Djiga is likely to have to wait patiently on the bench now that he is back from the Africa Cup of Nations with Burkina Faso.",

    "fullText": "Also: advice to reduce screen time, how to maximize your toaster oven, the best gloves and at-home fitness staples\n\nThis piece was originally published in the Filter US newsletter on buying fewer, better things. \nEach week we cut through the noise to bring you smart, practical recommendations on how to live better – from what is worth buying to the tools, habits and ideas that actually last.\n\nAt this time last year, I was a full-time student, throwing on the requisite leggings and an oversized sweatshirt for evening classes and late-night library sessions. This year, I’ve joined countless others in office life, zipping in and out of conference rooms and hopping on video calls for interviews and meetings. I love any excuse to shop, but many office-friendly pieces, including pricey blazers and crisp button-downs, are far outside my price range.\n\nBut perhaps my work wardrobe doesn’t have to break the bank.\n\nRecently, we wrote about how the New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, pulled off the budget-friendly suits he sported throughout his campaign. And that inspired me to search for affordable ways to build my office wardrobe.\n\nRead the full story here: How Mamdani makes affordable suits look expensive – and you can too\n\nSo I asked wardrobe stylist Samantha Elise how we can get dressed for the office without racking up a hefty credit card bill, sending us back to the 80s or sacrificing personal style.\n\nThe 27 best fashion gifts in the US – curated by our favorite stylists and creators\n\nEight winter clothing essentials Scandinavians swear by – from heated socks to ‘allværsjakke’\n\nI don’t have a full-length mirror in my apartment, so I put Elise’s advice to the test in a dressing room near the Guardian’s New York City office (as you can see in the image above).\n\nWe’ve all been tempted by a cheap pair of pants or a T-shirt that costs less than a cup of coffee – even as we know the devastating environmental costs of fast fashion. Elise says we should spend a bit more on wardrobe basics, such as a black pair of pants or a trenchcoat.\n\n“Pieces that you can pare everything back to are what I would invest in, because that’s what’s creating that reliable foundation in your closet,” Elise said.\n\nShe says the best way to identify high-quality pieces is to touch the items. “Nine times out 10, the feeling alone lets you know the quality. I know I’ve come across good denim when it feels thick and sturdy.”\n\nBrands like Aritzia and Madewell are a few of Elise’s go-tos for well-made basics. (We checked, and they both have straightforward return policies if you’re planning to do the touch test at home.) For those of us lucky enough to be able to wear jeans to work, she recommended Citizens of Humanity and Agolde for higher-quality denim.\n\nWhen I think of office attire, I can’t help but picture drab pencil skirts and plenty of beige. But even on a budget, there are strategies that can elevate your ensemble while remaining professional.\n\n“Find elements that feel true to yourself, like a pattern or a pop of color,” Elise said. She also advised experimenting with different silhouettes, such as white tees that hit below your elbow or a pair of balloon pants.\n\nBuy statement pieces second-hand\n\n“Go on Depop and find something for $20 versus spending $400 on a designer [striped shirt]. All stripes look the same. Let’s not waste money there, because then you have the striped shirt and no pants to wear it with,” Elise said.\n\nShop your closet with fresh eyes\n\nElise advised finding inspiration to breathe new life into what you already own. She uses Pinterest as a starting point to build her outfits.\n\n“There’s a lot of second-guessing when it comes to [putting together outfits]. You have more answers than you think you do. So trust yourself and be creative,” she said.\n\nAnd for a wallet-friendly way to spice up an office outfit, Elise recommended playing with layering, such as tying a sweater over your shoulders or a blazer around your waist.\n\nAre you trying to put an end to your nightly doom scroll? We’ve shared a few unique tips for cutting down on the amount of time you spend staring at a screen, brought to you by experts.\n\nFrom going analog to writing a breakup letter to your phone, we gathered some unconventional tips that go beyond setting time limits or silencing your device.\n\nRead the full story here: ‘Put a rubber band on your phone’: I asked experts how to reduce screen time – here’s what they said\n\nGorpcore is having a moment. And winter gloves are very much a part of it.\n\nFilter US editor Nick Mokey shared the military surplus-style glove combination that he swears by for everything from camping to biking. The best part? They’re far more affordable (and probably warmer) than the fancy designer pair you’ve been eyeing.\n\nRead the full story here: The best winter gloves are two pairs, actually (and one is hiding at Home Depot)\n\nPro chef Kiki Aranita wants you to use your toaster oven for more than making toast.\n\nBreville Joule Oven Air Fryer Pro\n\nFrom cooking up an impressive batch of air-fried crispy noodles for your next dinner party to pretending it’s summer and making s’mores from the comfort of your kitchen, the toaster oven is a true kitchen multitasker.\n\nRead her tips here: From eggs to s’mores: 10 foods you didn’t know your toaster oven could make\n\nIf you’re put off by burpees on your hardwood floor or sun salutations in your garage, we’re here to tell you there’s a better way to get an at-home workout.\n\nTo help find the best products to revamp your 2026 fitness routine (without leaving the comfort of your house), we asked personal trainer Marissa Miller to outline a few of her favorites, including a durable Lululemon yoga mat and a lower-intensity alternative to weight lifting.\n\nRead the full story here: A personal trainer’s starter pack: 10 US workout products to reboot for 2026",

    "fullText": "From being branded an \"idiot\" to scoring a hat-trick, Gabriel Martinell's name has been in the headlines over the past few days.\n\nThe Arsenal winger was heavily criticised for trying to push the injured Conor Bradley off the pitch in the closing stages of Arsenal's 0-0 draw with Liverpool on Thursday, something he apologised for on social media.\n\nBut the 24-year-old's first hat-trick for Arsenal - as they came from behind to beat Championship outfit Portsmouth and reach the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday - showed \"personality\", according to his boss.\n\n\"It's part of football and then it's how you take it,\" Mikel Arteta when asked how Martinelli has dealt with being the subject of so much discussion.\n\n\"But he knew inside the reason why he did what he did.\"\n\nArteta also praised Liverpool boss Arne Slot for his considered response to the incident, when he defended the Brazilian.\n\n\"I think Arne Slot spoke brilliantly after the game - speaking of your opponent in the manner that he explained the situation and the fact that Gabi had no intention whatsoever to damage any player,\" added Arteta.\n\n\"That's personality. Come in and talk on the pitch, which is the best part of it.\"\n\nMartinelli has had a mixed season, losing his starting place in the Premier League to Leandro Trossard after a drop in form and confidence.\n\nHe has started just six times for the Gunners, who are six points clear at the top of the table.\n\nHowever, the winger has been a key player this season for Arsenal in Champions League, scoring five goals in as many appearances. And after his hat-trick against Portsmouth, he is now his side's top scorer.\n\n\"That's why to play for a big club, you need a big personality because it can be bad... it can be an action that you miss, it can be something that costs you a game,\" Arteta added\n\n\"And three days later, there is a game. So you need to lift yourself up and make it count.\n\n\"I love it. Gabi, in every context that you throw him in, he plays, he doesn't play. He performs well, not well. Today, he scored three goals.\n\n\"Tomorrow, he's going to train 100 miles an hour, for sure. He's not going to change that. And that's Gabi.\"",

    "fullText": "Tries: Segun 2, T Willis Con: Burke Pen: Farrell\n\nTries: Kinghorn, Lebel Cons: Ramos 2\n\nSaracens produced an outstanding performance in testing conditions to beat Toulouse 20-14 and all but secure their place in the last 16 of the Champions Cup.\n\nThey held a blunt review of their stuttering season after a poor defeat at Leicester last weekend, saying they had \"confronted what was wrong\" and were ready to \"do the talking on the field\" against the six-time European champions.\n\nMark McCall's side did just that at a wet and windy StoneX, fronting up to the star-studded Toulouse side with their best display of the season.\n\nNumber eight Tom Willis, whose elder brother Jack was in Toulouse's back row, gave another stellar performance to underline how much he will be missed when he moves to Bordeaux at the end of the season.\n\nRotimi Segun scored two of their tries and man of the match Willis bagged the other as Saracens scored 17 unanswered first-half points to take control of the match.\n\n\"A lot of people thought we were going to lose that game and probably rightly so because of some of our performances so far this season,\" said captain Maro Itoje.\n\n\"The challenge for us now is to make sure we're consistent. We're not saying that we're going to win every game, but the fight and the mentality needs to be consistent.\n\n\"For me, it actually wasn't really about the result. It was about the character of the team and how we were going to show up.\"\n\nChampions Cup key moments and qualification stakes\n\nRelive Sunday's Champions Cup action as it happened\n\nThings looked ominous when Toulouse fly-half Blair Kinghorn scored the opening try following sustained pressure, but Saracens responded with three tries in 10 minutes.\n\nThe first came when Samoan flanker Theo McFarland charged down Antoine Dupont's kick and raced forward to gather the ball. Jamie George and Willis took over the charge before the ball was eventually moved left to Segun to finish.\n\nThree-time champions Saracens almost scored again moments later. Fly-half Fergus Burke produced a brilliant burst of speed and sent an enticing kick through only for Alex Lozowski to fumble the bouncing ball as he dived over the line.\n\nLozowski, making his comeback from an Achilles tendon injury, made amends with an outrageous dummy pass that released Segun, who raced past his marker to score his second.\n\nSaracens forwards struggled early on against the huge Toulouse pack, but with the momentum now in their favour the hosts surged towards the line again. Willis stretched over, letting out a massive roar as he rose to his feet having helped his side secure a healthy 17-7 lead.\n\nToulouse scored early in the second half through wing Matthis Lebel but with conditions deteriorating rapidly, and their captain Dupont strangely quiet, that was their last score of the game.\n\nWillis made a crucial turnover to prevent a possible try but otherwise the French league leaders lacked any sort of fluency in attack.\n\nOwen Farrell and Ben Earl came on to lend their experience, and the former England captain stretched the lead to six points with a penalty.\n\nSaracens held on without any major scares to secure a famous win - and bragging rights for Tom over his brother Jack.\n\n\"Tom is a massive player for us,\" added Itoje. \"He's a great ball-carrier. He's probably the most awkward ball-carrier I've seen.\n\n\"He finds a way to go forward off a standing start and he can just wriggle his body, wriggle his hips through contact. He was fantastic.\n\n\"Both Willises played well but I'll give it by just a slight nudge to Tom.\"\n\nTom said it had been \"a bit of a weird and emotional day\" playing against his brother.\n\n\"He banged me early on, I knew he was dialled in for it,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"He's a brilliant player and caused us havoc at the breakdown as always.\n\n\"I saw him on Friday and Saturday but a few hours before kick-off he went a bit quiet. I tried to wind him up but it didn't work.\"\n\nSarries will bid for the top spot in Pool 1 when they face group leaders Glasgow Warriors away next Sunday, but a losing bonus point would be enough to guarantee their progress to the knockout stage.\n\nToulouse have now lost two group games, having been humbled 28-21 by Glasgow in December, and head into their final match at Sale on Saturday potentially needing to win to go through.\n\nBordeaux thump Northampton in Champions Cup repeat\n\nDavid hat-trick seals Harlequins knockout spot\n\nSaracens: Daly; Caluori, Lozowski, Hartley, Segun; Burke, Van Zyl; Mawi, George, Street, Itoje (capt), Tizard, McFarland, Gonzalez, Willis.\n\nReplacements: Hadfield, Carre, Riccioni, Onyeama-Christie,Earl, Bracken, Farrell, Malins.\n\nToulouse: Ramos; Delibes, Costes, Chocobares, Lebel; Kinghorn, Dupont (capt); Ainu'u, Marchand, Aldegheri, Flament, Meafou, Willis, Jelonch, Roumat.\n\nReplacements: Mauvaka, Bertrand, Mallez, Brennan, Elias, Banos, Graou, Vigneres.\n\nAssistant referees: Ru Campbell (Sco), Federico Vedovelli (Ita)",

    "fullText": "Life moves fast at Manchester United.\n\nWhen Brighton last visited Old Trafford 11 weeks ago, a third successive win seemed to be a clear sign of a corner being turned under Ruben Amorim.\n\nWind forward to the present day.\n\nThe grey clouds enveloped Old Trafford and the rain fell during Sunday's FA Cup third-round defeat by Brighton. It was a fitting metaphor.\n\nAmorim is gone, United have fallen at the first hurdle in both domestic cup competitions for the first time since 1981-82. They are condemned to a 40-game season, the fewest they have played since 1914-15.\n\nThe world's oldest person, 116-year-old Ethel Caterham, was five at the time, so even she probably doesn't remember it.\n\nAfter a two-game trip to Asia at the end of last season to plug a financial hole, now the mooted mid-season trip to Saudi Arabia has to become more likely - as there is a 10-day window in United's season in February and March, given the FA Cup fourth and fifth round weekends are, for them, blank.\n\nBefore that, United host Manchester City next Saturday with no manager in place to lift their \"fragile\" confidence.\n\nThey have one win in seven games, a fortunate triumph against Newcastle on 26 December.\n\nOut of 13 matches since the previous Brighton visit, they have enjoyed three victories.\n\nWhile their current position of seventh in the Premier League is not catastrophic, if results against Manchester City and Arsenal go to form, they could be firmly in the bottom half of the table by the time they entertain Fulham on 1 February, when the 1958 Group of supporters plan a mass demonstration against the ownership.",

And how do things currently stand?\n\nThe top four teams from each pool qualify for the last 16, with the top two qualifying with home advantage.\n\nFifth in each pool drops down to the Challenge Cup, while the bottom side are eliminated.\n\nAnd a reminder that it's four points for a win, with bonus points available for scoring four tries and losing by seven points or fewer.",
