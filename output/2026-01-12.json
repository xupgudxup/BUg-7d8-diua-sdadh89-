    "description": "A look at the Patriots’ game day roster for their wild card matchup on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots offensive line proved a model of stability early on in the season, starting the same five players in 10 of their first 11 weeks of the season. However, starting with their win over the Bengals idn late November, the team had to begin relying on its backups: left tackle Will Campbell and left guard Jared Wilson both suffered injuries that prompted them to miss some time.\n\nOn Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers, the Patriots’ starting five will be back together again for the first time since that game in Cincinnati. Not only is Campbell ready for a second straight week after being activated from injured reserve, Wilson also has been cleared from concussion protocol.\n\nWith them back in the lineup, and both center Garrett Bradbury and right tackle Morgan Moses overcoming the illnesses that held them out of practice earlier in the week, the Patriots O-line is back again just in time for the playoffs to begin.\n\nNew England’s full game day roster versus L.A. looks as follows:\n\nQuarterback (2): Drake Maye (10), Joshua Dobbs (11)\n\nRunning back (4): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), D’Ernest Johnson (34 | KR), Jack Westover (37 | FB/TE)\n\nWide receiver (5): Kayshon Boutte (9), Stefon Diggs (8), Kyle Williams (18), DeMario Douglas (3), Efton Chism III (86)\n\nTight end (2): Hunter Henry (85), Austin Hooper (81)\n\nOffensive tackle (4): Will Campbell (66 | LT), Morgan Moses (76 | RT), Vederian Lowe (59), Thayer Munford Jr. (74)\n\nInterior offensive line (4): Jared Wilson (58 | LG), Garrett Bradbury (65 | C), Mike Onwenu (71 | RG), Ben Brown (77)\n\nInterior defensive line (5): Milton Williams (97), Christian Barmore (90), Cory Durden (94), Eric Gregory (55), Leonard Taylor III (93 | PS elevation)\n\nDefensive edge (4): Harold Landry III (2), K’Lavon Chaisson (44), Anfernee Jennings (33), Elijah Ponder (91)\n\nLinebacker (6): Robert Spillane (14), Christian Elliss (53), Jack Gibbens (51), Jahlani Tavai (48), Marte Mapu (15), Chad Muma (49)\n\nCornerback (5): Christian Gonzalez (0), Carlton Davis III (7), Marcus Jones (25 | PR), Charles Woods (22), Kobee Minor (19)\n\nSafety (4): Jaylinn Hawkins (21), Craig Woodson (31), Dell Pettus (24), Brenden Schooler (41)\n\nSpecialists (3): Andy Borregales (36 | K), Bryce Baringer (17 | P/H), Julian Ashby (47 | LS)\n\nThe Patriots defense received a boost on Sunday. Besides edge defender Harold Landry being cleared from the knee injury that had held him out the previous two games and landed him on the questionables list heading into the weekend, off-ball linebacker Robert Spillane is also about to make his comeback. Spillane had missed four straight games because of an ankle injury.\n\nWith the duo back in action, their respective position groups will see some change. On the edge, Anfernee Jennings and Elijah Ponder will likely resume more rotational roles again, while Brady Swinson was deemed inactive. Off the ball, Jack Gibbens returns to the top backup role he held before Spillane’s absence.\n\nInactives (7): QB Tommy DeVito (16), WR Jeremiah Webb (29 | PS elevation), TE C.J. Dippre (82), OT Marcus Bryant (52), OL Caedan Wallace (70), DT Khyiris Tonga (95), ED Bradyn Swinson (43)\n\nPractice squad (14): RB Elijah Mitchell (45), WR John Jiles (83), WR Brandon Smith (80), TE Marshall Lang (—), OL Sebastian Gutierrez (—), OL Brenden Jaimes (61), OL Andrew Rupcich (67), OL Mehki Butler (63), DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (98), DT Fabien Lovett Sr. (96), LB Amari Gainer (99), LB Otis Reese (54), S Richie Grant (39), S John Saunders Jr. (23)\n\nPractice squad/injured (3): RB Craig Reynolds (49), LB Darius Harris (42), TE Thomas Odukoya (88 | IPPP)\n\nReserve/injured (11): FB Brock Lampe, OT Yasir Durant, CB Marcellas Dial Jr., DT Jaquelin Roy, RB Lan Larison, RB Deneric Prince, DT Isaiah Iton, RB Antonio Gibson, CB Alex Austin (IR-R), RB Terrell Jennings, DT Joshua Farmer, WR Mack Hollins\n\nReserve/retired (1): OL Wes Schweitzer\n\nThe Patriots elevated two players from their practice squad for Sunday’s contest, but only one of them is actually in line to play. Whereas Leonard Taylor will likely factor into the interior defensive line mix for a third game this season, Jeremiah Webb will watch the action from the sideline. With Kayshon Boutte being given the green light, there is no place on him on the game day roster.\n\nNew England’s playoff opener against the Chargers is set for an 8 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.",

    "fullText": "Leylah Fernandez will have big plans for her 2026 season on the WTA Tour, which she has already got underway.\n\nFernandez lost her opening match at the Brisbane International, where the 13th seed was beaten by Dayana Yastremska.\n\nThe Canadian, who lost 6-1, 6-2, now turns her focus to the Adelaide International, where she will play both singles and doubles.\n\nFernandez will play against Diana Shnaider in the former, while she and Timea Babos will take on Sofia Kenin and Laura Siegemund in the latter.\n\nAhead of the tournament, the 2021 US Open runner-up shared insight into her personal life by answering various questions on her Instagram.\n\nOne question focused on her career if she wasn’t a tennis player, to which the Canadian said: “100% I’d be a soccer/futbol player.”\n\nFernandez also shared her background in another answer, explaining: “I am Canadian. I was born in Montreal, Canada, speak French and English.\n\n“My mom was born in Toronto, Canada, and my grandparents are from the Philippines. My dad was born in Ecuador and that is why I speak Spanish.”\n\nFernandez is evidently a keen football fan, but it’s clear she made the right decision by moving into tennis.\n\nThe 23-year-old boasts five career titles on the WTA Tour, and once reached as high as number 13 in the world rankings.\n\nHer only Grand Slam final appearance came at the US Open back in 2021, when she lost out to Emma Raducanu.\n\nShe’s also experienced Grand Slam doubles heartache, having lost the 2023 French Open doubles final playing with Taylor Townsend.\n\nFernandez is currently ranked 22nd on the WTA Tour, and she will be the 22nd seed at the upcoming Australian Open.",

In bad news, Lucas Hernandez has been unexpectedly ruled out.\n\nPSG will face Paris FC this Monday in the Coupe de France round of 16 without any reinforcements from the medical room. Luis Enrique has received no good news from the infirmary in recent hours, as shown by the day's medical update, which the club has just released.\n\nThe three injury absentees remain the same. But to these expected absences has been added bad news, namely that Lucas Hernandez is ill and \"is resting.\"\n\nRegarding the three injured players, PSG specifies that \"Quentin Ndjantou continues his treatment protocol,\" while Kang In Lee and Matvei Safonov are doing adapted work.\"\n\nThe return is relatively close for the latter two, particularly the South Korean. For the Russian goalkeeper, a return to competition was previously mentioned for late January or early February after his left-hand fracture.\n\nGiven that Achraf Hakimi and Ibrahim Mbaye are still involved in the Africa Cup of Nations – the Moroccan fullback and Senegalese winger will play their respective semifinals next Wednesday – this means there will be no fewer than six absentees on PSG's side for this second derby of the season against Paris FC.\n\nThe medical update before PSG vs. Paris FC:\n\nQuentin Ndjantou continues his treatment protocol.\n\nKang In Lee and Matvei Safonov are doing adapted work.\n\nRoundtablesports is Free to join!

We'll see how the week goes and see how he can help us.”\n\nSafety has been a turnstile for weeks opposite second-year standout Calen Bullock. C.J. Gardner-Johnson initially was the starter before being released in Week 3 due to his role with the defense. M.J. Stewart, who suffered a quadriceps injury earlier this season, is out for the season. Houston hasn't activated veteran defensive back Jimmie Ward yet, instead relying on former practice squad players like K'Von Wallace and Myles Bryant.\n\nReed, who had worked his way into a starting role, had a metal plate placed inside his forearm after making a tackle against the Colts in Week 13. Before that, he was named a starter after recording 11 tackles and a fumble recovery against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nA sixth-round draft pick out of Penn State, Reed was a former second-team All-Big Ten Conference selection who has a hard-hitting presence. In seven games, Reed has totaled 14 tackles, a pass breakup and recovered a fumble.\n\nKickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. on ESPN.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: Jaylen Reed injury update: Will Texans rookie DB play vs. Steelers?",

    "fullText": "Was Jauan Jennings ever a quarterback? 49ers WR connects with Christian McCaffrey on Philly special trick play vs. Eagles originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith George Kittle out for the remainder of the game and the offense stalled, the San Francisco 49ers had to get creative against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nKyle Shanahan dialed up a beauty of a play in the third quarter, with WR Jauan Jennings throwing a touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey to give the 49ers the lead.\n\n49ers fans -- and Kansas City Chiefs fans -- remember that connection well. Jennings previously hit McCaffrey for a touchdown in Super Bowl 58. \nThe design of the play was eerily similar to the famed trick play that helped their opponent win Super Bowl LII in 2018.\n\nHere's a look at the trick play and Jennings' history as a quarterback.\n\nLIVE:Follow updates from 49ers vs. Eagles in wild-card playoff game\n\nShanahan dug deep into his playbook on first-and-10 with the 49ers in field goal range. Brock Purdy handed off to Skyy Moore, who tossed it backwards to Jennings, only for Jennings to run to his right and find a wide-open McCaffrey for the go-ahead touchdown.\n\nJAUAN JENNINGS TD PASS TO CMC\n\nSFvsPHI on FOX/FOX One\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/18VxTpTKgj\n\nThe play instantly breathed life into a 49ers offense that hadn't scored since the first half and hadn't scored a touchdown since the opening drive of the game.\n\nHere's a closer look at why a pass from Jennings might have been no surprise for those who know his background.\n\nMORE:What to know about George Kittle's Achilles injury\n\nJennings committed to Tennessee as a quarterback in the class of 2015, after playing the position at Blackman High School in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He actually ranked ahead of Sam Darnold, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow in his class, according to 247 Sports.\n\nJennings was converted into a wide receiver under Butch Jones with the Volunteers, a decision that ultimately helped him become an NFL Draft pick and eventually a standout piece of the 49ers' offense. Shanahan knows Jennings, strengths, however, and the receiver has two playoff touchdown passes to his name despite never attempting a pass in the regular season.\n\nThe first touchdown pass of Jennings' playoff career came in Super Bowl 58, when he threw a dangerous pass across the field to McCaffrey, who ran it in for a touchdown to extend the 49ers' lead over the Chiefs.\n\nJAUAN JENNINGS THROWING A TD IN THE SUPER BOWL #VFLpic.twitter.com/cYNc169Yhw\n\n— Barstool Rocky Top (@BarstoolTenn) February 12, 2024\n\nJennings also had a receiving touchdown in the game, but San Francisco would lose in overtime.",

Discuss the game and stay tuned for new threads after each quarter.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\n4Q – 2:54 [Eagles 19, Niners 24] — With the help of some penalties. The 49ers were able to take the lead back just before the two-minute warning. They opted to kick an extra point instead of going for two, but they missed and only hold a 4-point buffer.\n\n4Q – 8:00 [Eagles 19, Niners 17] — The Eagles were forced to settle for a field goal, but Jake Elliott was able to connect on a 33 yarder for Philadelphia to retake the lead.\n\n4Q – 14:52 [Eagles 16, Niners 17] — Brock Purdy connected with Christian McCaffrey for a 29-yard touchdown to take the lead for the first time since the first quarter. To make matters worse, Jalen Carter was flagged for roughing the passer which was a penalty imposed on the next play.\n\n3Q – 2:20 [Eagles 16, Niners 10] — After several three-and-outs to start the second half, the Eagles were able to get into field goal range, and Jake Elliott made a 41-yard kick to extend their lead.\n\n2Q – 2:50 [Eagles 13, Niners 10] — The 49ers had to settle for a field goal after Jordan Davis made two clutch stops to force them into fourth down. Eddy Pineiro nailed a 36-yard field goal to inch closer to the Eagles before halftime.\n\nNotable: 49ers TE George Kittle had to be carted off the field during the drive after suffering what appeared to be a torn Achilles.\n\n2Q – 6:08 [Eagles 13, Niners 7] — Dallas Goedert scored his second touchdown of the day on a nine-yard TD pass on 4th-and-2. The 16-play drive had a little bit of everything, including their first tush push of the game, and some Tank Bigsby carries.\n\n1Q – 6:16 [Eagles 6, Niners 7] — The Eagles offense was (surprisingly) quick to respond and scored points off a 10-play drive that was super run-heavy, and ended with a Dallas Goedert TD — his 12th of the season! Unfortunately, Jake Elliott’s issues don’t seem resolved as he missed what could be a very critical point-after attempt.\n\n1Q – 11:51 [Eagles 0, Niners 7] — Well, that wasn’t a great start from the Eagles defense. Vic Fangio’s group gave up a frustrating 61-yard catch and followed that up by allowing several more plays that resulted in the 49ers scoring the first points of the game. Brock Purdy connected with Demarcus Robinson in the back of the endzone for six.\n\nNote: if the tracker isn’t properly loading for you, you can CLICK HERE.\n\nA Twitter List by BleedingGreen",

    "description": "Celtics All-Star forward Jaylen Brown was added to the injury report Sunday for Boston's game against the Pacers Monday with back spasms.",
    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Like the Pacers, the Celtics are going through this season without their franchise player as Boston's Jayson Tatum and Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton both out for the year with Achilles tendon tears. However, the Celtics might also be missing their other All-Star when they play the Pacers at 7:30 p.m. Monday at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nJaylen Brown -- a four-time All-Star as well as a one-time All-NBA pick and the 2024 NBA Finals MVP -- wasn't on the Celtics initial injury report on Sunday but he was added in the evening, listed as doubtful with back spasms. Brown has missed just two games this season and is making a strong case for both All-Star and All-NBA nods and even a darkhorse MVP argument in Tatum's absence. He ranks sixth in the NBA with 29.5 points per game -- which would be a career-high if it holds up throughout the year on 49.5% shooting and 37.6% 3-point shooting. He's also averaging 6.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.0 steals per game. The surprising Celtics are 24-14 and entered Sunday's action in a tie with the Knicks for second place in the Eastern Conference.\n\nCeltics sharp-shooting wing Sam Hauser -- who made 7 of 8 3-pointers for 23 points against the Pacers in Boston's Dec. 26 win at Gainbridge -- is listed as questionable with right hamstring tightness. He's averaging 7.8 points per game and shooting 38.6% from 3-point range. Wing Josh Minott, who signed with the Celtics this summer after three years with Minnesota, is out with a left ankle sprain.\n\nPacers guard Andrew Nembhard is listed as questionable with lower back soreness for the third straight game after missing Thursday's game but posting 29 points and nine assists in Saturday's win over the Heat. Guard Bennedict Mathurin (right thumb sprain) and center Isaiah Jackson (concussion) are still out, though coach Rick Carlisle said Jackson has cleared concussion protocol but has to work himself back into shape. Forward Obi Toppin is out until at least February after surgery to repair a stress fracture in his right foot.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Boston's Jaylen Brown doubtful against Pacers with back spasms",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays have made big moves already this offseason in free agency, and they might have more to come.\n\nOn Sunday, they made a little move, but it's an exciting one in its own way.\n\nAccording to MLB insider Mike Rodriguez, the Blue Jays have signed Eloy Jimenez to a minor league contract. It comes with an invite to big league spring training.\n\nAccording to my sources, Eloy Jiménez has just reached an agreement with the Toronto Blue Jays. The deal is a minor league contract with an invitation to Major League spring training. #EloyJimenez#Torontopic.twitter.com/YWcIiuaS0D\n\n— Mike Rodriguez (@mikedeportes) January 11, 2026\n\nMORE: Red Sox are paying Manny Ramirez same 2026 salary as Dodgers are paying Shohei Ohtani\n\nJimenez is still just 29 years old.\n\nHe was a top prospect for the Chicago White Sox, and as a rookie in 2019, he slugged 31 home runs in just 122 games.\n\nHe hit 14 homers in the COVID-shortened 2020 season, then 10 in just 55 games in an injury-plagued 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Jimenez played 84 games, hit 16 homers and batted .295.\n\nThe next season, it was 120 games with 18 homers and a .272 average.\n\nHe started his fall off in 2024. In 98 games, he hit just six homers and batted .238.\n\nJimenez didn't play in the majors at all in 2025.\n\nHe's not a sure thing, but he's not that far removed from being a prodigious power bat.\n\nIt's a low-risk signing for the Blue Jays, one that actually has upside. Not a bad move on a Sunday night for Toronto.\n\nTeam USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nHow Tigers, Tarik Skubal have reached a record-setting contract conflict\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nMLB looking at realignment into East-West arrangement\n\nHunter Pence's nephew has the best name and a 100 MPH fastball",

Fulks, who came in 13th in the country in assists at 6.6 per game, had 12 assists and six points.\n\nThe Bearcats had a chance to win, but Jalen Celestine's 3-pointer at the buzzer missed off the back iron.\n\nJamichael Stillwell added 15 points for the Knights (13-2, 2-1 Big 12), and backup big man Jeremy Foumena had 12 points and eight rebounds.\n\nMoustapha Thiam, who transferred from UCF to Cincinnati in the offseason, was booed on every touch and finished with a career-high 24 points on 10-of-15 shooting for the Bearcats (8-8, 0-3).

After the Knights went ahead 71-66 with 2:22 to play, Thiam responded with a hook shot and two free throws, and Miller's layup with 30 seconds left put the Bearcats ahead 72-71.\n\nCincinnati shot only 3 of 19 (15.8%) from 3-point range. UCF, meanwhile, shot 57.7% from the floor and 6 of 14 from 3.\n\nThe Bearcats kept it close thanks to their defense and rebounding.

    "fullText": "Dan Muse hasn’t reacted via lineup changes to losses very frequently this season, however today changes on that front. All three of the top lines are mixed up a bit, Anthony Mantha moves up to the top line, Ben Kindel and Tommy Novak join Justin Brazeau on a new-look line, and perhaps most inexplicably of all Kevin Hayes is going to center Evgeni Malkin and Yegor Chinakhov. It’s the type of lineup that works and Muse looks smart, or it doesn’t and a lot of people will be questioning. Connor Clifton is back for his first game since December 20th and only his second since 12/14 after a long streak of healthy scratches.\n\nToday's lineup in Boston.#LetsGoPens pic.twitter.com/jAYBMa1Rtf\n\n— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) January 11, 2026\n\nThe home Bruins are going with these lines and backup goalie Joonas Korpisalo on the back-half of their b2b.\n\nElias and Eyssimont are in. pic.twitter.com/G5blhYOL7e\n\n— Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) January 11, 2026\n\nTommy Novak goes to the box early. Boston appears to score later on but after further review Sean Kuraly punched the puck in with his glove and that isn’t allowed. No goal after all.\n\nBrazeau takes a penalty, Pittsburgh kills it off without much trouble. Soon after, the Bruins score a good goal. Viktor Arvidsson chops a backhander while not even facing the net after a scramble that slips under Stuart Skinner.\n\n7️⃣1️⃣ SNEAKS IT THROUGH pic.twitter.com/mUjw7e5IKi\n\n— Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) January 11, 2026\n\nThe period comes to a close much like it did throughout; with a Penguin in the penalty box. This time Evgeni Malkin for high-sticking. Pittsburgh again stays strong down a player.\n\nDecent first but the Pens were in penalty trouble too much and couldn’t get off to the start they were looking for. 1-0 Boston after one with an even 10 shots for each side.\n\nPittsburgh kills off the short carryover and gets a few looks at the Boston net but can’t beat Korpisalo. Kulak bobbles the puck and play goes the other way, Kulak has to hook Mark Kastelic to obstruct the breakaway and it’s yet another Penguin penalty to kill off, which they do.\n\nThe frequent trips to the penalty box continues, Kulak flipped the puck over the glass for the delay of game call with another job well done for the Pittsburgh PK.\n\nThe worm turns, Kastelic is given goalie interference penalty. Kastelic is none too pleased with Skinner for falling back in animated manner but given the situation it was bound to happen for the Penguins to finally get a shot with their power play for the first time on the night. It barely gets setup, though Brazeau does ring a deflected shot off the post shortly after the power play expires.\n\nBoth teams trade chances in the late stages, Sidney Crosby puts a couple of nice backhand shots that Korpisalo is right there to match.\n\nStill 1-0 Boston with Pittsburgh either getting in their own way or failing to get a lot going through 40 minutes.\n\nBrazeau is back to the penalty box early on, lucky for him the Bruins take a penalty 30 seconds into their power play to negate it.\n\nThe rest of the period trickles away without much going on. Pittsburgh pulls Skinner with about two minutes to go, they use the time with 1:24 remaining to regroup and give a breather. Doesn’t help and time ticks to 0:00 without the Pens finding a goal today.\n\nMalkin hasn’t taken any faceoffs in the three games he’s been back from his shoulder injury, noticed in this one that Hayes got kicked out of the circle by the linesman and Malkin didn’t react even a little to move a muscle and let Chinakhov take it instead. Might speak to the status of that shoulder right now for him to be completely out for taking draws.\n\nIt was a bad-good-bad situation with the Pittsburgh penalty kill today. The bad was taking five penalties in the first half of the game (to a curious 0 for the opponent). The good was the PK was very effective to only allow a handful of shots, very few of which were dangerous. The ultimate effect was bad to have 32% of the first 31 minutes of the game being spent as Boston power play time, making it impossible for the Pittsburgh skill players to get in a rhythm and get a lot going for themselves.\n\nThere’s a stat floating around social media with the Pens record with Hayes out of the record (something like 15-4-2) and with him in the lineup (now 6-10-7). Similar, but opposite to the record with Lizotte being very good, there’s some correlation issues there, but maybe not as many. Everyone likes Hayes who is a good guy and all, not sure why he needs to be on the ice with Malkin’s line. Many a person got hung up as Hayes as “second line center” this game, which was technically his placement but with only 10:19 of icetime Hayes was the player with the least amount of action today. The line is attached to doesn’t matter so much as the fact that if he’s in the lineup at all it’s creating a disadvantage for the Penguins.\n\nIt’s always startling how in the NHL there’s little difference between being in a groove turning into getting stuck in a rut. Last weekend at this time the Pens were coming off a win vs Detroit scoring four goals on Saturday and then a thrilling OT win against Columbus that produced five goals. Fast forward to this time, they score one against Calgary (hardly a defensive giant, and on their backup goal) and then have another backup goalie throw out a great performance today. Sometimes it do be like that with the highs and lows of a long season cresting and falling like waves in the ocean.\n\nThe bummer is that Boston didn’t have that much going on, just four shots in the second period and four \n\nThe Pens will head back home and try to shake off the doldrums they find themselves going through right now. They’ll likely need to do so soon since the mighty Tampa Bay Lightning are up next.",

Three of Illinois’ wins in conference play have come on the road — the Illini also won at Ohio State and Penn State.\n\nIllinois led 58-41 with 11:25 to play when the Hawkeyes (12-4, 2-3) began to rally. They got to within four points four times in the last two minutes of the game, including at 71-67 with 55 seconds left with a chance to cut the lead further, but Iowa’s Bennett Stirtz missed a layup.\n\nIowa made most of its run without Stirtz, its leading scorer this season at 18 points per game. Stirtz picked up his fourth foul with 11:36 to go and went to the bench for seven minutes. During that stretch the Hawkeyes outscored the Illini 18-10.\n\nTavion Banks led Iowa with 16 points. Tate Sage scored 13, Stirtz had 12 and Cooper Koch added 10.\n\nIllinois controlled all of the first half. The Illini led 8-0 after the first three minutes, getting open shots while Iowa was struggling at the other end of the court. The Hawkeyes had four missed shots and a turnover on their opening five possessions.\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Themus Fulks hit a jumper with 11 seconds left to give UCF a victory over Cincinnati.\n\nRiley Kugel scored 19 points for the Knights, who held on after blowing a five-point lead with 2:22 to play. Fulks, who came in 13th in the country in assists at 6.6 per game, had 12 assists and six points.\n\nThe Bearcats had a chance to win, but Jalen Celestine’s 3-pointer at the buzzer missed off the back iron.\n\nJamichael Stillwell added 15 points for the Knights (13-2, 2-1 Big 12), and backup big man Jeremy Foumena had 12 points and eight rebounds.\n\nMoustapha Thiam, who transferred from UCF to Cincinnati in the offseason, was booed on every touch and finished with a career-high 24 points on 10-of-15 shooting for the Bearcats (8-8, 0-3). Jizzle James added 14 points and Baba Miller had 13.\n\nThe game was tight throughout. UCF led 33-32 at halftime and its biggest second-half lead was six points. After the Knights went ahead 71-66 with 2:22 to play, Thiam responded with a hook shot and two free throws, and Miller’s layup with 30 seconds left put the Bearcats ahead 72-71.",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox will need to pivot if they want to add an impact bat now that Alex Bregman has reportedly agreed to a deal with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nMany experts predict that the Red Sox will now shift their focus to Bo Bichette, who they have reportedly been talking to as well. However, they could look to make a trade to fill their need for a bat.\n\nThe Red Sox have been active traders already this winter. However, they could suddenly match up with the Cubs for a trade after they stole Bregman from them. With the addition of Bregman to Chicago’s infield, they have an extra infielder.\n\nWith Bregman slotted in as the everyday third baseman, the Cubs face a decision with Nico Hoerner and Matt Shaw. Shaw made his debut last season and was one of the top prospects in the organization. He is under club control through 2031.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoerner has already been floated in trade rumors and is one year away from free agency. The Red Sox could use him to play second base, allowing Marcelo Mayer to play third base.\n\nHe was a Silver Slugger finalist last season and is a two-time Gold Glover at second base. He slashed .297/.345/.394 last season, but he could put up even better numbers at Fenway Park.\n\nHoerner would hit the open market after next season, but by then the hope would be that Kristian Campbell is ready to be the everyday second baseman, like the team hoped when they extended him last season.\n\nIt may seem odd to suggest the Red Sox trade with the team that just swiped their top free agent target. However, Craig Breslow has navigated the trade market well, and Hoerner is suddenly more available than ever.\n\nMLB Rumors: Why Red Sox’s Contract Offer Made Alex Bregman Uncomfortable",

    "fullText": "It’s been a great weekend for Will Stein and the Kentucky Wildcats. Stein was at the Wildcats’ game Saturday night when they came off the mats to beat Mississippi State 92-69 while also scoring several big football commitments.\n\nSunday, the Wildcats may have found their starting right tackle out of the transfer portal in UTEP offensive tackle Mark Robinson. KSR’s Jacob Polacheck broke the news first.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 320-pound Robinson is coming off his first season as a Miner after transferring to UTEP from Southeastern University following the 2024 season.\n\nRobinson has had a logical progression through the portal in his three seasons of college football, and now he will gear up for his first season in the SEC.\n\nThis year at UTEP, Robinson started all 12 regular-season games at left tackle for the Miners. He played a total of 813 snaps, finishing with a season grade of 54.9 per Pro Football Focus while being named an All-Conference USA honorable mention.\n\nIn 2024 with Southeastern, Robinson was named the Sun Conference Freshman of the Year and was second-team All-Sun Conference while starting all nine games at left tackle.\n\nRobinson will have two seasons of eligibility at Kentucky. While he primarily played left tackle, Robinson will be a candidate to move over to the right side and compete for the starting right tackle position, being that Tennessee left tackle Lance Heard also committed to the Wildcats this weekend and is a far more proven commodity at that blindside spot.\n\nAs of now, Robinson’s only competition at right tackle would be returning backup Malachi Wood, so Kentucky may look to add another tackle before it’s all said and done.",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA — Greetings from the press box at Lincoln Financial Field, where the Philadelphia Eagles will face the San Francisco 49ers in Sunday’s NFC Wild Card game.\n\nThe Eagles (11-6) and 49ers (12-5) will kick off at 4:40 p.m. The game between the NFC East champions and the NFC West squad will air nationally on FOX.\n\nIf they beat the 49ers on Sunday, the Eagles’ road to the Super Bowl will head to Soldier Field, where they’ll face the Chicago Bears in the NFC Divisional round.\n\nThe defending Super Bowl champs will have to take down San Francisco without one of their best players.\n\nOffensive tackle Lane Johnson is inactive despite optimism that he would be able to suit up against the 49ers. Johnson, the future Hall of Famer and five-time All-Pro, will now miss his eighth straight game with a Lisfranc foot injury suffered in Week 11.\n\nVeteran reserve Fred Johnson will start in his place at right tackle. The Eagles are 3-4 this season and 18-27 overall since 2013 without Lane Johnson in the lineup.\n\nStill, Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and the Eagles are 5.5-point betting favorites against San Francisco, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nOur prediction? Eagles win, 24-16.\n\nStay tuned for updates from the Linc throughout the game.\n\nJalen Hurts’ 4th down pass is incomplete to Goedert on 4th and 11 at the SF 21. Thrown into triple coverage. Ballgame, after Eagles blew one of their timeouts on 4th down.\n\nDallas Goedert keeps the season alive with 15-yard reception on 4th and 5. It came a play after a drop from AJ Brown over the middle.\n\nTouchdown 49ers. Christian McCaffrey on a 4-yard TD reception short middle from Brock Purdy to give Niners the lead again.\n\nDynamite drive behind McCaffrey, 10 plays over 66 yards taking up 5:06.\n\nIt’s Eddy Pineiro’s turn to miss PAT. He hooks it left and it’s a 4-point game.\n\nField goal Eagles. Jake Elliott hits from 33 yards and Eagles regain lead. Drive was 8 plays, 47 yards over 3:55.\n\nBarkley became the Eagles’ all-time leading rusher in playoff games, passing Brian Westbrook, during the drive.\n\nAnother franchise record for @saquon 😤 pic.twitter.com/vNcEREPQRe\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) January 12, 2026\n\nBarkley, who is over 100 yards rushing, comes up gingerly on 0-yard run. Eagles driving, 6 plays, 41 yards so far to the SF 21.\n\nInterception: Quinyon Mitchell INT again! The All-Pro undercuts a route and picks off Brock Purdy at the PHL 38. His second of the day.\n\nAn awful response from Philly. Penalty and two incompletions lead to 3 and out. 49ers take over at own 31 after 46-yard punt.\n\nTouchdown. San Fran opens fourth quarter with massive TD play. Brock Purdy pitches to Jauan Jennings on jet sweep but he drops to pass and delivers a beauty over the shoulder of Christian McCaffrey for a 29-yard score.\n\nThe play-calling skills disparity between Kyle Shanahan and Eagles OC Kevin Patullo is rearing its head.\n\nSF’s first lead since 6:10 of second quarter.\n\nThe missed extra point on Eagles’ opening score is the difference at the moment.\n\n49ers are driving to close the third quarter. Four plays for 38 yards, including Kyle Jusczcyk 27-yard reception, to reach the PHL 31.\n\nField goal, Eagles. Jake Elliott nails a 41-yard field goal to extend Eagles’ lead to 6 with a short field.\n\nStill a one-score game after Eagles didn’t do a ton even while taking over at SF 48. Not much aggression in the play-calling as Hurts ran a QB draw on 3rd and 13 for 4 yards to set up the field goal.\n\nThe Eagles’ defense is more than holding up its end of the bargain. Birds allow Niners just one yard while forcing a three-and-out. A terrible punt from Tom Morestead gives the Eagles the ball at the SF 46, just a 25-yard net.\n\nThe Eagles offense does nothing with Mitchell’s INT. It’s a three-and-out in part due to a holding penalty on Cam Jurgens on 2nd down.\n\nBoo birds were out ... and I don't blame them after running the ball on 2nd-and-18\n\n— Johnny McGonigal (@jmcgonigal9) January 11, 2026\n\nInterception for the Eagles. Quinyon Mitchell picks off Brock Purdy and Eagles take over at their own 48. It’s the first INT of the year for the All-Pro.\n\nEagles go 3-and-out to open second half. Braden Mann pins San Fran at the 5-yard line with his punt.\n\nIt was an eventful first half to say the least. The Eagles lead thanks to a havoc-creating defense, 71 rushing yards from Saquon Barkley and a pair of well-designed red-zone scores by Dallas Goedert.\n\nThe 49ers, meanwhile, will be without star tight end George Kittle, who was carted off the field and later ruled out with an Achilles injury.\n\nThe Eagles get the ball to start the second half.\n\nThe 49ers have cut into the Eagles’ lead with a 36-yard field goal. But the bigger news on that drive was the loss of George Kittle. The All-Pro tight end had to be carted off with what some are fearing is an Achilles injury.\n\nPrayers up for George Kittle 🙏 pic.twitter.com/BaRVd2sWwp\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 11, 2026\n\nKevin Patullo, take a bow. That was a well-designed drive by the Eagles’ embattled offensive coordinator. The Eagles marched on a 16-play, 94-yard TD drive, capped by a fourth-down, play-action pass to Dallas Goedert. It was Goedert’s second TD of the first half and his 13th of the season.\n\nPatullo mixed it up all drive, including a pass to DeVonta Smith out of the backfield and a nifty screen to Saquon Barkley, who put the San Francisco defense on skates. Good stuff from the Eagles as they take the lead.\n\nGuess who? pic.twitter.com/k3KTU8GYau\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) January 11, 2026\n\nThe Eagles answered San Francisco’s opening touchdown drive with one of their own. The Birds went 63 yards on 10 plays without a single negative play. Saquon Barkley got rolling with a 29-yard gain (and 45 yards total on six carries). The drive was capped by a jet sweep score for tight end Dallas Goedert. Kevin Patullo continues to call it right in the red zone. Jake Elliott missed his XP, though, so San Fran still leads.\n\nDALLAS GOEDERT RUSHING TD 🦅\n\nSFvsPHI on FOX/FOX One\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/mgdxVyxYuk\n\nWell, that’s a less than ideal start by the Birds’ defense. The 49ers score first with a six-play, 76-yard touchdown drive, thanks in large part to a 61-yard catch and run by Demarcus Robinson. The drive was capped on a two-yard scoring strike to Robinson, taking the energy right out of the Lincoln Financial Field crowd.\n\nOn both catches, Robinson burned All-Pro corner Quinyon Mitchell.

    "title": "Rapid Reaction: Northwestern loses another heartbreaker, falls 77-75 to Rutgers in overtime",
    "description": "How can this keep happening?",
    "fullText": "The Wildcats held a double-digit lead early, but were unable to hold on in a hair-pulling 77-75 overtime loss to Rutgers. Northwestern (8-8, 0-5 Big Ten) suffered its fourth loss of five or less points this season, while Rutgers (9-8, 2-4 Big Ten) squeaked out its second victory in Big Ten play.\n\nNick Martinelli led all scorers with a career-high 34 points. Arrinten Page contributed 14, and Jake West put together perhaps his best complete performance as a Wildcat, finishing with nine points, four assists, two rebounds and two blocks, despite missing a game-tying layup in the game’s final seconds.\n\nTariq Francis paced Rutgers with 30 points, with 23 coming in the second half and overtime. Darren Buchanan Jr. had 14 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nNorthwestern relied on four three pointers in the first half to take a double-digit lead. However, they would make just two more threes the rest of the game, leaning heavily upon production inside from Martinelli and Page. While neither team shot exceptionally well from the field — with Northwestern at 41.3% and Rutgers 40.6% — the Scarlet Knights had a little bit more grit through 40 minutes, out-rebounding the ‘Cats 47-40 and making two more free throws, despite having two less attempts at the line.\n\nOut of the gate, head coach Chris Collins chose to roll with a Reid-Clayton-Mullins-Martinelli-Singleton starting lineup. Angelo Ciaravino and Arrinten Page, who have started 12 and 13 games, respectively, for the ‘Cats this season, came off the bench for a second straight game.\n\nJayden Reid opened the scoring with a jumpshot after Jamichael Davis missed two free throws for the Scarlet Knights on their opening possession.\n\nOver the next three minutes, Nick Martinelli poured in a quick nine points, pushing the ‘Cats out to an 11-4 lead. Martinelli, on average, makes just 1.3 three pointers per game, but knocked down two big triples in the opening minutes to give the ‘Cats a hot start in this one.\n\n.@N_Martinelli1 from deep‼️ pic.twitter.com/oTxq7LM60i\n\n— Northwestern Basketball (@NUMensBball) January 11, 2026\n\nOut of a media timeout, Darren Buchanan Jr. connected on a three for Rutgers, but the ‘Cats continued to roll on the offensive end. Northwestern rattled off a 10-2 run off the back of two Jake West three-point jumpers, pushing its lead to 23-11.\n\nThrough the game’s opening ten minutes, the ‘Cats shot 4-for-7 (57.1%) from outside, well above their 30.8% average on the season and their 25.0% clip in the last six games. Martinelli and West’s early threes not only mathematically accelerated Northwestern’s scoring, but more generally opened up space on the floor, allowing for a more fluid offensive operation.\n\nFollowing the ‘Cats’ early run, Rutgers was able to pick up its scoring, pouring in seven points in just two minutes. However, two inside buckets for Arrinten Page, who scored six points in the first half, protected the ‘Cats’ sizable lead.\n\nScoring slowed down for both teams the next several possessions, as the ‘Cats suffered a scoring drought that spanned almost three minutes. Though a strong defensive effort continued to limit Rutgers’ offense, two Christoph Nwuli free throws and a Lino Mark layup allowed the Scarlet Knights to tighten the game to a 27-22 score.\n\nThe teams traded points over the course of a few possessions, but it was Rutgers who went on the next scoring run, finishing the half 10-2 to enter the half down just two points. Shooting just 20% from outside, the Scarlet Knights moved to attack the basket, scoring six of their ten points at the foul line and their other four in the paint.\n\nThough Northwestern led 35-33 at the half, it was a disappointing final ten minutes for the visitors after the 12-point lead they built in the early minutes after a hot start from the perimeter. Martinelli’s 15 points led all scorers, while Buchanan’s ten points led the Scarlet Knights. Neither team found much success scoring in the paint, as the ‘Cats relied on four early three-point buckets for their offensive production, and Rutgers leaned on its nine points from the charity stripe. Though Northwestern was able to shoot 48.3% from the field and 40% on threes, the ‘Cats went 3-for-8 from the free throw line, leaving a few points on the board.\n\nRutgers and Northwestern traded buckets to start the second half, with the Scarlet Knights knocking down three jumpshots—including one three-pointer—and Martinelli building off of his strong first half for the ‘Cats, converting upon two free throws and an inside layup.\n\nAt the 15:36 mark, Rutgers took its first lead of the game when Emmanuel Ogbole slammed home a dunk. Outside of West’s two early three-pointers, the Scarlet Knights’ guards won their defensive assignments against their Northwestern counterparts. With the score 49-47, 35 of Northwestern’s 49 points had come from bigs Martinelli (21), Page (10) and Singleton (4), who kept the ‘Cats in the game in the early part of the second half.\n\nWest’s third three of the game briefly extended a Northwestern scoring run to 7-0. The home team was quick to respond, however, as Tariq Francis connected on two jumpshots to bring the Northwestern lead to 54-52 with 7:37 remaining.\n\nOn Northwestern’s next two-possessions, it continued to apply pressure with its big men, as Martinelli and Page found their way to the charity stripe, each making a pair of free throws. After shooting 37.5% from the free throw line in the first half, Northwestern was much improved in the second half, shooting  10-for-12 (83.3%).\n\nMartinelli was especially involved at the free throw line in the second half, shooting a perfect 8-for-8. Four of those free throws contributed to Martinelli scoring the Wildcats’ last six points, giving Northwestern a 62-56 lead with just four minutes remaining.\n\nFollowing Martinelli’s run, five points from Rutgers’ Jamichael Davis contributed to a swift 9-3 response, cutting Northwestern’s lead to just one point with slightly over a minute to play.\n\nOut of a timeout, Collins was intent on getting Martinelli involved in the action. However, he was swarmed in the post by the Scarlet Knights and unable to get a quality shot, giving Rutgers a chance to take the lead.\n\nOn the other end, Tariq Francis was fouled on a jumpshot by West. At the line, Francis converted on two free throws, giving Rutgers a one-point lead at 0:39. Francis, the Scarlet Knights’ leading scorer this season, came alive in the second half, scoring 16 of Rutgers’ 34 points.\n\nBacks against the wall, Collins continued to put the ball in the hands of the Big Ten’s leading scorer. Unlike the previous possession, it paid off, as the Glenview native connected on a silky jumper from the left wing to put the ‘Cats back in front.\n\nWith 26 seconds remaining, it seemed the ‘Cats just needed one more stop to seal this one in Piscataway. Rather, Rutgers recovered possession of the ball after two missed Francis jumpshots, forcing the ‘Cats to defend three separate shot attempts. On the third, a putback layup by Buchanan, Jordan Clayton committed a shooting foul. However, Buchanan, a 59.0% season free throw shooter, made just one of two at the line, deadlocking the game at 67 as time expired in regulation.\n\nOvertime would be needed to decide this one, as a fired up Martinelli, who scored 31 points in regulation for Northwestern, screamed to encourage the ‘Cats to keep fighting for five more minutes.\n\nAnd, it would be Martinelli who started the scoring in the overtime period. However, Rutgers would respond with a 7-3 scoring run, led by five more points from a red hot Francis. The Scarlet Knights led  76-72 with 1:22 to play in the period.\n\nOn the subsequent possession, Tre Singleton hit iron on a three-point attempt giving the ball back to Rutgers. With another basket bound to decide the game, Page kept the Wildcats alive, blocking Francis’ shot on defense, and then drawing a shooting foul with a hard drive to the basket on offense. Page knocked down both free throws, putting the score at 76-74.\n\nWith 30 seconds to play and the shot clock turned off, Northwestern applied a full court press, forcing them to take a timeout after trapping them in the right corner. After the timeout, the ‘Cats stole the inbounds pass, gaining a chance to tie or take the lead in the game’s final seconds.\n\nDespite a special 34-point performance, Martinelli wasn’t able to save the day for the ‘Cats. Initially, he missed a tough left-handed layup, though the ‘Cats were able to force a jump ball and retain possession on the rebound. On the following possession, Martinelli was fouled and sent to the line, but he missed the second of his two free throws; the ‘Cats still trailed 76-75.\n\nWith just nine seconds remaining, Rutgers inbounded the ball to Buchanan and Northwestern immediately fouled him, sending the junior guard back to the line for more clutch free throws. Once again, Buchanan split his free throws, giving Northwestern a chance to tie the game in the final moments. West dribbled the ball the full length of the floor, but Buchanan recovered from his miss and blocked his shot at the rim, securing a 77-75 victory for the Scarlet Knights in the game’s final moments.\n\nAfter leading by 12 points in the early going, Northwestern was unable to ride Martinelli’s 34 points to victory, suffering its fifth straight loss to open Big Ten play. Heartbreak for the ‘Cats on the road in New Jersey.",

The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle and starting safety Ji’Ayir Brown but still managed to take care of business on both sides of the ball. It wasn’t pretty, but the 49ers are headed to the Divisional Round. The Eagles took a lead into the fourth quarter when the 49ers took their first lead on a trick play touchdown pass from Jauan Jennings to Christian McCaffrey.

Here's how the draft order looks after the start of the playoffs:\n\n13. Falcons (traded first-round pick to Rams)\n\n16. Colts (traded first-round pick to Jets)\n\n20. Packers (traded first-round pick to Cowboys)\n\n24. Jaguars (traded first-round pick to Browns)\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders earned the first overall pick by having with the easiest schedule of the four teams that finished tied with the worst record in the NFL, 3-14.\n\nDraft picks are awarded in order of lowest winning percentage, and the tiebreaker is opponents’ winning percentage, with the team that played the easiest schedule picking first. If two teams have the same record and same strength of schedule, division or conference tiebreakers are applied. If the divisional or conference tiebreakers are not applicable, or ties still exist between teams of different conferences, ties will be broken the following tie-breaking method:\n\nBest won-lost-tied percentage in common games (minimum of four)\n\nStrength of victory in all games\n\nBest combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed in all games\n\nBest net touchdowns in all games\n\nThe 18 non-playoff teams get the first 18 picks. The six wild card round playoff losers get picks 19-24, the four divisional round losers get picks 25-28, the conference championship game losers get picks 29 and 30, the Super Bowl loser gets pick 31 and the Super Bowl winner gets pick 32.\n\nThe 2026 NFL draft takes place April 23-25 in Pittsburgh. The first round will be on Thursday night, the second and third rounds will be on Friday night, and the fourth through seventh rounds will be on Saturday.\n\nIndiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is the betting favorite to go first overall.

    "fullText": "The Seahawks now know whom they are going to play to begin their playoffs. It’s an old, despised rival. In a rematch from a recent showdown.\n\nSixth-seed San Francisco rallied from a deficit at halftime at Philadelphia Sunday to beat the third-seeded Eagles. The win over the defending Super Bowl champions makes the 49ers the lowest remaining seed in the NFC to win on wild-card weekend.\n\nThat means the 49ers (13-5) will play at top-seeded Seattle (14-3) in a showdown of NFC West rivals next weekend at Lumen Field in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs.\n\nOdds and precedence say that game is most likely going to be next Saturday, Jan. 17, either at 1:30 p.m. or 5 p.m.\n\nThe NFC’s top seed has played on the Saturday of the divisional round every playoffs since the end of the 2019 season. Including the AFC, at least one of the two conference seeds have played on that Saturday in round two every year since the 2016 season.\n\nThe league likes to reward the number-one seeds with the advantage of an extra day of rest and preparation should they win in divisional round to each of the conference championship games. Those are on the following Sunday, Jan. 25. The Rams will play the Bears in Chicago in the other NFC divisional game.\n\nSeattle split its two division games against San Francisco this season.\n\nIn week one in September, the 49ers led 17-13 late in the game when Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold lost a fumble near the San Francisco 10-yard line in the final seconds of the game to ensure the Niners’ seventh victory in eight games against the Seahawks.\n\nIn week 18 Jan. 3 in Santa Clara, California, coach Mike Macdonald’s Seahawks defense dominated Kyle Shanahan’s offense in the NFC West title game. Seattle held San Francisco to 127 yards in a 13-3 win. It was the 49ers’ fewest points in a game in nine years.\n\nThis is Seattle’s first time with a wild-card playoff bye and top seed since January 2015, at the end of its last Super Bowl season.\n\nAfter two practices this week and this weekend off, Seahawks veteran wide receiver Cooper Kupp said the Seahawks have a we-aren’t-satisfied attitude heading into the divisional round.\n\n“We’re still under construction. We’re still working towards something,” Kupp said. “The attitude and the effort for the last couple of days, the focus that was in this room out in the walk-throughs and out there on the practice field speaks about the guys that we have here.\n\n“Everyone is excited about this opportunity. We’re going to take these next few days and recover and come back ready to go.”",

    "description": "Here's a look at the offseason work ahead for the Philadelphia Eagles.",
    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has begun, and Yahoo Sports is previewing the coming months for all 32 teams, from free agency through the draft and more.\n\nAFC East: Bills | Dolphins | Patriots | Jets\nAFC North: Ravens | Bengals | Browns | Steelers \nAFC South: Texans | Colts | Jaguars | Titans \nAFC West: Broncos | Chiefs | Raiders | Chargers \nNFC East: Cowboys | Giants | Eagles | Commanders \nNFC North: Bears | Lions | Packers | Vikings \nNFC South: Falcons | Panthers | Saints | Buccaneers \nNFC West: Cardinals | Rams | 49ers | Seahawks\n\n2025 season record: 11-6 (u 11.5 wins), first in NFC East, lost to 49ers in wild-card round, 13th in DVOA\n\nThis was not the world-beating team so many expected to see after last year’s Super Bowl title. Last season. Philadelphia battled with some inconsistency in the offense but found a groove by the end of the season. The 2025 version never fully got it.\n\nHow the Eagles played in games was telling. In 2024, they were 24th in points per drive on their opening possession, but improved to fifth over the rest of the game. The 2025 Eagles were sixth in points per drive on their opening possession, but dropped to 25th on all following drives. The 2024 Eagles figured it out, while the 2025 version couldn’t adapt. Offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo might take the fall for that, failing to replicate the work Kellen Moore did previously.\n\nThe talent is still overwhelming. That was the case with a defense that was still second in EPA per play while developing multiple All-Pro-caliber players. But, also as the defense proved, this team needs to figure out how to make that talent work together instead of just relying on the talent to carry itself.\n\nThe Eagles have just over $14 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap. That ranks 16th. They’re fairly locked into this roster. Because of how the Eagles have structured their contracts, there’s not a lot of restructure potential — most contracts are pre-restuctured with small base salaries and option bonuses. If the Eagles re-sign Dallas Goedert early, they could create space by shrinking the $20.5 million figure that would hit the cap when his contract voids on Feb. 16.\n\nTE Dallas Goedert \nEdge Jaelan Phillips \nLB Nakobe Dean \nS Reed Blankenship\n\nGoedert led the team and was ninth in the league with a 27.8% target share in the red zone. His 10 red zone touchdowns were second only to Davante Adams. Jaelan Phillips was a defense-changer after the trade that brought him to Philadelphia. From Weeks 1-9, the Eagles were 14th in pressure rate. After Phillips was acquired, they ranked fifth. Dean has been excellent and was immediately put back into the starting lineup when he returned from injury, but the presence of Jihaad Campbell and the high rate of nickel defense will likely make Dean expendable in free agency.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are two of the best players at their positions, but the second outside cornerback spot was a hole all season. Adoree’ Jackson was one of the most targeted cornerbacks on a per-snap basis and the Eagles ranked 24th in DVOA against WR2s.\n\nEven if Goedert is re-signed, the Eagles should add a tight end to the mix. Grant Calcaterra was a negative as a blocker and did not make up for it enough as a receiver — though the Eagles were fifth in EPA per play from 12 personnel, which they ran at the 12th-highest rate in the league.\n\nDepth on the edge will need to be addressed. That was the reason for the Phillips trade and bringing Brandon Graham out of retirement. Neither of them is under contract for 2026.\n\n1st round \n2nd round \n3rd round \n3rd round (projected compensatory) \n4th round \n4th round (projected compensatory) \n5th round (ATL) \n5th round (projected compensatory)\n6th round\n\nThe Eagles have built their dominance through the trenches, and now they find Lane Johnson’s long-term replacement. Lomu moves well for his size, and has polished technique and can add even more weight and strength. He can learn behind Jeff Stoutland and the All-Pros they have along the line before taking over himself.\n\nThe Eagles went 10-7 against the spread in the 2025-26 regular season, but were only 8-7 ATS as a favorite. They were also a surprisingly poor 4-4 ATS at home. — Ben Fawkes",

    "fullText": "It's been a busy day for the Oregon Ducks when it comes to breaking news, with several players announcing their transfers, and a couple announcing NFL decisions as well.\n\nThe latest player to announce his intention to enter the transfer portal is defensive end Ashton Porter, a redshirt sophomore who was a solid contributor for the defense this year. Porter, a former member of the 2024 class, played in all 15 games for the Ducks this year, recording 20 tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss, and one sack. In his career, he has 25 tackles, three TFLs, and 1.5 sacks.\n\nPorter now becomes the third defensive lineman to announce his transfer on Sunday, joining both Blake Purchase and Xadavien Sims.\n\nBREAKING: Oregon EDGE Ashton Porter is entering the @TransferPortal, he tells @On3sports\n\nThe 6’4 275 EDGE totaled 20 tackles, 1 sack, and 1 PD this season\n\nHe’ll have 2 years of eligibility left https://t.co/RlUbB6EMhS pic.twitter.com/7C7Y4iywRM\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 12, 2026\n\nMuch like Blake Purchase's transfer foreshadowed the announcements from Matayo Uiagalelei and Teitum Tuioti, both of whom are returning to Oregon for the 2026 season, you could argue that this move from Porter, along with the transfer from Sims, might indicate some forthcoming news on the defensive line.\n\nMight A'Mauri Washington be coming back for the 2026 season?\n\nNothing has been announced yet, but that is something to watch in the next few hours and days.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Oregon Ducks defensive end Ashton Porter announces transfer",

Following a crazy back-and-forth game between the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers, it’s now set: the Rams will visit the Chicago Bears next weekend.\n\nThe date and time of the game are not yet determined, but the Rams will be on the road for the second straight week. Elsewhere in the NFC, the 49ers will visit the Seahawks in the divisional round.\n\nThe Bears are the only team left in the playoffs that the Rams haven't faced this season, so this will be a new opponent for them. The Bears won a thriller over the Packers on Saturday night, 31-27, coming back from trailing 21-3 to win by four points. They scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to knock out the Packers.\n\nThe Bears won the NFC North and earned the No. 2 seed in the conference after an 11-6 season, all despite losing their last two regular-season games.\n\nThe Rams took down the Carolina Panthers in the wild-card round, 34-31, in what was a thrilling game that went down to the wire. Matthew Stafford threw the game-winner to Colby Parkinson from 19 yards out with just 38 seconds left on the clock, keeping the Rams' season alive.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: NFC playoffs: Rams will face Bears in divisional round",

They beat the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday of Week 18 to clinch the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoff bracket.\n\nThe No. 1 seed comes with a first round bye, which will give Seattle time to rest and get some players back from the injury list. In their finale against the 49ers, they played without left tackle Charles Cross and free safety Coby Bryant. They got the win and it netted an extra week for Cross and Bryant to get healthy.\n\nSunday result: The 49ers upset the Eagles in Philadelphia to close out the NFC Wild Card Round. The Seahawks will host the 49ers in the Divisional Round.\n\nSaturday Packers-Bears result: The Bears advanced to the Divisional Round with a huge comeback win over the Packers. Green Bay jumped out to a 21-3 lead, but managed to blow it in the fourth quarter. Chicago scored 25 points in the fourth quarter en route to a 31-27 victory. The win means we’ll have to wait until Sunday to finalize the NFC Divisional Round bracket. If the Eagles beat the 49ers, Seattle will host LA and Chicago will host Philly. If the 49ers upset the Eagles, Seattle would host San Francisco and Chicago would host LA.\n\nSaturday Rams-Panthers update: The Rams won a wild one over the Panthers to open the 2026 NFL Playoffs. It does not tell us much more about the Seahawks Divisional Round opponent other than to eliminate the Panthers from the list.\n\nThe NFL re-seeds its bracket after the Wild Card round. That means the Seahawks will face the worst remaining seed rather than knowing it will be one of two teams. If all the higher seeds win in the Wild Card round, Seattle would play the No. 4 seeded Carolina Panthers. If all the lower seeds create upsets, Seattle would play the No. 7 seeded Green Bay Packers. It could fall anywhere in between depending on how the higher seeds perform, with the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams also in the mix as potential opponents. The Seahawks could know their Divisional Round opponent as soon as Saturday night if the Packers upset the Bears. Otherwise, they’ll find out their opponent by the close of the 49ers-Eagles game on Sunday.\n\nRecord: 31-23 regular season, 1-1 postseason all-time\n\nThe teams split their regular season series, with each team winning the road game. The Seahawks won the Week 18 finale to clinch the NFC West and the No. 1 seed. The last time they faced off in the playoffs was 2023, with the 49ers winning 41-23.\n\n49ers @ Seahawks\nSpread: Seahawks -7\nTotal: 46.5\nMoneyline: Seahawks -330, 49ers +265\n\nThe Seahawks return to the playoffs after a two-season absence. They lost in the Wild Card round in 2022, and lost in the same round two seasons prior. The last time they played in the Divisional Round was 2019, where they won a wild card game and then lost to the Packers.\n\nThis marks the fourth time the Seahawks have earned the No. 1 seed. The previous instances were in 2005, 2013, and 2014. They reached the Super Bowl in all three of those seasons, and won it in 2013.",

As far as the players that are coming in, you will become us and do things the way that we do things.\"\n\nSafeties Brandyn Hillman, Jordan Young, and TJ Metcalf, along with cornerback Jayden Sanders, ended up joining Elijah Dotson and Jaden Mangham, departing the program. Cornerback Zeke Berry had left, but withdrew from the transfer portal, and there are indications that some who are in the portal who may come back. But you know who never left? Cornerback Jyaire Hill.\n\nAnd, as it turns out, he doesn't intend on leaving, having posted to his Instagram that he will be back with the Wolverines in 2026.\n\nDB Jyaire Hill is the latest member of Michigan’s ‘LFG147’ campaign, signaling a planned return in 2026. pic.twitter.com/t73vxbQkTC\n\n— Aaron McMann | MLive.com (@AaronMcMann) January 11, 2026\n\nWith Hill returning, both of Michigan's starting cornerbacks return, along with Shamari Earls and Jo'Ziah Edmond. The Wolverines did lose a cornerback who had initially signed in the 2026 class in Richmond (Va.) Hermitage four-star Andre Clarke, but still retain Waco (Tx.) Connally four-star Jamarion Vincent.\n\nMichigan hosted Utah transfer cornerback Smith Snowden but he has continued to take visits and hasn't made a decision as of yet.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: Jyaire Hill stays at Michigan as DB room sees transfer portal exits",

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have struggled to find explosive plays this season. Brock Purdy found Demarcus Robinson, who beat Quinyon Mitchell of all people, for a 61-yard catch and run. Two plays later, Purdy lofted a pass into the hands of Christian McCaffrey for an 11-yard gain.\n\nThe drive ended how it began, with a reception by Robinson, who beat Mitchell once more for a touchdown to give the 49ers an early 7-0 lead.\n\nThe Eagles took advantage of Deommodore Lenoir’s overaggressiveness right away. Lenoir jumped inside, allowing Saquon Barkley to rush untouched down the sideline for 29 yards. Lenoir then gave up a first-down reception to A.J. Brown. On 3rd & 3, Barkley looked to be stopped initially, but managed to pick up a first down.\n\nThe Eagles had converted a league-high 70 percent of their red zone trips into touchdowns. Garret Wallow and Ji’Ayir Brown were unblocked on two separate plays, but couldn’t tackle Barkley. A jet sweep to Dallas Goedert brought the Eagles within one, but Jake Elliott’s missed extra point meant the 49ers still had a 7-6 lead.\n\nThe 49ers isolated Kittle on Mitchell on their second drive, but Mitchell won this battle. Purdy was late on a third-down throw to Robinson, after it appeared he was impacted by some pressure after Trent Williams got beaten, and the Niners went three-and-out. Thomas Morstead’s punt only went 35 yards.\n\nWorry set in, under the impression that the defense wouldn’t be able to get many stops. Eric Kendricks came up with one on first down. Garret Wallow had one on second down. But Lenoir was beaten once again on third down, giving the Eagles another first down. Lenoir got his wish to travel with the wide receivers. He followed A.J. Brown, but Brown won once again for eight yards.\n\nSam Okuayinonu made a stop on 3rd & 2. The 49ers have been excellent all season in short-yardage situations. But they were going against a team that uses all four downs. The Eagles were 0 for seven on their previous fourth-down attempts. Upton Stout undercut DeVonta Smith’s route, making Philly 0-for-8.\n\nThe 49ers had prime field position, but couldn’t muster anything. Jauan Jennings didn’t stand a chance against Cooper DeJean, and nobody could get open on a third-down scramble by Purdy, leading to a quick three-and-out. Jennings’ second down target was technically a drop.\n\nLetting the Eagles off the hook after a turnover in that spot was always going to come back to bite the Niners. It was just a matter of when.\n\nMorstead’s punt pinned the Eagles at the six-yard line. That did not matter, as the Eagles gained 7, 7, 9, and 5 yards to begin the drive. After a first down incompletion and a Ji’Ayir Brown tackle near the line of scrimmage, the 49ers forced a 3rd & 10. A false start made it 3rd-and-15.\n\nNo pressure allowed DeVonta Smith to gain 14 yards, and we knew what was next. Jalen Hurts tush-pushed his way for a first down—another backbreaker. Barkley gained 20 on a screen. Tank Bigsby ran into the red zone and eventually down to the 10-yard line.\n\nThe front-7 couldn’t do anything to stop the Eagles’ running game, which averaged nearly six yards per carry and had almost 100 yards midway through the second quarter. A Kendricks tackle for loss forced a 3rd & 5. On 4th & 2, Malik Mustapha was beaten in coverage for a touchdown. There was a flag picked up, and the Eagles took a 13-7 lead.\n\nJi’Ayir Brown limped off the field and was questionable to return with a hamstring injury.\n\nThe 49ers lost George Kittle to an apparent Achilles injury on the first play of their next drive. Jauan Jennings answered with a 45-yard reception. McCaffrey slipped on 3rd & 1, and Shanahan elected for points. Eddy Pineiro’s field goal was good, bringing the score to 13-10.\n\nThe 49ers’ defense needed to come up with a stop. Rookie Marques Sigle made a tackle on first down, then was able to sprint back and help Lenoir break up a deep pass, finally, on third and long. Renardo Green forced an incompletion against A.J. Brown to force a punt.\n\nAfter being sacked, Robinson beat Adoree Jackson on a comeback route for a first down. Not only did that allow the 49ers to continue to possess the ball and keep it away from the Eagles, but it also gave them an opportunity to kick a field goal.\n\nUnfortunately, Pinerio wouldn’t get that chance. Malik Turner and Kendrick Bourne couldn’t get lined up pre-snap, forcing the offense to burn its final timeout. Shanahan called a creative play before the half, but Purdy fumbled, and that ran the clock to 0.\n\nAt the half, Purdy had a passing success rate of 47 percent, compared to 50 percent from Hurts. However, Purdy had a higher EPA per dropback at .42 than Hurts at .22. The defense against a turnover was the difference in the first half, not to mention not scoring at the end of it.\n\nThe 49ers’ defense forced a three-and-out. But Skyy Moore did not do them any favors after fielding a punt at the five-yard line. The offense got a little help after Jauan Jennings drew a personal foul. Robinson beat Jackson once more for a 14-yard gain. He was the only reliable wideout and still continued to come through.\n\nBut Purdy’s next attempt would be costly. He was late when targeting Skyy Moore, who was being defended by Quinyon Mitchell. The pass was a floater, and Mitchell easily intercepted the pass, stalling a 49ers game-tying drive.\n\nA holding call put the Eagles behind the sticks. On 3rd & 19, the defense got off the field. That was the third three-and-out in a row the 49ers forced. Not allowing points off a turnover was huge in that spot by the defense.\n\nThe offense couldn’t muster anything on its next drive. McCaffrey ran for one yard, then a third-down attempt by McCaffrey was high, forcing a punt. Morstead’s 25-yard punt gave the Eagles the ball around midfield.\n\nCJ West kicked off the drive with a tackle for loss. Kendricks had another tackle for loss. Sigle made an impressive open-field tackle, but the Eagles continued to convert on third downs. Bryce Huff made the third tackle for loss on the drive. The 49ers forced a field goal attempt from 41 yards out. This time, Jake Elliott’s kick was good to make it 16-10.\n\nKyle Juszczyk was wide open to begin the next drive. He did more damage after the catch before finally being tackled after 27 yards. Heading into the 4th quarter, the 49ers were knocking on the door of the red zone.\n\nThe 49ers had the wind at their backs in the fourth quarter. Shanahan called a trick play where Jauan Jennings threw it to Christian McCaffrey. The play did not disappoint:\n\nThe call. The throw. The catch. Cinema. pic.twitter.com/Ib6dsjhUtp\n\n— Niners Nation (@NinersNation) January 12, 2026\n\nPer Next Gen Stats, that was the deepest touchdown reception by air yards of McCaffrey’s career.\n\nThe defense did its part on the ensuing drive by forcing a punt. Keion White won on third down. The offense still needed to find a way to add points.\n\nJuszczyk kicked things off with a first-down reception. But Purdy’s pass to Jake Tonges was late once more. The ball floated, and Mitchell had another interception. It was an inopportune time for a bad decision.\n\nThe first penalty of the game for the 49ers didn’t come at a good time, either. Marques Sigle was flagged for a late hit while Hurts was sliding, putting the ball into field goal range. Elliott’s 33-yard attempt split the uprights to give the Eagles a 19-17 lead.\n\nRobinson went over 100 yards with his next reception to put the 49ers in Eagles territory. It was a gain of 16 yards. Shanahan called one of his timely screens, and McCaffrey picked up another chunk play. Tonges drew a holding penalty, negating a Purdy sack to give the offense a first down.\n\nJuszczyk made a fantastic catch on a throw that was behind him. Jennings had an opportunity to catch a touchdown on 2nd & goal, but couldn’t haul in the pass. On 3rd & goal, Purdy bought time before finding McCaffrey in the end zone to give the Niners a 23-19 lead after Pineiro missed the point after attempt.\n\nOn 3rd & 5, Brown had a couple of steps on Lenoir, but he could not hold onto the ball. The Eagles went for it on 4th & 5 and converted after Goedert beat Mustapha. DeVonta Smith had a pair of first-down receptions to put the Eagles on the brink of the red zone. But Smith dropped a 3rd & 11, which meant the game would come down to a 4th & 11.\n\nEric Kendricks got into the throwing lane to nearly intercept the pass. It was a remarkable game with plenty of ebbs and flows, but the 49ers prevailed.\n\nThe 49ers ended up outgaining the Eagles, who only went 5-for-16 on third downs. Props to Robert Saleh and the defense for holding the Eagles to 19 points and turning them over twice. Brock Purdy turned it over twice but drove the offense for the game-winning drive.",

    "fullText": "The Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine (sometimes called the Machine Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine or MENACE) was a mechanical computer made from 304 matchboxes designed and built by artificial intelligence researcher Donald Michie and his colleague Roger Chambers, in 1961. It was designed to play human opponents in games of noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe) by returning a move for any given state of play and to refine its strategy through reinforcement learning. This was one of the first types of artificial intelligence.\n\nMichie and Chambers did not have immediate access to a computer; they worked around this by building the engine out of matchboxes.[1] The matchboxes they used each represented a single possible layout of a noughts and crosses grid. When the computer first played, it would randomly choose moves based on the current layout. As it played more games, through a reinforcement loop, it disqualified strategies that led to losing games, and supplemented strategies that led to winning games. Michie held a tournament against MENACE in 1961, wherein he experimented with different openings.\n\nFollowing MENACE's maiden tournament against Michie, it demonstrated successful artificial intelligence in its strategy. Michie's essays on MENACE's weight initialisation and the BOXES algorithm used by MENACE became popular in the field of computer science research. Michie was honoured for his contribution to machine learning research, and was twice commissioned to program a MENACE simulation on an actual computer.\n\nDonald Michie (1923–2007) had been on the team decrypting the German Tunny Code during World War II.[2] Fifteen years later, he wanted to further display his mathematical and computational prowess with an early convolutional neural network. Since computer equipment was not obtainable for such uses,[3] and Michie did not have a computer readily available,[3] he decided to display and demonstrate artificial intelligence in a more esoteric format and constructed a functional mechanical computer out of matchboxes and beads.[4][5]\n\nMENACE was constructed as the result of a bet with a computer science colleague who postulated that such a machine was impossible.[6] Michie undertook the task of collecting and defining each matchbox as a \"fun project\", later turned into a demonstration tool.[1] Michie completed his essay on MENACE in 1963,[5] \"Experiments on the mechanization of game-learning\", as well as his essay on the BOXES Algorithm, written with R. A. Chambers[1] and had built up an AI research unit in Hope Park Square, Edinburgh, Scotland.[7]\n\nMENACE learned by playing successive matches of noughts and crosses. Each time, it would eliminate a losing strategy by the human player confiscating the beads that corresponded to each move.[5] It reinforced winning strategies by making the moves more likely, by supplying extra beads.[8] This was one of the earliest versions of the Reinforcement Loop, the schematic algorithm of looping the algorithm, dropping unsuccessful strategies until only the winning ones remain.[5] This model starts as completely random, and gradually learns.[9]\n\nMENACE was made from 304 matchboxes glued together in an arrangement similar to a chest of drawers.[10] Each box had a code number, which was keyed into a chart. This chart had drawings of tic-tac-toe game grids with various configurations of X, O, and empty squares,[5] corresponding to all possible permutations a game could go through as it progressed.[11] After removing duplicate arrangements (ones that were simply rotations or mirror images of other configurations), MENACE used 304 permutations in its chart and thus that many matchboxes.[12]\n\nEach individual matchbox tray contained a collection of coloured beads.[13] Each colour represented a move on a square on the game grid, and so matchboxes with arrangements where positions on the grid were already taken would not have beads for that position. Additionally, at the front of the tray were two extra pieces of card in a \"V\" shape,[10] the point of the \"V\" pointing at the front of the matchbox.[11] Michie and his artificial intelligence team called MENACE's algorithm \"Boxes\",[7] after the apparatus used for the machine. The first stage \"Boxes\" operated in five phases, each setting a definition and a precedent for the rules of the algorithm in relation to the game.[14]\n\nMENACE played first, as O, since all matchboxes represented permutations only relevant to the \"X\" player.[12][17] To retrieve MENACE's choice of move, the opponent or operator located the matchbox that matched the current game state, or a rotation or mirror image of it. For example, at the start of a game, this would be the matchbox for an empty grid. The tray would be removed and lightly shaken so as to move the beads around.[5] Then, the bead that had rolled into the point of the \"V\" shape at the front of the tray was the move MENACE had chosen to make.[5] Its colour was then used as the position to play on, and, after accounting for any rotations or flips needed based on the chosen matchbox configuration's relation to the current grid, the O would be placed on that square. Then the player performed their move, the new state was located, a new move selected, and so on, until the game was finished.[12]\n\nWhen the game had finished, the human player observed the game's outcome. As a game was played, each matchbox that was used for MENACE's turn had its tray returned to it ajar, and the bead used kept aside, so that MENACE's choice of moves and the game states they belonged to were recorded. Michie described his reinforcement system with \"reward\" and \"punishment\". Once the game was finished, if MENACE had won, it would then receive a \"reward\" for its victory. The removed beads showed the sequence of the winning moves.[17] These were returned to their respective trays, easily identifiable since they were slightly open, as well as three bonus beads of the same colour.[11] In this way, in future games MENACE would become more likely to repeat those winning moves, reinforcing winning strategies. If it lost, the removed beads were not returned, \"punishing\" MENACE, and meaning that in future it would be less likely, and eventually incapable if that colour of bead became absent, to repeat the moves that cause a loss.[4][8] If the game was a draw, one additional bead was added to each box.[11]\n\nNoughts and crosses has a well-known optimal strategy.[18] A player must place their symbol in a way that blocks the other player from achieving any rows while simultaneously making a row themself. However, if both players use this strategy, the game always ends in a draw.[18] If the human player is familiar with the optimal strategy, and MENACE can quickly learn it, then the games will eventually only end in draws. The likelihood of the computer winning increases quickly when the computer plays against a random-playing opponent.[4]\n\nWhen playing against a player using optimal strategy, the odds of a draw grow to 100%. In Donald Michie's official tournament against MENACE in 1961[5] he used optimal strategy, and he and the computer began to draw consistently after twenty games. Michie's tournament[19] had the following milestones: Michie began by consistently opening with \"Variant 0\", the middle square. At 15 games, MENACE abandoned all non-corner openings. At just over 20, Michie switched to consistently using \"Variant 1\", the bottom-right square. At 60, he returned to Variant 0. As he neared 80 games, he moved to \"Variant 2\", the top-middle. At 110, he switched to \"Variant 3\", the top right. At 135, he switched to \"Variant 4\", middle-right. At 190, he returned to Variant 1, and at 210, he returned to Variant 0.\n\nThe trend in changes of beads in the \"2\" boxes runs:[19]\n\nDepending on the strategy employed by the human player, MENACE produces a different trend on scatter graphs of wins.[5] Using a random turn from the human player results in an almost-perfect positive trend. Playing the optimal strategy returns a slightly slower increase.[4] The reinforcement does not create a perfect standard of wins; the algorithm will draw random uncertain conclusions each time. After the j-th round, the correlation of near-perfect play runs:\n\n1\n −\n D\n\n D\n −\n\n D\n\n (\n j\n +\n 2\n )\n\n ∑\n\n i\n =\n 0\n\n j\n\n D\n\n (\n j\n i\n +\n 1\n )\n\n V\n\n i\n\n {\\displaystyle {1-D \\over D-D^{(j+2)}}\\sum _{i=0}^{j}D^{(ji+1)}V_{i}}\n\nWhere Vi is the outcome (+1 is win, 0 is draw and -1 is loss) and D is the decay factor (average of past values of wins and losses). Below, Mn is the multiplier for the n-th round of the game.[5]\n\nDonald Michie's MENACE proved that a computer could learn from failure and success to become good at a task.[17] It used what would become core principles within the field of machine learning before they had been properly theorised. For example, the combination of how MENACE starts with equal numbers of types of beads in each matchbox, and how these are then selected at random, creates a learning behaviour similar to weight initialisation in modern artificial neural networks.[20] In 1968, Donald Michie and R.A Chambers made another BOXES-based algorithm called GLEE (Game Learning Expectimaxing Engine) which had to learn how to balance a pole on a cart.[21]\n\nAfter the resounding reception of MENACE, Michie was invited to the US Office of Naval Research, where he was commissioned to build a BOXES-running program for an IBM Computer for use at Stanford University.[22] Michie created a simulation program of MENACE on a Pegasus 2 computer with the aid of D. Martin.[5] There have been multiple recreations of MENACE in more recent years, both in its original physical form and as a computer program.[12] Its algorithm was later converged into Christopher Watkin's Q-Learning algorithm.[23] Although not as a functional computer, in examples of demonstration, MENACE has been used as a teaching aid for various neural network classes,[24][25][26] including a public demonstration from University College London researcher Matthew Scroggs.[27][28] A copy of MENACE built by Scroggs was featured in the 2019 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures,[29][30] and in a 2023 episode of QI XL.[31]\n\nMENACE is referenced in Fred Saberhagen's 1963 short story Without A Thought, and Thomas J Ryan's 1977 novel The Adolescence of P-1.[32] In her 2023 book The Future, author Naomi Alderman includes a fictional lecture with a detailed overview of MENACE.",

    "description": "A technical breakdown of the timing circuit in the Ursa Major StarGate 323 digital reverb, explaining how a counter and PROM generate 16 coordinated control signals.",
    "fullText": "The Ursa Major StarGate 323 is a digital reverb from 1982 that uses a timing circuit to coordinate all of its internal operations. This post breaks down how that circuit works, from the crystal oscillator to the final control signals.\n\nTo understand how this circuit works, I built a simulation in Logisim Evolution. The animation below shows the circuit running—watch the counter increment while the control signals flip on and off.\n\nThe timing circuit generates 16 control signals that orchestrate everything else in the system: memory access, address sequencing, and more. These signals follow a precise 256-step pattern that repeats continuously. One signal in particular—TCB1—is key to understanding how the StarGate creates its reverb, as it drives the delay system that we'll explore at the end of this post.\n\nRather than using logic gates to derive these signals, the designers took a clever approach: they pre-computed the entire sequence and stored it in PROMs. The circuit simply counts from 0 to 255 and uses each count value to look up the corresponding control byte.\n\nThe timing circuit follows a straightforward pipeline:\n\nEach clock tick advances the counter, which changes the PROM address, which outputs a new control byte, which updates the control signals. The entire cycle takes 256 clock ticks, then repeats.\n\nThe clock is slowed down here—in the actual hardware it runs at 8.192 MHz. The counter cycles through 256 PROM addresses, each outputting 8 control signals. TCB1 is one of these signals, programmed to pulse approximately 15 times per cycle.\n\nTwo 74LS163 4-bit counters are chained together to form an 8-bit counter. U53 handles the low nibble (bits 0-3) and U52 handles the high nibble (bits 4-7).\n\nThe chain works through the carry output: U53 counts 0 through 15, and when it rolls over from 15 to 0, its carry output (C15) pulses high. This carry signal connects to U52's enable inputs (ENP and ENT), causing U52 to increment only when U53 overflows.\n\nThe result is an 8-bit count from 0 to 255. The eight output lines (TC0-TC7) connect directly to the address inputs of both timing PROMs.\n\nTwo 28L22 PROMs (256 x 8-bit) hold the pre-programmed control sequences. Each PROM contains 256 bytes, and each bit of each byte controls one signal. Together they produce 16 control signals—including TCB1—that orchestrate the entire system.\n\nAnalyzing the PROM data reveals how often each signal transitions during one 256-step cycle. The signal that matters most for understanding the reverb is TCB1. It pulses about 15 times per cycle, and each pulse advances the slot counter that addresses the delay PROM. This is the clock that drives the delay tap sequencing—the core of how the StarGate reads back delayed audio at specific tap positions.\n\nThe PROM approach lets the designers encode precise timing relationships that would require complex logic gates to generate otherwise. With 512 bytes total, they could specify exactly what should happen at every step without debugging state machines.\n\nThis matters for TCB1 especially. The slot counter it drives needs to advance at precisely the right moments. That relationship is baked directly into the bit patterns—the designers simply programmed the exact sequence they needed.\n\nTCB1 pulses approximately 15 times per 256-step cycle. Each pulse advances the DAC slot address counter (U72 and U73 in the schematic), which in turn addresses the delay PROM. The delay PROM contains the tap positions—the specific memory addresses where the system reads back delayed audio samples.\n\nThis is the heart of how the StarGate creates reverb: the timing circuit generates TCB1 pulses, TCB1 advances the slot counter, the slot counter addresses the delay PROM, and the delay PROM tells the system where to read from the audio memory. The pattern of tap positions stored in the delay PROM defines the reverb character.\n\nIn the next post, I'll trace this signal path further and explore how the delay system uses these tap positions to create the StarGate's signature sound.",

    "title": "AeroTag – Tag-based workspace management for AeroSpace (macOS)",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "As a long-time AwesomeWM user who has loved using River in recent years, working on macOS was painful for me.\n\nThe other day, my company issued me a new Mac, so I asked an LLM if I could build an environment like Awesome or River on a Mac. The answer was: \"You can do it by combining AeroSpace, AeroRaise, and JankyBorders!\"\n\nI've tried various tiling window managers for macOS, but never AeroSpace. My first impression was good. It's independent of the system's desktop management and lacks unnecessary window animations.\n\nHowever, the fact that its workspace management is completely different from Awesome or River was quite difficult for me. But since I was satisfied with the other aspects, I started thinking that if I could just solve this one issue, I might be able to live comfortably on a Mac.\n\nSince AeroSpace allows retrieving the current state and manipulating it via the command line, I thought I could extend the workspace management with an external tool.[1]\nAnd this is what I built:\n\ntypester/aerotag: Tag-based workspace management for AeroSpace.\n\nThe specific usage is detailed in the README, but basically, instead of writing workspace operations like this:\n\nYou simply use the aerotag command like this:\n\nI aligned the basic commands with Awesome's commands, and for advanced users, I also provided a River-like bitmask API. Using this, users can create commands not originally provided, such as \"remove the focused window from the focused tag\".\n\nI also prepared a command to stream workspace status in real-time. With this, you can render AeroTag's status on a menu bar like SketchyBar. (Since I don't use SketchyBar myself, support for it is provided on a best-effort basis.)\n\nVery few WMs adopt this method—as far as I know, only dwm, awesome, and river—so few readers are likely familiar with it.\n\nTag-based workspaces differ from normal workspaces in that you can display multiple workspaces at once. Also, a window can belong to multiple workspaces.\nFrom a programmer's perspective, both the displayed workspaces and the workspaces a window belongs to are defined by bitmasks.\n\nLet me explain why this is useful using my daily WM usage as an example.\n\nMy most basic workspace (tag) configuration looks like this:\n\nI use 10 tags like this, basically placing one application per tag.\nI also usually place dev tools to the left, communication tools on the far right, and other software to the right.\n\nNow, a common situation is wanting to reference documents or tickets in Firefox while writing code in Emacs, or wanting to do something else while watching logs in a terminal. There is a demand to combine applications across workspaces. This is very easy with a WM that has tag-based workspace management.\n\nIf you are using Emacs (Tag 3 is displayed) and want to reference Firefox, you just need to toggle the display of Tag 2 in addition to Tag 3. Just like that, Tag 2 and Tag 3 are displayed simultaneously, showing the two apps side-by-side (the image below shows Terminal and Emacs, so Tag 1 and Tag 3 are displayed).\n\nAnother common situation is when I have two Firefox windows on Tag 2, but I want to use only one of them with Emacs. In this case, if I use the previous method (displaying Tag 2 and Tag 3 together), both Firefox windows would appear, resulting in a total of 3 windows. That is not ideal, so in this case, I make the Firefox window I want to share belong to Tag 3 as well. This is similar to traditional workspace management, but the difference is that Firefox remains on Tag 2, so it is still available when I open Tag 2.\n\nIn use cases like this, tag-based workspace management is extremely flexible. Once you get used to this mechanism, it becomes painful to be without it, and you will fall into the same situation I am in.\n\nHowever, currently we have Awesome for X Window System, River for Wayland, and now the same mechanism is available on macOS, so the options are aligning (though as mentioned later, Aerotag still has some issues).\n\nI started with Awesome, so I continue to use the keybindings I used in Awesome for both River and AeroTag. This means that once you learn how to use one tag-based WM, transitioning to another is very easy.\n\nOf course, since I am forcing this workspace management on top of the system, issues remain.\n\nWhen combining various apps by toggling tags, the layout generally gets reset.\nIn my case, I mostly use 2 screens (panes), or at most 3 screens[2], so it is not a problem. However, I think it is not practically usable for people who open a massive amount of windows.\n\nI feel the operations via AeroTag are reasonably responsive and natural. However, for example, when activating another app using the open command from the terminal, or switching apps from the Dock, the underlying AeroSpace workspace appears briefly before moving to the AeroTag-managed workspace. As a result, the screen flickers for a moment.\nThis is unavoidable due to the current specifications, so we just have to give up on it for now.\n\nDespite various issues and quirks, I am personally very satisfied with this environment. Restricted to my specific use case, I can now have almost the same experience on macOS as developing on Linux, which makes me incredibly happy. I am even starting to think I could make the Mac my main environment.\n\nIf you are interested, please give it a try. I would be happy to hear your feedback.",

    "description": "The investigation, which centers on renovations of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, signals an escalation in the long-running clash between President Trump and the chair.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia has opened a criminal investigation into Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, over the central bank’s renovation of its Washington headquarters and whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress about the scope of the project, according to officials briefed on the situation.\n\nThe inquiry, which includes an analysis of Mr. Powell’s public statements and an examination of spending records, was approved in November by Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of President Trump who was appointed to run the office last year, the officials said.\n\nThe investigation escalates Mr. Trump’s long-running feud with Mr. Powell, whom the president has continually attacked for resisting his demands to slash interest rates significantly. The president has threatened to fire the Fed chair — even though he nominated Mr. Powell for the position in 2017 — and raised the prospect of a lawsuit against him related to the $2.5 billion renovation, citing “incompetence.”\n\nMr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview last week that he had decided on who he wants to replace Mr. Powell as Fed chair. He is expected to soon announce his decision. Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, is a front-runner for the top job. While Mr. Powell’s term as chair ends in May, his term as a governor runs through January 2028. Mr. Powell has not disclosed whether he plans to stay on at the central bank beyond this year.\n\nIn a rare video message released by the Fed on Sunday, Mr. Powell described the investigation as “unprecedented” and questioned the motivation for the move, even as he affirmed that he carried out his duties as chair “without political fear or favor.”\n\n“This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,” he said. “It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts.”\n\nHe warned that the investigation signaled a broader battle over the Fed’s independence. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”\n\nA spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi did not comment on the investigation but said Ms. Bondi had “instructed her U.S. attorneys to prioritize investing any abuses of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s investigation into Mr. Powell underscores Mr. Trump’s larger clash with the Fed. Other broadsides have included an effort to oust Lisa D. Cook, a governor at the central bank whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of mortgage fraud. Presidents are able to remove officials at the Fed only for “cause,” which has typically meant malfeasance or a dereliction of duty. The Supreme Court will hear arguments for Ms. Cook’s case on Jan. 21.\n\nCongress granted the Fed the authority to set interest rates free of meddling from presidents, whose political fortunes are often tethered to how the economy is faring. Rather, lawmakers stipulated that the central bank should pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market.\n\nMr. Powell said on Sunday that the Justice Department had served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas. Prosecutors in Ms. Pirro’s office have contacted Mr. Powell’s staff multiple times to request documents about the renovation project, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation who discussed an open inquiry on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStarting an investigation is one thing, presenting sufficient evidence to secure an indictment from a federal grand jury — or making it stick — is another.\n\nIndictments against two of Mr. Trump’s top targets, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, were thrown out in November by a federal judge. An investigation into Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, has yet to yield enough evidence to present to a grand jury.\n\nThe renovations at the center of the investigation into Mr. Powell broke ground in 2022 and are set to be completed in 2027. They are estimated to be about $700 million over budget. The project involves expanding and modernizing the Marriner S. Eccles Building and another building on Constitution Avenue, which date to the 1930s.\n\nThe Fed has said that neither of those buildings has been “comprehensively renovated” since their construction nearly 100 years ago, suggesting they were in need of a significant overhaul. Part of the project includes removing asbestos and lead contamination as well as making the facilities compliant with laws related to accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nA 2021 version of the Fed’s proposal described private elevators and dining rooms for top policymakers, water fountains and new marble features, in addition to a rooftop terrace for staff. Pressed at a congressional hearing in June, Mr. Powell denied that many of those features were part of the latest proposal.\n\n“There’s no V.I.P. dining room; there’s no new marble,” he said. “We took down the old marble, we’re putting it back up. We’ll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke. But there’s no special elevators. There’s just old elevators that have been there.”\n\nMr. Powell added that the project’s plans had “continued to evolve” and that some features that had been initially incorporated were scrapped.\n\nAfter Mr. Powell’s testimony, the Fed published a “Frequently Asked Questions” post on its website that reaffirmed Mr. Powell’s answers to lawmakers. The central bank continued to share additional details, including a virtual tour as well as photographs and annotations to the 2021 proposal that prompted the criticism.\n\nIn explaining the cost overruns, the central bank cited expenses tied to materials, equipment and labor as well as unforeseen circumstances, such as more asbestos than anticipated and soil contamination.",

A U.S. official confirmed the two men spoke but did not say what topics they discussed.\n\nIsrael has not signalled a desire ⁠to intervene in Iran as protests ​grip the country, with tensions between ​the two arch-foes high over Israeli concerns about Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\n\nIn an interview with ‍the Economist published ⁠on Friday, Netanyahu said there would be horrible consequences for Iran if it were to attack Israel.

    "title": "Elon Musk asked people to upload their medical data to X so his AI company could learn to interpret MRIs and CT scans",
    "description": "Health care experts are worried about Grok’s potential to breach patient privacy.",
    "fullText": "In Elon Musk’s world, AI is the new MD. The X owner is encouraging users to upload their medical test results—such as CT and bone scans—to the platform so that Grok, X’s artificial intelligence chatbot, can learn how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nHe’s previously said this information will be used to train X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk reposted a video on X of himself talking about uploading medical data to Grok, saying: “Try it!”\n\n“You can upload your X-rays or MRI images to Grok and it will give you a medical diagnosis,” Musk said in the video, which was uploaded in June. “I have seen cases where it’s actually better than what doctors tell you.\n\nIn 2024, Musk said medical images uploaded to Grok would be used to train the bot.\n\n“This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good,” Musk wrote on X. “Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work.”\n\nMusk also claimed in his response Grok saved a man in Norway by diagnosing a problem his doctors failed to notice. The X owner was willing to upload his own medical information to his bot.\n\n“I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,” Musk said in an episode of the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast released on Tuesday. “None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.”\n\nMusk did not disclose in the podcast why he received an MRI. XAI, which owns X, told Fortune in a statement: “Legacy Media Lies.”\n\nGrok is facing some competition in the AI health space. This week OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, an experience within the bot feature that allows users to securely connect medical records and wellness apps like MyFitnessPal and Apple Health. The company said it would not train the models using personal medical information.\n\nAI chatbots have become a ubiquitous source of medical information for people. OpenAI reported this week 40 million people seek health information from the model, 55% of which used to bot to look up or better understand symptoms.\n\nSo far, Grok’s ability to detect medical abnormalities have been mixed. The AI successfully analyzed blood test results and identified breast cancer, some users claimed. But it also grossly misinterpreted other pieces of information, according to physicians who responded to some of Musk’s about Grok’s ability to interpret medical information. In one instance, Grok mistook a “textbook case” of tuberculosis for a herniated disk or spinal stenosis. In another, the bot mistook a mammogram of a benign breast cyst for an image of testicles.\n\nA May 2025 study found that while all AI models have limitations in processing and predicting medical outcomes, Grok was the most effectively compared to Google’s Gemini and ChatGPT-4o when determining the presence of pathologies in 35,711 slices of brain MRI.\n\n“We know they have the technical capability,” Dr. Laura Heacock, associate professor at the New York University Langone Health Department of Radiology, wrote on X. “Whether or not they want to put in the time, data and [graphics processing units] to include medical imaging is up to them. For now, non-generative AI methods continue to outperform in medical imaging.”\n\nMusk’s lofty goal of training his AI to make medical diagnoses is also a risky one, experts said. While AI has increasingly been used as a means to make complicated science more accessible and create assistive technologies, teaching Grok to use data from a social media platform presents concerns about both Grok’s accuracy and user privacy.\n\nRyan Tarzy, CEO of health technology firm Avandra Imaging, said in an interview with Fast Company asking users to directly input data, rather than source it from secure databases with de-identified patient data, is Musk’s way of trying to accelerate Grok’s development. Also, the information comes from a limited sample of whoever is willing to upload their images and tests—meaning the AI is not gathering data from sources representative of the broader and more diverse medical landscape.\n\nMedical information shared on social media isn’t bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the federal law that protects patients’ private information from being shared without their consent. That means there’s less control over where the information goes after a user chooses to share it.\n\n“This approach has myriad risks, including the accidental sharing of patient identities,” Tarzy said. “Personal health information is ‘burned in’ too many images, such as CT scans, and would inevitably be released in this plan.”\n\nThe privacy dangers Grok may present aren’t fully known because X may have privacy protections not known by the public, according to Matthew McCoy, assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He said users share medical information at their own risk.\n\n“As an individual user, would I feel comfortable contributing health data?” he previously told the New York Times. “Absolutely not.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on Nov. 20, 2024.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Health in a push to become a hub for personal health data\n\nOpenAI suggests ChatGPT play doctor as millions of Americans face spiking insurance costs: ‘In the U.S., ChatGPT has become an important ally’\n\nAs Utah gives the AI power to prescribe some drugs, physicians warn of patient risks\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

In 2024, about 36,000 complaints were filed to the IC3 about tech support scams. Of those, 16,777 were filed by those 60 or older.\n\nIn terms of dollars, those complaints led to a staggering $1,464,755,976 in losses (of that, $982,440,006 were losses for those 60 and older).\n\nBut the number of incidents and amount lost could be much higher due to unreported fraud.",

    "title": "This One Morning Mistake Makes You Crave Sugar All Day, Registered Dietitians Say",
    "description": "Here's why it happens—and how to avoid it.",
    "fullText": "If one of your 2026 goals is to eat healthier, you’re probably doing your best to keep your sugar intake to a minimum. While there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a sweet treat every now and then, having a diet high in sugar is linked to some pretty detrimental health issues.\n\nExcess sugar doesn’t just affect your waistline—it can influence your energy levels, mood, hormones and even how well you sleep at night. Over time, frequent blood sugar spikes and crashes can leave you feeling drained, foggy and irritable, making it harder to stick with healthy habits long-term.\n\nA diet high in sugar is also bad for your gut (and gut health is important for, well, everything), can lead to obesity, increase your risk of dementia and is detrimental to heart health. But even when you make a conscious effort to minimize your sugar intake, it can feel like your body is rebelling against you, making you crave sugar all day long.\n\nThis is a frustrating cycle that might make you think you don't have any willpower, when really, there are other factors at play. Things like blood sugar imbalance, inadequate protein or fiber intake, chronic stress and poor sleep can all amplify sugar cravings—even if you’re eating an overall healthy diet.\n\nAs registered dietitians explain here, there are several causes for sugar cravings, including one super common morning habit. Here's what to know.\n\n🩺\nAccording to registered dietitians, what you eat for breakfast can impact the type or cravings you have—or don’t have—the rest of the day. If your breakfast doesn’t have adequate protein (or you skip breakfast completely), it can lead to sugar cravings.\n\n“Including protein at breakfast slows digestion, supports steady energy and helps you feel satisfied for longer. It also signals to your body early in the day that it’s getting what it needs, which can reduce that mid-morning or afternoon pull toward sweets,” says Melissa Karp, RD, a registered dietitian and the founder of MPM Nutrition.\n\nKarp explains that when we eat protein, digestion slows, which helps prevent the blood sugar spikes and crashes that often drive cravings for quick energy, like sweets. “Protein also activates satiety hormones, helping your brain register fullness so you’re less likely to keep reaching for food in search of satisfaction,” she says.\n\nIn terms of how much protein you should aim to get at breakfast, Ashley Koff, RD, a registered dietitian, author of Your Best Shot and founder of The Better Nutrition Program, recommends getting between 15 and 40 grams, depending on your age, sex and how active you are. Some breakfast ideas Koff says to consider are eggs with half a sweet potato or a high-protein smoothie.\n\nKarp is also a fan of eggs or a smoothie for breakfast as a way to prevent sugar cravings later. “Eggs are a simple, powerful breakfast protein, with about 6 to 7 grams per egg,” she says, adding that she recommends pairing them with a sprouted-grain English muffin for an extra 8 grams of protein. “Adding avocado provides heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and soluble fiber, helping round out the meal and increase staying power.\"\n\nWhen making a smoothie, Karp says protein powder, fruit, spinach, chia seeds and nut butter are all nutrient-rich ingredients to consider.\n\nWhile getting adequate protein at breakfast can help prevent sugar cravings later in the day, there are other reasons why you may be craving sugar. Both dietitians say that not getting enough sleep the night before can lead to sugar cravings the next day.\n\n“When we don’t get enough sleep, our bodies are running on empty and searching for energy. The easiest way for our bodies to get a quick source of energy is sugar. On top of that, lack of sleep disrupts key appetite hormones, increasing hunger-driving ghrelin and decreasing leptin, which signals fullness, making high-carb and sugary foods especially appealing,” Karp explains.\n\nShe adds that not getting enough sleep also impacts blood sugar, which can then lead to sugar cravings, explaining, “Research shows that insulin sensitivity drops after poor sleep, meaning our bodies don’t use glucose as efficiently. That can lead to bigger blood sugar swings, which further fuel cravings for quick fixes, like sweets. In short, it’s not a lack of willpower, it’s your physiology responding to being overtired.\"\n\nIf you use artificial sweeteners, which are often found in foods branded as “diet” or “sugar-free,” Koff says this is something else that can lead to sugar cravings later. This is because artificial sweeteners confuse the brain’s hunger signals; it thinks it’s getting fuel in the form of sugar, but it’s not. This can lead to an increased appetite for sweet foods.\n\nBoth dietitians say that there are other causes for sugar cravings, including seeing sweet foods that look yummy, hormonal changes, feeling stressed, letting yourself get too hungry and having unbalanced meals. So, if you are making a conscious effort to get adequate protein at breakfast and you’re still craving sugar all day, it can be helpful to consider these other potential causes.\n\nMelissa Karp, RD, registered dietitian and the founder of MPM Nutrition\n\nAshley Koff, RD, registered dietitian, author of Your Best Shot and founder of The Better Nutrition Program\n\nZhang, Y., Walker, R.W., Kaplan, R.C., et al.

    "fullText": "The awards show ballot was once an innocent watch-party game.\n\nNow, millions of dollars are at stake.\n\nFans planning to watch the 83rd Golden Globe Awards are plowing money into prediction markets, hoping for a windfall if they correctly choose a winner.\n\nMillions have so far been bet on Golden Globe winners on Polymarket, one of the leading prediction market platforms. This year, Polymarket partnered with the Golden Globes, which airs on CBS and Paramount+ on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n\"The collaboration will bring real-time, market-driven insights across the Golden Globes live events and a broad digital and editorial ecosystem touching fans' greatest passion points across entertainment, fashion and pop culture,\" a joint press release said.\n\nPrediction markets, such as Polymarket and Kalshi, allow users to buy and sell shares on the outcomes of future events, including sports games or presidential elections, potentially resulting in a payday. Polymarket also provides real-time updates, meaning the data can provide insights into how consumers and investors think.\n\nThe relatively new markets are not strictly regulated, leaving room for those with insider knowledge to game the system. A last-minute bet on Polymarket last week that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro would be ousted netted strong returns after the US captured Maduro in a surprise raid hours later. A new bill proposed last week in response would prohibit government officials from insider trading on prediction markets.\n\nFor the Globes, fans have already bet nearly $2.5 million in contracts across 30 awards show categories on Polymarket, including Best Director and Best Motion Picture, as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nSo, who do betters think will win?\n\nOn Polymarket, betters think Paul Thomas Anderson, whose film \"One Battle After Another\" also snagged Golden Globe noms, has a 94% chance of winning Best Director. Ryan Coogler, director of \"Sinners,\" is behind Anderson at 3%.\n\nBetters gave Wagner Moura, who starred in \"The Secret Agent,\" a 73% chance of winning Best Actor in a motion picture drama. Michael B. Jordan of \"Sinners\" had a 24% chance.\n\nBest Actor — Musical or Comedy winner\n\nTimothee Chalamet, star of \"Marty Supreme,\" led with a 70% chance to win Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy motion picture on Sunday afternoon. Leonardo DiCaprio followed Chalamet at 17% for his work in \"One Battle After Another.\"\n\n\"Hamnet\" star Jessie Buckley had a 96% of winning Best Actress in a drama motion picture. Behind Buckley, betters gave Renate Reinsve of \"Sentimental Value\" a 3% chance of winning.\n\nBest Actress — Musical or Comedy winner\n\nPolymarket betters think Rose Byrne has a 76% chance of winning a Golden Globe Award for her role in the film, \"If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.\" Emma Stone, star of \"Bugonia,\" came in second at 12%.\n\nBest Motion Picture — Animated winner\n\nOn Polymarket, users gave Netflix's \"KPop Demon Hunters\" a 92% chance of winning the top animation prize. \"Acro,\" written and directed by Ugo Bienvenu, followed at a 5% chance.\n\nBest Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy winner\n\nBetters on Polymarket threw their money behind \"One Battle After Another\" to win this category at 97%, beating \"Marty Supreme,\" which had a 2% chance.\n\nBest Motion Picture — Drama winner\n\n\"Sinners\" had the highest chance to win Best Motion Picture in the drama category on Polymarket at 55%. \"Hamnet\" came behind that at a 31% chance.",

    "description": "I worried my toddler might wander out of the house after moving to a bed, so I got a home security system to help me sleep at night.",
    "fullText": "When I switched my then-2-year-old daughter from a crib to a bed, my biggest concern was resistance.\n\nI wanted to help her sleep soundly in her new \"big girl\" bed. But once she did, I didn't expect my own sleep to continue to be disrupted as well.\n\nI woke up at every creak of the house, wondering if it was my daughter roaming around, exploring her newfound freedom. I knew it was incredibly unlikely, but I feared that she would unlock the door and walk outside in the middle of the night.\n\nI looked for gadgets designed for this exact situation; there are dozens of devices meant for securing small children in their rooms. The solution I decided on surprised my friends: a home security system. While home security traditionally focuses on keeping intruders out of the house, it also works surprisingly well at keeping tiny humans in.\n\nI did nearly everything wrong during the crib-to-bed transition with my daughter. I made the switch on the same week we returned from an international trip, which involved a 15-hour time difference and jet lag that made us both feel delirious. And, instead of researching recommended ways to introduce her to the bed and help her learn to stay in her room at night, I just winged it. I sat outside her door, exhausted, and put her back into bed every time she came out.\n\nNight after night, it did not get any easier.\n\nFinally, I changed my approach and researched the best ways to transition toddlers to a bed. Once I learned the best practices, it clicked, and I kicked myself for not starting there in the first place. I successfully reintroduced my toddler to her new bed, and, as proud as I felt once she started falling asleep peacefully, I still felt unsettled.\n\nEven though she was staying in her room until she fell asleep, I kept wondering what would happen if she wandered out in the middle of the night? The idea that she might slip outside while I was asleep felt far-fetched, but the tiny chance that it could happen lingered in my mind.\n\nThere is a heated debate among parents and experts on whether it is appropriate to lock your toddler in their room at night. Some experts cite the concern as a safety issue: in the event of a fire or other emergency, the child wouldn't be able to get out. Though I realized that when my daughter was previously in her crib, she wouldn't have been able to get out on her own either, which made the safety argument feel less clear-cut to me. Others argue that locking a child in can create emotional distress.\n\nThere's also the other side: preventing a toddler from leaving their room can help keep them safe. I feared that my daughter might get confused in the middle of the night and wander not just out of her room, but out of the house entirely if she wasn't secured in. My daughter is cautious, but toddlers are unpredictable, especially if they unexpectedly wake in the middle of the night. I weighed using a baby gate or doorknob cover, but ultimately decided to get a home security system instead.\n\nWhile there are plenty of DIY home security systems, I'm not handy and didn't have the time or energy to devote to figuring it out. I decided to go with Vivint, a smart home security company, instead. My top priority was getting door sensors so that I would be alerted if anyone opened an outside door at night. This ensured that I didn't have to worry about my daughter quietly leaving the house in the middle of the night. Who knows? This may continue to be beneficial when she becomes a teenager as well.\n\nFrom the catalog, I also added an outdoor camera so I could keep an eye on her in the backyard if she is out playing while I am cooking dinner. I also started planning ahead for features that would be useful when she's older; I decided to get a smart lock for the front door. When she's older and more independent, she will be able to enter the house with a code instead of carrying a key.\n\nDuring the day, the Vivint app is programmed to alert me to different activities around the house. So, I get alerted if my daughter forgets to close the sliding door when she comes inside, among other things. At night, the system is programmed to be armed between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., which means that if anyone opens a door, a loud alarm will sound and the security company notified.\n\nWhen I go to bed, I'm reassured knowing that if my daughter does wander outside at night, whether out of curiosity or confusion, I'll know about it instantly. Now, instead of waking up at every small noise, checking her baby monitor to make sure she's still safely in bed, I finally sleep more soundly.\n\nA security system won't solve bedtime struggles. But it helped me get more rest once my daughter was sleeping well in her new bed. While home security may typically be used to get bad guys out, it can also give you peace of mind that you're keeping your toddler in.",

    "description": "A tattoo artist skipped store-bought gifts and gave her family tattoos, creating a meaningful tradition rooted in creativity and trust.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Madi Ford. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGrowing up, I loved art and was what some might call an \"alternative\" type of teenager. Unlike other parents, my dad always encouraged me to take art classes and never dampened my desire to make art a career.\n\nAt 16, I remember wanting to be a tattoo artist, but I didn't think it was a viable career. I was scared and nervous about making the jump, unsure of the path I needed to follow to make it happen. I even remember telling my dad that maybe I would attend cosmetology school to work on hair instead. He looked at me and said, \"You don't want to do hair. You want to tattoo. Don't give up.\"\n\nWhen I turned 18, I got my first tattoo, and my dad made a big deal about it when I showed him. He took a photo of it and posted it on Instagram. Whereas lots of kids hide tattoos from their parents, I had a dad who encouraged them because he knew how much I loved them.\n\nAfter going in to have my first tattoo, surrounded by a welcoming and creative environment, I decided to ask if I could be an apprentice to one of the artists in the same shop where I had my tattoo done.\n\nThree years later, once I had developed skills and felt ready, I asked my dad and stepmom if they'd like me to do tattoos for them. Dad had a daruma doll, a Japanese wooden doll, and my stepmom had a red-headed nurse to represent her years working as a nurse.\n\nTo give them both something of myself, of my own artistic style, was incredibly meaningful, and it went on to inspire me to do it again for more of my family this past Christmas.\n\nWhile my partner and I typically travel three hours to see my family, we asked my dad, stepmom, stepsister, step-aunt, and her partner to come to us on December 26 instead, and spend a few days in Missoula with us.\n\nI asked them if they'd like me to give each of them a tattoo as a Christmas present, and each of them agreed, thinking in advance about what they'd like to have. They all shared their ideas for the tattoos they wanted and explained why they wanted them. It was a glimpse into who they were and what was important to them.\n\nOn December 26, I opened the shop at 10 a.m., and we spent the day tattooing, taking only a brief break for lunch.\n\nIt was special for me to get to know each of my family members at such a vulnerable point for them. It provides a great icebreaker for conversation and enables me to spend ample time getting to know someone.\n\nAlthough I know my dad and stepmom well, I don't see my other family members often, and this was the perfect opportunity for me to get to know them and for them to get to know me. It was one-on-one time that we wouldn't have had in a large, family gathering.\n\nInstead of giving them a generic Christmas present, I was able to give them a handmade, personalized gift, which was an extension of me. And it's a way to connect and get to know each other on a deeper level.\n\nAnother thing I love about tattooing friends and family is inviting them into my shop, where they can see that tattoo shops are for everyone. They often carry a reputation as being for only the coolest and toughest people, but that's not true, at least not for all of them.\n\nAfter my family had their tattoos, they couldn't stop talking about how much they loved them, and my dad spoke endlessly of how proud he was of me.\n\nI'll definitely be offering the same in the future whenever family comes to visit. I think it might be the best gift I can give them.",

    "fullText": "When my husband and I decided to get married seven years ago, we pictured a modern \"Brady Bunch.\"\n\nBetween us, we had eight children, ranging in age from 3 to 15. We knew it would be a challenge, but we imagined warmth, energy, excitement — maybe even fun.\n\nThe reactions we got should've warned us. \"Wow, that's a lot,\" people would say. Or, \"You must really love each other to take that on.\" But we were sure we'd be different. We'd already been through failed marriages. We were determined not to fail again. We were unrealistically optimistic, and — looking back — very naïve.\n\nWe bought a house, created tiny dorm-style bedrooms so each child had their own space, and set out to \"blend\" our families.\n\nThere were good moments — pasta dinners around our big dining room table, pumpkin carving contests, silly talent shows, and games of croquet in the front yard. But there were also times when nothing felt blended at all. It was like going on vacation with another family: at first, you politely adjust, until suddenly you're thinking, When do they leave so we can get back to normal?\n\nWe hadn't grown together, and our family cultures were completely different. At dinner, my husband or his kids would say something that sent them into hysterics while my offspring and I stared blankly — and vice versa.\n\nAs the months passed, our best intentions felt dangerously close to disaster. I found his parenting too strict. He found mine too permissive. I wanted space from him and his kids. He longed for more unity.\n\nThen our children began clashing — there were fights about 2% milk vs. skim milk, time spent in the bathroom, music preferences, and his daughter's ferret that kept escaping into my daughter's underwear drawer. The more they fought, the more each set of biological siblings rallied to defend each other.\n\nOne weekend at a cabin, hoping to make memories, everything fell apart. Rivalries escalated during a game of \"steal the flag,\" and accusations and hurt feelings ensued. Finally, my husband packed up his kids and drove home early. The moment they left, my side and I let out an involuntary cheer — pure relief.\n\nMy husband and I loved each other, but privately we each wondered if we had made a terrible mistake.\n\nIn desperation, I researched blended families, and everything I read made me feel worse. Even the term felt like an accusation. Nothing about our family resembled a smooth blend. It felt more like a chaotic stew—one no one had asked for. What if blending was simply impossible? What if it wasn't even the right goal?\n\nFacing what felt like collapse, we decided to stop trying to force something that wasn't happening. Instead, we focused on simply living alongside each other with respect. A side-by-side family. I took care of my son and daughters. He took care of his brood. We shared pizza dinners when everyone was home. If one of us planned a game night, the others were invited but never pressured to go. We learned that each child needed alone time with their original parent — and that honoring this made everyone calmer, happier, and more secure.\n\nWe stopped critiquing each other's parenting. We asked for advice only when we genuinely were ready to hear it. We reminded ourselves that we had chosen each other, but the kids hadn't chosen any of this. They deserve time and space to adapt at their own pace.\n\nNearly eight years later, the slow, separate, respectful approach has worked far better than the fantasy \"blend.\" We still have rough days, but most of us get along, there's warmth in the house, and I'd say — slowly, imperfectly — we're marinating together just fine.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic is rolling out a major expansion of its healthcare and life-sciences offerings, as AI companies race to embed large language models more deeply into regulated medical workflows.\n\nThe company on Sunday announced Claude for Healthcare, a product that allows healthcare providers, insurers, and consumers to use Claude for medical purposes through HIPAA-ready infrastructure.\n\nThe launch builds on Anthropic's earlier release of Claude for Life Sciences, which focused on research and drug discovery, and reflects the company's broader effort to position its AI models as practical tools for regulated industries.\n\nThe move also underscores intensifying competition in healthcare AI. OpenAI recently unveiled a rival product, and startups including Abridge and Sword Health have attracted multibillion-dollar valuations as investors pour money into AI tools for medicine.\n\nAnthropic said Claude for Healthcare is designed to reduce administrative work and help both clinicians and patients better understand medical information. The tools are powered by recent improvements to the company's flagship model, Claude Opus 4.5, which Anthropic says performs significantly better than earlier versions on simulated medical and scientific tasks while showing fewer factual errors.\n\nAs part of the healthcare expansion, Claude can now connect directly to several industry-standard databases. These include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Coverage Database, ICD-10 medical coding data, the National Provider Identifier Registry, and PubMed's biomedical research library. Anthropic said these connectors allow Claude to quickly surface relevant information, support prior authorization workflows, and help clinicians and administrators generate reports more efficiently.\n\nThe company is also introducing customizable \"Agent Skills,\" including sample tools for streamlining prior authorization requests and assisting developers in building applications using FHIR, the modern standard for exchanging healthcare data between systems.\n\nOn the consumer side, Anthropic is rolling out integrations that let US subscribers on its Pro and Max plans give Claude secure access to their personal health records. New connectors include HealthEx and Function Health, with Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect integrations launching in beta via Claude's mobile apps. Anthropic said data accessed through these integrations isn't stored in Claude's memory or used to train its models.\n\nAnthropic is also expanding Claude's capabilities for life sciences customers, adding connectors to platforms such as Medidata, ClinicalTrials.gov, and bioRxiv. New agent skills support tasks like drafting FDA- and NIH-compliant clinical trial protocols or monitoring trial performance.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "A massive solar panel array in China is expected to crack 7,000 megawatts of power generation in 2026, according to EnergiesMedia.\n\nThe Three Gorges Kubuqi Solar Park has been under construction since 2022, blanketing an Inner Mongolian desert in panels. It already has over five gigawatts of capacity installed.\n\n\"Sandy and mostly devoid of life, the Kubuqi Desert in Inner Mongolia once had a reputation for being a 'sea of death.' More recently, its dune fields have become a sea of photovoltaic possibility, transformed by a surge of newly installed solar panels,\" NASA said of the project. \"The construction is part of China's multiyear plan to build a 'solar great wall' designed to generate enough energy to power Beijing.\"\n\nDoing so has the potential to displace China's heavy reliance on coal power. This energy source generates some of the highest levels of pollution in the world, contributing to more destructive weather patterns and steep health costs for locals.\n\nThe Three Gorges Kubuqi Solar Park, due to be completed in 2030, will be 250 miles long, three miles wide, and will be able to generate 100 gigawatts of clean energy. Locals are also enjoying the unexpected benefits of the project.\n\n\"These projects shield us from wind and sand, allowing our village to cultivate over 10,000 mu (600 hectares) of high-standard farmland this year. If leased out, the land can bring villagers 900 yuan ($128) per mu each year,\" said local farmer Han Rongkuan, per Xinhua.\n\nLarge-scale solar is an important step to displacing polluting fuels, like coal, gas, and oil, but home solar does its part, too.\n\n• EnergySage can help you save up to $10,000 on installations by curating competitive bids from local installers \n• Not ready to spend up front? Palmetto's $0-down LightReach solar leasing program can lower your utility rate by up to 20% \n• TCD's Solar Explorer makes it easy to access exclusive offers from preferred partners\n\nYou can get even more out of home solar upgrades by using TCD's HVAC Explorer.

    "fullText": "TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Richard “Dick” Codey, a former acting governor of New Jersey and the longest serving legislator in the state's history, died Sunday. He was 79.\n\nCodey’s wife, Mary Jo Codey, confirmed her husband’s death to The Associated Press.\n\n“Gov. Richard J. Codey passed away peacefully this morning at home, surrounded by family, after a brief illness,” Codey's family wrote in a Facebook post on Codey's official page.\n\n\"Our family has lost a beloved husband, father and grandfather -- and New Jersey lost a remarkable public servant who touched the lives of all who knew him,\" the family said.\n\nKnown for his feisty, regular-guy persona, Codey was a staunch advocate of mental health awareness and care issues. The Democrat also championed legislation to ban smoking from indoor areas and sought more money for stem cell research.\n\nCodey, the son of a northern New Jersey funeral home owner, entered the state Assembly in 1974 and served there until he was elected to the state Senate in 1982. He served as Senate president from 2002 to 2010.\n\nCodey first served as acting governor for a brief time in 2002, after Christine Todd Whitman’s resignation to join President George W. Bush’s administration. He held the post again for 14 months after Gov. Jim McGreevey resigned in 2004.\n\nAt that time, New Jersey law mandated that the Senate president assume the governor’s role if a vacancy occurred, and that person would serve until the next election.\n\nCodey routinely drew strong praise from residents in polls, and he gave serious consideration to seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2005. But he ultimately chose not to run when party leaders opted to back wealthy Wall Street executive Jon Corzine, who went on to win the office.\n\nCodey would again become acting governor after Corzine was incapacitated in April 2007 due to serious injuries he suffered in a car accident. He held the post for nearly a month before Corzine resumed his duties.\n\nAfter leaving the governor’s office, Codey returned to the Senate and also published a memoir that detailed his decades of public service, along with stories about his personal and family life.\n\n“He lived his life with humility, compassion and a deep sense of responsibility to others,” his family wrote. “He made friends as easily with Presidents as he did with strangers in all-night diners.”\n\nCodey and his wife often spoke candidly about her past struggles with postpartum depression, and that led to controversy in early 2005, when a talk radio host jokingly criticized Mary Jo and her mental health on the air.\n\nCodey, who was at the radio station for something else, confronted the host and said he told him that he wished he could “take him outside.” But the host claimed Codey actually threatened to “take him out,” which Codey denied.\n\nHis wife told The Associated Press that Codey was willing to support her speaking out about postpartum depression, even if it cost him elected office.\n\n“He was a really, really good guy,” Mary Jo Codey said. “He said, ‘If you want to do it, I don’t care if I get elected again.’”\n\nJack Brook contributed reporting from New Orleans.",

    "fullText": "Yet another data center will soon emerge near the Far Westside of San Antonio, according to a recent Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) filing. It's set to further the Lone Star State's reputation as a tech cluster.\n\nThe quaint town of Castroville, with a population of just over 3,000, will soon house a $400 million development owned by Microsoft. Online records show that the project, named SAT 82, will take up roughly 195,000 square feet in Medina County.\n\nAlthough it's only a one-story building, it will take nearly two years to build, according to the TDLR. Construction at the spot, 3580 FM 471 North, will begin on Thursday, August 13, 2026. A visit to the property revealed that equipment and a welcome poster were already on site. An open field, a two-lane road, and residential properties sit nearby.\n\nIn time, the structure will likely take on the look of a windowless warehouse. It may be hard for residents to get a clear glimpse of the center, as each contains extensive fencing around its perimeters for safety and security purposes, Microsoft's website states.\n\nSAT 82 joins six others in Medina County, according to the TDLR: SAT 80, SAT 81, SAT 89/90, SAT 93, SAT 94, and another with the title SAT 82, but with a different address.\n\nThe centers provide the infrastructure needed to open a phone application, join a virtual Zoom meeting, play an online game, and more. According to the company's website, they also allow the company's Azure cloud platform, AI, and collaboration tools to continue operating as normal.\n\nEarlier this fall, community members in a private Redbird Ranch neighborhood Facebook group voiced concerns over Microsoft's presence in the area. A few users worried the company's projects would worsen traffic. Others highlighted the massive amount of water that data centers use.\n\nIn a 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft said that its water consumption in 2023 - which includes but is not limited to data centers - increased by 1.7 billion gallons from the previous year, coming in at 2.1 billion gallons. The company attributed the increase to its business growth.\n\n\"Improvements as part of our Redmond campus modernization project are estimated to yield over 50% reduction in water use for new facilities,\" it continued in the report.\n\nConstruction on the property is expected to wrap up by 2028, according to the TDLR.\n\nThis article originally published at Microsoft bets $400M on tiny Texas town with new massive data center.",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The German government has sharply rejected accusations by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claiming that it has been sidelining patient autonomy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“The statements made by the US Secretary of Health are completely unfounded, factually incorrect, and must be rejected,” German Health Minister Nina Warken said in a statement late Saturday.\n\nKennedy said in a video post earlier on Saturday that he had sent the German minister a letter based on reports coming out of Germany that the government was “limiting people’s abilities to act on their own convictions when they face medical decisions.”\n\nThe American health secretary said that “I've learned that more than a thousand German physicians and thousands of their patients now face prosecution and punishment for issuing exemptions from wearing masks or getting COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\"\n\nWarken rejected Kennedy’s claims, saying that “during the coronavirus pandemic, there was never any obligation on the medical profession to administer COVID-19 vaccinations. Anyone who did not want to offer vaccinations for medical, ethical, or personal reasons was not liable to prosecution, nor did they have to fear sanctions.”\n\nKennedy did not give provide specific examples or say which reports he was referring to but added that “in my letter, I explained that Germany is targeting physicians who put their patients first and punishing citizens for making their own medical choices.”\n\nHe concluded that \"the German government is now violating the sacred patient physician relationship, replacing it is a dangerous system that makes physicians enforcers of state policies.”\n\nKennedy said that in his letter he made clear that “Germany has the opportunity and the responsibility to correct this trajectory, to restore medical autonomy, to end politically motivated prosecutions.”\n\nWarken pointed out that there were no professional bans or fines for not getting vaccinated.\n\n“Criminal prosecution was only pursued in cases of fraud and document forgery, such as the issuance of false vaccination certificates or fake mask certificates,\" the minister said.\n\nShe also clarified that in general in Germany “patients are also free to decide which therapy they wish to undergo.”\n\nFormer German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who was in charge during the pandemic, also replied, addressing Kennedy directly on X saying that he “should take care of health problems in his own country. Short life expectancy, extreme costs, tens of thousands of drug deaths and murder victims.\"\n\n“In Germany, doctors are not punished by the government for issuing false medical certificates. In our country, the courts are independent,” Lauterbach wrote.\n\nWhile a majority of Germans were eager to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus during the pandemic, there were also protests by a small minority of vaccine skeptics in Germany which were sometimes supported by far-right movements.",

    "fullText": "A Bitcoin miner from the network’s earliest days has emerged from dormancy to shift 2,000 BTC, a strategic profit-taking move valued at approximately $181 million.\n\nCryptoQuant's Julio Moreno noted that this represents the most significant activity by a \"Satoshi-era\" whale since late 2024.\n\nMoreno highlighted the timing of the transaction and observed that \"Satoshi-era miners [tend to] move their Bitcoin at key inflection points.\"\n\nAdding technical context, Sani, the founder of TimechainIndex, confirmed that the funds originated from block rewards mined in 2010. Notably, the blockchain network had rewarded early miners of that era with 50 BTC in block subsidies.\n\nThe coins had remained untouched for more than 15 years across 40 legacy Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses. They were later consolidated and transferred to Coinbase.\n\nTypically, market analysts interpret transfers to centralized exchanges as a prelude to an open-market sale.\n\nMeanwhile, this transaction is not an isolated anomaly but underscores a developing trend of \"vintage\" supply hitting the market.\n\nOver the past year, wallets from the 2009–2011 era have been increasingly reactivated across the Bitcoin network. The activity reflects early holders moving to lock-in gains or update long-standing custody arrangements.\n\nFor context, Galaxy Digital had executed one of the largest crypto sales in history by helping a Satoshi-era investor to sell more than $9 billion in July 2025.\n\nCrucially, the market has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid this selling pressure. Bitcoin successfully absorbed these large-scale \"OG\" supply shocks without suffering a breakdown in market structure.\n\nThis signals that while Bitcoin's early adopters are moving to lock in generational wealth, the market's liquidity remains deep enough to handle their exits.\n\nHowever, despite the immediate sell-side pressure from legacy holders, long-term institutional forecasts remain bullish.\n\nIn a report released last week, asset manager VanEck projected that Bitcoin could reach a theoretical valuation of $2.9 million per coin by 2050. The firm’s thesis relies on the asset’s potential adoption as a global settlement currency.\n\nRead original story Satoshi-Era Miner Moves Millions in Bitcoin After 15 Years of Silence by Oluwapelumi Adejumo at beincrypto.com",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — A guard at a construction site near a 2026 Winter Olympic venue in the mountain resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo died during a frigid overnight shift, authorities confirmed on Saturday.\n\nItaly’s Infrastructure Minister Matteo Salvini called for a full investigation into the circumstances of the 55-year-old worker’s death.\n\nItalian media reported that the death occurred on Thursday while the worker was on duty at a construction site near Cortina’s ice arena. Temperatures that night plunged to minus 12 degrees Celsius (10.4 degrees Fahrenheit.)\n\nMilan Cortina organizers said that the worker died of a heart attack.\n\n“The information we have is that it was a death by natural cause, it was a heart attack. And we are investigating,” Andrea Varnier, CEO of the Fondazione Milano Cortina 2026, told reporters at a test event at the new hockey arena in Milan.\n\n“All the documentation that we have was in order. And we are waiting for the investigation to understand what the specific cause was. At the moment, the information we have from the emergency services is it was a death caused by natural causes ... while he was on site,\" Varnier said.\n\nThe Milan Cortina Winter Olympics are scheduled for Feb. 6-22.\n\nThe construction site was not one overseen by Simico, the governmental company responsible for Olympic infrastructure, the company said in a statement expressing its condolences.\n\nCortina city officials said they were “deeply saddened and troubled by the death.’’\n\nCortina will host curling, sliding and women’s Alpine skiing.",

    "description": "“It was extremely difficult,” IgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan tells Fortune. “But changing minds was harder than adding skills.”",
    "fullText": "Eric Vaughan, CEO of enterprise-software powerhouse IgniteTech, was unwavering as he reflected on the most radical decision of his decades-long career. In early 2023, convinced generative AI was an “existential” transformation, Vaughan looked at his team and saw a workforce not fully on board. His ultimate response: He ripped the company down to the studs, replacing nearly 80% of staff within a year, according to headcount figures reviewed by Fortune.\n\nOver the course of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024, Vaughan told Fortune, IgniteTech replaced hundreds of employees, declining to disclose a specific number. “That was not our goal,” he told Fortune. “It was extremely difficult … But changing minds was harder than adding skills.” It was, by any measure, a brutal reckoning—but Vaughan insists it was necessary, and said he’d do it again.\n\nFor Vaughan, the writing on the wall was clear and dramatic.\n\n“In early 2023, we saw the light,” he told Fortune in an August 2025 interview, adding he believed every tech company was facing a crucial inflection point around adoption of artificial intelligence. “Now I’ve certainly morphed to believe that this is every company, and I mean that literally every company, is facing an existential threat by this transformation.”\n\nWhere others saw promise, Vaughan saw urgency—believing failing to get ahead on AI could doom even the most robust business. He called an all-hands meeting with his global remote team. Gone were the comfortable routines and quarterly goals. Instead, his message was direct: Everything would now revolve around AI. “We’re going to give a gift to each of you. And that gift is tremendous investment of time, tools, education, projects … to give you a new skill,” he explained. The company began reimbursing for AI tools and prompt-engineering classes, and even brought in outside experts to evangelize.\n\n“Every single Monday was called ‘AI Monday,’” Vaughan said, with his mandate for staff that they could work only on AI. “You couldn’t have customer calls; you couldn’t work on budgets; you had to only work on AI projects.” He said this happened across the board, not just for tech workers, but also for sales, marketing, and everybody else at IgniteTech. “That culture needed to be built. That was the key.”\n\nThis was a major investment, he added: 20% of payroll was dedicated to a mass-learning initiative, and it failed because of mass resistance, even sabotage. Belief, Vaughan discovered, is a hard thing to manufacture.",

    "fullText": "Manager Danny Rohl enthused about many aspects of Rangers' controlled 2-0 victory away to Aberdeen, including his side's \"clean sheet mentality\".\n\nA fifth successive victory keeps Rangers three points behind Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts.\n\nSince Rohl took over in October, his side have shipped just eight goals in 14 league games, winning 11 of those, while keeping the opposition out on eight occasions.\n\nRangers kept one just one blank in Russell Martin's seven Premiership games, a soporific Old Firm derby stalemate.\n\n\"We defended until the end and we got a clean sheet,\" Rohl told RangersTV.\n\n\"This is the basis and if we do this again and again we will be in a fantastic way. Keep on the front foot, stay hungry, stay ambitious, and be humble in the right moments.\"\n\nIn the wind and rain at Pittodrie, Aberdeen were limited to five efforts on target, with Jack Butland's only save of note thwarting Leighton Clarkson in the first half.\n\n\"Big, big pride in my group, to come to a really tough place,\" said Rohl in his post-match media conference. \"We showed again different faces, which is what we need.\n\n\"We played good men's football, we were ready in the duels, second balls.\n\n\"We understood when to play in behind, then we understand also to keep the ball in the right areas.\n\n\"The result was enjoyable, of course, it's great to see.\n\n\"We were really focused until the end and it is outstanding what we have done, five wins in a row.\"\n\nRangers solidity is all the more impressive when you consider first choice centre-backs John Souttar and Derek Cornelius have been missing.\n\nThe Canada international has been out since early November, while Souttar was absent for six matches.\n\nHowever, it is no surprise that the Scotland defender's return coincides with the current five-game winning run.\n\nSouttar made a great early block from Nicolas Milanovic at Pittodrie and was constantly marshalling the backline, keeping the occasionally errant Emmanuel Fernandez close and focused.\n\nFernandez may be prone to the odd lapse but the 24-year-old, who was playing in England's League One last season, is an imposing figure.\n\nHe has four goals from his run of 11 successive starts and was denied another by a debatable VAR review in Aberdeen.\n\nA menace at set-pieces in the opposition box, he is handy at nodding them away at the other end too, and Nasser Djiga is likely to have to wait patiently on the bench now that he is back from the Africa Cup of Nations with Burkina Faso.",

    "description": "Also: advice to reduce screen time, how to maximize your toaster oven, the best gloves and at-home fitness...",
    "fullText": "Also: advice to reduce screen time, how to maximize your toaster oven, the best gloves and at-home fitness staples\n\nThis piece was originally published in the Filter US newsletter on buying fewer, better things. \nEach week we cut through the noise to bring you smart, practical recommendations on how to live better – from what is worth buying to the tools, habits and ideas that actually last.\n\nAt this time last year, I was a full-time student, throwing on the requisite leggings and an oversized sweatshirt for evening classes and late-night library sessions. This year, I’ve joined countless others in office life, zipping in and out of conference rooms and hopping on video calls for interviews and meetings. I love any excuse to shop, but many office-friendly pieces, including pricey blazers and crisp button-downs, are far outside my price range.\n\nBut perhaps my work wardrobe doesn’t have to break the bank.\n\nRecently, we wrote about how the New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, pulled off the budget-friendly suits he sported throughout his campaign. And that inspired me to search for affordable ways to build my office wardrobe.\n\nRead the full story here: How Mamdani makes affordable suits look expensive – and you can too\n\nSo I asked wardrobe stylist Samantha Elise how we can get dressed for the office without racking up a hefty credit card bill, sending us back to the 80s or sacrificing personal style.\n\nThe 27 best fashion gifts in the US – curated by our favorite stylists and creators\n\nEight winter clothing essentials Scandinavians swear by – from heated socks to ‘allværsjakke’\n\nI don’t have a full-length mirror in my apartment, so I put Elise’s advice to the test in a dressing room near the Guardian’s New York City office (as you can see in the image above).\n\nWe’ve all been tempted by a cheap pair of pants or a T-shirt that costs less than a cup of coffee – even as we know the devastating environmental costs of fast fashion. Elise says we should spend a bit more on wardrobe basics, such as a black pair of pants or a trenchcoat.\n\n“Pieces that you can pare everything back to are what I would invest in, because that’s what’s creating that reliable foundation in your closet,” Elise said.\n\nShe says the best way to identify high-quality pieces is to touch the items. “Nine times out 10, the feeling alone lets you know the quality. I know I’ve come across good denim when it feels thick and sturdy.”\n\nBrands like Aritzia and Madewell are a few of Elise’s go-tos for well-made basics. (We checked, and they both have straightforward return policies if you’re planning to do the touch test at home.) For those of us lucky enough to be able to wear jeans to work, she recommended Citizens of Humanity and Agolde for higher-quality denim.\n\nWhen I think of office attire, I can’t help but picture drab pencil skirts and plenty of beige. But even on a budget, there are strategies that can elevate your ensemble while remaining professional.\n\n“Find elements that feel true to yourself, like a pattern or a pop of color,” Elise said. She also advised experimenting with different silhouettes, such as white tees that hit below your elbow or a pair of balloon pants.\n\nBuy statement pieces second-hand\n\n“Go on Depop and find something for $20 versus spending $400 on a designer [striped shirt]. All stripes look the same. Let’s not waste money there, because then you have the striped shirt and no pants to wear it with,” Elise said.\n\nShop your closet with fresh eyes\n\nElise advised finding inspiration to breathe new life into what you already own. She uses Pinterest as a starting point to build her outfits.\n\n“There’s a lot of second-guessing when it comes to [putting together outfits]. You have more answers than you think you do. So trust yourself and be creative,” she said.\n\nAnd for a wallet-friendly way to spice up an office outfit, Elise recommended playing with layering, such as tying a sweater over your shoulders or a blazer around your waist.\n\nAre you trying to put an end to your nightly doom scroll? We’ve shared a few unique tips for cutting down on the amount of time you spend staring at a screen, brought to you by experts.\n\nFrom going analog to writing a breakup letter to your phone, we gathered some unconventional tips that go beyond setting time limits or silencing your device.\n\nRead the full story here: ‘Put a rubber band on your phone’: I asked experts how to reduce screen time – here’s what they said\n\nGorpcore is having a moment. And winter gloves are very much a part of it.\n\nFilter US editor Nick Mokey shared the military surplus-style glove combination that he swears by for everything from camping to biking. The best part? They’re far more affordable (and probably warmer) than the fancy designer pair you’ve been eyeing.\n\nRead the full story here: The best winter gloves are two pairs, actually (and one is hiding at Home Depot)\n\nPro chef Kiki Aranita wants you to use your toaster oven for more than making toast.\n\nBreville Joule Oven Air Fryer Pro\n\nFrom cooking up an impressive batch of air-fried crispy noodles for your next dinner party to pretending it’s summer and making s’mores from the comfort of your kitchen, the toaster oven is a true kitchen multitasker.\n\nRead her tips here: From eggs to s’mores: 10 foods you didn’t know your toaster oven could make\n\nIf you’re put off by burpees on your hardwood floor or sun salutations in your garage, we’re here to tell you there’s a better way to get an at-home workout.\n\nTo help find the best products to revamp your 2026 fitness routine (without leaving the comfort of your house), we asked personal trainer Marissa Miller to outline a few of her favorites, including a durable Lululemon yoga mat and a lower-intensity alternative to weight lifting.\n\nRead the full story here: A personal trainer’s starter pack: 10 US workout products to reboot for 2026",

    "fullText": "From being branded an \"idiot\" to scoring a hat-trick, Gabriel Martinell's name has been in the headlines over the past few days.\n\nThe Arsenal winger was heavily criticised for trying to push the injured Conor Bradley off the pitch in the closing stages of Arsenal's 0-0 draw with Liverpool on Thursday, something he apologised for on social media.\n\nBut the 24-year-old's first hat-trick for Arsenal - as they came from behind to beat Championship outfit Portsmouth and reach the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday - showed \"personality\", according to his boss.\n\n\"It's part of football and then it's how you take it,\" Mikel Arteta when asked how Martinelli has dealt with being the subject of so much discussion.\n\n\"But he knew inside the reason why he did what he did.\"\n\nArteta also praised Liverpool boss Arne Slot for his considered response to the incident, when he defended the Brazilian.\n\n\"I think Arne Slot spoke brilliantly after the game - speaking of your opponent in the manner that he explained the situation and the fact that Gabi had no intention whatsoever to damage any player,\" added Arteta.\n\n\"That's personality. Come in and talk on the pitch, which is the best part of it.\"\n\nMartinelli has had a mixed season, losing his starting place in the Premier League to Leandro Trossard after a drop in form and confidence.\n\nHe has started just six times for the Gunners, who are six points clear at the top of the table.\n\nHowever, the winger has been a key player this season for Arsenal in Champions League, scoring five goals in as many appearances. And after his hat-trick against Portsmouth, he is now his side's top scorer.\n\n\"That's why to play for a big club, you need a big personality because it can be bad... it can be an action that you miss, it can be something that costs you a game,\" Arteta added\n\n\"And three days later, there is a game. So you need to lift yourself up and make it count.\n\n\"I love it. Gabi, in every context that you throw him in, he plays, he doesn't play. He performs well, not well. Today, he scored three goals.\n\n\"Tomorrow, he's going to train 100 miles an hour, for sure. He's not going to change that. And that's Gabi.\"",

    "fullText": "Tries: Segun 2, T Willis Con: Burke Pen: Farrell\n\nTries: Kinghorn, Lebel Cons: Ramos 2\n\nSaracens produced an outstanding performance in testing conditions to beat Toulouse 20-14 and all but secure their place in the last 16 of the Champions Cup.\n\nThey held a blunt review of their stuttering season after a poor defeat at Leicester last weekend, saying they had \"confronted what was wrong\" and were ready to \"do the talking on the field\" against the six-time European champions.\n\nMark McCall's side did just that at a wet and windy StoneX, fronting up to the star-studded Toulouse side with their best display of the season.\n\nNumber eight Tom Willis, whose elder brother Jack was in Toulouse's back row, gave another stellar performance to underline how much he will be missed when he moves to Bordeaux at the end of the season.\n\nRotimi Segun scored two of their tries and man of the match Willis bagged the other as Saracens scored 17 unanswered first-half points to take control of the match.\n\n\"A lot of people thought we were going to lose that game and probably rightly so because of some of our performances so far this season,\" said captain Maro Itoje.\n\n\"The challenge for us now is to make sure we're consistent. We're not saying that we're going to win every game, but the fight and the mentality needs to be consistent.\n\n\"For me, it actually wasn't really about the result. It was about the character of the team and how we were going to show up.\"\n\nChampions Cup key moments and qualification stakes\n\nRelive Sunday's Champions Cup action as it happened\n\nThings looked ominous when Toulouse fly-half Blair Kinghorn scored the opening try following sustained pressure, but Saracens responded with three tries in 10 minutes.\n\nThe first came when Samoan flanker Theo McFarland charged down Antoine Dupont's kick and raced forward to gather the ball. Jamie George and Willis took over the charge before the ball was eventually moved left to Segun to finish.\n\nThree-time champions Saracens almost scored again moments later. Fly-half Fergus Burke produced a brilliant burst of speed and sent an enticing kick through only for Alex Lozowski to fumble the bouncing ball as he dived over the line.\n\nLozowski, making his comeback from an Achilles tendon injury, made amends with an outrageous dummy pass that released Segun, who raced past his marker to score his second.\n\nSaracens forwards struggled early on against the huge Toulouse pack, but with the momentum now in their favour the hosts surged towards the line again. Willis stretched over, letting out a massive roar as he rose to his feet having helped his side secure a healthy 17-7 lead.\n\nToulouse scored early in the second half through wing Matthis Lebel but with conditions deteriorating rapidly, and their captain Dupont strangely quiet, that was their last score of the game.\n\nWillis made a crucial turnover to prevent a possible try but otherwise the French league leaders lacked any sort of fluency in attack.\n\nOwen Farrell and Ben Earl came on to lend their experience, and the former England captain stretched the lead to six points with a penalty.\n\nSaracens held on without any major scares to secure a famous win - and bragging rights for Tom over his brother Jack.\n\n\"Tom is a massive player for us,\" added Itoje. \"He's a great ball-carrier. He's probably the most awkward ball-carrier I've seen.\n\n\"He finds a way to go forward off a standing start and he can just wriggle his body, wriggle his hips through contact. He was fantastic.\n\n\"Both Willises played well but I'll give it by just a slight nudge to Tom.\"\n\nTom said it had been \"a bit of a weird and emotional day\" playing against his brother.\n\n\"He banged me early on, I knew he was dialled in for it,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"He's a brilliant player and caused us havoc at the breakdown as always.\n\n\"I saw him on Friday and Saturday but a few hours before kick-off he went a bit quiet. I tried to wind him up but it didn't work.\"\n\nSarries will bid for the top spot in Pool 1 when they face group leaders Glasgow Warriors away next Sunday, but a losing bonus point would be enough to guarantee their progress to the knockout stage.\n\nToulouse have now lost two group games, having been humbled 28-21 by Glasgow in December, and head into their final match at Sale on Saturday potentially needing to win to go through.\n\nBordeaux thump Northampton in Champions Cup repeat\n\nDavid hat-trick seals Harlequins knockout spot\n\nSaracens: Daly; Caluori, Lozowski, Hartley, Segun; Burke, Van Zyl; Mawi, George, Street, Itoje (capt), Tizard, McFarland, Gonzalez, Willis.\n\nReplacements: Hadfield, Carre, Riccioni, Onyeama-Christie,Earl, Bracken, Farrell, Malins.\n\nToulouse: Ramos; Delibes, Costes, Chocobares, Lebel; Kinghorn, Dupont (capt); Ainu'u, Marchand, Aldegheri, Flament, Meafou, Willis, Jelonch, Roumat.\n\nReplacements: Mauvaka, Bertrand, Mallez, Brennan, Elias, Banos, Graou, Vigneres.\n\nAssistant referees: Ru Campbell (Sco), Federico Vedovelli (Ita)",

    "fullText": "Life moves fast at Manchester United.\n\nWhen Brighton last visited Old Trafford 11 weeks ago, a third successive win seemed to be a clear sign of a corner being turned under Ruben Amorim.\n\nWind forward to the present day.\n\nThe grey clouds enveloped Old Trafford and the rain fell during Sunday's FA Cup third-round defeat by Brighton. It was a fitting metaphor.\n\nAmorim is gone, United have fallen at the first hurdle in both domestic cup competitions for the first time since 1981-82. They are condemned to a 40-game season, the fewest they have played since 1914-15.\n\nThe world's oldest person, 116-year-old Ethel Caterham, was five at the time, so even she probably doesn't remember it.\n\nAfter a two-game trip to Asia at the end of last season to plug a financial hole, now the mooted mid-season trip to Saudi Arabia has to become more likely - as there is a 10-day window in United's season in February and March, given the FA Cup fourth and fifth round weekends are, for them, blank.\n\nBefore that, United host Manchester City next Saturday with no manager in place to lift their \"fragile\" confidence.\n\nThey have one win in seven games, a fortunate triumph against Newcastle on 26 December.\n\nOut of 13 matches since the previous Brighton visit, they have enjoyed three victories.\n\nWhile their current position of seventh in the Premier League is not catastrophic, if results against Manchester City and Arsenal go to form, they could be firmly in the bottom half of the table by the time they entertain Fulham on 1 February, when the 1958 Group of supporters plan a mass demonstration against the ownership.",
