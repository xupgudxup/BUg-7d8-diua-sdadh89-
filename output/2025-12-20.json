The YouTuber-turned-boxer underwent successful surgery Saturday morning to repair the broken jaw he suffered in Friday night's Netflix boxing match against Anthony Joshua.\n\nJoshua, an Olympic champion and former two-time unified heavyweight titleholder, brutally knocked Paul out with a straight right hand in the sixth round of their heavyweight bout at Miami's Kaseya Center. Joshua knocked Paul down four times en route to the fight-ending sequence, dominating a bizarre and lopsided mismatch while out-landing the American 48 punches to just 16.\n\nPaul was hospitalized immediately after the bout and later posted x-rays showing his jaw broken in two places.\n\nDouble broken jaw.

    "title": "2025 Northwestern Football Know Your Opponent: Central Michigan Chippewas",
    "description": "It’s almost bowling time for the Wildcats.",
    "fullText": "It’s been a while since I wrote one of these (the previous one was posted on Aug. 23). However, Northwestern football has a 13th game on its schedule, the Mid-American Conference’s Central Michigan Chippewas. As the two teams are set to face each other at Ford Field in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Friday, Dec. 26 at 12 p.m. CST for the first time since Northwestern’s 30-25 win on Sept. 25, 2010 (the only ever matchup between the two squads). The Chippewas finished the season at 7-5, but are currently 10.5-point underdogs against the ‘Cats. Here’s everything to know about CMU:\n\nHead Coach: Matt Drinkall (first season)\n\nIn Coach Drinkall’s first season at the helm, the Chippewas finished at a respectable and promising 7-5 after three straight losing seasons. While they didn’t play for the MAC title, they still finished with the fifth-best conference record behind Western Michigan, Ohio, Toledo and Miami (OH). CMU started the season with a 16-14 win over San Jose State before losing its next two games to its Power Four opponents in Pitt and Michigan. The Chippewas followed that game by beating FCS school Wagner before winning their first conference game of the season over Eastern Michigan. After losing the following week to Akron, CMU took down Bowling Green (to snap a 10-game road losing streak) and UMass. The Chippewas then lost their next game to the eventual MAC champions (Western Michigan) by just three points, before defeating Buffalo and Kent State. They did lose to Toledo in their final game of the season, but for a first-year head coach, 7-5 isn’t too shabby.\n\nRedshirt senior quarterback Joe Labas started all games for CMU in 2025. He led the Chippewas in passing, going 126-of-183 passing for 1,676 yards, 12 touchdowns and six interceptions. In all but Week 1, CMU won by more than one possession in its victories. Additionally, two of the Chippewas’ three conference losses were by just one possession. In other words, Labas did his job despite not popping off the stat sheet. In addition to Labas playing quarterback, junior Angel Flores made his fair share of appearances. In eight games, Flores completed just 18 of his 27 passes. What he was used for was running the ball. Among MAC quarterbacks, Flores was fourth in rushing yards with 519 and tied for second in rushing touchdowns with eight. He did miss the final four games of the season with an injury he suffered against UMass, and his status is in question for the bowl game right now.\n\nApart from Flores, CMU had a variety of running backs perform. Finishing two spots ahead of Northwestern with the 58th most rushing yards per game (169.5), the Chippewas saw major production on the ground from three guys not named Flores. Nahree Biggins was the lead back, as he turned 105 carries into 540 yards and two touchdowns. In addition to his rushing, Biggins caught 19 passes for 185 yards and a touchdown. Coming in at the third leading rusher on the team behind Biggins and Flores is Trey Cornist, who rushed for 404 yards and a touchdown in his 94 carries. Unlike Biggins, Cornist didn’t catch a single pass. Brock Townsend was the third running back to rush for over 300 yards for the Chippewas. Townsend’s four rushing touchdowns led his team outside of Flores, as he rushed for 394 yards on just 75 carries. He was also featured in the receiving game, catching 12 passes for 142 yards and three touchdowns. Utilizing the running backs will almost certainly be a focus for CMU.\n\nIn terms of receiving, Langston Lewis and Tommy McIntosh were the two main targets. Lewis hauled in 35 passes for 513 yards and three touchdowns, while McIntosh caught 27 balls for 401 yards and three touchdowns. Lewis was also named to the 2025 All-Mac Third Team Offense. Tyson Davis followed behind with 20 receptions himself for 270 yards and two scores. The fourth and fifth leading receivers were Biggins and Townsend, followed by tight end DeCorion Temple, who caught 15 passes for 131 yards and two touchdowns. No other player for the Chippewas caught 10 or more passes, nor eclipsed 100 yards receiving.\n\nCMU’s offensive line isn’t anything super special. The Chippewas unit up front finished as the second-lowest PFF graded pass blocking unit in not only the MAC, but also in the entire country, with a 30.8 PFF pass blocking grade. They didn’t fare too much better in run blocking, as they finished the regular season as the fourth-lowest in their conference with a 57.7 PFF run blocking grade. The O-line did allow 19 sacks, which was around the middle of the pack in terms of sacks allowed. Nonetheless, the offensive weakness of the Chippewas is their blocking.\n\nNow it’s time to look at the defense for CMU. Starting with the defensive line, the first name to mention is Michael Heldman. He finished the season with 10.5 sacks, tied for the 10th most in the country. Apart from his ability to bring down opposing quarterbacks, Heldman had 47 total tackles (24 solo, 23 assists) and two forced fumbles, earning him a spot on the 2025 All-MAC First Team Defense. Behind Heldman, the next closest player in sacks for the Chippewas was Korver Demma with 3.5. He had 27 total tackles, the second most on his team of the defensive linemen, while also forcing a fumble. Keyshawn Hayden had a single sack this season, but he graded out as the second-best pass rusher on CMU per PFF behind Heldman.\n\nHeldman is one of two stars on this Chippewa defense. The other is linebacker Jordan Kwiatkowski. The senior finished the season with 109 total tackles (49 solo, 60 assists) as listed on the Central Michigan website, which ties him with NU’s Robert Fitzgerald in tackles. ESPN has Kwiatkowski at 105 total tackles (48 solo, 57 assists). Nonetheless, Kwiatkowski was making tackles all over the field to go along with three sacks, three interceptions and three forced fumbles, garnering him a spot alongside Heldman on the 2025 All-MAC First Team Defense. Dakota Cochran was second on CMU in tackles with 77 (40 solo, 37 assists). The redshirt senior also had 0.5 sacks, an interception, two forced fumbles and a blocked kick. He was named to the 2025 All-MAC Second Team Defense. Kwiatkowski and Cochran are the two main guys at linebacker for the Chippewas. Between them, they scored three touchdowns: Kwiatkowski with a pick six, Cochran with a pick six and a fumble return.\n\n1Q, 3:47 | Heldman with the breakup, JK takes it 48 yds to the house! pic.twitter.com/LRf3Jb4xiP\n\n— Central Michigan Football (@CMU_Football) November 13, 2025\n\nQ4, 10:38 | Dakota Cochran with his second career touchdown on the strip sack by Korver Demma! pic.twitter.com/Ms09HM7qut\n\n— Central Michigan Football (@CMU_Football) November 13, 2025\n\nNow onto the secondary. Caleb Spann led CMU’s defensive backs in tackles with 48, finishing third on the team in that statistic. The redshirt senior also had one interception in 2025. Kalen Carroll finished tied for fourth on his team in tackles with 47 per the CMU website, while also forcing a fumble and intercepting a pass this season. He was the highest graded player in pass coverage for the Chippewas, per PFF, for players with 50 or more coverage snaps. Elijah Gordon was also a big contributor in the secondary, as he finished the season with 46 tackles and an interception. As a unit, CMU allowed 207.2 passing yards per game, putting them around the middle of the FBS.",

    "description": "Two decades after winning it all with defense and belief, Brian Billick recognizes the same mindset taking shape in Houston and history suggests that kind of formula does not stay quiet for long.",
    "fullText": "Brian Billick explains why Houston’s defense feels championship ready originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere are moments in the NFL when history doesn’t repeat itself so much as it clears its throat.\n\nThat is where the modern-day Houston Texans now stand. Not chasing ghosts. Not recreating something old. But quietly echoing a formula that once carried the Baltimore Ravens from uncertainty to a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThe comparison is not built on nostalgia. It is built on structure.\n\nIn 2000, Baltimore won a Super Bowl with a defense that did not negotiate. It dictated. The Ravens entered the postseason as a wild card, survived a rocky stretch during the regular season, then caught fire when it mattered most. Seven straight wins to close the year. Three playoff victories that never felt competitive. A Super Bowl performance that removed all doubt.\n\nMORE: Shedeur Sanders ‘that’s on me’ after throwing three interceptions in loss to Bears\n\nHouston’s path has followed a familiar rhythm.\n\nThe Texans stumbled early, dropping three straight games and digging a hole that invited skepticism. The response was not panic. It was correction. Since then, Houston has ripped off six consecutive wins, with a seventh looming, and done it the same way Baltimore once did. By shrinking space. By tackling cleanly. By turning every possession into work.\n\nBack then, Brian Billick was only in his second season as a head coach. Today, DeMeco Ryans is in his third, presiding over a team that has discovered exactly who it is and why that matters.\n\nWhen asked by Sporting News about the resemblance, Billick didn’t reach for nostalgia. He went straight to mindset.\n\n“Our defense just had a mindset that went beyond their physical skills. What made them so great was their ability to tackle in the open field, you just didn’t get yards after contact in the open field, and you didn’t get big plays. We believed we could win a championship based upon that defense and keep in mind, that was at a time when the league was transitioning out of the Elway’s, Marino’s and Montana’s. We had a defensive based championship, just as Tampa and New England had the following seasons.”\n\nThat belief is the connective tissue.\n\nHouston’s defense does not rely on spectacle. It relies on discipline. Explosive plays are rare. Yards after contact are earned, not given. Opponents leave possessions feeling squeezed, frustrated, and behind schedule. That is not coincidence. That is identity.\n\nThe league has changed since 2000. The quarterbacks are bigger brands. The rules favor offense. The margins feel thinner. Yet the core truth remains unchanged. Defense still travels. Defense still stabilizes. Defense still gives teams permission to believe when everything tightens.\n\nBillick was also asked about winning a championship early in his tenure, something that once felt like an exception and now feels like an expectation.\n\n“You can win it all early at a place because of free agency and if you draft well. That’s honestly the expectation these days, win quickly and often.”\n\nThat statement feels almost prophetic in the modern NFL. Windows are no longer slow burns. They open suddenly. They close faster. Houston understands that.\n\nThis Texans team is not a finished product. Neither were the 2000 Ravens in September. What matters is not how they look in isolation, but how they are trending when games stop forgiving mistakes.\n\nHouston is not trying to become the 2000 Ravens. But the structure is there. The timing is there. And the defense is beginning to speak with the same authority.\n\nHistory is not calling them champions yet.\n\nKane Wommack says Alabama’s culture showed itself when the punches came\n\nThree Clemson defenders projected as first round picks in latest CBS Sports NFL mock draft\n\nWarren Sapp trends for all the wrong reasons as Colorado’s defensive line erodes amid mass exodus",

Defensively so good in many aspects, aggression. But with the ball we are still away from what we have to do.\n\n\"They had chances because our spots to play were not good. This is the problem. It was quite similar to Leeds. They have quality - [Lucas] Paqueta, [Crysencio] Summerville - we were in dangerous positions. We were not in the right spots with the ball. Still we're not brave enough to break the lines and do it. But I'm really happy about position in the table, we are close to the top of the league, Champions League we are there, Carabao Cup semis. We are missing seven players now - five injured, two AFCON - that is tough to handle for many games. But we have to improve.\"\n\nOn Erling Haaland: \"The goals, he scores a lot for us, but today I have to thank him for the intensity. Him, Phil Foden and Nico O'Reilly they helped us a lot with the intensity.\"\n\nMidfielder Tijjani Reijnders, speaking to BBC's Match of the Day:\n\n\"Only the beginning of the second half we didn't start quite so well. Big part of the game we controlled it and we could have made more chances if we were more secure in certain situations.\"\n\nOn settling in at the club: \"It's new, I think, for every player who comes here. The tactics are different from my other clubs; the guys help me a lot with adjusting, and I feel pretty settled here.\n\n\"It's good. We put on a very good streak. For us, we have to keep going.

    "fullText": "Padres get C+ grade for $75 million 'player-friendly' Michael King signing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Diego Padres have had an interesting offseason so far, and only two major moves have been made. Sung-mun Song was signed to a small three-year deal to play second base, and Michael King signed a huge $75 million deal to join the rotation.\n\nWhile the Padres desperately needed starting pitching, and got it in King on a fairly reasonable deal from the outside looking in, there's a bit more to this three-year deal than meets the eye.\n\nAs ESPN analyst Bradford Doolittle points out, amid a C+ grade of the signing for the Padres, the \"player-friendly\" nature of this contract is what causes this deal to be viewed less favorably from the Padres' perspective.\n\n\"The structure of the deal makes this very much a player-friendly pact,\" Doolittle writes, \"and since we grade these things from the perspective of the team, it drags down the grade a bit.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old starter was given a $75 million deal over three seasons, but the player-friendly aspect of this new contract is a big difference between a higher grade and the C+ that Doolittle handed out to the Padres.\n\nFor the first season of this new contract, King will reportedly make $22 million. It's a respectable amount, but not too outlandish for the Padres to spend on King for one season.\n\nThe issue comes up after that. King then has two opt-outs, one after the 2026 season and another after the 2027 season, which could allow the starter to hit free agency.\n\nThere's only one scenario where he hits the open market again: if he has a strong 2026 season and believes he can land a new, long-term extension.\n\nMore: Padres have $60 million reason to trade All-Star versatile infielder\n\nSan Diego might wind up losing King after just one season if the right-hander plays well. But if he struggles, then King will opt in and be on the Padres' books for a strong total in 2027. If he struggles again, then he could opt in one more time to further complicate things.\n\nIf King decides to opt in for the final two seasons of this deal, then he will get an average of $26.5 million over the 2027 and 2028 seasons. For a starter who, if he opts in, would be struggling, that's a tough contract to deal with.\n\nThe Padres might need to find a trade for King if he struggles in 2026 and 2027, but his struggles and lofty contract would make things even more troublesome going into the future.\n\nKing's $75 million contract is a very player-friendly one, and while that was how the Padres were able to bring King back, it could hurt them in a big way down the road. That's why, despite the signing being a good one, the Padres received just a C+ grade from Doolittle.\n\nPadres star Yu Darvish out for 2026 after elbow repair and internal brace\n\nPadres' Jake Cronenworth gets trade update from ESPN insiders\n\nEthan Salas floated in trade rumors as Padres have moves to make in offseason\n\nFormer GM believes a reunion could be in order for the Padres this winter\n\nPadres reporter lists two prospects that fans will want to pay attention to",

    "title": "Jets vs Saints: Five Questions with Canal Street Chronicles",
    "description": "The Jets seek to halt a rough stretch when the visit the New Orleans Saints on Sunday",
    "fullText": "The New York Jets are on the road on Sunday for the 15th game of their 2025 campaign. They will be facing the New Orleans Saints. The Saints are just 4-10 on the year, but they have turned their season around a bit recently. With rookie quarterback Tyler Shough inserted into the lineup the Saints have won three of their last six games.\n\nPreviewing this matchup, Nic Jennings at Canal Street Chronicles was kind enough to answer a few questions regarding the 2025 New Orleans Saints.\n\n1. The Saints have been searching for the right quarterback since Drew Brees left after the 2020 season. How has rookie Tyler Shough looked so far this season, do you think he may be a long term answer at quarterback, and do you expect the Saints to draft a quarterback with an early round pick in 2026?\n\nTyler Shough has been exceeding expectations and improving by the week, showing more than enough promise to have fans excited for the future and to believe there is finally a light at the end of the tunnel at the quarterback position in the post-Brees era.\n\nShough holds a 3–1 record against the NFC South and is 3–3 as a starter—the most wins by any rookie quarterback—while the Saints have won back-to-back games and three of their last five. There’s still plenty of room for development, but the rookie has at least earned the opportunity to start for the Saints in 2026 and continues to strengthen my belief that New Orleans should pass on a quarterback in the upcoming NFL draft.\n\n2. How would you attack the Saints on offense and on defense?\n\nOn offense, the Jets should be licking their chops looking at the interior of the Saints’ offensive line. With Erik McCoy out for the season with a torn bicep, Luke Fortner has been starting at center and his penalties have set the offense back. Fortner had two penalties in the first half against the Panthers on Sunday. At right guard, Cesar Ruiz, who the Saints gave a four-year, $44 million deal in 2023, has been borderline unplayable due to his poor play, while Dillon Radunz has been holding up okay at left guard. Ruiz has not practiced this week as he nurses an ankle injury, meaning the Saints could be forced to roll out William Sherman. It should not be difficult for New York to break through the interior or force penalties.\n\nOn defense, the Saints still aren’t great at stopping the run and have had trouble getting off the field on third-and-long situations. Bryce Young was able to hurt New Orleans with his legs on third down. They have, however, figured out their short-yardage defense as they continue to stuff teams at the line of scrimmage. But in all honesty, Brandon Staley has his defense playing lights out during this final stretch.\n\n3. Which players, if any, are guys who the casual NFL fan may be unfamiliar with but Saints fans know can make a difference in the game?\n\nWell, had this been last week, I would have said second-year wideout Devaughn Vele or rookie running back Devin Neal, who have been developing into playmakers for the offense and reliable safety valves for Tyler Shough. However, both were ruled out early in the week, with Vele nursing a shoulder injury and Neal dealing with a hamstring injury suffered against Carolina.\n\nFor this game, I’m going with a player who has put together an impressive rookie season: fourth-round cornerback Quincy Riley.\n\nRiley earned his opportunity to start earlier in the season when Isaac Yiadom went down with an injury, and he’s never looked back. He has elite ball skills and has proven he can lock down the opposite side of the field from Kool-Aid McKinstry. Along with fellow rookie and third-round safety Jonas Sanker, Riley has helped bolster a Saints secondary that many entered the season viewing as a weakness.\n\n4.  The Jets are the best in at least one thing: not making the playoffs. They have failed to do so for 15 straight seasons. The Saints share a little of this pain, missing the playoffs for five straight seasons. How far away is this Saints team from returning to the playoffs, and what will the Saints need to do in terms of their roster and their coaching staff to get there?\n\nI’d say around three to five years until the Saints can at least return to being a contender. I have the utmost confidence in Tyler Shough and Kellen Moore, but this roster lacks youth and talent. With a couple more strong draft classes, I wouldn’t be surprised to see things start trending in the right direction for New Orleans.\n\n5. Which team wins this game and why?\n\nI think I’m going to be optimistic and take the Saints to win their third straight game. Tyler Shough has shown that he can elevate a supporting cast with limited playmakers, and the Saints defense is on a roll at the moment. I’ll take New Orleans 24–10.",

    "fullText": "Well folks, today’s the day that the Iowa Women’s Basketball team finds out what they’re really made of. The Hawkeyes face an extremely daunting challenge: the reigning national champion, No. 1 ranked UConn Huskies on a neutral court in Brooklyn as both teams once again participate in the Champions Classic.\n\nTo say this game would be an uphill climb was an understatement, and that was before the Huskies went to the west coast and absolutely dominated the hosting USC Trojans in a game that was the best example yet that the champs are still the team to beat this season.\n\nIn comes Iowa, on the heels of a 1-1 stretch that featured a brutal loss on the road to the Iowa State Cyclones, and a small controversy with sophomore Emely Rodriguez indefinitely suspended from the team and not making the trip to New York. Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but I’d imagine the bulk of her minutes get split between some combination of Taylor Stremlow, Addie Deal and the newly returned Teagan Mallegni. Freshman Journey Houston, who looks like an absolute steal from the Class of 2025, should also see her role continue to increase.\n\nBeing realistic here, coming back to Iowa City with a victory will pretty much require an absolutely perfect performance from every Hawkeye who sees the court, and an off day for Sarah Strong or Azzi Fudd. You play the games for a reason, but I’m not feeling great about this one!\n\nAt the same time, this is the kind of game you love to see a program seeking to cement its status in the upper tier of college basketball schedule. Iowa is a young team. UConn is not. This game is a gauge for how far Iowa has come, and how far it still has to go to be among the elites.\n\nLet’s just hope they can keep things close for the majority of the game.\n\nDate: December 20, 2025\nTime: 12:30 p.m. CST\nMatchup: No. 11 Iowa Hawkeyes vs No. 1 UConn Huskies \nLocation: Barclays Center – Brooklyn, NY \nTV: FOX\n\nI unfortunately have a family holiday party conflicting with the game today but I still should be around in the comments a bit here.

    "fullText": "The Atlanta Falcons are waiving kick returner Jamal Agnew and signing cornerback C.J. Henderson to their 53-man roster, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported. Agnew lost his starting job after fumbling during the team's Week 13 loss to the New York Jets.\n\nLast week, the veteran return man was a healthy scratch in the Falcons' win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Wide receiver Deven Thompkins took over kick return duties and will likely continue in that role for the final three games of the season.\n\nHenderson, a former top-10 pick, has spent most of the season on Atlanta's practice squad. The Jacksonville Jaguars originally drafted Henderson with the ninth overall pick in 2020 but traded him to the Carolina Panthers early in the 2021 season.\n\nThe former Florida Gators cornerback has appeared in 49 career games (32 starts), recording 172 tackles (139 solo), 16 passes defended and three interceptions. Henderson can help add depth in the secondary with Mike Hughes ruled out for Sunday's game.\n\nCheck out the Falcons' updated 53-man roster and practice squad entering Week 16 below.\n\nOL Ryan Hayes (practice squad IR)\n\nThe Falcons will face the Arizona Cardinals on the road in Week 16. Sunday's game starts at 4:05 p.m. ET at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Falcons Wire: Atlanta Falcons cut Jamal Agnew, sign CJ Henderson",

A member of Doherty’s entourage exchanges words with Arlovski, and then throws a punch, prompting “The Pitbull” to return fire. Multiple other members of the entourage then try to attack Arlovski, who tosses one to the ground and kicks him, before throwing punches at the others until they retreat.\n\nFor his part, Doherty attempts to play peacemaker, repeatedly telling his compatriots to “chill,” to little avail. The brawl dissipates quickly as others intervene, and Arlovski is escorted off and into an elevator, while Doherty’s friends keep talking trash and giving Arlovski the finger.\n\nYou can watch multiple angles of the altercation below.\n\nJack Doherty gets his friends beat up by Andrei Arlovski for bumping into him after the Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua fight. pic.twitter.com/NJXnWJkm84\n\n— Don’t Suspend Me (@__OnlyTruth_) December 20, 2025\n\nThe fight after the fight ft @AndreiArlovski & @dohertyjackk pic.twitter.com/Ovadcu0taM\n\n— VNTV (@violentnoise_) December 20, 2025\n\nArlovski left the UFC in 2024 on a four-fight losing streak.

    "description": "Rohit Ponnaiya breaks down his favorite Week 16 NFL player props, including Jacoby Brissett and Aaron Rodgers.",
    "fullText": "It's going to be a Blue Christmas for Tua Tagovailoa, who has been benched by the Dolphins. With Miami breaking in a rookie QB, my NFL props are betting on RB De'Von Achane to carry the offense.\n\nSee why I'm backing Achane, Jacoby Brissett, and Aaron Rodgers with my favorite NFL player props for Week 16 in the NFL.\n\nKyler Murray who? Jacoby Brissett gone over his passing yards total in all nine of his starts this season. He has thrown the ball at least 40 times in six straight contests, averaging a whopping 45.7 pass attempts per game over that span.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have struggled to run the ball and have practically abandoned that part of their offense. They are second in the NFL in passing play percentage (65.4%), with that number ballooning to 72.5% over the last six weeks.\n\nThe Cardinals are hosting the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday in a beautiful 76-degree day at State Farm Stadium. That should lead to plenty of throwing from a pair of teams with nothing to play for except pride.\n\nWith the Miami Dolphins starting seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers at QB expect them to lean on their rushing attack against a piss-poor Bengals run defense. Cincinnati is 30th in the NFL in defensive rush EPA and allows a league-high 157.9 rushing yards per game.\n\nEven if the Bengals sell out to stop the run, they won't be able to contain Achane. They allow 5.0 yards per carry when stacking the box, and De'Von Achane averages 5.8 yards per attempt when running against a stacked box.\n\nAchane is coming off a game where he was limited to 60 yards on 12 carries due to a negative game script. However, he had rushed for more than 90 yards in his previous four contests, averaging 130.0 rushing yards per game over that span.\n\nAaron Rodgers is coming off back-to-back contests where he completed 23 passes in wins against the Dolphins and Ravens. The four-time MVP is proving that he still has something left in the tank, and he faces a struggling Detroit Lions pass defense in Week 16.\n\nThe Lions are 25th in the league in dropback EPA since Week 9. Their injury-depleted secondary is getting picked apart with Detroit allowing 24.3 completions per game over the last three contests.\n\nWith the Lions 7-point faves on Sunday, expect a negative game script for the Pittsburgh Steelers with plenty of passing. Rodgers has completed more than 20.5 passes in six of his last nine games and should eclipse that number again.\n\nAfter a red-hot start to the season, Jacksonville Jaguars running back Travis Etienne Jr. has cooled off. Etienne has logged fewer than 60 rushing yards in six of his last 10 games and is averaging just 3.8 yards per carry over that span.\n\nHe was held to fewer than 35 rushing yards and less than 3.0 ypa in two of his last three games. What's especially concerning about those numbers is that they came with a positive game script against terrible Titans and Jets defenses.\n\nHe'll have a much tougher time in Week 16 against a Denver stop unit that allows the second-fewest rushing yards per game (90.9) on 3.9 yards per carry. Etienne is at his best on outside zone runs, where he averages 6.9 yards per rush. However, the Broncos allow just 3.3 yards per rush on outside zone attempts.\n\nNew Orleans Saints wideout Chris Olave reeled in six catches for 85 yards last week. He has logged at least 62 receiving yards in six of his last nine games, and he's finally getting good quarterback play with Tyler Shough under center.\n\nOlave gets a mouth-watering matchup this week at home against the New York Jets, who traded away top corner Sauce Gardner at the deadline. The Jets are 31st in the league in defensive dropback EPA while ranking 28th in DVOA against No. 1 WRs.\n\nOlave has been the Saints' only reliable pass catcher after they traded Rashid Shaheed and Brandin Cooks, so expect him to get fed the ball. This is a five-star play according to EV Analytics, which is projecting 71.57 yards for Olave.\n\nBrissett o37.5 pass attempts (-120)\n\nRodgers o20.5 completions (-138)\n\nEtienne u60.5 rush yards (-114)\n\nOlave o61.5 receiving yards (-114)\n\nMy NFL weekly props column is 39-31 this season for +3.86 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTo say that things haven’t been going especially well for the Golden State Warriors would be an understatement. The Warriors have lost three straight games and six out of their last 10. They currently sit ninth in the Western Conference standings with an underwhelming record of 13-15 – not quite where they expected to be at this stage of the season.\n\nIn their most recent game, the Warriors lost to the Phoenix Suns by one point, 99-98. Luckily, they won’t have to wait too long for a shot at revenge, as the two teams are set to square off again on Saturday night.\n\nThe Warriors will be without a couple of key contributors for the contest as Seth Curry and Al Horford have both been ruled out due to injuries. But, the good news for the team is that superstar guard Steph Curry will be available, as he’s not listed on the official injury report for the game against Phoenix.\n\nCurry appears to have recovered completely from the quad injury that cost him five games earlier this month. The showdown with the Suns on Saturday will be the fourth consecutive game played in by Curry after that string of absences.\n\nUnfortunately, Curry’s return to action hasn’t correlated to winning for Golden State as the Warriors have dropped all three games since his return. But, there’s no question that him being available gives the Warriors their best chance at winning.\n\nOn the season, Curry is averaging 28.8 points, 4.1 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals per performance.",

    "fullText": "The award, presented by the Swedish FA (SvFF), is given specifically to the country’s best attacking player.\n\nIn the 2025 vote, Gyokeres finished ahead of Liverpool striker Isak and Celtic winger Benjamin Nygren, underlining his continued status as Sweden’s top centre forward.\n\nIsak was named Sweden’s overall Men’s Player of the Year after winning the Guldbollen, taking the title from Gyokeres who won it in 2024, but for the striker specific category the FF again selected Gyokeres.\n\nThe SvFF cited his goals, physical presence and decisive performances across the calendar year, with reference to his prolific spell at Sporting before his move to Arsenal.\n\nGyokeres scored 56 goals in all competitions during the year, including 39 in Liga Portugal, finishing as the division’s top scorer.\n\nIn its announcement, the SvFF said: “After a powerful spring at Sporting Lisbon, where Viktor Gyokeres poured in goals and established himself as one of Europe’s hottest strikers, a big summer transfer followed and an autumn with adaptation to Arsenal and a new level.\n\n“Almost always mechanically reliable, with a volcanic primal power that makes him both difficult to stop and impossible to ignore.”\n\nGyokeres described the award as the culmination of a demanding year split between success in Portugal and adjustment to life in the Premier League.\n\n“It has been an eventful year,” he said. “We won both the league and the cup with Sporting, and it was incredible to be part of and write history there. Then to make the move to Arsenal and be in the environment here and play is fantastic. I am incredibly proud and happy about the award. I take a lot of positives with me from 2025.”\n\nAhead of Arsenal’s trip to Everton, Mikel Arteta was asked about the scrutiny Gyokeres has faced since his arrival. The Arsenal manager said: “I think the level of attention on him hasn’t changed since he signed to today. That’s normal. Everybody was so excited to bring a No. 9 into the club.\n\n“We brought a player with an incredible scoring record that had to adapt to the league. He had no pre-season. The first few weeks were difficult because physically he wasn’t in his best state and he’s a player that needs that. Then he kicked on.\n\n“I think he had a really good period and he got injured, and now he’s back. But I saw a lot of positive things in the last two games that he’s done. We need to continue to tweak and understand him a little bit better in certain situations and he needs to do the same. But that’s about time and we have full support for him.”",

    "description": "Balanophora is a plant that abandoned photosynthesis long ago and now lives entirely as a parasite on tree roots, hidden in dark forest undergrowth. Scientists surveying rare populations across East Asian islands uncovered how its cellular machinery shrank but didn’t disappear, revealing unexpected similarities to parasites like malaria. Some island species even reproduce without sex, cloning themselves to colonize new habitats. This strange survival strategy comes with risks, leaving the plant highly vulnerable to habitat loss.",
    "fullText": "In the damp shade beneath moss-covered trees, high in the mountains of Taiwan and mainland Japan or deep within the subtropical forests of Okinawa, an unusual organism quietly grows. At first glance, it resembles a mushroom. In reality, it is a plant called Balanophora, and it possesses some of the smallest flowers and seeds known in the plant world.\n\nUnlike most plants, Balanophora contains no chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It also lacks a conventional root system to draw water from the soil. Instead, it survives entirely by attaching itself to the roots of specific nearby trees and stealing the nutrients it needs. Some species and populations take this strangeness even further by producing seeds without fertilization -- a reproductive strategy that is extremely rare among plants.\n\nScientists uncover the secrets of a long-mysterious plant\n\nThe genus Balanophora takes its name from its acorn-like appearance (Greek: balanos, acorn; phoros, bearing), and it has puzzled scientists for generations. Because the plant is rare and restricted to highly specific habitats that are increasingly threatened by human activity, most research has been limited to isolated populations.\n\nThat is now changing. A collaborative team from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Kobe University, and the University of Taipei has conducted a broad survey of Balanophora across its scattered and hard-to-reach habitats. Their findings, published in New Phytologist, trace the plant's evolutionary history, reveal how its internal structures have adapted to a parasitic lifestyle, and open new doors for future research into this unusual lineage.\n\nAs study lead author Dr. Petra Svetlikova, Science and Technology Associate at OIST, explains: \"Balanophora has lost much of what defines it as a plant, but retained enough to function as a parasite. It's a fascinating example of how something so strange can evolve from an ancestor that looked like a normal plant with leaves and a normal root system.\"\n\nShrinking plastids and life without photosynthesis\n\nParasitic plants often undergo dramatic internal changes as they become more dependent on their hosts. One common trend is the reduction or loss of plastids -- a category of plant organelles that includes chloroplasts, which enable photosynthesis in most plants.\n\nEven though Balanophora relies completely on its host trees for nutrition, the researchers found that it has not eliminated its plastids. Instead, these structures have been pared down to a minimal form. While non-parasitic plants may use up to 200 genes to build and maintain plastids, Balanophora retains only about 20. Despite this extreme reduction, more than 700 proteins are still transported into these plastids from the surrounding cell, indicating that they continue to perform essential functions.\n\nProfessor Filip Husnik, head of the Evolution, Cell Biology, and Symbiosis Unit at OIST, notes the surprise of this discovery. \"That Balanophora plastids are still involved in the biosynthesis of many compounds unrelated to photosynthesis was surprising. It implies that the order and timing of plastid reduction in non-photosynthetic plants is similar to other eukaryotes, such as the malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium, which originated from a photosynthetic ancestor.\"\n\nAn ancient lineage shaped by islands\n\nThis family began diversifying during the mid-Cretaceous period, roughly 100 million years ago -- making it one of the earliest land plant lineages to abandon photosynthesis entirely.\n\nReproduction without sex and the risks of survival\n\nBalanophora's reproductive strategies are just as unusual as its appearance and lifestyle. Reproductive methods vary widely between species and even between populations. Some require fertilization to produce seeds, while others can also reproduce without fertilization, a process known as facultative agamospermy. In the most extreme cases, some species are obligately agamospermous, meaning they never reproduce sexually at all.\n\n\"Obligate agamospermy is exceedingly rare in the plant kingdom, because it typically carries a lot of negative downsides -- lack of genetic diversity, accumulation of bad mutations, dependence on specific conditions, higher extinction risk, and so on,\" says Dr. Svetlikova. \"Fascinatingly, we found that the obligately agamospermous Balanophora species were all island species -- and we speculate that more Balanophora species may be facultative, or even obligate, agamosperms.\"\n\nOne advantage of this reproductive approach is that a single female plant can establish a new population after reaching an island. This ability allows Balanophora to spread quickly into the narrow ecological niche it prefers: dark, moist forest undergrowth where few other plants can survive.\n\nA fragile future for a highly specialized plant\n\nDespite its ability to clone itself, Balanophora is extremely selective about its hosts. Each population typically parasitizes only a small number of tree species. This specialization makes the plant especially vulnerable to environmental change.\n\nDr. Svetlikova emphasizes the importance of collaboration and conservation. \"We're very thankful to our collaborators Dr. Huei-Jiun Su and Dr. Kenji Suetsugu, experts on parasitic plants, for their help in sampling the studied Balanophora species, and to local authorities in Okinawa that allowed us to study these extraordinary plants,\" she says. \"Most known habitats of Balanophora are protected in Okinawa, but the populations face extinction by logging and unauthorized collection. We hope to learn as much as we can about this fantastic, ancient plant before it's too late. It serves as a reminder of how evolution continues to surprise us.\"\n\nMaterials provided by Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) Graduate University.

    "title": "Design is more than code",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Designing with code is a recurring discussion, and it’s flared up again. I’ve written about it twice now. Design as a search, not a pipeline. How tools carry opinions, and how those opinions shape what feels “reasonable” to attempt. Why constraints that arrive too early can close off possibilities before you’ve had a chance to find them. I’m skeptical of the industry’s drive toward grand unification, collapsing a nuanced process into code and calling it progress.\n\nThe recent discourse has focused on whether designers should code, whether code is the right medium for design, how code “presents the truth” of a design, and so on. But I think centering this debate on code and tools is reductive.\n\nThe bigger question to me is what happens to how we see designers contributing in the future, especially now with AI and these new tools. How do roles evolve, and what do we start expecting from each of them?\n\nAre designers now engineers, with the same expectations? Do engineers start having the same expectations of designers? Will we still have a “head of engineering” and “head of design”, or does it turn into something like “head of craft”? Titles don’t matter that much, but these questions are useful because they reveal what we value and how we think the job gets done.\n\nAnd then the practical question. If designers get funneled toward engineering, designing with code directly, is that a good direction? What do we lose or gain?\n\nPart of why this discussion gets messy is that design means different things to different people. Your view on it depends on what kind of design you do, and how you understand design as a practice.\n\nI believe design comes in many flavors. It’s influenced by the person, the domain, the market, the customers. In consumer products, you might need to test ideas quickly because motivations are hard to predict. In B2B or enterprise, you often have more context and can design from that. Some industries require extreme reliability and clarity. The environment matters too. Stakeholders, clients, company culture, and your skills as a designer. If you’re more visual, you lead with visuals. If you’re strong in code, you might use it earlier.\n\nAnd for some, design simply is getting the button on the screen and moving on.\n\nSo there’s a broad domain of software design, with different tools and methods inside it. The code vs no-code argument often misses the point and becomes a polarizing force.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that I want to elevate this discussion above tools, and make sure tools don’t take over the future of design. I don’t want us to needlessly devalue conceptual and divergent thinking just because new tools make execution easier.\n\nEven engineers who work with code all day step away from it. They draw architectures, plan systems, and reason about tradeoffs. While code is where software lives, it’s not always where all decisions should be made.\n\nTo explain what I mean, I have to start with how I understand design and how I’ve practiced it.\n\nFirst of all, I’m not a formally trained designer. It’s been self-taught through hundreds of design projects over the last two decades. So I’m not advocating gatekeeping, or any one “right” way to design. But I do think design is rarely linear. You work at different levels of abstraction, move between them. And while the outcome is the goal, spending time on the journey can make the outcome better.\n\nThrough that work, I learned to question the problem first, not treat it as an assumption. If asked to work on something, I start with: is this a real problem? What if we don’t do this? Who defined the problem?\n\nIt sounds philosophical, but what I’ve found is that the most common reason design projects drag or fail is that the problem wasn’t clear. People won’t agree on solutions, because they have different problems in mind. The solution becomes a compromise of many different problems, instead of a clean solution to one major problem. This compounds when you have too many stakeholders.\n\nTo tackle this, I’d do two things. Write the problem the way I understood it, and ask who the stakeholders are. Then when presenting solutions to those stakeholders, I’d repeat the problem to see if it caused reactions. If it did, I’d stop and get the room to align on the problem. So what does this have to do with design? This sounds kind of corporate.\n\nYou’re always going to have stakeholders, if not colleagues, then customers. You have to understand whether feedback is true because the solution isn’t good, or because people don’t agree on what the problem is. Sometimes you’re designing against the wrong problem. The problem is the first part of the equation. It’s the foundation of what you’re trying to design and build.\n\nAt Linear, we knew quickly that companies needed projects. So what goes on the roadmap is “build projects.” Everyone agrees it’s needed. But if you think about it more, why do companies organize work into projects? Why not just work on the next task? What happens if they don’t have projects?\n\nYou can go deep on project management. There’s a whole discipline behind it, and many ways of doing it. But if your vision is to build a purpose-built tool for software companies, you start narrowing. What do they actually care about?\n\nSimply put, projects are a natural abstraction for companies to manage streams of work. They help with accountability, ownership, cross-team collaboration, predictability, and visibility.\n\nNow you might ask why research something so basic or well understood. Sometimes you don’t need to. But learning the landscape and history gives you orientation. You find assumptions you can challenge, or you decide which traditions to follow.\n\nMost importantly, learning the problem first helps you decide what you want to do about it. What direction the product vision is pulling you toward. What you want to optimize and influence.\n\nAt Linear, we saw that projects might be the most important unit of work. Products are made of them, organizations orient around them, and you celebrate when one ships. That understanding gave us a direction for what problem we were trying to solve.\n\nI think of designing the solution in two stages: The conceptual stage and the execution stage. The conceptual stage is finding the overall form the design will take. While the execution stage is building it out and getting it onto the screen.\n\nTake projects in an issue tracking tool, you could treat them as one large issue with sub-issues, a folder or label of issues, or its own entity connected to issues. Those are conceptual ideas you can consider without putting anything on the screen. The decision comes down to your understanding of users, the company, and the vision you want. All of these concepts can work, and you can find them in real products.\n\nBecause we saw projects as important, and different to issues, they needed to be their own entity, with their own shape. A project should have a recognizable form and functionality that communicates status, reasoning, user feedback, prioritization, timing, and connection to larger initiatives. Demoting projects to a label or a loose collection of issues didn’t feel right.\n\nThis conceptual stage might happen in words, on paper, in a design tool, or in code. It’s just about giving those ideas a shape, trying different directions and eventually choosing the direction that serves the problem and the product vision the best.\n\nOnce I have a direction I believe in, it’s ready for broader feedback. You test the concept by building it.\n\nIt’s the part closest to the final output. You make the design concept actually work, shaping it into something real. Code, or working with the material, is essential for this. And there are times when you gain new insights and have to go back and revisit the problem or concept.\n\nThere are different ways to use code in this stage. You can build tools, or “sketch” with throwaway code. This removes some of the constraints of production code and makes the process more exploratory. My point is that while you might see the execution stage as the real part of design, you’ve already built a foundation of context and confidence. When the material fights back, you’re pushing with that confidence.\n\nThink of it in LLM terms. The design work you do before is the goal, context, and prompt you’re building for the agent to address the problem. The execution work is where you guide the agent through specific decisions.\n\nAfter reading all this, you might think, who has time for this? We need to ship. Why not build right away and figure it out as we go? I don’t think it comes down to time. My explanation might have been long, but the process itself can be fast. You just spend the time needed.\n\nMy feeling is that without that context and goal built in, you might be iterating toward a direction, but not one that was chosen intentionally.\n\nThis brings me back to where I started. Our industry is not very patient, and once you start building designs directly to production as the default, the culture and organizational reasons to consider problems, concepts, and intentions start evaporating. We start devaluing the why behind our designs in favor of output.\n\nMy worry isn’t the code or the tools themselves. It’s a decline in consideration, and with that, a decline in unique, well-designed products. The question is how we keep that alive even as new tools and technologies emerge.\n\nTo me, design was never about what the button is or does, or which medium you work in. It was and is about finding the right problem, the right intent, the right vision. The feature you design and build today should be a considered step toward that vision.\n\nThank you Charlie Aufmann, Tuhin Kumar, Ramon Marc, Conor Muirhead, Gavin Nelson, Raphael Schaad, Jeff Smith, and Soleio for their comments and discussion on this topic.",

    "fullText": "Those nearing retirement have plenty to think about. Having enough money to live off of in one's old age is an important factor to consider. But for those with extra capital to spend, deciding how they want to spend it (vacations, time with family, or philanthropy) is another key item to consider.\n\nWaiting until age 70 to claim Social Security increases benefits by 8% annually after age 65.\n\nSocial Security benefits are based on the highest 35 years of indexed earnings.\n\nUp to 85% of Social Security payments can be taxable for retirees with 401(k) income.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe good news for retirees in the U.S. is that everyone receives their Social Security payments (or is eligible to receive them - you have to apply) come age 65. Those who wait longer can see higher payouts, and it is also possible to claim these benefits early (something most personal finance experts caution against).\n\nBut in terms of putting together a checklist of \"to do\" items to think about before the end of the year, here's the best advice I've seen for baby boomers looking to set themselves up for their golden years.\n\nSocial security cards with $100 bills\n\nFinding out what one's expected benefits are should be the first step in trying to put together a monthly budget for retirement. After all, social security payments can make up a significant percentage of most retirees' income in retirement, particularly for those who choose to stop working after they begin taking distributions.\n\nFor investors who haven't built up a retirement portfolio at all, these payments will amount to the entirety of their monthly income. So, understanding how these benefits will be calculated is an important first step in putting together a comprehensive plan.\n\nSocial security benefits are based on the highest 35 years of indexed earnings. What this can mean is that seniors who choose to work past the age of 62 may increase their overall earnings, if their pay is higher than their lowest-earning years. Thus, many may want to think about choosing to stay in the workforce longer, not only to contribute to their retirement accounts, but also to increase their potential social security payouts as well.\n\nFor those able to do so and in good health, the other key factor to consider is potentially waiting until age 70 (versus retiring at the full retirement age) to maximize benefits. Every year a prospective retiree waits after the age of 65 adds 8% to their benefits for the rest of their life. Importantly, this starting amount one chooses to receive will be eligible of annual cost of living adjustments, so maximizing one's base can be the best way to go.",

    "fullText": "A critically endangered eagle has returned to one of its few remaining habitats after a two-year absence, according to a recent wildlife survey.\n\nThe GMA network reported that a Philippine eagle, one of the largest raptors in the world, was spotted in the skies over Mt. Sinaka in Cotabato on the island of Mindanao. The area is one of its smallest natural habitats, but it offers a safe nesting site in the mountains and enough prey for a breeding pair to rear chicks.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for Region 12 (DENR-12) said the area's designation as a critical habitat: \"[It] has opened opportunities for funding and resource allocation to support continued research, conservation programs, and sustainable management practices vital for the survival of the Philippine eagle and other endangered species in the area.\"\n\nThe Philippine eagle is the nation's national bird and is found only on the islands of Leyte, Luzon, Mindanao, and Samar. Its size and spiky crest make it instantly recognizable. They were once more widespread, but species endemic to island nations are particularly vulnerable to habitat destruction. Extensive deforestation in the Philippines has caused its many unique species to suffer sharp population declines. There are only around 400 breeding pairs left in the wild.\n\nAs a large raptor, the Philippine eagle fulfills a key role in maintaining the balance of the food web in the country's few remaining forests as an apex predator. Known by some locals as the \"monkey-eating eagle,\" the Philippine eagle has a slightly more varied diet than the legends suggest. They use both still and perch hunting techniques to conserve energy while scouting for prey, but once they commit to the hunt, they move with breathtaking speed and power.\n\nThe story underlines the importance of regularly monitoring an area's wildlife with cameras to identify and prioritize critical habitats for protection. The information gleaned from the survey will also help raise awareness of the challenges this magnificent bird faces. There's a long road ahead, but with enough knowledge and will, the Philippine eagle can soar again.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "A veteran civil rights attorney won a landmark redistricting case. He fears such wins could soon vanish.",
    "fullText": "The beleaguered Voting Rights Act is on the ropes again — and it may soon suffer a crippling strike.\n\nThe Supreme Court seems on the verge of making it much harder to use the landmark civil rights measure to force states to draw districts where minority candidates stand a strong chance of winning. And a key provision that lets private groups sue under the 60-year-old law could be the next to fall.\n\nThat would be a huge blow to civil rights lawyers like Mississippi’s Carroll Rhodes, who’s spent his career leveraging the Voting Rights Act to increase the political power of Black people and other minorities.\n\n“It becomes almost an impossible hill to climb,” Rhodes told POLITICO Magazine.\n\nOver the past decade or so, the VRA has been battered by a series of hits from the increasingly conservative high court. In 2013, the justices knocked out a key pillar of the law by eliminating “pre-clearance” requirements for advance approval of voting changes, including redistricting, in most or all of nine states and a smattering of localities.\n\nIn recent months, petitions have stacked up at the Supreme Court that could lead to the justices wiping out the long-assumed right of private groups and individuals to bring lawsuits under the law. And, earlier this month, the high court blocked a lower court’s Voting Rights Act ruling and gave Texas a green light to redraw its congressional map at President Donald Trump’s request in order to give Republicans up to five additional House seats.\n\nDespite those challenges, litigators like Rhodes have had significant success harnessing the VRA. A lawsuit he pressed forced redistricting and a special election in Mississippi last month led to Black Democrats picking up two additional seats in the state’s House. The incremental gain broke a longstanding GOP supermajority in a state that is nearly 40 percent Black — the highest percentage in the nation. Those sorts of advances for minority representation could come to a halt if the Supreme Court rules against the law.\n\nI reached Rhodes at his law office in the small town of Hazelhurst, Miss. and asked him to take stock of the bruises the VRA has sustained, the threats it faces at the moment and how he’s managed to use the law to advance minority power in his home state.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act has taken a lot of major hits from the Supreme Court in the past couple decades. Many lawyers now see it as teetering on the brink of irrelevance or impotence. What are the stakes in the pending case, Louisiana v. Callais, and whether states doing redistricting can sometimes make use of race to comply with the VRA?\n\nSome people are concerned that the Voting Rights Act might be on its way out, but I'm an eternal optimist. Given that the Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress pursuant to the 15th Amendment, and the 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote on an equal basis, not on account of race, to everyone — I think in the Callais case that they're going to resolve that issue in favor of [the law] being upheld.\n\nYou’ve had considerable success in Mississippi with the Voting Rights Act and the state legislature there. Does that confound perceptions that the VRA is at death’s door?\n\nWe have been successful. A lot of civil rights organizations and civil rights opponents have been successful in using the Voting Rights Act to increase the number of Black elected officials.\n\nIn Mississippi, for the most part, whites do not vote for Black candidates in contested elections, and that's why the Voting Rights Act has been so successful in creating Black majority districts.\n\nWhen you have a minority population that's large enough, concentrated enough, and they're in these election districts where they cannot elect candidates of their choice — because the majority population always votes against their candidates of choice — you have to redraw the districts in such a way so you give this large, geographically insular minority group the ability to elect the representative of their choice. And Mississippi's demographics have made it easier for us to be successful here.\n\nHas there been a concrete impact to this?\n\nThere was a time where we had 45 or 50 Black people elected from Black majority districts in the Mississippi Legislature. And there were Black chairmen of different committees, even the powerful committees. But what has happened over the years, more and more white Democrats have left the Democratic Party and gone toward the Republican Party, so now you have a [GOP] supermajority in the Senate. We broke that in this last election.\n\nWhen you break the supermajority in the Senate, money bills, especially taxing and spending, budget, a lot of times it takes a supermajority to get those bills passed. If there is no supermajority, then that means that the Republican leadership within the Senate will have to negotiate with most of the Black people elected as Democrats.\n\nHave those legislators been able to use this effective veto to actually get some spending concessions in terms of, “You're going to spend in this part of the state or on these types of programs?”\n\nWe won't know yet because the special election just took place, and the legislature comes back in January. So, we will see if this cohesive group of Black Democrats can get some concessions.\n\nIn 2013, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the Shelby County decision, which ended the requirement that many states, including Mississippi, most places across the South and a few in the North, had to submit any voting changes — including redistricting — to the Justice Department to get approved. The maps that Mississippi adopted in 2022, which you successfully challenged in court, were they put in place initially because of the Shelby County decision?\n\nThey were able to do it directly because of Shelby County, yes. And John Roberts got it wrong. I agree with Justice Ginsburg who said at the time, it’s like standing up under the umbrella and it's not raining and saying, “Oh, it's not raining, so you can let the umbrella down.” That's what that Roberts decision did: took the umbrella down. And rain is falling everywhere.\n\nUnder the process essentially abandoned after Shelby County, the maps had to be submitted to Washington, and that took place under presidents both Republican and Democrat. The maps that you challenged, do you think President Obama's Justice Department would have approved them? What about President George W. Bush’s Justice Department or President Donald Trump’s Justice Department?\n\nThe Trump Justice Department would have approved them, but no other president. And I'm going to go back to Obama, Biden, Clinton, I'd even go back to Ronald Reagan. The strange thing is that Ronald Reagan initially was opposed to the Voting Rights Act extension in 1982 but wound up signing it and cited it as the crown jewel of American democracy. And so the Trump Justice Department probably is the only one, because the Trump Justice Department had flipped what the purpose of the Voting Rights Act was — to protect minority voters — to say it's to protect white voters.\n\nRoberts has been on the court now for 22 years. The first decade and a half or so, he was viewed uniformly as hostile to voting rights enforcement. That was seen as one of his animating issues. But there have been a few decisions in recent years where the court has not been as aggressive toward the Voting Rights Act as some expected. It seems like Roberts went along with this current Callais case being punted for a year, which basically left those districts in place through the current election cycle. Is there something going on with Roberts? Do you think he has shifted or moderated at all?\n\nMy personal take is that he really is really an incrementalist. He's not for upending longstanding precedent and what the country has become accustomed to. He believes in incremental changes and I think the Shelby County decision came about because he genuinely thought that so much advancement had been made in this area that it was no longer necessary for those protections. And I think after Shelby County, he's seen that those protections are still needed. His views might be moderating somewhat. He might see the damage that Shelby County decision has caused.\n\nYou've had this span of four or five decades to look at how these things have developed. How has technology changed this process of redistricting? Has it made it easier for those trying to dilute the power of minority voters to do that, and have people on your side of the fight been able to harness that technology in any similar fashion to fight back against those efforts?\n\nWhen I first started out in this area, the map drawers used maps and pencils and even had notepads to add before the calculators came. Then calculators and then the programs and social science has developed over the years, too. Statistical analysis has become more and more sophisticated, and the technology has become more and more sophisticated.\n\nMy take is that whoever writes the algorithm, whoever writes the code, the code can be written in such a way that it could lead to more discrimination and make it harder to undo.\n\nWe do have folks on our side who are using technology, but technology was used in the Texas case to draw districts in such a way that discriminated against Black and Latino voters in Texas.\n\nYou were a teenager when a lot of these landmark civil rights laws were passed in the ‘60s. Do you personally have memories of what the Jim Crow South was like? Did any of your relatives experience some of these more bizarre tests that were used for decades before that to exclude Black people from voting, like, ‘How many bubbles are in a bar of soap?’ or ‘How many jelly beans are in the jar?’\n\nOh, yes. I was born in ‘51. I grew up in a segregated neighborhood, went to an all-Black high school, segregated high school, segregated elementary school. I remember going to the dentist. And the dentist office had two entrances, one for white, one for “colored,” and going through the white side, they had air conditioning. They had magazines. The “colored” side did not.\n\nWe had field trips to the courthouse, where the courthouse had white and “colored” water fountains. And we had to sit in the balcony. I remember a third grade field trip to the courthouse and we watched a trial where a white lawyer was defending a Black man accused of some crime. And he was saying, “This was a good Nigra” — N-I-G-R-A.\n\nAnd so I grew up through it and I also remember my parents when the Voting Rights Act was first passed, and they did have federal registrars around, but all of the neighbors, my parents and everybody not only did they go and register to vote, they voted in every election, no matter what.\n\nThere were people telling us stories. Tim Winston owned a funeral home here and he was one of the few Black people who was able to register prior to the Voting Rights Act being passed, and he told stories of how they were turning away Black folks by asking them ridiculous questions. So, yeah, I remember, personally, stories of how hard it was before the Voting Rights Act was passed and after it was passed.\n\nIf the Voting Rights Act Section Two were to be knocked out and it wasn't a tool you could use anymore, what would be the strategy after that? Would that mean there's no option for civil rights groups? What is the world going to look like if the VRA is not available for private groups to litigate?\n\nIt almost becomes an impossible hill to climb. You have to go back to the 15th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult, or the 14th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult. All a legislative body has to do is say, “We didn't draw the district based on race. We drew them based on partisanship, and they're entitled to the presumption that there was a good faith effort to do that, and it's hard.” We had overwhelming evidence in Texas that partisanship was not the real reason. If that cannot overcome a presumption that the legislator was acting in good faith, going forward, it's going to be impossible to prove a racial gerrymandering claim.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the federal Constitution puts no limits on partisan gerrymandering, even as the justices continue to aggressively police use of race in redistricting. Is that line meaningful?\n\nRace and party, in Mississippi, there’s no distinction. It’s a fiction.",

    "fullText": "New Zealand native BENEE has been at the forefront of indie-pop since her song \"Supalonely\" went viral in 2019. Her knack for combining colloquial language with eccentric melodies is on full display throughout her sophomore album, \"Ur an Angel I'm Just Particles.\"\n\nBENEE recently told me the title was inspired by the album's abstract narrative sequence: obsession, breakdown, ascension.\n\nShe also said that she spent three years tinkering with the tracklist (as opposed to the quick turnaround between her 2019 pair of EPs and 2020 debut), and worked closely with a creative director for the first time, which helped her clarify dominant moods and themes (existential dread, emerging adulthood, childlike wonder) to keep the album focused.\n\n\"It made me think of it more as a whole story as opposed to a cluster of songs,\" BENEE said. \"Listening to albums that I love, it feels so cohesive. I always found that kind of scary, because I'm all over the place as an artist, and eclectic. But I'm proud to say that this one is a lot more put together… I've grown a lot.\"\n\nBest songs: \"Demons,\" \"Cinnamon,\" \"Vegas\"\n\nAs the title suggests, \"13 Months of Sunshine\" is a summer soundtrack that overdelivers.\n\nPortland's Aminé is particularly adept at surfing tropical beats and riding house grooves, as evidenced by \"Kaytraminé,\" his 2023 collaborative album with Kaytranada. He's also a capably introspective rapper, as evidenced by his last solo release, 2020's \"Limbo.\"\n\n\"13 Months of Sunshine\" makes space for both gifts, as well as a new one: the album features several novel detours into alt-pop, facilitated by new collaborators like Jim-E Stack, Waxahatchee, and Toro y Moi.\n\nBest songs: \"Cool About It (feat. Lido),\" \"Raspberry Kisses,\" \"13MOS\"\n\nBillie Marten's fifth album, \"Dog Eared,\" is a marvel of good old-fashioned musicianship. It was recorded live at Sugar Mountain studio in New York, with Marten and her team of musicians \"huddled up in a circle,\" producer Phil Weinrobe said in a press release. \"No headphones, no walls, no playback, nothing separating each person from the next, and nothing separating the performers from their performances.\"\n\nNimble and concise at just 37 minutes, the album is marked by organic instrumentation, Marten's seasoned vocals, and the unmistakable milieu of intimacy. While best enjoyed as a complete set, any of the album's 10 tracks would stand tall alongside Laurel Canyon legends like Neil Young or Carole King, as well as celebrated contemporaries like Clairo, Faye Webster, or Adrianne Lenker.\n\nBest songs: \"Feeling,\" \"Crown,\" \"Planets\"\n\nFour years after their acclaimed 2021 album, \"Blue Weekend,\" Wolf Alice returned with a vengeance and a little razzle-dazzle. \"The Clearing\" is a massive swing for the British band, one that more often evokes '70s hits by ABBA and Queen than the grungier indie rock of their early work.\n\nIt suits them. As their crowds have swelled to fill arenas, their arrangements have ballooned to match. Lead vocalist Ellie Rowsell sounds more ecstatic and confident than ever, even while she's wondering if her appetite for melodrama makes her a narcissist or a masochist. \"God knows that I can't resist,\" she belts out in the opening track, \"to make a song and dance about it.\"\n\nBest songs: \"Thorns,\" \"Passenger Seat,\" \"White Horses\"\n\nPlayboi Carti's \"Music\" is the year's most audacious hip-hop album. The Atlanta rapper is joined on his 30-track odyssey by many of the genre's biggest hitmakers, including Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, Future, Young Thug, and Lil Uzi Vert, some of whom return for more than one joint. The Weeknd also lends his famous croon to the album's fan-favorite hit, \"Never Lie.\"\n\nCarti stakes his rightful place in that star-studded lineup, guiding the listener through creative detours, tonal shifts, and contradictions, but never a dull moment.\n\nBest songs: \"Rather Lie (with The Weeknd),\" \"Backd00r (feat. Kendrick Lamar and Jhené Aiko),\" \"Like Weezy\"\n\nJennie, one-fourth of the K-pop sensation BLACKPINK, easily commands the spotlight on her solo debut, \"Ruby.\" Though she's routinely joined by high-profile collaborators, including Dua Lipa, Doechii, and Childish Gambino, there's never any doubt about who's the star of the show — a sentiment captured by the album's second and best track, \"Like Jennie.\" Very few artists could pull off a bilingual pop banger with a hook built around their own name, but Jennie does it with ease.\n\nBest songs: \"Like Jennie,\" \"Love Hangover (feat. Dominic Fike),\" \"Seoul City\"\n\n\"Saya,\" the official debut from Japanese-Canadian musician Saya Gray, navigates the intersection between the natural world and the inherently artificial realm of pop music. Acoustic plucks, harps, and pedal steel guitars sit comfortably alongside synth bloops and autotuned vocals. Gray told Paper magazine that she was partially inspired by a road trip across California, taking in the state's motley topography: mountains, deserts, forests.\n\nAlthough genre-bending is all the rage these days, Gray has created something that doesn't resemble anything else. She wrote all of the album's 10 songs alone, self-produced three, and co-produced the rest with her brother, Lucian Gray. \"Saya\" traverses an array of moods, textures, landscapes, and seasons in just 10 tracks, conjuring an in-between world that's both warm and wintry, green and wise, vintage and futuristic.\n\nBest songs: \"..Thus Is Why (I Don't Spring 4 Love),\" \"Shell (Of a Man),\" \"How Long Can You Keep Up a Lie?\"\n\nLucy Dacus' songwriting always grapples with matters of the heart, but \"Forever Is a Feeling\" is her most romantic work to date.\n\nIn the album's closer, when Dacus sings, \"I notice everything about you, I can't help it,\" she's not overselling it. Her lyrics are devoted and thorough, taking note of the gap in her lover's teeth, the unpaid parking ticket on her dresser, and the bug bites on her thighs.\n\nBut it's not just her lover that Dacus observes with tender precision. In \"Modigliani,\" a song about her boygenius bandmate, Phoebe Bridgers, Dacus says she realized her friend was dating a new guy because she'd picked up his mannerisms, \"like rolling your eyes and laughing real dry.\" In \"Limerence,\" a song about a doomed past relationship, Dacus can't even put her arm around an acquaintance's waist without psychoanalyzing her behavior: \"Toeing the line of betraying your trust / Why do I feel alive when I'm behaving my worst?\"\n\nIn that song's outro, Dacus sings that \"stillness might eat me alive,\" but ironically, it's in stillness where she thrives as a songwriter. Dacus has a knack for finding divinity in the details, turning the smallest gestures into revelations and the quietest glances into grand serenades.\n\nBest songs: \"For Keeps,\" \"Best Guess,\" \"Lost Time\"\n\nWet Leg's self-titled debut album was released in 2022 to critical acclaim and endorsements from iconic rockers such as Elton John, Dave Grohl, and Pearl Jam. The success sent the band from England's Isle of Wight on an extended, cross-continental tour for much of 2023.\n\nWet Leg's sophomore album, \"Moisturizer,\" reveals that years of crafting live arrangements, connecting with audiences, and fostering synergy among bandmates have done wonders for their sound. The album's lyricism preserves the irreverent, raunchy humor favored by its founders, Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers, but the production is fuller and more lived-in than that of its predecessor.\n\nChambers said in a press release that the upgrade was partially thanks to music becoming a full-time job, as opposed to a passion the bandmates previously squeezed in between other responsibilities.\n\n\"We focused more on: Is this going to be fun to play live?\" Teasdale added. \"We enjoyed blocking the outside world out and being a bit self-indulgent.\"\n\nBest songs: \"Davina McCall,\" \"Mangetout,\" \"Pokemon\"\n\nDev Hynes is frequently described by reviewers as a \"multi-hyphenate,\" \"musical polymath,\" or some other version of a Renaissance man, because his talent defies simple narratives. His name is often listed in album credits as vocalist, writer, producer, mixer, engineer, and instrumentalist (piano, drums, cello, bass, you name it). His work tends to be expertly crafted, inventive, and multilayered, both architecturally and emotionally.\n\nThe latter is especially true of \"Essex Honey,\" Hynes' fifth album as Blood Orange. The sudden loss of his mother in 2023 caused Hynes to reflect on his childhood in Essex, England, and to infuse his songs with the warmth and serenity he craved. The result is the most autobiographical and affecting album of Hynes' career.\n\n\"Grief is extremely complex and within it, there's a million shades of emotions. It's not just depression,\" Hynes told GQ. \"There's some joy when thinking about someone's life and your time with them, but then moments where you dip. Your emotions will fluctuate like crazy. And that's kind of what the album was.\"\n\nBest songs: \"Somewhere In Between,\" \"The Field (feat. The Durutti Column, Tariq Al-Sabir, Caroline Polachek, and Daniel Caesar),\" \"Mind Loaded (feat. Caroline Polachek, Lorde, and Mustafa)\"\n\nPinkPantheress opens \"Fancy That\" with a spoken-word intro that's surely been memorized by anyone who considers themselves \"very online.\" (\"My name is Pink, and I'm really glad to meet you / You're recommended to me by some people / Hey, ooh, is this illegal? / Hey, ooh, it feels illegal.\")\n\nThese days, spawning a viral TikTok trend could either be a boon for promo or a cringey kiss of death. But therein lies the charm and brilliance of PinkPantheress: Her alt-pop stylings are immune to cringe because they transport you to a time when the internet wasn't so cynical, when sharing selfies on MySpace was the peak of cool, and picking the perfect ringtone for your flip phone was a labor of love. (At one point, mine was \"Starz In Their Eyes\" by Just Jack, which PinkPantheress samples on track four, \"Stars.\" She was 5 years old when that song was released, so let no one say she doesn't do her research.)\n\nBest songs: \"Illegal,\" \"Tonight,\" \"Stateside\"\n\nJade, formerly of UK girl group Little Mix, announced her new chapter as a solo artist last year with \"Angel Of My Dreams,\" a thrillingly unconventional single that combines a contorted sample of Sandie Shaw's \"Puppet On A String\" with operatic vocals and a throbbing, clubby beat.\n\nThe song reintroduced Jade as both a student of pop's history and a glimpse of pop's future, an identity fully realized on her much-anticipated debut album. \"That's Showbiz Baby!\" frequently evokes precedent divas like Kylie Minogue (\"Fantasy\"), Donna Summer (\"Unconditional\"), and The Supremes (\"Before You Break My Heart\") without losing touch with Jade's distinctive flair.\n\nBest songs: \"Angel Of My Dreams,\" \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Unconditional\"\n\n\"Choke Enough\" is the kind of album you queue at the function to show off your stylish, superior music taste. I guarantee you'll spark at least one curious comment or surreptitious Shazam attempt — unless, of course, you live in certain pockets of Brooklyn where too many people DJ as a side gig. They already know who Oklou is.\n\nShortly after the release of Oklou's full-length debut, \"Choke Enough,\" which features a song with noted Charli XCX collaborator Bladee, the French artist was announced as an opener for Lorde's \"Virgin\" tour. Later, she teamed up with FKA twigs for \"Viscus,\" a single from the album's deluxe edition.\n\nThese cosigns signal Oklou's arrival in the preeminent electro-pop scene, whose denizens excel at transmuting the plinky, synthetic sounds of our digital world into music that sparkles and swoons.\n\nBest songs: \"Take Me By the Hand,\" \"Harvest Sky,\" \"Blade Bird\"\n\nHardly anyone thought Addison Rae could successfully rebrand from TikTok dancer to respected artist, much less within a single album cycle. But that only makes her success all the more delicious.\n\n\"Addison\" is a near-bulletproof collection of 12 pop songs, all cowritten by Rae with her producers, Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser. (Tove Burman is also credited as a cowriter on \"Lost & Found\" and \"High Fashion.\") Their tight-knit, all-female team made the bold choice to avoid obvious radio bids or club bangers. Instead, the album is mid-tempo, melodic, and unusually hypnotic.\n\n\"Addison\" peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200, and lead single \"Diet Pepsi\" scored its highest Billboard Hot 100 position at No. 54 — a modest showing, perhaps lower than expected, but one that's ultimately good for the album's legacy: \"Addison\" already glows with the charisma of a cult classic.\n\nRae has moved on from the woes and demands of superficial virality. Now's the time for her to enjoy, as she put it on the \"Popcast\" podcast, the luxury of good taste.\n\nBest songs: \"New York,\" \"Diet Pepsi,\" \"Summer Forever,\" \"Fame Is a Gun,\" \"Headphones On\"\n\nHayley Williams' third solo album, \"Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party,\" is also her first as an independent artist. After Paramore's contract with Atlantic Records was fulfilled by their 2023 album \"This Is Why,\" Williams launched her own label venture, not-so-subtly dubbed Post Atlantic.\n\nWilliams wasted no time putting her own personal spin on the album-creation process. She released the 17 original songs from \"Ego Death\" for free on her website, presented as a jumble of MP3 files in no specific order. Fans were inspired to create their own tracklists, and Williams took their input into account as she finalized the album's structure.\n\n\"Ego Death\" deliberately exists outside the major-label machinery, beyond the industry's expectations of profit and etiquette. In the fan-selected album opener, \"Ice In My OJ,\" Williams sarcastically calls herself a \"cold, hard bitch\" for daring to forge her own path, even after decades of making bigwigs rich. (Paramore signed a \"360\" deal with Atlantic when Williams was still a teenager, meaning the label took a hefty percentage of all the band's revenue streams, from publishing and touring to merchandise and brand deals. That gives the lyric \"I'm in the business of misery\" an entirely new meaning, doesn't it?)\n\nWilliams' anger is especially effective because she has the skill and experience to expose its roots. Her songwriting is sharp as ever on \"Ego Death,\" digging into themes of exploitation, performativity, false prophets, and faux morality. Stories that could come across as preachy or pretentious in lesser hands are grounded by lifelike imagery and personal disclosure. This is an album with real teeth, but it only bites when provoked.\n\nBest songs: \"Glum,\" \"Hard,\" \"True Believer,\" \"Dream Girl In Shibuya,\" \"Parachute\"\n\nDijon Duenas had a busy year. The mononymous artist was a key collaborator on two of the year's most highly reviewed albums, Bon Iver's \"Sable, Fable\" and Justin Bieber's \"Swag,\" cowriting and co-producing four songs for the latter. Dijon also made his acting debut alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Paul Thomas Anderson's \"One Battle After Another,\" which earned nine nominations for the 2026 Golden Globes, more than any other film.\n\nDijon's fingerprints are strewn, somewhat haphazardly, across this year's creative landscape. He doesn't have a calling card or a signature style. Rather, he's a shapeshifter who follows his fleeting instincts, whether it's a stroke of inspiration or, in his words, a \"fit of frustration.\"\n\n\"I woke up one day and was like, 'I should probably do an album now,'\" Dijon told Pitchfork. Over the next six weeks, his sophomore album, \"Baby,\" was cobbled together from unfinished demos, old vocal takes, and lyrics he'd previously scrapped — not what many music industry pros would consider an auspicious starting point. In a final act of contrarianism, he ran the entire track list through a $10 DJ program.\n\n\"Baby\" is a surreal data dump of an album, full of pivots, anecdotes, and interruptions. Dijon said he made a point to honor all ideas with the same gravity, whether stale or fresh, fragmented or finished. Somehow, the effect is more riveting than jarring, like when your mind jumps between unrelated scenes in a dream. The connective fibers exist, even if your subconscious doesn't immediately grasp them.\n\nBest songs: \"Baby!,\" \"Higher!,\" \"Yamaha,\" \"Rewind,\" \"Automatic\"\n\nLily Allen's \"West End Girl\" is a breakup album for the ages. The 45-minute tracklist unspools like a novel that's part memoir, part narrative fiction, and part psychological horror. Its lyrics are punctuated by details that hit like jump scares: an incriminating text from a woman named Madeline, glimpsed by mistake on her husband's phone; a Duane Reade bag full of secret sex toys, discovered in his seedy West Village apartment. Allen assumes the role of a woman lured by domestic fantasies and false promises, only to find her marriage is more like an emotional trap.\n\nAllen has confirmed that she recently split from her real-life husband, David Harbour, but as with so many memorable first-person stories, \"West End Girl\" is helmed by an unreliable narrator. The listener is trapped in her internal spiral, with little sense of what constitutes betrayal and what constitutes projection: \"Wanna believe you, but is it a ruse?\" \"Say that it's over, do you mean a hiatus?\" \"Why are we here talking about vasectomies? Did you get someone pregnant?\" \"Why won't you beg for me?\"\n\nThis kind of album — devastating, delirious, hyper-specific — should have zero replay value. And yet, against all odds, Allen makes it fun to live inside her alter-ego's frantic mind. I can't count the number of times I've reached the final line, \"You're stuck inside your fruityloop,\" and instinctively restarted the album from the top. How fitting.\n\nBest songs: \"Ruminating,\" \"Tennis,\" \"Madeline,\" \"Pussy Palace,\" \"Fruityloop\"\n\n\"Mayhem\" is not the faithful successor to \"The Fame Monster\" that Lady Gaga's fans expected. It's better.\n\nGaga's sixth solo album marries both of her musical specialties: the dark, industrial pop hooks from her chart-topping days and the bright, nostalgic melodies that suit her Oscar-winning vocal range. \"Mayhem\" is the handiwork of a woman who plowed through darkness and emerged with every reflex sharpened.\n\n\"I was willingly and openly running through all the nightmares of my past and my present and just finding poetry in all of it,\" Gaga told Rolling Stone of the album. \"And that was a sign of my health as a musician. One of the things I'm most grateful for is gaining all my artistic faculties back to make this record.\"\n\nBest songs: \"Abracadabra,\" \"Garden of Eden,\" \"Perfect Celebrity,\" \"Killah (feat. Gesaffelstein),\" \"How Bad Do U Want Me\"\n\nBack in 2019, Rosalía told The New York Times Magazine, \"I don't force things. I can have a wish, and then I let God lead me on the path, bringing me what I need — and always trying to be alert to receive it.\"\n\nThat methodology has worked wonders for Rosalía, who's forged an unlikely career as a pop star from her background as a classically trained flamenco singer, known in Spanish as a cantaora.\n\nHer 2022 album, \"Motomami,\" cemented Rosalía as a visionary hitmaker, but \"Lux\" feels like the heaven-sent album she prophesied years ago — passionate, grandiose, and improbably listenable, blending technical skill with commercial taste in a way that few artists would dare attempt, let alone achieve.\n\nRosalía, like a lightning rod for divine gifts and insights, sings in 13 different languages throughout the tracklist. She also worked closely with the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Daníel Bjarnason, to bind the songs with a common sensory thread. You don't need to understand Rosalía's lyrics to get lost in her symphony. In fact, in a time when we can find any information and achieve instant gratification at the click of a button, it's a relief to surrender to 50 minutes of mystique and awe instead.\n\nBest songs: \"Reliquia,\" \"Mio Cristo Piange Diamanti,\" \"Berghain,\" \"La Perla,\" \"Dios Es Un Stalker\"",

    "title": "I'm 61 with 16 grandkids. Instead of downsizing, we bought a bigger vacation home to finally make family trips work.",
    "description": "Doug Beachy, 61, upsized to a larger vacation home so his entire family could gather in one place, visit more frequently, and have more fun together.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 61-year-old Doug Beachy, a Cincinnati-based business owner who bought a vacation home with Pacaso in 2022. Pacaso is a platform for fractional ownership of luxury vacation homes. The company allows multiple individuals to co-own a second home and share ownership of the property. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been married to my wife, Jamie, for 37 years. We have four married children and 16 grandchildren. Our oldest grandchild is 12, and our youngest isn't quite one yet.\n\nOnce our kids started having children, they all moved back closer to home in Cincinnati, where we live. We own a five-bedroom home that's about 4,000 square feet. We're empty nesters, so there's plenty of space for us, but when the whole family is over, everyone is on top of each other.\n\nWe've converted one room into a kids' playroom and another into a nursery, and we have a finished basement where the kids can play, but family gatherings are still a bit hectic.\n\nIn the past, to bring everyone together, we would either rent a large beach house or book a cabin-style retreat in the woods here in Ohio.\n\nWe did that about every other year because it's hard to coordinate everyone's schedules — especially with grandkids in school — and seasonal rates for a large home are expensive. It was a big chunk of money for just a week's experience.\n\nHilton Head Island has always been a fun family destination for us. It's an island in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, just outside Savannah, Georgia, with about 12 miles of pristine beaches.\n\nThere's so much to do here from a family activity standpoint, in addition to simply soaking up the sun and going to the beach — it's just a great place to relax and unwind.\n\nHomes here can be expensive, though. The average home is priced in the upper $700,000s, and properties can sell for as much as $10 million. For a while, I thought about buying a second, larger home here, but I'm not retired yet, and I realized that putting that much money into a house where I don't live full time just didn't make sense.\n\nIn early 2022, I started exploring different homeownership options, including shared or fractional ownership. That's when I found Pacaso online and saw they had some homes available in Hilton Head.\n\nWe ultimately settled on an about 5,000-square-foot home with six spacious suite-like bedrooms — five with king-sized beds, large walk-in closets, and private bathrooms, and one with several bunk beds for the children — and seven and a half bathrooms.\n\nAs you can imagine, taking 20 people out to eat all the time is not exactly fun, so we wanted a house with a large, well-stocked kitchen. Our kitchen almost occupies the entire second floor and, by my last count, it can seat 19 or 20 people. It also has a beautiful ocean view.\n\nWhen we bought the home, it was valued at over $5 million. We own a 1/8 share — we made a 50% down payment on our portion of the home — and there are seven other owners, whom we don't know.\n\nOur friends will say, \"It sounds like a timeshare.\" But I think it's much more transparent than a traditional timeshare. There are no extra markups or mystery fees added on top.\n\nI also feel that, unlike a timeshare, which can leave you feeling stuck and lose value over time, this is a long-term investment. Of course, everything depends on the real-estate market, but I feel fairly confident this is an appreciating asset.\n\nI think going this route, instead of buying another second or vacation home, has eliminated all the concerns I had about upsizing — like having to maintain the home ourselves or deal with high HOA fees. We wanted a place we could share with family, and this setup works well for us at this stage of our lives.\n\nPacaso provides a house manager who handles everything. It's essentially a concierge service — the home is clean when we arrive and fully stocked with towels, linens, soaps, and disposable items, such as paper towels and paper plates.\n\nWhen we go, the only thing we really need to think about is what food we want to buy, depending on what we plan to cook — and we have a lot of good cooks in the family.\n\nWe have the home reserved for 44 nights a year, and we use nearly all of that time. Not everyone in the family is there for every stay, but they come as they please.\n\nOur family gets together more often now, about twice a year. In the summer, during the high season when the kids are out of school, we typically reserve the house for a couple of weeks at a time.\n\nThe grandkids look forward to each trip and talk about it all the time. Many of them are around the same age, and they love the opportunity to spend time with their cousins.\n\nThe house came with six beach cruiser bikes, which is perfect because there are plenty of biking trails on the island. It also has a private pool and hot tub, and the grandkids love that it's fully stocked with games and puzzles.\n\nOur favorite things to do with them are spending time in the pool, watching the sunrise, and hanging out on the beach. We also take a lot of bike rides and play pickleball. We just love how much more quality time we're spending together as a family.",

    "title": "Under threat, Ukraine’s drone schools are going to great lengths to stay off Russia's radar",
    "description": "The Ukrainian drone schools training operators for the fight with Russia take safety steps like giving staff polygraph tests and hiding.",
    "fullText": "The leaders of several drone schools training Ukraine's operators for the fight against Russia say they're targets and they have to act accordingly — tightly protecting information and even moving around.\n\nThroughout its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has launched huge drone and missile barrages at factories, training sites, and civilian infrastructure across the country, often far from the fighting in the east, straining Ukrainian defenses and serving as a constant reminder that nowhere in the country is completely safe.\n\nDrones are prolific on the battlefield in Ukraine. Operators are priority targets. It stands to reason the schools training them for war would be too. Officials from three drone schools told Business Insider that they take steps to avoid getting hit.\n\nTetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said that it must follow strict safety rules because \"the entirety of Ukraine is not safe, missile-wise, drone-wise.\"\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, told BI the safety measures, including not disclosing publicly exactly where its training centers are located and also changing their location \"from time to time,\" are necessary to prevent Russia from interfering with its training\n\nTo keep certain location data from getting out, the school doesn't allow photos and videos that might reveal where its facilities are based.\n\nThe school has been mentioned by Russia's military bloggers, influential pro-war accounts that often circulate operational details and commentary to large audiences. Though they are typically in favor of the war, they are also sometimes critical of Russia's performance and dispute some of its defense ministry's claims.\n\nRybar, a media outlet with 1.5 million Telegram subscribers, listed Dronarium as an example of Ukraine's drone training efforts. The UK has sanctioned Rybar, initially presented as a milblogger but actually a partially Russian government-sponsored information warfare operation, and the US has offered up to $10 million for information.\n\nTetyana said Russian outlets have been writing about the school since 2022, the year Russia started its full-scale invasion. \"As long as they write and talk about us, it means that they are afraid of us,\" she said. But it also means that they're on Russia's radar.\n\nShe said the school and its attendees strictly adhere to a set of critical cybersecurity rules, and said there are also general safety rules in place. \"When the air raid siren is on, all training activities, all the work, everything gets suspended, and we deconcentrate and get into safe shelters.\" She said no one is complacent.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that safety steps are crucial because \"the Russians are constantly hunting for places where military personnel gather.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have confirmed that Russia has hit some Ukrainian military training sites, killing personnel. It's the kind of thing air defenses can try to prevent, but Ukraine has suffered shortages throughout the war. Ukraine has also successfully hit Russian bases and gatherings of Russian personnel.\n\nThe key is to prevent Russia from gaining sufficient knowledge of the school to target it. Its steps include \"everyone who works at KK&A, including the cleaners,\" having to do a polygraph security interview.\n\nHe said they don't share any information about the location of the training center or about the appearance of the instructors or cadets.\n\n\"Some of our employees may have relatives or acquaintances in occupied territories who could be tortured by Russians for indirect contact with someone who opposes Russia,\" Pervak said. \"This secrecy also protects the instructors and cadets themselves, as well as their relatives, from attacks by Russian agents.\"\n\nHe said that while the added security \"hinders publicity to some extent — good things should be spoken about loudly — war dictates its own conditions. We are well aware that failing to observe the principles of secrecy may result in the death of staff or cadets.\"\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that \"Russia is interested in destroying us.\"\n\n\"Thanks to God and air defence, we're still operating.\"",

    "description": "When I needed to get back on my feet, I moved into a camper van in my grandfather's yard. We both helped each other grow.",
    "fullText": "When I got long COVID, I moved back in with my parents. I slowly settled into life back at home for the first time in eight years and had a routine of dinner and TV with my parents in the evenings, along with the occasional weekend coffee with a friend.\n\nTime crept by, and I couldn't imagine what the next steps of my life would be. I wasn't sure if I would recover, return to work, or live alone again.\n\nAfter a year, I was getting more restless as my symptoms improved, and I wanted to move on to the next step. However, I was still struggling every day, and my confidence had taken a knock. I didn't know what to do.\n\nSomeone else who was losing their independence was my grandfather. He was no longer able to drive, and so he was stuck at home in a rural area with only himself for company. My granny had died the year before, shortly followed by his dog, and so he was lonely and dependent on us for help.\n\nThat's when I came up with the idea of moving into a camper van just outside his place.\n\nWhen I suggested living in the camper in Grandad's garden, people thought I was being ridiculous. To some extent, I was. I was fortunate enough to have parents with whom I could live at home in a warm, comfortable house.\n\nBut instead, I chose to move into a tiny house at the start of Autumn because what I really needed at that point was independence. I needed to know if I could live separately from my parents, who had been there to support me when I had a day of bad symptoms. I also needed to know whether I would get too lonely on my own, without being able to sit with them in the evenings, but not always being able to go out and socialize with friends if I wasn't feeling well.\n\nSo, when my Grandad needed company and support, and we weren't sure what to do, it seemed like the perfect opportunity.\n\nI decorated the caravan a bit to make it feel like home, packed up some of my belongings, and moved in.\n\nIt didn't come without complications; an inability to get the gas to work meant I was using heated blankets and electric heaters (a sure-fire risk), but I was largely happy. Life felt like mine again.\n\nIt felt great to see my Grandad regularly. I could tell he was no longer lonely with me around. Every morning, he would come out and knock on the caravan door to say hi and check I was OK. He told my dad that he felt like we were becoming close friends.\n\nMeanwhile, I found the courage to date again. I had barely dated for the two years prior, due to a mixture of anxiety, illness, and just not wanting to put the energy into it. But I felt a whole new lease of life without my parents across the hall. I got back on dating apps and was quickly chatting with people, thanks to my newfound confidence.\n\nThe problem I had not anticipated was the lack of privacy a camper in a front garden gives you. Just before I moved in, my family had set up a Ring camera which directly faced the van. All my family were logged in (for Grandad's safety).\n\nSomehow, I forgot that as I was bringing a date past the camera, it would notify the whole family. I knew they would not be able to resist taking the piss and trying to embarrass me. After a brief panic, I managed to deactivate the camera, but bringing dates around to my new home was never easy.\n\nWhile there was a level of independence, it wasn't a typical experience. But those three months in that camper brought me closer to Grandad and helped me find my footing again.",

    "description": "I felt ashamed for being overweight in high school, so I stayed consistent with a healthy diet in college. That practice made me a better student.",
    "fullText": "The menus hadn't even closed before I blurted out my order: a salad. It was my way of throwing my friends off the scent, as if a plate of lettuce could erase the truth and hide my late-night snack binging. But deep down, I knew the only person I was fooling was myself.\n\nAt 16, about 4 years ago, standing at 5'9\" and 120 pounds overweight, I felt powerless — not just over my body, but over the insecurities that dictated how I moved through the world.\n\nWeighing over 300 pounds was the elephant in every room I walked into, and most days I felt like the elephant myself. I vividly remember sitting in doctors' offices and being told my BMI was too high, but every time their words felt clinical and detached. What I felt each day was far more immediate, as every choice I made revolved around trying to shrink: grabbing something small at restaurants, ducking out of photos, hesitating to speak up in class for fear of drawing attention.\n\nI was exhausted, yet trying to change felt even more overwhelming. I hoped everything would be different in college.\n\nWhen I arrived at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, the thought of starting fresh collided with the reality that I was still carrying the same weight, physically and emotionally.\n\nWatching everyone else carve out their independence made me realize that if I wanted to take advantage of this new beginning, I couldn't keep living in the shadow of my body insecurities. That recognition, that no one could make this change for me, was the first real decision I ever made on my own.\n\nThe process was messy. I researched and experimented, failed and adjusted, over and over again. I cut out seconds, swapped soda for water, and reminded myself that a slice of cake today would not help me tomorrow.\n\nAt first, it felt impossible. I failed often, sometimes in secret, but each time that I pulled myself back on track, I chipped away at the belief that I was incapable of discipline.\n\nAt first, the changes felt so small they seemed pointless, but gradually I noticed patterns forming. My cravings dulled, my routines steadied, and I began to trust myself in situations that once felt impossible.\n\nI came to understand that progress was not a straight line; it curved, dipped, and sometimes reversed. The true test was whether I could keep going even when no one else was forcing me to.\n\nSuccess didn't come as dramatic numbers on a scale but in quieter victories: having the energy to walk across campus without losing my breath, joining a conversation instead of hanging back, and looking in the mirror without immediately turning away.\n\nThe discipline and resilience I built through that journey have carried into every corner of my college life. Balancing coursework, adjusting to independence, and navigating friendships all required the same patience and persistence I first practiced at the table.\n\nI approached long nights of studying the way I approached exercise: one choice at a time, knowing consistency mattered more than perfection. I learned to prioritize my well-being, to recognize when to push forward and when to rest, and to trust that even when progress didn't look linear, it was still happening.\n\nWith the past in the rearview mirror, the desire for change and knowledge feeds my hunger that was once covered up by sweets and treats. My curiosity for more only grew.\n\nThe skills I have obtained before and during my transformation have taught me to believe that change is good. It pushes you to grow into the person you are meant to be. The hardships, growth, and setbacks have helped build my mindset to continue pushing myself.",

    "fullText": "Former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle’s wife Cristina texted her mother shortly before the plane they were on crashed in North Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe Biffles were among seven people on the Cessna Citation that crashed as it was attempting to land shortly after takeoff from Statesville Regional Airport. All seven on board were killed including Greg’s 14-year old daughter Emma, Greg and Cristina’s 5-year-old son Ryder, Dennis and Jack Dutton, and Craig Wadsworth.\n\nCathy Grossu told CBS news that Cristina texted her “We’re in trouble, emergency landing” after the plane took off. Then Grossu got an alert from Cristina’s phone.\n\nCathy Grossu said she and her daughter were texting \"all day long,\" including during the flight.\n\n\"Then she said something like 'We're in trouble, emergency landing.' And I texted back, 'What's wrong with the plane?'\" Grossu told CBS News. \"Then the next thing was [the SOS alert] that you get from your automatic Apple phones when you have an accident or something. And so I knew that something was wrong.\"\n\nGrossu called the airport. She said she was told there was a fire.\n\n\"That's when we knew that they crashed,\" Grossu said.\n\nThe NTSB has officially begun its investigation into the crash and said Friday that the black box from the plane has been recovered. A preliminary report from the investigation could be complete in 30 days. The plane was owned by Biffle's company GB Aviation Leasing LLC.\n\nNTSB board member Michael Graham said at a news conference Friday that it’s still unclear who was flying the plane. Both Dennis Dutton and Biffle were certified to fly the plane while Dutton’s son Jack was classified to fly single engine aircraft.\n\nThe plane crashed just short of the runway at Statesville Regional after it turned around upon takeoff. The plane hit trees, two light stanchions and the airport’s perimeter fence before it came to a stop.\n\nBiffle, 55, won 19 Cup Series races over a career that spanned two decades. He finished second in the points standings in 2005 and is one of two drivers to have both an Xfinity Series championship and a Truck Series championship. Biffle last raced full-time in NASCAR's top series in 2016 and got his last NASCAR national series win in 2019 when he won a Truck Series race.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.\n\nHe ended up explaining how his wife organizes her lingerie drawer.\n\n“I think she steams them,” he offered at one point, hoping to underscore the violation Melania Trump felt when, in his telling, FBI agents rummaged through the pristine undergarments — “sometimes referred to as panties” — during their 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn the realm of Trump tangents, it wasn’t the wildest, or angriest, or most bizarre.\n\nYet as the president hopes to refocus the nation’s attention on his economic record ahead of next year’s critical midterm elections, it was another reminder that his own focus often remains somewhat adrift.\n\nTrump did periodically discuss the economy in his 90-minute speech, which he called a “quick little stop” in Rocky Mount on the way to Mar-a-Lago for the holidays. He trumpeted a report this week that showed inflation unexpectedly cooling. He recounted an announcement he made earlier in the day on lowering some drug prices. He framed an uptick in the unemployment rate as a success since he’d fired so many government workers.\n\nSupporters behind him held signs reading “Lower Prices” and “Bigger Paychecks.” But even the visual cues couldn’t keep the president from veering well off-piste — often to the delight of his crowd.\n\nAs he was explaining the negotiations that went into the drug pricing scheme, attendees listened politely, if quietly, as he assumed a French accent to mimic President Emmanuel Macron during their pharmaceutical negotiations.\n\nThe audience really came alive when he reminisced about his opponent from nearly a decade ago.\n\n“I don’t know, beating Hillary was fun,” he said to roars. “Remember, she was a nasty person. I was going to use a B word. I said, ‘my wife would not be happy.’”\n\nThere are plenty of Trump advisers who would prefer the president focus more on the here-and-now, or — even better — the what’s-to-come. As he loses his political edge on the economy, many of his allies worry he’s lost touch with voter concerns and anxieties that propelled him into office in the first place.\n\nFriday’s rally was the latest in a roadshow of sorts that White House advisers have planned for Trump to hone his message on bringing down prices. He also delivered a primetime address to the nation this week meant to drive the message.\n\nMuch of his argument rests on having inherited what he says was an economic disaster from Joe Biden, though inflation was at 3% when he took office and is now only slightly lower. (And economists cautioned that last month’s inflation dip had a lot to do with shutdown-related distortions of economic data.)\n\nYet as is so often the case, the intended content of Trump’s speech was a target that didn’t always find an arrow.\n\nAs he hit the hour mark, his grievance list grew, encompassing the news media and Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the onetime loyalist who has dramatically broken with him and whom Trump now calls “Marjorie Traitor Brown.”\n\nHis aside about Melania’s unmentionables came amid a diatribe over the investigations that plagued him during his time out of office. He mused about awarding himself a massive sum in connection with complaints he filed against the Justice Department.\n\n“I am suing and I’m the one that’s supposed to settle. So maybe I’ll give myself $1 billion and give it all to charity,” he said.\n\nTrump found ample distractions in the crowd, including a group of glamorous women from the western part of the state who volunteer at his events. When he spotted a hat he liked, he explained how he could gauge its value.\n\n“I want gold thread, not mustard color. You know?” he said. “When you have a mustard-colored thread, don’t accept it.”\n\nRecalling the times he came to purchase furniture in North Carolina as a hotelier, he explained the exacting nature of the task.\n\n“The arm of a chair was very important to me. I said, ‘I like that chair, but this arm has to be a different shape,’” he said. He kept going: “I’m a very aesthetic person, believe me, except with women, I don’t care what a woman looks like. I used to say beautiful. Now I don’t care.”\n\nHe spent several minutes discussing his physical health amid questions about his stamina after appearing to doze off during multiple on-camera events recently. He pointed to the string of cognitive tests he claims to have aced. And he pledged to alert the nation should he find himself in decline.\n\n“When that time comes, I will let you know about it. In fact, you’ll probably find out about it just by watching,” he said. “But that time is not now, because I feel the same that I felt for 50 years.”\n\nIt was, in the end, the same type of speech Trump has been delivering now for more than 10 years, the “weave” in which he takes great pride. It has less to do with a calculated political message than free-association of whatever’s on his mind — which is often the people or entities he thinks have done him wrong.\n\nIf some of his fixations cause heartburn among his allies, though, Trump has a different view.\n\n“I think I’m probably very neurotic,” he said in Rocky Mount. “I always say controlled neuroses is good. Being neurotic, no good. But if it’s controlled, that’s okay. It gives you some energy.”",

    "description": "\"I've learned that the differences between right and wrong, good and evil are not as stark as we would like to believe. That good people can do bad things. That bad people can do good things.\"",
    "fullText": "Content warning: Discussions of abuse and sexual assault.\n\n\"When I was promoted to sergeant, I was assigned to the worst living unit in the state. Fights and assaults happened daily, including staff getting assaulted. After two years with the right staff, we were able to change the culture of the unit. When I retired, we had gone five years without any incident occurring in the unit. Leadership is very important because we, as staff, set the tone for the living units and the institution as a whole, whether it be county, state, or federal.\"\n\n\"I noticed the employees who had worked there forever were just stuck in their ways, never seeing things from the inmates' side. Bringing up ideas for improvement to create a better environment was never listened to. They thought that it was unnecessary to send inmates to reintegration halfway houses (so they wouldn't get completely thrown out into a world they wouldn't recognize anymore). Sometimes I look for these inmates on the state website, and most of them have ended up back in prison shortly after being released. That's pretty sad.\"\n\n\"I've seen inmates get beaten because they did something that brought attention to their gang. And yes, our prison had gangs. They didn't wear colors, but they had distinctive tattoos. Female staff at a male prison had to be extra vigilant; male inmates could be especially cunning and manipulative. If the money was right, I may consider doing it again, but I certainly would not want to be on the other side of the cell door.\"\n\n\"The sexual harassment as a female officer sucks. You don't eat the food if you're smart. In a facility that takes inmates from the streets, there's always a ton of drug users who want to continue handling fentanyl. The inmates were getting worse with the crap getting smuggled in. There were bad fights among gangs. It was not worth it. I never had any issues with any inmates once they were released. They were always polite and thankful for the fair treatment that they received. My mom was right to say, 'Treat others how you want to be treated.' Inmates aren't the only ones doing time, especially when you work in a prison. All the overtime that is required is really wild.\"\n\n\"4) Actual fights/substantial injuries are rare, but slap fights and rolling around on the ground are more common. 5) They snitch on each other constantly with guards. And they definitely have sex with guards. 6) Mostly, it's like being back in high school with cliques.\"\n\n\"There were good guards and bad ones, along with good inmates and bad ones as well. It all comes down to mutual human respect. Treat people the way you want to be treated, and you will do just fine, whether you are an employee or an inmate. As a guard, you learn to leave your own problems at home. Soon, you understand that these inmates can't do that. Everybody has good days and bad days. Keep the respect you would give any other human being.\"\n\n\"You're not allowed to disclose a single personal thing about yourself. Not an opinion, not an experience, nothing. I highly value the ability to be my authentic self, and I can't be my authentic self there. I feel like I'm a robot. It's definitely not for me personally, but I won't s*** on it because a lot of people are successful in that environment and really like it. Just for me personally, I'm a very flamboyant, goofy dork, and I like to always be my authentic, flamboyant, goofy dork self.\"\n\n\"They were interesting to talk to, and felt amazing to help. It was hard, hard work; it often felt like two steps forward and one back at the best of times, but I do miss the kids. Some could be violent, destructive, and scary, though, when things didn't go their way. With some kids, it felt like it was just at the drop of a hat. A lot of trauma, usually. Tough gig, but when things work, it's pretty awesome. About four out of five times, though, they end up reoffending, or worse. Also, you can NOT reveal pretty much any private information, and have to be very careful.\"\n\n\"I've heard prison work is better than jail because the people have been sentenced and generally there for a chunk of time. In my opinion, jail mental health was about teaching grounding skills, listening, apologizing that the nurse practitioner hadn't adjusted their meds, and forwarding those requests on again. Hard work to say the least.\"\n\n\"To remove people from their antisocial peers and environments, remove drugs (or as much/many as possible), and provide routine, structure, and good food, safety (for lots), and work on top of education and rehabilitation/treatment programs, means that they often are given the pause they need to reflect on their lives. Our prisons aren't perfect, and many come back, but overall, they're pretty good and can provide the opportunity to change lives.\"\n\n\"They could make phone calls through an approved list of family/friends. There were also spiritual care workers who tried to visit every unit once a week to spend time with the inmates in group settings and one-on-one. There were jobs available, and they were encouraged to get one, especially if they did not have family to send them any money (which most of them did not). Visits were allowed, but strip searches were required before returning to their unit.\"\n\n\"You see a lot of shit that you can never unsee, and it's not long before the optimism fades. I've been called heartless before for cracking some jokes. But at work, we all did it; it's part of how you cope. COs don't get the support they need, and it is an incredibly thankless job. It's a revolving door of employees coming and going because many new staff members don't last more than a couple of years. I was there for about five or six years myself before moving on to do something else, still in a similar field, but I wanted more opportunities to move up in my career.\"\n\n\"I had to park, walk probably a quarter mile, get a badge, get wanded, then a metal detector, a quick interview to see if I had contraband or had close associates either as prisoners or guards, my work bag was inspected, then I had to wait for an escort. And once I was in the conference room, I couldn't just get up and go to the bathroom; I had to buzz someone and tell them that I was moving. What also got to me was how sterile everything was; it was metal, cinderblock, and paint.\"\n\n\"I am so glad you said this. I am a juvenile probation officer, and it is SO complex. We do our hardest to keep kids OUT of the system, which nobody seems to ever believe. Detention and correction facilities are our LAST resort, but sometimes you just have to use them (at least that's our agency's philosophy). There isn't really a black-and-white answer to most things. As weird as it sounds, that's probably why I love my job. It's so challenging even if you see so much negativity—it's worth the one positive you get every once in a while.\"\n\nAlso in Internet Finds: \"Mama, Please Answer.

    "fullText": "As a mom of three teens, ages 14 to 18, I've had my share of years as the bringer of holiday magic. While I never welcomed the Elf on the Shelf into our home (no regrets), I did pretty much every other holiday tradition, including festive train rides and mall photos with Santa.\n\nIn the years when my kids were young, the weekends between Thanksgiving and New Year's were packed with holiday activities, leaving me exhausted and counting the days until they went back to school in January. The elation of Santa's arrival was paired with too-early wakeups and too many presents to assemble late at night. I loved seeing the joy in their eyes when they opened that LEGO set or butterfly-growing kit, but man, it was exhausting.\n\nThen came the tween years, which had me begging for someone — anyone — to join me on our annual drive through the neighborhood to look for the best holiday lights. These were the years when everything seemed like forced family fun, and I had to resort to heavy bribery (or light threats) to get anyone to come along.\n\nIt was only in the last year or so that I've seen a change in my kids. It started with my 18-year-old daughter planning a trip to the pumpkin patch with her high school friends. I had resigned myself to grocery-store pumpkins the last few years, as nobody seemed excited to make the effort to visit the pumpkin patch (and I wasn't paying pumpkin-patch prices for grumpy kids). When my daughter mentioned that she and a few friends were going to the pumpkin patch on a Friday night, I was surprised but secretly excited, because who doesn't love wholesome teen activities?\n\nThen, when I wasn't immediately busy decorating our house for Christmas after Thanksgiving, my 14-year-old son took it upon himself to hang the stockings and decorate the tree. My middle kid put up the outdoor Christmas lights without any adult prompting or assistance. Then, after skipping the nearby drive-thru lights experience for many years, the kids asked if we'd be going this year. Immediate yes.\n\nThese festive activities, which once felt optional and even embarrassing to my kids, now seem to matter to them once again. While there's nothing like those early years with kids who are all in on Santa and his holiday magic, I'm finding a different kind of joy in this stage. I love watching my teenagers take it upon themselves to fill our house with the holiday spirit, not because I asked them to, but because they wanted to.\n\nFor years, I carried the responsibility of creating holiday magic. Now I see that letting go made room for something better. As my kids inch closer to leaving the nest, I love seeing them bring new life to our family traditions.",

    "title": "5 of the most unusual Christmas traditions that non-Americans won't understand",
    "description": "Every country has its own Christmas traditions, but from hiding a pickle ornament to drinking egg whites, the US has some seriously unusual ones.",
    "fullText": "Christmas is the time for gift-giving, spending time with family, reflecting on the year, and … running around bars dressed up as a drunk Santa?\n\nLike any other nation, the US has its own holiday traditions that might seem confusing to people from other countries.\n\nWe've chosen five Christmas traditions that are as American as fireworks on the Fourth of July and turkey on Thanksgiving.\n\nMany Americans have a pickle ornament for their Christmas tree. Traditionally, the ornament is supposed to be hidden somewhere on the tree, and the first child to find it receives an extra present, but it's unclear where this tradition started. One website, Why Christmas, points to two potential origin stories.\n\nThe first legend goes that two boys were killed by an evil innkeeper, who put their bodies in a pickle barrel, but a passing Saint Nicholas was able to magically revive them.\n\nThe other suggests that a German-born soldier in the American Civil War was imprisoned, and begged for one last pickle before he died. A guard took pity on him and gave him a pickle, which miraculously sustained him.\n\nAnother theory posits that the pickle ornament got its start in Germany, per The New York Times, though few people there have heard of it. It is more likely that it was a marketing stunt invented by those importing glass decorations from Germany.\n\nWhile Christmas trees as we know them are said to have originated in Germany in the 16th century and brought to German settlements in Pennsylvania, the popcorn garland is an American thing.\n\nAs Christmas trees were a relatively new idea, people had to get creative with their décor. Apparently, recently transplanted German Americans favored using fruits and nuts, thus turning to popcorn, which was ubiquitous.\n\nPer The Daily Meal, this practice was originally meant to help feed birds during harsh winters.\n\nHowever, the rest of the world might have a hard time understanding why everyone's favorite movie theater snack would appear on a Christmas tree.\n\nAccording to The Spruce Eats, eggnog has its roots in posset, a punch with ale, raw eggs, and figs, served warm. British monks drank posset all the way back in the 13th century.\n\nIt eventually crossed over to America, where it was renamed eggnog. Its first known use dates back to 1775, according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nEggnog typically consists of egg yolks beaten with sugar, milk, and/or cream and your choice of alcohol. Rum, whiskey, and sherry are all acceptable options.\n\nWhile eggnog might not seem that strange to Americans — even George Washington had his own recipe — it's a hard sell to the rest of the world, who might not find drinking eggs appetizing, let alone when mixed with rum.\n\nChristmas bonfires are a Christmas Eve tradition in Louisiana, where tree-shaped bonfires are lit up on the levees that keep the Mississippi River under control.\n\nIt's a Cajun tradition, Cajuns being the descendants of French Canadians driven from French colonies in Canada by the British in the 18th century. The bonfires are said to help Papa Noel (Santa Claus) find his way in the dark.\n\nHundreds of raging fires up and down the Mississippi River might not be everyone's idea of an idyllic Christmas Eve.",

    "description": "When my grandmother got sick, she finally let go of perfection, and taught me the freedom that comes with accepting imperfection.",
    "fullText": "My grandmother strove for perfection, convinced that it was an attainable goal if only you worked hard enough.\n\nThis meant eating less to lose weight. Food deprivation became a family bonding activity when my grandmother was on a diet. Diets lasted decades. We had marathon cleaning weekends while friends went to the mall. Play clothes were swapped out for school clothes for our rare trips to Burger King. Random dust checks were performed to ensure vacuuming of floors was done correctly. I'll never forget her finger with a perfectly manicured nail grazing the cool Italian tile floor. Chore lists graced our refrigerator in the same way my friends' quizzes and pictures graced theirs.\n\nMy grandmother wanted and demanded order, believing it led to perfection. My childhood was spent trying to please. She did not expect more from us than she did from herself, though. I hold many memories of Gram chastising herself for her too-big thighs or her less-than-stellar self-control around chocolate. It was a weakness that caused her significant guilt.\n\nYears later, as I began my own journey toward motherhood, I vowed that my children would not endure what I had. I would allow them to make messes. That dog I always wanted, but was never allowed to have because pets were dirty, would complete the large family I also always wanted. Perfection would become what it was meant to be, a foolish ideal — not a reality to strive for at all costs.\n\nInstead, I repeated exactly what I knew. My kids had to have matching outfits, picture-perfect Christmas cards, and all the things perfection required. I would clean and exercise until I reached the point of exhaustion. I worked out through all four pregnancies and directly after.\n\nI recall throwing a birthday party for my son. He was turning 3 or 4. Someone commented on how great I looked. \"Nicole makes sure everything is always perfect,\" someone else said. I reveled in the praise. Gram heard the comment and smiled. We shared a common bond. When one of us inched closer to it, the other one felt proud.\n\nThe exhaustion of parenting four kids and attempting to create the perfect world for them and me was intense. I was stuck in a cycle. It would not break until one sunny fall day. I was running around attempting to clean and wrangle the kids for lunch. The plan was to work out after they took their naps. The phone rang, and my grandmother greeted me on the other end. All I heard was the word sick. I assumed it was regarding my grandfather, who had had heart problems for decades. I thought perhaps it was another heart attack.\n\n\"No, baby, it's me. I'm sick.\" It was shocking. Gram had lived a life of such order and perfection. She was in her 70s and active. She took only one pill for high blood pressure. Gram had Stage 4 ovarian cancer, which meant we discovered it late. We looked up the statistical odds of survival. My grandmother had a terminal illness.\n\nThe diagnosis changed her. For the first time, her constant need for perfection seemed foolish. Weight didn't matter, nor did matching a purse to shoes to a blouse. When Gram lost her hair, one of her most beautiful features, and found herself struggling to keep the house clean, she understood things had to change. Maybe a wig wouldn't be so bad. Maybe hiring someone to come in and help was OK. Her new favorite saying became, \"Don't sweat it.\" What mattered was time and how she spent it.\n\nWhen she saw me working myself to death to provide a perfect life for my family, Gram realized I had become just like her. She said, \"Perfection isn't worth it. It isn't even real.\" Then, she asked a question that changed everything for me.\"Did you do your best?\" When I answered that I had, she said, \"Well, that's all you can do then.\"\n\nIt changed the way I lived my life and significantly reduced the pressure on me.\n\nWatching her health diminish and understanding that she had limited time helped Gram realize what was important. Perfection and holding onto unrealistic expectations and ideals no longer fit into her life. Watching her learn this lesson allowed me to learn it alongside her. She taught me so that I didn't have to wait until I was in my 70s battling a terminal illness. When I remember her now, I am forever grateful.",

    "description": "Although moving to a small beach town in a different country had its perks, it was lonely. I struggled to fit in as neither a local nor a tourist.",
    "fullText": "In 2017, I moved from Los Angeles to Panama to teach English.\n\nMy first year in the country was filled with excitement. I was based in Panama City, and I found it easy to make friends through the many dance classes and meet-ups.\n\nMy social life felt full, and most weekends were spent wandering through Casco Viejo (the downtown area), trying to find the best rooftop bars and underground nightclubs playing a mix of Reggaeton and pop music.\n\nSoon, though, the fast-paced lifestyle, combined with the constant traffic and sweltering heat, became overwhelming. I grew tired of living in a city of millions and craved a slower pace.\n\nSo, I relocated to a small coastal town called Playa Venao, which is about 200 miles and a five-hour drive from Panama City.\n\nI hoped I could quickly build a community there as I did in the capital, but it didn't come nearly as easily to me.\n\nAlthough Playa Venao is now more developed, at the time I lived there, it was primarily a handful of hotels, hostels, and homes scattered along the shoreline.\n\nA single road split the town: real estate on one side, jungle and cow pastures on the other. Only a few hundred people called Playa Venao their full-time home.\n\nI was living in a place where there were more trees than buildings. In fact, I could pick and eat papayas, coconuts, and mangos straight from the trees on the property of my rental.\n\nThe school I worked at was quite small and, because of our remote location, nature often became our third instructor. Children shared their outdoor play area with centipedes and howler monkeys, and splashed in the nearby stream and waterfall.\n\nBetween teaching, I spent my days peacefully walking along the beach and hiking near the river. I was no longer overwhelmed by the sounds of honking horns and revving engines. Instead, I was soothed by the songs of exotic birds.\n\nMy social life wasn't bustling like it was before, though at first, I enjoyed meeting people from all over the world who were in the area on vacation.\n\nBut once the novelty of being somewhere new wore off, I started to see the downside of living in a place that felt like paradise.\n\nI struggled to find my place in a community that felt largely split between locals and tourists.\n\nI was a bit of an in-between: I'd only been in the country for a year, so I wasn't a local … but I'd been living in this beach town for a few months, so I wasn't a tourist, either.\n\nBuilding community with transient tourists seemed impossible.\n\nMany tourists I met spent their time surfing or talking about surfing, not surprising given Playa Venao's reputation as one of the best surf spots in the world.\n\nUnfortunately, as a beginner, I couldn't keep up with the experienced surfers during conversations or out on the water.\n\nWhenever I'd meet someone who had more to talk about than waves, we only had a week or two to get to know each other because they were vacationing where I was living.\n\nI felt I never had time to share more about myself beyond surface-level topics, like work, hobbies, and where I was from. These limited interactions made my relationships feel shallow and made me feel like I didn't have any real friends.\n\nOver time, the loneliness ate away at me, and I grew tired of reintroducing myself to a new tourist every other week. So, I tried connecting with the locals. This wasn't an easy task.\n\nThe director of the school I was working at had warned me that locals were often closed off to newcomers. I felt it.\n\nOne night, I managed to play a game of pool with some locals at a nearby bar. I thought I'd made a breakthrough, but the next morning, the same people who had been friendly the night before wouldn't give me the time of day — it hurt.\n\nI could understand why a tight-knit community of people who grew up together might be wary of trusting outsiders. However, it was hard being treated like just another visitor in the place I lived.\n\nAfter weeks of failing to make lasting connections, part of me wanted to call it quits and return to the city. I missed feeling like I belonged and having a calendar filled with dance classes and happy hours with friends.\n\nHowever, I'd committed to working through the whole school year, and I didn't want to walk away from the children — some of the only people I had created bonds with.\n\nFinally, one conversation with my mom helped me reevaluate and give my new home another shot.\n\nAfter listening to my sorrows, my mom reminded me that life wasn't happening to me, it was happening for me.\n\nI needed to embrace each moment, even the not-so-great ones, and treat my situation as an opportunity. So, instead of ruminating on what I lacked, I focused on appreciating more of what I had.\n\nTo ease my frustration of not being able to pop over to a movie theater or hop into a nightclub like in the city, I found entertainment within nature.\n\nI'd wake up early to enjoy the colorful sunrises and collect different rocks and shells along the shore. I'd pass the time by going for a swim or setting up my speaker and dancing barefoot in the sand.\n\nFocusing on my internal peace helped me to stop forcing connections, and I allowed them to form naturally.\n\nI stopped viewing relationships as temporary experiences. It didn't matter if a friendship lasted five days or four months — I cherished every connection made.\n\nSoon, routine visits to the local coffee shop led to casual chats with the barista. I ordered the same dish so often that one day, they wrote out the recipe for it and gave it to me — it kick-started our friendship.\n\nMore connections began to blossom as I prioritized attending community events, from kayak races to surfing competitions. As time passed, locals could see that I was consistently making an effort, and perhaps they started to view me as less of a tourist.\n\nMeanwhile, I was forming stronger relationships with the parents of the children I worked with, and they helped advocate for me to the other locals. I'd also started to build a strong connection with my coworker, who became one of my first real friends in the area.\n\nWith a little bit of patience and a mindset shift, I eventually found the community I craved and ended up staying in Playa Venao for about a year.\n\nIn that time, I learned that sticking through uncomfortable situations — and staying present for both the good and the bad — can lead to unexpected peace and happiness.",

    "fullText": "Dating is difficult at any age. Dating when you have a child is complicated. But, when you decide to date after the passing of your partner, there's even more to consider. I was 48 when my husband succumbed to cancer. My daughter was almost 10.\n\nWhy would I want to date? I was heartbroken. A piece of my life and my entire vision of the future had been ripped away from me. I didn't want love. I wasn't interested in a replacement. I'd lost the illusion of forever.\n\nI just wanted conversation, companionship, and a new way of looking forward and reimagining. But, any kind of reimagining requires imagination and reconciliation. I was parenting a traumatized child while also trying to care for myself.\n\nI didn't tell my daughter I was going on dates at first. I didn't bring anyone to meet her until I'd had a few positive dates. I didn't introduce her to anyone I didn't think of as potential friend, a good person.\n\nI was clear with everyone I went out with that I wasn't looking for something permanent and that I certainly wasn't looking for a new dad for my daughter. My daughter adored her dad, and rightfully so. She had thoughts on the few people I did introduce her to:\n\n\"I don't have a good feeling about him. Even if he got me a good present.\"\n\nAnd, eventually, \"He seems pretty chill.\"\n\nSolo parenting is not single parenting. My daughter didn't split time between me and another parent. I couldn't tell a potential date, \"my daughter's with her other parent this weekend — I'm free.\"\n\nI had to define what my boundaries were and enforce them. So, no one could be in the space I shared with my daughter. I couldn't make him dinner, invite him in for drinks.\n\nThere's also not a lot of free time for a solo parent with a full-time job. I needed to be there for soccer, Girl Scouts, school plays. Those were nonnegotiable. I wouldn't date someone who wanted me to prioritize them over my daughter.\n\nDating as a widowed parent means accepting a need for connection and feeling guilty for wanting it at the same time.\n\nWhat did it say about me? Did it mean that my feelings about my husband hadn't been sincere? Was it fair to the men I went out with?\n\nI wanted conversation with people who didn't know me in my married life, people who could see present and future me, but who also wouldn't push too much for a future with me.\n\nDespite all of the challenges, I'm not only making it work, I'm thriving. I've met some really good people who want connection, whatever that looks like, in this iteration of our lives.",

    "description": "Newly released documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein probe reveal some of the high-profile figures who rubbed elbows with the financier.",
    "fullText": "The Justice Department on Friday released thousands of documents related to its investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier.\n\nThe trove of files, many of which were redacted, includes uncredited and undated photos that provide a snapshot into Epstein's inner life and circle.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. Nine years later, the financier was charged with the sex trafficking of minors. He died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody.\n\nSome of the images are of his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on multiple felony counts, including the sex-trafficking of a minor. Other photos show the wide spectrum of high-profile figures Epstein came into contact with during his life.\n\nThe images include former President Bill Clinton, billionaire Richard Branson, actor Kevin Spacey, and The Rolling Stones lead vocalist Mick Jagger, among others.\n\nThe photos are not evidence of wrongdoing, nor do they detail what relationship the financier had with any of the figures. Some of the figures aren't pictured with Epstein.\n\nHere's what the Friday document dump included. The following list is not exhaustive.\n\nClinton has shown up several times in investigations into Epstein, including in the flight logs of Epstein's private jet. Clinton traveled internationally with Epstein on several occasions after his two terms as president ended in 2001.\n\nThere have been no public accusations of wrongdoing against Clinton related to his friendship with Epstein.\n\nA spokesperson for Clinton did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn a statement posted on social media, Angel Ureña, a spokesperson to the former president, suggested that Clinton knew nothing about Epstein's criminal activity.\n\n\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light,\" he wrote. \"The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.\"\n\nA legal representative for Jagger did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department included no information about where or when the photo was taken.\n\nBranson and a spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Similar photos of Branson and Epstein were released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this month.\n\nA spokesperson for Spacey did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Jackson's estate did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Tucker did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJean-Luc Brunel was a French modeling agent who founded Karin Models in 1977. He also founded MC2 Model Management with funding from Epstein.\n\nBrunel was found hanged in an apparent suicide in his prison cell in 2022. He was being held in a Paris prison while awaiting trial on charges of rape of a minor and trafficking of minors for sexual exploitation.\n\nA legal representative for Brunel's estate did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFormer Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson has faced public scrutiny for her associations with Epstein. Her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, relinquished his royal titles earlier this year amid ongoing public inquiry into his own friendship with Epstein.\n\nA representative for Ferguson did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.",
    "fullText": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.\n\nYesterday’s CPI report, showing inflation of 2.7 percent — well below the expected 3.1 percent — was bad political news for Democrats. Since “Liberation Day” in April, when President Trump rolled out tariffs aimed at resetting global trade in favor of U.S. companies, the left and their media allies have warned voters that the White House’s actions would clobber our economy and set inflation soaring.\n\nIt hasn’t happened. The tariffs have only modestly boosted prices. Instead, the Trump agenda of higher energy production, lower budget deficits and lighter regulation has brought inflation down. While inflation averaged 5 percent annually under former President Joe Biden, and in four years jumped by nearly 22 percent, as of November it is rising at 2.7 percent.\n\nWould you remind me again who created the “affordability crisis?”\n\nAs inflation continues to recede from the lofty 9 percent level recorded under Biden, voters may realize just how much damage was done by Joe’s budget-busting big government spending.\n\nAnother narrative that is under fire is that Trump-backed AI is a gift to billionaires but is going to destroy U.S. employment, much like the trade pacts of the 1990s that sent jobs overseas. But two new studies counter that claim. As it turns out, AI is actually creating jobs for Americans.\n\nIn its year-end note to investors, investment firm Vanguard writes that AI is not responsible for slowing job growth. They point to data showing that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nAccompanying graphs show hiring in AI-affected occupations growing at 1.7 percent during the two years mid-2023 to mid-2025, compared to only 1.0 percent pre-COVID, and compared to 0.8 percent for other kinds of jobs. Similarly, real wage growth for AI-involved hires is advancing at 3.8 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for other occupations.\n\nThe authors of the study suggest that “current AI systems are generally enhancing worker productivity and shifting workers’ tasks toward higher-value activities.”",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine and voiced confidence the Kremlin would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv doesn't agree to Russia's conditions in peace talks.\n\nSpeaking at his tightly orchestrated annual news conference that lasted about 4 1/2 hours, Putin declared that Russian forces have “fully seized strategic initiative” and would make more gains by year's end.\n\nIn the early days of the conflict in 2022, Ukraine's forces thwarted an attempt by Russia’s larger, better-equipped army, to capture the capital of Kyiv. But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow's troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it's not the lightning advance many expected.\n\n“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.\n\nPutin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs during a broadcast that mixes criticism of the West with promises of more social payments. Although he is sometimes asked about his personal life, he gives scant details.\n\nThis year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nWhile the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.\n\nRussian demands remain unchanged\n\nPutin praised Trump's peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn't elaborate.\n\nHe wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.\n\nThe Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”\n\nPutin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\n\n″The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,\" Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”\n\nCommenting on Zelenskyy's statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn't made such a move.\n\nPutin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin's aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump's recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn't consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin says seizing Russian assets will backfire\n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its Western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nUsing Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong\n\nPutin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.\n\nBut the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.\n\nAsked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved — a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.\n\nThe news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.",

    "fullText": "Dec. 19 (UPI) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish President Karol Nawrocki discussed mutual concerns during a private meeting in Warsaw on Friday.\n\nThe meeting was the first between the two European leaders since Nawrocki was inaugurated as Poland's new president on Aug. 6, and they discussed security matters largely involving Russia, along with economic concerns and historical issues, according to the Kyiv Independent.\n\nZelensky said the meeting was the start of a new chapter for the relationship between the two nations and is \"bad news for Russia.\"\n\n\"I very much hope that this visit opens a new and even more substantial chapter in our relations -- the relations between Ukraine and Poland, the relations not merely of neighbors, but of two European pillars without which there will simply be no freedom in our part of Europe, because there will be no security,\" Zelensky told media afterward during a joint press conference.\n\n\"Russia wants discord, wants to destroy and dismantle such a strong alliance -- the alliance of two peoples of many generations of Ukraine and Poland,\" Zelensky said. \"We will not allow them to do this.\"\n\nHe said Ukrainian and Polish independence deters Russian aggression in Eastern Europe but warned that Russia would continue into Poland if Ukraine were to fall amid the nearly four-year war there that began when Russia invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNawrocki said Poland has supported Ukraine during the war and might exchange MiG-29 fighters in return for Ukrainian drone technology.\n\nPoland's president has criticized Ukraine's desire to join the European Union and NATO, both of which Poland is a member state.\n\nThe two presidents also discussed the Volyn massacres of 1943-1944, during which Ukrainian Insurgent Army members killed tens of thousands of Poles in Nazi-occupied territory in western Ukraine.\n\nRetaliatory attacks caused the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians, and the historical conflict remains a source of tension between Polish and Ukrainian leaders.\n\nThe meeting between the two presidents followed Zelensky's trip to Belgium, where he met with European Union leaders in Brussels and secured a $105.5 billion, interest-free loan for Ukraine.\n\nThe loan is in place of allocating funds to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets, which EU leaders considered but declined after failing to reach a consensus.\n\nZelensky said the loaned money will either help fund Ukraine's defense against Russia or support rebuilding the nation if Russia agrees to a peace deal and ends its aggression, The Independent reported.",

    "fullText": "Emphasis this year is on nostalgia as present day feels ‘a bit more uncertain’, say trend experts\n\nTinsel, DIY tree decorations, deep burgundy drapes – and Home Alone on VHS. Christmas has gone retro on TikTok, and in people’s living rooms.\n\nThe app has reported a surge in Christmas decor videos, with an emphasis on nostalgia as users embrace festive looks from bygone eras. For younger TikTokers, that means the 90s.\n\nMore than 8,000 videos have been posted under the hashtag #90sChristmas, celebrating a look that includes multicoloured tree lights, homemade felt ornaments and – in a post with nearly 4m views – VHS tapes of Christmas classics such as the Macaulay Culkin caper.\n\nTikTok said Christmas decor videos had increased by 100% over the past 12 months, with commentators saying the emphasis on nostalgia reflects a need for stability in uncertain times.\n\n“There is a sense of inherent nostalgia in these trends,” says Hugh Metcalf, editor of the interior decor website Livingetc.com. “These are not super-contemporary looks. It’s a search for comfort from yesteryear when things right now are a bit more uncertain.”\n\nWGSN, a consumer trend forecasting firm, says the 90s Christmas trend indicates a general rising nostalgia for that decade, which also came across during Halloween as an embrace of “tacky decor” pushed at notions of what constitutes good taste.\n\nMetcalf says TikTok is “super influential” for Christmas aesthetics across all generations, with online influencers having greater sway over festive aesthetics than they do over interior decor trends across the rest of the year, which tend to be the province of design professionals.\n\n“These Christmas trends are for things people have seen and experienced before,” Metcalf adds. “It’s appealing to personal histories and our sense of emotion, a bit of relief from trying to get the newest, most interesting interior design idea.”\n\nEven more popular than the 90s take this year is Ralph Lauren Christmas, riffing on the American designer’s signature looks with deep colours, rich wooden panelling and green tartan prints. TikTokers has also offered tips on how to afford a festive take on the luxury brand if you’re on a budget.\n\nWGSN says the Ralph Lauren yuletide aesthetic represents a broader push for “new classic iterations and traditional vibes” over the Christmas season. Describing the trend as “cross-generational nostalgia”, WGSM says it is manifesting itself in looks like cosy knits, windowsill candles and bannister garlands.\n\n“Explorations of these classic looks are gaining strength even among younger consumers,” says Cassandra Gagnon, a WGSN strategist.\n\nIf the late 20th century isn’t distant enough as we peer through the retro tinsel from our 2025 vantage point, then WGSN also reports interest in “opulent antiquity”, including velvet Christmas stockings and tree skirts. It means terms such as “Little Women Christmas” – inspired by the Louisa May Alcott classic – are also trending on the platform.\n\nTime has also been kinder to The Holiday, a romantic comedy film which received some negative reviews on its release nearly two decades ago but has become a decor influence on TikTok this year as well. Named after the film’s director, the #NancyMeyersAesthetic hashtag has more than 35,000 videos – Meyers also directed Father of the Bride and The Parent Trap – with the Christmas iteration focusing on warm interiors and the traditional festive look seen elsewhere on the app.\n\nBut in terms of the soundtrack for the season, another decade wins: the 80s. Last Christmas by Wham! is the most searched Christmas song on TikTok so far this month.",

    "fullText": "(NewsNation) —The sports world is mourning the loss of NASCAR legend Greg Biffle, who was killed in a plane crash Thursday alongside his wife and two children.\n\nBiffle’s private jet went down minutes after takeoff as it attempted to return to Statesville Regional Airport in North Carolina. The National Transportation Safety Board is leading an investigation into the crash and will arrive Friday to examine debris. A doorbell camera from a nearby home caught the moment the plane crashed, bursting into flames.\n\nHHS to overhaul childhood vaccine schedule to recommend fewer shots\n\n“My blinds were closed, but it was a little bit open, so I kind of, like, saw some red flares and a little bit after that, I just heard, like, a big ruckus that shook the house,” resident Brevin Renwick said.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families confirmed the deaths of Greg and Cristina Biffle, their son Ryder and daughter Emma, along with Dennis Dutton and his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth.\n\n“We are devastated by the loss of our loved ones,” the statement reads. “This tragedy has left all of our families heartbroken beyond words.”\n\nUS pauses visa lottery in wake of Brown University, MIT shootings\n\n“Greg and Cristina were devoted parents and active philanthropists whose lives were centered around their young son Ryder and Greg’s daughter Emma,” the statement continued. “Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives.”\n\nBiffle was known for his work on and off the track. An experienced pilot, Biffle used his private helicopter to help deliver supplies to North Carolina residents stranded by flooding brought on by Hurricane Helene in September 2024. At the time, NewsNation’s Anna Kooiman interviewed the family about how they used their skills and connections to deliver food and medical supplies to stranded residents in the region.\n\n“We got tagged in a bunch of posts on Facebook,” Cristina Biffle said in the interview. “There’s a family with two small kids and an Airbnb that got stuck, and they’re looking for helicopters. And this is before we knew anything that had actually happened up there. And I told Greg, I said, Hey, listen, we have a helicopter. Should we go? And he said, ‘OK, I’ll try.’ And that’s kind of when the whole thing started.”\n\nMike Tyson says marijuana has been a ‘game-changer’\n\nAs the investigation into Thursday’s crash continues, officials said it would take time to clear the debris from the tarmac.\n\nRoy Yelton, who knew Biffle for decades, says he would want everyone to go on.\n\n“I know it will hit me more when I realize it is just really over. His friendship will always be there in my heart,” he said.",

Adam Hastings looked for Jamie Dobie with a cross-field kick and he was crudely taken out in the air by Ben Vellacott.\n\nThe penalty was kicked to the corner, the Glasgow pack rumbled over and Hiddleston touched down to put Glasgow two scores clear.\n\nEdinburgh finally showed signs of life in attack and engineered a golden opportunity for Darcy Graham out wide, but Ollie Smith, outstanding all day, covered superbly to bundle the little winger into touch.\n\nThe capital side did make things more interesting when Gilchrist barrelled over – though replays suggested he may have been short of the line when he grounded the ball - to bring his side back within seven.\n\nAny hint of a late comeback was extinguished when substitute Stephen finished off a rolling line-out maul to seal the bonus-point win and secure a handy aggregate cushion to take into next week's second leg at Murrayfield.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: Smith, Steyn (c), McDowall, Tuipulotu, Dobie; Hastings, Horne; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Afshar, Lancaster.\n\nEdinburgh: Goosen, Graham, O'Conor, Currie, Van der Merwe; Scott, Vellacott; Schoeman, Ashman, O Blyth-Lafferty, Young, Gilchrist, McConnell, Richardson, Bradbury.\n\nReplacements: Harris, Venter, Hill, Hunter-Hill, Douglas, McAlpine, Thompson, Davidson.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca insisted that speculation around his future would not distract his squad before facing Newcastle - but that was not how it looked for 45 minutes on Saturday.\n\nEven before kick-off, Maresca appeared to question Chelsea's focus on buying only youth, suggesting having more experienced players is \"invaluable\".\n\nThe Blues then did not get going at St James' Park, a ground where they had lost 15 times in the Premier League era, and found themselves 2-0 down through a pair of first-half goals from striker Nick Woltemade.\n\nSo poor was the first half that Chelsea gave up an expected goals figure of 1.97 - their worst in a first 45 minutes for more than two years. They were error-prone at the back, wasteful in possession, out battled and failed to register a shot on target.\n\nThe lack of performance was staggering given Chelsea had produced an accomplished display when beating Everton at home last weekend. That form was \n\nDespite the improvement by Chelsea they were still reliant on a key call going their way as Newcastle controversially saw penalty shouts waved away moments before Pedro equalised when Trevoh Chalobah clattered into Anthony Gordon in the box.\n\nIt felt at times that Maresca's post-match comments from last week - in which he said \"many people\" had caused his \"worst 48 hours\" since joining the club - were continuing to impact the players.\n\nSince those comments, the Italian had been linked with Manchester City - speculation he labelled \"100 per cent\" unfounded - and had his relationship with the hierarchy continually to be questioned.\n\nHe also offered some thoughts on the make-up of his squad prior to the match that suggested he would welcome a bit more experience.\n\nEarlier in the week, he said: \"I love the squad, I love young players\" and before kick-off he told TNT: \"I'm very happy. I just focus on what I can control - pitch-side - knowing that there is always noise you need to manage.\"\n\nHowever, he then added: \"When you have 20 and 21-year-olds and a player who is 30 or 31, and he starts to say something to them, it's invaluable. But it's the strategy of the club.\"\n\nWas this just another example of Maresca lowering expectations and highlighting what part of the project was in his control?\n\nHe was also fighting for the players, even earning a booking for dissent in the second half as they managed a creditable fightback.\n\nThis was only the fourth time in the Premier League that Chelsea avoided defeat having been two or more goals down at half-time. Ultimately both teams had chances to win in an entertaining end to the match.\n\nYet, despite Maresca showing his commitment, it remains an open question whether this ongoing power struggle could affect Chelsea's players going forward.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe said his side were denied a \"stonewall\" penalty in their 2-2 draw with Chelsea - so, does he have a point?\n\nChelsea defender Trevoh Chalobah barged Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon to the ground inside the penalty area in the 53rd minute at St James' Park.\n\nHowe and the home fans demanded a penalty but, following a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) review, the on-field decision not to award a penalty was upheld.\n\nNewcastle led 2-1 at the time and the full-time whistle was met with boos following the perceived injustice, as the hosts had to settle for a point after losing a 2-0 lead.\n\nClarifying the decision, the Premier League Match Centre wrote on X: \"The referee's call of no penalty to Newcastle was checked and confirmed by VAR - with the contact from Chalobah on Gordon deemed to be side-to-side in a shielding action and the ball within playing distance.\"\n\nHowe, whose side have dropped a league-high 13 points from winning positions, said: \"I thought it was stonewall penalty and the defender went into it with too much aggression.\n\n\"Anywhere else on the pitch, that's a free-kick. So I'm really disappointed that wasn't given.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Sport: \"Chalobah didn't play the ball and I felt it was more than just shoulder to shoulder.\n\n\"I felt at least the referee could have a look at it again. I think the wording from the match centre was it was shielding the ball out of play - but Chalobah definitely wasn't shielding anything and so, for me, Chelsea were lucky there.\"",

The fact the initial contact was with the thigh was what prevented referee Luke Pearce from producing a 20-minute red card.\n\nDespite the numerical disadvantage, the Chiefs continued to fight and hit the front after a long TMO review.\n\nCampbell Ridl won a 50:50 with Caluori after Ivan van Zyl let the Exeter box-kick go over his head.\n\nThe ball bounced up and hit Ridl in the face before he took control and set up Varney for an easy finish, with replays inconclusive as to whether the ball touched his hand for a knock-on in the process.\n\nRidl's Prem debut was marked with a trip to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on that cut out Hartley's pass and denied Caluori a second score, with the penalty try awarded for Sarries to retake the lead.\n\nBut Caluori eventually got the second try his performance deserved after Malins' good play on the other side, with the ball worked across to Elliot Daly, who found his wing with a high, looping pass before Caluori dived into the corner with his last action of the match.\n\nThe best was left for last as two quick tries from Fisilau set up a grandstand finish.\n\nFirst, he powered over at the back of a maul, before then weaving his way through to give the Chiefs a one-point lead.\n\nExeter survived a strong drive from the hosts as the defence managed to hold the ball up on the line, before Farrell missed a penalty attempt that would have retaken the lead for the Men in Black.\n\nAnd with the final action of the game, Slade turned the ball over to sprint through into the corner and wrap up the points for the visitors.\n\nSaracens: Daly; Caluori, Tompkins, Hartley, Malins; Farrell, Van Zyl; Carre, Dan, Street, Isiekwe, Tizard, Gonzalez, Earl, Willis\n\nReplacements: George, Mawi, Riccioni, Wilson, Onyeama-Christie, C Bracken, Burke, Segun\n\nExeter: Woodburn; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Ikitau, Ridl; Skinner, Varney; Goodrick-Clarke, Yeandle, Tchumbadze, Jenkins, Zambonin, Hooper, Roots, Fisilau\n\nReplacements: Heaven, Sio, Roots, Pearson, James, Chapman, Haydon-Wood, Rigg\n\nSin-bin: Hooper [27], Ridl [45]",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the Rams, Dodgers, UCLA and Mick Cronin, as well as the NBA Cup.",
    "fullText": "Once again, Bill Plaschke has literally jinxed another Southern California sports team with his proclamation questions regarding the Rams:\n\nWho’s going to stop the unstoppable offense?\n\nWho’s going to score on the persistent defense?\n\nWho’s going to outwit the coaching genius?\n\nI have the answers, and it's not just Seattle. It's their special teams, their defensive backs and it's coach Sean McVay's play-calling. Well, maybe the referees … but that's for another day.\n\nThanks again for the poison-pen article, Bill.\n\nJust four days after Bill Plaschke promised that the Rams would win the Super Bowl, the team blew a big lead and lost in a stinker to the Seahawks. Like my mother told me when I was a kid: Be honest, respect others, and bet against Plaschke — you'll win every time!\n\nCan we quit the Rams praise now? They can’t tackle anyone that gets past the line of scrimmage. Coach Sean McKay and defensive coordinator Chris Shula went into a shell as the Rams lost the game to the Seahawks and any chance of a long playoff run.\n\nHow many more times do we need to see Emmanuel Forbes chasing a receiver because of a blown coverage or missing an assignment and giving up a big play. The secondary is the weak link in the Rams defense and he’s absolutely a broken link. Chris Shula, please put someone else back there. The mascot Rampage would be a better choice than Forbes.\n\nBill Plaschke writes of the Rams: \"Who's going to score on the persistent defense?\" Maybe the Lions with 34 points?\n\nWilliam P. Bekkala\nWest Hollywood\n\nBill Plaschke's Rams encomium is puzzling. During the course of the game I watched, Detroit moved through the Rams defense like Sherman through Georgia. This was, at best, park football. The first team that exploits the Rams defense as the Lions did and consistently moves the ball on offense will defeat the Rams.\n\nJust when the Rams thought that they solved their kicking situation, they lost another game because of a missed field goal. After the game, they must have been kicking themselves.\n\nIt looks like the Bills are going to win the Super Bowl, because Plaschke wrote, \"The Bills? Not ever.\"\n\nThose who think what the Dodgers are doing is sound financial decision-making only have to look a little in front of their noses. The Dodgers have now committed over a billion dollars in deferred salary. What happens when that bill becomes due? They will commit another billion in the same buy-it-now, pay-it-later mode.\n\nOther teams can’t and shouldn’t follow this lead, which eventually fans pay for in higher prices for everything Dodger related. We will have their management to thank for the impending 2027 MLB labor stoppage and no baseball at that time.\n\nJust when you think that things could not possibly get any worse in Westwood, UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond adds five more years to Mick Cronin’s contract.\n\nKudos to the Knicks for apparently deciding not to hang a banner to signify their NBA Cup championship, despite not winning a title since 1973, whereas the Lakers have won 11 since that time. Hopefully new ownership of the Lakers will reverse course and take down the Lakers’ barren banner for their 2023 Cup championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "description": "“It’s Christmas, Theo. It’s the time of miracles.",
    "fullText": "“It’s Christmas, Theo. It’s the time of miracles.”\n\nWhen last seen, our heroes were getting their butts handed to them on national television.\n\nThe Bucs were walking off the field after losing for the second time in five days against two teams that are closer to the No. 1 draft pick than to splitting up Super Bowl shares. For the first time in 13 months, Tampa Bay no longer had a grip on the NFC South lead, and disgust was popping up every time anger dared to fade.\n\nWhich is when, miracle of miracles, the Panthers choked harder than the Bucs.\n\nA door was opened, a path was revealed, and now the Bucs need only win two of the final three games to clinch another division title. Under the right circumstances, they might even pull it off with one win in those final three games.\n\nThe question is, how would you feel about that?\n\nWould a fifth consecutive division title supersede any torment along the way? Or are you so disillusioned by the failure to match early season expectations that you cannot bear the prospect of another quick playoff exit? Have five losses in six games convinced you to turn off the TV and contemplate the holidays without Mike Evans, Baker Mayfield and Lavonte David?\n\nIn the spirit of the holidays, we are forgoing all our usual snark and negativity, and taking a more joyful approach to Sunday’s Tampa Bay-Carolina game. We’ve come up with five reasons — an Advent calendar of sorts from Sunday to Christmas Eve — to reexamine your disillusionment.\n\nIf that doesn’t help, try the spiked eggnog.\n\nDo you know what’s worse than stumbling toward a division title?\n\nCompared to 2019, this season is a cakewalk. Also, 2018. And, pretty much, any season after Jon Gruden was fired. From 2008-19, the Bucs went 12 consecutive years without reaching the postseason. Which isn’t as bad as 1983-96, when they missed the playoffs in 14 consecutive seasons.\n\nNow, they are two victories away from six playoff appearances in a row. Of the 32 teams in the NFL, only the Bills can match that streak.\n\nWhat’s the song say about pouting?\n\nWe had this conversation a few weeks ago, but it’s almost impossible to overstate what Mike Evans means to this offense. And while the Bucs somehow blew their two-touchdown lead against the Falcons on “Thursday Night Football,” the return of Evans should have brightened even the darkest of souls.\n\nEvans forces defenses to rethink how they want to attack Tampa Bay’s offense, and that opens up a whole new set of possibilities for Mayfield and offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard.\n\nOr, here’s a simpler way of looking at it:\n\nThe Bucs averaged 244 passing yards a game in the first six weeks of the season. After Evans got hurt against Detroit, the passing numbers tumbled to 162 yards a game for the next seven weeks. And when Evans returned against Atlanta? Back up to 250 yards.\n\nMuch of the angst this season has to do with expectations. Nobody disputes that Tampa Bay took advantage of a weak division to win titles in 2022, ’23 and ’24 with eight, nine and 10 wins. But this season was supposed to be different. This was a roster that looked like it could play deep into January.\n\nAt least to people around here.\n\nElsewhere, the football-watching world wasn’t as sold on Tampa Bay.\n\nBack in August, the over/under for victories for the Bucs was 9 ½. Today, they are 7-7. If they win their final three games, they will have eclipsed the “over” for the third season in a row.\n\nShould the Bucs have more than seven wins right now? Absolutely. You can excuse a stumble against Atlanta or New Orleans, but not both teams. Still, it could be much, much worse.\n\nYou could be a Chiefs fan. Or a Commanders fan.\n\nDo you know what a playoff appearance means in 2025?\n\nThat Lavonte David gets to walk away from the game with his head held high.\n\nThe 35-year-old linebacker may not be the player he was some years ago, but he still has the same passion on the field. The same pride, devotion and hunger.\n\nIt would be a surprise if this isn’t the end of the line for David, so these next three regular-season games should not be so easily dismissed. And if the Bucs win the division, David would join Evans and Derrick Brooks with the most postseason games (11) in Tampa Bay history.\n\nHow can you be cynical about that?\n\nWith Seattle coming from behind to beat the Rams on Thursday night, the Seahawks are now in control of the NFC West.\n\nThat means — should the Bucs win the South — there’s a good chance they would play the Rams at Raymond James Stadium in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nHow cool would it be to exact some revenge for the heartbreaking playoff loss against the Rams in 2021 at RayJay? Not to mention the 34-7 embarrassment in Los Angeles just last month. What a story it would be if the Bucs could upset the team a lot of fans expect to win the Super Bowl.\n\nLet’s stick with one miracle at a time.\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "description": "Denzel Perryman, Derwin James Jr. and Tony Jefferson reflect on how they are preparing their younger Chargers teammates for the looming playoff challenge ahead.",
    "fullText": "Denzel Perryman quickly listed name after name as he dove deep into his mental roster of the 2015 Chargers.\n\nManti Teʻo, Melvin Ingram, Kavell Conner and Donald Butler took Perryman under their wing, the Chargers linebacker said. The 11-year veteran said he relied on older teammates when he entered the NFL as they helped him adjust to the schedule and regimen of professional football.\n\n“When I was a young guy,” Perryman said, “my head was all over the place — just trying to get the gist of the NFL. They taught me how to be where my mind is.”\n\nWith the Chargers (10-4) entering the final stretch of the season and on the cusp of clinching a playoff berth heading into Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1), veterans have played an important role in the team winning six of its last seven games.\n\nA win over the Cowboys coupled with either a loss or tie by the Houston Texans on Sunday afternoon or an Indianapolis Colts loss or tie on Monday night would secure a playoff berth for the Chargers.\n\nPerryman, who recorded a season-best nine tackles in the Chargers' win over the Kansas City Chiefs last week, credits Philip Rivers and the rest of the Chargers' veterans for showing him \"how to be a pro\" a decade ago. Now he's passing along those lessons to younger players in a transfer of generational knowledge across the Chargers' locker room.\n\n“When I came in as a young guy, I thought this happens every year,” safety Derwin James Jr. said of winning, starting his career on a 12-4 Chargers team in 2018. “Remember the standard. Remember, whatever we're doing now, to uphold the standard, so that way, when guys change, coaches change, anything changes, the standard remains.”\n\nRunning off the field at Arrowhead Stadium, third-year safety Daiyan Henley charged at a celebrating Tony Jefferson, a veteran mentor at his position who was waiting for teammates after being ejected for an illegal hit on Chiefs wide receiver Tyquan Thornton.\n\nAfter the game Jefferson and Henley hopped around like schoolchildren on the playground. That’s the atmosphere the veterans want to create, Jefferson said, one in which younger players in the secondary can turn to him.\n\n“That's what we're here for,” Jefferson said. “For them to watch us and follow, follow our lead, and see how we do our thing.”\n\nIt's not just the veteran stars that are making a difference. Marcus Williams, a 29-year-old safety with 109 games of NFL experience, replaced Jefferson against the Chiefs after being elevated from the practice squad. The 2017 second-round pick played almost every snap in Jefferson's place, collecting four tackles.\n\n\"That just starts with the culture coach [Jim] Harbaugh creates,” defensive coordinator Jesse Minter said. “It's really a 70-man roster.\"\n\nHarbaugh highlighted defensive lineman/fullback Scott Matlock’s blocking technique — a ba-boop, ba-boop, as Harbaugh put it and mimed with his arms — on designed runs as an example of a veteran bolstering an offensive line trying to overcome the absence of Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater.\n\nHarbaugh said his father, Jack, taught Matlock the ba-boop, ba-boop blocking technique during an August practice.\n\n\"He's severely underrated as an athlete,” quarterback Justin Herbert said of the 6-foot-4, 296-pound Matlock, who also catches passes in the flat as a fullback.\n\nWith three games left in the regular season, Jefferson said the focus is on replicating the postseason-like efforts they gave in consecutive wins over the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n“It was good that they were able to get a taste of that,” Jefferson said of his younger teammates playing against last season's Super Bowl teams, “because these games down the stretch are really what's to come in the playoffs.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Linda Martindale, a boys high school coach, mental fitness expert and mom to collegiate players, says college athletes have this special ingredient.",
    "fullText": "Linda Martindale wasn’t brave, at least she didn’t think she was after she had been hired as a varsity boys basketball coach.\n\n“Once the game started, I was fine,” says Martindale, now in her sixth season leading Lincoln-Sudbury (MA), “but walking into the gym and people thinking I'm the scorekeeper or whatever, I had to sort of overcome this feeling of, ‘Do I belong in the gym?’ ”\n\nShe made the three words her mantra, and she convinced herself she was brave. You need to be as an athlete, or a coach, in today’s world of youth sports.\n\n“I have fond memories of my athletic career, but I also know there was a lot of heartache and it was very difficult,” says Martindale, who played Division II basketball at Alaska-Anchorage and in the old Pac-10 at Arizona in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “But nowadays, it's totally different. Your whole career is splashed all over social media.”\n\nMartindale’s father devoted his life to coaching baseball and football, driving her and her three siblings to be punctual and polite. He was hard on them, she says, but led with love.\n\n“If I had a bad game, the people in the stands knew and my parents knew, and that was it,” Martindale tells USA TODAY Sports. “You'd come home and your parents would say, ‘How did the game go?' You could self-report that. Easy to deal with.\n\n“My oldest son would literally get DMs from strangers that say horrible things if he missed a free throw in the clutch. The landscape is very different. And it obviously trickles down to youth.”\n\nMartindale got certified as a mental fitness coach to help ease the pressure on her three sons and one daughter (all of them have played college sports) but also other young athletes.\n\nShe works with sports teams at Division I Holy Cross and D-III Curry College, as well as individual athletes. She says there’s a secret beyond the physical component to playing sports in college.\n\nWe offer 10 ways, through consultation with Martindale, for parents to help athletes get there.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nWhen Martindale walked into the gym feeling the male eyes on her, she felt she needed an inner coach.\n\nYour coach on the court or field will tell you what to do but, Martindale says, the one in your head will kick you in the butt to help get you where you need to go.\n\nJenny Levy, who has won four national titles as North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, believes so strongly in an inner coach she likes when her players form their own mantras.\n\n“Confidence looks good on you,” she heard her players say to each other in 2013, the year they broke through.\n\n“A lot of coaches will say, ‘This is our saying,’ ” Levy told Martindale on Martindale’s ‘Game Changers’ podcast. “And I think that’s fine – to each his own – but I actually let our team organically come up with their own little things. This is the team having a good time together.”\n\nThe inner voice tells you it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, only what you do.\n\nTo come up with your own mantra, Martindale says, ask yourself why you play a sport? Look for performance cues to grind that thought into you.\n\n“It's not fun to lose, but it's still really fun to compete and to play,” Martindale says. “OK, good, let's start with that. So at least you can say it's not fun to lose, but it's really fun to prepare for the game. We've now established that the majority of the time is fun. Now we can get through the parts that aren't fun.”\n\nWas that ‘fun’? How Coco Gauff’s tough US Open embodies what the word means\n\nKids respond to the truth. We don’t need to always sugarcoat it.\n\nInstead of saying, “It’s not so hard,” acknowledge that something is.\n\nMaybe you’re afraid that you might lose or you’re going to make a fool of yourself in front of everybody.\n\n“I'm happy that you can articulate a fear,” Martindale might tell an athlete. “Now, let's squash it. What are you really afraid of? Is it really embarrassing to lose, or is it embarrassing not to play at all?\n\n“It would be embarrassing if you threw yourself on the floor and screamed and cried in the middle of the game. But nobody thinks it's embarrassing that you sat on the bench, cheered on your team, and then fought another day to try to get some minutes.”\n\nA current role doesn’t mean an ultimate role. Martindale goes back to Tom Brady.\n\nHe was once buried deep on Michigan’s depth chart. But he focused on nailing reps he got in practice. He was at game speed when he found himself starting.\n\n“As parents, we say, ‘I don't think you should have to be the backup quarterback,' \" Martindale says. “ 'I think you should be the quarterback.’ This is not helping. What you need to do is crush being the backup. And then your time comes and you're ready instead of spending so much time worrying that you don't have the role that you want (and) you're not ready for it.”\n\nAnother of her podcast guests, Luke Avdalovic, a former walk-on basketball player at Northern Arizona University, told her: “I had a teammate named JoJo Anderson and he told me, ‘If you want to find a role into this team, find one thing that you’re really good at. Make sure you’re head and shoulders better than every single other person on the team. Then they can’t take you off the floor.’ ”\n\nAvdalovic became a top sharpshooter who rose to the NBA G-League.\n\nAvdalovic has shot so much over the years he feels he’s never really in a slump. Some days he shoots better than others, but that is just the law of averages.\n\n“You can't be a pitcher if you can't pitch poorly,” Martindale says. “You can't be a shooter if you can't miss. It's just not possible (to) be perfect. So what do you do when you're imperfect?”\n\nThe next time your son or daughter has a bad game, ask them, “Did you compete hard?”\n\nYou don’t want them to lose or fail but they need to know how to do both. As parents, and as coaches, our best support can come out of struggles.\n\nYou know the term if you’re a baseball fan. Suddenly, Steve Sax or Chuck Knoblauch can’t make a routine throw from second to first base, or Rick Ankiel can’t throw a strike.\n\n“Yips is not a real thing,” Martindale says.\n\nStruggles come alive, she says, when we say them out loud. Instead, if you’re a parent or a coach, tell your athlete: “I really believe in you. Just keep throwing, you'll get it back, you'll find a rhythm.”\n\nWhen kids feel deep-rooted support, they have more confidence in themselves.\n\nMartindale says today’s world for young athletes is like taking the SATs while your score is being put on a scoreboard.\n\nSometimes, it seems, we expect our kids to be good at everything. Martindale asks the ones with whom she works, “What class are you good at?”\n\nShe doesn’t necessarily mean classes in which they have an “A,” but the ones they enjoy most.\n\nSometimes it takes looking at things through a less critical lens. We have an “A” in science, but we enjoy the challenge of English Lit, in which we have a B-, which energizes us to try and bring up the grade.\n\nEugene Glisky, Martindale’s father, had his ashes buried on the field where he coached near Toronto. She suspects he changed the lives of many young men.\n\nBut she stops short of calling a team a family.\n\n“When a coach says to a parent, ‘I'm gonna treat your son or daughter like my own,' I want to say, ‘No, thank you. I don't need you to treat my son like he’s your own,’ ” Martindale says. “He has a great father. What I really want you to do is treat him like a player and a human being.\n\n“It's a team, which is amazing and I love my kid being part of a team. But it's not a family. Why? Because what happens when your family cuts you?”\n\nThere are times when we need to be Coach, and times when we need to be Mom or Dad. Martindale had to be Coach when Judson, her oldest who now plays basketball for Manchester Basketball Club in the United Kingdom, came out of a game when he was younger and looked at her like, “Why are you pulling me?\n\nHe threw his water bottle, and she turned and said: \"You can take your sneakers off. You're done.\"\n\nThe same coach, though, drove him home from a different game, criticizing him for what he didn’t do while failing to realize he was sick.\n\n\"So many examples of total failure by me,\" she says. \"What kind of mother would be talking to their kid about some offensive set when clearly they needed a mother?\"\n\nLevy, North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, does parent Zoom calls. Before the first one, she asked her players what they wanted her to tell them.\n\n“They said, ‘We don’t want to talk about the game at the tailgate after,’ ” Levy told Martindale. “ ‘We don’t want any parent to have this sad conversation after the wins because their kid didn’t play. We want the parents to sit together. We want them to be positive on the sideline.’ ”\n\nLevy says the players gave her a Letterman top 10 of parent no-no’s, which she shared on the Zoom.\n\n“I think they were pretty shocked,” says Levy, who coaches her daughter, Kate, on the team. “Our kids were like, ‘Last year was not OK. This is what we want and this is what we need this year.’\n\n“And then if we saw it, I had permission from our players to call the parent and say, ‘Hey, you’re at the tailgate and your behavior was below the line for our program.’\n\n“What if I acted like that as a parent? What if I did that in the middle of a tailgate?”\n\nLevy’s point: A kid could be completely happy but if the parent is unhappy with their role, then the kid’s unhappy. And if the parent isn’t feeling like their kid is getting a fair shake, or they’re being really negative toward coaches or teammates, the kid internalizes the feeling.\n\n“Your influence is not neutral, parents,” Levy says.\n\nDuring a clip Martindale shared of her speaking to athletes, she says, “There has to be wins in there. Otherwise, you can't go an entire season and be like, ‘If we don't win a game, this whole season is a waste.’ ”\n\nShe is not necessarily talking about checks in the “W” column as much as what we perceive as personal wins. Maybe you tell a teammate you loved the way he blocked a punt or moved into position on defense. If we don’t have wins, even within losses, you don’t learn how to win.\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nMartindale believes there are five pillars of mental fitness: 1. Staying in the moment; 2. Controlling the controllables; 3. Seeing mistakes as opportunities; 4. Not judging yourself (or others) too harshly and 5. Comparison (positively).\n\nShe says she was once a failure at all of them. Has she since learned a special ingredient we need to have to play college sports?\n\nMartindale thinks Angela Duckworth, director of the Penn-Wharton Behavior Change for Good Initiative, said it best.\n\n“It’s grit,” Martindale has said. “I'm obsessed with grit, because we know it's a single defining characteristic of successful people.\n\n“Can you get up after you get knocked down? The athletes who are successful at every level of college, I think, have this kind of dog mentality that is about grit. And of course, you have to be skilled and you have to be athletic but when we really look at who performs best when it counts, it's people who have failed. Over and over and over. And then now they succeed.”\n\nWe can’t beat our kids up over mistakes. Let them hear the voice in their head that gives them the grace to move forward from them.\n\nThen, as Martindale says: “Watch them fail and then watch what they do after they fail.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "BVB started strongly, controlling the game with plenty of possession and taking an early lead through Brandt (10). Shortly before half-time, however, their superiority waned and the visitors grew into the game. It was only a late goal from substitute Maximilian Beier (90+7) in added time that dispelled any remaining doubts and brought noticeable relief after two recent draws against Bodø/Glimt (2-2) and Freiburg (1-1). “I’m very happy that we won. At the end of the day, it was deserved. We only allowed Gladbach one dangerous chance and missed one or two really good chances ourselves,” said coach Niko Kovac.\n\nUnlike in the past three seasons, BVB are in a Champions League spot going into the winter break. 32 points after 15 games means an average of 2.13 points per game – the best since 2018/19. “Borussia Dortmund haven't reached for a few years. However, that doesn't mean we’re satisfied. It doesn't mean we can't do things better. But we have to put it into perspective,” commented Sebastian Kehl.\n\nAccording to the sporting director, the hard-fought victory against Mönchengladbach revealed where the team still has room for improvement: “We need to learn to close out games earlier. We need more composure, more conviction and more confidence in our own abilities. We need to grow in these areas.”\n\nNevertheless, Kehl attested to the team’s significant progress at the end of the year: “We have lost only one game in the Bundesliga this season, conceded fewer goals, worked on injury issues and taken the next step in the medical and fitness areas. These are developments that are part of the process. It’s not about harmony, but about finding a balance. We are on the right track.”\n\nAgainst the visitors from the Lower Rhine, who had been in good form recently, BVB kept a clean sheet for the eighth time this season – already more than in the entire previous season. Dortmund also equalled a club record: 12 consecutive home wins against one opponent had previously only been achieved against MSV Duisburg between 1977 and 1998.\n\nOne of the five newcomers in the starting line-up was Julian Brandt, who had missed the Freiburg game due to injury. The 29-year-old once again proved to be an invigorating element in attack and is currently Dortmund’s leading goalscorer. His technically demanding volley to make it 1-0 was his fourth goal in the last three home games. He had previously scored once against Hoffenheim (2-0) and twice against Bodø/Glimt. “It was important to win this game after so many draws. We’ve had many Christmases without a win, so this feels extremely good,” said Brandt.\n\nNiklas Süle set up the goal with a precise cross. After weeks out with injury, the defender made a solid return to the team and received special praise from the coach. “The fact that he set up the goal shows how much finesse he has in his foot. We know what qualities he has. I’m glad to have him.” Kehl praised the veteran’s performance: “He put in a good performance, especially considering what he’s been through in recent days and how critical the reporting about him has been. I respect how he handled it.”\n\nThe professionals don’t have much time to relax. On 2 January, they will head to their training camp in Marbella. In southern Spain, the team will prepare for their first competitive match of the new year on 9 January away to Eintracht Frankfurt. “The players are now looking forward to a few quiet days. However, there won’t be much time to rest. We will have to ramp up relatively quickly to be ready for an intense January,” said Kehl.",

    "fullText": "Girona FC returns to Montilivi this Sunday, December 21, at 2:00 PM to face one of the most challenging opponents in the EA Sports League 2025-26, Atlético de Madrid. The match comes at an intense moment in the season, with both teams determined to earn valuable points towards their respective football goals.\n\nGirona approaches this match after a very positive weekend, with a notable away victory against Real Sociedad (1-2), their first win of the season away from Montilivi. This triumph comes in a context where Girona has competed with determination in recent league matches, also achieving notable draws such as the 1-1 against Real Madrid and the 1-1 against Betis.\n\nMeanwhile, Atlético de Madrid arrives at Montilivi with a solid trajectory in the league despite some recent difficulties. In the previous matchday, the team led by Diego Simeone returned to winning ways with a 2-1 victory over Valencia, with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Koke, regaining confidence after some matchdays with irregular results. This triumph has boosted the team's confidence and helped them remain among the top teams in the LaLiga standings. The Madrid team has also competed internationally, achieving an important result for their European aspirations in the Champions League group stage by winning 2-3 away against PSV.\n\nAmong the most memorable matches is a thrilling 4-3 victory by Girona against Atlético played at Montilivi in January 2024, a duel with goal alternations and intensity, in which the Girona team delivered a memorable offensive performance. On the other hand, in the 2024-25 season, the home match ended with an adverse result (0-4) against Atlético on matchday 38 of the league, a game where the Madrid team showed great offensive effectiveness.\n\nAnother recent example was at the beginning of that same season, when Girona visited the Metropolitano and, despite competing, ended with a 3-0 defeat against the Madrid team.\n\nThe Girona fans will have a date with high-level football at home this Sunday, with the team's commitment to compete intensely from the first minute. As the season progresses and with every point at stake in LaLiga, this preview of the match against Atlético de Madrid sets up a clash that promises excitement, strategy, and dedication from both squads, with Montilivi as the stage for the showdown.",

Goalkeeper Nick Pope remains out, while Newcastle are light on defenders with Dan Burn joining Sven Botman, Kieran Trippier and Emil Krafth on the injury list. We can expect Tonali, Woltemade, Gordon and Elanga to start after they were on the bench for the League Cup win against Fulham.\n\nThe Blues are without Romeo Lavia, Estevao, Liam Delap and Dario Essugo through injury, while Maresca rotated heavily for the midweek League Cup win. Cole Palmer scored in the win against Everton last weekend and he will start as Chelsea's entire attacking unit clicks better when he's in the team.\n\nEddie Howe's Newcastle reached the League Cup semifinals in midweek by beating Fulham 2-1, but they lost 1-0 at bitter rivals Sunderland last weekend and are in the bottom half of the table. But such is the congested nature of the table, a few wins over the festive period will see Newcastle surge up towards the European spots. They certainly have the quality to do that but a ruthless edge has just been missing this season.\n\nChelsea also reached the League Cup semifinals in midweek by beating third-tier Cardiff City, but the scrutiny around their manager Enzo Maresca is the talking point right now. After their routine home win against Everton last weekend Maresca, totally unprompted, described the previous few days as the “worst 48 hours” of his time in charge of Chelsea. He said that was because he and his players weren't supported. But given multiple opportunities in the press he has not clarified who he is referring to but has said he is happy with the fans. That has opened up a can of worms off the pitch and on it Chelsea are eight points off the top of the table after a bad run of results to kick off December. They need a positive festive period to push themselves back into the title conversation.\n\nThis always seems like a tough match-up for Chelsea, but I'm going for them to get a big win. Newcastle 1-3 Chelsea.",

    "description": "Steve Hanke, a veteran economist, said he can't sleep at night thinking about inflation and high stock prices in the US.",
    "fullText": "What keeps the money doctor up at night?\n\nSteve Hanke, a veteran economist and applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, said there are two significant problems in the US economy and markets that are keeping him from getting a good night's sleep.\n\nOne is inflation, which he thinks could start to spiral out of the Fed's control.\n\nThe other is high stock prices, which will start crashing back to earth, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"What is keeping me up at night is the idea that the Fed is going to be unable to hit its inflation target in 2026,\" the veteran economist and commodities trader wrote.\n\n\"As far as the stock market is concerned, my Dr. X's Bubble Detector is sitting at an all-time high, indicating that we are in a bubble,\" he added of equity prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, there are a few signs that price growth in the US is starting to heat up again. Headline inflation was cooler than expected in November, but still considerably above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nHanke, who has described himself as a \"money doctor\" and has long held the view that the money supply is a key driver of inflation, also pointed to the recent growth in the M2 money supply. That's a measure of the amount of cash flowing around the economy, and it has climbed by $3.5 trillion over the past five years, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\n\"For me, that is the most important metric,\" Hanke said of the inflation outlook. \"It looks like the money supply is going to be goosed, if not over-goosed.\"\n\nThere are a few developments that look like they can stoke inflation leading into the next year, Hanke said:\n\n\"My concern is that, after letting the money supply explode in 2020-21 and imposing inflation on Americans, the Fed has failed to put the inflation Genie back in the bottle,\" Hanke said.\n\nThe outlook for the stock market doesn't look much better, in Hanke's view. He pointed to bloated valuations in the tech sector as the mania for artificial intelligence reaches new heights.\n\n\"As far as the warning signs concerning the course of an AI bubble, you will never know when you will realize a Wile E. Coyote moment,\" he said, later adding that he advised investors to rebalance their portfolios.\n\nHanke, known for his persistently bearish forecasts for markets and the economy, has long forewarned of trouble heading for the US. In October, he speculated that AI companies today could eventually see a dot-com-style fate once they started missing their growth forecasts.\n\nLast year, he also doubled down on his call that the US economy was headed for a recession, but told Business Insider he had recently started leaning away from that stance on account of hotter inflation.",

    "description": "Mark Penn is a former Microsoft exec and was the White House pollster to Bill Clinton. He's now the CEO of marketing company Stagwell.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mark Penn, the 71-year-old CEO and Chairman of Stagwell, based in Miami Beach. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy career spans 40 years in market research, advertising, public relations, polling, and consulting.\n\nBefore founding Stagwell, a global marketing and communications company, I served as an executive vice president and chief strategy officer at Microsoft.\n\nI'm also the cofounder and CEO of Penn Schoen Berland, a market research firm that I built and sold to WPP, a British multinational communications company.\n\nFor six years, I served as the White House pollster to President Bill Clinton and was the chief strategist for his 1996 reelection campaign. I later served as chief strategist to Hillary Clinton throughout her Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential bid.\n\nAt WPP, I saw the ins and outs of big marketing and decided it wasn't people-oriented enough. I decided to establish a new company to address the problems I observed.\n\nI was still at Microsoft, and I had been promoted to head all the advertising. The chief strategy officer, Steve Ballmer, came to me and said, \"You know, that idea you've had? I like that idea, and I'll be your core investor.\"\n\nOn September 15, 2015, we started Stagwell with a single employee in a half-rented office.\n\nHere's what a typical day looks like 10 years later with a team of 13,000 employees worldwide.\n\nSeveral people on my team are up for 4 a.m., but not me. I sleep until at least 7 or 7:30 a.m.\n\nI'm, unfortunately, the type of person who picks up my phone as soon as I wake up. I don't spend the whole day on the phone, but I do like to check in periodically to see what's going on.\n\nI'm on the phone between 7 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. I'm watching a bit of TV to catch up on the news and shoot out a couple of emails.\n\nI don't drink coffee, I skip breakfast, and I don't have a morning exercise routine. I have a core lounging period, then I shower at 8:30 a.m. and get dressed.\n\nMy goal is to be in the office exactly at 9 a.m., five days a week.\n\nI go into the office depending on which city I'm in, as I visit our offices in Miami Beach, Washington, D.C., and New York. I only work remotely if I get a little behind during the day.\n\nWhen I arrive at the office, I have a lot of meetings, but sometimes I also have interviews and TV appearances.\n\nI've organized the business by corporate leadership and its divisions. I want everyone to have a clear understanding of what's happening in the company. I like my team to know and work with each other, even if they're no longer in the same place.\n\nComing out of Microsoft, I saw how Steve Ballmer had a huge team under him, but he would always manage to leave at 5:30 p.m. The answer was that he planned out his time well.\n\nMy chief of staff manages my schedule and who has access to it, and then there are one or two other administrative staff behind them — they sort things out once or twice a week.\n\nGenerally, I order a Postmates lunch. I'm a big fan of steamed Chinese food, so I typically order steamed dishes with vegetables and hot-and-sour soup, and sometimes a sushi and sashimi combo.\n\nI prefer not to eat during meetings; it's essential to remain focused on the people I'm meeting with. I squeeze in lunch between meetings.\n\nAround 12:30 p.m., I schedule a half-hour catch-up, which could be spent with HR, marketing, a client meeting, or an ad hoc meeting for something that has come up.\n\nThere's no breathing room, pretty much from 12:30 p.m. to 5 p.m., with lots of meetings. There are many PowerPoint presentations.\n\nI used to do presidential races, so that was constant, 'Oh my god, the candidate did what?' situations. We don't get as much derailment at Stagwell.\n\nSometimes things run long, sometimes things break down in some way, but it's pretty unusual.\n\nI wish I knew the secret to maintaining high energy consistently. I drink sugar-free Snapple and Diet Coke; I don't drink much coffee or caffeine. I have a naturally evenly balanced level of energy.\n\nThe days on the road are more interesting than the days in the office, whether that means visiting an office, holding a town hall, meeting a combination of clients, or attending a board meeting.\n\nMy day is structured around meetings with relevant stakeholders, where I present either their current progress or their proposed plans, and gather feedback on their accomplishments and approval for their future initiatives.\n\nAll other stakeholders are always present, so that if they want to comment, they have the opportunity to do so immediately, and also so that everyone is informed about what's going on.\n\nWhen people are siloed too much and don't understand each other, they'll never be able to collaborate or build a great culture.\n\nWhen I get home from the office, I usually have dinner with my wife. We have four kids, but they're all older now. For dinner, I like a lot of protein, a vegetable, and a baked potato.\n\nAfter dinner, I might catch up on the news. My wife tends to go to sleep a little earlier than I do, around 10 p.m., and I might spend some time catching up on the news, Netflix, or other things.\n\nI read a lot of news and information, but I also enjoy watching science fiction shows. I can get hooked on a series and stay up to 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. — that can be disastrous.\n\nThe last series I got hooked on was Lioness on Prime Video. I'm watching the final episode of Foundation on Apple TV, which has been the most interesting show of the season.\n\nBefore I go to bed, I'll make sure I'm pretty covered on the news.\n\nI like playing Neural Bridge when I'm having trouble falling asleep.\n\nI avoid working on weekends unless there's an emergency or crisis. I respect my employees' time. Occasionally, there's some Sunday night work, but my goal is to ensure every position is filled with someone who's really effective at what they do, let them do their job, and have them report. I don't believe in micromanaging people.\n\nI encourage my team to shoot for the stars, and in a sense, they come back with a big, ambitious plan. I'd rather you reach 90% of an ambitious plan than 100% of an unambitious one.",

    "title": "I worked at Tesla and Waymo. Here are the leadership lessons I bring to my startup.",
    "description": "Spencer Penn worked at Tesla and Waymo before he founded LightSource, an AI-powered sourcing and procurement startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Spencer Penn, the 33-year-old founder of LightSource, who lives in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to California 10 years ago, back when Tesla was a boutique car business. We were making 1,000 vehicles a week.\n\nMy friends and family were telling me it was a big career mistake to work at Tesla. They said it would never be someone's main car, that it's a tech toy, that it's an iPad with wheels on it. But I was just excited to see what this Elon guy was up to.\n\nMy interactions with Elon were always very positive, but I'm not a fanboy. There were some things that were very notable about his leadership style.\n\nTesla is a very flat organization. When I was there, even relatively young and out of college, it was two levels between Elon and me. That's very unusual to have such close proximity so early in your career.\n\nJust because it's a flat org structure, doesn't mean it's a horizontal power dynamic. Elon is the king. What he says goes. If you wanted to get something done, you really did have to go through Elon.\n\nThe drawbacks were that the guy didn't have that much time. In 2017, he was running three different companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink. He was just getting started with OpenAI. He had two and a half days a week to really focus on Tesla exclusively. You'd have to get things approved in that period of time.\n\nBut he was also very focused on the product. He would get involved in the way that things felt. If you wanted to change a texture on a paint, you'd want to get his buy-in.\n\nMany CEOs go the opposite direction. They let themselves get so far removed from the product. Elon always felt the product was the thing, and the innovation would be what drives the company forward.\n\nI like to embody that here at our company. I still do demos. If you take your hands off the wheel, things might veer in a direction you don't like.\n\nElon has a knack for setting overly ambitious goals. There are benefits and drawbacks. Sometimes, you lose credibility. Certain products like the new Roadster were unveiled back when I was an employee, and they've yet to be delivered.\n\nBut there are certain things where you shoot for the moon and you do hit the stars. Nobody thought Starlink would be as successful as quickly as it has been.\n\nIf you apply the right amount of pressure, you can see where the leaks are. That kind of ambition is everything.\n\nThat's the final thing Elon does: he's really a risk taker. He's bet the company multiple times; he always keeps putting the chips back on red. I think about that a lot. Sometimes it can be hard for professional management to take the risks they need to. Sometimes you can sleepwalk into a long-term, uncompetitive position.\n\nThere was some internal signaling. People knew that Elon was in the factory. They knew that he was going to stay there until the issues were fixed. Elon works about as hard as any human on earth possibly can.\n\nThere's a hotel right across the street from the Fremont factory. Part of me always felt like, instead of setting up pillows in a conference room, I would like our CEO to be well-rested and go to the hotel five minutes away. But the signaling was very potent.\n\nI try to embody that to some degree here, too. I like to come into the office five days a week. I want people to know that I'm coming in early and I'm staying late. I unload the dishwasher in the office. I'm assembling IKEA furniture.\n\nWaymo was a very different organization. It's a very vertical org structure. Google is a large organization with lots of levels, and that translated directly to Waymo, which is a much smaller business.\n\nEven though it's a very vertical org structure, it's a horizontal power structure. It's like it's rotated 90 degrees from Tesla.\n\nSome people compared the org to slime mold. It starts to spread and find all the crevices on its own. Individual contributors could construct their own ideas.\n\nThere are benefits and drawbacks. There is the possibility that there are duplicative teams doing the same things in different ways. But it also leads to a lot of creativity.\n\nAt Tesla, it was very clear that Elon and his lieutenants were driving a lot of the decisions. The decisions that the more junior people made would be incremental. At Google, I found that a lot of the best ideas come from the individual folks in the business, because they're given the freedom to roam.\n\nIn a startup, you have limited resources. You have to be focused, but a lot of the best ideas come from experimentation.\n\nWe had an engineer who asked if he could move his start date by a month. He was like, \"I want to spend a month before I get into work catching up on everything that's happening in AI.\" He came to the table, and he had so deeply immersed himself that he had a lot of new and fresh ideas. Many of those ideas have become product features.\n\nI have to delegate innovation to folks on the team to find those opportunities. That's something I learned from Google.",

    "title": "A CIO managing $20 billion says one of the best opportunities for investors right now is in a corner of the bond market",
    "description": "This long-term bond could be one of the best places for your money, according to an investment chief at a $20 billion fund.",
    "fullText": "You don't often hear about the 30-year Treasury bond as a top investment opportunity, but one CIO wants you to look again.\n\nInvestors typically keep their eyes on a couple of key interest rates: the 10-year Treasury yield, since is heavily influences things like mortgage rates and is a proxy for longer-term inflation expectations; and the ultra-short-term fed funds rate, which is what the Federal Reserve adjusts to stimulate or slow down the economy.\n\nYet, the 30-year Treasury is one of the most attractive investment opportunities in markets right now, according to Elliott Dornbusch, the chief investment officer at CV Advisors, which manages $20 billion in assets.\n\nYields on the 30-year are a robust 4.8%, considerably higher than the 10-year's 4.14%. That's because investors tend to demand more compensation for the extra duration risk they take on.\n\nFor many, the 30-year's uber-long duration is one of its most undesirable qualities. If yields rise and the note's value falls, you don't want to be stuck holding it for three decades. But Dornbusch is banking on being able to sell the asset for a profit a lot sooner than that.\n\nHe said he expects yields to fall—which means bond prices will rise—from current levels for a couple of reasons. First, he thinks investors are overstating long-term inflation risk, thanks in part to tariffs. While import taxes lead to higher goods prices, they also cut into demand for services, which balances out the overall inflation equation, he said. It's also, theoretically at least, a one-time price movement.\n\n\"If you think long term, tariffs are deflationary because they're taking money away from people's pockets,\" Dornbusch said, adding: \"People might not go to Disney, for example.\"\n\nSecond, if stocks suffer a bear market at some point, investors will likely seek safety in long-term Treasurys. That heightened demand for the risk-free assets will push their value up and their yields down, allowing those who bought in at current prices to sell them for a profit. In this sense, it also acts as a portfolio hedge.\n\n\"You could get a return on the 30-year Treasury for the next 4 years that kind of resembles like a 10% return — both on coupon and on appreciation, if you have the patience,\" he said. \"It also serves as a great hedge for my long equity position.\"\n\nDornbusch's view runs counter to the views of other bond-market strategists. Consensus today seems to prefer the so-called \"belly\" of the yield curve — mid-duration assets in the two-to-five year range. With short-term rates on a downward path, this approach allows investors to lock in yields at around 3.5% for the next few years while not having to sweat too much about duration risk if yields end up rising on an inflation scare.\n\nBut as Dornbusch sees it, if long-term yields are going to come down, you might as well clip a coupon that's almost 5% in the meantime.\n\n\"I'm very contrarian and I really like the thirty-year Treasury bond today,\" he said. \"I think that this idea of inflation in the economy, people will realize the reality of how inflation works and the 30-year treasury yielding almost 5% is extremely attractive.\"",

    "title": "Palm Beach is buzzing with Wall Street energy this winter. Here's our insider guide to the hotspots.",
    "description": "Wall Street arrived in Palm Beach early this winter. From Milos to Mary Lou's, these restaurants and nightlife spots are leading the scene.",
    "fullText": "Ask me about the ZIP code 33480, and I'll have plenty to say.\n\nIt's Palm Beach, a place I know well. I grew up in South Florida, and even now, I spend a good amount of time here, watching how the island continues to evolve. It also happens to overlap with my job: as a Wall Street reporter, many of the firms we cover — from Goldman Sachs to Citadel — have built out significant \"Wall Street South\" operations in and around Palm Beach County over the past few years.\n\nThis winter, locals tell me the island feels especially busy — noticeably earlier than usual. Restaurants are filling up weeks ahead of the holidays, reservations are disappearing quickly, and the finance crowd is playing a noticeable role, restaurant insiders say.\n\n\"We've never seen the island this full this early in the season,\" Alex Melillo, a partner at Mary Lou's, one of West Palm's newest and hottest nightlife venues, told me.\n\nTo get a broader sense of where people are actually going, I asked around. In addition to speaking with restaurant operators and longtime denizens of \"the Island,\" I checked in with some local contacts in finance: a money manager who works for a large bank and a trusted friend who works in private asset management.\n\nIn my conversations, the same names kept coming up — places where Wall Streeters, finance professionals, and winter visitors congregate when they're here.\n\nI recently had a meal at Buccan and wasn't disappointed. Unlike many popular Palm Beach hot spots that lean old-world, the space feels particularly modern, matching the restaurant's more cosmopolitan approach to dining.\n\nThe menu is built around avant-garde plates meant for sharing, with dishes that change seasonally but often include standouts like hamachi tiradito, inventive crudos, and rich pastas.\n\nWhen I went with a friend, we split the sweet corn agnolotti — and it's an absolute must. The room draws a lively mix of locals and visiting professionals, and it's the kind of place where dinners tend to stretch. Next door is Imoto, Buccan's sister restaurant, a sleek sushi spot if you're craving Japanese.\n\nCucina is often the first stop when my friends and I are looking for a fun night out.\n\nIt's Palm Beach's playground, an island favorite for seeing and being seen — and a place that tends to extend a simple dinner into a much longer affair when the music comes on. Specialized lights illuminate the ceiling in keeping with the DJ's beat. Tables feel like prime real estate, and the room gets even more packed as the evening goes on.\n\nOn busy nights, it's clear this is where a large cross-section of Palm Beach society — including professionals from out of town — has descended. The door can be selective, but once you're inside, the expectation is that you'll stay awhile and dance. I recommend stopping by Lola 41 around the corner for a drink first.\n\nEstiatorio Milos opened earlier this year on the West Palm Beach waterfront, bringing one of the most respected names in Mediterranean seafood to South Florida. The restaurant has the same bright, luminous aesthetic found at other Milos locations — including Hudson Yards — with fresh fish displayed on ice and a glowing bar that makes an ideal backdrop for conversation on a buzzy night.\n\nAside from Avra in Sunny Isles, this may be the best Greek restaurant in South Florida right now. A must-order for the table is the Milos chips — paper-thin zucchini and eggplant, lightly fried and genuinely impossible to resist — alongside simply prepared whole fish grilled with lemon and olive oil.\n\nIf you're craving a taste of Manhattan — or Paris — in Palm Beach, La Goulue has become one of the island's most popular destinations. The South Florida offshoot of the classic Upper East Side French restaurant serves familiar staples like cheese soufflé, lobster bisque, and rich French onion soup, drawing a steady mix of locals and winter visitors.\n\nIt's rarely quiet. \"I was passing by La Goulue the other day, and there wasn't an empty seat,\" said Daphne Nikolopoulos, editor in chief of Palm Beach Illustrated, a popular glossy title in the area. The restaurant has become a dependable choice for everything from long family dinners to client meals — the kind of place finance and business guests return to repeatedly once they're settled in town for the season.\n\nAn Upper East Side mainstay that opened in Palm Beach in 2021, Le Bilboquet has become a dependable stop for winter visitors looking for a taste of home. The French bistro serves its signature dishes — including cajun chicken, tuna tartare, and Dover sole — in a setting that works just as well for long lunches as for leisurely dinners.\n\nThe restaurant has been especially busy this season. \"We're certainly seeing a strong presence from the finance and business community this winter,\" a spokesperson for the restaurant told me. They said they've also seen an increase in group meals and celebrations, \"including more corporate and business dinners, often with groups of eight to 10 guests,\" tied to end-of-year and holiday gatherings.\n\nIf you're interested in a memorable night out, Mary Lou's, which opened this year to much fanfare, is arguably the area's hottest ticket. Inside, you'll find a space that's dark and sultry, anchored by a dramatic chandelier over the bar and a massive disco ball overhead. Visiting celebrities often pass through, tucked into the discrete banquettes along the wall.\n\nMelillo, one of Mary Lou's three partners, said the season has ramped up earlier than usual, driven in large part by visiting finance and corporate guests who are spending longer stretches in Palm Beach and going out more frequently. For Wall Streeters and the local professional crowd, the environment feels inviting but still upscale. Expect to see well-dressed partiers in sport jackets and toasting with free-flowing libations.\n\nJoe Cervasio, the partner who oversees programming, said the venue has leaned into booking touring DJs and festival-level talent as demand has grown.\n\n\"I cannot hold enough champagne — it's literally falling through our fingertips,\" Melillo said.\n\nReservations are strongly recommended.\n\nOne of the most talked-about openings on Palm Beach Island this season is The Polo Room, the new restaurant led by internationally known polo player Nacho Figueras. The menu is inspired by the legendary polo star's Argentinian roots.\n\nNot to be mistaken for an offshoot of a separate restaurant — Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar on 55th Street in Midtown — the space opened in early December and has quickly drawn attention from locals and winter visitors. It features an equestrian aesthetic throughout.\n\n\"Without question, The Polo Room is fantastic,\" said Nikolopoulos, who was one of the new restaurant's first customers. \"Figueras doesn't do anything halfway — he's meticulous and very professional with all his endeavors.\"\n\nShe said the food stood out, pointing to the empanadas and steaks in particular, and noted that Figueras has incorporated family recipes into the menu — like his mom's signature chocolate mousse for dessert.",

    "title": "Corporate types are clamoring for a new kind of plastic surgery using dead people's fat",
    "description": "Corporate types are waiting weeks for — and spending big on — alloClae, which cuts out the recovery time typically associated with body enhancements.",
    "fullText": "In his plush Upper East Side office earlier this year, Dr. Sachin Shridharani was at work on a patient's breasts: applying a local anesthesia, making an incision, ensuring the final result sat just right.\n\nThrough it all, his patient — an executive — had her AirPods in. She was on a conference call with a client, Shridharani told Business Insider. Less than two hours after she walked in, she popped up, checked out her new physique, and dashed off to her office.\n\nAs recently as a year ago, a typical boob job would have involved general anesthesia and a multiday recovery.\n\nBut Shridharani was using alloClae, a new product from manufacturer Tiger Aesthetics that's becoming increasingly popular with patients eager to look their best in the boardroom without undergoing general anesthesia or taking days off for recovery.\n\nRather than relying on an implant or a patient's own body fat to add volume to hips or augment breasts, alloClae — which can cost as much as $100,000 per procedure — uses donor fat from a cadaver as a first-of-its-kind body filler.\n\n\"People are paying for the convenience,\" Shridharani, who has done more than 50 procedures with alloClae and was part of its trial, said. \"It's about not having the downtime, not needing more aggressive procedures, not having an anesthetic.\"\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to a half dozen plastic surgeons, largely based in New York and California, who, together, have completed around 75 procedures with alloClae since it became available earlier this year. They described wealthy executives and corporate types clamoring for the product, booking 6 a.m. visits so they could make it to work by 7, and using the filler to look better in their suits — work, not swim, that is. Demand for alloClae has outpaced supply, resulting in a shortage and backlog of appointments.\n\nWhile many of their alloClae patients are high-ranking professionals looking for a quick zhuzh, there are several other reasons people opt for the product. Some lack sufficient body fat for a typical transfer collected through liposuction. Others don't want the loose skin that can be associated with lipo. Some simply don't want to deal with anesthesia.\n\nTake Gretchen Seal, the 57-year-old CFO at global telecommunications company Convo Relay, who got alloClae in September to smooth out the edge of a breast implant and used extra product to fill out hip dips. The numbing took longer than the procedure itself, which clocked in under 40 minutes, she said.\n\n\"I got in my car, and I drove straight home from the procedure, and I went to work,\" Seal said.\n\nEven with the hip enhancement, she spent the afternoon sitting comfortably at her desk.\n\nThe rise in GLP-1s has contributed to the alloClae fervor. It's not only Ozempic face — it's deflated Ozempic boobs, hips, butt.\n\nShridharani has male patients who have lost weight on the likes of Ozempic, only to find they don't quite fill out their suits the way they used to.\n\n\"In their own words, 'I've got no ass,'\" he said. \"'My trousers look like they're falling off.'\"\n\nIn a workforce that prioritizes appearances — studies have shown more attractive people get paid more — alloClae is becoming the C-suite's secret weapon.\n\nalloClae is part of a larger boom in less-invasive cosmetic procedures.\n\nThe annual number of minimally invasive procedures, from Botox to lip fillers, is growing faster than surgical cosmetic procedures, reaching over 28 million last year, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\n\"It was all about the lunchtime Botox procedure,\" Caroline Van Hove, the president of Tiger Aesthetics, said. \"That is still the appeal of medically aesthetic products that are minimally invasive, meaning you have little downtime.\"\n\nTiger Aesthetics, which also provides implants and traditional fillers, began offering alloClae to a select group of doctors in the fall of 2024, followed by a soft rollout to a few hundred surgeons this past spring, and a full launch that's planned early next year, Van Hove said. The company didn't disclose how many patients have used the product.\n\nWhile alloClae comes from a cadaver, the product is less macabre than you may think, and even patients who may be turned off by the whole dead body thing typically come around to it, Dr. Bob Basu, the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said.\n\nWhen individuals donate their bodies for science, such as organ donations, tissue banks often collect abdominal fat cells. Tiger Aesthetics purchases that fat, screens it for diseases, purifies it, and processes it. By the end, it looks like clumpy butter in a syringe.\n\nThe process means Tiger Aesthetics is \"at the mercy of donated tissue,\" Van Hove said. The company aims to increase its intake of donor fat as it expands its manufacturing facilities and is exploring ways to improve tissue yields, she said.\n\n\"As of the beginning of 2026, we'll be producing a ton more alloClae so that we can service the real demand that's out there,\" Van Hove said.\n\nalloClae is regulated by the FDA. Van Hove said the approval process differs from that of implants or medications like Botox, as it's sold under a different designation.\n\nWhile other products that use donor fat exist, alloClae is unique in its composition and the volume in which it is administered. Most patients use between 50 and 100 CCs, Van Hove said, though doctors that Business Insider spoke with have used as much as 550 CCs on a patient. By comparison, Renuva, a donor fat product made by MTF Biologics, is typically dispensed in much smaller quantities and used on the face. (alloClae is not recommended for the face.)\n\nalloClae's convenience comes at a cost, depending on how much donor fat you want.\n\nDoctors said the procedures, including the doctor's fees and the price of the alloClae itself, can cost a customer between $10,000 and $100,000. If a patient gets 100 or 200 CCs — enough for a slight contour of the hip or filling out of the breast — the cost is pretty much in line with the cost of a typical fat transfer, Shridharani said. More than that, the steep cost of alloClae quickly adds up.\n\nWhere a typical breast augmentation with an implant at an upscale office like Shridharani's would start at $15,000, a minor breast adjustment using alloClae starts at $12,000 and could exceed $30,000 depending on the desired volume.\n\n\"The thing that shocks me a little bit is just how expensive the product is, but still the willingness of patients to pay for it,\" said San Francisco-based plastic surgeon Dr. David Sieber, who hasn't yet injected alloClae but has patients waiting for the product.\n\nThat willingness comes even without long-term, proven results.\n\nSo far, the doctors who spoke with Business Insider have said the initial results are promising, but as Basu said, there's been no three- or five-year follow-up yet.\n\nThe procedures he has done with alloClae are all \"subtle refinements,\" he said. \"It is not go big or go home.\"\n\nDouglas Steinbrech, who has medical practices for men in New York City, Beverly Hills, and Chicago, has a term he uses at the office: \"C-level surgery.\" C as in C-suite — and among that crowd, alloClae has been graded A+.\n\n\"The CEOs, COOs, CCOs that don't want to be away from the boardroom,\" Steinbrech told Business Insider. He has primarily had men get alloClae put in their shoulders and chests.\n\n\"They have to go to a lot of meetings that just pop up, and they cannot control when they're going to happen. They can't just clear their schedule to recover for a surgery,\" he added.\n\nOften, patients return to the office the same day as their procedure, or get the injection in the afternoon and go back the next morning.\n\nFor Seal, the CFO, liposuction was never a viable option because she doesn't have enough fat to transfer. When she learned that a breast lift surgery to fix her implant would necessitate weeks without getting on a plane to avoid blood clots, she knew it would never work with her job.\n\n\"My schedule changes so much,\" she said. \"I hop on planes to Silicon Valley, I go to New York, Washington.\"\n\nThat's when her plastic surgeon suggested alloClae. If she could bear the monthlong wait, she could get 100 CCs of the product — and none of the downtime.\n\n\"It worked beautifully,\" she said. \"I feel much more confident.\"\n\nDoctors say patients now come in asking for it by name — though it can be hard to find. Van Hove said the product is sold out until the end of January.\n\nBut good things come to those who wait. Dr. Adam Schaffner, who has had dozens of patients express interest in alloClae, was celebrating on the day he spoke to Business Insider — 400 CCs of the product had just been delivered to his New York City office.",

Ron DeSantis of Florida — a 2024 GOP primary opponent of Trump's — has been a consistent critic of federal efforts to curtail states' ability to regulate AI.\n\nAs lawmakers considered adding an AI regulation moratorium to the annual defense bill in November, DeSantis wrote on X that doing so is a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"\n\n\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment,\" DeSantis wrote. \"Denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's executive order, DeSantis said at an AI roundtable event in Florida that he was confident that it wouldn't apply to laws that the governor is pursuing in his state.\n\nBut he said that if the administration did try to challenge Florida laws, he would expect the state to prevail.\n\n\"Even reading it very broadly, I think the stuff we're doing is going to be very consistent,\" DeSantis said of the executive order. \"But irrespective, clearly we have a right to do this.\"\n\nAs Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene began to break with the president over the summer, one of the issues the Georgia Republican highlighted was AI.\n\nGreene notably admitted to voting for an initial version of the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" without realizing that it contained a provision to block state AI regulation for AI.\n\n\"I am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there,\" Greene wrote on X in June.\n\nFull transparency, I did not know about this section on pages 278-279 of the OBBB that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years.\n\nI am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in… pic.twitter.com/bip3hztSGq\n\nThe Georgia Republican re-upped her criticism when the provision was under consideration for the annual defense bill in November.\n\n\"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state,\" Greene wrote on X. \"Federalism must be preserved.\"\n\nJust days later, Greene announced that she would resign from Congress on January 5 after Trump called her a \"traitor,\" largely over her stance on the Epstein files.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley has been one of the biggest GOP critics of the AI industry in the Senate — and he's opposed efforts to restrict states from regulating the technology.\n\n\"I would think that, just as a matter of federalism, we'd want states to be able to try out different regimes that they think will work for their state,\" Hawley told Business Insider in June. \"And I think in general, on AI, I do think we need some sensible oversight that will protect people's liberties.\"\n\nWhen the AI provision was reported to be no longer under consideration for the defense bill in November, Hawley celebrated via a post on X.\n\n\"Good. This is a terrible provision and should remain OUT,\" he wrote.\n\nIn June, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas — who served as the White House Press Secretary during Trump's first term — led a group of 17 Republican governors in opposing an AI moratorium in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThat provision in that bill was stronger than Trump's executive order — it would have amounted to a more wholesale ban on state-level AI regulation for a period of 10 years.\n\nSanders also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post opposing the plan.\n\n\"That Congress proposes to strip away the right of any state to regulate AI is the antithesis of what our founders envisioned when they established our federal system,\" she wrote in June.\n\nIn November, as lawmakers considered adding a similar provision to the defense bill, Sanders spoke up again.\n\n\"Now isn't the time to backtrack,\" she wrote on X. \"Drop the preemption plan now and protect our kids and communities.\"\n\nGov. Spencer Cox of Utah, among the GOP governors who signed onto Sanders' letter, has also remained outspoken against efforts to limit state-level AI regulation.\n\n\"I'm very worried about any type of federal incursion into states' abilities to regulate AI,\" Cox told NPR in November.\n\nIn December, as Trump prepared to sign his executive order, Cox said there was a need for more balance.\n\n\"An alternative AI executive order focused on human flourishing would strike the balance we need: safeguard our kids, preserve our values, and strengthen American competitiveness,\" Cox wrote on X. \"States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI.\"",

    "description": "Baz Costello, 48, plans to start his own company after struggling to find a tech job. He said one employer said he was \"too senior.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Baz Costello, 48, who lives in Brighton and Hove, UK. He recently decided to start his own company after growing frustrated with his job search. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI was a consultant for a big digital consultancy up until November last year. I worked there as both a product lead and was also the chair of the neurodiversity employee resource group.\n\nAt the start of this year, I went back to contracting, and then I learned I had prostate cancer. It was stage one, and I was on active monitoring for six months. I did some more contracting up until July, when I was told I needed to have treatment. So, I had treatment, and all the signs were good. In August, I thought, \"OK, I can start looking to go back to work.\"\n\nI spoke to some recruitment agencies and public-sector IT consultancies I had worked with before, and one of the things I picked up from that — and from searching on job boards — was that the number of roles had decreased.\n\nWhen it comes to looking for work, LinkedIn becomes your daily go-to tool. For someone with ADHD, it's a double-edged sword. You can set up filters and get told when new jobs are coming up. But it's also this meandering pathway of links that you can disappear down for hours and hours. It can become another doomscrolling mechanism. I'm guilty of doing a lot of that.\n\nI noticed a slow but steady increase in posts about \"I've been out of work for six months\" and \"I'm going to have to sell my house. I don't know how I'm going to look after my kids.\" The negativity — it impacts you.\n\nAt one point, I got a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter who worked for a digital-transformation company who said, \"We think you'd be suited for this role.\" It was for a senior project manager. I had two video interviews. Both went really well, but one of the things I noticed was that executives were a lot younger than me.\n\nI then got an email back asking to meet for 30 minutes with the practice lead. It felt like a check for cultural fit. She seemed to be a bit younger than me. We seemed to hit off pretty well. We talked about what I wanted from the role and what I could offer. Then, a couple of days later, the company said, \"You're too senior.\"\n\nYou cannot discriminate against someone because of their age, but it happens in myriad ways. \"Too senior\" is one of them. So is \"too much experience.\" I asked for feedback and was told, \"I wasn't sure that this would be fulfilling for you.\" I thought, \"How condescending. You approached me about this role, and I've read the job description, and we spoke at length about the role with three people. Not once have I said, 'This is beneath me.'\"\n\nAgeism is hidden in things like \"This is a dynamic, fast-paced work environment\" or \"This is a work-hard, play-hard environment.\" You take that to mean that on Friday afternoon, when we finish early, and all go down the pub, we don't want people who have to go pick up their kids. It's hidden, but it's still there.\n\nI'm 48. The problem is I look older. I'm Father Christmas in training. It's gotten to the point where I've had interviews and thought, \"Should I dye my hair? Should I wear a hat? Should I do something to try to look younger? Experience shouldn't be something you have to hide.\n\nI'm going to start my own thing. I have a concept for an app. I've been speaking with some non-executive directors and entrepreneurial advisors, getting advice and putting a strategy together. I have a background in product and technology. I can just bloody do this myself.\n\nI'm coming off LinkedIn because I need a bit more positivity. The promise I've made to myself is that the day I return, my first post will be, \"I am the founder of this thing, and I've come back to recruit. If you're too old, I want your experience. If you're too neurodiverse, I want your alternative perspective.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your job search? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Airlines are cracking down on power banks. Here's how you can avoid adding to the growing number of lithium battery accidents on planes.",
    "description": "Incidents involving lithium batteries are getting more common, so airlines are getting stricter about power banks due to the fire risk.",
    "fullText": "In late January, an Airbus A321 was running 20 minutes behind schedule as it prepared to taxi at Gimhae International Airport in Busan, South Korea.\n\nThen, a fire broke out in an overhead bin.\n\nThe inflatable slides were deployed as all 176 people evacuated the Air Busan plane, although 27 of them were injured. The aircraft was destroyed by the flames.\n\nAuthorities later said the fire was likely caused by a power bank after its insulation broke down.\n\nSince then, 2025 has seen such devices come under sharp focus for aviation safety.\n\nPower banks, laptops, and phones are all powered by lithium batteries. They pose a fire risk due to a process called thermal runaway: If the battery is damaged or overcharged, it can spark a chain reaction and a rapid rise in temperature.\n\nTwo weeks after the incident in Busan, South Korea's transport ministry announced a ban on storing power banks and e-cigarettes in the overhead bins. It also said they could no longer be charged using a plane's USB ports.\n\nSeveral airlines around the world have also introduced similar rules this year.\n\nThat includes Southwest Airlines, which did so in late May. One day later, a smoking battery charger caused a Southwest flight to divert an hour into its journey from Baltimore to Tampa.\n\nBut while the Air Busan fire appears to have prompted the wider crackdown, incidents involving lithium batteries had already become more common.\n\nAs of mid-December, the Federal Aviation Administration has recorded 80 verified incidents this year, and 89 in 2024. Before the pandemic, there were no more than 50 in any year.\n\nThat means it's gone from happening less than once a week to around every four days on average.\n\nOne reason such incidents have become more common is simply that more people own more electronic devices.\n\nHowever, airlines appear to be particularly concerned about power banks.\n\nThe growing market means that many of them are cheaply made and not properly certified. They may also lack the advanced circuitry that helps stop laptops and phones from overcharging.\n\nRising incident numbers prompted the FAA to issue a safety alert in early September. It recommended that airlines review their firefighting processes and their safety messages to passengers.\n\nThat includes educating travelers and ensuring their devices are kept visible and accessible.\n\nThis means that smoke or a fire can be spotted more quickly than if the device were in an overhead bin.\n\nEven if you're flying with an airline that hasn't mandated it, it's safer to make sure your device is visible while in use, so flight attendants can react if anything goes wrong.\n\nAirline crews are well-trained in dealing with fires. Incidents recorded by the FAA this year have seen flight attendants handle smoking power banks with specialized containment bags, fire extinguishers, and by submerging them in water.\n\nIf you notice your power bank swelling, hissing, or smelling like chemicals, stop using it immediately.\n\nAustralian airlines are the latest to introduce new rules, taking effect in mid-December.\n\nIt follows a July incident where a power bank caught fire in the overhead bin of a Virgin Australia flight. The plane landed safely, though one person was treated for smoke inhalation.\n\nAnd in November, around 150 people were evacuated from a Qantas lounge at Melbourne Airport when a man was burned by a power bank that caught fire in his pocket.\n\nWhile Southwest Airlines is so far the only major US carrier to tighten its power bank rules, other incidents indicate a heightened awareness.\n\nThis fall, two transatlantic United Airlines flights U-turned after a passenger dropped their laptop down the side of their seat and into the cargo hold.\n\nSince the devices were inaccessible, crews might not have known if they had caught fire until it was too late. That's especially risky while flying over an ocean with nowhere to land, so they diverted out of an excess of caution to retrieve the laptops.\n\nTraveling by air has only become the safest form of transport since regulators have learned from different incidents over the years.\n\nUPS Airlines suffered its first fatal crash in 2010, when a fire broke out on board a Boeing 747 shortly after departing Dubai.\n\nFlight 6 was carrying more than 80,000 lithium batteries, which ignited. Thick smoke entered the flight deck, obscuring the pilots' vision, and the captain passed out. With fire-damaged controls, the first officer was unable to direct the plane back to the airport.\n\nIn their final report, investigators made 36 safety recommendations. Regulators imposed stricter rules on how lithium batteries could be packaged and shipped, and banned them as cargo on passenger flights.\n\nIn 2012, the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization reinforced its existing ban on spare lithium batteries from checked baggage. The following year, it made clear that power banks also fall under this category.\n\nAs power banks continue to start smoking on flights, and since the FAA's safety alert, it's likely that more airlines will tighten their rules.",

    "description": "Adding a de-load week to your routine can help you build muscle and strength for efficiently. A powerlifting doctor said she de-loads every six weeks.",
    "fullText": "Working hard in the gym without seeing results?\n\nA short rest may help you break that plateau, according to a doctor who set state and national records in powerlifting.\n\nDr. Shernan Holtan, a hematologist and busy mom of two, has been lifting weights for over a decade. She hits the gym at 5:30 a.m. for an hour of training before heading to her day job as chief of blood and marrow transplant at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nHer key to avoiding physical burnout and keeping up gains: Every four to six weeks, she eases up on her training to let her body recover and build back stronger.\n\n\"You give yourself a break. Come back, lower the weight drastically for a week, and really just let your body soak up all of the stress that you just put it through to let it repair and heal,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nThe strategic break is commonly referred to in the fitness world as a \"de-load week.\" It's an evidence-backed way to smash through plateaus, reduce the risk of injury, and boost muscle and strength gains for everyone from elite powerlifters and bodybuilders to everyday athletes.\n\nFor Holtan, deloads have enabled her to maintain steady progress for years, gradually building up the strength to squat 225 pounds (or more) for reps. In that time, she's also started running and CrossFit, in addition to hiking, biking, and going to the gym (sometimes with her teenage daughter).\n\n\"I exercise every day, but I'm not doing crazy stuff every day,\" she said.\n\nHere's how to know if you should take a deload, and the right way to rest for better fitness.\n\nUnless you're a pro athlete, less can be more when it comes to exercise.\n\nThat's because muscle and strength gains only happen during the rest periods between gym sessions. A good gym session can break down muscle fibers, prompting them to grow back stronger, but only if you provide them with the time and resources (energy in the form of sufficient calories and protein) to recover.\n\nHoltan said to think of it as a slow and steady effort over time, rather than going all-out at the gym (and being too sore to come back).\n\n\"It's little micro adjustments, tiny increases in weight, a few extra reps,\" she said.\n\nThen, over the weeks and months of training, a de-load can help your body to reset and keep making progress.\n\nA de-load can also be a full rest from exercise, and can be a good idea during a vacation or holiday, so you can fully enjoy the time off.\n\nThe right time to take a rest can vary depending on your training and goals. Trainers typically recommend taking a break every four to 12 weeks.\n\nThe length of the rest can vary too.\n\nIf you're consistently in the gym three times a week, you may only need a day or two to deload, and can go two or three months between breaks. Competitive athletes who train five or more days a week might benefit from longer breaks every month or two.\n\nHoltan focuses on a specific goal for four to six weeks, then rests and repeats with a slightly different goal.\n\nFor instance, she might spend a month or so building up to a heavy one-rep max deadlift, bench press, and squat. After her deload week, she might focus on lifting moderate weight for more reps.\n\nThis is a type of training cycle known as periodization, which can help prevent athletes from overtraining or getting stuck in a rut.\n\nListening to your body can also signal that a rest might be beneficial.\n\nIf you're just not enjoying the gym, struggle to finish a workout ,or need to foam roll the pain away, an extra rest day might be just what you need.",

We have to learn from it and move on,\" Murphy added.\n\n\"We did talk about that last week and now it's a second defeat on the bounce. That's something we want to try and change pretty quickly.\n\n\"We'll park this, prepare for Connacht and move on.\"",

    "title": "Building a Multi- Site Kubernetes Cluster with BGP Anycast",
    "description": "How I connected Kubernetes clusters across 4 countries with my own ASN, BGP peering, and perhaps too many IPsec tunnels",
    "fullText": "I had a perfectly stable single-site Kubernetes cluster in the Netherlands. It worked, it was reliable, and by any reasonable measure, it was enough. But I have learned over the years that when things become too stable, too predictable, I start looking for the next challenge; this pattern has followed me throughout my career, moving on whenever circumstances headed toward a stale that was beyond my control to influence.\n\nThe initial justification was disaster recovery — what happens if the house burns down? All that work, gone. But if I am being honest with myself, DR was merely the acceptable excuse; the real motivation was the desire to understand how the internet actually works at the routing level, to own that knowledge rather than abstracting it away behind managed services.\n\nHence, the project scope expanded: not just a second site, but my own Autonomous System Number, my own IP space, actual BGP peering with upstream providers and an internet exchange. The kind of infrastructure I had only ever seen from the outside during my years in enterprise environments.\n\nAS214304 is my own Autonomous System Number, and 2a0c:9a40:8e20::/48 is the IPv6 prefix registered via RIPE NCC (sponsored by iFog GmbH, who have been excellent for hobbyist allocations).\n\nThe infrastructure spans 20 nodes across four European countries:\n\nConnecting it all: 39 FRR BGP sessions, 4 Cilium BGP sessions, and 12 IPsec tunnels forming a full mesh between sites. The encrypted tunnel topology links Cisco ASA on the on-prem side with strongSwan on the cloud edge nodes.\n\nTraffic flow: IPv6 anycast reaches whichever edge node is closest, then traverses the IPsec mesh to the Kubernetes clusters running Cilium with native BGP control plane for dynamic pod routing. NAT64 at the edge enables IPv6 ingress to the IPv4 core, while dual-stack anycast with SNI-based routing handles IPv4 traffic on shared IPs.\n\nDual transit provides upstream connectivity: Terrahost AS56655 in Norway and iFog AS34927 in Switzerland. Beyond transit, I peer with the FogIXP route servers (AS47498), which provides direct access to over 3,500 peer prefixes — traffic to those networks bypasses transit entirely.\n\nAcross three independent upstream paths, the setup receives the full IPv6 routing table: 234,000+ prefixes. RPKI/ROA validation ensures route origin authenticity, with BGPalerter providing real-time monitoring for hijacks or leaks.\n\nGetting the first session established was an experience in patience and attention to detail. Many hours staring at show bgp summary wondering why the state remained stubbornly “Active” rather than “Established.” The cause, eventually, was a typo in the peer AS number — the kind of mistake that feels embarrassing in retrospect but is apparently universal among anyone who has configured BGP for the first time.\n\nThere is a particular satisfaction in watching my /48 prefix propagate through the global routing table, seeing AS6939, AS174, AS3356 appear in the path — Hurricane Electric, Cogent, Lumen, the Tier 1 carriers that form the backbone of the internet, now routing traffic to infrastructure running partly in my apartment. This is what I wanted to understand, and now I do.\n\nMy prefix reaching Tier 1 ISPs through iFog and Terrahost — Hurricane Electric, Cogent, Lumen, and friends actually routing my homelab traffic.\n\nThere is a moment, after weeks of debugging individual components in isolation, when you look at the system as a whole and realize it is actually working. Dozens of BGP sessions exchanging routes simultaneously across the iBGP mesh over IPsec: edge nodes announcing my prefix to upstream providers and the IXP, receiving the full internet routing table back, propagating it inward to the on-prem clusters where Cilium advertises pod and service IPs to the network.\n\nAll of this happening across encrypted tunnels spanning four countries.\n\nI may have said something unprofessional out loud.\n\nThe migration from Flannel to Cilium was, according to everyone I consulted, supposed to be risky. Downtime was expected. Connectivity loss was anticipated. I followed the documentation carefully, proceeded node by node, and… nothing broke. The same with ClusterMesh — enabled, configured, and the clusters discovered each other without incident.\n\nPerhaps I was fortunate. Perhaps the documentation is simply excellent. Either way, I have no dramatic war stories to share here, which is honestly the best possible outcome.\n\nInfrastructure at this scale requires visibility. Grafana dashboards with Thanos handle metrics federation across sites, LibreNMS monitors the network devices, and Oxidized maintains configuration backups for the routers and firewalls. GitLab CI/CD pipelines automate infrastructure deployment — changes go through merge requests, not SSH sessions.\n\nI attempted to learn Kubernetes, GitOps, and BGP simultaneously, while also completing Coursera courses for CKA preparation and Cisco NetDevOps certifications, while also building what amounts to production infrastructure. This approach is not one I would recommend.\n\nThe context switching was relentless — debugging a Cilium network policy with three browser tabs open about BGP path selection and another about Terraform state management. I followed my impulses and moved fast into domains where I had limited foundation, and while the results eventually worked, the process was more chaotic than it needed to be.\n\nThe plan now is to slow down and approach the fundamentals more deliberately. Kubestronaut (all five Kubernetes certifications) is the goal, but properly this time, with the discipline I should have exercised from the beginning.\n\nThe current architecture is complete and stable, but there is always room for refinement. Consolidating more BGP responsibility into Cilium’s control plane might simplify the topology. Additional IXP peerings would improve path diversity further.\n\nAnd documentation. I should write documentation before I forget how all of this actually works.\n\nFor those interested in attempting something similar:\n\nQuestions or comments? You can find me on LinkedIn or review sanitized configurations on GitHub.",

    "fullText": "Analysts see ‘global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing’ amid surge in demand from AI boom\n\nA new report finds that investment in the worldwide data center market reached $61bn this year, setting a new record atop the wave of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe analysis by S&P Global, first reported by CNBC, documented what the market intelligence firm called a “global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing”, to build out the massive real estate, hardware, and energy requirements driven by insatiable demand from AI companies. S&P pegged 2024’s investment in the data center market at $60.8bn, just below the 2025 number.\n\n“Unable to buy, many investors are turning to new builds,” wrote Iuri Struta, an analyst for S&P Global.\n\nThere are approximately 500 data centers in the United Kingdom, compared with about 4,000 in the United States, according to Data Center Map, which tracks the facilities globally.\n\nStruta, the S&P Global analyst, said he does not see the demand for data centers slowing.\n\n“The global data center footprint is projected to expand at a faster rate over the next five years than it did in the previous five, spurred by demand for energy- and computer-intensive AI workloads,” said Struta.\n\nS&P Global’s report comes at a time when some investors worry that the entire artificial intelligence sector may be in the midst of huge overspending for unproven ongoing returns.\n\nLast week, Oracle’s shares dropped 11% after it reported lower quarterly earnings than analysts had expected, which in turn dragged the stock prices on some other major companies in AI. Some companies such as Oracle, along with Nvidia and OpenAI, have been criticized recently for making deals with one another that seem circular to many investors.\n\nEarlier this year, the International Energy Agency noted in a lengthy report that, globally, “electricity demand for data centres more than doubles by 2030”, reaching 945 terawatt hours (TWh), or just more than “Japan’s total electricity consumption today”.\n\nThis month, a trio of analysts from Deutsche Bank put out a staggering chart indicating that OpenAI alone will burn through $143bn between 2024 and 2029, the year before the company claims it will turn a profit. That chart shows how much more the ChatGPT maker, seen as a bellwether of the AI industry, plans to spend relative to other tech giants of the last two decades, including Amazon, Tesla and Uber, reached profitability.\n\n“Of course, OpenAI may continue to attract significant funding and could ultimately develop products that generate substantial profits and revolutionise the world,” Jim Reid, managing director, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank, wrote.\n\n“But at present, no startup in history has operated with losses on anything approaching this scale. We are firmly in uncharted territory.”",

    "fullText": "Decision from state supreme court on deal once worth $56bn and now worth some $139bn overturns ruling that prompted angry Musk backlash\n\nElon Musk’s controversial $56bn pay package from Tesla was reinstated by the Delaware supreme court on Friday, two years after a lower court struck down the vast compensation deal as “unfathomable”.\n\nThe reinstated pay package could be worth as much as $139bn today, according to the New York Times. The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan that could be worth $1tn to Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time. Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn.\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\n\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or \n\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\n\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\n\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\n\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\n\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\n\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.",

    "fullText": "Opener Zak Crawley suggested he was not aware of comments made by Ben Stokes when the England captain said his dressing room is \"not a place for weak men\".\n\nStokes made the statement in multiple interviews following England's defeat in the second Ashes Test against Australia earlier this month.\n\nIn the run-up to the third Test, in which England are set to be beaten to lose the series at the earliest opportunity, Stokes said he had let his message \"drift around\" his players.\n\n\"I've done all the talking over the past two days that I needed to have done,\" said the all-rounder.\n\nBut after Crawley made 85 on the fourth day of the third Test in Adelaide, he said: \"I didn't see that.\n\n\"I didn't see and wasn't really looking out for it. We take everything that is said in the media with a pinch of salt.\"\n\nStokes made the \"weak men\" comment after England were beaten in Brisbane to go 2-0 down.\n\nThe England squad subsequently went on holiday to Noosa between the second and third Tests.\n\nBefore this match in Adelaide, Stokes said his team had held \"raw\" conversations. The captain also asked his players to \"show a bit of dog\" in their battle to remain in the series.\n\nBut Kent's Crawley stated the messaging from Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum had remained consistent with their previous three years in charge.\n\n\"It's been very positive, the same as always,\" said Crawley. \"[It's] just trying to be optimistic, play our way, with lots of freedom. It felt like we could do something special going into this game.\"",

    "fullText": "Third Ashes Test, Adelaide Oval (day four of five)\n\nAustralia 371: Carey 106; Archer 5-53 & 349: Head 170; Tongue 4-70\n\nEngland 286: Stokes 83; Boland 3-45 & 207-6: Crawley 85; Cummins 3-24\n\nAustralia need four wickets to retain Ashes\n\nEngland are on the brink of an Ashes series defeat after Australia's Nathan Lyon broke their resistance late on the fourth day of the third Test in Adelaide.\n\nOff-spinner Lyon removed a reverse-sweeping Harry Brook, bowled Ben Stokes and, crucially, had Zak Crawley stumped to move the home side within touching distance of the urn.\n\nCrawley compiled an impressive 85, but when he was seduced by a delirious Lyon, England were left 194-6 in pursuit of a notional target of 435.\n\nAustralia will return on Sunday needing four more wickets to go 3-0 up after three Tests, retain the Ashes after only 11 days of cricket and win a fourth consecutive home series against England.\n\nLyon's intervention – England lost three wickets for 17 runs in six overs – came after the tourists finally showed a willingness to adapt their Bazballing ways.\n\nIt was the recognition of the situation and a realisation that some players – Crawley included – are fighting for their futures and reputations.\n\nAfter Stokes returned to bowling with seven overs from the start of play, the tourists took the last six Australia wickets for 38 runs to dismiss the hosts for 349 in their second innings.\n\nTravis Head was eventually out for 170 and Alex Carey 72. Josh Tongue ended with 4-70 and Brydon Carse 3-80.\n\nA four-day finish felt probable when Ben Duckett was out in the first over of England's chase and Ollie Pope is in huge danger of being dropped for the fourth Test after falling for 17.\n\nThen came Crawley's show of defiance, ended by the genius of Lyon.\n\nCrawley not aware of Stokes' 'weak men' comments\n\nStupid or valid? Did Brook's shot put Australia on the brink?\n\nThe Ashes: Australia four wickets away from retaining urn after day four - reaction\n\nIs England's approach on this fourth day in Adelaide a welcome epiphany that their previous over-aggression was misplaced, or a frustrating reveal they were always capable of playing in this fashion?\n\nAnd even when England were employing an orthodox method of Test batting, they eventually buckled to the relentless Australians.\n\nDuckett's collapse in form is alarming – the opener has a highest score of 29 in this series.\n\nPope might feel unlucky to have fallen to Marnus Labuschagne's breathtaking one-handed catch at second slip, but this was yet another failure against Australia.\n\nPope has played 16 Ashes innings and averages 17.62. Only one other England player since 1900 – Dennis Amiss – has played as many Ashes knocks in the top six and produced a lower average.\n\nAll of Crawley, Joe Root and Brook had successfully used the reverse-sweep against Lyon until Brook was bowled. Despite the logic of the stroke, it looked ugly and was made worse by what followed.\n\nAs the total attendance for the Test went past 200,000 – a record for the Adelaide Oval – showman Lyon had the expectant crowd in the palm of his hand.\n\nJamie Smith and Will Jacks somehow survived until the close – a delay of the inevitable.\n\nSeveral England players are fighting to finish the series, let alone be part of the post-Ashes rebuild. Crawley, so often the subject of scrutiny at the top of the order, has put himself in the conversation to be part of England's future.\n\nAt 31-2, the smart money was on an England capitulation, only for Crawley to produce the grittiest knock of his 62-Test career.\n\nThe Kent man added 78 with Root, then 68 with Brook. He scored only one run from the first 28 deliveries he faced, leaving well and defending solidly. The 102 balls he took to pass 50 was the second-slowest half-century of his Test career.\n\nPat Cummins wound up for a crucial spell after tea and had Root caught behind, the 13th time the Australia captain has dismissed the Yorkshireman in Test cricket – no other bowler has done so as often. Root screamed in frustration as he departed for 39.\n\nBar an attempted scoop at Scott Boland, Brook backed up his watchful 45 in the first innings with a careful 30 from 56 balls. Lyon struggled on a turning pitch until Brook's gift and, for all the validity of the shot, the dismissal is sure to attract criticism.\n\nIt opened the door for the Australia spinner, and Crawley's departure was the hammer blow.\n\nAs Australia resumed on 271-4, England could have been facing two sessions in the field while the home side piled on runs at will. Instead, the fight the tourists showed early on Saturday was commendable.\n\nThere were concerns about Stokes' fitness when he did not bowl on the third day, only for the captain to immediately take the ball on the fourth morning.\n\nWhile Stokes was tight, Carse leaked 26 runs from three overs and gave way to Tongue, who enticed Head into a miscue to Crawley at deep square leg.\n\nAfter Stokes had Carey fall into a clever leg-slip trap and Tongue found the edge of Josh Inglis, England surged with the second new ball.\n\nCarse had Cummins caught at slip and Lyon lbw in successive balls, before Jofra Archer did well to hold Boland in his follow-through.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Such was the oddity of Anthony Joshua v Jake Paul even taking place, the fight landed on Netflix under a cloud of suspicion that boxing had surrendered itself to choreography.\n\nTo be clear, this was a sanctioned professional contest, not a scripted event - and the storyline it produced was mundane and predictably one-sided.\n\nNo scriptwriter would have come up with something like this.\n\nThe plot played out in the ring was lifeless - a slow, joyless watch that would have struggled to earn even a charitable rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nAnd the ultimate irony is that this spectacle has provided one of Joshua's biggest paydays and, in all likelihood, his largest television audience.\n\nWith seconds remaining in the fourth round, referee Christopher Young perhaps spoke for viewers around the world when he pulled the fighters together and urged them to engage.\n\nDirecting his comments at Paul, he said: \"Fans didn't pay to see this crap.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" replied Netflix commentator Mauro Ranallo. \"Christopher Young with the call of the night.\"\n\nAll week Joshua spoke about \"carrying boxing on his back\". On Friday night in Miami, he dumped the load, but only after an awkward and laboured process.\n\nThe man who spent fight week promising the greatest upset in sporting history instead avoided engagement.\n\nHe circled endlessly - making the most of the space afford by a ring two feet wider than normal - and attempted to run down the clock.\n\nWhen he did make contact, it was with echoes of his schoolboy past as a wrestler, constantly going low and grabbing Joshua's leg.\n\nThere was an embarrassing lack of punches by Paul and a litany of wild swings from Joshua that even a novice like his opponent was able to easily evade.\n\n\"It's a win but it's not a success,\" Joshua said afterwards. \"I've got a lot of improving I've got to do. I'm not happy.\"\n\nJoshua earned his share of a reported £210m purse, but from a boxing perspective - and for those in the UK who stayed up into the early hours to watch - the contest was meaningless.",

    "title": "Intel's new Arizona fab, where the chipmaker's fate hangs in the balance",
    "description": "At Intel’s new fab in Arizona, 18A is in high-volume production. With no major outside customers and a 10% government stake, is it enough to save the chipmaker?",
    "fullText": "Intel was once the world's largest semiconductor company, but its market cap plummeted in recent years as the chipmaker fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and spent billions of dollars trying to catch up.\n\nNow, Intel has entered high-volume production of 18A, the new chip node it says will turn things around.\n\nThe biggest problem? Convincing a big chipmaker to trust Intel with manufacturing on the new node. For now, Intel's only major customer is itself. The company's long-awaited Core Ultra series 3 PC processor, code-named Panther Lake, will come to PCs in January as the first major product made on 18A.\n\n\"It's become an internal node for now,\" said Daniel Newman, CEO of Futurum Group. \"So many companies have made such massive investments into TSMC to ensure yield, to ensure capacity wafers that they just will not make the switch just yet.\"\n\nIntel is pinning its hopes of attracting customers on a new chip fabrication plant, Fab52, in Chandler, Arizona, where CNBC got an exclusive on-camera tour in November. Some 50 miles north, in Phoenix, TSMC also has a new fab, where it's making chips with 4 nanometer technology. Its most advanced 2nm tech is currently only made in Taiwan.\n\nIntel's 18A is generally on par with TSMC's 2nm node in some metrics such as transistor density. But as Intel works out the kinks after years of delays on previous nodes, some 18A wafers have had defects, making for a lower number of usable chips per wafer, typically referred to as yield.\n\n\"Yields are always an issue at the advanced node. This is not an uncommon problem,\" said Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie, who served on Intel's board from 1989 to 2018. He pointed to early yield issues with Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs at TSMC that were quickly fixed.\n\nIntel's renewed focus on foundry — manufacturing chips for outside clients — came when Pat Gelsinger took the helm as CEO in 2021. Gelsinger was pushed out last December and replaced by Lip-Bu Tan in March.\n\n\"Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon – without adequate demand,\" Tan wrote in a memo in July.\n\nWith Intel awaiting a big outside customer, the U.S. government stepped up in August, taking a 10% stake in the company with an $8.9 billion investment, primarily coming from grants promised under the CHIPS Act signed by President Joe Biden in 2022.\n\nDays earlier, SoftBank invested $2 billion in Intel, followed by a $5 billion investment in September from Nvidia, which agreed to use some Intel technology but didn't commit to using its foundry.\n\nHere's a look behind the curtain of Intel's new chip factory where it hopes to find major foundry customers and, with them, redemption.\n\nFounded in 1968 by Silicon Valley chip pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and legendary investor Arthur Rock, Intel brought the world's first commercially available microprocessor to market just three years later.\n\nFrom the late 1970s through the early 2000s, Intel pumped out increasingly advanced process nodes at a rapid pace, leading to the term \"Moore's Law\" — the doubling of components on a chip every couple years.\n\n\"The 1990s was a period of wonder and excitement at Intel,\" Yoffie said. \"We were the world's largest semiconductor company, the world's most profitable.\"\n\nBut Intel largely missed the mobile revolution, famously turning down a deal to make Apple's processors for the original iPhone. Then came a whiff in AI.\n\nIn 2024, Intel saw its worst year ever, losing about 60% of its value. The plunge came after two of its previous chip nodes, 10nm and 7nm, were delayed by several years. Analysts say the delays may have been triggered by an earlier choice to hold off on using ASML's costly Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machines.\n\n\"I think we lost the discipline of cycle time,\" said client computing head Jim Johnson, who joined Intel more than 30 years ago. \"Cycle time requires you to commit and deliver, and we started talking ourselves into, hey, we can have longer cycle times and try and lift more or do more.\"\n\nAs it hustles to get back on track, Intel told CNBC there will be at least 15 EUV machines in Fab52.\n\nIn his earlier stint at Intel, more than a decade before rejoining as CEO, Gelsinger \"was given the responsibility to build a GPU to compete with Nvidia,\" Yoffie said. \"Unfortunately, that project failed and that ultimately meant we ended up not playing a significant role in the AI revolution.\"\n\nIntel may now be considering a deal to buy custom AI chip design startup SambaNova for $1.6 billion, though the company declined to comment on the matter.\n\nThe trademark of Gelsinger's tenure as CEO was Intel's focus on chip manufacturing. His ambitious roadmap had Intel catching back up to TSMC by releasing five nodes in four years.\n\nNow, Tan is CEO and Naga Chandrasekaran is in charge of foundry.\n\n\"We are making yield improvements, defect density improvements, month-over-month and hitting our goals,\" Chandrasekaran told CNBC in an interview in November. \"So I believe we have turned the corner.\"\n\nChandrasekaran joined Intel last year after more than two decades at leading memory maker Micron. He said his top goal is finding foundry customers.\n\n\"I have to become part of their team and convince them that they can trust Intel Foundry to execute,\" Chandrasekaran said. \"That's number one. And to do that, we are changing our culture. We are bringing a huge execution focus internally into Intel Foundry.\"\n\nChandrasekaran told CNBC that Fab52 is capable of more than 10,000 18A wafer starts per week. There's more than a million square feet of manufacturing cleanroom space in Arizona, with five fabs all connected by 30 miles of overhead track moving wafers between them. A sixth fab, Fab62, is expected to be ready around 2028.\n\n18A also uses RibbonFet, Intel's gate-all-around architecture that improves power control by fully surrounding the transistor, unlike previous designs that only contact the top and sides. Chandrasekaran said 18A offers \"more than 15% performance per watt improvement\" over Intel 3.\n\nPerhaps the biggest way Intel stands out is in advanced packaging, the assembly and connections of chips onto the final systems where they appear in real-world applications.\n\nCNBC went to Intel's advanced packaging lab in Chandler to see several steps in the process, such as protecting chips with a polymer-based seal, and exposing them to a liquid that detects any defects. Yoffie said Intel's advanced packaging \"can help mitigate some of the power consumption problems.\"\n\n\"One of the biggest problems today for everybody making chips for data centers is the power that it consumes,\" Yoffie said.\n\nChandrasekaran said the Arizona fab is on almost 100% renewable energy. As for water, Intel's Arizona facilities used more than 3 billion gallons in 2024 and returned 2.4 billion gallons to the local supply through a water recycling plant it has on site.\n\nTan's message to employees when it comes to spending on future foundry nodes is clear: \"No more blank checks.\" The company needs customers.\n\nIntel's big new Ohio chip fab is delayed until at least 2030, and Tan has made major cost cuts by slashing 15% of the workforce in July and axing projects in Germany and Poland.\n\n\"That's what the company needed,\" said Newman of Futurum. \"It needed to be faster. It needed to be leaner. It needed to be more focused. It needed someone that would be a little bit more shrewd.\"\n\nTan is waiting to see how demand shapes up before giving solid details about Intel's next node, 14A.  Chandrasekaran told CNBC it will first be developed in Oregon, with a goal of volume production in 2028.\n\nFinding customers for 18A won't be easy. Unlike TSMC which only makes chips for outside clients, Intel also makes devices powered by its chips, positioning it as a competitor to some of the customers it hopes to land.\n\n\"If I'm an Nvidia or AMD or Qualcomm or Broadcom, do you really want to put your secret sauce into a manufacturing operation where you're giving Intel access to that secret sauce?\" Yoffie said.\n\nHe suggests breaking out foundry into a different company.\n\n\"If you actually separated the two, I think you'd give Intel a much better shot at being successful,\" Yoffie said. \"And you'd also give the United States a much stronger position for being the home of a major semiconductor manufacturing organization.\"\n\nFor now, Intel hopes Panther Lake will be a big proof point when it debuts in PCs from major companies like Samsung, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus and Acer in January. Intel's next data center chip, Xeon 6+, is also made on 18A.\n\n\"If you're a major company that wants to bet on a process node, you're going to feel a lot more comfortable if you see Intel ramping the heart of their client product line to high volume on that process node,\" Johnson said.\n\nMicrosoft and Amazon signed early deals last year committing to use Intel's foundry for some of their in-house custom chips.\n\n\"It's a good sign, but of course their volumes are very small relative to Nvidia and the other major chip companies,\" Yoffie said.\n\nRecent reports suggest AMD is considering manufacturing at Intel, and one analyst predicts Apple may once again make some Mac chips at Intel by 2027.\n\nIn the meantime, Intel got a lifeline with the U.S. government's 10% stake.\n\n\"It shows the confidence that the U.S. government has in Intel and the belief that we need to have leading edge R&D and manufacturing on U.S. soil,\" Chandrasekaran said.\n\nThe government investment came days after President Donald Trump called for Tan to resign, then reversed course.\n\n\"I worry sometimes about the scope creep here and how the U.S. could decide to take stakes in all kinds of things,\" Newman said. \"But you have industries that we have let leave the U.S. to an extent that put us into indefensible risk, and we need to bring them back.\"\n\nSome 92% of the world's most advanced chips are made in Taiwan, following a decades-long decline in the percentage of chips made in the U.S.\n\n\"The stakes are incredibly high for Intel, for the U.S. and for the world,\" Yoffie said. \"The whole idea that the world's most advanced products are dependent on a single location in an island a few miles off the Chinese coast is a terrible situation for the whole world to have to deal with.\"\n\nChandrasekaran, for his part, is committed to turning Intel into a manufacturer of advanced chips.\n\n\"As a semiconductor community, we have to enable this solution for the world to move forward with AI,\" he said. \"There's no other option than to be successful.\"\n\nWATCH: Inside the Arizona chip fab key to Intel's redemption",

Bondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department’s charge to turn Mangione’s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a “profound conflict of interest” that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Luigi Mangione’s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi’s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer’s parent company.\n\nBondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department’s charge to turn Mangione’s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a “profound conflict of interest” that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 9.\n\nThey argued Bondi has continued to profit from her work for Ballard — and, indirectly, from its work for UnitedHealth Group — through a profit-sharing arrangement with the lobbying firm and a defined contribution plan it administers.\n\nThe “very person” empowered to seek Mangione’s death \"has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting,” his lawyers wrote. Her conflict of interest “should have caused her to recuse herself from making any decisions on this case,” they added.\n\nMessages seeking comment were left for the Justice Department and Ballard Partners.\n\nBondi announced in April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”\n\nThompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.\n\nMangione, 27, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison. Neither trial has been scheduled.\n\nFriday’s filing put the focus back on Mangione’s federal case a day after a marathon pretrial hearing ended in his fight to bar prosecutors in his state case from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to “wack” a health insurance executive. A ruling isn't expected until May.\n\nMangione’s defense team, led by the husband-and-wife duo of Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, zeroed in on Bondi’s past lobbying work as they seek to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, throw out some charges and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case.\n\nIn a September court filing, Mangione’s lawyers argued that Bondi’s announcement that she was ordering prosecutors to seek the death penalty — which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance — showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit.” They also said her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.\n\nBondi’s statements and other official actions — including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration’s flouting of established death penalty procedures — “have violated Mr. Mangione’s constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,” his lawyers said.\n\nIn a court filing last month, federal prosecutors argued that “pretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect.”\n\nRather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense’s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione’s rights are respected at trial.\n\n“What the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments” rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. “None warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.”\n\nMangione’s lawyers said they want to investigate Bondi’s ties to Ballard and the firm’s relationship with UnitedHealth Group and will ask for various materials, including details of Bondi’s compensation from the firm, any direction she's given Justice Department employees regarding the case or UnitedHealthcare, and sworn testimony from “all individuals with personal knowledge of the relevant matters.\"",

    "fullText": "A prominent Democrat on Wednesday told a reporter she would “stomp” Vice President JD Vance in a hypothetical presidential match-up.\n\nA new poll released by The Argument/Verasight found U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., beating Vance by 51% to 49%.\n\nWhen broken down by demographic, Ocasio-Cortez leads Vance among Black voters (79% to 21%), Hispanic voters (64% to 36%), voters who have a college education (56% to 44%), voters aged 18 to 29 (58% to 42%), voters aged 30 to 44 (51% to 49%) and women voters (56% to 44%).\n\nVance, meanwhile, leads among white voters (57% to 43%), voters aged 65 and older (52% to 48%), voters without a college education (51% to 49%) and voters who are men (54% to 46%).\n\nBoth politicians are tied at 50% with voters aged 45 to 64, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll was conducted between Dec. 5 to Dec. 11 with a sample size of 1,521 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.7%.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a potential Democratic candidate for president, raised interest on X when she re-posted the poll and posted the word: “Bloop!”\n\nWhen asked about the polls findings by Migrant Insider’s Pablo Manriquez, she initially dismissed it but then added: “But, let the record show: I would stomp him.”\n\nAxios previously reported that the representative’s team is preparing her for either a presidential or Senate run in 2028.\n\nRecent 2028 primary polls have shown California Gov. Gavin Newsom as the front-runner. In a previous interview with CBS News, Newsom said he would consider a presidential campaign after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nAn Echelon Insights poll released Dec. 16 shows Newsom as the top pick for Democratic voters, with 23% of respondents saying they would vote for him in a primary. Behind Newsom is former Vice President Kamala Harris with 22%, followed by former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg with 11%. Ocasio-Cortez placed behind Buttigieg with 9% support.\n\nThe poll was conducted between Dec. 11 and Dec. 15. Of the 1,011 voters who responded to the poll, 498 were surveyed for the hypothetical 2028 Democratic primary matchup.

    "description": "An executive who attended the event tells TheWrap Nick and Rob Reiner did not come to blows the night before the murders.",
    "fullText": "Rob Reiner and his son Nick did not have a blow-out argument at Conan O’Brien’s Christmas party despite reports to the contrary, a Hollywood executive who attended the Dec. 13 event told TheWrap Friday.\n\nAnonymous reports of a shouting match between the film legend and his addict son the night before Rob and Michele Reiner were found murdered in their Brentwood home have been published by Page Six and TMZ this week, with the New York Post calling it “a massive blow-up .” The Daily Mail reported Friday that O’Brien talked guests out of calling the police on the heated incident.\n\n“That’s bulls–t,” the executive told TheWrap of the Daily Mail’s reporting, dismayed at the increasingly sensational coverage of what happened at the Saturday fête. Nick Reiner, who was living in his parent’s back house at the time, did attend O’Brien’s holiday event and was acting erratically to the A-list guests, but there was no major blowout, the executive said.\n\nThe New York Times reported that accounts of a shouting match were “overblown,” TheWrap was told that O’Brien “saw no fight, no argument.”\n\n“There was this kid walking around making people feel uncomfortable. Eavesdropping on conversations and that kind of thing,” the individual, requesting anonymity, said.\n\nBut the attendee was vehement that O’Brien and guests did not witness a shouting match between Rob and Nick Reiner, adding, “If there had been a big fight with the Reiners, there were a million people there I knew. No one mentioned it to me.”\n\nThe attendee continued: “I said to Conan the next day – I said, ‘What is all this stuff about a fight?’ He said, ‘I saw no fight.'”\n\nAs for reports that Nick had a tiff with actor Bill Hader after a bizarre exchange at the party, the executive confirmed the screenwriter interrupted O’Brien and Hader mid-conversation and “acted a little strange,” but the encounter ended there.\n\nRepresentatives for O’Brien did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nNick Reiner, 32, was formally charged Tuesday with two counts of first-degree murder after being arrested on Sunday as the main suspect in his parents’ deaths, which were ruled later in the week as homicide by stabbing.\n\nThe charges came two days after he was picked up in Exposition Park, near the USC campus, hours after Rob and Michele were found by their daughter, Romy, stabbed to death in their Brentwood home.\n\nReiner’s charges carry a possible sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole — however, the decision regarding the death penalty is still pending, Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said Tuesday.\n\nThe 32-year-old Reiner made his first appearance in court on Wednesday, where he spoke only once, responding “Yes, your honor,” before the arraignment hearing was postponed to Jan. 7. A courtroom sketch showed Nick appearing in a blue jail-issued suicide prevention vest.\n\nNick’s attorney, Alan Jackson, has not shared specifics regarding his client’s mental health, but asked the public on Wednesday to allow the legal process to unfold “with restraint and with dignity.”\n\n“There are very, very complex and serious issues that are associated with this case,” the defense attorney said. “Things need to be thoroughly but very carefully dealt with and examined and analyzed.”\n\nOn Friday, multiple media reports were published that Nick had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and that his medication had changed before the Reiners’ murder.\n\nNick Reiner is currently being held without bail pending his arraignment.\n\nSharon Waxman contributed to this report.\n\nThe post No Reiner Fight at Conan O’Brien’s Party, Says Attendee: ‘It’s Bulls–t’ | Exclusive appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "MAGA women are fleeing D.C. in droves.\n\nNew York congresswoman and MAGA darling Elise Stefanik shocked the political world on Friday when she announced that she’s quitting politics. Less than 30 minutes earlier, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis had done the same thing.\n\nStefanik’s announcement is the more surprising of the two. The 41-year-old congresswoman was a rising star in MAGA circles and was seen as a lock to win June 2026’s GOP primary in New York’s gubernatorial race.\n\n“While spending precious time with my family this Christmas season, I have made the decision to suspend my campaign for Governor and will not seek re-election to Congress,” she wrote in a lengthy X post.\n\nStefanik indicated she was stepping out of politics to spend more time with her 4-year-old son, Sam.\n\n“While many know me as Congresswoman, my most important title is Mom,” she said. “I believe that being a parent is life’s greatest gift and greatest responsibility. I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness—particularly at his tender age.”\n\nStefanik has represented New York’s 21st district, which covers the state’s heavily Republican upstate area, since 2015.\n\nThough she initially was elected as a moderate Republican, she swung hard to the right during her time in Congress to become one of Trump’s most ardent supporters.\n\nShe was endorsed by Trump in 2021 to replace Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference Chair. She held the position until January 2025, when Trump nominated her to become the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. In March, Trump withdrew his nomination, saying that he needed her in the House of Representatives, where Republicans held a slim majority.\n\nIn November, Stefanik announced that she would run for governor of New York, bidding to unseat incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul. According to a December Siena poll, she held a huge lead over the other Republican in the race, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, but trailed Hochul by 19 points in a potential head-to-head.\n\nStefanik’s announcement comes three days after the release of that poll.\n\nTrump, 79, mourned the loss of one of his champions on Truth Social.\n\n“Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” the president wrote.\n\nIn contrast, Lummis’ retirement is less surprising—and did not merit a Truth Social sendoff from the president.\n\nLummis, 71, said in her announcement post that she decided not to seek re-election because she felt she did not have “six more years” in her. She will have served one term in the Senate when her seat goes up for election in 2026. Before her time as Senator, she served from 2009 to 2017 in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nOnce a free speech absolutist, Lummis changed her tune after the death of Charlie Kirk and the subsequent yanking of Jimmy Kimmel off the air for his comment that MAGA was desperate to paint Kirk’s assassin, Tyler Robinson, as non-MAGA.\n\nLummis didn’t even have a half-hour in the spotlight before Stefanik upstaged her.\n\nStefanik and Lummis are the latest Republicans to drop out of Congress after the shocking resignation of longtime MAGA loyalist-turned-foe Marjorie Taylor Greene. In the weeks following Greene’s announcement, an anonymous senior GOP lawmaker warned that more surprising departures would follow.\n\n“More explosive early resignations are coming,” said the lawmaker in November. “It’s a tinder box. Morale has never been lower. Mike Johnson will be stripped of his gavel, and they will lose the majority before this term is out.”",

    "fullText": "McKINNEY, Texas (AP) — Court documents detailing the divorce of Republican U.S. Senate candidate and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, were released Friday by order of a judge, months after she filed citing “biblical grounds.”\n\nThe initial filing showed that Angela Paxton sought the divorce on the grounds that Ken Paxton had committed adultery, but included no additional details. She had previously referenced “recent discoveries” when announcing the filing on social media in July. In a separate filing, Ken Paxton denied the allegations in the divorce petition. Future filings will also be released to the public after the Paxtons and a coalition of media outlets came to an agreement.\n\n“It’s a victory, I think, for the American public and for the Texas voters,” Tyler Bexley, an attorney for the media intervenors, told reporters after the judge ordered the documents unsealed.\n\nThe divorce and the surrounding speculation have only fueled attacks against Paxton in one of the nation’s most heated Republican primaries as he seeks to unseat Sen. John Cornyn. Whether the divorce details resonate with voters remains to be seen, with the Senate primary set for March 3. Despite years of controversy, the three-term attorney general has remained competitive in the race, which includes Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nThe divorce comes after 38 years of marriage, during which Angela Paxton had supported her husband through a series of legal troubles, including state and federal corruption investigations. A state securities fraud indictment against Ken Paxton was dismissed after a 2024 plea deal in which he agreed to pay restitution and complete community service, and the Justice Department dropped a federal corruption probe earlier this year.\n\nAngela Paxton also stood by Ken Paxton's side during that impeachment trial, which publicly exposed an extramarital affair. The 2023 impeachment trial ended in an acquittal for him.\n\nPaxton’s support in Texas has remained strong amid a decade of legal troubles. He won reelection in 2022 by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nPaxton launched his bid to unseat Cornyn in April and has since drawn attacks from Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, with some in the party concerned that while Paxton could prevail in the GOP primary, he may complicate the general election and force national Republicans to spend heavily to hold the seat. On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico are facing off in their party’s primary.\n\nGroups supporting Cornyn have spent more than $21 million on television ads this year, according to AdImpact, to promote the four-term senator and attack Paxton.\n\n“What Ken Paxton has put his family through is truly repulsive and disgusting,” National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said in July. “No one should have to endure what Angela Paxton has, and we pray for her as she chooses to stand up for herself and her family during this difficult time.”\n\nPaxton has been a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, while Cornyn has at times drawn criticism within his own party for working with Democrats. Trump’s endorsement is expected to be a decisive factor in Texas, which he won in 2024 by nearly 14 percentage points. Trump has not yet endorsed in the race.\n\nJudge Robert Brotherton approved the agreement on Friday to release the records, which had been sealed following a request by Angela Paxton shortly after she filed. Another judge signed the agreed order to seal the records. In a filing after media outlets and the nonprofit Campaign for Accountability intervened to have the documents unsealed, Ken Paxton said he was opposed to the documents being publicly released.\n\nBexley said Friday that the media outlets he represents believe that voters have the right to know information about the case as “they are making decisions in the upcoming elections.”\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Ken Paxton at https://apnews.com/hub/ken-paxton.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur welcome reigning champions Liverpool on Saturday evening, desperate to steady the ship after a bruising setback last time out.\n\nSpurs head into the contest on the back of a damaging 3-0 defeat that punctured the optimism built under Thomas Frank following some encouraging performances.\n\nThat loss leaves Tottenham languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League table.\n\nThe North Londoners are six points adrift of fourth place, and once again searching for consistency at a pivotal point in the season.\n\nFrank faces this high-profile test with his options stretched, as injuries and Africa Cup of Nations absences continue to bite.\n\nTottenham have blown hot and cold under Frank.\n\nJust as it appeared they were turning a corner, the collapse against Nottingham Forest exposed issues in midfield and around defensive protection.\n\nThe Spurs boss retains the backing of the board, but there are growing internal concerns.\n\nDefeat this weekend would see Tottenham suffer their 11th Premier League home loss of 2025, their worst return in a single calendar year.\n\nThere has at least been some improvement at home. Spurs have won three of their last five league games at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nFrank will hope that platform can help them take the fight to Liverpool.\n\nThe visitors arrive in North London unbeaten in five games in all competitions and buoyed by a 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nLiverpool have also enjoyed recent dominance in this fixture, winning the last two league meetings by an aggregate score of 9-1, including last season’s title-clinching victory.\n\nTottenham have lost three of their last five Premier League games and have already suffered 10 home league defeats in 2025.\n\nLiverpool have won both of their last two matches against Spurs, scoring nine goals in the process.\n\nSpurs have won only one of their last 15 league matches against Liverpool, a 2-1 victory for the home side after the visitors received two red cards.\n\nThe Reds have been utterly dominant in this fixture, and Tottenham must be desperate to turn things around.\n\nNEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 02: Archie Gray of Tottenham Hotspur warms up prior to the Premier League match between Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur at St James’ Park on December 02, 2025 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.

There could be a midfield reshuffle.\n\nArchie Gray endured a difficult afternoon at Nottingham Forest. The ‘fearless’ midfielder may make way for Joao Palhinha.\n\nThe Portuguese international (37 caps) offers greater defensive security alongside Rodrigo Bentancur.\n\nFrank was quick to defend Gray in his pre-match press conference, praising his mentality and response to adversity.\n\nHowever, Liverpool’s visit may require more experience in the engine room.\n\nOut wide, Mohammed Kudus and Xavi Simons are expected to continue behind Richarlison, while Randal Kolo Muani should retain his place on the right.\n\nRicharlison has been directly involved in seven goals against Liverpool in the Premier League (four goals and three assists), more than against any other opponent.\n\nGuglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Djed Spence; Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur; Mohammed Kudus, Xavi Simons, Randal Kolo Muani; Richarlison.",

He transferred to Oklahoma last offseason after having a breakout season at Washington State in 2024.\n\nAlthough Matter’s 2025 season at Oklahoma didn’t go as planned. He threw a career-high 10 interceptions and a career-low 12 touchdowns. That said, the QB also dealt with a hand injury he suffered early in the season.\n\nAlthough it seems unlikely, Mateer is also eligible to declare for the 2026 NFL Draft. His best options appear to be either returning to Oklahoma or transferring elsewhere in search of a fresh start.\n\nReturning to Oklahoma seems more likely, but the 2026 quarterback draft class is thin, so there’s a small chance Mateer could test the waters.\n\nMORE: Sporting News' 2025 College Football All-America team\n\nAnswering that question may become clearer in the coming weeks. For now, there are a lot of what-ifs. If Mateer returns in 2026, he is expected to be the Sooners’ starter, despite his struggles down the stretch this season. It remains uncertain whether Mateer’s backup, sophomore Michael Hawkins Jr., or third-stringer Whitt Newbauer will return.\n\nOklahoma also signed 4-star quarterback Bowe Bentley in its 2026 class, who is expected to compete for playing time. If Mateer leaves—or even if he stays—don’t be surprised if Brent Venables turns to the transfer portal for another quarterback.\n\nMORE: Where does Oklahoma’s Brent Venables rank among the country’s highest‑paid coaches?\n\nThe most glaring issue for the Sooners this season has been its offense. Oklahoma had just three games this season with over three touchdowns scored, and OU ranked just 49th in SP+ offensive efficiency earlier this months.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Venables had brought over Arbuckle as his new offensive coordinator just this past offseason. Whether or not he returns to Oklahoma remains to be seen, but the performance in 2025 has been pretty bad.\n\nTake a look at where Oklahoma's offense entered Friday night's game ranked:\n\nOf course, the good news for Oklahoma is this is an improvement in recent years. This is OU's first playoff bid since 2019, and the first under Venables.\n\nBut there's no question that letting down a 17-0 lead during a home playoff game isn't how Oklahoma fans envisioned this season ending. Heading into next season, there are still plenty of questions that need to be answered. \n\nMORE: Vanderbilt QB Diego Pavia named SN's College Football Player of the Year",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe stars are expected to be out in Miami, Florida on Friday night. While the College Football Playoff is kicking off, the sporting world will likely have its eyes on a marquee boxing fight.\n\nJake Paul is set to throw hands with Anthony Joshua in a professional boxing match that will air on Netflix. The card is set to begin at 8 p.m. ET, with the main event expected to start around 11:15 p.m. ET.\n\nThe entire event will be held at the Kaseya Center in Miami, with several high-profile celebrities expected to attend. While the fight has been marketed for months, Paul as the headliner makes it feel like the event will be even more over-the-top than a typical boxing event.\n\nPaul was initially supposed to fight Gervonta Davis, but the fight was cancelled because of Davis' serious domestic violence allegations. Paul was left without an opponent until Joshua's camp stepped in. Paul enters the fight with a 12-1-0 record, while Joshua is 28-4 in his professional boxing career.\n\nThis will undoubtedly be the biggest test of Paul's boxing career, with many believing that he won't make it past the third round without getting knocked out by the larger Joshua.\n\nHere is more on which celebrities are watching the Paul vs. Joshua fight on Friday night.\n\nMORE: How to watch the Paul vs. Joshua fight with Netflix\n\nAbsolute 1st class stuff from @netflix.

    "fullText": "Who will Jake Paul fight next? KSI, Terence Crawford among possible options for 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJake Paul has gone from fighting YouTubers and former NBA stars to facing Anthony Joshua, the former two-time unified heavyweight champion. It’s a feat even his biggest detractors have to respect.\n\nEven tough he lost, he’ll be bragging to the world he went toe-to-toe with Joshua and lived. That opens the door to endless opportunities in the sport.\n\nIf he doesn’t retire, which it doesn't look like he will, who would Paul fight next?\n\nRanked at cruiserweight, Paul will now also have made an impact at heavyweight. The possibilities are endless, from more abnormal fights to facing legitimate boxers.\n\nHe already topped the Mike Tyson fight by actually facing Joshua. How could he top this one?\n\nHere’s who Paul could potentially fight next.\n\nMORE: How good is Jake Paul really at boxing?\n\nFrom an entertainment perspective, one of the biggest fights for Paul is against KSI.\n\nKSI called out Jake and his brother Logan for a fight in 2018. Logan would fight him twice, but Jake was always there to add tension. Jake beat KSI's brother Deji, and the two have called one another out several times.\n\nVarious rules and weight requests over the years have brought the potential of a fight to a halt. KSI's relationship with now-business partner Logan may further complicate things.\n\nKSI and Misfits Boxing have had issues recently, with Andrew Tate taking over the promotion. KSI is technically available now. However, it could all be a ruse to lead to an eventual KSI-Tate fight.\n\nWith that as a factor, it’s unknown how close we will ever be to Jake vs. KSI. However, if booked, it would bring in a massive audience.\n\nConor McGregor is one of the most polarizing figures in combat sports, not named Jake Paul. Everyone still wants a piece of the Irish fighter, years after he reached his prime by boxing Floyd Mayweather in 2017.\n\nThough McGregor has gone through several legal issues and hasn't competed since 2021, there would still be interest in the fight. Paul called out McGregor after he faced Tyson, attempting to get something going against the \"Notorious\" one.\n\nMcGregor broke his tibia against Dustin Poirier in 2021. He was supposed to fight Michael Chandler, but that never came to fruition. McGregor is currently running things at BKFC and is rumored to fight at the White House in 2026.\n\nOne has to think UFC CEO Dana White wouldn’t allow Conor to fight Paul. But as we have seen, anything is possible.\n\nPer Paul, a fight against Terence Crawford was close to happening before the Joshua fight. He may try to book it again.\n\n\"It was very close to being Crawford instead of Joshua,\" Paul told ESPN. \"It really just came down to a timing thing and wanting to market a fight with Crawford properly.\n\n“Maybe we do it in 2026 and align the schedules because we were very close to making that fight happen. It's a massive fight, and when I beat Joshua it will be even bigger.\"\n\nThere may be some hiccups in the fight getting booked. Crawford recently announced his retirement following his massive win against Canelo Alvarez. Retirements never truly stick in the sport, and if the money is right, Crawford could return to fight Paul.\n\nThough Joshua may now face him, Jake could fight the man Joshua is scheduled to compete against in 2026: Tyson Fury.\n\nFury and Joshua have reportedly agreed to fight one another in 2026. First, they will compete in separate bouts to start the year. Something like this has been agreed upon before, but plans changed.\n\nFury is in the middle of his latest retirement. Jake called out the likes of Fury, Terence Crawford, Oleksandr Usyk, and others if he beat Joshua. The two do have history, as Jake lost to his half-brother Tommy.\n\nFury isn't one to say no to money, so a fight could be likely.\n\nSome forget that Jake Paul signed a contract with the PFL. He has yet to compete in an MMA fight, but he could against a multi-division undisputed champion, Oleksandr Usyk.\n\nThe two have faced off before, after Usyk beat Daniel Dubois in a rematch. Paul showed his respect but challenged Usyk to a cage fight. Usyk seemed interested, but only after he retires from boxing.\n\n\"Good plan, Jake Paul. But I’m not here for 5th place — only first. Soon, I'll close the book on boxing, and after that, I’ll be waiting for you in the cage. Let’s see if you’ve got the balls or just a hunger for hype,” Usyk said on social media.\n\nUsyk has plenty of challengers looking to fight him in the ring. After boxing, Jake could be next.",

    "description": "The OKC Thunder suffered a road loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. Here are three takeaways.",
    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS — The OKC Thunder fell short in a 112-107 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with a game-high 35 points to go along with seven assists and five rebounds in the loss. Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 26 points and 12 rebounds in his return from a three-game absence.\n\nOKC (25-3) has now lost two of its last three games. Next up is a home game against Memphis at 8:30 p.m. Monday.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the loss:\n\nOrder new book on Thunder's run to NBA title\n\nMUSSATTO: If the OKC Thunder is breaking your brain, you're not alone\n\nOKC has caused headaches for plenty of people around the NBA these past few seasons. That can happen when a team is dominant on both ends of the floor.\n\nBut few people around the league seem to get as irritable when facing the Thunder as Chris Finch. The Minnesota head coach voiced his frustrations after a win over OKC in Game 3 of last season's Western Conference finals.\n\n\"It's so frustrating to play this team because they foul a ton,\" Finch said. \"They really do. They foul. They foul all the time. And then you can't really touch Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander). It's a very frustrating thing, and it takes a lot of mental toughness to play through it.\"\n\nFinch wasn't able to coach through those frustrations on Friday.\n\nA foul wasn't called on Isaiah Hartenstein, who blocked Julius Randle's shot with 6:22 left in the first quarter. And a livid Finch received a technical foul before storming the court to confront the officials.\n\nAssistant coach Micah Nori managed to defuse the situation for a moment, convincing Finch to return to the bench. But Finch then exploded onto the court again, and this time it took four members of Minnesota's staff to hold him back.\n\nFinch received a second technical foul, resulting in his ejection. Nori stepped in during his absence.\n\nMore: Why Thunder's Isaiah Hartenstein always looks to 'give back' to OKC\n\nBones Hyland is as thin-framed as his nickname suggests, but that didn't stop him from trying to outmuscle OKC's bigs.\n\nAfter missing a free throw late in the third quarter, the 6-foot-2, 169-pound guard battled down low for his own offensive board. And after missing a putback shot, he harassed Hartenstein under the rim in a desperate attempt to get the ball back.\n\nThat pestering proved to be effective, as Hartenstein tried to throw the ball away but got it stolen by Hyland.\n\nThe Timberwolves scratched and clawed all night. They dominated on the glass, recording 18 offensive boards compared to the Thunder's 13, and they converted those second chances into 29 points. They also recorded eight steals.\n\nOKC matched that intensity down the stretch, recording five of its 13 offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter. But it wasn't enough to avoid the narrow loss.\n\nMore: Why Thunder guard Ajay Mitchell is no longer NBA's best-kept secret: 'He's cold'\n\nTwo of OKC's three losses this season have come on the second night of a back-to-back, and it'll have more of those tough stretches in the next few weeks.\n\nOKC will host Memphis on Monday before it faces San Antonio on the road Tuesday. It'll also have two home games against Philadelphia on Dec. 28 and 29.\n\nOKC will then face Phoenix on the road on Jan. 4 before hosting Charlotte on Jan. 5. That means six of its next 10 games will come in the form of back-to-backs.\n\nMore: Near full strength, OKC Thunder 'keeping things open' with starting lineup\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander has scored at least 20 points in 99 consecutive games. That ranks second all-time, only trailing Wilt Chamberlain (126 games).\n\nOKC was without Aaron Wiggins (right adductor soreness), Jaylin Williams (right heel bursitis), Thomas Sorber (right ACL surgery recovery), Nikola Topić (surgery recovery) and Chris Youngblood (G League two-way).\n\nMinneapolis native Chet Holmgren finished with 14 points and five rebounds in 25 minutes.\n\nJustin Martinez covers the Thunder and NBA for The Oklahoman.

    "fullText": "West Ham United travel to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday afternoon to face an in-form Manchester City side.\n\nThe Hammers arrive in Manchester on the back of a damaging 3-2 home defeat, a result that extended their winless run.\n\nWest Ham are rooted in the relegation zone heading into the festive period.\n\nThe Irons are now 18th in the table, three points adrift of safety, and defeat this weekend would guarantee they spend Christmas inside the bottom three.\n\nUnfortunately for Hammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo, he must prepare for one of the toughest fixtures in English football with a depleted squad and mounting pressure.\n\nSince the end of October, Man City have taken things up a notch.\n\nPep Guardiola‘s side have won 10 of their last 12 matches across all competitions and are back in the title race.\n\nCity extended their winning run to six games in mid-week by beating Brentford 2-0 to reach the EFL Cup semi-finals.\n\nThey sit just two points behind leaders Arsenal and could briefly move to the top with a victory before the Gunners face Everton later on Saturday.\n\nWest Ham, by contrast, are struggling for momentum.\n\nSince Nuno’s arrival, the Hammers have picked up just two wins from 11 Premier League games, with a five-match winless run keeping them entrenched in danger.\n\nHowever, there is some encouragement on the road for the East London side.\n\nWest Ham are unbeaten in their last three away league matches, drawing all three, and twice taking the lead before being pegged back.\n\nMan City are unbeaten in their last 19 Premier League meetings with West Ham (W16, D3), winning each of the last five while scoring at least three goals in every match.\n\nWest Ham have lost 15 of their last 16 Premier League away games against City, conceding two or more goals on 13 occasions.\n\nCity have won seven consecutive home league games since their defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and have collected more home points than any side since April.\n\nIf West Ham are to defy history, they will need discipline, structure, and no shortage of resilience.\n\nWest Ham will be without Aaron Wan-Bissaka and El Hadji Malick Diouf, both away on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Senegal and DR Congo.\n\nNiclas Fullkrug and Lukasz Fabianski are minor doubts and will be assessed closer to kick-off.\n\nNuno will likely stick to a back three against City. Kyle Walker-Peters, who brings ‘high quality’, is in contention to start at wing-back alongside 20-year-old Oliver Scarles.\n\nWalker-Peters has the unenviable job of curtailing the Premier League’s most unpredictable dribbler (Jeremy Doku).\n\nExpect to see Max Kilman in the starting XI alongside Konstantinos Mavropanos and Jean-Clair Todibo, shielding Alphonse Areola in goal.\n\nIn midfield, Soungoutou Magassa and Freddie Potts are expected to retain their places after starting against Aston Villa.\n\nMeanwhile, Matheus Fernandes continues in an advanced role alongside the underwhelming Lucas Paqueta.\n\nJarrod Bowen is expected to lead the line, with Callum Wilson likely to settle for a place on the bench.\n\nAlphonse Areola; Konstantinos Mavropanos, Jean-Clair Todibo, Max Kilman; Kyle Walker-Peters, Soungoutou Magassa, Freddie Potts, Oliver Scarles; Lucas Paqueta, Matheus Fernandes; Jarrod Bowen.",

    "description": "Nebraska hosts an extremely talented #5 Oklahoma State squad on Sunday at 1 p.m.",
    "fullText": "Nebraska passed its first test of the weekend with flying colors. Sixth-ranked Nebraska beat #16 North Carolina 27-9 on Friday night at the Devaney Sports Center.\n\nDominant dub.#ToughTogether | #GBR pic.twitter.com/OuAKXAUPys\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) December 20, 2025\n\nNebraska had three backups in the lineup, and those were the three losses on the night. All of Nebraska’s starters that wrestled against the Tar Heels won their matches.\n\nWith #5 Oklahoma State coming to town Sunday, let’s see how the Huskers did on Friday.\n\nThe dual started out at 157 pounds where Nebraska’s #6 Antrell Taylor took on redshirt freshman Laird Root.\n\nTaylor used his patented underhook to body lock for a first-period takedown late in the period before adding another takedown in the second period on a low shot — again late in the period for the ride-out.\n\nIn the third, Taylor turned things up by collecting a pair of takedowns for the 13-2 win via major decision — Taylor’s 59th career win.\n\n157 | Trelly gets us started with a major.\n\nNU 4\nUNC 0 pic.twitter.com/o8VmmyBpAx\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) December 20, 2025\n\nTaylor is now 9-2 on the year going into his meeting Sunday against #2 Landon Robideau of Oklahoma State.\n\nFacing yet another ranked opponent, Nebraska’s #13 LJ Araujo took on the undefeated #20 Bryce Hepner of North Carolina — Hepner transferred there from Ohio State.\n\nThis match had a ton of action with some incredible scrambles but not much scoring. After a scoreless first period, Araujo scored an escape to start the second period. Hepner then chose neutral in the third to avoid going under Araujo.\n\nAraujo shot in in the third and was in deep, but the sequence was stalemated when Hepner injured his knee. Choosing bottom after injury time, Araujo took a 2-0 lead when Hepner elected for a neutral start. Araujo then held off Hepner’s late flurry for the 2-0 win via decision.\n\nAraujo is now 9-1 on the year going into his matchup against Oklahoma State’s #2 LaDarion Lockett.\n\nIn what is becoming his M.O., Nebraska’s #7 Christopher Minto started slow before scoring in bunches late in the match.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period against North Carolina’s Collin Carrigan, Minto scored an escape and a pair of takedowns in the second to go up 7-1.\n\nIn the third, Minto started on top and was able to get a wrist for a tilt and four near-fall points. Minto then let Carrigan up and scored two more takedowns to go up 17-3. With the riding-time point, it should have been an 18-3 tech fall, but a penalty point on Minto for unsportsmanlike conduct made it a 17-3 major decision.\n\n174 | Tophy gets the 18-3 tech 💪\n\nHuskers on top 12-0. pic.twitter.com/VdVWaTNqVX\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) December 20, 2025\n\nWith the win, Minto is now 9-2 on the year with a match looming on Sunday against the Cowboys’ #6 Alex Facundo.\n\nGiving #9 Silas Allred a night off from making weight, Nebraska went with true freshman Ty Eise against North Carolina’s #22 Jake Dailey. Eise has previously been at 174 this season.\n\nA high-level recruit, Eise performed admirably while being slightly undersized in this match. After a scoreless first period, Eise gave up an escape, a takedown and two near-fall points falling behind 6-0.\n\nIn the third, Eise scored an escape before getting in on a low shot for a takedown, cutting the deficit to 6-4. Eise then cut Dailey before looking for the tying takedown, but he never found it. With the riding-time point, Dailey earned the 8-4 decision win to put North Carolina on the board.\n\nDespite the loss, I see this as the type of match that only makes a true freshman who’s redshirting get better — especially one who will likely be relied upon next season as a starter.\n\nIn another ranked matchup, Nebraska’s #15 Camden McDanel looked sharp in a 10-2 major decision over North Carolina’s #32 Robert Platt.\n\nMcDanel scored a takedown in each period on the way to the major, giving Nebraska the 16-3 lead at the midway point of the dual. In the third, McDanel secured the takedown with just three seconds left, earning his team the bonus point.\n\nNo. 12 Camden McDanel gets the last-second takedown 😤 @HuskerWrestling\n\nSubscribe/watch on B1G+ https://t.co/f6JY1FElYS pic.twitter.com/QvQKfNoiJW\n\n— Big Ten Wrestling (@B1GWrestling) December 20, 2025\n\nWith the win, McDanel is now 9-3 on the year going into his matchup on Sunday against Oklahoma State’s #7 Cody Merrill.\n\nAfter missing the Hustle in the Heartland, Nebraska’s #4 AJ Ferrari took the mat against freshman Mikey Calcagno of UNC.\n\nFerrari scored the first takedown of the match early in the first period before adding four near-fall points on a cross-wrist tilt, but Calcagno came to play, scoring a takedown of his own late in the period.\n\nFerrari went on to earn a reversal and ride-out in the second before scoring a third-period takedown that turned into the win via pinfall.\n\nBOOM 🧷☠️ pic.twitter.com/4cfspXOKoR\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) December 20, 2025\n\nWith the win, Ferrari is now 5-1 on the year going into Sunday’s tilt against #8 Konner Doucet.\n\nIn Nebraska’s ongoing competition at 125 pounds, sophomore Alan Koehler took the mat Friday against #28 Kysen Terukina.\n\nKoehler gave up a late takedown in the first period before each guy scored an escape point in the second and third periods, respectively. Koehler was unable to get in on his offense in the end, dropping the match 4-1.\n\nWith the loss, Koehler is now 9-8 on the year, while redshirt freshman Kael Lauridsen will get his chance against #8 Troy Spratley of Oklahoma — a returning NCAA finalist — on Sunday.\n\nIn a rematch of a close loss for #8 Jacob Van Dee last year, the Husker junior flipped the script in this one against #19 Ethan Oakley.\n\nVan Dee was able to score a first-period takedown before riding the period out for 1:19 in riding time. In the second, Oakley cut the lead with an escape.\n\nVan Dee was able to get an escape of his own in the third before holding Oakley off for the 5-1 win via decision.\n\n133 | Van Dee picks up his 50th career win with a 5-1 decision over No. 15 Oakley. pic.twitter.com/fHtBpoEgiR\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) December 20, 2025\n\nWith the win, Van Dee is now 8-1 on the year and 50-22 for his career going into Sunday’s matchup against #21 Ronnie Ramirez of Oklahoma State.\n\nIn another ranked matchup, Nebraska’s #3 Brock Hardy faced #18 Luke Simcox of North Carolina.\n\nHardy earned a first-period takedown and ride-out to go up 3-0 in the first period before adding an escape in the second. Hardy then started the third period on top and proceeded to ride the period out, securing the riding-time point and the 5-0 win.\n\nWith the win, Hardy is now 10-2 on the year and 96-26 for his career going into a premier matchup against Oklahoma State’s #2 Sergio Vega, the true freshman who beat Hardy by major at National Duals.\n\nIn the final match of the night, sophomore Scott Robertson took on talented freshman Nate Askew — a 2024 U17 World Team member for Team USA.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, Robertson struck first with an escape in the second — he then showed some solid defense in fending off a late Askew attack.\n\nIn the third, Askew eventually earned the escape, tying the match at 1-1 — these two eventually went to sudden victory where Askew was able to score a takedown on a re-shot for the 4-1 win over Robertson.\n\nWith the loss, Robertson falls to 0-4 on the year.\n\nStarting Sunday against Oklahoma State, #8 Chance Lamer will be eligible for the Huskers, so I would expect to see him in the dual lineup from here on out.\n\nLamer’s insertion in the lineup couldn’t come at a better time with Nebraska facing Oklahoma State’s #13 Casey Swiderski at this weight on Sunday. In a dual where every match will be crucial, a win here by Lamer in his Husker dual debut would be monumental — he’s currently 10-0 on the year in open tournaments with 35 takedowns scored and none given up.",

    "fullText": "Love him or hate him — Jake Paul knows how to draw a reaction out of people. Friday's latest sideshow fight was no different.\n\nIn a matchup that baffled the fight world, former two-time unified heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua made easy work of Paul, dropping the YouTuber-turned-pugilist four times en route to a brutal sixth-round knockout live on Netflix. Joshua was an overwhelming BetMGM favorite coming into the weekend for good reason — the Englishman, who stands 6-foot-6 with a monstrous 82-inch reach, towered over Paul in both stature and résumé, and he put those advantages to good use.\n\nAfter a slow start, Joshua battered Paul around the ring in a bizarre and lopsided fight that saw Paul repeatedly dive for Joshua's legs as if he was shooting an MMA-style double-leg takedown. Paul said afterward that he believed he suffered a broken jaw due to Joshua's powerful punches.\n\nNot surprisingly, given how high-profile Paul's fights have become, the sports world had plenty to say about six rounds it witnessed Friday.

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace travel to Elland Road on Saturday night looking to bounce back from last weekend’s defeat and maintain their push to play European football again.\n\nPalace were punished despite a strong performance in a 3-0 loss to Manchester City at Selhurst Park last week, a result that ended their three-game winning run.\n\nHowever, Oliver Glasner’s side remains firmly in the mix, sitting just two points off the top four and boasting one of the league’s strongest away records in 2025.\n\nWith Palace also juggling European commitments, rotation is expected, but Glasner has made it clear that his senior players will return for this trip to Yorkshire.\n\nElland Road has been a lively venue in recent weeks, with Leeds United scoring and conceding freely under Daniel Farke’s new 3-5-2 system.\n\nLeeds are unbeaten in three league matches and have shown renewed attacking zest, but their defensive structure still allows chances, something Palace will exploit.\n\nDespite the heavy loss, the Eagles generated close to two expected goals last weekend and remain one of the most dangerous transition sides in the division.\n\nGlasner’s decision to rest most of his first-choice XI in mid-week means Palace should arrive fresher than their schedule suggests.\n\nCrystal Palace have won more away Premier League games than any other side in 2025 (10), collecting a league-high 34 points on the road.\n\nThe Eagles have underperformed their expected goals by more than any team this season (-6.5). Their finishing needs to improve.\n\nMeanwhile, Leeds have scored and conceded in each of their last six home league games, netting multiple goals in four of those fixtures.\n\nPalace won 5-1 at Elland Road in their last top-flight visit and are looking to secure consecutive league wins away to Leeds for the first time.\n\nPalace are without Daichi Kamada after the midfielder suffered a serious hamstring injury.\n\nDaniel Munoz, Cheick Doucoure, Chadi Riad, Rio Cardines, and Caleb Kporha also remain sidelined.\n\nIsmaila Sarr is away on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Senegal, further limiting Glasner’s options in wide areas.\n\nHowever, the Austrian has confirmed that the players who did not start Thursday’s Conference League draw with KuPS will return to the XI, providing welcome continuity.\n\nDean Henderson will come back in goal, while Marc Guehi, Maxence Lacroix, and Chris Richards are all set for defensive recalls.\n\nThe ‘Outstanding’ Will Hughes is expected to partner with Adam Wharton in midfield.\n\nEddie Nketiah, 26, should start in support of Jean-Philippe Mateta alongside Yeremy Pino in place of Sarr.\n\nDean Henderson; Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix, Marc Guehi; Nathaniel Clyne, Adam Wharton, Will Hughes, Tyrick Mitchell; Eddie Nketiah, Yeremy Pino; Jean-Philippe Mateta.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Stars took a big lead and never let it go in a much-needed blowout 8-3 win against the Anaheim Ducks at Honda Center on Friday.\n\nThe Stars entered the game against Anaheim tonight with 14 healthy forwards and seven defensemen. You heard that right… 21 healthy skaters! That’s unheard of.\n\nSome of us joked last week that Stars coach Glen Gulutzan wouldn’t know how to run a practice with so many bodies. It’s a joke, but behind it is some truth. Dallas has been plastered with injuries this season.\n\nNow, they have gotten Jamie Benn, Matt Duchene, Thomas Harley, Nils Lundkvist, and Adam Erne back in the lineup after long absences. The Stars are now so healthy and deep, in fact, that they had to waive a solid 24-year-old defenseman. And so healthy that Nathan Bastian has been scratched seven straight games. Now Colin Blackwell is sitting with him in Anaheim because of the return of Erne.\n\nErne missed 18 games after knee surgery after making the team on a PTO out of training camp. He was also coming off the same hip surgery as Tyler Seguin, done by the same doctor… On the same day. Erne played in only 14 games before the injury, so we really don’t know what his ceiling is.\n\nAgainst the Ducks, Erne played 10:57 and even scored his third goal of the season when he found a loose puck in front. Erne now has more goals than Blackwell, Harley, and Radek Faksa, and is just one behind Sam Steel and Mavrik Bourque. I don’t know what his future is with this organization, but Erne has made a nice case as a big body who can play hard and add a few goals — What Steel and Bourque have struggled to do.\n\nOnly Seguin and Lian Bichsel are left on the injured list. Seguin had surgery on Tuesday to repair a torn ACL and is likely done for the season, although not officially yet. Bichsel’s timeline says he could return before or just after the Olympics.\n\nDallas was outshot early. They were outshot in the first period. They were outshot in the second period. They were outshot in the game. They took three penalties and only drew one until a double minor midway through the third when the game was out of hand. They started the night often in the wrong spots and wrong side of the puck, opening the ice for a back-and-forth game, which heavily favors the Ducks’ style and skill.\n\nBut then you looked up at the scoreboard toward the end of the first period and saw the Stars up 4-1. And up 7-1 after 40.\n\nAnaheim had opportunities to create offense with some open ice. Instead, they turned the puck over repeatedly and gave Dallas the time and space to find its game. And they did, as the Stars really started outskating Anaheim and continued to do so.\n\nDallas scored on its only power play through two periods and killed off all three opportunities for the Ducks. Anaheim struggled to even get shots off when up a man. And because the Ducks are at the top of the league in short-handed goals, of course, Dallas scored down a man in the first period.\n\nOh, and Lukáš Dostál helped the cause for the Stars with a whopping .333 save percentage and four goals against before getting pulled early in the game.\n\nJason Robertson’s night was the perfect example of how backward this game was. I was ready to write and talk about Robertson really struggling tonight. He had not recorded a point in three straight, and he started the game with a tripping penalty when he stopped his feet behind the Anaheim net. It was unnecessary and lazy, and it looked like he was going to have a tough game. He added another minor in a nearly identical situation in the second period.\n\nThen, he scored two consecutive highlight-reel goals in the second period, including on the power play. And all was well.\n\nJason Robertson, again. Oh my. pic.twitter.com/Lsenwlreed\n\n— Robert Tiffin (@RobertTiffin) December 20, 2025\n\nI had to double-check that the NHL’s Christmas break didn’t start tomorrow because this felt like a “going into break” type of game.\n\nThis was a point night for the Dallas Stars. But not the usual kind, as we mentioned before, Dallas was outshot for the entire game. They shot 50% to bust out to an 8-2 lead. 50 percent! Petr Mrázek didn’t do much to change the momentum, allowing five goals on the first nine shots he faced.\n\nIf you need to know just how offensive and wild this game was for Dallas, I can tell you that Ilya Lyubushkin not only scored, but sniped one top corner over the shoulder of Mrázek from the right circle. Does that lay things out pretty nicely for ya?\n\nIlya Lyubushkin was the last Dallas Skater on the roster not to have scored a goal this year. \n\nHe has now scored a goal this year. 8-2, and what a goal. pic.twitter.com/NYqJ0hOuS5\n\n— Robert Tiffin (@RobertTiffin) December 20, 2025\n\nDallas finished the night with eight goals. Robertson was the only one to double-dip, as Erne, Lyubushkin, Steel, Harley, Roope Hintz, and Oskar Bäck added goals. Steel scored a beauty on the rush just before being nearly decapitated by the post. Harley scored his second of the season with a beautiful shot down the right wing and finished the game plus-5.\n\nThe only Stars skaters not to record a point were Alex Petrovic (makes sense), Nils Lundkvist (yup), Matt Duchene (okay), and Wyatt Johnston (what?). Robertson led all skaters with three points.\n\nRobert Tiffin and I had this exact conversation this afternoon…\n\nThe great part about this blowout is that it allowed Dallas to roll four lines and three D pairs. I will never stop being worried about this team running out of gas late in the spring. They have done exactly that in three consecutive Western Conference Finals. That’s why I talk about getting Bastian back in, using extra defensemen, and playing Casey DeSmith as much as possible.\n\nThe schedule and fatigue are only going to get worse as many key players head to Milan for the Winter Olympics. The Stars have a good enough team to use their entire lineup. And in games like this, they can get away with Miro Heiskanen only playing 22:05 and not at all in the final 5:38, and Mikko Rantanen finishing with 16:03 time on ice.\n\nGulutzan made a conscious decision to let his big players sit down the stretch, not the first time he has done that.\n\nThat’s important and part of why Dallas could really use a few more lopsided wins.\n\nWith the win, Dallas moved to a franchise record 12-game point streak in the second game of back-to-backs. Most teams are just trying to be near 50 percent in those games. That’s wild.",

    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua knocked out Jake Paul in the sixth round of their heavyweight fight on Friday night.\n\nThe two-time heavyweight champion displayed why he is one of the sport's elite punchers when he dropped the fading Paul twice in the fifth round.\n\nSensing the YouTuber was finished, Joshua rocked him with a right uppercut early in the sixth. The native of England then floored Paul with a combination to the head.\n\nAlthough Paul (12-2) reached his feet again, Joshua (29-4, 26 KOs) finally crushed Paul's upset dream when he dropped him a fourth time with a right to the head. Referee Christopher Young counted Paul out at 1:31 of the round in front of a capacity crowd of 19,600 at the Kaseya Center.\n\nPrior to the fight, Joshua told CBS Sports that he would consider it \"a failure\" if the match went longer than one round.\n\nBut his post-match comments were more tempered.\n\n\"Jake Paul has done really well tonight,\" Joshua said, according to CBS Sports. \"I want to give him his props. He got up time and time again. It was difficult in there for him, but he kept trying to find a way. It takes a real man to do that.\"\n\nWith the victory, Joshua now can angle to reclaim the heavyweight title he lost against Oleksandr Usyk. Joshua also has talked about a long discussed match with countryman and former champion, Tyson Fury. However, Fury is currently retired following consecutive losses to Usyk in 2024.\n\nIt was Joshua's first bout since Daniel Dubois knocked him out in five rounds in September 2024.\n\nJoshua methodically established pace against Paul from the opening round as neither fighter engaged early. Midway through the round, Paul threw an overhand right that Joshua blocked with his glove. In the closing seconds, Joshua scored with a right to the head near the ropes.\n\nIn the second, Joshua began utilizing his 6-inch reach advantage by leading with a left jab.\n\nPaul scored with a short right to the head early in the fourth. Later in the round, Paul twice fell to the canvas awkwardly as he again attempted to cut distance during close exchanges\n\nPaul weighed 216 pounds and Joshua weighed 243 for the bout.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, President Trump said he watched the fight while flying back to Washington from a rally in North Carolina.\n\n\"On the plane I just got to watch the Jake Paul Fight, and he did really well, especially as a display of GREAT Courage against a very talented and large Anthony Joshua,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Fantastic Entertainment, but Kudos to Jake for his Stamina, and frankly, Ability, against a much bigger man!\"\n\nThe 28-year-old Paul, who began his career in January 2020, originally had targeted an exhibition in Miami with lightweight champion Gervonta Davis last month. But Davis encountered legal problems that scrapped the event. Paul quickly pivoted and landed the bout against Joshua in the same venue.\n\nCelebrities in the crowd included golf champion Rory McIlroy, New York Mets slugger Juan Soto, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy and retired NFL receivers Michael Irvin and Brandon Marshall.\n\nIn an undercard bout between retired UFC champions, 50-year-old Anderson Silva scored a second-round TKO against Tyron Woodley.\n\nPerson of interest identified in deadly Brown University shooting\n\nJohn Dickerson and Maurice DuBois sign off after their last \"CBS Evening News\" broadcast\n\nTrump administration official says only part of the Epstein files will be released today",

    "fullText": "Leeds United return to Elland Road on Saturday night, aiming to extend their Premier League unbeaten run to four matches as they welcome Crystal Palace to West Yorkshire.\n\nLeeds came from behind to secure a deserved 1-1 draw away at Brentford last weekend, continuing their recent upturn under Daniel Farke.\n\nThat point followed impressive performances against behemoths, and Leeds now sit 17th in the table.\n\nThey are three points clear of the relegation zone, with momentum in their favour.\n\nHowever, Farke knows his Leeds team will have to bring their A-game against this tricky Palace side in pursuit of European football.\n\nLeeds have enjoyed a revival since Farke’s switch to a 3-5-2 system, which has somehow made them more fluid and confident in the final third.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has been the chief beneficiary, scoring in four consecutive Premier League matches, the joint-longest active run in Europe’s top five leagues.\n\nLeeds have scored as many goals in their last five games as they managed in their previous 11 combined.\n\nElland Road has also become a more open, chaotic arena of late.\n\nLeeds have scored and conceded in each of their last six home league games, with end-to-end football becoming the norm.\n\nMeanwhile, Crystal Palace arrive fresh from a bruising 3-0 home defeat to Manchester City, a scoreline that flattered, given the Eagles generated enough chances to win.\n\nWastefulness proved costly, and Oliver Glasner’s side now face another quick turnaround following Thursday night’s Conference League draw with KuPS.\n\nPalace remain fifth in the table, just two points off the top four, but their domestic form immediately after European fixtures has been a recurring concern.\n\nLeeds have taken five points from their last three league games, a run that included Chelsea, Liverpool, and Brentford.\n\nOn the other hand, Palace have failed to win any of their five league matches played directly after a Conference League fixture this season (D1, L4).\n\nHowever, Palace will take solace from their record against Leeds, having beaten the hosts in their last two league meetings.\n\nThe Eagles haven’t lost to Leeds since 2021.\n\nThe Whites and the Eagles have faced off 52 times, with Leeds winning 24 and drawing 13 of those matches, dating back to a League Cup encounter in 1962.\n\nCrystal Palace have won 10 league games on the road in 2025, the highest number of any Premier League club.\n\nBut Leeds’ home form will inspire confidence, having collected three-quarters of their Premier League points tally at Elland Road, 12 of 16.\n\nLeeds will have to work to break Palace, though. Only league leaders Arsenal (10) have conceded fewer league goals than the Eagles (15) this season.\n\nThe home team will again be without the ‘excellent’ Lukas Nmecha, who has been ruled out with a hamstring issue despite fans hoping for a return.\n\nSean Longstaff and Daniel James also remain sidelined, leaving Farke with an unchanged pool of options.\n\nWith Nmecha unavailable, Noah Okafor is expected to continue alongside Calvert-Lewin in attack, despite missing chances at Brentford.\n\nItalian international Wilfried Gnonto (13 caps) is likely to remain among the substitutes, as the current system favours wing-backs over traditional wingers.\n\nThe midfield trio of Anton Stach, Ethan Ampadu, and Ao Tanaka should be retained, while Jayden Bogle and Gabriel Gudmundsson continue in the wing-back roles.\n\nThe back three of Pascal Struijk, Jaka Bijol, and Joe Rodon is also set to remain intact in front of Lucas Perri.\n\nCrystal Palace are stretched defensively. Daichi Kamada, Daniel Munoz, Cheick Doucoure, Chadi Riad, Rio Cardines, and Caleb Kporha are all unavailable.\n\nIsmaila Sarr is away on Africa Cup of Nations duty.\n\nLucas Perri; Joe Rodon, Jaka Bijol, Pascal Struijk; Jayden Bogle, Anton Stach, Ethan Ampadu, Ao Tanaka, Gabriel Gudmundsson; Noah Okafor, Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",

That was the request and it was on my mind.\n\n“It took longer than expected. Now, Jake Paul has done really well tonight. I’ll give him his props. He got up, time and time again.\n\n“It was difficult for me in there. We give them their respect, he tried and tried, but he came up against a real fighter in there.\n\n“I had a 15 month layoff, we shook off the cobwebs. If Tyson is as serious as he thinks he is, if he wants to put down his Twitter fingers and put on some gloves, and come and fight in the ring, take a challenge, step in the ring with me next if you’re a real bad boy, don’t give all that talking, AJ this, AJ that, let’s see you in the ring and talk with your fists.”\n\nWhile Paul detailed the damage suffered at the hands of the former world champion.\n\n“That was crazy, I had a blast, I’m blessed by God to put on a performance like this. Anthony is a great fighter, I got my arse beat. But I’ll come back and keep winning,” Paul said.\n\n“I’ve already won in every single way in life, my family, my jaw is broken by the way, it’s definitely broke, nice little arse whooping from one of the best to ever do it.\n\n“Honestly, I’m not surprised, I just got tired, so much handling his weight, I think with better cardio, I could’ve kept fighting. I did my personal best.\n\n“Oh, for sure, we’ll heel the broken jaw, go back, fight people my own weight and go for the cruiserweight world title.”",

    "fullText": "The NBA Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder suffered just their third defeat of the season Friday, in a last-minute 112-107 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nA whopping 35 points from reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander wasn't enough to prevent the reverse -- the previously imperious Thunder's second in their past three games.\n\nAnthony Edwards top-scored for the Timberwolves, earning 26 points, plus 12 rebounds, three assists and two blocks.\n\nThe NBA champion Thunder had held the lead with 40 seconds left on the clock, before an Edwards 24-foot three-point step back jumpshot gave the Timberwolves the decisive advantage.\n\n\"It was a close game, it could have gone either way. We've played a lot of these games this season. We've won a lot of them,\" said Thunder coach Mark Daigneault.\n\n\"We had a lead going into the closing possessions, and then they just made a couple more plays than we did,\" he told reporters after.\n\nThe loss leaves the Thunder at 25-3, and comes just days after their elimination from the NBA Cup semi-final in Las Vegas by the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nOklahoma City had been on a 16-game winning streak that prompted talk of them breaking Golden State's record 73-win season.\n\nAlso on Friday, the San Antonio Spurs crushed the Atlanta Hawks 126-98, with French NBA superstar Victor Wembanyama coming off the bench to score 26 points in just 21 minutes.\n\nHis time still being managed since returning from injury, Wembanyama also managed 12 rebounds, three assists, two blocks -- and a spectacular one-handed alley-oop dunk.\n\nThe Spurs' win follows their own disappointment of defeat in the NBA Cup final in Las Vegas Tuesday by the New York Knicks.\n\nVictory takes the Spurs to third in the Western Conference, on 20-7.\n\nIt was Wembanyama's 100th game in a row making at least one block, a streak achieved only twice before in NBA history -- Dikembe Mutombo (116) and Patrick Ewing (145).\n\nThe 7ft 4in (2.24m) prodigy, 21, had missed a dozen Spurs games after suffering a left calf strain last month.\n\nThe Knicks' seven-game winning streak came to an end with a 116-107 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden.\n\nTyrese Maxey led the scoring, with 30 points, nine rebounds and two assists.\n\nThe Boston Celtics beat the Miami Heat 129-116, with Jaylen Brown reaching 30 points for a sixth consecutive game.",

    "fullText": "Anthony Edwards credits Chris Finch's ejection in the Timberwolves' win over the Thunder originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nChris Finch became the biggest story of the night early in the blockbuster matchup between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Oklahoma City Thunder with his ejection.\n\nHowever, it looks like the Timberwolves used that to fuel the flame to get the 112-107 win. That was only the Thunder's third loss of the season, putting the Timberwolves in a special group alongside the Portland Trail Blazers and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe Timberwolves have had a decent season so far, but this win over the Thunder has to be their biggest of the season. Beating the defending champions is always a big achievement, but doing it without the head coach for most of the game is impressive.\n\nFinch made sure to voice out his frustrations at the referee after a blown call early in the first quarter. By that time, the Thunder led 15-11, but the Timberwolves fed off of Finch's energy to win the game.\n\nMore: Timberwolves' Chris Finch nearly lost his mind after ejection\n\nTimberwolves star Anthony Edwards had a solid performance, getting 26 points and 12 rebounds to spearhead his team to victory. After the game, Edwards made sure to credit Finch for spurring the Timberwolves on to get the victory.\n\n\"We fed off Finchy's energy. That's all it was. Was that the first time you got thrown out, Finchy? Hell yeah,\" Edwards said in the dugout immediately after the win.\n\nReigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a strong performance of 36 points, five rebounds, and seven assists, but that was not enough to overcome the surging Timberwolves.\n\nThis could be a landmark moment for the Timberwolves' season, as they want to keep getting big wins like that. Finch's passion for his team was evident, and the players responded in kind.\n\nFor the Thunder, this is a small stumble, but it can be a bit worrying to suffer two losses in a week. They are still the NBA's best team, but these stumbles are showing some cracks. They will likely bounce back strong, but teams are starting to figure them out.",

    "description": "YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul repeatedly dove at the legs of the former world heavyweight champion, seemingly trying to delay the inevitable: a knockout, which finally came in round six",
    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua stopped Jake Paul in their boxing match on Friday, knocking down the YouTuber multiple times en route to a sixth-round win.\n\nJoshua, a former two-time world heavyweight champion, faced Paul in a professional heavyweight contest in Miami, meaning knockouts were allowed – despite many fans questioning the legitimacy of the fight.\n\n• Follow live: Joshua vs Paul fallout after Briton stops YouTuber in six rounds\n\nBut there was no debate about the legitimacy come round six, as Joshua scored a fourth and final knockdown, sending an exhausted Paul to his knees in the corner of the ring.\n\nPaul, 28, had beaten the referee’s count on three previous occasions but could not this time, as he was counted out and beaten for the second time in his pro career. Meanwhile, Joshua bounced back from his stoppage defeat by Daniel Dubois in 2024 by securing victory in the Kaseya Center.\n\nStill, it took the 36-year-old some time to produce a knockdown or any meaningful offence at all. Paul spent much of the early rounds skipping away from the Briton in a larger-than-usual ring, with “AJ” struggling to pin down the American.\n\nBoos rained down as the fight progressed, with Paul repeatedly diving at Joshua’s legs, perhaps in a bid to avoid damage and buy time. Yet when Joshua did trap Paul against the ropes, he would often overshoot with right hands, failing to locate the head of the shorter, evasive man.\n\nPaul even taunted Joshua by sticking out his tongue at the former world champion, and the YouTuber even produced noteworthy moments with occasional jabs and hooks landing on AJ.\n\nBefore the fight, the fourth round was marked out by many fans and pundits as pivotal; if Joshua could not stop Paul before the end of that frame, he would have failed, many said. At this point, statistics showed how little each man had thrown and also how little they had landed.\n\nPaul was warned by the referee for his repeated attempts to grab Joshua’s legs, as the American tried to drag Joshua down with him more than once. At one point, Paul alleged he had been the victim of a low blow and was given time to recover, with the 28-year-old taking about a minute of it – having actually hit his groin on Joshua’s knee while stumbling to the canvas.\n\n“The fans did not pay to see this crap,” the referee warned both fighters, but the fans soon got what they did pay to see.\n\nAn uppercut hurt Paul in the fifth round, as Joshua landed his best shot of the fight, leading the YouTuber to collapse to his knees to buy time yet again. Still no knockdown was ruled, but in the ensuing moments, Paul was visibly tired and less mobile than before. Joshua punished him with body shots, and Paul appeared to tweak his leg while retreating.\n\nJoshua hurt Paul again and was finally awarded a knockdown, before scoring a second by spearing a right cross onto the chin of Paul, who just survived to the bell.\n\nJoshua floored a cornered Paul with a piston right cross in the sixth frame, and Paul, to his credit, managed to keep fighting. He even taunted Joshua again, sticking out his tongue at AJ, who continued to stalk the influencer before crumpling him in the corner for a fourth knockdown.\n\nThis time, Paul was unable to rise in time, marking the end of the controversial fight and sending the fans into raptures.\n\n“I appreciate everyone in this venue,” Joshua said after the fight. “It wasn’t the best performance. The end goal was to get him, pin him down and hurt him. That’s what people wanted, that was on my mind. It took longer than expected.\n\n“Now, Jake Paul has done really well tonight. He got up, time and time again. It was difficult for me in there. We give them their respect, he tried and tried, but he came up against a real fighter in there.\n\n“I saw Eddie [Hearn, promoter] saying: ‘Get him now!’ I said I’d take his soul, see it leaving his body round after round. I said it, and it happened. I understand the psychology of fighting.”\n\nJoshua also addressed critics of his decision to take this fight, saying: “I don’t care about legacy, it lasts about 50 years, then it’s done. This is what I decided to do. I will do it until I can’t no more. All we can do is give my best.”\n\nHe also addressed compatriot Tyson Fury, with whom he has long been linked, saying: “If Tyson is as serious as he says he is, if he wants to put on some gloves, take a challenge... Don’t give all that talking, ‘AJ this, AJ that.’ Let’s see you talk with your fists.”\n\nPaul added: “That was crazy, I had a blast, I’m blessed by God to put on a performance like this. Anthony is a great fighter, I got my arse beat. But I’ll come back and keep winning.\n\n“I’ve already won in every single way in life, my family, my beautiful fiancee... My jaw is broken by the way, it’s definitely broke, nice little arse-whooping from one of the best to ever do it.”\n\nPaul, who spat out blood during his in-ring interview, continued: “Honestly, I’m not surprised; I just got tired, so much handling his weight. I think with better cardio, I could’ve kept fighting. I did my personal best. For sure, we’ll heal the broken jaw, go back, fight people my own weight and go for the cruiserweight world title.”\n\nFriday’s fight took place 13 months after Paul outpointed a 58-year-old Mike Tyson, a legend of heavyweight boxing, and six months after he beat former middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr on points.\n\nPreviously, Paul had only been beaten by Tommy Fury – half-brother of Tyson – who beat the YouTuber via decision in 2023.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile it took longer than many expected, Friday night’s “Judgment Day” in Miami ended exactly as the boxing world anticipated: Anthony Joshua delivered a devastating knockout of Jake Paul at the Kaseya Center.\n\nThe former two-time unified heavyweight champion closed the fight at 1:31 of the sixth round, landing a final, brutal right hand that sent the social media star crashing to the canvas for the second time in the round, ending Paul’s consciousness and his undefeated streak.\n\nJoshua methodically dismantled a surprisingly resilient and elusive Paul, proving that elite boxing pedigree ultimately prevails over crossover hype at the highest levels of the sport. The knockout was so decisive that Paul later revealed his jaw had been broken by the concussive blow.\n\nMORE: Anthony Joshua knocks out Jake Paul in sixth round\n\nJoshua finally got to Paul in the sixth round, delivering the crushing knockout blow.\n\nJAKE PAUL KO COURTESY OF ANTHONY JOSHUA 🥊🥊\n\nLIVE only on @netflix | #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/wjyyBn3NdN\n\n— @Sports is watching Jake vs Joshua LIVE on Netflix (@Sports) December 20, 2025\n\nAfter the fight, Paul — who took his fair share of shots throughout the night — told Ariel Helwani that Joshua broke his jaw.\n\nJake Paul after getting KOd by Anthony Joshua: \"I think my jaw is broken.\" 😭 #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/gVexEqR4sq\n\n— Netflix Sports (@netflixsports) December 20, 2025\n\n\"I think my jaw is broken by the way,\" Paul said as he spat out blood. \"It's definitely broke.

However, a full return to normal activity — especially for a contact athlete like a boxer — takes longer.\n\nTo safely handle the high-impact stress of sparring and competition, medical professionals typically recommend waiting four to six months for complete structural strengthening and healing. While initial healing occurs relatively quickly, a conservative return to competitive boxing is realistically projected to take at least six months.\n\nMORE: Celebrities who showed up for Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua\n\nIn his post-fight interview, Jake Paul stated he is ready to take a break after six years of fighting. This aligns with the necessity of healing an injury; the alleged broken jaw he sustained will force him out of the ring for an estimated four to six months for proper bone and structural recovery.\n\nJake Paul after being knocked out by Anthony Joshua 😳 pic.twitter.com/XRel65fTId\n\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) December 20, 2025\n\nDespite the defeat, Paul reaffirmed his primary goal, saying, \"I'm going to come back and get a world championship belt at some point.\" This ambition suggests he will return to the Cruiserweight division, where he has primarily competed and where he is currently ranked, rather than continuing to campaign at the heavyweight limit he faced against Joshua.\n\nMay very well be the exact moment where Jake Paul's jaw was broken by Anthony Joshua 😮‍💨\n\n(📸 via Giorgio Viera / AFP via Getty Images) pic.twitter.com/620Z6JXwrv\n\n— DraftKings (@DraftKings) December 20, 2025\n\nAs this was a professional knockout loss, the Florida Athletic Commission will impose a mandatory minimum rest period, which is at least seven days, but for a knockout, it is often a 60-day medical suspension or longer, depending on the severity of the blow.\n\nOnce he is fully recovered and cleared, his options include facing a Cruiserweight contender or doing crossover fights similar to what he's done in the past.\n\nMORE: Who will Jake Paul fight next?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAnthony Joshua and Jake Paul duked it out on Netflix on Friday night.\n\nJoshua filled in for Gervonta Davis, who was initially booked to take on Paul. The fight was easy to market, with Joshua having legitimate boxing experience while Paul is better known for his social media presence.\n\nJoshua weighed in about 30 pounds heavier than Paul, and the two would usually be in different weight classes. The fact that they were even boxing was already suspect, and many, including every single person on the pre-fight panel, thought the fight would be over before the end of the third round.\n\nPaul danced around the ring for a couple of rounds and continually went to his knees, almost like he was going to go for a UFC-style takedown. The fight went into the sixth round, and many lost interest in how long it was taking Joshua to win and the product being shown.\n\nJoshua finally put Paul away in the sixth round, but that didn't stop fans from calling into question the legitimacy of the fight.\n\nHere is more on how the highly anticipated boxing match between Joshua and Paul ended.\n\nMORE: How did Sporting News score the Jake Paul-Anthony Joshua fight?\n\nThe public will likely never know for certain whether the fight between Joshua and Paul was staged. The recent trend in boxing has seen many social media stars and former boxers putting on outrageous fights, and the outcomes of some of them certainly make it look like foul play is involved.\n\nPaul planned to run away from Joshua and hoped to land a knockout blow. As he ran away from Joshua and repeatedly fell to his knees, many on social media not only called into question the legitimacy of the fight, but also quickly called it one of the worst in recent memory.\n\nJoshua said he knew he needed to take some time to wear down Paul, but once he didn't knock out his opponent in the first or second round, the internet determined the fight must be scripted.\n\nMORE: Which celebrities attended the Jake Paul-Anthony Joshua fight?\n\nThe exact number hasn't been confirmed. Reports ahead of the fight suggested that Joshua and Paul would get paid $184 million, making $92 million apiece.\n\nPaul took to his Twitter account and wrote, \"Stop asking me. $267 million.\" While he never expanded on the message, many assumed that this would mean that the total purse was actually $267 million, with each fighter presumably taking home $133 million each.\n\nJake Paul for no reason #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/OkUwtE1CBG\n\n— Ron (@Ronhotspur) December 20, 2025\n\n“THE FANS DIDN’T PAY TO SEE THIS CRAP.”\n\nSays the official of the match. #Jakejoshua\n\npic.twitter.com/ceypDh9djg\n\n— Lavish Sports (@LAVISHSPORTSORG) December 20, 2025\n\nMe after betting Joshua to win by KO in round 1 (he threw 1 punch total) pic.twitter.com/w9RzVvqRtT\n\n— br_betting (@br_betting) December 20, 2025\n\nJake Paul took Anthony Joshua down 😂pic.twitter.com/dgZlAD4dKg\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) December 20, 2025\n\nJake Paul doing something *slightly* decent, followed by one of these#JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/aRKxZWafnL\n\n— Alex Wallace (@AlexWTalks) December 20, 2025\n\nAnthony Joshua not knocking out Jake Paul in the first round gave it away that this was scripted #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/j5C5DBai8B\n\n— SWB 🌟 (@29xSWB) December 20, 2025\n\nJake Paul keeps rolling around on the ground like that australian breakdancer #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/ptAPOMbylu\n\n— ♡ｌａｕｒｅｎ ♡ (@laurennfarmerr) December 20, 2025\n\nSo Jake Paul sticking his tongue out was the sign for Anthony Joshua to end the fight?

    "fullText": "British heavyweight Anthony Joshua needed six rounds to stop boxing novice Jake Paul, who spent much of the contest in survival mode in one of the most striking mismatches in the sport's history.\n\nJoshua, a two-time world champion, cut an increasingly frustrated figure as Paul danced around the ring for long spells, refusing to engage, before Joshua finally imposed himself by knocking down the YouTuber-turned-boxer twice in the fifth round.\n\nPaul was down again in the sixth, before Joshua landed a powerful and clean right hand that brought a surreal night to an abrupt conclusion at Miami's Kaseya Center.\n\nThe American did not beat the count, although there was palpable relief inside the arena when he was able to rise to his feet and leave the ring without assistance.\n\n\"It wasn't the best performance,\" Joshua, 36, said.\n\n\"The end goal was to pin Jake Paul down and hurt him. It took a bit longer than expected, but the right hand finally found the destination.\"\n\nIt was the result the boxing world had overwhelmingly predicted, and the controversial bout raises questions about the safety risks created by such a vast gulf in experience, size and power.\n\nJoshua claimed the 29th victory of his professional career in 33 outings and can now turn his attention to a legitimate challenge - notably the long-mooted showdown with Tyson Fury next year.\n\n\"Come and fight one of the realest fighters out there, step into there with me next if you're a really bad boy,\" Joshua told his rival.\n\nPaul, meanwhile, failed to deliver on his promise to pull off the greatest upset in sporting history.\n\nThe 28-year-old did manage to land a handful of shots, however, and the fact the contest stretched into the sixth round was an unflattering reflection on Joshua.\n\n'I will take break' - reaction to Joshua win as Paul plans boxing hiatus\n\nDubois drops & outclasses Panatta to retain WBC title\n\nJoshua walked to the ring first and received a mixed reception inside the 20,000-seat arena. His expression was stern, reflecting his insistence all week that he would treat the contest seriously.\n\nPaul's ringwalk raised eyebrows as he was flanked by rapper 6ix9ine, a controversial figure with a history of criminal convictions and prison time.\n\nWhen the opening bell rang, Paul circled on the back foot and boos soon followed.\n\nJoshua stalked him, swinging heavy lefts and rights that cut only air, with each miss drawing gasps from the crowd. Paul responded by sticking out his tongue, playing to the theatre.\n\nEvery passing minute felt like a small victory for Paul, who just 13 months earlier fought 58-year-old Mike Tyson.\n\nHe did land a looping overhand right in the fourth, but it barely registered with Joshua.\n\nThe event was broadcast live to more than 300 million Netflix subscribers.\n\nGolf superstar Rory McIlroy, fresh from his Sports Personality of the Year win, sat ringside alongside rappers Rick Ross and Timbaland.\n\nThe fifth round delivered what many had expected far earlier. A right hook brushed Paul's shoulder and sent him to the canvas.\n\nMoments later, a combination dropped him again. He rose heavily and was breathing hard as he attempted to mask the damage with bravado.\n\nAnother heavy right in the sixth sent Paul sprawling once more, prompting calls from sections of the crowd for the referee to step in.\n\nThose who remembered Joshua's brutal one-punch knockout of former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou earlier last year sensed a familiar ending approaching.\n\nIt was not quite as savage, but the straight right - the punch Joshua had been waiting for all night - finally landed flush.\n\nThis was not a contest designed to rigorously test Joshua's boxing ability. It was entertainment, engineered to generate attention and revenue.\n\n\"I don't care about the legacy. All the legacy is there to just last for 50 years, then it's done. This is what I do, I'll do it until can't any more,\" Joshua said.\n\nJoshua leaves Miami with his share of a reported purse of £210m.\n\nHis focus is now expected to shift to another warm-up opponent in February before a potential showdown with Fury later in 2026.\n\nPaul, meanwhile, admitted he \"got beat up\" but insisted he will come back and target a cruiserweight world title.\n\n\"I think my jaw is broken. That was good, I'll come back and get a world championship belt at some point,\" he said.\n\nLike him or loathe him, Paul draws audiences, headlines and debate in a way few boxers can.\n\nThe fact he convinced sections of the public that this fight might be competitive speaks volumes about his power as a promoter - even if as a boxer, he was found out.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrade talks surrounding the Los Angeles Lakers are heating up, and the Lakers appear to be in pursuit of a veteran forward.\n\nAccording to Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, the Lakers are pursuing New Orleans Pelicans wing Herb Jones.\n\n“The Los Angeles Lakers are monitoring the trade market for a defensive wing upgrade, league sources told HoopsHype. Among the 3-and-D wing upgrades on their wish list is New Orleans Pelicans forward Herb Jones, league sources say.”\n\nJones is widely considered one of the NBA’s top defenders. He’s averaged 1.6 steals and 0.7 blocks during his five NBA seasons. He would give the Lakers an aggressive defender who can match up with guards at the point of attack.\n\nJones has been a key member of the Pelicans’ rotation since his rookie year in 2021. He’s averaging 10.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and shooting 40.3% from the field this season. He’s also been a reliable 3-point shooter, shooting 33.7% this season and 36.2% for his career.\n\nHe only played 20 games last season due to a posterior labrum tear in his right shoulder. He’s already matched that total this season but missed around a week in November with a calf strain.\n\nJones is set to make $13.9 million this season and signed a three-year, $67.58M extension with the Pelicans last summer. The Lakers have limited future draft picks and cap space. Their 2031 unprotected first round pick could be enticing to the Pelicans, who could look to retool their roster around their rookies.",

    "title": "The Deviancy Signal: Having \"Nothing to Hide\" Is a Threat to Us All",
    "description": "A sharp indictment of the “nothing to hide” mindset and its role in building the very surveillance state that will one day turn against you.",
    "fullText": "There's a special kind of contempt I reserve for the person who says, \"I have nothing to hide.\" It's not the gentle pity you'd have for the naive. It's the cold, hard anger you hold for a collaborator. Because these people aren't just surrendering their own liberty. They're instead actively forging the chains for the rest of us. They are a threat, and I think it's time they were told so.\n\nTheir argument is a \"pathology of the present tense,\" a failure of imagination so profound it borders on a moral crime. What they fail to understand is that by living as an open book, they are creating the most dangerous weapon imaginable: a baseline of \"normalcy.\" They are steadily creating a data profile for the State's machine, teaching its algorithms what a \"good, transparent citizen\" looks like. Every unencrypted text, every thoughtless search, every location-tagged post is another brick in the wall of their own cage.\n\nAnd then comes the part they can't (or won't) fathom. The context shifts. The political winds change. The Overton window slams shut on a belief they once held. A book they read is declared subversive. A group they donated to is re-classified as extremist. A joke they told is now evidence of a thoughtcrime. Suddenly, for the first time, they have something to hide.\n\nSo they reach for the tools of privacy. They download the encrypted messenger. They fire up the VPN. They start to cover their tracks.\n\nAnd in that single act, they trigger the Deviancy Signal.\n\nTheir first attempt at privacy, set against their own self-created history of total transparency, is a screaming alarm to the grown surveillance machine. It's the poker player with a perfect tell, or the nocturnal animal suddenly walking in daylight. Their very attempt to become private is the most public and suspicious act they could possibly commit. They have not built an effective shield, as they have painted a target on their own back. By the time they need privacy, their own history has made seeking it an admission of guilt.\n\nBut the damage doesn't end with your own self-incrimination. It radiates outward, undoing the careful work of everyone around you. Think of your friend who has practiced perfect operational security, who has spent years building a private life to ensure they have no baseline for the state to analyze. They are a ghost in the machine. Then they talk to you. Your unshielded phone becomes the listening device they never consented to. You take their disciplined effort to stay invisible and you shout it into a government microphone, tying their identity to yours in a permanent, searchable log. You don't just contrast with their diligence; you actively dismantle it.\n\nOn a societal scale, this inaction becomes a collective betrayal. The power of the Deviancy Signal is directly proportional to the number of people who live transparently. Every person who refuses to practice privacy adds another gallon of clean, clear water to the state's pool, making any ripple of dissent ... any deviation ... starkly visible. This is not a passive choice. By refusing to help create a chaotic, noisy baseline of universal privacy, you are actively making the system more effective. You are failing to do your part to make the baseline all deviant, and in doing so, you make us all more vulnerable.\n\nThere is only one way to disarm this weapon: we must destroy its premise. We must obliterate the baseline. The task is not merely to hide, but to make privacy the default, to make encryption a reflex, to make anonymity a universal right. We must create so much noise that a signal is impossible to find. Our collective goal must be to make a \"normal\" profile so rare that the watchers have nothing to compare us to. We must all become deviations.",

    "title": "Trump Announces Pricing Deals with Nine Drugmakers",
    "description": "The companies were the latest to agree to sell drugs to Medicaid and directly to consumers at discounted prices. President Trump said he would soon begin similar negotiations with health insurers.",
    "fullText": "President Trump on Friday announced deals with nine pharmaceutical companies to reduce some drug prices, the latest step in his bid to try to align U.S. costs with the lower drug prices in European countries.\n\nMr. Trump has now reached deals with 14 of the 17 drugmakers to which he sent letters in July demanding that they lower prices. The nine companies participating in Friday’s announcement were Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.\n\nDrugmakers have been eager to strike deals with the administration in hopes of avoiding punitive regulatory action that could cut deeply into their profits. Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.\n\nIn a White House briefing announcing the deals, Mr. Trump and top health officials framed the agreements as part of a focus on affordability at a time when the administration is facing intense scrutiny for not doing more to stem rising prices.\n\nThe announcements were made as health insurance subsidies in the Obamacare marketplace were set to expire at the end of the year, which will likely to drive up premiums for millions of Americans.\n\nStanding at the podium, the president also took the opportunity to threaten the health insurance industry. Mr. Trump said he would call insurance executives to Florida or the White House soon to discuss lowering premiums.\n\n“They have to make less, a lot less,” he said. Stocks of major insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, CVS and Cigna, fell after Mr. Trump’s remarks.\n\n“Health plans are doing everything in their power to shield Americans from the high and rising costs of medical care, and we welcome any opportunity to discuss common-sense solutions to lower costs for everyone,” said Mike Tuffin, chief executive of AHIP, a major trade group for health insurance plans.\n\nUnder the deals announced on Friday, manufacturers will offer some of their drugs through websites where Americans can bypass insurance and use their own money to buy certain products. The offerings have focused on drugs often prescribed by primary care doctors rather than more specialized, expensive treatments for conditions like cancer.\n\nTo help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the drugmakers’ own websites. Officials put up a promotional version of the TrumpRx website this fall and said they plan for it to be operational in January.\n\nDrugs that will be made available in this way include Amgen’s Repatha, for lowering cholesterol, at $239 a month; GSK’s asthma inhaler, Advair Diskus, at $89 a month; and Merck’s diabetes medication Januvia, at $100 a month.\n\nMany of these drugs are nearing the end of their patent protection, meaning that the arrival of low-cost generic competition would soon have prompted manufacturers to lower their prices.\n\nIn other cases, the direct-buy offerings are very expensive and out of reach for most Americans.\n\nFor example, Gilead will offer Epclusa, a three-month regimen of pills that cures hepatitis C, for $2,492 a month on the site. Most patients pay far less using insurance or with help from patient assistance programs. Gilead says on its website that “typically a person taking Epclusa pays between $0 and $5 per month” with commercial insurance or Medicare.\n\nThe drugmakers also said they would introduce new medicines in the United States at prices comparable to what they ask other wealthy countries to pay.\n\nAnd the companies agreed to sell most of their products to state Medicaid programs, which provide health insurance for low-income Americans, at the prices they offer to other wealthy countries.\n\nPeople on Medicaid already pay nothing or very little in out-of-pocket costs. Federal law caps those costs at $8 per prescription for people with the lowest incomes.\n\nMedicaid is already legally required to get the lowest drug prices in the United States, which are often comparable to those in European countries.\n\nStill, administration officials said the deals would bring significant savings for some drug purchases. Bristol Myers Squibb said it would provide Eliquis, a widely used blood thinner, to Medicaid for free.\n\nA new, lower price for Medicare of $231 per month, enabled by a Biden-era law, will go into effect in January. Medicaid’s current prices for Eliquis are not public, and Bristol Myers Squibb did not return a request for comment on what it now charges Medicaid programs.\n\n“It’s very likely that Medicaid programs were already getting it for free or close to free,” said Dr. Benjamin Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nAs he has done while announcing the other drug pricing deals, Mr. Trump on Friday made claims about impossible price decreases of up to 800 percent. At another point, he boasted: “This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care by far.”\n\nAt least initially, most Americans won’t see changes to their out-of-pocket costs resulting from the deals. In some cases, they could end up paying more if they use their own money to go through TrumpRx when they could have paid less by relying on insurance.\n\n“The bottom line is that the agreements will not decrease prices for most Americans,” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies pharmaceutical policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\nExecutives for each of the drugmakers appeared with Mr. Trump and other cabinet officials in the White House’s Roosevelt Room. They arrived long before him, standing awkwardly on live video until his arrival. When Mr. Trump entered the room, he began the event by displaying and touting his new “gold card” — a way for immigrants to obtain visas for $1 million each, plus processing fees.\n\nAfter his initial remarks, the pharmaceutical executives each gave a short speech. Most thanked the president, saying it was an honor to lower their prices.\n\nIn exchange for some lower prices, the companies secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs that Mr. Trump might have imposed on imported pharmaceuticals, administration officials said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to levy punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.\n\nThe three major drugmakers that have yet to reach deals with the administration are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron. Representatives for those companies all said they were still in talks with the administration.\n\nMr. Trump said that Johnson & Johnson and a few other companies would announce price-cutting deals in the coming days.\n\nIn the United States, prices for brand-name drugs are three times as high, on average, as those in other wealthy nations. Mr. Trump has long complained that the United States is unfairly subsidizing lower prices in European countries, a view echoed by many pharmaceutical executives.\n\nThe deals announced on Friday do not address the high costs of most drugs already on the market that are covered under private insurance or other government health insurance programs like Medicare. Those costs are borne by U.S. employers and consumers who pay in the form of taxes, health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn his first term, Mr. Trump unsuccessfully tried to use regulation to force drugmakers to lower some Medicare prices to the levels in European countries. A federal court blocked the effort, ruling that the administration had skipped steps in the policymaking process. But had it been carried out, it would have been a major change in how the United States pays for medicines.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration posted documents online proposing a very different, and more modest, version of the international price comparison idea.\n\nManufacturers are required to pay a rebate to Medicare when they increase certain prices faster than the rate of inflation. Currently, those rebates are calculated based on drug prices in the United States.\n\nUnder the new proposed rules, called GLOBE and GUARD, the government would test an approach that would instead calculate those rebates based on drug prices in other wealthy countries.\n\nJuliette Cubanski, a Medicare expert at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, said such a change could lead to “relatively modest” savings for Medicare. Still, she said, “I’m not sure it represents a substantially more significant threat to drug industry revenues than the existing inflation rebate program does.”\n\nReed Abelson contributed reporting.",

    "description": "Researchers noticed ‘dramatic’ changes in nutrients in crops, including drop in zinc and rise in lead",
    "fullText": "Researchers noticed ‘dramatic’ changes in nutrients in crops, including drop in zinc and rise in lead\n\nMore carbon dioxide in the environment is making food more calorific but less nutritious – and also potentially more toxic, a study has found.\n\nSterre ter Haar, a lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and other researchers at the institution created a method to compare multiple studies on plants’ responses to increased CO2 levels. The results, she said, were a shock: although crop yields increase, they become less nutrient-dense. While zinc levels in particular drop, lead levels increase.\n\n“Seeing how dramatic some of the nutritional changes were, and how this differed across plants, was a big surprise,” she told the Guardian. “We aren’t seeing a simple dilution effect but rather a complete shift in the composition of our foods … This also raises the question of whether we should adjust our diets in some way, or how we grow or produce our food.”\n\nWhile scientists have been looking at the effects of more CO2 in the atmosphere on plants for a decade, their work has been difficult to compare. The new research established a baseline measurement derived from the observation that the gas appears to have a linear effect on growth, meaning that if the CO2 level doubles, so does the effect on nutrients. This made it possible to compare almost 60,000 measurements across 32 nutrients and 43 crops, including rice, potatoes, tomatoes and wheat.\n\n“Although there was a lot of data from previous studies, there were few answers,” said Ter Haar. “These studies used paired experiments, where plants were grown under identical conditions except for one thing: the CO2 level. This gives insight into possible changes, but the sample sizes were usually too small to draw conclusions from. Comparing these individual studies with each other was difficult because, as we know, the baseline of CO2 is continuously increasing in our atmosphere, meaning that the baseline in these experiments is also increasing.”\n\nTheir “baseline” measurement was a gas concentration of 350 parts per million – sometimes referred to as the last “safe” level. They compared this with a concentration of 550 parts per million, which some scientists expect to be reached by 2065. Most nutrients would respond negatively to the rise in concentration, they said, with an average drop of 3.2%.\n\nHowever, zinc in chickpeas would be expected to plummet by up to 37.5%, with a “significant” decrease in protein, zinc and iron in essential crops such as rice and wheat. The researchers warned of “devastating health consequences” including “hidden hunger, where people have sufficient food calorically but insufficient nutrients”.\n\nThe CO2 level is now 425.2 parts per million, the paper said, which had already resulted in “lowered levels of plant nutrition due to CO2 rise”.\n\nThe study is part of a growing body of research on the impact of climate breakdown on crops, not only outdoors but also in artificial conditions. The Netherlands is one of the world’s largest agricultural exporters, with three-quarters of its production for export and more than 4,100 hectares of greenhouses, where crops are grown in CO2-enriched environments to increase the yield.\n\n“Climate change isn’t a faraway problem,” said Ter Haar. “The effects are already on our dinner plate.”\n\nOther experts welcomed the Dutch study, saying it was a good basis for further investigation. Courtney Leisner, an assistant professor at the school of plant and environmental sciences at Virginia Tech in the US, coauthored a study earlier this year on how crop improvement strategies could counteract the negative effects of CO2 on crop quality. “This study offers critical insights into how environmental conditions affect crop nutritional quality, which is essential for sustaining future food security,” she said.\n\nThere are, however, other factors such as fertiliser application that play an important role in how nutritious our crops are, said Jan Verhagen, a researcher on climate change and sustainable agriculture at Wageningen University.\n\n“Indeed, nutrient levels in plants are changing,” he said. “Whether this is only related to CO2 is, I believe, less clear … we know that nutrition is a key factor in food security and health in general, so it makes sense to shift the focus on this topic.”\n\nHe said more experiments would be needed to help design breeding programmes for crops with certain nutrient levels under different environmental stresses to better understand the effects of agricultural practices.\n\nThe meta-analysis raises as many questions as it answers, said Ter Haar – who wants to do further study on climate change and nutrients.\n\n“Our goal isn’t to scare people,” she said. “The first step in solving a problem is acknowledging it, and with that, we think our study could be a useful puzzle piece.”\n\nThe research was published in the journal Global Change Biology.",

    "fullText": "Tasha Huo and I don't make it a minute into our conversation before we start gushing about wizards — and that's how I know I'm talking to a true Critical Role fan.\n\nHuo is the showrunner of \"The Mighty Nein,\" Critical Role's second animated series with Prime Video. \"The Mighty Nein\" follows the success of \"The Legend of Vox Machina,\" the series for which Critical Role raised over $11.3 million in Kickstarter seed funding in 2019. Now, Huo, a longtime viewer of the show, is the series' creative writing powerhouse.\n\nHuo, who's based in Los Angeles, said she first started playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" as a kid, but hadn't touched the game for years. In her adult life, a friend wanted her to join his \"D&D\" campaign and recommended a Twitch stream that he said would help her understand how the game worked.\n\nThat turned out to be Critical Role. At the time, the company's eight cofounders were in the midst of their second long-running campaign. And the stream that Huo watched, so many years ago now, has taken on an animated series form in \"The Mighty Nein.\"\n\n\"I was absolutely hooked. I was like, this is all I can watch now, and it's all I can listen to in the car. And I binged it, which took years,\" Huo said of the 141-episode campaign.\n\nSeveral industry contacts recommended Huo to Critical Role in 2021 when they were looking for a showrunner.\n\nHuo started work on the show in November 2022 as part of the Prime Video team and oversaw its writing until its release this fall, working 9-to-5 daily with three other writers and a writer's assistant. She has an MFA in screenwriting from Boston University and has written for other shows, including \"The Witcher: Blood Origin,\" released in 2022, and \"Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft,\" released in 2024.\n\n\"It started with me having a lot of conversations with Critical Role. I met with Sam Riegel first, and then Travis Willingham and Matt Mercer, and we all just nerded out,\" Huo said. Riegel, a cofounder, oversees much of Critical Role's animation business alongside the team's CEO, Willingham. Mercer is the crew's chief creative officer.\n\n\"It was kind of like coming home. It was just all these pieces coming together that started over a love of 'D&D,'\" Huo added\n\nHuo said conversations in the Critical Role writer's room involved many talks with the eight cofounders about their campaign characters. She wanted to find the best way to condense the hundreds of hours of campaign stream time into eight, 44-minute episodes.\n\n\"The conversations always started with all of us in a room talking about the characters, talking about why they felt the way they did or why they did the thing they did,\" Huo said.\n\nHuo says these character conversations helped her figure out what the first season's arc would be.\n\n\"Every day we would come into the Critical Role offices. And we had a giant whiteboard up with magnets, and we'd come up with ideas of like, 'Okay, if we know what the season arc is, now let's start thinking about some turning points within the episode,'\" Huo said.\n\nHaving so many hours of source material also meant that Huo and the writing team had to make tough decisions about what to focus on in the first season. Huo said it quickly became clear to them that the plotline for cofounder Liam O'Brien's character, the wizard Caleb Widogast, needed to be covered first for the rest of the show to make sense.\n\n\"A lot of his backstory is really linked to a larger story that we were telling,\" Huo said.\n\nThe season's final cut also included several tidbits of information that were not in the original Twitch stream.\n\nHuo also got to live the Critical Role fan dream and suss out all the juicy details from Mercer that had never aired on stream — including the ins and outs of how the season's key antagonists, the Volstrucker wizards, worked.\n\n\"We get to tell a side spy show within 'The Mighty Nein,' and that's really gratifying because you sit Matt down and he has all the answers already, so you just mine from all of the great stuff that he has and fill the story up with all of those things,\" Huo said.\n\nI asked Huo how one might go about landing a dream writing job, and she had two tips.\n\n\"I would say the first thing is to dedicate yourself to the craft. Always be writing, even when there's negativity and there's rejection, just keep going. I think the number one reason people don't make it is because they give up before someone else,\" Huo said.\n\nAs for her second piece of advice for writers: \"Don't be afraid of what you love.\"\n\n\"I remember when I met with Sam Riegel, I was so embarrassed. I thought, 'Oh no, I fangirled too much when I talked to him,'\" Huo said. \"And it turns out that's exactly what they wanted to hear, from someone who really, really loved the show.\"\n\nDo you work on the Critical Role franchise and have a story to share?

The advisory did not specify what anyone on a visa already outside the country with a postponed appointment should do.\n\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nGoogle's warning echoes a wave of internal travel advisories that swept through corporate America in September, as the Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas.\n\nThe H-1B visa typically lasts up to three years and can often be extended. If someone needs a new H-1B visa stamp, they typically must apply at a US embassy or consulate in their home country or a country where they have lawful residence.\n\nAs a general matter, said immigration attorney Jason Finkelman, who focuses on employment and family immigration, foreign nationals should be able to return to the US after travel abroad if they have a valid visa stamp and aren't subject to any entry restrictions, including the Trump administration's expanded travel ban, which the White House says takes effect January 1.\n\nThat's where enhanced vetting can complicate an otherwise routine trip. If an H-1B worker leaves the US to get a new visa stamp and their consular appointment is canceled or delayed — sometimes by months — they can be stuck abroad until the visa is issued.\n\n\"My advice to clients is that if travel isn't essential right now, better to stay put,\" Finkelman said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of State said consular officers \"do not issue a visa unless the applicant can credibly demonstrate they meet all requirements under US law — including that they intend to engage only in activities consistent with the terms of their visa.\"\n\nThe H-1B program, which is capped at 85,000 new visas a year, serves as a core pipeline for employers hiring skilled foreign workers. Tech giants have long been among the largest users of the visa, with companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta topping the lists of approved new H-1B petitions in recent years. ￼\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the program has become a political flash point, with the White House framing H-1Bs as a threat to American jobs and rolling out measures that critics and employers say make it harder and more expensive to hire new workers.",

    "fullText": "As investigators work to find a motive behind the mass shooting at Brown University and the slaying of an acclaimed MIT professor, former classmates of the accused killer described him as a brilliant but exceptionally difficult student.\n\nClaudio Neves Valente, the 48-year-old suspect who police say was found dead Thursday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was a top student but a disruptive personality in his native Portugal, recalled classmates on Friday.\n\nNeves Valente studied at Instituto Superior Técnico along with Nuno Loureiro, the MIT professor he is now accused of shooting to death. The school confirmed to CNN that both men were students there between 1995 and 2000, and that Neves Valente studied for a degree in Technological Physics Engineering.\n\nThat engineering course was full of gifted students, recalled classmate Felipe Moura – but Neves Valente stood out, for good and bad reasons.\n\n“Claudio was obviously one of the best, but in class he had a great need to stand out and show that he was better than the rest,” Moura wrote in Portuguese in a Facebook post.\n\n“Claudio’s attitude was unpleasant,” he continued, often arguing with “colleagues he didn’t consider as brilliant as him (and who probably weren’t),” he wrote. “They were totally unnecessary quarrels, which did not help the class at all.”\n\nMoura, who now teaches at a Lisbon university, did not respond to messages from CNN. A former classmate, who asked not to be quoted by name, confirmed that Moura’s Facebook account was authentic.\n\nIn an interview with Público, a newspaper in Portugal, Moura echoed his impressions of Neves Valente as an aggressive classmate.\n\n“He had a confrontational personality in class. In other words, the other good students would intervene, ask questions, [but] Claudio liked to say that he was the one who knew,” Moura told the paper.\n\nNuno Morais, another classmate, told Público that Neves Valente and Loureiro were among the top students at the school – but their personalities were starkly different.\n\n“Claudio was one of the students with the best grades in the course. He was much more theoretical,” Morais told the paper. “Nuno was also a good student, he stood out less in terms of grades, but he was a more relaxed person—and seemed to have a knack for slightly more applied subjects.”\n\nAfter graduating in Portugal, Neves Valente enrolled at Brown University in 2000 as a graduate student in physics but did not finish the program. Moura said he stayed in touch with Neves Valente at the time and found that he was once again clashing with other students.\n\n“I exchanged many emails with him at the time and saw that he maintained the same attitude — as he told me —of maintaining unnecessary conflicts with PhD colleagues in class, which he again considered far less capable than he was,” Moura wrote on Facebook. “I could tell that he wasn’t enjoying being at Brown University.”\n\nScott Watson, a classmate at Brown, said Valente was “socially awkward” and that he became his only friend at the university. He struggled in the US, complaining bitterly that classes weren’t challenging and that the food was poor, Watson recalled.\n\n“He would say the classes were too easy—honestly, for him they were. He already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive,” Watson, who is now a professor at Syracuse University, said in a statement shared with CNN.\n\nWatson said Valente could be “kind and gentle” but that he was also volatile as well.\n\n“He often became frustrated—sometimes angry—about courses, professors, and living conditions,” Watson said, recalling that once he had to break up a fight between Valente and another classmate he often insulted.\n\nMoura said he tried to convince Valente to stay with the graduate program, but he left after one year.\n\n“Claudio thought none of it was worth it, which was a waste of time and the others were all incapable,” he said on Facebook.\n\nIn an archived Brown website, Neves Valente appears to write to classmates that he’s left the school “permanently.” The note, first reported by the New York Times, includes an email address to reach him and a cryptic note: “The best liar is he who is able to fool himself. They are everywhere, but sometimes proliferate in the most unexpected places.”\n\nA directory of physics graduate students at Brown from that time links to the website alongside a student email address for Neves Valente. The directory shows that he was assigned to room 122 at the Barus and Holley engineering building. Neves Valente carried out his shooting in room 166 in the same building last week, police say.\n\nIt’s unclear what Neves Valente did in the intervening years. Moura wrote on Facebook that he heard he’d returned to Portugal to work for an internet provider; police say he received a visa and returned to the US in 2017, though it is unclear what he did for work.\n\nHis last known address was in Miami, police said.\n\nHis former classmates have been left trying to understand what could have motivated the brutal violence.\n\n“I never expected he would be capable of such a thing,” Moura wrote.\n\nCNN’s Vasco Cotovio, Thomas Bordeaux, Julia Vargas Jones contributed to this report.",

    "title": "The Burger Chain Some Customers Say Isn't Hitting Like It Used To",
    "description": "Every if they've been around for many years, the quality can start to slip at some fast food restaurants. Here's one burger chain customers aren't happy with.",
    "fullText": "One might argue that the longest running and most popular fast food burger chains (think McDonald's, Burger King, and White Castle) have stood the test of time by maintaining consistency in the quality of their food. Regrettably, due to a variety of factors including the rising cost of ingredients, some beloved fast food chains are losing their edge in 2025. Case in point: according to a number of Whataburger customers, the popular southern burger chain's food quality has significantly dwindled.\n\nWhile smaller than some fast food mega-chains, Whataburger is another long-running quick-service chain that first opened in 1950 in Corpus Christi, Texas. Today, the burger chain has a total of over 1,000 locations, close to 800 of which are located in Texas. Whataburger has a variety of popular menu items but is mostly known for its burgers that are made-to-order with never frozen beef patties.\n\nHowever, according to several customers on Reddit in the r/Whataburger thread, the quality of Whataburger has gone down in recent years, mainly since the start of the pandemic. The original poster, a self-described lifelong Whataburger diner, claims to have noticed a difference in taste, to which numerous fellow Redditors agree.\n\nIt should be noted that despite customer complaints, Whataburger saw a sales growth of 9.4% in 2024, amounting to the highest revenue in its history, according to data from Franchise Times. Meanwhile, McDonald's, the largest quick service restaurant in the world, experienced a small 0.9% sales growth in 2024.\n\nSome Redditors are not happy with the state of their Whataburger burgers and fries in particular. One customer stated, \"I'm in Texas and the locations near me have really turned bad. They were once really good and fresh, now the 20-25 minute wait is for old tasting and low quality burgers and fries and breakfast.\" Many complaints have to do with the fries, which are reportedly no longer hot and crispy like they used to be, as well as the decrease in burger toppings and overall quality.\n\nSome also have complaints about the poor service they've received. One person vented, \"Quality of food has dropped since they sold out and customer service diminished as well. I gave up on them 2 years ago. Even though the free meal offers kept getting sent out for me to return, I declined them.\" There is speculation online that the quality of Whataburger's food has declined since the majority stake in the company was sold in 2019 to Chicago-based investment bank BDT Capital Partners.\n\nAs with many business transitions from family-owned to corporate-owned, there is a perception of reduced attention to quality to accommodate for expansion. However, it's difficult to quantify whether the food has gone downhill across the board or, as with many fast food restaurants, people have received a bad batch here and there. You'll have to decide the truth of Whataburger for yourself.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, Get taste tests, food & drink news, deals from your favorite chains, recipes, cooking tips, and more!",

    "fullText": "A maiden launch turned into an unfortunate event when a newly built yacht tipped over and sank within minutes. It was a sullen moment for the owner, but for many, the spectacle was a reminder of the excesses of the ultra-rich.\n\nAccording to The Economic Times, the 24-meter luxury yacht Dolce Vento had just completed construction and was on its maiden launch when it abruptly listed sideways and sank roughly 200 meters off the coast of Ereğli, Turkey.\n\nSHOCKING: Luxury yacht Dolce Vento sinks just 15 minutes after launch off Ereğli, Turkey! Passengers, including the owner, swam to shore in a panic. No injuries reported. Watch the dramatic video! pic.twitter.com/dLi8NejsGF\n\n— Greek City Times (@greekcitytimes) September 3, 2025\n\nThe Greek City Times (@greekcitytimes) shared the video on X, saying, \"Shocking: Luxury yacht Dolce Vento sinks just 15 minutes after launch.\"\n\nThe incident didn't hurt anyone — the owner, captain, and two crew members were able to jump into the sea and swim safely to land.\n\nHowever, it sparked concerns about design flaws and construction issues. It also prompted discussions on the environmental toll of luxury yachts and other extravagances. An Oxfam International research showed that 50 of the world's wealthiest people produce more pollution than 155 million of the poorest people combined.\n\nSuperyachts, in particular, have even been found to produce more than three times the pollution of private jets. As yachts become more common among wealthy owners, concerns have grown about how their fuel use may contribute to amplifying droughts, storms, and heatwaves.\n\nNature has already sent warnings, including a waterspout that destroyed a billionaire's yacht in Palermo last year, a sign that warmer seas are creating more dangerous weather events.\n\nNot only that, yachts and other recreational watercraft also destroy coral reefs as they sail along shallow parts of the coast. Moreover, they have frequently brought invasive aquatic species — one of the biggest drivers of biodiversity loss — into various parts of the world, according to the International Maritime Organization.\n\nGiven these concerns, many people expressed mixed feelings — shock at the incident and renewed attention on the environmental impact of large luxury vessels.\n\nWhile some readers treated the moment lightly, the event has also sparked broader conversations about climate issues and how individual choices can affect the environment.\n\nDo you think the construction industry is too wasteful?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Happiest day for a boat owner…the day they buy the boat, and the day they sell it. This guy had both days combined into one,\" one social media user said on X.\n\n\"The boat was built quite nicely. It just didn't float,\" another commented on Reddit.\n\n\"Yeah, if that's $1M, it's a TEMU version of a yacht, the big boys pay $1M for the tender boat that takes you out to your yacht,\" added another Redditor.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "The holiday season always brings out the specialty coffee drinkers, whether they are fans of Starbucks' Peppermint Mocha or Caramel Brulée Latte, or maybe Peet's Dubai Style Chocolate Matcha or Pistachio CBOL.\n\nThe wait for one of these holiday treats in coffee shops or drive-thru lanes can take longer than normal as a result of the higher demand this time of year.\n\nBut many customers believe it is worth the wait to enjoy one of these tasty drinks.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the year may not have been as bright and shiny as the holiday season seems, as coffee chain giant Starbucks plans 100s of store closings. Peet's also closed several locations, but has some good news on the horizon.\n\nStarbucks in September revealed that it would reduce its North American store count by about 1%, or from 18,734 shops to 18,300 by the end of fiscal year 2025, as part of a restructuring that is expected to cost the coffee giant $1 billion.\n\nStarbucks reviewed its North America portfolio earlier this year to determine which locations it would close.\n\n\"During the review, we identified coffeehouses where we're unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance, and these locations will be closed,\" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement.\n\nThe company will target underperforming stores, or those that can't meet new design standards, for closing. The company is conducting a multi-year remodeling plan for 1,000 locations at a cost of $150,000 per store through 2026.\n\nReduce store count by 434 locations, or 1%, by the end of fiscal year 2025.\n\nRemodel 1,000 locations at $150,000 per store by the end of 2026.\n\nPeet's, which has over 250 locations in the U.S. with 199 corporate-owned stores, according to The E'ville Eye, closed California locations in Roseville in May, Sacramento Airport in September, and in Mill Valley in November.\n\nThe good news for Peet's came in August as Keurig Dr Pepper revealed that it would buy the company's parent JDE Peet's for $18 billion in a transaction that is expected to close in the first half of 2026.\n\nAnd now, troubled Starbucks rival coffee chain Compass Coffee has agreed to vacate its Washington, D.C., roastery location and has indicated in court papers that it might file for bankruptcy protection by the end of the year.\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based coffee company agreed to relinquish its roastery facility at 1401 Okie Street, almost three months after a D.C. Superior Court Associate Judge Leslie Meek in September ordered Compass Coffee to pay monthly rent while a landlord lawsuit against the tenant proceeded, according to the Washington Business Journal.\n\nCompass Coffee's landlord American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association in September filed for a protective order to require the tenant to pay an initial payment of over $113,000 and then over $116,000 per month starting on Oct. 1, which the judge granted.\n\nCasual Mexican restaurant chain closes more locations\n\n79-year-old national trucking company closes down, no bankruptcy\n\n65-year-old Home Depot rival shutters business permanently\n\nThe tenant had not paid rent since January 2025, according to court papers.\n\nBoth Compass Coffee CEO Michael Haft and the company's lawyer Theodore B. Randles of Venable LLP indicated in September that the company would have to vacate the premises or possibly file for bankruptcy if the coffee chain couldn't negotiate a rent reduction.\n\nCompass Coffee owes its landlord, American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association, over $744,000 in rent and related fees, Washington Business Journal reported.\n\nThe coffee company also owes over $300,000 in back rent to the property's previous landlord, Douglas Development Corp., according to a lawsuit filed by that landlord.\n\nCompass Coffee was established in 2014 and currently operates 25 locations in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland.\n\n4710 Langston Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n4300 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n4100 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n3003 Washington Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n7393 Lee Highway, Falls Church, Va.\n\n1201 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n4850 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n1351 Wisconsin Ave. NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n2150 P St. NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n849 18th St. NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n1703 H.

    "description": "It is only the second pendant like it ever found in the world, discovered during an excavation beneath the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nArchaeologists discovered a rare 1,300-year-old lead pendant in Jerusalem decorated with the image of a menorah.\n\nIt is only the second pendant like it ever found in the world, discovered during an excavation beneath the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount.\n\nThe pendant is dated to a time Jews were restricted from being in Jerusalem, making the discovery especially surprising.\n\nDiscovering a symbol of Jewish faith within an excavation of Jerusalem typically wouldn’t prompt much surprise, but archaeologists recently made an exceedingly rare find during an excavation of the Temple Mount in the form of a lead pendant decorated with a menorah. The 1,300-year-old pendant, only the second like it ever found in the world, is dated to the Late Byzantine period, from the sixth to the early seventh century C.E., found left in Jerusalem in a time Jews were prohibited from the site.\n\n“A pendant made of pure lead, decorated with a menorah, is an exceptionally rare find,” a research team with the Israel Antiquities Authority, said in a statement. “Research has identified pendants of glass and other metals decorated with a menorah, but we know of only one other pendant in the world [now located in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore] bearing the symbol of the menorah made of lead.”\n\nThe newly discovered pendant features a seven-branched menorah design identical on both sides. The researchers said that the “double appearance of the menorah on each side of the disc indicates the deep significance of this symbol, and the central place of the menorah in the visual expression of connection to the temple and its memory, even in periods long after the destruction of the temple.”\n\nThe piece was located during archaeological excavation in the Davidson Archaeological Park of Jerusalem under 26 feet of fill that piled up as part of construction activities during the creation of an Islamic monument at the beginning of the eighth century.\n\n“One day while I was digging inside an ancient structure, I suddenly saw something different, gray, among the stones,” Ayayu Belete, a City of David worker, said in a statement. “I picked up the object and saw that it was a pendant with a menorah on it.”\n\nThe disc-shaped pendant features a loop at the top, likely so it could be worn as a necklace. The identical menorah—each one has three arms on either side of the central shaft, a horizontal crossbar at the top of each arm, and flames—fits inside a circular frame. The researchers said that one side was well-preserved, while the other had a high level of patina. Analytical laboratory testing confirmed the pendent is 99 percent lead.\n\n“This is an unusual find,” said Yuval Baruch, Israel Antiquities Authority archaeologist. “This pendant, bearing the symbol of the menorah, is not just a material object, it is a personal seal, an emblem of memory and identity, which probably belonged to an anonymous Jew who chose to wear it around his or her neck.”\n\nDuring the Byzantine period, Jews were prohibited form entering Jerusalem, leading to questions about how the pendant could have made its way to the temple area. The experts surmise the pendant could have come from a secret pilgrim entering the city under unofficial circumstances, or from a Jew visiting on an administrative mission or as a merchant.\n\n“Even during periods when Jews were prohibited from entering Jerusalem, the connection to this holy place did not cease,” Amichai Eliyahu, Israeli minister of heritage, said in a statement.\n\nBaruch said that not only does the pendant show a personal devotion to the Jewish faith, but that imperial edicts prohibiting Jews from going to the city did not stop everyone. Using lead, instead of other popular metals of the day, was common in amulet-making at the time, Baruch said, meaning the pendant had more meaning than as a decorative piece of jewelry. The use of lead also opened more possibilities of who could have worked the piece. “During the Byzantine period the menorah became a symbol of national memory, and it expressed the expectation of national revival among the Jewish communities in the land of Israel,” Baruch said.\n\nThe Israel Antiquities Authority plans to display the find during Hanukkah in Jerusalem at the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel.\n\n“In recent years there is increased archaeological evidence that shows that Jews, despite all the prohibitions and difficulties imposed on them, found ways to reach Jerusalem,” Baruch said, “and it is possible that there were even some who settled there.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "One of U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's daughters said she experienced an “absurdly invasive” pat-down Thursday at an airport security checkpoint and suggested her father would limit or eliminate the Transportation Security Administration if it was under his authority.\n\nEvita Duffy-Alfonso said on the social platform X that she nearly missed her flight after opting out of a body scan because she said she is pregnant and concerned about radiation exposure. She said she waited 15 minutes for a pat-down and that TSA agents were “rude” and “tried to pressure\" her into walking through the scanner.\n\n“All this for an unconstitutional agency that isn’t even good at its job,” she said.\n\nTSA said in a statement Friday it is aware of Duffy-Alfonso’s complaint.\n\n“TSA takes complaints about airport security screening procedures seriously and investigates complaints thoroughly to ensure the correct procedures are applied,” the agency said.\n\nIn another post, Duffy-Alfonso said her father would “radically limit” or “lobby Congress to abolish” TSA if it was under his control.\n\nDuffy’s Department of Transportation controls the Federal Aviation Administration and is charged with setting and enforcing safety regulations for all major modes of transportation, including air travel. But TSA is part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nTSA is responsible for screening passengers, bags and cargo for weapons or explosives. It was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n“The ‘golden age of transportation’ cannot begin until the TSA is gone,” Duffy-Alfonso said, a reference to her father’s broad campaign to make travel more family friendly and revive what he calls “the golden age of travel,” including a recent push encouraging passengers to dress more formally while flying.\n\nThe Transportation Department declined Friday to comment on Duffy-Alfonso's complaints about TSA.\n\nIn a follow-up post on X, Duffy-Alfonso clarified that she supports President Donald Trump and Homeland Security, “but there needs to be more common sense around how we treat Americans exercising their right to travel,” she said.\n\nAccording to TSA, passengers can request a private screening as an alternative to the body scanner. The agency warns on its website that “sufficient pressure must be applied in order to ensure detection” because a “pat-down screening is conducted to determine whether prohibited items are concealed under clothing.”",

    "description": "Corrections Officer David Kingsley was found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Robert Brooks. He was sentenced to life in prison.",
    "fullText": "The wind howled outside the Oneida County courthouse as David Kingsley stood before Judge Robert Bauer and was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the beating death of Robert Brooks.\n\nBrooks, an incarcerated individual transferred to Marcy Corrections Facility on Dec. 9, 2024, was brutally beaten with his hands cuffed behind his back by corrections officers while in custody. He died as a result of his injuries the next day. An autopsy was conducted by the Onondaga County Medical Examiner's Office and, in February, Brooks' death was ruled a homicide.\n\nThree of the four corrections officers charged in the case who had not taken a plea deal with the special prosecutor have gone to trial: David Kingsley, Mathew Galliher, and Nicholas Kieffer.\n\nKingsley was found guilty of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter while Galliher and Kieffer were acquitted.\n\nRobert Brooks Jr., Brooks’ son, and Jared Ricks, Brooks’ brother, had a chance to deliver a victim impact statement directly to Kingsley.\n\nBrooks Jr. said he remembered watching his father being beaten and feeling like he was stuck in a horror movie.\n\nRicks said the number of lives affected by the death of his brother has been unthinkable and that the actions of the corrections officers at Marcy robbed Brooks of his life, liberty, and happiness.\n\n“I pray that the court imposes a sentence severe enough to tell correctional officers that they cannot treat incarcerated individuals like animals and I pray that this court imposes a sentence severe enough to tell incarcerated individuals that their lives matter,” Brooks Jr. said.\n\nOnondaga County Assistant District Attorney Jed Hudson said that Kingsley, from the very beginning, was there — carrying Brooks by his feet, wrenching Brooks up by the neck, and holding Brooks by the neck against the wall with Nicholas Anzalone.\n\n“With his entire 300-pound frame, he lifted a 140-pound restrained man off a table by his throat,” Hudson said. “And for no reason.”\n\nHudson requested the maximum sentence against Kingsley.\n\n“It was Mr. Kingsley’s right to go to trial, but Mr. Kingsley made Mr. Brooks’ family sit in a courtroom, surrounded by people they didn’t know, and watched Robert Brooks die,” Hudson said. “Kingsley alone, of every major player who inflicted horrible injuries on Robert Brooks, insisted on taking responsibility for what he did.”\n\nWhen asked if he had anything to say to the court, Kingsley apologized for his actions that day.\n\n“I’d like to express my sincerest condolences to the Brooks family for the tragic loss they’ve suffered,” Kingsley said. “I know nothing I say or do can change the outcome. All of the events that happened over the last three days of Robert Brooks’ life should have never happened. Every single incident was senseless.”\n\nKingsley was sentenced to an indeterminate time to life in state prison for second-degree murder and 25 years for first-degree manslaughter.\n\nInvestigation: Utica Police Department investigating fatal shooting\n\nRetirement: Oneida County Legislature Chairman retiring after 45 years\n\nFire: DOCCS investigating fire at Marcy Correctional\n\nAfter the sentencing, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said he felt Kingsley’s apology was sincere, but “...far too late.”\n\n“Every defendant reacts differently when they’re sentenced. Some stay silent. I think Mr. Kingsley reflected on the gravity of the situation and it may have been the first time it dawned on him. I don’t think he joined the New York State Department of Corrections to become an animal. But someone has to address the issue of what happened here and what changed him to have such utter and abject disregard for a fellow human being’s life.”\n\nFitzpatrick added that everyone involved who laid hands on Robert Brooks and physically beat him is now serving a substantial prison sentence.\n\nReflecting on that, Fitzpatrick admitted that when meeting with Brooks Jr. for the first time, Brooks Jr. didn’t expect anything other than resignation and probationary sentences.\n\n“This is the first case in my memory where a New York State corrections officer has been convicted and sentenced for killing an incarcerated individual,” Fitzpatrick added.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Observer-Dispatch: Oneida County corrections officer sentenced to life in prison",

I forgive you.”\n\nSmith announced her resignation, effective Dec. 31, earlier this month.\n\nIt comes amid federal scrutiny and an interim House Oversight Committee report that accused Smith of creating a toxic work environment and pressuring officers to manipulate crime data.\n\nDC interim police chief plans to lead with ‘integrity’ ‘transparency’ after Pamela Smith’s resignation\n\nSmith denied all allegations of manipulating crime data, invoking her faith in God and delivering a sermon-like speech.\n\n“Never would I, never will, compromise my integrity for a few crime numbers. I said it and it’s on the record,” said Smith. “Never would I compromise my love for God, the faith I have in this city. Never would I compromise my integrity, never would I compromise 28 years in law enforcement for a few folks who couldn’t stand to be held accountable. And if I had to do it all over again, I’d do it again.”\n\nSmith was appointed as chief of police in 2023 amid a crime spike in the District. That year, the city saw 274 homicides.\n\nIn 2024, the number dropped to 182. To date this year, there have been 126 homicides.\n\n“I don’t have to talk about what I’ve done in this city,” said Smith. “May the work I’ve done speak for me.”\n\nSmith closed with another strong message.\n\n“The same folks that said in their reports that they changed their numbers and I did not, the report said I did not direct anyone, you should investigate those folks,” she said.\n\nEarlier this week, Mayor Muriel Bowser appointed Jeffery Carroll as interim police chief.\n\nHe’ll be sworn in following Smith’s final day. As of now, an official time and date have not been set.",

It's high, it's dangerous, I think he's very lucky not to get red,\" Parkinson said.\n\n\"He's injured his knee and he's dislocated his shoulder.\n\n\"It's tough for him because he's been good for us, Lewis, and he was coming back to a club he was at last year.\"\n\nWhen asked about Parkinson's criticism of the Galbraith tackle, Swansea head coach Vitor Matos said: \"That's what Phil said, that's his opinion, I have nothing to comment on that.\n\n\"I will not comment on the referee's performance, that's not for me. That's for someone else, so yeah, nothing to say.\"\n\nParkinson says Wrexham will have to wait to discover how long O'Brien faces on the sidelines.\n\n\"But of course it doesn't look good,\" he added. \"He's a tough player and he's not coming off unless it's something really serious.\"\n\nListen to the latest Swansea City interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds\n\nListen to the latest Wrexham interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe University of Texas athletic department has been ranked the most valuable in college sports for 2025, according to a CNBC valuation released this week. Texas’s program is estimated at $1.48 billion, a 16% increase from the prior year and enough to vault the Longhorns past leader Ohio State.\n\nOhio State which held the top spot in last year’s ranking, slipped to second despite a 2% valuation increase, landing at approximately $1.35 billion.\n\nCNBC’s reporter Michael Ozanian values the 75 most valuable college athletic programs at a combined $51.2 billion, up 13% from 2024. The surge reflects escalating revenue streams, including media rights, sponsorships and the expanding impact of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals for student-athletes.\n\nTexas A&M retains the No. 3 spot at roughly $1.32 billion, while Georgia and Michigan round out the top five, each valued at about $1.16 billion. Notre Dame is sixth at $1.13 billion, followed by Tennessee at $1.12 billion and USC at $1.10 billion. Alabama and Nebraska are also among the top 10, all topping the $1 billion threshold.\n\nOf the top 25 athletic departments, 12 programs hail from the Southeastern Conference, with multiple SEC schools valued above $1.3 billion. Oregon sit just below the billion-dollar mark, despite a lucrative tie to Nike.\n\nThe widening valuations demonstrate how the business of college sports continues to grow, fueled largely by football revenues and lucrative conference television deals. The rise of NIL compensation packages has further broadened the financial abilities of elite programs, with some universities leveraging star athletes to enhance revenue and marketability.\n\nThe annual valuation shows a shifting landscape in collegiate athletics, where financial muscle increasingly figures into competitive balance and strategic planning across the four major conferences.\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nPat McAfee delivers reality check to Diego Pavia for Heisman weekend antics\n\nFernando Mendoza won't keep the Heisman Trophy\n\nWhy LSU should be extremely nervous about Michigan firing Sherrone Moore",

    "fullText": "With the January window fast approaching, Manchester United have a lot on their plate, and the whole Kobbie Mainoo situation is only adding to the uneasy atmosphere around the club.\n\nRuben Amorim’s treatment of the Englishman has been genuinely surprising. There is an obvious gap at the base of the midfield, where Casemiro is currently the preferred option.\n\nThe Brazilian hardly managed to last the full 90 minutes, while Manuel Ugarte’s Old Trafford adventure seems to be drawing to a close.\n\nDespite this, the head coach does not feel the Carrington graduate has the requisite skillset to thrive in a deeper role, instead seeing him more as a backup for Bruno Fernandes.\n\nThe club captain hardly ever misses games, which has meant the England international is yet to start a single Premier League game this season.\n\nHe had asked INEOS to allow him to leave on loan in the summer, but the co-owners had instead asked him to stay and fight for his place.\n\nBut with Amorim continuing to ignore him, things have reached a breaking point as per The Daily Mail. Up till this point, all the midfielder was asking for was a loan to jumpstart his chances of making England’s World Cup squad.\n\nBut now, he is open to a permanent exit, with Napoli the frontrunners. His contract situation has only exacerbated his ill-feelings towards his boyhood club.\n\n“United supporters are desperate to see more of the homegrown player, who is yet to start a Premier League game this season… but Mainoo is now considering a permanent exit\n\n“Even in the unlikely event that he is picked ahead of Manuel Ugarte to replace the suspended Casemiro at Aston Villa on Sunday, it will be a temporary fix.\n\n“Daily Mail Sport understands Mainoo’s relationship with his boyhood club is now at breaking point. With no contract proposal on the table, he continues to earn around £40,000 a week – roughly a third of his market value.\n\n“Mainoo sees no future for himself at Old Trafford under Amorim, and if a loan move in January included an option to leave permanently, then he would now consider it.\n\n“Napoli are still at the front of the queue and there is a growing optimism in southern Italy that Antonio Conte will get his man this time, reuniting Mainoo with Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund.”\n\nHis brother’s stunt has certainly not helped his position, while INEOS are unlikely to sanction an exit in January unless a serious acquisition can be made.\n\nAll their top targets like Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson, and Adam Wharton are unlikely to jump ship in the middle of the season.\n\nAnd with the 20-year-old’s current contract still having two years left to run (with the option to add another year), the Red Devils do not need to let him leave on the cheap.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this saga unfolds in the coming weeks.\n\nFeature image Jan Kruger via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Dodgers predicted to break baseball by making blockbuster trade for $500 million two-time Cy Young, would create mythical 1-2 punch with Yoshinobu Yamamoto originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are on their way to becoming a true dynasty after winning back-to-back World Series wins. If they want to secure their place in history, they need to make one more move that would make them legendary.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Christopher Kline, that move is one that’s been floated around a lot recently: trading for Detroit Tigers two-time Cy Young Tarik Skubal.\n\nMORE: Red Sox receive update regarding possible Ketel Marte trade, division rival enters the mix\n\n“Maybe the Detroit Tigers decide to let Skubal finish out his contract and focus all their efforts on winning in 2026, but there's strong incentive to cash in now. The odds of Skubal, a potential $500 million pitcher, re-signing next winter are practically zero. Meanwhile, the Dodgers offer an appealing collection of MLB-ready pitching (Emmet Sheehan, River Ryan, etc.) and up-and-coming bats (Alex Freeland, Zhyir Hope, Daulton Rushing, etc.). I'm not sure another team can outbid the Dodgers if motivated,” Kline wrote.\n\nKline followed up, saying that the Dodgers could also include an All-Star to immediately replace Skubal in the Tigers’ rotation, and this deal would be appealing to Skubal for personal reasons.\n\n“L.A. can also dangle Tyler Glasnow, himself an established, All-Star ace, to sweeten the pot or to replenish prospect depth in a separate deal. The Dodgers are one of the few teams that can operate with the confidence that re-signing Skubal is a realistic end goal. He won't find a better path to multiple World Series titles. He also grew up in California, so it's a homecoming of sorts,” Kline concluded.\n\nMORE: Padres predicted to trade for $15.5 million two-time All-Star ace, would create nasty 1-2-3 punch with Michael King, Nick Pivetta\n\nThis past season, Skubal won his second Cy Young in two years, posting a 13-6 record, a 2.21 ERA, 241 Ks, and a WHIP of 0.891 over 195 innings pitched. Combine him with Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell, Shohei Ohtani, and Roki Sasaki, and the Dodgers get the most mythical rotation of all time.\n\nFor most MLB fans, hopefully this won’t come true. For Dodgers fans, pray L.A. is as committed to winning as they say they are, and get to work on negotiations ASAP.\n\nProposed blockbuster Giants trade sees San Francisco land $6.5 million All-Star ace, would create incredible 1-2 punch with Logan Webb\n\nDiamondbacks predicted to make blockbuster trade for $53 million All-Star ace to temporarily replace Corbin Burnes\n\nRed Sox receive seemingly advantageous update regarding NPB superstar, possible Alex Bregman replacement",

    "fullText": "Benjamin Morrison has missed practices, games and tackles. He’s given up huge pass plays against the Patriots and Bills.\n\nBut for the Bucs rookie cornerback, the biggest issue hasn’t been what happens when he’s on the field, it’s been staying healthy enough to get there.\n\nWith starting cornerback Zyon McCollum on injured reserve with a hip injury, Morrison, a second-round pick from Notre Dame, is being called upon again.\n\nBuy FIRE THE CANNONS: 50 Years of Tampa Bay Buccaneers Football\n\nWill the Panthers have success targeting Morrison Sunday in Charlotte, North Carolina, or will he rise to the occasion this time?\n\n“I think he’s finally healthy, so you’ll probably see the real Benjamin Morrison that we drafted,” Bucs coach Todd Bowles said on Friday. “He had a couple weeks to take in some things mentally and get physically right, so he’s probably in a place where it’s the best place he’s been in this year. So, I think you’ll see the best one we’ve seen.”\n\nThe last time we saw Morrison in a game, he was giving up a 72-yard touchdown pass to the Patriots’ Kyle Williams or losing sight of Bills receiver Tyrell Shavers as Josh Allen connected with him on a scramble drill in the end zone for a 43-yard score.\n\nMorrison has been recovering from a lingering hamstring injury that has kept him out of the past four games.\n\nBut with McCollum placed on injured reserve Monday, Morrison and rookie Jacob Parrish will be counted on to play the cornerback position opposite Jamel Dean.\n\n“It’s a huge opportunity, but at the end of the day it’s just football,” Morrison said. “I’m not going all into the logistics and things. I mean, we just had a walk-through Monday. I’m just wishing the best luck for Zyon. I mean, I’ve been in his shoes. My whole focus is to make sure he’s good and being the best teammate I can be for him.”\n\nOn the whole, Morrison actually has played pretty well this season.\n\nIn the Bucs’ Week 4 loss to the Eagles, he allowed only one catch for nine yards on four targets and broke up a pass intended for A.J. Brown.\n\nThrough Week 9, Morrison had been targeted 18 times, allowing nine catches for 129 yards and a touchdown, according to Pro Football Focus. At the time, his 50% catch rate was second among the top 13 rookie defensive backs with at least 100 coverage snaps.\n\nOverall, the Bucs pass defense has not been very good, to say the least. It ranks 31 in passing yards allowed, ahead of only the Cowboys. Teams are completing 66.8% of their passes, the seventh-highest percentage in the league.\n\nTheir lack of consistent pressure on the quarterback certainly has been a factor. Outside linebacker Yaya Diaby still leads the team in sacks with six.\n\nBecause Morrison plays best in a man-to-man scheme, the Bucs have struggled at times when they play zone. Couple that with the fact that both Morrison and Parrish could see significant playing time at cornerback against the Panthers.\n\n“It’s a matter of them getting over the rookie slump,” Bowles said. “It’s a long season. It’s probably twice as long as college, and then still maturing and realizing that everybody is going to play injured and hurt, and you’ve got to be mentally tough throughout. I think most of them have done that.”\n\nMorrison said he’s not thinking about how critical the next three games are, with two against the Panthers sandwiched around a game at Miami next week.\n\n“I’m taking them one at a time,” he said. “All I’m thinking about right now is Carolina. I don’t even know who we’re playing the second week or the third week, so just focus on the one we have in front of us.”\n\nThe Bucs sure don’t want to look behind them, having lost five of their past six, including defeats to the Saints and Falcons over a five-day span last week.\n\n“Obviously, we want to get back out there and just get that taste out of our mouths,” Morrison said. “But at the end of the day, we can dwell on it a little bit and give ourselves time to kind of reflect within, figure out what we can do from an individual standpoint, and now we come together as a team. Now we go from there.”\n\nDean recalled his rookie year, when he was pressed into service during a 2019 game at Seattle and allowed three touchdown passes.\n\nWhat can Morrison do to bounce back from some of the big plays he’s allowed this season?\n\n“I just tell them, man, just go out there and play your game,” Dean said. “You got the skill set, because they drafted you in the second round. It’s just a game we’ve been playing since we were a kid. You just keep playing. It’s not like your first time ever experiencing it.”\n\nat Panthers, 1 Sunday TV/radio: Fox; 97.9-FM Line/OU: Bucs by 3; 45 ½\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "fullText": "Although the transfer portal doesn’t open until Jan. 2, the quarterback market is starting to take shape. Multiple high-profile signal-callers announced their plans to hit the portal, and ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported how much the top QBs could make.\n\nThamel reported the “tip-top” of the quarterback market could reach $5 million. For comparison, Duke quarterback Darian Mensah was one of the highest-paid players in the country this past season at $4 million, On3’s Pete Nakos previously reported.\n\nMultiple big-name schools are expected to be looking for a quarterback in the portal this year, and names such as Brendan Sorsby, Dylan Raiola and Josh Hoover are already front-and-center. As a result, the market could surge, Thamel said.\n\n“This market looks robust already, guys. … I made some calls today. Sources told me the tip-top of this quarterback market, financially, could reach $5 million for one season,” Thamel said Friday on ESPN College GameDay. “Look, it’s supply and demand. You have all those guys. Sorsby’s been linked early to Texas Tech. Dylan Raiola, there’s some smoke to Louisville, although maybe a playoff team jumps in late there. There’s been early links between Indiana and Hoover, assuming that [Fernando] Mendoza goes pro.\n\n“Look, this is what’s going to drive the market. Oregon may lose Dante Moore, Miami’ll be in the quarterback market, so will LSU. So when you really take a look at what’s going to drive this quarterback market, it’s going to be the most expensive in the history of college football.”\n\nQuarterback remains one of the biggest positions in the transfer portal, especially considering the recent success. Seven of the last nine Heisman Trophy winners have been transfers, including Mendoza this year. DeVonta Smith and Bryce Young are the only ones to stay with their own program at Alabama and win the award during that time.\n\nLast year’s transfer quarterbacks were also among the highest-paid players in college football, On3 previously reported. Mensah’s $4 million payday was part of a two-year, $8 million deal at Duke. At Miami, Carson Beck inked a deal worth between $3 and $3.2 million, but up to $6 million with incentives.\n\nThe NCAA transfer portal window officially opens Jan. 2, meaning that’s when players’ names will start to appear. It will stay open for two weeks, closing Jan. 16.",

    "fullText": "Caroline Dubois produced a commanding performance on her American debut, outpointing Camilla Panatta to retain her WBC lightweight title in Miami.\n\nThe 24-year-old Londoner boxed with patience and control, showcasing her superior speed, timing and ring intelligence at the Kaseya Center.\n\nDubois dropped Panatta with a beautifully timed counter right in the sixth round before going on to win the 10-round contest by unanimous decision,\n\nAll three judges scored it 99-90.\n\n\"I felt like I could have done a little bit more, I give myself a B\", Dubois said, perhaps harsh in her own assessment.\n\nDubois was fighting for the first time under new promoters Most Valuable Promotions and on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's heavyweight bout against Jake Paul.\n\nShe extends her professional record to 12 wins and one draw, handing Panatta a third defeat in 12 fights.\n\nDubois fought early in the night on the prelims in front of a lightly filled Kaseya Center - the 20,000-seat home of the Miami Heat.\n\nShe walked to the ring singing along to Whitney Houston's 'I'm Every Woman' and started confidently, moving in and out of range and repeatedly beating Panatta to the punch.\n\nA straight left from the champion's southpaw stance landed cleanly and regularly in the third round as the gap in class became increasingly clear.\n\n\"Lovely, Caroline, keep going,\" shouted stablemate and former cruiserweight world champion Chris Billam-Smith from the crowd as Dubois pressed forward.\n\nDubois whipped a body shot into Panatta's midriff in the fifth and again in the sixth, each drawing nods of approval from ringside.\n\nMoments later came the knockdown. As Panatta dipped to attack the body, Dubois slipped the shot and fired a perfectly timed counter to the chin.\n\nPanatta, 34, crashed to the canvas in a heap.\n\nShe rose quickly but looked shaken; her brief grin doing little to disguise the effect of the punch.\n\nWith little time left in the round, Panatta managed to see out the bell.\n\nDubois increased the intensity in the closing stages, varying her work by mixing jabs and uppercuts, while a marked-up Panatta had few answers as the champion comfortably closed out the final rounds.\n\nIt meant there was little doubt when the scorecards were read out.\n\nDubois' move to MVP could prove pivotal in how quickly her career and profile now accelerates.\n\nThe promotional outfit, headed by Paul and CEO Nakisa Bidarian, has invested heavily in women's boxing and, after a period in which Dubois' progress threatened to stall, new opportunities are likely to open up.\n\nShe exchanged words with American super-featherweight champion Alycia Baumgardner at Wednesday's news conference, a potential future bout that would generate significant interest.\n\n\"Not next, but definitely down the line,\" Dubois said of Baumgardner.\n\nA unification fight with Doncaster's Terri Harper - the WBO champion and also signed to MVP - appears a realistic next step.\n\nElsewhere in the division, WBA champion Stephanie Han and Turkey's IBF title holder Elif Nur Turhan, who has eight knockouts in 12 wins, offer unification possibilities.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Prototaxites was an extinct lineage of multicellular terrestrial eukaryotes. Prototaxites was the first giant organism to live on the terrestrial surface, reaching sizes of 8 metres in the Early Devonian.\n\nHowever, its taxonomic assignment has been debated for over 165 years. Tentative assignments to groups of multicellular algae or land plants have been repeatedly ruled out based on anatomy and chemistry resulting in two major alternatives: Prototaxites was either a fungus or a now entirely extinct lineage.\n\nRecent studies have converged on a fungal affinity. Here we test this by contrasting the anatomy and molecular composition of Prototaxites with contemporary fungi from the 407-million-year-old Rhynie chert.\n\nWe report that Prototaxites taiti was the largest organism in the Rhynie ecosystem and its anatomy was fundamentally distinct from all known extant or extinct fungi. Furthermore, our molecular composition analysis indicates that cell walls of P. taiti include aliphatic, aromatic, and phenolic components most similar to fossilisation products of lignin, but no fossilisation products characteristic of chitin or chitosan, which are diagnostic of all groups of extant and extinct fungi, including those preserved in the Rhynie chert.\n\nWe therefore conclude that Prototaxites was not a fungus, and instead propose it is best assigned to a now entirely extinct terrestrial lineage.\n\nPrototaxites taiti material from the Rhynie chert. a-c, Images of two of the four thin sections containing the fragments that constitute the P. taiti type material, including medullary spots (b) and peripheral region (c). d-l: P. taiti material used in this study. d,e: d, Lyon 156 with P. taiti highlighted in dashed lines. e, thin section produced from the block in (d) showing the fractured P. taiti specimen. f, Magnified image of the thin section in (e) showing the characteristic tubes and medullary spots of P. taiti. g, h: g, thin section made from Lyon 48 with P. taiti in dashed box. h, detail of thin section in (g) showing the tubes. i m: Imaging and reconstruction of a large, exceptionally well-preserved P. taiti from NSC.36. i, Photogrammetry model of NSC.36 before cutting with surface exposed P. taiti circled by dashed line. j, Photogrammetry model of NSC.36 after initial cutting of the block with P. taiti circled by a dashed line. k, Block of NSC.36 from which thin sections were produced, showing medullary spots throughout the body. l, thin section taken from the block in (k) showing characteristic tubes and medullary spots of P. taiti. m, Artist reconstruction of P. taiti within the Rhynie ecosystem including hypothesised reconstruction of the aerial portion.

    "title": "LG TVs' unremovable Copilot shortcut is the least of smart TVs' AI problems",
    "description": "LG says it’ll let people delete the Copilot icon. But TV chatbots aren’t going away.",
    "fullText": "Online fury erupted this week after an LG TV owner claimed that a firmware update installed unremovable generative AI software on their smart TV.\n\nThe controversy began on Saturday, when a Reddit user posted about the sudden appearance of a Microsoft Copilot icon on their device (something Windows users are all too familiar with). The Reddit user claimed that a “new software update installed Copilot” onto their LG TV and that it couldn’t be deleted.\n\n“Pre-installed crap is universally dogshit. If I wanted it, I’d have installed it myself eventually. The whole reason it’s bundled is because no one would choose it… Burn your television,” another Reddit user responded in the thread, which has 36,000 upvotes as of this writing.\n\nSome news outlets covered the move this week, reporting that LG customers were upset by an “unremovable Microsoft Copilot installation” and that other LG TV owners could expect to get it the next time they update their device.\n\nLG has since admitted that it used a webOS update to force Copilot onto some of its TVs. However, the firmware update didn’t install the Copilot application but rather a shortcut to the Copilot web app, which opens in the TV’s integrated web browser, LG spokesperson Chris De Maria told The Verge. De Maria added that “features such as microphone input are activated only with the customer’s explicit consent.”\n\nLG’s spokesperson said the company added the “shortcut icon to enhance customer accessibility and convenience.” LG, like other companies, has failed to prove why people need their non-computing devices, such as computer mice or earbuds, to provide instant access to third-party chatbots.\n\nFor those annoyed about the web app shortcut, De Maria said today that LG “will take steps to allow users to delete the shortcut icon if they wish.” He didn’t provide more details.\n\nEven with LG’s concession, it may become more difficult to avoid chatbots on TVs.\n\nLG says it will let people delete the Copilot icon from their TVs soon, but it still has plans to weave the service throughout webOS. The Copilot web app rollout seems to have been a taste of LG’s bigger plans to add Copilot to some of its 2025 OLED TVs. In a January announcement, LG said Copilot will help users find stuff to watch by “allowing users to efficiently find and organize complex information using contextual cues.” LG also said Copilot would “proactively” identify potential user problems and offer “timely, effective solutions.”\n\nSome TVs from LG’s biggest rival, Samsung, have included Copilot since August. Owners of supporting 2025 TVs can speak to Copilot using their remote’s microphone. They can also access Copilot via the Tizen OS homescreen’s Apps tab or through the TVs’ Click to Search feature, which lets users press a dedicated remote button to search for content while watching live TV or Samsung TV Plus. Users can also ask the TV to make AI-generated wallpapers or provide real-time subtitle translations.\n\nCopilot similarly rolled out automatically onto supporting Samsung TVs. Users can avoid Copilot by not using the above features, and they may be able to remove the Copilot icon from their TV’s Apps section.\n\nBut Copilot will still be integrated into Tizen OS, and Samsung appears eager to push chatbots into TVs, including by launching Perplexity’s first TV app. Amazon, which released Fire TVs with Alexa+ this year, is also exploring putting chatbots into TVs.\n\nAfter the backlash LG faced this week, companies may reconsider installing AI apps on people’s smart TVs. A better use of large language models in TVs may be as behind-the-scenes tools to improve TV watching. People generally don’t buy smart TVs to make it easier to access chatbots.\n\nBut this development is still troubling for anyone who doesn’t want an AI chatbot in their TV at all.\n\nSubtle integrations of generative AI that make it easier for people to do things like figure out the name of “that movie” may have practical use, but there are reasons to be wary of chatbot-wielding TVs.\n\nChatbots add another layer of complexity to understanding how a TV tracks user activity. With a chatbot involved, smart TV owners will be subject to complicated smart TV privacy policies and terms of service, as well as the similarly verbose rules of third-party AI companies. This will make it harder for people to understand what data they’re sharing with companies, and there’s already serious concern about the boundaries smart TVs are pushing to track users, including without consent.\n\nChatbots can also contribute to smart TV bloatware. Unwanted fluff, like games, shopping shortcuts, and flashy ads, already disrupts people who just want to watch TV.\n\nLG’s Copilot web app is worthy of some grousing, but not necessarily because of the icon that users will eventually be able to delete. The more pressing issue is the TV industry’s shift toward monetizing software with user tracking and ads.\n\nIf you haven’t already, now is a good time to check out our guide to breaking free from smart TV ads and tracking.",

    "fullText": "Let's set the stage a bit here. Imagine you're a solo dev who has that next big idea that's 100% very obviously going to change and revolutionize your industry. You for sure see patterns nobody else does, and you're determined to use a tool like Claude Code or Codex to vibe out a NextJS application that will definitely make you a million...no a billionaire.\n\nYou spin up your preferred terminal, type in claude or codex and speak your encantation into existence with:\n\nMake me a NextJS application that {insert revolutionary idea and goal}\n\nInstant profit right? Except that's not what happens. What happens is that you spend the next month trying to bring the initial output into a state where you can maybe even call it an MVP. You haven't even added two factor auth at this point, or added a single integration, and this is all due to one very common problem with vibe-coding. It's ham-fisted and ineffective.\n\nDelusions of grandeur aside, the draw of LLM-assisted development is am alluring one, and we'd be lying if we told you it's all just smoke and mirrors. There are some pre-experienced developers (Like us), who are building some incredibly complicated software with the help of LLMs such as Anthropic Claude and OpenAI Codex.\n\nSo what sets these development ventures apart from \"vibe-coders\"? At the core, it's planning. We all know about the trusty dusty agents.md file. I'm sure every marketing and rev ops professional in the world thought they we're Einstien the first time they discovered what a system prompt was. Yeah I'm speaking to you {anonymousId_123456} 😉. The agents.md file is really really neat headpats, but I promise there's a reason you haven't been able to replace your 30+ third-party vendors with Microsoft Copilot in a day. It's because you haven't taken the time to do things like:\n\nHaving even a foundational understanding of type theory and why it's important can be the difference in a successful LLM-assisted greenfield project and a failed experiment. We don't like failed experiments so we're going to give you the step by step into how we build projects here at Atelier Logos. We don't use tools like Github Spec-kit ourselves, but it's a great resource regardless.\n\nWe're perpetually amazed at how many Marketing Ops professionals out here who seem to just forget every bit of their foundational understanding of data structures when they open up an LLM tool. It's like we think just because it's \"AI\", it doesn't need structure (Remember guys, Terminator isn't real) and will just spit out whatever we want. Anytime we start a project, we first define the types and data model. This part doesn't even have to be done by hand, we use LLMs to draft the initial data model quite often.\n\nHere's an example binary.ts from our Fugu project which helps define a structure for binary analysis:\n\nAnyone who's done anything related to deconstructing binaries before knows that it's not an easy task. Granted, we used a OSS tool called Angr to help with a good portion of the legwork, but even then, we needed to define the structure so we could feed the output of Fugu/Angr CLI into our client application from the Rust side. You can see the results here.\n\nThe beauty of having strong typings with Typescript or Rust is that the LSP in a agentic IDE with automatically pick up when something is off and with the right model, automatically compensate for the typing structure you have. Without strong typings, the LLM has the potential to miss large swaths of structural issues in your code during it's iterations.\n\nOnce we nail down a schema, we plan out a directory structure that we can use as a sortof starter suggestion to an LLM tool such as Claude, and then we stub critical functionality such as helper functions, services files, and often we bring in our UI components in advance as well (We use ShadCN and 21st.dev pretty much exclusively).\n\nAfter we have a directory structure nailed down, we're ready to start banging out some initial prompt iterations and see the magic happen. What's amazing about this approach compared to \"vibe-coding\" is that our structure is already there, so the LLM has a lot less \"guessing\" it has to do to achieve optimal results. This is what will always set real developers using LLM tools apart from vibe coders, because now we can feed our types.ts schema into Claude Code for example, or use our directory structure with stubs inside as context for OpenAI Codex.\n\nAnd from here, it's just a matter of mixing and balancing our own intuition with the assistance of our chosen LLM tools.\n\nThe ability to iterate and iterate well with LLM-assisted software development is exponentially greater when you have a defined set of criteria, and you leave as little for the LLM to guess on as possible, while also allowing the agent to take advantage of types via the LSP to automatically fix structural issues.\n\nIf you'd like us to explore how we can use this approach to help you develop internal tools for your organization, schedule a time to chat with James today.",

    "title": "Wow! Signal",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal detected on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, then used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and bore expected hallmarks of extraterrestrial origin.\n\nAstronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. On the computer printout, he circled the reading of the signal's intensity, \"6EQUJ5\", and wrote the comment \"Wow!\" beside it, leading to the event's widely used name.[2]\n\nThe entire signal sequence lasted for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it. Despite numerous follow-up searches and hypotheses (including brief consideration of reflections from space debris, interstellar scintillation, and comet hydrogen clouds), the signal has never recurred, and no explanation, terrestrial or otherwise, has been confirmed. While some researchers have suggested it could represent an extraterrestrial transmission, its single occurrence and lack of replication limit the strength of this interpretation. The Wow! signal has inspired targeted searches, scientific discussion about rare astrophysical phenomena, and references in popular culture.\n\nIn a 1959 paper, Cornell University physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi had speculated that any extraterrestrial civilization attempting to communicate via radio signals might do so using a frequency of 1420 megahertz (21-centimeter spectral line), which is naturally emitted by hydrogen, the most common element in the universe and therefore likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.[3]\n\nIn 1973, after completing an extensive survey of extragalactic radio sources, Ohio State University assigned the now-defunct Ohio State University Radio Observatory (nicknamed \"Big Ear\") to the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), in the longest-running program of this kind in history.[4] The radio telescope was located near the Perkins Observatory on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio.[5]\n\nThe event was later documented in technical detail by the observatory's director.[6]\n\nThe string 6EQUJ5, commonly misinterpreted as a message encoded in the radio signal, represents in fact the signal's intensity variation over time, expressed in the particular measuring system adopted for the experiment. The signal itself appeared to be an unmodulated continuous wave, although any modulation with a period of less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable.[7][8]\n\nThe signal intensity was measured as signal-to-noise ratio, with the noise (or baseline) averaged over the previous few minutes. The signal was sampled for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. The result for each frequency channel was output on the printout as a single alphanumeric character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a dimensionless multiple of the signal's standard deviation.[9]\n\nIn this particular intensity scale, a space character denoted an intensity between 0 and 1, that is between baseline and one standard deviation above it. The numbers 1 to 9 denoted the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1 to 9); intensities of 10 and above were indicated by a letter: \"A\" corresponded to intensities between 10 and 11, \"B\" to 11 to 12, and so on. The Wow! signal's highest measured value was \"U\" (an intensity between 30 and 31), which is thirty standard deviations above background noise.[2][9]\n\nJohn Kraus, the director of the observatory, gave a value of 1420.3556 MHz in a 1994 summary written for Carl Sagan.[6] However, Ehman in 1998 gave a value of 1420.4556±0.005 MHz.[10] This is (50±5 kHz) above the hydrogen line value (with no red- or blue-shift) of 1420.4058 MHz. If due to blue-shift, it would correspond to the source moving about 10 km/s (6.2 mi/s) towards Earth.\n\nAn explanation of the difference between Ehman's value and Kraus's can be found in Ehman's paper. The first local oscillator in the telescope's radio receiver was specified to a frequency value of 1450.4056 MHz. However, the university's purchasing department made a typographical error in the order form, instead obtaining an oscillator with frequency 1450.5056 MHz (i.e., 0.1 MHz higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.[citation needed]\n\nThe Wow! signal had a bandwidth of less than 10 kHz. It is considered narrowband emission in the sense that its fractional bandwidth was relatively small (~0.001%). However, the 10 kHz bandwidth is not small compared to the bandwidth of some astrophysical masers (~1 kHz) or to the frequency resolution of modern narrowband SETI searches (~1 Hz).[11] The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty 10 kHz-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.[10]\n\nAt the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for altitude (or height above the horizon), and relied on the rotation of the Earth to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.[12] A continuous extraterrestrial signal, therefore, would be expected to register for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded intensity of such signal would display a gradual increase for the first 36 seconds—peaking at the center of the observation window—and then a gradual decrease as the telescope moved away from it. All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.[13][14]\n\nThe precise location in the sky where the signal apparently originated is uncertain due to the design of the Big Ear telescope, which featured two feed horns, each receiving a beam from slightly different directions, while following Earth's rotation. The Wow! signal was detected in one beam but not in the other, and the data was processed in such a way that it is impossible to determine which of the two horns received the signal.[15] There are, therefore, two possible right ascension (RA) values for the location of the signal (expressed below in terms of the two main reference systems):[16]\n\nIn contrast, the declination was unambiguously determined to be as follows:\n\nThe galactic coordinates for the positive horn are l=11.7°, b=−18.9°, and for the negative horn l=11.9°, b=−19.5°, both being therefore about 19° toward the southeast of the galactic plane, and about 24° or 25° east of the Galactic Center. The region of the sky in question lies northwest of the globular cluster M55, in the constellation Sagittarius, roughly 2.5 degrees south of the fifth-magnitude star group Chi Sagittarii, and about 3.5 degrees south of the plane of the ecliptic. The closest easily visible star is Tau Sagittarii.[17]\n\nInitially, no nearby Sun-like stars were known to lie within the antenna coordinates, although in any direction the antenna pattern would encompass about six distant Sun-like stars as estimated in 2016.[7] In 2022, a paper published in the International Journal of Astrobiology identified three likely Sun-like stars within the antenna-pointed coordinates. The better characterized star, 2MASS 19281982-2640123, is located 1,800 light years away, only 132 light years away from Maccone's estimation where an intelligent civilization is more likely to exist.[18] The other two candidates, 2MASS 19252173-2713537 and 2MASS 19282229-2702492, were insufficiently characterized but still likely to be Sun-like stars. Also, 14 other catalogued stars at the antenna coordinates may still turn out to be similar to the Sun after more data becomes available.[19][20][21] As a response to the discovery, Breakthrough Listen conducted the first targeted search for the Wow! Signal in its first collaboration between the Green Bank Telescope and the Allen Telescope Array of the SETI Institute.[22][23] The observations were performed on May 21, 2022, lasting 1 hour from Greenbank, 35 minutes from ATA, and 9 minutes and 40 seconds simultaneously.[24] No technosignature candidates were found.[25]\n\nInterstellar scintillation of a weaker continuous signal—similar in effect to atmospheric twinkling—could be an explanation, but that would not exclude the possibility of the signal being artificial in origin. The significantly more sensitive Very Large Array did not detect the signal, and the probability that a signal below the detection threshold of the Very Large Array could be detected by the Big Ear due to interstellar scintillation is low.[26][failed verification] Other hypotheses include a rotating lighthouse-like source, a signal sweeping in frequency, or a one-time burst.[16]\n\nEhman said in 1994: \"We should have seen it again when we looked for it 50 times. Something suggests it was an Earth-sourced signal that simply got reflected off a piece of space debris.\"[27] He later somewhat recanted his skepticism, after further research showed the unrealistic requirements that a space-borne reflector would need to have to produce the observed signal.[10]\nThe signal's frequency of 1420 MHz is also part of a protected spectrum:[28][29] a frequency range reserved for astronomical research in which terrestrial transmissions are forbidden, although a 2010 study documented several instances of terrestrial sources either interfering from adjacent frequency bands or illegally transmitting within the spectrum.[30] In a 1997 paper, Ehman resists \"drawing vast conclusions from half-vast data\"—acknowledging the possibility that the source may have been military or otherwise a product of Earth-bound sources.[31] In a 2019 interview with John Michael Godier, Ehman stated: \"I'm convinced that the Wow! signal certainly has the potential of being the first signal from extraterrestrial intelligence.\"[32]\n\nMETI president Douglas Vakoch told Die Welt that any putative SETI signal detections must be replicated for confirmation, and the lack of such replication for the Wow! signal means it has little credibility.[33]\n\nIn August 2024, the Planetary Habitability Laboratory published a preprint reporting observations made in 2020 at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico—where they conclude that the Wow! signal was likely caused by a rare astrophysical event, in which stellar emissions energizing a cold hydrogen cloud caused it to suddenly surge in brightness.[34][35]\n\nIn 2017, Antonio Paris, Assistant Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at St. Petersburg College, Florida,[36] proposed that the hydrogen cloud surrounding two comets, 266P/Christensen and 335P/Gibbs, now known to have been in the same region of the sky, could have been the source of the Wow! signal.[37][38][39] This hypothesis was dismissed by astronomers, including members of the original Big Ear research team, as the cited comets were not in the beam at the correct time. Furthermore, comets do not emit strongly at the frequencies involved, and there is no explanation for why a comet would be observed in one beam but not in the other.[40][41][42]\n\nSeveral attempts were made by Ehman and other astronomers to recover and identify the signal. The signal was expected to occur three minutes apart in each of the telescope's feed horns, but that did not happen.[14] Ehman unsuccessfully searched for recurrences using Big Ear in the months after the detection.[26]\n\nIn 1987 and 1989, Robert H. Gray searched for the event using the META array at Oak Ridge Observatory, but did not detect it.[26][43][page needed] In a July 1995 test of signal detection software to be used in its upcoming Project Argus, SETI League executive director H. Paul Shuch made several drift-scan observations of the Wow! signal's coordinates with a 12-meter radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, also achieving a null result.\n\nIn 1995 and 1996, Gray again searched for the signal using the Very Large Array, which is significantly more sensitive than Big Ear.[26][43][page needed] Gray and Simon Ellingsen later searched for recurrences of the event in 1999 using the 26-meter radio telescope at the University of Tasmania's Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory.[44] Six 14-hour observations were made at positions in the vicinity, but nothing like the Wow! signal was detected.[14][43][page needed]\n\nIn 2012, on the 35th anniversary of the Wow! signal, the Arecibo Observatory was said to have beamed a digital stream towards Hipparcos 34511, 33277, and 43587.[45] The transmission consisted of approximately 10,000 Twitter messages solicited for the purpose by the National Geographic Channel, bearing the hashtag \"#ChasingUFOs\" (a promotion for one of the channel's TV series).[46] The sponsor also included a series of video vignettes featuring verbal messages from various celebrities.[47] According to Robert Kerr, the former director of the Arecibo Observatory who oversaw the Wow! reply, the transmitter overheated shortly into the first transmission, and it was only sent in the direction of one of the targets. It is unknown how many tweets made it through. None of the targeted stars are within the possible region from which the Wow! signal came.[48]\n\nTo increase the probability that any extraterrestrial recipients would recognize the signal as an intentional communication from another intelligent life form, Arecibo scientists attached a repeating-sequence header to each individual message.[46]\n\nThe signal was featured in the 2024 television series 3 Body Problem, in which the signal is also detected in Inner Mongolia.[49] The signal was also referenced in the 1994 season 2 premier of The X-Files, \"Little Green Men\".",

    "fullText": "Young Brits are souring on the internet, with increasing numbers seeing it as damaging to society and their mental health, according to latest research published by Ofcom.\n\nThe UK's communications regulator found that in June 2025, just a third of those aged 18-34 agreed the internet is good for society, down from 42 percent a year earlier. While this fell for older age groups as well, it did so less sharply (34 percent versus 38 percent in 2024), meaning those aged 55 and above are proportionately more positive than younger people about the internet's impact on civilization.\n\nThe research also found that more young adults disagreed the internet helps their mental health than agreed, reversing the previous year's findings. In June 2025, 35 percent of young adults disagreed that being online had a positive overall effect on their emotional wellbeing, while 31 percent agreed. In June 2024, 28 percent disagreed and 39 agreed.\n\nThe questions were part of annual research carried out in the summer by pollster YouGov with 7,340 adults of all ages for Ofcom's Annual Online Nation report.\n\nDespite their increasing negativity, young adults in the UK spend significantly more time online than older age groups, averaging six hours and 20 minutes a day on personal (rather than work) devices, up ten minutes over the prior 12 months and much higher than the four hours and 30 minutes for all adults.\n\nSo why are many of these digital natives, born between Sir Tim Berners-Lee's creation of the first web browser and server in 1990 and Apple's launch of the first iPhone in 2007, losing faith in the internet?\n\nOne reason may be that their online experiences differ significantly from those of their elders, including more material chosen by algorithms than actively selected by users.\n\nA section of the research on potentially harmful online encounters found younger adults were most likely to have experienced these on Instagram, followed by TikTok. Overall, Facebook was the place people were most likely to encounter such material, but the likelihood of this increased with age. Among all young adults, 47 percent of potentially harmful encounters came from scrolling a feed, compared with just 26 percent for 55s and over.\n\nAnother reason may be increasing interest in how the internet can damage young people, even if this tends to focus on those a bit younger than the group in question.\n\nThis year's Ofcom research took place a few months after the March launch of Adolescence, a UK drama about a teenage murder suspect who was radicalized online, which was Netflix's most-watched show worldwide in the first half of this year. It was also shortly before Ofcom started enforcing the UK's Online Safety Act, which attempts to restrict content for those under 16, and Australia attempted to stop the same age group from operating social media accounts.\n\nOfcom did find that young adults are more likely than older groups to manage their internet use by disabling notifications, using Do Not Disturb settings, pausing use of services, and deleting apps.\n\nA fifth felt they did not have a good balance between online and offline, compared with 13 percent of all adults. However, the group was less likely than older adults to report or flag potentially harmful content, with more than half choosing not to act on this type of material, saying they didn't consider it to be serious or harmful enough. ®",

    "description": "The Kennedy Center added Donald Trump's name to its facade on Friday. Here's a look back at how it came to be and how it has changed under Trump.",
    "fullText": "With his White House renovations already underway, President Donald Trump is now leaving his mark on the Kennedy Center.\n\nThe day after the Kennedy Center's board of trustees voted to change the name, new signage appeared on the building's facade on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\nOriginally established by Congress in 1958 as an \"artistic mecca\" for the performing arts in the nation's capital, the National Cultural Center was officially renamed in memory of President John F. Kennedy after his assassination in 1963. Since its opening in 1971, the center has hosted the Kennedy Center Honors, as well as a range of events and exhibits across genres.\n\nSince the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, changing its name requires congressional approval. That hasn't stopped the Center's Trump-appointed board from implementing the change on the building as well as its website. Whether the name sticks remains to be seen.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how the Center came to be and its changes under Trump's leadership so far.\n\nOriginally named the National Cultural Center, the act authorized the construction of the building and established it as an independent institution with a mission to host arts and culture events, as well as educational programming.\n\nKennedy Onassis and Mamie Eisenhower served as honorary co-chairwomen of the project.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the John F. Kennedy Center Act in January 1964 to change the name and provide $23 million in federal funds for its construction.\n\nAfter signing the bill, Johnson handed the pen to Edward Kennedy, John F. Kennedy's brother.\n\n\"As this center comes to reflect and advance the greatness of America, consider then those glories were purchased by a valiant leader who never swerved from duty — John Kennedy. And in his name I dedicate this site,\" Johnson said at the groundbreaking ceremony, held in December 1964.\n\nDesigned by architect Edward Durell Stone, the Kennedy Center was built on the banks of the Potomac River using 3,700 tons of marble gifted to the US from Italy.\n\nFor its opening event, the Kennedy Center hosted a performance of \"Mass\" by Leonard Bernstein, which was commissioned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nThe first Kennedy Center honorees included Fred Astaire, Marian Anderson, George Balanchine, Arthur Rubinstein, and Richard Rodgers.\n\nBeyoncé brought the Kennedy Center to its feet with a fiery tribute to Tina Turner in 2005, and President Barack Obama shed tears while watching Aretha Franklin perform \"Natural Woman\" to honor Carole King in 2015.\n\nTrump did not attend the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, but has taken a much more active role in shaping the institution in his second non-consecutive term.\n\nAfter taking office earlier this year, he fired the president and Biden-appointed members of the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, replacing them with allies and members of his administration. The board went on to elect Trump as its chairman.\n\nWhile visiting the performance venue in March, Trump told board members that the building was in \"bad shape\" and said he planned to renovate the space.\n\n\"We're going to make a lot of changes, including the seats, the décor, pretty much everything needs a lot of work,\" he said.\n\nAt the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors, held on December 7, honorees received newly designed medallions from Tiffany, featuring blue ribbons instead of the traditional rainbow colors.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House announced that the board had \"unanimously\" voted to change the name from the Kennedy Center to the Trump Kennedy Center, and the website was updated to reflect the change.\n\nTrump's name was added to the building's signage on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\n\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Roma Daravi, the center's vice president of public relations, said in a statement to Business Insider. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"\n\nTrump said he was \"honored,\" while Democratic lawmakers and members of the Kennedy family criticized the president.\n\nKennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, contested the White House's claim of a unanimous vote, writing on X that \"microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous,\" while Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, wrote on X that the change is not acceptable.\n\nSix Democratic lawmakers said in a statement that Trump was \"attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Radio legend Delilah opens up about motherhood, love, and how her callers keep her focused on gratitude and joy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Delilah Rene Luke, voice of the Sonos Holiday Party Prep Talk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up with parents who didn't believe women should work. My mom never held a job outside the house. But like a lot of other values my parents had that I felt were BS, I just did what I was going to do. I was always ambitious and didn't mind what they thought of it.\n\nAt first, being a DJ was a means to an end. I wanted to go to med school, but after failing organic chemistry, I realized medicine wasn't where my gift was. Then, I learned how much one of my professors was making. I was making almost as much, with no education, working a job that I loved. I thought, why not stick with this?\n\nMy definition of success is different from many people. I believe if you love your life and you're kind to people, you are successful. It doesn't matter if you have a degree or a lot of money — if you're not working to make the world a better place, you're not a success in my book.\n\nThere's a song, \"That Don't Impress Me Much.\" Not only does wealth without purpose not impress me — it disgusts me. I prioritize giving back, especially to kids in foster care. I collaborated with Sonos after they made a donation to my charity, PointHope, which supports children in foster care and in African refugee camps. That generosity brings tears to my eyes.\n\nI always wanted a big family, but to me, that means four to six kids. I have 15 now, and my husband has five. Many of them were adopted from foster care. Only two adoptions were planned, but the rest came into my life, and they needed a mother. In one case, I learned my adopted son had biological siblings in foster care who needed a home. Now, I also have 25 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\n\nI want my legacy with them to be love. When I was younger, I thought love was all warm, happy feelings. It's not. Love is saying, \"Yes, I'm going to be there for you through the hard stuff. I'm never going to give up on you or walk away. I'm never going to leave you wondering.\"\n\nThat's the most important thing in life. It's not what you produce, or buy, or what car you drive: it's love.\n\nMy parents always made the holidays super special, even though we didn't have a lot of money. They made most of our gifts, and we cut down our own Christmas tree. If it didn't have enough branches, my dad would drill a hole and stuff more branches in.\n\nI try to make the holidays as special for my kids and grandkids as they were for me. I love baking and crafting (this week I'm painting snowmen for all the kids). My 16-year-old is hosting a holiday sleepover this weekend — her idea, not mine.\n\nI don't worry about everything looking perfect. I don't have anything matching in my house: not matching plates, silverware, or mugs. I prefer plastic plates: there's less to clean up at the end. The one thing that matches — our holiday pajamas! Do you know how hard it is to get 20 pairs of matching pajamas?\n\nAt work, we start working on our holiday show in August or September. If a caller has a particularly great story, I take their number and ask if I can call them back later in the year.\n\nI know if they're articulate about their joy that their child is going to college, they'll have something to be grateful for come Thanksgiving. My callers have shown me that despite all the problems in the world, there's so much to celebrate.",

    "description": "From \"Euphoria\" to \"The Housemaid,\" here are Sydney Sweeney's best and worst movie and TV roles according to critics on Rotten Tomatoes.",
    "fullText": "It may seem like Sydney Sweeney's rise to stardom happened overnight, but the 28-year-old has been acting for most of her life.\n\nSince her first appearance on screen as a scared child in 2010's forgettable \"ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction,\" she's been on the grind, building her credits and landing the occasional guest spot on shows like \"Pretty Little Liars\" and \"The Handmaid's Tale.\"\n\nFinally, she hit it big when she landed role of Cassie Howard in the HBO series \"Euphoria,\" which premiered in 2019. Since then, she's shot up the Hollywood ranks starring in a string of hits, from season one of \"The White Lotus\" to the 2023 hit rom-com \"Anyone But You.\" This year, she physically transformed for the boxing biopic \"Christy,\" and can next be seen starring alongside Amanda Seyfried in the big screen adaptation of Freida McFadden's book \"The Housemaid.\"\n\nBelow, a look at Sydney Sweeney's best and worst movie and TV credits, according to the critic scores on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nAll scores are accurate as of publication but are subject to change.\n\nSweeney tried to get a piece of the Marvel pie by starring opposite Dakota Johnson in this Spider-Women origin story.\n\nBut with disastrous box office and even worse reviews, all involved moved on.\n\nHistorically, rom-coms don't connect with critics, and this one is no different.\n\nHowever, box office doesn't lie; the combination of Sweeney and Glen Powell caused a sensation.\n\nThough it was directed by Ron Howard and stars Jude Law, Vanessa Kirby, and Ana de Armas, this true-life thriller in which Sweeney plays one of the original settlers of Floreana Island, in the Galápagos Islands, didn't connect with critics.\n\nIf Sweeney was excited to be cast in director David Robert Mitchell's follow-up to his hit 2014 horror movie \"It Follows,\" that likely dissipated when she saw that her name on the cast list was \"Shooting Star #2.\"\n\nShe had almost zero screen time and played an escort.\n\nSweeney landed a solid performance in this trippy drama — though you likely didn't see it, as it was released during the height of COVID.\n\nIn this thriller from Blumhouse, Sweeney stars alongside Madison Iseman as twins who get competitive when one outshines the other while attending a prestigious school for classical musicians.\n\nThis modern-day Western crime thriller with Tarantino and Coen brothers vibes stars Sweeney as a waitress with aspirations of being a country singer. She teams with a friend (Paul Walter Hauser) to try to steal a rare Native American artifact. But things get complicated when others also try to get their hands on it.\n\nThis outlandish low-budget horror movie marks Sweeney's screen debut. It's quite memorable, as her one scene in the movie ends with her getting blindsided by an SUV.\n\nSweeney goes all in playing former pro boxer Christy Martin and delivers a believable performance. Though critics were mixed, the movie has only made around $2 million at the box office. That won't get it done when you're looking for awards consideration.\n\nWith \"Immaculate,\" Sweeney chose the right horror movie this time. Here, she plays an American nun who travels to a remote Italian convent, where she endures horrific terrors.\n\nBefore \"Euphoria,\" Sweeney thought this Netflix teen series, in which she played moody drama club member Emaline, would be her big break. Though the series had strong reviews, the streamer scrapped it after one season.\n\nSweeney stars as a young woman who, looking for a fresh start, takes a job as a live-in maid. But the wealthy couple (Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar) who hired her are harboring some dark and twisted secrets.\n\nSweeney shows up in the finale of season 7 playing a high school friend of Addison (Ava Allan).\n\nIn this indie, Sweeney plays the girlfriend of Pete Davidson's drug-dealing character.\n\nSweeney's role as Cassie Howard in \"Euphoria\" also charts her evolution as an actor. This is most evident in season two, when Cassie steals Nate (Jacob Elordi) from Maddy (Alexa Demie), leading to major drama and one famous tear-filled breakdown. She received an Emmy nomination for her work in season two.\n\nIn season one of the HBO anthology series, Sweeney plays Olivia, a college student who goes on a trip to the luxurious Hawaiian resort with her wealthy family and college friend. She would score another Emmy nomination for her performance.\n\nSweeney appeared in a handful of episodes in season two as the child bride Eden Spencer.\n\nThough the limited series is based on the Gillian Flynn book, Sweeney's character was created for the show.\n\nSweeney plays Alice, the troubled roommate of Amy Adams' character in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nCritics praised Sweeney for her performance as Reality Winner, a former NSA contractor who leaked classified documents about Russian interference in the 2016 US elections to the media.",

    "description": "TikTok's new US joint venture will hand over national-security related tasks to its partners, while ByteDance holds onto key business lines.",
    "fullText": "Is TikTok really selling its US business? Kind of.\n\nTikTok has reached an agreement that would give it a new set of owners in the US as part of a joint-venture agreement. Larry Ellison's Oracle, Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, and private-equity firm Silver Lake are all coming on as managing investors in the US spin-off.\n\nBut how much influence will these investors have over the money-making side of the business? Not much, according to an internal memo TikTok CEO Shou Chew sent to employees on Thursday, viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe new investors will focus on national security-related tasks, such as data management and algorithm training, while TikTok's current owner, ByteDance, will remain in charge of key business lines, including e-commerce and advertising.\n\nHere's what Chew told staff about the arrangement:\n\nAs laid out by Chew, TikTok's new investors aren't going to be in the driver's seat on core business lines like TikTok Shop or ad sales, even if they may still participate in the profits of the business. TikTok global, which will remain under ByteDance, will still run the show.\n\n\"Advertisers will continue to connect with global audiences with no impact,\" Chew also wrote in the memo.\n\nThe setup, which focuses a lot more on national security-related concerns than business tasks, may be why the White House said in September the deal would be valued at $14 billion, far lower than the $50 billion estimate from Morningstar analysts in June. My colleague Peter Kafka previously dug into the TikTok valuation question.\n\nIn the proposed structure of the deal, which Chew said should close in late January, Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX will get a combined 45% stake in the US joint venture. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will grab around 30% ownership, and an unnamed group of new investors will take 5%.\n\nByteDance will maintain ownership of just under 20% of the US business, but retain oversight of the rest of the world and manage TikTok US's e-commerce, advertising, and marketing strategies.\n\nThat sounds like a pretty good setup for a company that spent much of 2024 and 2025 fighting to keep its US business alive after Congress passed a law forcing it to sell its US app or face a potential ban.\n\nThe question of who will actually be in charge of different parts of the business is paramount to employees at TikTok and ByteDance. Will they get a new boss or organizational structure after an agreement closes?\n\n\"Even though there's a deal, it doesn't say concretely yet what it means for us,\" one TikTok staffer said. They added that they weren't anticipating much change.\n\nTikTok, ByteDance, and MGX did not respond to requests for comment. Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment.",

    "title": "I visited the 'Disney World' of truck stops for the sightseeing and food, but discovered a newfound respect for truckers",
    "description": "Iowa 80 in Walcott, Iowa stretches 150 football fields and serves 350,000 meals a year. It's more than just a stop on the road for truckers, though.",
    "fullText": "I've often driven past truckers feeling frustrated by their slow speed or uneasy that one might merge into my lane. I never gave much thought to who was behind the wheel.\n\nHowever, Iowa 80, the world's largest truck stop, cracked my heart open a bit.\n\nIowa 80's been dubbed the \"Disney World\" for truckers, but it's much more than its flashy signs, lines of semis, and large buffet. It's a home away from home for the people who move 70% — $13 trillion worth — of the goods Americans eat and buy.\n\nIowa 80 is a place where truckers can find some temporary peace, a shower, and even a dental exam. I was surprised to learn just how important a truck stop like this can be for people bound to the highways.\n\nIt sits along I-80 in Walcott, Iowa, and spans 225 acres. It has 900 parking spots, nine restaurants, 24 showers, and a massive chrome shop.\n\nIt's not in any world record books, though. After decades of folks saying, \"This has got to be the biggest truck stop in the world,\" the family behind Iowa 80 adopted the name. Now it's on dozens of signs around the property.\n\nIowa 80 is in a prime location, along one of America's busiest highways that connects New York City and Chicago to Des Moines and San Francisco. Plus, as the nation's top producer of corn and eggs, Iowa is a major agricultural shipping hub.\n\nWhat sets this truck stop apart, besides its size, is that it's one of the few mom-and-pop ones still around.\n\nOwned by the Moon family since 1964, Iowa 80 always has parking. Its main restaurant makes a surprising amount of food from scratch. It's a welcome change, truckers told me, from the big chains, like TA or Pilot, which often have full parking lots and fuel stations and only offer fast food to eat.\n\nI knew it was going to be big. But even I had underestimated the size. When I walked in, I thought, 'How on Earth am I going to see it all?'\n\nBig guys with their big gulps parted ways under the old-timey truck hanging over the entrance.\n\nWalking in, it felt like a shopping mall, complete with a food court filled with Orange Julius, Wendy's, and Taco Bell. On the right, the Iowa 80 Kitchen churned out homemade meals that were delicious.\n\nIt's no surprise they're working with a huge quantity of food. In their 61 years, they've gone through 23 million eggs. Bacon is one of the first things to hit the ovens each morning. The staff has to juggle both breakfast and lunch prep early to beat the rush.\n\nFor its size, I expected a lot of the food to be frozen. Indeed, the scrambled eggs and biscuits did arrive pre-cooked and frozen. However, most of the main dishes were cranked out by hand.\n\nChef Chris Han uses her grandfather's recipe for meatloaf, which includes chopped onions, celery, a tomato sauce mixture, breadcrumbs, and ground beef. She incorporates it all together in a 40-year-old mixer.\n\nThe cooks told me they tried to switch to pre-made ranch dressing, but there was an uproar among customers. So they went back to mixing it themselves. Mayo arrives in big buckets. That gets mixed with six gallons of buttermilk and nine packets of ranch seasoning.\n\nDiners have two options at Iowa 80 Kitchen. They can either pay for the buffet for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Or they can order off the expansive menu.\n\nThe Hungryman is a crowd favorite, with three kinds of meat, hash browns, eggs, and pancakes. When it hit my table, I couldn't believe people finish it.\n\nThese are sweet cream pancakes, which means they're made with heavy cream instead of milk or buttermilk. This swap felt like a brilliant indulgence to me.\n\nDespite sitting out for a bit while we took pictures, these pancakes had an incredible crisp on the outside. On the inside, they were still fluffy and almost gooey. I loved the unique tang to them.\n\nThis dish sang of Midwest comfort. I grew up a few hours south of Iowa 80, and it reminded me of my mom's recipe (I plead the fifth on which is better). It was warm, melty, and full of interesting textures, thanks to the breadcrumbs and celery.\n\nThe truckers I spoke to said that it's easy to get obese working as professional drivers. Most truck stops only have fast food options.\n\nThat's why Iowa 80 Kitchen means so much to them. It's a warm, home-cooked meal, they said. I wondered if that sentiment would excuse the few things that arrived frozen.\n\nLee Meier, granddaughter of the founders and the current marketing manager, took me on a tour of the massive truck stop. She explained that they wanted to include all these amenities — like 24 showers, a small gym, a laundry room, and a truck wash — so drivers wouldn't have to do errands in the precious hours they have at home with their families.\n\nWhen we poked our heads in around 2 p.m., there was no one in the 60-seat theatre. Disney's \"Cars\" played to an empty room.\n\nSeeing the movie selection gave me a jolt of excitement and nostalgia. It felt like I was a kid again, looking at that cool friend's massive collection of DVDs. I wanted more than anything to stay and cozy up to a movie.\n\nIt struck me that if a trucker has a toothache, they can't pull their rig into a neighborhood dentist. Which is why a dentist at a truck stop could be so valuable.\n\nI didn't get a chance to talk to the chiropractor, but Lee told me that many drivers experience back pain from being seated for 10 hours a day.\n\nTruckers can get new headlights, fenders, hood ornaments, seats, electronics, and horns. Iowa 80 also has a Truck Service Center that can repair any semi.\n\nAnd for drivers who might need inspiration for decorating their vehicle, there's even a trucking museum on the property, featuring over 100 antique rigs on display.\n\nDrivers told me that just to get some sleep, they have to fight for a parking spot at the most common truck stops, like TA and Pilot, but after 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., it's impossible to find one.\n\nThat's why you'll sometimes see rigs pulled over on the shoulder of a highway onramp to sleep, which can be unsafe if there's heavy traffic.\n\nEven with hundreds of trucks settled in by the time we left at 5 p.m., the lot was nowhere near full. I can see why this is an important feature for tired drivers.",

    "title": "Stagflation will derail one of the biggest drivers of the stock market rally next year, Apollo's top economist says",
    "description": "Stagflation, a scenario where growth is sluggish while inflation remains elevated, is one of the biggest risks the Fed faces in 2026, Apollo said.",
    "fullText": "A top economist is back with a stagflation warning.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said he believes stagflation is still one of the biggest risks facing the Federal Reserve next year, even as investors breathe a sigh of relief after a light November inflation print.\n\nThat risk is jeopardizing a key source of fuel for the stock market rally: the prospect of more rate cuts.\n\n\"I still think that stagflation is a risk because there's still some headwinds coming, especially if AI does not deliver,\" Sløk said, pointing to the downside risks to growth and upside risks to consumer prices heading into the new year.\n\n\"Given that inflation is very sticky and now has the risk of going up over the next six months, then the key issue for the FOMC becomes: can we even cut in that environment?\" he later added.\n\nStagflation, which is often referred to by market pundits as one of the worst-case scenarios for the economy, describes a situation where growth remains sluggish while inflation remains elevated. That's a difficult combo for policymakers to respond to, as hot inflation prevents the Fed from cutting interest rates to boost economic growth.\n\nOn paper, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction. GDP is expected to have expanded a robust 3.5% over the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed economists, while inflation cooled to a 2.7% year-over-year pace, per the November CPI report.\n\nBut the US's vulnerability to stagflation is real, Sløk suggested. He pointed to the risk that AI firms will start to slow their spending on the technology, or that the billions they've already poured into AI won't produce the returns investors are expecting.\n\nMeanwhile, the ISM Services Prices Index, one forward-looking inflation indicator, clocked in at 65.4% in November, well within expansionary territory.\n\nCentral bankers also seem to be worried about stagflation, Sløk said. The number of FOMC members who said they believed the risks to inflation and unemployment were skewed to the upside far outnumbered those who said they believed risks were skewed to the downside, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"In other words, the Fed continues to forecast stagflation and is concerned that we in 2026 may experience rising inflation and rising unemployment at the same time,\" Sløk wrote.\n\n\"The bottom line is, in the next six months, and especially when we get to April, we'll begin to see some fairly meaningful risks that inflation is still going to be elevated,\" he later told CNBC.\n\nThe outlook for rate cuts looks dim heading into the new year. The probability that the Fed will trim rates another 25 basis points in January ticked up following the November CPI report, but investors are largely expecting the central bank to keep rates steady at its next policy meeting, with the odds of a cut at the March meeting at just 45%, per the CME FedWatch tool.",

    "description": "In her new docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" Taylor Swift talks about the beginning of her relationship with Travis Kelce and dating athletes.",
    "fullText": "If pop star Taylor Swift and elite athlete Travis Kelce seem like an unexpected match from the outside, Swift isn't surprised to hear that — she once felt the same way.\n\nIn her Disney+ docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" Swift opens up about the beginning of her relationship with Kelce and why she was initially hesitant to date her now-fiancé.\n\n\"I'd been very non-athlete. Because I'm not one. And I've always just been like, 'Well, what would we talk about?'\" Swift says in episode four, \"Thank You For the Lovely Bouquet.\"\n\nIndeed, Swift says that during her first date with Kelce, \"he literally had to explain football as if it were violent chess, which kind of helped me understand it.\"\n\nSwift also reveals that her mom, Andrea Swift, was the one who encouraged her to give Kelce a chance. Andrea had seen headlines about Kelce attending one of the Eras Tour stops at Arrowhead Stadium, his home field with the Kansas City Chiefs, and saying on his podcast that he'd hoped to meet Swift before the show and give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number.\n\nAndrea says in the docuseries that she was impressed by the \"earnest\" gesture and found it promising that Kelce would engage with the details of Swift's world, like making a friendship bracelet. She asked around about Kelce, and her cousin, a big Chiefs fan, told her that Kelce was known as \"the nicest guy\" who loves his mom.\n\n\"And so you call me up,\" Swift explains, addressing Andrea, \"with this tone of like, 'Hey, I know you're gonna not react well to this. But there's a guy.' You said something to the effect of, 'You've gotta start doing something different.'\"\n\nBefore Kelce, Swift's public relationships were almost always with artist types, usually movie stars or musicians like Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, and Calvin Harris. Most notably, Swift dated British actor Joe Alwyn for about six years. Their split was announced soon after the Eras Tour kicked off in early 2023.\n\nWeeks later, Swift was romantically linked to The 1975 front man Matty Healy. After about one month of public outings and strong objections from Swift's fans, TMZ broke the news that Swift was single again.\n\nSwift released her 11th album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" in 2024. The 31-song tracklist features recurring themes of heartbreak, alienation, and romantic disillusionment. Swift characterizes the album as a \"purge of everything bad that I felt for two years.\"\n\n\"It was a really rough time in my life, so the songs reflect that — feeling like I'm not a person, I'm just like, this big conglomerate that no one sees as a real human being, and especially not men that I date,\" she explains in the docuseries. \"And in the whole process, just being like, 'Nothing works. There is no one for me in the world.'\"\n\n\"I went through two breakups on the first half of this tour,\" she adds, \"and that's a lot of breakups, actually. The show was what gave me purpose.\"\n\nSwift's latest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" was largely written during the second half of the Eras Tour. It features overt references to her relationship with Kelce, who got down on one knee shortly before the album's release.\n\nDespite Swift's fears that she wouldn't have anything in common with a football player, she now believes her and Kelce's careers are more similar than not.\n\n\"We both have jobs where we go out in NFL stadiums, and we entertain people for three and a half hours,\" Swift says. \"It's our passion. We've been chasing this since we were little kids. I don't think I ever thought I'd meet a guy who had that same trajectory.\"\n\n\"Travis is just very comfortable with, conceptually speaking, a big life,\" she adds. \"Because he has one, and it's not one that he has reluctantly.\"\n\nIn the final scene of episode four, Kelce is shown waiting below the stage for Swift to finish one of her concerts. They kiss and leave the stadium together while Swift, in a voiceover, reflects on their unlikely match-up: \"If you ever would've told me that the most meaningful relationship I would ever have would start with a man saying that he was 'butthurt' that I didn't want to meet him — like, unbelievable. Unbelievable.\"",

    "fullText": "The Justice Department has officially released documents on Jeffrey Epstein, the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nFriday's disclosure is the first of what are expected to be several rounds of document releases over the coming weeks as the DOJ scrambles to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in November.\n\nThe documents contain a trove of photos, some of which feature famous names such as former President Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those connections and law enforcement's handling of the case.\n\nSo what else do the latest Epstein files contain? Business Insider reporters have begun looking through the documents and photos and we'll be reporting out highlights as they're discovered.\n\nA bipartisan duo of House lawmakers responsible for pushing the Epstein files bill through Congress is displeased with the Justice Department's release of documents thus far and publicly proposing remedies.\n\n\"Unfortunately, today's document release by @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlanche grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago,\" Rep.

Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said it was unacceptable that many documents remain redacted, despite the law allowing only narrow exceptions and requiring explanations for such redactions. He threatened the possibility of impeachment if Justice Department officials do not comply, though such action would require at least some Republican support.\n\n\"Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options,\" Khanna said in a video posted on X. \"It can be the impeachment of people at Justice, inherent contempt, or referring for prosecution those who are obstructing justice.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Epstein's longtime friend and sex trafficking accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, features heavily in the files dropped on Friday. The files include photos of them traveling together and her dressed up in a uniform.\n\nThe daughter of a British media Tycoon, Maxwell was a constant presence in Epstein's life over the decades. The two were even romantically involved at one point.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year sentence at a minimum-security federal prison in Texas for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking operation.Read full story\n\nSome redactions to the files are drawing ire online.\n\n\"Breaking News: The Epstein Files,\" wrote Julie K.

One collection of photos included a series of nude photographs, redacted so as not to be explicit.\n\nOther images appear to be from Epstein's Manhattan home, including photos of his bedroom, risque wall art, what appeared to be an effigy hanging from the staircase, and a taxidermied tiger.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is the most transparent in history. By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have. And while President Trump is delivering on his promises, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender. The American people deserve answers.\" Abigail Jackson WH spokeswoman\n\nThe DOJ added several warning notices about its Epstein documents.

We've seen titans of industry like Richard Branson, Bill Gates, and Sergey Brin.\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\n\"The Trump administration can't move the goalposts. They're cemented in law,\" Schiff added.\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law on November 19, states that the documents can be released no \"later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\" According to the law, the attorney general needs to \"make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nIn 2019, ahead of Epstein's arrest and suicide, Steve Bannon filmed what he said were 15 hours of interviews with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThat footage has remained under wraps. If the footage was on Epstein's hard drives, however, the DOJ might have obtained it when the FBI seized his electronic devices around the time of his arrest on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nRecently released text messages between Epstein and Bannon have shed some light on the project, which was intended to be a promotional documentary to burnish Epstein's reputation.\n\nRead that story here:Read full story\n\nJustice Department officials told multiple news outlets earlier today that the files will be released at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThe DOJ has now missed that deadline.

By law, it has until midnight tonight to release all of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhile the specifics of what will be in the files released on Friday aren't clear, here is some of what is anticipated:\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe White House initially opposed the transparency law until enough Republican lawmakers broke with GOP leadership to join House Democrats, forcing a vote on the bill. After it became clear Congress would move ahead anyway, Trump flipped his stance on the legislation.\n\nDuring Epstein's 2019 arrest, the FBI searched his Manhattan townhouse and his home in the US Virgin Islands. In the process, they obtained more than 70 computers, iPads, and hard drives, along with financial documents and binders full of CDs.\n\nThose seized materials form the heart of the \"Epstein files,\" which could shed even more light on the deepest, darkest secrets of the notorious pedophile.\n\nThose could include more emails and text messages, as well as internal prosecutorial records. The Justice Department has overseen two different criminal investigations into Epstein's sexual abuse of teenage girls. The first took place in Florida and led to a widely criticized plea deal in 2008. The second was the Manhattan-based investigation, which led to Epstein's 2019 arrest and Maxwell's prosecution.\n\n\"We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law,\" Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Robert Garcia of California said in a joint statement. \"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ.\"\n\nRaskin and Garcia serve as the top Democrats on the powerful House Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee, respectively. Since Democrats control neither chamber of Congress, their power to force the immediate disclosure of the documents is more limited.\n\nEarlier today, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department would not meet the legal deadline imposed by bipartisan legislation that President Donald Trump signed into law in November that requires the DOJ to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" regarding Epstein and his conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,\" Blanche said during an interview on Fox News.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein's co-conspirator, was found guilty of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Civil lawsuits involving Epstein, Maxwell, banks affiliated with Epstein, and the US Virgin Islands government have shaken loose even more details about his life. Various drips and drabs have also entered the public domain through Freedom of Information Act requests, government reports, and an inquiry from the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nAll of that may pale in comparison to what the Justice Department has in its possession.\n\nYes. In recent months, the House Oversight Committee has made public Epstein-related documents it obtained through subpoenas, including emails provided by his estate and never-before-seen photos of some of Epstein's powerful acquaintances, including Trump, Bill Gates, Larry Summers, and Steve Bannon.\n\nThose disclosures have already led to some fallout. Summers, a former Treasury Secretary, has been barred from the American Economic Association for life and is no longer teaching classes at Harvard University, pending an investigation.\n\nEpstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. He was known for rubbing elbows with powerful people — even after he was convicted of soliciting sex from a minor in 2008. Over the years, he has counted Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and other titans of finance, law, politics, and science among his acquaintances.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those relationships and law enforcement's handling of the case.",

    "fullText": "UTICA, N.Y. (AP) — A former New York state prison guard convicted of murder for his role in the brutal beating of an inmate that was captured on body-camera footage was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in prison.\n\nDavid Kingsley also received a 25-year sentence for a manslaughter conviction in the case. He is the only former guard convicted of murder in the death of Robert Brooks, who was pummeled by corrections officers on the night of Dec. 9, 2024, at Marcy Correctional Facility. Five other guards charged in the 43-year-old Black man’s death have pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n\nVideo footage of Brooks in handcuffs being punched and stomped by guards triggered widespread shock and calls for reform in New York's prisons. Kingsley was sentenced hours before Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a deal with state lawmakers on prison reforms that include a requirement that cameras be installed in all facilities and that video footage related to deaths behind bars be promptly released to state investigators.\n\nSix guards were indicted by a grand jury for murder charges brought earlier this year by the special prosecutor, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, who also charged four others with lesser crimes. Three of the defendants charged with murder later pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter.\n\nProsecutors said Kingsley deserved the maximum sentence because he refused to take responsibility for his actions and made Brooks' family go through the trauma of a trial. Speaking in court before the sentence was imposed, Kingsley apologized to Brooks' relatives for his role in the “senseless” actions that led to his death.\n\nThe victim’s son, Robert Brooks Jr., said that he hopes the case will prevent similar incidents in the future. Brooks’ brother, Jared Ricks, added that while forgiveness is a long way off, justice being served is a step on that path.\n\nKingsley, 45, was one of three guards tried before a jury in October on charges of murder and first-degree manslaughter. He was the only one of the trio found guilty. Body-camera footage played at the trial showed him holding Brooks by the neck and lifting him as multiple guards surrounded the handcuffed man.\n\nA final defendant is scheduled to stand trial Jan. 12 on a second-degree manslaughter charge. Another guard was released from prison this month as he attempts to withdraw his guilty plea to second-degree manslaughter.\n\nFitzpatrick became the special prosecutor after state Attorney General Letitia James recused herself, citing her office’s representation of several officers in separate lawsuits. He also is prosecuting guards in the fatal beating of Messiah Nantwi on March 1 at a nearby prison, the Mid-State Correctional Facility. Ten guards were indicted in April, including two who are charged with murder, in Nantwi’s death.\n\nThe prisons are about 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of New York City.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is entitled to his $55.8 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, Delaware's Supreme Court ruled.\n\nA Delaware Chancery Court judge struck down the compensation package last year after a Tesla shareholder sued over the massive payday, which was tied to a series of growth goalposts for the EV company.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court's ruling overturns that decision, saying it was too extreme a remedy.\n\nTesla shareholders recently approved an even bigger pay package of up to $1 trillion for Musk if Tesla achieves further sales and growth goals.\n\nThe decision to withhold his 2018 pay package prompted Musk to criticize Delaware on several occasions. Delaware's long-standing reputation for being business-friendly is rooted in the Delaware General Corporation Law, which serves as the foundation of its corporate law.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Musk wrote on X in August 2024.\n\nAt the time, two of Musk's companies — Tesla and SpaceX — were incorporated in Delaware. He moved those companies to Texas in 2024.\n\nDespite Delaware's position as a central incorporation hub, a series of court rulings left some prominent companies wondering if they could find stronger legal protections somewhere else, including VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe firm announced in July that its primary business, AH Capital Management, would no longer be incorporated in Delaware because \"legal uncertainty\" had worried investors and entrepreneurs on its board.\n\n\"As a result, many of the companies we fund and the entrepreneurs that we talk to are taking a second look at whether they should incorporate in other jurisdictions, prompted by the departure from Delaware of significant technology companies like Dropbox, Tripadvisor, and Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog post.\n\nThe firm said it's reincorporating in Nevada, an increasingly popular alternative.\n\nBusinesses incorporated in Delaware account for a large chunk of the state's revenue. As of 2024, more than 2.1 million businesses were incorporated in Delaware, meaning a widespread exodus could do serious damage to its economy.\n\nEven so, Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider that officials aren't spooked by the \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business,\" she said.\n\nPatibanda-Sanchez added: \"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way. We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "fullText": "on December 19, 2025 at 11:47AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThis may seem unimaginable for gamers of a certain age, but once upon a time, the best and most reliable way to try out a game before it launched was by going directly to an Electronics Boutique, a KB Toys, or any major department store with an electronics department, and playing it on a kiosk. And as a gamer of that certain age, this was exactly how I played Super Nintendo and Game Boy games for years, long before my mother could afford to buy us either (during the console wars, we were staunchly in the Sega camp). It was perfect. We would go to Sears, mom would go buy her clothes and various things for the house, and I and/or my best friend would hang out and play Mario Land, Mario World, or Donkey Kong Country for an hour at a mostly empty kiosk.\n\nAnd then there was the weekend that there was a crowd. The Nintendo kiosk was gone, and in its place was something gray and alien. And there were dozens huddled around it. We got closer, and we found out why: It was a kiosk for something called a PlayStation, and the screen showed a fighting game made up of polygons moving in and around the background in 3D. And a crowd of people were beholding their first glimpse of the future.\n\nOn September 9, 1995, the original PlayStation was released in North America, and a new era of gaming had finally begun. But for many folks at the time, that new era had a herald. The hardcore folks who preordered the PS1 got the fancier disc with the T-Rex tech demo, but much of the general public got their first taste of the PS1 with the PlayStation Picks disc, which came bundled with the console at launch and was playing non-stop on kiosks across America. These were the games and demo videos meant to sell the PS1 to the unconverted, the ambassadors Sony would send to show the world pixels were on notice, polygons were the way forward.\n\nWhat's fascinating now, though, is looking at that roster of games and comparing it to the games people call out in 2025 as the games that defined the era, at least in the way early-adopter killer-app titles like the original Super Mario Bros did for the NES, Altered Beast and Revenge of Shinobi did for the Genesis, or Mario World and F-Zero did for the SNES. While the PlayStation all-stars (no, not those ones) on that disc are easy to account for (Twisted Metal, Tekken, Wipeout, Air Combat), there are 12 games represented on that disc--eight preview videos, and four playable demos--and not all of them are as widely remembered as, say, Tekken or Ridge Racer. So, what exactly happened to the PlayStation class of 1995? Some went on to be all-time classics, while others, not so much. Let's go through them, one by one, and find out.\n\nESPN Extreme walked--er, well, biked and luged, really--so that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater could run. Right as \"extreme sports\" was becoming a thing culturally, PlayStation were right there at the forefront with the first game making a solemn attempt to tap in. ESPN Extreme itself owes a lot to EA's Road Rash far as mechanics go--racing but being able to whack people off their vehicles. But where Road Rash was still beholden to leathery biker aesthetics (though the 3DO/Sega CD ports did inject grunge back into the mix), throwing roller blading, mountain biking, and street luges in with a punkier soundtrack got it closer to the zeitgeist. That official ESPN X-Games license only helped in that regard.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: After the ESPN license dropped, Sony churned out two more sequels under the names 2Xtreme and 3Xtreme (with the original even getting re-released as 1Xtreme) with more tracks, stages, and official partnership with real-life athletes. Once that third game hit, though, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater basically carried the extreme sports standard forward, and that was that.\n\nAs for the devs, Sony Interactive Studios was, essentially, one of Sony's A-teams in the early days of the PlayStation, either directly developing or helping produce some of the biggest hits of the early days. They'd eventually splinter off and operate as 989 Studios for a while, and while most of their output wound up being Sony's first-party sports titles, their name is on some serious heavy hitters. A couple of those will be showing up later in this list, but a few others include the first two Syphon Filters, JetMoto, and even the first Everquest. They also made Spawn: The Eternal. (We forgive them.) The studio was eventually folded back into being Sony Interactive again in 2005.\n\nJumping Flash is one of the true unsung heroes of the 32-bit era. Folks love to argue about which of the big groundbreaking 3D platformers was best between Nights: Into Dreams, Crash Bandicoot, and Mario 64, but Jumping Flash was first, and while graphically threadbare, it's still best in a few areas. There's nothing terribly special about the plot: An evil real estate mogul named Baron Aloha who looks like a Funko Pop of Ted Turner steals chunks from a planet to develop as exclusive property for himself, and a space council sends a giant, adorable robot rabbit named Robbit to save the world. The core gameplay is little more than a simple collect-a-thon, and yet, that collection is dependent on Robbit making death-defying jumps across wide-open stages, all while using FPS mechanics to take down anything in his way with lasers and fireworks.\n\nMechanically, it plays less like a Mario 64, and more like Baby's First Metroid Prime. Aside from the lack of dual analog stick controls (it was 1995, after all), it's doing so many things other developers wouldn't figure out about running and jumping in 3D for years. The cherry on top is one of the finest soundtracks the PS1 had to offer, which is saying a lot. Spoiler alert, but arguably, this is the title that's held up the best from the PS1's entire launch library, and yet, it's right down there with Philosoma and Kileak as the titles we talk about the least.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Jumping Flash was at least successful enough to warrant a couple of sequels: the equally-as-good Jumping Flash 2 and Robbit Mon Dieu, which never even got a Western release.. According to former Sony Interactive president Shuhei Yoshida, the team behind PS2 launch title Fantavision once tried to grab the license for some sort of PSVR remake of the game, but the project simply fell through. The series has been dead in the water ever since. Though, shout outs to Team Asobi for giving poor, neglected Robbit some love with prominent cameos in Astro's Playroom and 2024's Astro Bot, even putting some extra respect on his name by labeling his VIP Bot in the latter \"A true 3D platforming pioneer.\"\n\nEven though Virtua Fighter had existed for about a year prior to the PlayStation, that series, to this day, has just never caught on in the West the way it's damn near an institution in Japan, at a time when the much flashier Street Fighters and Mortal Kombats ruled arcades. As such, Toshinden very quickly became the de facto ambassador for 3D fighters for quite a lot of folks, and as a first look at 3D graphics in early 1995, it was, for a time, breathtaking. Sure, it almost immediately began to age like a fine milk the second people got their hands on Tekken, but hey, it was also a snazzy, fluid (for the time), stylish 3D weapon-based fighting game with an eclectic roster, at a time when there wouldn't be any legitimate competition in that sphere until Bushido Blade and Soul Edge two years later.\n\nFor a hot second, it even felt like whip-wielding Russian dominatrix Sophia might actually be the game's breakout star. Oh, but nooo, that scene-stealing tramp Lara Croft had to come along a year later and blow up her spot. In 2025, it's a sluggish mess to play, though, still gotta hand it to ‘em that final boss Sho's stage--taking place in front of an ominous Tower of Babel while Bach's Toccata and Fugue plays during a wind storm--is a pure aura farm if ever there was.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Oh, Takara/Tamsoft tried so very hard to milk Toshinden for all it was worth before its 15 minutes were up. The original game got a Remix version on Saturn, and a shockingly great Game Boy port. There were three progressively worse sequels. There was even an anime OVA directed by Masami Obari of Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture fame. But as mentioned, Tekken, Soul Blade, even Virtua Fighter all had juice that Toshinden just didn't, and after those four sequels failed to win any additional hearts and minds, the series has been effectively dead since 1999, and nobody's really clamoring for a comeback.\n\nThe original Wipeout gets a lot right, really. There were lightning fast futuristic racing games before this, but by and large, the future they envisioned looks more like The Jetsons. Wipeout, on the other hand, looked and sounded like the inside of a London rave, 200 years from now, and that phenomenal art direction gave it an older, edgier fanbase than just about anything else on the system at launch. The vibes were absolutely immaculate. The actual game, on the other hand…well, it was fast, certainly, but it was just far too easy in that original game to scrape a wall and have all your momentum grind to a halt, in a way that made it way more unsatisfying than it should've been. These are problems that would be eradicated a year later, when Psygnosis dropped the utterly flawless Wipeout XL, a game so influential it basically kicked the door down for hardcore EDM to become a mainstream genre in the late 90s.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Like EDM itself, Wipeout was never a blockbuster franchise, but the fans who stuck with it remained loyal as hell over the subsequent 30 years. There would be a new title on every PlayStation platform (as well as a just-okay N64 version nobody talks about), each one pushing the envelope of speed to the maximum limit of the hardware. And it would remain like this until Psygnosis--then having changed names to Studio Liverpool--was restructured in 2010, then fully shut down in 2012. The series would, at least, get something of an Irish funeral in 2017 with much of the original team contributing to Wipeout Omega Collection, which remastered tracks from Wipeout HD, Fury, and 2048 into 4K/60fps. But the real kicker was a patch in 2018 which added PSVR support. The game went from being a nice, polished package for the PS4, to one of the most breathtaking, adrenaline-spiking experiences you can have in any VR headset.\n\n….so naturally, the PSVR2 is incompatible with original PSVR titles, and they still haven't given Wipeout a new port, and just what are we even doing with that headset, Sony.\n\nOut of the launch lineup, Destruction Derby is the title that feels the most redundant. Not that it's a bad game, per se. For the time, it was actually one of the more technically impressive titles in the lineup, with the car destruction physics being surprisingly detailed in particular, as well as the fact that you could have almost two dozen cars on the road at one time. Thing is, if you wanted to drive around blowing up cars, Twisted Metal came out a week before this did. If you wanted a straight driving experience, Ridge Racer launched with the console. If you just plain wanted an alternative racing game, Wipeout and ESPN Extreme were there. That didn't stop the game from being a success, but it definitely limited how much of a tail the thing would have after launch.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: The immediate sequel, Destruction Derby 2, was a pretty big improvement, leaning harder into the more southern fried, thrashy chaos vibes demolition derbies have in the U.S. The N64 version was even better still, taking some of the sluggish racing sim controls out of the equation. Real talk, I didn't even realize there was a fourth game on PS1, Destruction Derby Raw, until writing this article. That apparently released in 2000, a month before the PS2 came out, and a general look at the critical reception shows that nobody missed a whole lot. The last game in the series, Destruction Derby Arenas, would release on PS2 in 2004, only notable for being one of the few, proud PS2 games you could play online, but it was completely immemorable otherwise, and Burnout 3: Takedown would eat its lunch in every single aspect later that year.\n\nIn the same way that Tekken would be the PlayStation's answer to Sega's Virtua Fighter, Ridge Racer was their answer to Virtua Racing and Daytona USA. Ridge Racer was faster, cooler, and just saying, one of these games let you play Galaga while the game loaded. Daytona may have had the banger theme song, but the counterpoint is the little secret that because Ridge Racer loaded the entire game while you actually played Galaga, once the game loaded, you could take the disc out, and put in any CD you wanted. If you weren't zooming around tracks to the Mortal Kombat soundtrack in ‘95, you missed a golden opportunity. The point being, while Ridge Racer was a bit basic, the little things added up, and if you just wanted a straightforward racer for PS1, this was an easy, no-brainer purchase.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: You'd think, looking at the series timeline, that Namco had basically put out a new Ridge Racer every six months until about 2012, but in reality, a lot of what passes for new releases in Ridge Racer are the types of updates that would basically be free downloadable content nowadays. The major releases that mattered would be the excellent Ridge Racer Type 4, Ridge Racer V (a PS2 launch title), Ridge Racer on PSP, and Ridge Racer 6 (a 360 launch title). Those are the ones actually pushing the series forward, adding new features, and changing the mechanical focus (from arcade driving to drifting, mostly).\n\nThe others are generally various forms of remixes and riffs on those four. As mentioned, Bandai Namco has largely pumped the brakes on the series since around 2012, with the last release being a mobile title called Draw & Drift in 2016. Still, as long as there's still somebody out there simping over Reiko Nagase, the series will never truly die.\n\nWell we can keep this one brief. If all of these games represent a high school graduating class, Tekken is the class president who went on to become a Hollywood director. No other game on the disk has maintained the staying power or popularity Tekken has. If anything, it's just astonishing just how fast we went from the relatively timid Battle Arena Toshinden to the hard-hitting Tekken within two months, and the two-hit combo of Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 3 would take the whole 3D fighter genre into lightspeed not even a year later. Namco evolved this formula so fast in such a short period, and while the moves would get flashier, and Kazuya Mishima would get tossed into bigger and bigger volcanoes, the foundation of everything Tekken would become was already there in 1995.\n\nWhere Are They Now?:As of the time of writing, the Tekken series as a whole has sold over 60 million copies, 2024's Tekken 8 has sold about 4 million copies, and it's Bandai Namco's best selling franchise by a wide margin (though the fact that Elden Ring is #2 at 40 million copies sold between only two games in the series is bananas).\n\nSo, yeah, they're doing fair-to-middlin'.\n\nIf Tekken was the class president of that first demo disc class, Air Combat gets the \"Most Likely To Succeed\" trophy. The first title in the series isn't even a particularly great game--great soundtrack aside, it's sparse and bland much of the time, at a time when your average arcade had the likes of G-LOC and After Burner. But the foundation of a great game is in there, and Namco would just keep building on that foundation slowly but steadily over the years, delivering consistently on a premise that, weirdly, you don't really see much of outside this series. But they had to start somewhere, and the original Air Combat is more of an academic curiosity nowadays than a graphical showcase.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Bandai Namco has basically dropped a new Ace Combat every 2-3 years since 1995, and aside from the free-to-play experiment we don't talk about anymore, you can pick up any of them past the first, and be in for a solid time flying the unfriendly skies. The eighth installment was formally announced at the 2025 Game Awards, and it was genuinely one of the highlights of the night.\n\nFor some reason, Sony decided that they needed two vehicular combat games during their launch window, and for some reason didn't immediately decide to just run with the one with the evil ice cream truck in it. To be fair, the first Twisted Metal doesn't go nearly as buck wild with its roster and features as the subsequent games would outside of old Sweet Tooth, but the game's edgelord attitude still made it stand out, and the addition of guns and bombs to the mix makes it a little more freewheeling than Destruction Derby was. It's not the best the series would have to offer, but there's plenty of what the series would become right there from the start.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: As a game series, Twisted Metal has had kind of a rough time of it. Twisted Metal 2 is a stone-cold classic, while the series just kinda spins its wheels for 3 and 4. Twisted Metal: Black was a grim(m) and gritty triumph that got the series back on track, only for Sony to put the series on ice for another four years. Twisted Metal: Head-On on PSP is mediocre on its own, though it did get a director's cut of sorts on PS2 that offered way more bang for the buck. The franchise goes back to sleep again until 2012, and a pretty great PS3 reboot.\n\nIt's now been 13 years, and if one were to hazard a guess what the hold up is, the, uh… well,let's usethe word\"colorful\"... reputation of series creator David Jaffe in the industry probably has something to do with why Sony hasn't decided to give the property another shot as a game. Instead, all the focus is now on the small screen, with Twisted Metal getting a live-action TV show adaptation on Peacock, and stunning everybody by actually being really, really fun, enough to get renewed for a third season, in fact.\n\nWhat's really striking as this list goes is just how many studios pulled double duty with the PS1's launch, putting two games out, and trying to suss out what actually sticks. The other thing is how many of these games end up cannibalized by the others in the same genre. In this case, despite being a better, more dynamic aerial combat title than Air Combat, and the tongue-in-cheek tone granting it a grim charm, Warhawk is kind of a distant memory. While yes, we can maybe blame Twisted Metal for pulling SingleTrac's focus away from The Little VTOL That Could, there were enough hard hitting, pulse pounding dog fights going on here to warrant more than being largely forsaken mere months after launch.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: The game wasn't completely forgotten, in fairness. Sony did put out a pretty decent and successful multiplayer-only reboot in 2007, which holds the distinction of being the first physical game to ever get a digital release on the PlayStation Network. That, in turn, got a sci-fi spinoff called Starhawk which was also rock solid, though after so many complaints about Warhawk ‘07 being multiplayer-only, Starhawk got a single-player campaign that feels like a monkey's paw curling on those complaints.\n\nEven compared to Jumping Flash, Philosoma is the genuine buried treasure of that first demo disc. At the time of its release, it was torn apart by critics for not being next-gen enough. It's not hard to see why, really. Philosoma is, essentially, a Whitman's Sampler of every single type of scrolling space shooter ever made up to that point. One stage will scroll left to right. The next will shift to a behind-the-ship POV. The next may take an isometric Zaxxon angle. While they're all well done, and the array of weapon variants is a highlight, in 1995, scrolling shooters were the epitome of a played-out genre. It'd be the equivalent of putting out a new hero shooter now. In 2025, a cool, straightforward space shooter would be a pretty welcome sight by itself. But it wouldn't be the decent gameplay that would make Philosoma stand out.\n\nSee, the story is that you play a pilot sent down to a colonized planet with a squadron led by a tactical AI, after the colonists put out a distress call. The planet seems deserted, but there's a whole lot of insectoid creatures running around, many of which seem to have infected the colonists' technology. As your crew starts scouring the planet for the colonists, one by one, the team's AI starts pulling a HAL 9000 on your teammates, while still leading you deeper into the planet's core. Eventually you find the colonists: liquified and strung up from the ceiling in a massive insect's hive like something out of a Junji Ito book. And you find out that not only is the planet alive, but your ship has been commandeered to fertilize the planet so the alien life form at the core can be born. It is DEEPLY horrifying, but easily one of the most memorable space shooters of the generation because of it. At least, for the maybe dozens of folks who actually played it.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: So, weird enough, Philosoma does technically have a sequel: a survival horror/visual novel game on PS2 called Phase Paradox that never saw Western shores. Funny enough, despite never making it out of Japan, it's fully voiced in English. It's not great, but it does in fact pick up where Philosoma left off, and it's honestly rather ambitious for the time, kind of a proto-David Cage game mixed with Parasite Eve.\n\nAs for the developers, they'd go on to do far less horrifying projects after. Two years later, G-Artists would be responsible for the extremely fun Intelligent Qube. Ten years later, the game's composer, Kow Otani, would go on to score Shadow of the Colossus. One of the folks who worked on visual effects for Phase Paradox is some dude named Yoko Taro. Wonder if he ever went on to do anything. Anyway, safe to say, a third go-around for this universe isn't in the cards. But what a ride.\n\nLast and most definitely least. FPS titles were still a pretty new genre in ‘95, especially on consoles, which makes it miraculous Jumping Flash got so much right. But even with that grace afforded, Kileak being miles and miles of copy/pasted hallways with the occasional robot to break things up is just the absolute worst, and the reward being a dozen or so audio logs from a mad scientist who thinks he found \"the real Adam\" isn't nearly enough to keep going. If you hated Ridley Scott's Prometheus, now imagine it was rendered on a PS1, but also they couldn't afford Michael Fassbender, so they hired a malfunctioning Disneyland robot from the Hall of Presidents. That's the level of production value you're working with here. Unsurprisingly, the video that comes on the demo disc shows none of that, just the cool CG cutscenes of mechs arriving at the South Pole to take down a mad scientist, with a techno song bumping over it.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Somehow, Kileak also got a sequel, called Epidemic (it goes by the far more ostentatious Kileak: The Blood 2: Reason in Madness in Japan) a year later. The big improvement is that now the hallways have texture. The emptiness problem is still very much in place, the acting is still abysmal, the shooting is still uninspiring. By the time it released, Doom, Hexen, and Alien Trilogy would all be on PS1. There is no excuse for an empty FPS map at this point. The developers, Genki, would go on to have a very long career pumping out consistent 6/10 games, but the only familiar names on their resume for Westerners would be the Tokyo Xtreme Racer games on Dreamcast/PS2, and, oddly enough, Katamari Forever on PS3, which was largely made of remixed stages from the previous games. Still, it netted them the best review scores of their career with near-universal 7s. Yay progress?",

    "description": "The Witcher and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red is the latest company to sound off on the use of AI in gaming. During CD Projekt Red's latest earnings briefing, Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski said there are \"meaningful\" and \"real\" benefits to using the technology.\nThe company is already implementing such technologies \"mainly in the productivity areas\" and so far that's where the \"largest benefits\" have stemmed from, he explained, as reported by GamesRadar. A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said.\n\"The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.",

    "description": "It's lonely out in space, especially if you're a Starfield player waiting for any word about the next major update coming to the game. Bethesda's space-based game will receive an additional story DLC, it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter.\nAccording to Windows Central, Bethesda \"felt more comfortable\" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a \"busy holiday period\" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine’s dramatic escalation of its sea-drone attacks on tankers carrying Russian oil could spread to the English Channel, experts have warned.\n\nThe hit on an Oman-flagged tanker on Friday widened the Ukrainian operation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, signalling that sanctioned tankers could be hit anywhere on their journey.\n\n“The Ukrainians are now operating across a much wider area. If you’re a shadow fleet vessel then there’s now a risk wherever you are,” said Matthew Wright, of trade intelligence firm Kpler.\n\n“You get shadow fleet vessels that come out of the Baltic Sea, they are essentially going through the North Sea. The threat to them is now higher.”\n\nMichelle Bockmann, from maritime data company Windward, said the Ukrainians were likely to continue focusing on empty tankers rather than those laden with oil, but the attacks could impose massive costs on the vessel operators.\n\nShe added: “Marine insurers have been saying for quite a while now that one of these vessels, if they have a casualty, especially if they go through the English Channel, that they’re a billion-dollar marine accident waiting to happen.\n\n“Ukraine is aware of this risk, and I think that’s why this is a new strategy, an evolving strategy, and definitely one to watch.”\n\nThere are close to 1,000 tankers involved in Russia’s shadow fleet – the vessels, often false-flagged and with obscure ownership, that ferry crude or refined Russian oil to customers primarily in India and China.\n\nAbout 600 carry exclusively Russian oil, which puts them within the Western sanctions net. Roughly another 350 carry Russian oil alongside other cargo.\n\nUkraine has carried out drone attacks on three shadow tankers in the Black Sea in the past month, and is also thought to have been behind an apparent limpet-mine explosion off the coast of Senegal.\n\nExperts said the broadening attacks could prompt some vessel owners to question whether the risk of working for Vladimir Putin was still worth the reward.\n\nThe attacks could drive up ship owners’ insurance premiums. The insurers are believed to be mostly Russian or Chinese, and Kpler said operators might start to worry about whether they would get a payout if attacked.\n\nKpler’s Mr Wright said: “The London insurance market is incredibly well capitalised. It can handle a lot of large claims because the risk is spread. Whereas we don’t have a lot of visibility of how well capitalised the insurers are who cover the Russian shadow fleet.\n\n“If you’re a shadow fleet owner, you’d be asking whether you might get paid out. It will make a lot of the owners who have been leading players in the shadow fleet think about whether the risk-reward is worth it.”\n\nThe vessel owners could react to the bigger risks by raising the prices they charge Russia, further squeezing the Kremlin’s war chest.\n\nUkrainian security sources told local media this calculus made these tankers fair game.\n\n“The aggressor state used this tanker to circumvent sanctions and earn money that was used for the war against Ukraine,” the sources were quoted as saying.\n\n“Therefore ... this is an absolutely legitimate target. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop, and will beat him anywhere in the world.”\n\nThe Ukrainian action underscores the extent to which civilian tankers have become involved in geopolitical conflict and tension this year, with the US also blockading oil-freight traffic around Venezuela.\n\nMs Bockmann said this blurring of the line between the commercial and military domains was making the industry “uneasy”.\n\nArsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the UN’s International Maritime Organisation, this week urged restraint.\n\n“As the situation continues to escalate in the Black Sea, I call on all parties to refrain from targeting innocent seafarers, port workers and merchant ships,” he said.\n\n“Shipping should not be used as collateral in geopolitical situations and there is an increased environmental risk developing.”\n\nThe Ukrainians appear to be targeting only empty tankers, to avoid triggering an environmental disaster.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Multiple shark sightings at a Hawaiian beach have closed the waters to residents and tourists in the area.\n\nAt Nanakuli Beach on O'ahu, visitors and residents lost access to the beach as local authorities took safety measures after multiple shark sightings. According to Hawaii News Now, the Honolulu Ocean Safety Department spotted a non-aggressive seven to eight-foot shark, and about five minutes later, they spotted a 10-foot tiger shark at the beach.\n\nCrews posted signs, patrolled by land and sea, and kept the public informed while assessing the situation.\n\nShark sightings along O'ahu's coast are common and tracked by the state with a public incident log for residents and tourists to check. Still, the string of recent sightings has heightened concerns, especially as the beach remains a popular spot for families, surfers, and swimmers.\n\nWhile shark encounters are statistically rare, shifts in human behavior and environmental conditions are making close interactions more likely. Rapid coastal development reduces habitat and disrupts feeding patterns, while resource shortages and warming waters can push marine animals closer to popular beaches.\n\nRecent beach closures for sharks in California saw sharks moving farther north to establish a nursery in Monterey Bay, where none had existed before. Juvenile white sharks usually grow in warmer southern waters, but as ocean temperatures rise, they travel to new territory, sometimes not returning to their normal spots for years.\n\nResearch has shown increases in human-wildlife conflict in areas experiencing habitat loss and higher temperatures, not just in the ocean, with potentially dangerous outcomes for both wildlife and humans. Protecting coastal ecosystems, like reefs and beaches, before they disappear, helps reduce these risky interactions while supporting biodiversity and the health of local communities.\n\nOfficials urge beachgoers to avoid murky waters, swim in groups, steer clear of dawn and dusk hours, and always check with a lifeguard before entering the ocean. If you see or encounter a shark, notify ocean safety authorities immediately or call 911.\n\nConservation efforts across Hawaiʻi and beyond are offering hope and potential solutions. Reef restoration projects, marine-protected areas, and local programs have shown success in strengthening ecosystems and wildlife behavior. Coral recovery initiatives and community shoreline conservation work from organizations like the Surfrider Foundation can also help recover these natural environments.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A Northern California man caught a plump canary rockfish he says weighed in at 10.25 pounds (4.65 kilograms), likely setting state and world records.\n\nMendocino County fisherman Brendan Walsh, 26, said he caught the fish Tuesday off the coast of Albion, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of San Francisco.\n\nWalsh was headed back with his father Will Walsh after catching a few yellowtail on a cold and rainy day when he decided to make one last stop at a deeper spot. That's where the younger Walsh landed the canary rockfish.\n\n“It was a fluke,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\nCanary rockfish can grow up to 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) in length and weigh 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Walsh says the ones he usually catches are small and scrawny, clocking in around 3 lbs. (1.4 kilograms).\n\nWalsh said the fish he caught this week was 2.25 feet (0.68 meters) long.\n\nHe submitted the catch to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which tracks angling and diving records. The current state record-holding fish weighed in at 9 lbs. and was caught last November, also in Mendocino County.\n\nThe department has a form and instructions for submitting a possible record catch, including the names and phone numbers of witnesses. Applicants are asked to contact the department for the nearest environmental scientist who can identify the catch.\n\nWalsh said they weighed the fish at an authorized fish market nearby and a state fish and wildlife scientist who works in the area came over to sign off on the paperwork.\n\nWalsh has also submitted his catch to the International Game Fish Association in Florida, where the world record holding 10-pound canary rockfish was caught in 1986. He says larger fish may have been caught but never submitted for record consideration.\n\nThe game fish association did not respond Friday to a request for comment.\n\nAfter spending Tuesday making sure they had taken the right measurements to document the catch, Walsh's mother, Deirdre Lamb, fried the rockfish with garlic and butter to eat on Wednesday.\n\nThe rockfish was delicious, he said.",

    "fullText": "on December 19, 2025 at 2:24PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nRogue has joined Marvel Rivals as part of Season 5.5, adding to the growing list of Vanguard heroes. She joins as a melee tank focused primarily on brawling and diving, while also being the first 5-Star difficulty tank according to NetEase's in-game difficulty rankings. Rogue comes ahead of Season 6, which will see the addition of Deadpool and Elsa Bloodstonein yet unannounced roles.\n\nRogue is a damage-heavy tank, focused on disrupting the enemy team through a number of dashes and dives. Her primary attack, Power Surge Punch, follows a three-hit combo dealing 35 damage on the first two hits and 45 on the third. She can use her defensive stance to temporarily reduce incoming damage while powering up her next punch. In that stance, she can also use one of her dashes, Southern Brawl, to close the distance and deal damage.\n\nHer Chrono Kick Combo knocks enemies up into the air, while Rogue temporarily flies. Using the ability again does a downward dive kick, dealing AoE damage and bringing Rogue back to the ground. Fatal Attraction has Rogue dash forward, before releasing a ring of damage around her that pulls enemies closer. Lastly, her ultimate ability Heartbreaker depletes enemies' ultimate charge in a large AoE circle, while also absorbing key stats and dealing a small amount of damage.\n\nPower Surge Punch (primary): Punch forward with both fists.\n\nDefensive Stance: Absorb nearby projectiles and reduce incoming damage; absorbed damage powers up your next Southern Brawl.\n\nSouthern Brawl: While in Defensive Stance, dash forward and slam enemies in front, dealing area damage.\n\nChrono Kick Combo: Dash forward and launch the enemy, entering flight; activate again to Knock Down nearby enemies. Your next two Power Surge Punch attacks become ranged, piercing enemies and granting Bonus Health.\n\nFatal Attraction: Dash forward. Press again to unleash a burst of Chronovium Power, dealing continuous damage to nearby foes; after a delay, the energy retracts, pulling all enemies towards Rogue.\n\nAbility Absorption: Dash forward to knock down your target and absorb their energy; after absorbing, replace Ability Absorption with one of their abilities or refresh Fatal Attraction. Also absorb Health and stats based on their role.\n\nHeartbreaker (ultimate): Continuously absorb Ultimate Ability Energy from nearby enemies and steal stats based on their role.\n\nHearts as One (Gambit team-up): Gambit shares kinetic energy with Magneto and Rogue. When Magneto activates this ability, Iron Volley is replaced with Ace Greatsword, which detonates upon striking enemies. The explosion leaves residual kinetic energy within the target, inflicting secondary damage after a brief delay. When Rogue activates the ability, each of her attacks causes a kinetic explosion that damages nearby enemies and heals nearby allies.\n\nRogue straddles a thin line between being a brawler and a dive tank. She certainly has the strength to be a dive tank, but her low self-sustain makes surviving without support from a Strategist quite difficult. This is solved by her team-up with Gambit, providing some healing and extra damage, but you won't always have that.\n\nInstead, you need to balance out diving into combat and using one of Rogue's three movement abilities to get out of danger, too. With high cooldowns, this can be tough to manage, and it never feels good to use an ability to leave a fight instead of finishing an enemy off, but remember, as a tank, your role is to disrupt the enemy team. You can't do that effectively if you overextend, especially if it results in you getting killed. If you don't feel like the abilities you can absorb from your enemies are impactful, consider holding Ability Absorption for a Strategist or Vanguard to give yourself a quick health boost.\n\nRogue is at her best when you are constantly in the thick of battle with your team. While you might rack up some impressive damage numbers, your focus shouldn't be on finishing enemies off, but instead making it difficult for your opponents to effectively play the game. Rogue's Chrono Kick Combo is a great example, where you can knock opponents up and disrupt their movement a second time on the downward kick.\n\nHer Fatal Attraction ability pulls enemies close to you as well, making it easy to force enemies to spend energy on you, instead of taking out your Strategists or Duelists. If an enemy Daredevil or Black Panther wants to dive your supports, you can make their lives hell by disrupting their combos and game plan, purely by just getting in the way. Even if you can't take them out in the process, keeping your supports alive is worth the effort and an effective way to play Rogue.\n\nRogue's ultimate ability, Heartbreaker, leans into her lore to create a unique ability. She unleashes a large AoE circle around herself, that depletes enemies' ultimate charge. While it does a ton of other stuff, this primary power of depleting enemy ult charge makes it the kind of ultimate ability that you should be using as soon as it's up, regardless of the situation. Using it whenever you have it lowers the number of ultimates your opponents can use, which is a huge advantage in Marvel Rivals. You'll still need to pick your spots to ensure you get a couple of enemies in it, but holding it for the right moment is the wrong move.\n\nIn terms of actually using it, you also gain attack power from Duelists, self-healing from Strategists, and maximum health from Vanguards. Basically, if you can keep a couple of enemies in range, you'll deal a ton of damage and be tough to take down. Most people will scatter as soon as you activate it, so make sure all of your movement abilities are off cooldown, so you can keep them in range if they try to run from you.",

You'll need internet access for some of its puzzles--allowing you to access various files and even an old Walkman--though even folks unfamiliar with the series can help unravel this strange mystery.\n\nYour standard deck of cards gets a Stranger Things makeover with this fun set. The officially licensed set also comes with a collectible store tin, giving you a cool place to stash your cards when they're not in use.\n\nAnother set of playing cards, this time with a higher quality finish and more premium materials. Featuring holographic red and silver foils, these high-end cards are a nice alternative to the gift set above.\n\nTop Trumps is a simple card game that has you battling to collect all the cards in the deck. This rendition gets you cards featuring iconic characters from the show, including Eleven, Hopper, Mike, and even the Mind Flayer.\n\nThink you're a Stranger Things expert? Test yourself with this quiz, featuring 500 questions and a nifty storage container.\n\nPick up some Top Trumps cards along with a unique collector's tin. The tin is the big selling point here--featuring a Hawkins High School design, it's a cool bit of memorabilia for your home theater.\n\nSave Hawkins from a series of supernatural threats in this cooperative board game. It features events from the first two seasons, comes with 11 miniatures (including the Demogorgon and Eleven), and each match runs for about an hour.\n\nThe Mind Flayer is taking over Hawkins, and it's unclear who is under its control. This bluffing game sees \"Sane\" characters battling against \"Possessed\" characters, but the other players don't know which team you belong to. That means you'll have to bluff your way to success, while trying to determine who you can trust along the way.\n\nPlay through the last campaign of Eddie Munson. You'll get to go on four adventures that have you fighting Demogorgons and Demodogs, and the set includes everything you need to get started--such as retro cards, character sheets, dice, and a DM's screen.\n\nPut together a stylized image of a Demogorgon tangled in festive holiday lights. The finished puzzle is 21.25 x 15 inches, and you'll get a full-color poster as a bonus.\n\nLooking for a big project to work on? Check out this colorful 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, which features Eleven as part of the Nina Project. The completed puzzle is 26.75 x 19.75 inches, and you'll get a reference poster to help you along the way.\n\nPut together an iconic scene of the Stranger Things kids as they bike through the eerie streets of Hawkins. It's a big undertaking at 1,000 pieces, though no doubt it's one of the coolest designs up for grabs. Includes a reference poster and the finished project clocks in at 26.75 x 19.75 inches.\n\nPut together a cool panorama of various Stranger Things scenes. The main cast is shown off across the seasons here, making it a fun way to commemorate the finale on New Year's Eve.\n\nFeaturing a unique black, white, and red design, this 1,000-piece puzzle looks much different than the ones above. It adapts the artwork from the premium playing cards into a puzzle, though it keeps some of the holographic elements for a truly eye-catching design.\n\nWe're not sure if it'll allow you to communicate with the Upside Down, but you can definitely use it to build some cool, colorful designs. This version includes templates inspired by the show, such as the Hellfire Club Demon, Demodog, and Eddie's Guitar.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Rep. Elise Stefanik announced Friday that she is suspending her campaign for New York governor and will not seek reelection to Congress, abruptly bowing out of what was expected to be a bruising Republican primary and ending a once-promising tenure in the House.\n\nStefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump, said in a statement that she was confident of her chances in the Republican primary for governor against Bruce Blakeman, a county official in New York City’s suburbs. But she said, “It is not an effective use of our time” to stay in the race, and that she instead wants to spend more time with her young son and family.\n\n“I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness — particularly at his tender age,” she said.\n\nStefanik was set to have a tough race against Blakeman, with both politicians counting themselves as allies of Trump and attempting to court his support. Though, the president had seemed keen on avoiding picking a side in the race, telling reporters recently: “He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people.”\n\nOn Friday, Trump, writing on his Truth Social media platform, called Stefanik a “fantastic person and congresswoman.”\n\n“Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” Trump wrote.\n\nStefanik, who represents a conservative congressional district in northern New York, has been an intense critic of incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is also seeking reelection but faces a primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.\n\nFollowing Stefanik's exit, Hochul's campaign spokesperson said, “If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose.\"\n\nStefanik was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she won her first campaign in 2014 at just 30 years old, representing a new generation of Republicans making inroads in Washington. She ultimately rose to her party’s leadership in the House when she became the chair of the House Republican Conference in 2021.\n\nFirst viewed as a moderate when she came to Washington, Stefanik became far more conservative as Trump began to dominate the party. Once someone who refused to say Trump’s name, she became one of his top defenders during his first impeachment inquiry. She would go on to vote against certifying the 2020 election results, even after a violent mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nLast year, Stefanik was tapped to become the president’s ambassador to the United Nations, though her nomination was later pulled over concerns about her party’s narrow margins in the House. She then began to angle toward a run for governor.\n\nStefanik’s decision follows a clash with Speaker Mike Johnson, whom she accused of lying before embarking on a series of media interviews criticizing him. In one with The Wall Street Journal, she called Johnson a “political novice” and said he wouldn’t be reelected speaker if the vote were held today.\n\nThe tumultuous early December episode appeared to cool when Johnson said he and Stefanik had a “great talk.”\n\n“I called her and I said, ‘Why wouldn’t you just come to me, you know?’” Johnson said. “So we had some intense fellowship about that.”\n\nStill, Stefanik, the chairwoman of the House Republican leadership, has not fully walked back her criticisms. A Dec. 2 social media post remains online in which, after a provision she championed was omitted from a defense authorization bill, Stefanik accused Johnson of falsely claiming he was unaware of it, calling it “more lies from the Speaker.”\n\nBlakeman, the executive of Nassau County on Long Island, released a statement Friday night that thanked Stefanik “for her outstanding service to the people of New York and to all Americans.”\n\n“I am ready to work hand-in-hand with the Congresswoman and all New Yorkers to restore accountability, affordability, and safety to state government,” he said.",

Cadwalader’s current co-managing partners will be relegated to the new firm’s management committee.\n\nPartners at both firms still need to vote to finalize the merger next year.\n\nThe deal is being described as the legal industry’s largest-ever merger, creating a $3.6 billion megafirm with more than 3,000 lawyers, according to the Journal.\n\nHogan Lovells is headquartered in London and Washington, D.C.\n\nCommenting on the merger, Zaldivar said Wall Street had long been the firm’s “missing piece,” telling the Journal, “We felt that we needed to consolidate our position with a strong finance practice in New York.”\n\n“It’s a deal that makes perfect sense,” he added.\n\nDespite being burned by its prior dealings with Trump, Cadwalader co-managing partner Pat Quinn reaffirmed the company’s commitment to pro bono legal work in a statement shared by Reuters.\n\nHowever, he declined to say whether the firm’s previous deal with the administration would apply to the merged firm.\n\nLast year, another famous Wall Street firm, Shearman & Sterling, merged with Allen & Overy to create a $3.4 billion business. Chicago-based firm Winston & Strawn also announced plans on Monday to merge with U.K. practice Taylor Wessing in 2026.",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Travis and Jason Kelce don’t agree on the best place to find tacos. The debate on this week’s “New Heights” podcast included some disparaging remarks by Jason about Kansas City’s Mexican cuisine and one KC taqueria doubling its social media following.\n\n“I am not going to Kansas City for tacos,” Jason said.\n\n“Because it’s the Midwest. I’ll go to L.A. for tacos, I’ll go to Miami for tacos,” Jason explained.\n\nKansas City Royals ‘fully committed’ to crossing state line: KS Senate President\n\nWhile the elder Kelce brother may not be a believer, the future Chiefs Hall of Fame tight end gave a shout out to one of his KC taco favorites on Wednesday’s New Heights podcast.\n\n“My phone was blowing up saying hey did you see the podcast,” Rudy’s Tenampa Taqueria owner Rudy Garcia Jr. said.\n\n“Rudy’s? I’m not going to a taco spot called Rudy’s,” Jason Kelce exclaimed.\n\nRudy’s have called Westport home for more than 30 years and now also have a Lenexa location.\n\n“Any skeptical people that come in all you got to do is take one bite and they are hooked,” Garcia said about the taqueria’s name which he shares with his father, Rudy’s founder.\n\nRudy Sr. said that’s what happened when Travis started stopping by a decade ago, almost always ordering the deep fried chicken tacos. Thursday New Heights followers followed suit.\n\n“I’m a big 92 percenter, love the podcast love Travis and Jason and what they are doing for the community,” first time customer Nate Hetmanek said.\n\nChiefs head trainer Rick Burkholder gives timeline Patrick Mahomes recovery, rehab\n\nAcross the state line Taco Trail promoters who’ve had almost 30,000 check ins the past five years welcome Jason’s opinions and the opportunity to change his mind.\n\n“You get a mix of tacos. There are places that have birria there are places that have carnitas like think of a type of taco you’d like to have and high possibility the taco trail has multiple options for that. Come experience the trail and give us a chance.” Ritz Dasgupta, Visit Kansas City Kansas’ marketing director, said.\n\n“It’s not supposed to be in a strip mall in Kansas City. I will try these tacos, I will beyond shocked if they can compete,” Jason told Travis while praising a L.A. taco truck.\n\n“If he comes in I’d be glad to have him come down here and have some really good Mexican food,” Rudy Garcia Sr. said.\n\nDasgupta added the Taco Trail offers private bus tours if Jason Kelce wants to make sure he’s making an educated opinion on the quality of Kansas City tacos.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — The young journalist in a red bow tie stood during President Vladimir Putin's annual news conference Friday and displayed a sign saying he wanted to get married. But his main question wasn't directed at Putin — it was to his girlfriend, Olga, proposing marriage.\n\nPutin complimented Kirill Bazhanov of Yekaterinburg’s Channel 4 on his snazzy tie, saying, \"You’re ready to go to the registry office!” Bazhanov told Putin “we’d be very glad to see you at the wedding.”\n\nThe Russian leader’s year-end media session had serious questions, of course, about late pension payments, construction projects gone wrong, and the fighting in Ukraine, where Putin sent troops nearly four years ago.\n\nBut every year — amid the weighty questions from the domestic and international media — there are also odd and lighter moments, like this year when people asked Putin what his license plate number was and whether love at first sight existed.\n\nIt’s all part of the spectacle of the tightly orchestrated event — an opportunity for Putin, who has ruled Russia for 25 years, to expound on a wide array of subjects as well as to burnish his image as a fatherly figure to address the concerns of ordinary Russians who submit questions in advance.\n\nBazhanov did actually have a question for Putin — about greater support for young families. Later in the 4 1/2-hour news conference, one of the anchors passed along the news that Bazhanov's girlfriend had said yes. Putin promptly quipped about collecting money for the wedding.\n\nFor those inside Moscow’s Gostinny Dvor amphitheater, the most important task was to get Putin's attention. Most brought signs and some wore national dress. One reporter brought a clutch of Labubu dolls personalized to look like Russian officials and one in the form of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nOne reporter asked whether a comet approaching Earth could be a UFO, and reassured Putin that the city of Tyumen would be ready to welcome any extraterrestrial guests.\n\nPutin seemed unfazed throughout, although Tajik journalist Shamsudin Boboyev caused a brief commotion when he tried to give Putin a book. Two security officials quickly stopped him from going onstage, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested Boboyev should simply describe the gift, which would be given to him later.\n\nToward the end of the session, a journalist who noted that Putin had said earlier he believed in love at first sight asked him if he was in love. The Russian leader, whose private life remains closely guarded, answered simply, “Yes.”\n\nDavies reported from Manchester, England.",

    "fullText": "A total of 2.75 inches of rain fell in the Eugene area Dec. 18, breaking the previous Dec. 18 record of 1.52 inches set in 2018.\n\nThat rain has translated into two river floods in Lane County: the Siuslaw River in Mapleton, which peaked at 21.6 feet of water at 4 a.m, and the Mohawk River near Springfield, which is projected to peak at 16.32 feet at 4 p.m. The Siuslaw is considered flooded when it reaches 18 feet and the Mohawk is considered flooded when it reaches 15 feet.\n\nMike McGillivray with Springfield Public Works said the flooding on the river hasn't translated into flooding in the city proper. He said crews have so far only heard of one reported flood in Springfield on Centennial Boulevard and they've since resolved it.\n\nHe said if Springfield residents are aware of more flooding they should report it by calling 541-726-3761 between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., or 541-726-3714 (the police non-emergency line) after hours.\n\nLast night's rain also broke records in Portland, Salem and Hillsboro. Of the four cities, Salem was hit the hardest with 2.93 inches of rain. While not record setting, southwest Oregon also saw its share of rain with 0.84 inches in Roseburg and 2.27 inches in Drain. And the coast was not left out either, with 1.51 inches falling in Mapleton and 1.92 inches in North Bend.\n\nNWS' flood warning for the Willamette Valley lasts until Dec. 20.

    "description": "These fancy features will supposedly make your life easier—but may actually do the opposite.",
    "fullText": "Whether you want them to or not, appliances are getting smarter. It’s increasingly challenging to find even basic models without some kind of “smart” feature or embedded artificial intelligence. If you don't believe me, just try to find a “dumb” television at your local Best Buy. You will be disappointed.\n\nWhile it's true that many of the “smart” features offered by these nifty new appliances are quite useful. The ability to pre-heat your oven or adjust your thermostat by pressing a button on your phone is great, and getting alerts when the fridge door is left open or when you forget to move your laundry from the washer to the dryer is undeniably a boon.\n\nBut sometimes, the convenience these features offer is an illusion, as many supposedly smart features in modern appliances aren’t very smart at all—and they can actively make your life harder instead of easier. If you’re shopping for a new appliance, considering avoiding these not-so-smart features.\n\nModern clothes dryers offer a lot of great capabilities. Some can even talk to your washer, pre-setting themselves for the laundry coming its way, and many can remind you to collect your laundry, sparing you wrinkled clothes, and to clean out the lint filter. But modern dryers often come with moisture sensors that shut off the dryer when it detects that your clothes are dry. In theory, sensor drying saves you money and time over a fixed time dry. But the sensors in these dryers are notorious for being inaccurate shutting the dryer down when your clothes are still a bit damp. And you still have to make a guess as to how much drying you need and set the sensor to the proper level. At best, this can mean running another drying cycle. At worst, your clothes will sit there getting mildewy until you remember to check the machine.\n\nNew dishwashers often come with efficient or “eco” modes that use less water and less energy to clean your dishes. That’s a great idea—in theory. But these modes achieve those efficiencies the only way they can: By running at lower temperatures and literally using less water in their cleaning cycles. This can often leave your dishes visibly dirty after running a load, forcing you to cancel out the benefit by running them a second time. Worse, these modes don’t get hot enough to kill dangerous bacteria like E. coli, so even if your dishes come out looking clean, they may not be sanitary.\n\nSmart fridges are often at the top of people’s complaints list for two main reasons: One, they are often abandoned by their manufacturers soon after they arrive on the market, with updates and support vanishing in as quickly as two years. That transforms your pricey smart fridge into a pricey dumb fridge. More frustratingly, smart fridges that supposedly use artificial intelligence to identify your groceries as you place them inside (in order to help you track your shopping needs and expiration dates) often get things wrong. For example, this woman complained that her smart fridge often mistook her husband’s head for an avocado, among other problems, which rendered the feature worse than useless.\n\nWhile the modern microwave remains the steadfastly boxy, unsexy beast it’s always been, there have been attempts to make it smarter—and sometimes these attempts backfire on you. Some microwaves offer “sensor cooking,” the ability to sense the weight and moisture level of the food in order to adjust cooking time and power levels to cook your food perfectly. Except when it senses incorrectly and leaves you with a half-cooked mess, or if you’re trying to cook something that simply doesn't work well with sensor cooking, like dry foods that don’t produce enough steam for the sensor to detect.\n\nA smart kitchen scale might seem like a nifty idea; you weigh your food and use an app to get nutritional information, like the amount of calories in what you’re about to eat. That’s fine, but it really just adds an unnecessary step to your cooking routine, because most “smart” scales are just regular, standard kitchen scales and an app that Googles on your behalf. You’ll get the same general experience—and likely better accuracy—by weighing something and using your phone to search for nutritional information yourself.\n\nSmart garage doors are a great example of a piece of technology that isn’t improved much by being smart. And the core technology that makes the garage door smart—a WiFi connection to a cloud server—can also make it worse than useless. Aside from the fact that any disruption in the door’s connection can cause it to remain locked in the open position, leaving your home vulnerable, there’s also the fact that the manufacturer can make changes any time they like that could potentially alter the way your door functions or brick it entirely.",

    "description": "You can't just stick with the same workout forever.",
    "fullText": "As you get stronger, you become able to lift heavier and heavier weights. That's the idea at the heart of an often-misunderstood fitness concept: progressive overload. Unfortuantely, there are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about this principle, so here's how to use it to plan your own workouts or judge whether a program you're following will keep you on track.\n\nProgressive overload is the increase, over time, in the amount of work or stress you ask your body to handle. The term is used two different ways: as a principle of how the human body works, and as a description of how a workout program changes over time. If you want to know how to \"do progressive overload,\" you're thinking of the second one—how to design a workout program.\n\nThe simplest way to implement this is to just do a little more each time you're in the gym. More weight, or more reps, or making the workout harder in some other way. You can still take some easier \"deload\" workouts (or weeks) from time to time, but over the long term you want to see a trend of the workouts getting harder. They won't necessarily feel harder, because you'll be getting stronger. It's more like the workouts are keeping up with you.\n\nIn other words, progressive overload is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. As you get stronger, your workouts need to get harder to keep up. But in a sense you are also becoming stronger because you're challenging yourself with harder workouts.\n\nIf you’re bummed out by the idea of working harder and harder forever, don’t panic. You’ll work harder in absolute terms—by lifting heavier weights, let’s say—but the challenge stays about the same in relative terms. Your workouts will fall into an effort level you might call “hard, but doable,” and you’ll notice progress because your numbers are going up. (A similar approach applies to endurance sports. As cyclist Greg Lemond reportedly said: “It never gets any easier, you just go faster.”)\n\nWhen I started lifting weights many years ago, 65 pounds was a decently challenging bench press for me. I remember being proud of myself for being able to squeeze out a rep or two at 85 pounds. Now, if I’m going to do a bench workout, I don’t even bother loading those amounts onto the bar. My warmup sets start at 95 pounds, and a heavy single might be around 135. That 135 feels just as hard as 85 used to, but it’s undeniably more weight.\n\nHow did I make that progress? Well, I kept lifting the weights that felt heavy for me. Over time, the same weights that used to be challenging started to feel easy, and I needed to add more and more weight to the bar to get something that actually felt heavy. (I have a guide here to figuring out whether you’re lifting “heavy.”)\n\nMost of the time, I either followed a program that told me how many pounds to lift, increasing that amount slowly over time, or one that told me what effort level to lift at (a concept called RPE), which allowed me to choose an appropriate weight each day. Following a program will usually net you better progress than just winging it, but as long as you’re using the overload principle and the progression principle, you will get stronger.\n\nHere are some examples of workout routines that use progressive overload:\n\nDouble progression. Let's say you're aiming for three sets of eight to 12 reps of dumbbell shoulder press. You choose a weight that you can handle for 3 sets of 8 reps. The next time you do shoulder press, try to add at least one rep. If you can't, that's fine—just do your three sets of eight. One day maybe you'll get 10 reps on the first set, then only eight on the next two. Another time maybe you get 12, 10, and eight. After a few weeks you manage three full sets of 12. That means it's time to increase the weight! The next time you do the exercise, you'll use a heavier set of dumbbells and start again at three sets of eight. It's called \"double\" progression because first you increase the reps, and then you increase the weight.\n\nLinear progression. This is a common progression for barbell exercises for beginners. You do the same number of reps every time (say, five sets of five reps) but add a small amount of weight every workout. Often the program will have instructions for what to do if you can't complete the five sets of five reps at the new weight. These workouts aren't usually realistic for experienced lifters, since you can't keep increasing the weight forever, but they're great for people who are learning an exercise for the first time or returning to the gym after a break.\n\nSet progression. This may be used along with double progression, or may be its own thing. You start with just a few sets of an exercise per workout, say two or three, and then add a set each week. Once you're doing, say, five sets, you'll start over with heavier weight. If you're using it with double progression, you'll increase sets, and then reps, and then weight.\n\nDensity progression. This is commonly used in timed sets, like Crossfit WODs (\"workout of the day\") or for accessory lifts. Set a timer for several minutes and do as many reps as possible in the given time, resting as needed. The next time you do the workout, try to do more reps in the same amount of time. Once you can do the lifts with little to no rest, you'll either add weight or find another way to make the exercises harder (for example, doing dips instead of pushups).\n\nAs you can see, weight isn't the only variable that progresses. You can increase reps, or sets, or increase the amount of work you do in a given time by decreasing rest. You can increase the difficulty by choosing a harder exercise (like progressing from dips to pushups). As long as things get harder over time, you're doing progressive overload.\n\nAdding weight is part of most progressive overload schemes, but you don’t have to add weight to the bar literally every time you lift. There’s a wide range of weights and rep ranges that can be effective for building strength and muscle. For example, if I did a bench workout today, I might do sets of 10 at 100 pounds, or sets of five at 120, or some heavy singles at 140, or any combination of these. If I’m really tired or stressed, I might decide to do the sets of 10 at just 90 pounds. If I’m feeling great, I might be able to do them at 105. This is what I mean by a wide range: All of these are hard enough work to spur my muscles to adapt and get stronger. (There are reasons you might choose one of these workouts over the others, but we don’t need to get into those details at the moment.)\n\nWhat wouldn’t be progressive overload? Well, if I did sets of 10 with just the bar, that wouldn’t help me get stronger. If I had a mini barbell set, and it maxed out at 85 pounds, my strength would stagnate once I got to the point where 85 pounds isn’t a challenging weight anymore.\n\nEven as your strength improves, you don’t have to do more every single workout, as long as you’re getting stronger in the long term, and your workouts are still in the range that is challenging to you.\n\nSo let’s say you’re doing bicep curls with a 10-pound dumbbell. You can do eight or 10 reps with it. Perfect. But the only way to add weight, at your gym, might be to pick up a 15-pound dumbbell. If that weight is too heavy for you, that’s okay. Keep working with the 10-pounder, and in time you’ll be ready for the 15.\n\nWhile you’re probably itching to lift heavier weights, weight on the bar is not the only way to progress. Sometimes you can’t add weight because of equipment issues, or just because your strength is improving slowly. (Even if your beginner gains were meteoric, everybody’s progress slows down at some point.)\n\nBut if you’re smart, you probably don’t want to only get better at one specific thing. A lot of beginners start off doing squat, bench, and deadlift in sets of five reps, and trying to add weight each workout. But you’ll be a more well-rounded lifter if you also know how to lift heavy singles and sets of 10 or 15. Depending on your goals you might consider front squats in addition to back squats, and reverse hypers or kettlebell swings in addition to deadlifts. There are ways to improve at all of these things, and it’s normal for a lifter to be simultaneously increasing their reps in accessory lifts, increasing their weight on the bar for heavy singles, and increasing the amount of time they spend on conditioning workouts.\n\nNot every workout or routine will have progressive overload built in. For example, if you have a favorite workout that you do every day, but you never make it any harder (say, it's always three sets of ten pushups), you won't make progress over time. That's OK if you enjoy the workout for another reason, like if you're just trying to get the mental health benefits of a little exercise boost in the morning. But if you want to get better at pushups, you need to find a way to do more of them over time, or make them harder in some way (like elevating your feet, or doing them with a backpack on).\n\nWorkouts with progressive overload tend to be personalized to you. If the workout tells you exactly what to do, down to the exact weight of dumbbell to pick up, it's not giving you room to choose the weight that matches your current strength level. The 12-3-30 treadmill workout, for example, is the same for everyone every time. If it's one-size-fits-all, there's no way to progress.\n\nThat said, some workouts have a sneaky progression built in. If you jog for 30 minutes each day, chances are you'll get a little faster over time even if you don't realize it, and then you're doing more work within the same amount of time. Or if you do \"three sets of 10\" of an exercise, but each day you pick up whatever dumbbells feel appropriate for that level, you'll probably end up using heavier ones over time. Just make sure you don't get stuck doing the exact same thing month in and month out.\n\nOne last thing, now that we’ve discussed what progressive overload looks like. It’s important to remember that progression happens in the long term. Some competitive lifters might not test their one-rep max outside of competition, which means they’ll only find out once or twice a year how much their deadlift has gone up. That doesn’t mean they haven’t progressed in the meantime. If they’re doing an effective program, consistently challenging themselves, they’re still working.\n\nPlateaus are a fact of life when you’re a lifter. Sometimes it takes a while to get stronger. Sometimes you need to work on your technique to be able to express your newfound strength. Sometimes factors like stress or weight loss or changes in your training can make you weaker in the short term, but if you keep training in a way that challenges you, you’ll set new PRs soon enough.",

    "fullText": "There are warning signs that your home network may have been compromised, such as unusual traffic patterns and slowdowns in system performance, but now there's a simple tool to help determine if your router or connected devices are being used to conduct malicious activity. IP Check, from threat monitoring firm GreyNoise, will alert you if your IP address has been observed scanning the internet as part of a botnet or residential proxy network.\n\nAs GreyNoise outlines, residential IP compromise often isn't obvious to the user because you're still able to conduct business as usual, such as streaming, emailing, and web browsing. All the while, though, threat actors are routing malicious activity through your home IP address and can potentially exploit your network for everything from account takeovers to malware distribution.\n\nTo use IP Check, you simply need to open the tool in a browser window, and you'll get one of several results. If your IP is clean, that means that your network hasn't been caught scanning the internet (nor does it belong to any known business service infrastructure).\n\nYour IP may also be flagged as being in the GreyNoise database, which is not a sign of compromise—this is likely because you're using a VPN, corporate network, or cloud provider, and the tool can distinguish between an IP belonging to a data center and one that's being exploited. (Note that Apple users browsing in Safari with Private Relay enabled will likely see \"Possible Spoofed Traffic Detected,\" which also is not necessarily cause for alarm. Try checking your real IP in a different browser like Chrome or Firefox to confirm.)\n\nIf your IP is identified as malicious or suspicious, you should investigate further. If you toggle open the Observed Activity section of the scanner, you can see when the first and last instances of the scanning behavior occurred and what types were detected along with actionable next steps.\n\nAs BleepingComputer notes, you can get into the weeds with detecting malicious activity by reviewing device logs, network traffic, and activity patterns, but checking your IP address is the simplest place to start.",

    "description": "A downgrade in features and an upgrade in quality of life.",
    "fullText": "My concentration is shot. I know this because I've checked my phone four times while writing this opening paragraph. I'm addicted to my phone in a way that feels both embarrassing and completely normal, which is perhaps the most damning part. My phone feels essential for everything: my job requires Slack and email responsiveness, my hobbies live in apps and group chats, and even my downtime involves scrolling through feeds I don't actually enjoy.\n\nThese days, we tend to think of upgrades (in life, in tech, wherever) as adding features, but sometimes the real upgrade is eliminating. So I did something a little radical this year: I bricked my iPhone. Well, sort of. And it's been the best tech decision I've made in years.\n\nWe talk about phone addiction like it's a personal failing, but cut yourself some slack. Every app, every notification, every infinite scroll is designed by engineers whose job is to keep us locked in. As such, we've eliminated almost all empty space from our lives, filling every waiting moment with content consumption. Waiting for the train? Scroll. In line at the store? Scroll. Between tasks at work? Scroll.\n\nI can't afford to go full \"dumb-phone\", so I took a middle path: \"demoting\" my smartphone, so it functions like a dumb phone while retaining genuinely useful features like navigation, ride shares, and FaceTime. Here's what I did:\n\nI turned on grayscale mode. It's amazing how boring your phone becomes when it looks like an old newspaper. That dopamine-triggering red notification badge? Just gray. Instagram's carefully curated visual feast? Gray. Suddenly my phone looked as exciting as a filing cabinet.\n\nI deleted the time-consuming apps. I got rid of the primary social media apps, any news apps that were really just anxiety delivery systems, and more social media apps. If I wanted to check something, I'd have to do it on my computer, which added just enough friction to make me reconsider whether I actually cared.\n\nI turned off non-essential notifications. Actually, I turned off almost all notifications. No badges, no banners, no sounds. My phone became silent unless someone was actually calling me or texting me directly.\n\nI started physically separating myself from my phone during focused work. It went in another room, face down in a drawer, anywhere but within arm's reach. Out of sight, out of the dopamine loop.\n\nThis might sound embarrassing, but it's honest: at first, it felt like phantom limb syndrome. My thumb kept reaching for apps that weren't there. I'd pull out my phone in line at the coffee shop only to stare at a blank screen and think, \"Now what?\" The answer, it turned out, was nothing. And that nothing was exactly what I needed.\n\nThe first week was genuinely uncomfortable. My brain kept expecting hits that weren't coming. I felt anxious, ashamed, humbled, understimulated, almost itchy—which pretty much told me everything I needed to know about how deep the addiction ran.\n\nLuckily, the benefits rolled in faster than I expected. Within two weeks, I noticed I could read for longer stretches. I also think my work as a creative improved. Deep work—the kind where you're tackling genuinely hard problems—requires getting into a flow state. I need at least 20 minutes of uninterrupted focus to even enter that zone, and for me, an Instagram notification shatters it instantly. By removing the interruption infrastructure from my phone, I suddenly had whole mornings where I could think clearly.\n\nAlong with dumbing down my phone, I set an intention to become more observational again. I'd be waiting somewhere and instead of reaching for my phone, I'd just...look around. Watch people. Notice architectural details. Eavesdrop on conversations. Observe the weather shifting. It sounds small, but it completely changed my relationship with being in public spaces.\n\nI believe boredom is where creativity lives. When your mind isn't being constantly fed, it starts generating its own entertainment. I had ideas in the shower again. Real ideas, not just fragments borrowed from something I read online; I had original thoughts that surprised me, connections my brain made when it wasn't being force-fed content. This sounds mundane, but I promise, it's the opposite. This is how thinking actually works when you let it.\n\nEspecially with social media, I'd settled into this constant need to perform my life. While I still find this performance necessary to \"make it\" as a creative these days, I learned that most of my FOMO was an algorithm problem. You're not actually missing out on anything important; you're being shown a curated highlight reel designed to make you feel inadequate. Once you step out of that stream, you realize how much of it was manufactured anxiety. The things I thought I needed to keep up with turned out to be completely forgettable.\n\nMy bricked iPhone is a downgrade in features and an upgrade in life quality. That's the whole story, really.\n\nWe frame phone usage as a personal responsibility issue, but that's like blaming people for getting hooked on substances that were engineered to be addictive. Companies build their algorithms around persuasive technologies. They run A/B tests on features to maximize engagement. They know exactly what they're doing, and what they're doing is turning your attention into profit.\n\nLook, I'd love to go more radical with it, but I have limits. For work, I need to be responsive—Slack messages can't wait three hours. And I genuinely adore getting laughs in a group chat, which is a timely thing. Those moments of connection matter, and I'm not interested in becoming a total digital hermit.\n\nBut going forward, I'm desperate to keep getting my brain back. My ability to think deeply, pay attention, create meaningfully, and connect authentically—these aren't optional luxuries. They're the whole point.\n\nIf your phone feels like it owns you more than you own it, maybe your next upgrade isn't a new model. Maybe it's just making your current one a little more boring, a little less exciting, and a lot more brick-like. Your brain will thank you for it.",

    "description": "Direct navigation isn't without risk.",
    "fullText": "Clicking through search results to a website comes with the risk of landing on a spoofed page that is actually a phishing scam, but so does navigating directly by typing a URL into your browser. As reported by Krebs on Security, researchers at security firm Infoblox have identified a swath of scams on lookalike and parked (or placeholder) domains. If you end up on one of these websites, you'll be directed not to the trusted page you're expecting but scam content, including scareware and other malware.\n\nThis scam capitalizes on you navigating directly to a website by typing the URL into your browser's address bar. If you accidentally mistype either the top-level domain (TLD)—.gov or .com, for example—or the second-level domain (SLD), which is the company name (Google or Amazon), you could land on a page that has been commandeered by threat actors for malicious purposes.\n\nIn some cases, these may be typosquats, meaning cybercriminals have registered domain names that look nearly identical to trusted ones. In others, they may be real domains that have expired and are simply advertising placeholders that spread malware.\n\nInfoblox researchers found that visiting one of these sites often initiates a chain of redirects, through which threat actors profile data like your IP geolocation, device fingerprint, and cookies. That means you don't necessarily need to click any links on the parked page to be served malicious content. They note, though, that parked websites were only malicious if visited from a residential IP address and benign if accessed using a VPN or a non-residential IP.\n\nOne common piece of advice for avoiding phishing websites is to type trusted URLs directly into the address bar rather than clicking through search, as threat actors will try to exploit results, including placing paid ads, to redirect you to malicious domains. This can still be a safe way to get to your destination, but you should check your spelling of both TLDs and SLDs carefully, as small errors could land you on a scam site.\n\nI've covered similar website trickery like homograph attacks, which use lookalike characters in URLs to direct you to phishing sites that, on the surface, appear to be legitimate domains. Unless you inspect the address very carefully, you may not catch the scam.",

They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.\n\nRamya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.\n\nWhile the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.\n\nThe decision comes after a series of wins for the Justice Department on the high court’s emergency docket. The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "Bill Clinton faces renewed questions over the extent of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after he featured heavily in the first tranche of unsealed documents.\n\nDozens of photographs of Mr Clinton with the late paedophile tycoon were released by the Trump administration, including showing him in a hot tub and swimming with Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe pictures are part of the so-called Epstein files that Congress ordered to be released by Dec 19 after mounting public pressure on Donald Trump.\n\nThe US department of justice said “hundreds of thousands” more documents would be released in the coming weeks, suggesting some of the most damaging for the White House could be published over Christmas.\n\nDemocrats accused the Trump administration of censoring the release to protect the US president.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump’s spokesman shared a picture of Mr Clinton relaxing in the hot tub with the comment: “Oh my!”\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor also featured in the first trove of documents, including a picture of him lying in black tie across the laps of five women, below.\n\nMaxwell also features outside 10 Downing Street. Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson are also pictured with Epstein and his associates.\n\nThe Clinton hot tub picture showed the former president lying half-naked with a woman whose face has been redacted.\n\nGates McGavick, a justice department employee, claimed the woman whose face was blocked out was an Epstein victim.\n\nAnother photograph, below, that appeared to be taken on the same occasion also showed Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for trafficking teenage girls to Epstein, in a dimly-lit swimming pool with Mr Clinton.\n\nThe former president was photographed with his arm around a young, blonde woman sitting on his lap on a red velvet chair on a separate occasion. The woman is one of many females in the Epstein files whose face has been redacted.\n\nA similar picture showed Mr Clinton in a red hooded sweatshirt with his arm around a blonde woman.\n\nThe furniture in the background appeared to match that of Epstein’s private jet, nicknamed the “Lolita Express” over allegations that the businessman used it to traffic underage girls to his island in the US Virgin Islands.\n\nFurther images released on Friday showed the 42nd president and Epstein pictured side-by-side with their arms around one another in twin patterned shirts at a dinner function, below, as well as one of Mr Clinton with Michael Jackson.\n\nThe tranche of images also included a framed caricature of Mr Clinton and Epstein getting ready to board an aircraft alongside two unidentified men. The drawing was hung up in a bathroom, thought to belong to Epstein.\n\nMr Trump has sought to draw attention to Epstein’s relationship with Mr Clinton as scrutiny intensified over his own links to the paedophile.\n\nSusie Wiles, Mr Trump’s own chief of staff, said this week in an interview with Vanity Fair that her boss was “in the file” but that “he’s not in the file doing anything awful”.\n\nMr Clinton’s spokesman has repeatedly said the former president did not know about Epstein’s crimes and cut ties with him before his 2019 arrest. He has never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n\nThe politician has previously been photographed with Epstein on a number of occasions in the early 1990s.\n\nHe and Maxwell were pictured speaking with the then-president in September 1993 at an event for donors to a White House restoration project.\n\nEpstein gave two $1,000 donations to Mr Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992.\n\nThrough a spokesman, Mr Clinton described Epstein in 2002 as “both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist”.\n\nA picture of Epstein and Mr Clinton together in Brunei in 2002 appeared in Vanity Fair, about the time he was taking trips on the sex offender’s private jet.\n\nMr Clinton’s spokesman said after Epstein’s arrest for sex trafficking in 2019 that the former president took four trips on the jet between 2002 and 2003, including “stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation” in Africa.\n\nThe 2019 statement confirmed the two men met at Epstein’s Harlem office and at his New York apartment. Mr Clinton is also alleged to have contributed to Epstein’s 50th birthday book in 2003.\n\nJames Comer, the Republican chairman of the House oversight committee, has subpoenaed both Bill and Hillary Clinton to provide in-person depositions into the panel’s Epstein investigation.\n\nThe committee is offering the former president and former secretary of state new deposition dates in January and threatening possible contempt proceedings if they do not comply.\n\nThe Clintons were first subpoenaed in August and have been involved in a legal argument over whether they need to appear in person.\n\nEpstein also kept a cartoon of him and Mr Clinton above what appears to be his toilet, the new files show.\n\nThe photo shows a framed drawing of a muscle-bound Epstein alongside the former president outside of a private jet.\n\nDemocrats on Friday night demanded answers from the Department of Justice as to why so many redactions were made in the documents.\n\nRo Khanna, the congressman behind the Epstein Files Transparency Act, said the initial files protected the identity of “rich and powerful men” complicit in the paedophile’s activities.\n\nMr Khanna claimed Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, could be prosecuted or impeached after “obfuscating for months”.\n\nA document from a New York grand jury has 119 pages “totally blacked out”, with no explanation for the redactions as required by the Act, even though a federal judge had agreed to its release, he said.\n\nFox News reported that the same redaction standards were applied to politically exposed individuals and government officials as they were to victims.\n\nWhite House officials, meanwhile, mocked Mr Clinton for the images released of him with Epstein and various women.\n\nSteven Cheung, a White House communications adviser, said under one picture: “Slick Willy! Bill Clinton just chillin, without a care in the world. Little did he know…”",

Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today.

Again, it was Kok who has on hand to capitalise and score.\n\nTwo minutes before the break, things got even better for Ulster when Stewart swatted away the challenges of Tector and Lowe to claim Ulster's third.\n\nDespite conceding six penalties in the first half, Ulster's blitz defence was proving effective.\n\nThirteen minutes after the restart, however, Leinster finally got to the outside with Kenny scoring in the corner.\n\nThe Leinster bench had a formidable look to it and the arrival of Paddy McCarthy, Sheehan, Tadhg Furlong and Joe McCarthy was helping to swing the momentum.\n\nLeinster's progress, however, was seemingly halted by a yellow card shown to James Ryan for a dangerous clear-out.\n\nThe first score of the sin-bin came through a Doak penalty but Leinster would outscore Ulster with 14 men thanks to Lowe's try with a quarter of an hour remaining.\n\nClinging to a three-point lead, Ulster were shown a yellow card of their own with referee Andrew Brace judging David McCann's knock-on to be deliberate.\n\nWith the back row's transgression occurring in the 71st minute, the visitors would finish the game a player short and could not hold on for the win.\n\nFive minutes from time, the pressure finally told as Ulster's ill-discipline was punished with a penalty knocked into the corner for Sheehan and his fellow forwards to drive over the line for the winning try.\n\nLeinster will travel to Thomond Park on 27 December to take on Munster with Ulster travelling to Connacht on the same day.\n\nUlster: Stockdale; Baloucoune, Postlethwaite, McCloskey, Kok; Murphy, Doak; Bell, Stewart, O'Toole, Sheridan, Irvine, McCann, Timoney (capt), Augustus.\n\nReplacements: Andrew, Crean, Wilson, Hopes, Ward, McKee, Flannery, McIlroy.\n\nLeinster: Frawley; Kenny, Ioane, Tector, Lowe; Prendergast, McGrath; Boyle, G McCarthy, Slimani, Deeny, Ryan, Soroka, Penny, Conan (capt).\n\nReplacements: Sheehan, P McCarthy, Furlong, J McCarthy, Deegan, Gunne, Byrne, Moloney.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Grady, Adams Cons: Sheedy 2 Pens: Sheedy\n\nTries: James, G Davies 2 Cons: Hawkins 3\n\nA try double from scrum-half Gareth Davies allowed Scarlets to continue their Arms Park dominance against Cardiff in the United Rugby Championship (URC).\n\nIt was the third successive match at the Arms Park where 35-year-old former Wales scrum-half Davies has grabbed a pair of tries.\n\nCentre Eddie James also scored to extend Scarlets' winning run at Cardiff's home ground that goes back to 2019.\n\nIn a pulsating derby, Cardiff dominated territory and possession but could not capitalise on Scarlets' ill-discipline, with yellow cards for Josh Macleod, Davies and Johnny Williams.\n\nThe Blue and Blacks were wasteful in attack as they managed only two tries, through wings Mason Grady and Josh Adams, from more than 20 entries into the Scarlets 22.\n\nIn contrast, the Scarlets' dynamic defence forced Cardiff into many handling errors, as Dwayne Peel's side somehow came away with another victory in the Welsh capital to prevent their hosts from going top of the URC table.\n\nCardiff captain Liam Belcher recovered from a neck injury to be one of six changes from the side that defeated Ulster, while Scarlets were boosted by the return of Wales full-back Blair Murray after Peel rotated his starting side for the 50-21 loss against Bordeaux-Begles.\n\nThe home side dominated the early exchanges and had an early James Botham try disallowed because of a knock-on.\n\nScarlets prop Henry Thomas was lucky to avoid a yellow card after conceding a penalty close to the line, before visiting captain Macleod was given a warning for the amount of transgressions.\n\nThe hosts could not make their pressure tell as Scarlets' defence repelled the wave of attacks.\n\nWith number eight Fletcher Anderson making the hard yards, Scarlets showed their opponents a lesson in ruthlessness as they created the opportunity for centre James to stroll over with Joe Hawkins converting.\n\nMacleod was shown a yellow card for a silly off-the-ball tackle on Sheedy, a decision given by referee Ben Breakspear for the amount of penalties conceded.\n\nScarlets were reduced to 13 men a couple of minutes later when Davies was sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on.\n\nCardiff made their numerical advantage tell when the ball was worked to Grady to score in the left corner, with Sheedy converting from the touchline.\n\nMurray avoided becoming a third Scarlets player to be shown a yellow card when his knock-on was deemed to have been in a tackle when Cardiff had a two-man overlap.\n\nScarlets' dogged defence continued to stand firm and Cardiff had to be content with a Sheedy penalty just before the interval to establish a 10-7 half-time lead.\n\nIt was a half where the visitors conceded 10 penalties as Cardiff dominated territory and possession.\n\nThe second half followed the same script initially as Thomas and James held up Cardiff number eight Alun Lawrence over the Scarlets line.\n\nPeel's side again showed their opponents a clinical edge as scrum-half Davies continued his Arms Park try-scoring love affair by sniping down the side. Hawkins converted to give Scarlets a four-point lead.\n\nThat soon disappeared when Adams was the beneficiary of a clever pinpoint Sheedy chip to expertly score in the corner.\n\nCardiff made multiple changes, including the return of number eight Taulupe Faletau, who has recovered from a knee injury suffered in October that ruled him out of the November Tests.\n\nScarlets would not go away and Davies popped up for a trademark interception 70-metre try.\n\nThe topsy-turvy tie continued as an incisive Faletau break was followed by a third Scarlets yellow card for centre Williams for a professional foul at a ruck.\n\nCardiff could not manage any points with the extra player before Murray was carried off in the 78th minute.\n\nCardiff desperately tried to clinch the win but it was fitting Davies had the final touch as he booted the ball off the field to send Scarlets supporters into raptures.\n\nThis was the first of five Welsh derbies over the festive period with two more on 26 December and pair of games on 1 January.\n\nWhat the local derby scene will look like at the end of next year remains to be seen.\n\nIt is an uncertain time in the domestic game in Wales, with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) proposing to cut one of its four men's professional sides.\n\nWelsh rugby's governing body has said it proposes to grant three licences for men's professional clubs.\n\nThere will be one in Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west, which could result in a survival fight between Swansea-based Ospreys and Scarlets in Llanelli.\n\nAfter temporarily going into administration in April, Cardiff were taken over by the WRU with the governing body expecting to sell the organisation to fresh investors in the new year.\n\nOspreys' owners, Y11 Sport & Media, have been linked with taking over Cardiff, which is another way the governing body could get its wish of losing a men's professional side.\n\nOspreys or the club's owners have so far not commented about the Cardiff rumours which has fuelled concern among supporters surrounding the future of their side.\n\nWhatever happens, one fewer Welsh side could mean fewer rousing derby occasions like this one which was played in front of 11,728 fans.\n\nCardiff: Winnett; Adams, Millard, B Thomas, Grady; Sheedy, A Davies; Southworth, Belcher (capt), Sebastian, McNally, Nott, Botham, D Thomas, Lawrence.\n\nReplacements: E Lloyd, Barratt, Wainwright, Thornton, Mann, Faletau, Mulder, Beetham.\n\nScarlets: Murray; Rogers, James, J Williams, Mee; Hawkins, G Davies; Mathias, Elias, H Thomas, Lousi, Ball, Douglas, Macleod (capt), Anderson.\n\nReplacements: Van Der Merwe, Hepburn, H O'Connor, T Davies, Taylor, A Hughes, Price, J Roberts.\n\nSin-bin: Macleod 26, G Davies 28, J Williams 60.\n\nReferee: Ben Breakspear (Wales)\n\nAssistants: Ben Whitehouse & Ben Connor (Wales)",

I think someone said he made 71 metres with the ball in hand. His collisions are always huge, but Sol actually moves the ball better than people give him credit for.\n\n\"I thought we moved the ball better - or more - than we have done previously which is something we've been working on.\n\n\"We thought we could exploit Gloucester by just moving the ball a little bit more. We've got some very, very good outside backs who like to get the ball in their hands.\n\n\"We always know we can fall back to our set-piece because that is obviously normally a strength of ours.\"\n\nGloucester captain Tomos Williams told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:\n\n'Very disappointing. We had a pretty poor start and then continued the night in the same fashion.\n\n\"It was a lot of our own inaccuracies. We probably got caught in two minds during the game and if you're not fully committed then that's when those inaccuracies come. Fair play to Leicester, they forced some errors as well, I thought they played very well.\n\n\"The try at the end of the first half probably put a dampener on our spirits and then again at the start of the second half. When you concede two tries either side of half-time so close, you're always going to be struggling.\n\n\"Saracens are coming on the 27th for the Christmas game and we need to get our heads down for that game. We're at home and we can't have a performance like that at Kingsholm in front of the locals. We owe them a lot more than that performance, definitely.\"\n\nLeicester: Steward; Radwan, Perese, Kata, Hassell-Collins; Searle, Whiteley; Smith, Blamire, Heyes, Henderson, Wells, Thompson, Reffell (c), Moro.\n\nReplacements: Clare, Haffar, Hurd, Chessum, Williams, van Poortvliet, Bailey, Woodward.\n\n20-minute red card: Clare (67).\n\nGloucester: C Atkinson; Russell, Butler, S Atkinson, Thorley; Byrne, Williams (c); Rapava Ruskin, Blake, Laulala, Thomas, Clark, Basham, Ludlow, Clement.\n\nReplacements: Innard, Ford-Robinson, Fasogbon, Jordan, Taylor, Austin, Knight, Hathaway.",

They. Everybody loved (him). I don’t know about no enemies. I’ve never heard about nobody not liking them. None of that. Really, I have no idea.\n\nAbout four hours before closing time Tuesday night, someone shot and killed McGowan who was a Wendy’s manager. The next morning, crews were still on the scene cleaning the building. \nTwo years ago, the brothers’ mother, Kyna McGowan was shot and killed on Madison Avenue in Newport News.\n\n“She got killed in [an]argument. The lady shot her in the face. This happened when I was incarcerated, so I couldn’t even be there to morally support [the family],” said Mason.\n\n“I tried everything I could, to keep him involved in his and nieces lives. It was never no bad words between us. It was always good memories,” Mason said. “He was loved by many. He was loved by many. But more than I even knew. Now that I see it, he’s gone. It’s a lot more people than I thought.

Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming announced Friday that she won't seek reelection in 2026, but she said she's committed to retaining Republic control of the Senate.\n\nLummis said her stamina “doesn't match up” with the energy required for another term.\n\n“In the difficult, exhausting session weeks this fall I’ve come to accept that I do not have six more years in me,” she said in a statement. “I am a devout legislator, but I feel like a sprinter in a marathon.”\n\nLummis is a former state legislator and two-term state treasurer who served as Wyoming’s lone congresswoman from 2009-2017. She joined the state Legislature at age 24 at the outset of a career in politics and government that spans nearly a half-century.\n\nIn 2020, she defeated nine Republican rivals to secure the party nomination for Senate in an open race.\n\nWyoming hasn't elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in more than 50 years.",

    "fullText": "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A judge on Friday ordered special elections for the Mississippi Supreme Court after earlier finding that the electoral map used to select justices violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock in August ordered Mississippi to redraw the map, which was enacted in 1987, concluding the current configuration dilutes the power of Black voters. The Friday ruling gives the Mississippi Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to redraw the map.\n\nSection 2, which is the primary way plaintiffs can push back against racially discriminatory election practices, is currently being challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOnce the legislature approves a new map, Aycock wrote that she will move quickly to meet any deadlines necessary to hold the special elections in November 2026.\n\nAycock also wrote that she will defer deciding which seats will be subject to a special election until after the new map has been adopted.\n\nThe order follows a 2022 lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the current map cuts Mississippi’s Delta region — a historically Black area — in half, diminishing the Black vote in the Central District.\n\n“Mississippi is nearly 40% Black, but has never had more than one Black Justice on the nine-member Court,\" Ari Savitzky, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, wrote in a statement. \"We couldn’t be happier to see justice on the horizon.”\n\nIn her August ruling, Aycock noted only four Black people have served on Mississippi’s Supreme Court. All of them held the same seat in the Central District and were first appointed to the position by a sitting governor.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State’s Office is appealing Aycock’s August ruling. The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed its proceedings pending the outcomes of the SCOTUS case and other related cases.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State and Attorney General’s offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn December, two Mississippi Supreme Court justices were appointed to federal judgeships. Gov. Tate Reeves will appoint replacements to serve until new justices can be elected.\n\nIn Mississippi, Supreme Court elections are nonpartisan.",
