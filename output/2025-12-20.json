    "fullText": "Wrexham boss Phil Parkinson claimed Swansea's Ethan Galbraith was fortunate not to be sent-off for the challenge which has left Lewis O'Brien facing a spell on the sidelines.\n\nParkinson said O'Brien suffered shoulder and knee injuries after being fouled by Galbraith during Wrexham's 2-1 defeat at Swansea City on Friday.\n\nMidfielder O'Brien, who excelled during a loan spell at Swansea in the second half of last season, came on as a second-half substitute against his former club but only lasted seven minutes before leaving the field clutching his shoulder.\n\nAnd Wrexham boss Parkinson pointed the finger at Swansea's Northern Ireland midfielder Galbraith, who was booked for his challenge.\n\n\"If you all look at the tackle - we all will - it's a bad tackle. It's high, it's dangerous, I think he's very lucky not to get red,\" Parkinson said.\n\n\"He's injured his knee and he's dislocated his shoulder.\n\n\"It's tough for him because he's been good for us, Lewis, and he was coming back to a club he was at last year.\"\n\nWhen asked about Parkinson's criticism of the Galbraith tackle, Swansea head coach Vitor Matos said: \"That's what Phil said, that's his opinion, I have nothing to comment on that.\n\n\"I will not comment on the referee's performance, that's not for me. That's for someone else, so yeah, nothing to say.\"\n\nParkinson says Wrexham will have to wait to discover how long O'Brien faces on the sidelines.\n\n\"But of course it doesn't look good,\" he added. \"He's a tough player and he's not coming off unless it's something really serious.\"\n\nListen to the latest Swansea City interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds\n\nListen to the latest Wrexham interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe University of Texas athletic department has been ranked the most valuable in college sports for 2025, according to a CNBC valuation released this week. Texas’s program is estimated at $1.48 billion, a 16% increase from the prior year and enough to vault the Longhorns past leader Ohio State.\n\nOhio State which held the top spot in last year’s ranking, slipped to second despite a 2% valuation increase, landing at approximately $1.35 billion.\n\nCNBC’s reporter Michael Ozanian values the 75 most valuable college athletic programs at a combined $51.2 billion, up 13% from 2024. The surge reflects escalating revenue streams, including media rights, sponsorships and the expanding impact of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals for student-athletes.\n\nTexas A&M retains the No. 3 spot at roughly $1.32 billion, while Georgia and Michigan round out the top five, each valued at about $1.16 billion. Notre Dame is sixth at $1.13 billion, followed by Tennessee at $1.12 billion and USC at $1.10 billion. Alabama and Nebraska are also among the top 10, all topping the $1 billion threshold.\n\nOf the top 25 athletic departments, 12 programs hail from the Southeastern Conference, with multiple SEC schools valued above $1.3 billion. Oregon sit just below the billion-dollar mark, despite a lucrative tie to Nike.\n\nThe widening valuations demonstrate how the business of college sports continues to grow, fueled largely by football revenues and lucrative conference television deals. The rise of NIL compensation packages has further broadened the financial abilities of elite programs, with some universities leveraging star athletes to enhance revenue and marketability.\n\nThe annual valuation shows a shifting landscape in collegiate athletics, where financial muscle increasingly figures into competitive balance and strategic planning across the four major conferences.\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nPat McAfee delivers reality check to Diego Pavia for Heisman weekend antics\n\nFernando Mendoza won't keep the Heisman Trophy\n\nWhy LSU should be extremely nervous about Michigan firing Sherrone Moore",

    "fullText": "With the January window fast approaching, Manchester United have a lot on their plate, and the whole Kobbie Mainoo situation is only adding to the uneasy atmosphere around the club.\n\nRuben Amorim’s treatment of the Englishman has been genuinely surprising. There is an obvious gap at the base of the midfield, where Casemiro is currently the preferred option.\n\nThe Brazilian hardly managed to last the full 90 minutes, while Manuel Ugarte’s Old Trafford adventure seems to be drawing to a close.\n\nDespite this, the head coach does not feel the Carrington graduate has the requisite skillset to thrive in a deeper role, instead seeing him more as a backup for Bruno Fernandes.\n\nThe club captain hardly ever misses games, which has meant the England international is yet to start a single Premier League game this season.\n\nHe had asked INEOS to allow him to leave on loan in the summer, but the co-owners had instead asked him to stay and fight for his place.\n\nBut with Amorim continuing to ignore him, things have reached a breaking point as per The Daily Mail. Up till this point, all the midfielder was asking for was a loan to jumpstart his chances of making England’s World Cup squad.\n\nBut now, he is open to a permanent exit, with Napoli the frontrunners. His contract situation has only exacerbated his ill-feelings towards his boyhood club.\n\n“United supporters are desperate to see more of the homegrown player, who is yet to start a Premier League game this season… but Mainoo is now considering a permanent exit\n\n“Even in the unlikely event that he is picked ahead of Manuel Ugarte to replace the suspended Casemiro at Aston Villa on Sunday, it will be a temporary fix.\n\n“Daily Mail Sport understands Mainoo’s relationship with his boyhood club is now at breaking point. With no contract proposal on the table, he continues to earn around £40,000 a week – roughly a third of his market value.\n\n“Mainoo sees no future for himself at Old Trafford under Amorim, and if a loan move in January included an option to leave permanently, then he would now consider it.\n\n“Napoli are still at the front of the queue and there is a growing optimism in southern Italy that Antonio Conte will get his man this time, reuniting Mainoo with Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund.”\n\nHis brother’s stunt has certainly not helped his position, while INEOS are unlikely to sanction an exit in January unless a serious acquisition can be made.\n\nAll their top targets like Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson, and Adam Wharton are unlikely to jump ship in the middle of the season.\n\nAnd with the 20-year-old’s current contract still having two years left to run (with the option to add another year), the Red Devils do not need to let him leave on the cheap.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this saga unfolds in the coming weeks.\n\nFeature image Jan Kruger via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Dodgers predicted to break baseball by making blockbuster trade for $500 million two-time Cy Young, would create mythical 1-2 punch with Yoshinobu Yamamoto originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are on their way to becoming a true dynasty after winning back-to-back World Series wins. If they want to secure their place in history, they need to make one more move that would make them legendary.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Christopher Kline, that move is one that’s been floated around a lot recently: trading for Detroit Tigers two-time Cy Young Tarik Skubal.\n\nMORE: Red Sox receive update regarding possible Ketel Marte trade, division rival enters the mix\n\n“Maybe the Detroit Tigers decide to let Skubal finish out his contract and focus all their efforts on winning in 2026, but there's strong incentive to cash in now. The odds of Skubal, a potential $500 million pitcher, re-signing next winter are practically zero. Meanwhile, the Dodgers offer an appealing collection of MLB-ready pitching (Emmet Sheehan, River Ryan, etc.) and up-and-coming bats (Alex Freeland, Zhyir Hope, Daulton Rushing, etc.). I'm not sure another team can outbid the Dodgers if motivated,” Kline wrote.\n\nKline followed up, saying that the Dodgers could also include an All-Star to immediately replace Skubal in the Tigers’ rotation, and this deal would be appealing to Skubal for personal reasons.\n\n“L.A. can also dangle Tyler Glasnow, himself an established, All-Star ace, to sweeten the pot or to replenish prospect depth in a separate deal. The Dodgers are one of the few teams that can operate with the confidence that re-signing Skubal is a realistic end goal. He won't find a better path to multiple World Series titles. He also grew up in California, so it's a homecoming of sorts,” Kline concluded.\n\nMORE: Padres predicted to trade for $15.5 million two-time All-Star ace, would create nasty 1-2-3 punch with Michael King, Nick Pivetta\n\nThis past season, Skubal won his second Cy Young in two years, posting a 13-6 record, a 2.21 ERA, 241 Ks, and a WHIP of 0.891 over 195 innings pitched. Combine him with Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell, Shohei Ohtani, and Roki Sasaki, and the Dodgers get the most mythical rotation of all time.\n\nFor most MLB fans, hopefully this won’t come true. For Dodgers fans, pray L.A. is as committed to winning as they say they are, and get to work on negotiations ASAP.\n\nProposed blockbuster Giants trade sees San Francisco land $6.5 million All-Star ace, would create incredible 1-2 punch with Logan Webb\n\nDiamondbacks predicted to make blockbuster trade for $53 million All-Star ace to temporarily replace Corbin Burnes\n\nRed Sox receive seemingly advantageous update regarding NPB superstar, possible Alex Bregman replacement",

    "description": "Benjamin Morrison has missed practices, games and tackles. He’s given up huge pass plays against the Patriots and Bills.",
    "fullText": "Benjamin Morrison has missed practices, games and tackles. He’s given up huge pass plays against the Patriots and Bills.\n\nBut for the Bucs rookie cornerback, the biggest issue hasn’t been what happens when he’s on the field, it’s been staying healthy enough to get there.\n\nWith starting cornerback Zyon McCollum on injured reserve with a hip injury, Morrison, a second-round pick from Notre Dame, is being called upon again.\n\nBuy FIRE THE CANNONS: 50 Years of Tampa Bay Buccaneers Football\n\nWill the Panthers have success targeting Morrison Sunday in Charlotte, North Carolina, or will he rise to the occasion this time?\n\n“I think he’s finally healthy, so you’ll probably see the real Benjamin Morrison that we drafted,” Bucs coach Todd Bowles said on Friday. “He had a couple weeks to take in some things mentally and get physically right, so he’s probably in a place where it’s the best place he’s been in this year. So, I think you’ll see the best one we’ve seen.”\n\nThe last time we saw Morrison in a game, he was giving up a 72-yard touchdown pass to the Patriots’ Kyle Williams or losing sight of Bills receiver Tyrell Shavers as Josh Allen connected with him on a scramble drill in the end zone for a 43-yard score.\n\nMorrison has been recovering from a lingering hamstring injury that has kept him out of the past four games.\n\nBut with McCollum placed on injured reserve Monday, Morrison and rookie Jacob Parrish will be counted on to play the cornerback position opposite Jamel Dean.\n\n“It’s a huge opportunity, but at the end of the day it’s just football,” Morrison said. “I’m not going all into the logistics and things. I mean, we just had a walk-through Monday. I’m just wishing the best luck for Zyon. I mean, I’ve been in his shoes. My whole focus is to make sure he’s good and being the best teammate I can be for him.”\n\nOn the whole, Morrison actually has played pretty well this season.\n\nIn the Bucs’ Week 4 loss to the Eagles, he allowed only one catch for nine yards on four targets and broke up a pass intended for A.J. Brown.\n\nThrough Week 9, Morrison had been targeted 18 times, allowing nine catches for 129 yards and a touchdown, according to Pro Football Focus. At the time, his 50% catch rate was second among the top 13 rookie defensive backs with at least 100 coverage snaps.\n\nOverall, the Bucs pass defense has not been very good, to say the least. It ranks 31 in passing yards allowed, ahead of only the Cowboys. Teams are completing 66.8% of their passes, the seventh-highest percentage in the league.\n\nTheir lack of consistent pressure on the quarterback certainly has been a factor. Outside linebacker Yaya Diaby still leads the team in sacks with six.\n\nBecause Morrison plays best in a man-to-man scheme, the Bucs have struggled at times when they play zone. Couple that with the fact that both Morrison and Parrish could see significant playing time at cornerback against the Panthers.\n\n“It’s a matter of them getting over the rookie slump,” Bowles said. “It’s a long season. It’s probably twice as long as college, and then still maturing and realizing that everybody is going to play injured and hurt, and you’ve got to be mentally tough throughout. I think most of them have done that.”\n\nMorrison said he’s not thinking about how critical the next three games are, with two against the Panthers sandwiched around a game at Miami next week.\n\n“I’m taking them one at a time,” he said. “All I’m thinking about right now is Carolina. I don’t even know who we’re playing the second week or the third week, so just focus on the one we have in front of us.”\n\nThe Bucs sure don’t want to look behind them, having lost five of their past six, including defeats to the Saints and Falcons over a five-day span last week.\n\n“Obviously, we want to get back out there and just get that taste out of our mouths,” Morrison said. “But at the end of the day, we can dwell on it a little bit and give ourselves time to kind of reflect within, figure out what we can do from an individual standpoint, and now we come together as a team. Now we go from there.”\n\nDean recalled his rookie year, when he was pressed into service during a 2019 game at Seattle and allowed three touchdown passes.\n\nWhat can Morrison do to bounce back from some of the big plays he’s allowed this season?\n\n“I just tell them, man, just go out there and play your game,” Dean said. “You got the skill set, because they drafted you in the second round. It’s just a game we’ve been playing since we were a kid. You just keep playing. It’s not like your first time ever experiencing it.”\n\nat Panthers, 1 Sunday TV/radio: Fox; 97.9-FM Line/OU: Bucs by 3; 45 ½\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "fullText": "Although the transfer portal doesn’t open until Jan. 2, the quarterback market is starting to take shape. Multiple high-profile signal-callers announced their plans to hit the portal, and ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported how much the top QBs could make.\n\nThamel reported the “tip-top” of the quarterback market could reach $5 million. For comparison, Duke quarterback Darian Mensah was one of the highest-paid players in the country this past season at $4 million, On3’s Pete Nakos previously reported.\n\nMultiple big-name schools are expected to be looking for a quarterback in the portal this year, and names such as Brendan Sorsby, Dylan Raiola and Josh Hoover are already front-and-center. As a result, the market could surge, Thamel said.\n\n“This market looks robust already, guys. … I made some calls today. Sources told me the tip-top of this quarterback market, financially, could reach $5 million for one season,” Thamel said Friday on ESPN College GameDay. “Look, it’s supply and demand. You have all those guys. Sorsby’s been linked early to Texas Tech. Dylan Raiola, there’s some smoke to Louisville, although maybe a playoff team jumps in late there. There’s been early links between Indiana and Hoover, assuming that [Fernando] Mendoza goes pro.\n\n“Look, this is what’s going to drive the market. Oregon may lose Dante Moore, Miami’ll be in the quarterback market, so will LSU. So when you really take a look at what’s going to drive this quarterback market, it’s going to be the most expensive in the history of college football.”\n\nQuarterback remains one of the biggest positions in the transfer portal, especially considering the recent success. Seven of the last nine Heisman Trophy winners have been transfers, including Mendoza this year. DeVonta Smith and Bryce Young are the only ones to stay with their own program at Alabama and win the award during that time.\n\nLast year’s transfer quarterbacks were also among the highest-paid players in college football, On3 previously reported. Mensah’s $4 million payday was part of a two-year, $8 million deal at Duke. At Miami, Carson Beck inked a deal worth between $3 and $3.2 million, but up to $6 million with incentives.\n\nThe NCAA transfer portal window officially opens Jan. 2, meaning that’s when players’ names will start to appear. It will stay open for two weeks, closing Jan. 16.",

    "fullText": "Caroline Dubois produced a commanding performance on her American debut, outpointing Camilla Panatta to retain her WBC lightweight title in Miami.\n\nThe 24-year-old Londoner boxed with patience and control, showcasing her superior speed, timing and ring intelligence at the Kaseya Center.\n\nDubois dropped Panatta with a beautifully timed counter right in the sixth round before going on to win the 10-round contest by unanimous decision,\n\nAll three judges scored it 99-90.\n\n\"I felt like I could have done a little bit more, I give myself a B\", Dubois said, perhaps harsh in her own assessment.\n\nDubois was fighting for the first time under new promoters Most Valuable Promotions and on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's heavyweight bout against Jake Paul.\n\nShe extends her professional record to 12 wins and one draw, handing Panatta a third defeat in 12 fights.\n\nDubois fought early in the night on the prelims in front of a lightly filled Kaseya Center - the 20,000-seat home of the Miami Heat.\n\nShe walked to the ring singing along to Whitney Houston's 'I'm Every Woman' and started confidently, moving in and out of range and repeatedly beating Panatta to the punch.\n\nA straight left from the champion's southpaw stance landed cleanly and regularly in the third round as the gap in class became increasingly clear.\n\n\"Lovely, Caroline, keep going,\" shouted stablemate and former cruiserweight world champion Chris Billam-Smith from the crowd as Dubois pressed forward.\n\nDubois whipped a body shot into Panatta's midriff in the fifth and again in the sixth, each drawing nods of approval from ringside.\n\nMoments later came the knockdown. As Panatta dipped to attack the body, Dubois slipped the shot and fired a perfectly timed counter to the chin.\n\nPanatta, 34, crashed to the canvas in a heap.\n\nShe rose quickly but looked shaken; her brief grin doing little to disguise the effect of the punch.\n\nWith little time left in the round, Panatta managed to see out the bell.\n\nDubois increased the intensity in the closing stages, varying her work by mixing jabs and uppercuts, while a marked-up Panatta had few answers as the champion comfortably closed out the final rounds.\n\nIt meant there was little doubt when the scorecards were read out.\n\nDubois' move to MVP could prove pivotal in how quickly her career and profile now accelerates.\n\nThe promotional outfit, headed by Paul and CEO Nakisa Bidarian, has invested heavily in women's boxing and, after a period in which Dubois' progress threatened to stall, new opportunities are likely to open up.\n\nShe exchanged words with American super-featherweight champion Alycia Baumgardner at Wednesday's news conference, a potential future bout that would generate significant interest.\n\n\"Not next, but definitely down the line,\" Dubois said of Baumgardner.\n\nA unification fight with Doncaster's Terri Harper - the WBO champion and also signed to MVP - appears a realistic next step.\n\nElsewhere in the division, WBA champion Stephanie Han and Turkey's IBF title holder Elif Nur Turhan, who has eight knockouts in 12 wins, offer unification possibilities.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Prototaxites was an extinct lineage of multicellular terrestrial eukaryotes. Prototaxites was the first giant organism to live on the terrestrial surface, reaching sizes of 8 metres in the Early Devonian.\n\nHowever, its taxonomic assignment has been debated for over 165 years. Tentative assignments to groups of multicellular algae or land plants have been repeatedly ruled out based on anatomy and chemistry resulting in two major alternatives: Prototaxites was either a fungus or a now entirely extinct lineage.\n\nRecent studies have converged on a fungal affinity. Here we test this by contrasting the anatomy and molecular composition of Prototaxites with contemporary fungi from the 407-million-year-old Rhynie chert.\n\nWe report that Prototaxites taiti was the largest organism in the Rhynie ecosystem and its anatomy was fundamentally distinct from all known extant or extinct fungi. Furthermore, our molecular composition analysis indicates that cell walls of P. taiti include aliphatic, aromatic, and phenolic components most similar to fossilisation products of lignin, but no fossilisation products characteristic of chitin or chitosan, which are diagnostic of all groups of extant and extinct fungi, including those preserved in the Rhynie chert.\n\nWe therefore conclude that Prototaxites was not a fungus, and instead propose it is best assigned to a now entirely extinct terrestrial lineage.\n\nPrototaxites taiti material from the Rhynie chert. a-c, Images of two of the four thin sections containing the fragments that constitute the P. taiti type material, including medullary spots (b) and peripheral region (c). d-l: P. taiti material used in this study. d,e: d, Lyon 156 with P. taiti highlighted in dashed lines. e, thin section produced from the block in (d) showing the fractured P. taiti specimen. f, Magnified image of the thin section in (e) showing the characteristic tubes and medullary spots of P. taiti. g, h: g, thin section made from Lyon 48 with P. taiti in dashed box. h, detail of thin section in (g) showing the tubes. i m: Imaging and reconstruction of a large, exceptionally well-preserved P. taiti from NSC.36. i, Photogrammetry model of NSC.36 before cutting with surface exposed P. taiti circled by dashed line. j, Photogrammetry model of NSC.36 after initial cutting of the block with P. taiti circled by a dashed line. k, Block of NSC.36 from which thin sections were produced, showing medullary spots throughout the body. l, thin section taken from the block in (k) showing characteristic tubes and medullary spots of P. taiti. m, Artist reconstruction of P. taiti within the Rhynie ecosystem including hypothesised reconstruction of the aerial portion.

    "description": "LG says it’ll let people delete the Copilot icon. But TV chatbots aren’t going away.",
    "fullText": "Online fury erupted this week after an LG TV owner claimed that a firmware update installed unremovable generative AI software on their smart TV.\n\nThe controversy began on Saturday, when a Reddit user posted about the sudden appearance of a Microsoft Copilot icon on their device (something Windows users are all too familiar with). The Reddit user claimed that a “new software update installed Copilot” onto their LG TV and that it couldn’t be deleted.\n\n“Pre-installed crap is universally dogshit. If I wanted it, I’d have installed it myself eventually. The whole reason it’s bundled is because no one would choose it… Burn your television,” another Reddit user responded in the thread, which has 36,000 upvotes as of this writing.\n\nSome news outlets covered the move this week, reporting that LG customers were upset by an “unremovable Microsoft Copilot installation” and that other LG TV owners could expect to get it the next time they update their device.\n\nLG has since admitted that it used a webOS update to force Copilot onto some of its TVs. However, the firmware update didn’t install the Copilot application but rather a shortcut to the Copilot web app, which opens in the TV’s integrated web browser, LG spokesperson Chris De Maria told The Verge. De Maria added that “features such as microphone input are activated only with the customer’s explicit consent.”\n\nLG’s spokesperson said the company added the “shortcut icon to enhance customer accessibility and convenience.” LG, like other companies, has failed to prove why people need their non-computing devices, such as computer mice or earbuds, to provide instant access to third-party chatbots.\n\nFor those annoyed about the web app shortcut, De Maria said today that LG “will take steps to allow users to delete the shortcut icon if they wish.” He didn’t provide more details.\n\nEven with LG’s concession, it may become more difficult to avoid chatbots on TVs.\n\nLG says it will let people delete the Copilot icon from their TVs soon, but it still has plans to weave the service throughout webOS. The Copilot web app rollout seems to have been a taste of LG’s bigger plans to add Copilot to some of its 2025 OLED TVs. In a January announcement, LG said Copilot will help users find stuff to watch by “allowing users to efficiently find and organize complex information using contextual cues.” LG also said Copilot would “proactively” identify potential user problems and offer “timely, effective solutions.”\n\nSome TVs from LG’s biggest rival, Samsung, have included Copilot since August. Owners of supporting 2025 TVs can speak to Copilot using their remote’s microphone. They can also access Copilot via the Tizen OS homescreen’s Apps tab or through the TVs’ Click to Search feature, which lets users press a dedicated remote button to search for content while watching live TV or Samsung TV Plus. Users can also ask the TV to make AI-generated wallpapers or provide real-time subtitle translations.\n\nCopilot similarly rolled out automatically onto supporting Samsung TVs. Users can avoid Copilot by not using the above features, and they may be able to remove the Copilot icon from their TV’s Apps section.\n\nBut Copilot will still be integrated into Tizen OS, and Samsung appears eager to push chatbots into TVs, including by launching Perplexity’s first TV app. Amazon, which released Fire TVs with Alexa+ this year, is also exploring putting chatbots into TVs.\n\nAfter the backlash LG faced this week, companies may reconsider installing AI apps on people’s smart TVs. A better use of large language models in TVs may be as behind-the-scenes tools to improve TV watching. People generally don’t buy smart TVs to make it easier to access chatbots.\n\nBut this development is still troubling for anyone who doesn’t want an AI chatbot in their TV at all.\n\nSubtle integrations of generative AI that make it easier for people to do things like figure out the name of “that movie” may have practical use, but there are reasons to be wary of chatbot-wielding TVs.\n\nChatbots add another layer of complexity to understanding how a TV tracks user activity. With a chatbot involved, smart TV owners will be subject to complicated smart TV privacy policies and terms of service, as well as the similarly verbose rules of third-party AI companies. This will make it harder for people to understand what data they’re sharing with companies, and there’s already serious concern about the boundaries smart TVs are pushing to track users, including without consent.\n\nChatbots can also contribute to smart TV bloatware. Unwanted fluff, like games, shopping shortcuts, and flashy ads, already disrupts people who just want to watch TV.\n\nLG’s Copilot web app is worthy of some grousing, but not necessarily because of the icon that users will eventually be able to delete. The more pressing issue is the TV industry’s shift toward monetizing software with user tracking and ads.\n\nIf you haven’t already, now is a good time to check out our guide to breaking free from smart TV ads and tracking.",

    "fullText": "Let's set the stage a bit here. Imagine you're a solo dev who has that next big idea that's 100% very obviously going to change and revolutionize your industry. You for sure see patterns nobody else does, and you're determined to use a tool like Claude Code or Codex to vibe out a NextJS application that will definitely make you a million...no a billionaire.\n\nYou spin up your preferred terminal, type in claude or codex and speak your encantation into existence with:\n\nMake me a NextJS application that {insert revolutionary idea and goal}\n\nInstant profit right? Except that's not what happens. What happens is that you spend the next month trying to bring the initial output into a state where you can maybe even call it an MVP. You haven't even added two factor auth at this point, or added a single integration, and this is all due to one very common problem with vibe-coding. It's ham-fisted and ineffective.\n\nDelusions of grandeur aside, the draw of LLM-assisted development is am alluring one, and we'd be lying if we told you it's all just smoke and mirrors. There are some pre-experienced developers (Like us), who are building some incredibly complicated software with the help of LLMs such as Anthropic Claude and OpenAI Codex.\n\nSo what sets these development ventures apart from \"vibe-coders\"? At the core, it's planning. We all know about the trusty dusty agents.md file. I'm sure every marketing and rev ops professional in the world thought they we're Einstien the first time they discovered what a system prompt was. Yeah I'm speaking to you {anonymousId_123456} 😉. The agents.md file is really really neat headpats, but I promise there's a reason you haven't been able to replace your 30+ third-party vendors with Microsoft Copilot in a day. It's because you haven't taken the time to do things like:\n\nHaving even a foundational understanding of type theory and why it's important can be the difference in a successful LLM-assisted greenfield project and a failed experiment. We don't like failed experiments so we're going to give you the step by step into how we build projects here at Atelier Logos. We don't use tools like Github Spec-kit ourselves, but it's a great resource regardless.\n\nWe're perpetually amazed at how many Marketing Ops professionals out here who seem to just forget every bit of their foundational understanding of data structures when they open up an LLM tool. It's like we think just because it's \"AI\", it doesn't need structure (Remember guys, Terminator isn't real) and will just spit out whatever we want. Anytime we start a project, we first define the types and data model. This part doesn't even have to be done by hand, we use LLMs to draft the initial data model quite often.\n\nHere's an example binary.ts from our Fugu project which helps define a structure for binary analysis:\n\nAnyone who's done anything related to deconstructing binaries before knows that it's not an easy task. Granted, we used a OSS tool called Angr to help with a good portion of the legwork, but even then, we needed to define the structure so we could feed the output of Fugu/Angr CLI into our client application from the Rust side. You can see the results here.\n\nThe beauty of having strong typings with Typescript or Rust is that the LSP in a agentic IDE with automatically pick up when something is off and with the right model, automatically compensate for the typing structure you have. Without strong typings, the LLM has the potential to miss large swaths of structural issues in your code during it's iterations.\n\nOnce we nail down a schema, we plan out a directory structure that we can use as a sortof starter suggestion to an LLM tool such as Claude, and then we stub critical functionality such as helper functions, services files, and often we bring in our UI components in advance as well (We use ShadCN and 21st.dev pretty much exclusively).\n\nAfter we have a directory structure nailed down, we're ready to start banging out some initial prompt iterations and see the magic happen. What's amazing about this approach compared to \"vibe-coding\" is that our structure is already there, so the LLM has a lot less \"guessing\" it has to do to achieve optimal results. This is what will always set real developers using LLM tools apart from vibe coders, because now we can feed our types.ts schema into Claude Code for example, or use our directory structure with stubs inside as context for OpenAI Codex.\n\nAnd from here, it's just a matter of mixing and balancing our own intuition with the assistance of our chosen LLM tools.\n\nThe ability to iterate and iterate well with LLM-assisted software development is exponentially greater when you have a defined set of criteria, and you leave as little for the LLM to guess on as possible, while also allowing the agent to take advantage of types via the LSP to automatically fix structural issues.\n\nIf you'd like us to explore how we can use this approach to help you develop internal tools for your organization, schedule a time to chat with James today.",

    "title": "Wow! Signal",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal detected on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, then used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and bore expected hallmarks of extraterrestrial origin.\n\nAstronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. On the computer printout, he circled the reading of the signal's intensity, \"6EQUJ5\", and wrote the comment \"Wow!\" beside it, leading to the event's widely used name.[2]\n\nThe entire signal sequence lasted for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it. Despite numerous follow-up searches and hypotheses (including brief consideration of reflections from space debris, interstellar scintillation, and comet hydrogen clouds), the signal has never recurred, and no explanation, terrestrial or otherwise, has been confirmed. While some researchers have suggested it could represent an extraterrestrial transmission, its single occurrence and lack of replication limit the strength of this interpretation. The Wow! signal has inspired targeted searches, scientific discussion about rare astrophysical phenomena, and references in popular culture.\n\nIn a 1959 paper, Cornell University physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi had speculated that any extraterrestrial civilization attempting to communicate via radio signals might do so using a frequency of 1420 megahertz (21-centimeter spectral line), which is naturally emitted by hydrogen, the most common element in the universe and therefore likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.[3]\n\nIn 1973, after completing an extensive survey of extragalactic radio sources, Ohio State University assigned the now-defunct Ohio State University Radio Observatory (nicknamed \"Big Ear\") to the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), in the longest-running program of this kind in history.[4] The radio telescope was located near the Perkins Observatory on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio.[5]\n\nThe event was later documented in technical detail by the observatory's director.[6]\n\nThe string 6EQUJ5, commonly misinterpreted as a message encoded in the radio signal, represents in fact the signal's intensity variation over time, expressed in the particular measuring system adopted for the experiment. The signal itself appeared to be an unmodulated continuous wave, although any modulation with a period of less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable.[7][8]\n\nThe signal intensity was measured as signal-to-noise ratio, with the noise (or baseline) averaged over the previous few minutes. The signal was sampled for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. The result for each frequency channel was output on the printout as a single alphanumeric character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a dimensionless multiple of the signal's standard deviation.[9]\n\nIn this particular intensity scale, a space character denoted an intensity between 0 and 1, that is between baseline and one standard deviation above it. The numbers 1 to 9 denoted the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1 to 9); intensities of 10 and above were indicated by a letter: \"A\" corresponded to intensities between 10 and 11, \"B\" to 11 to 12, and so on. The Wow! signal's highest measured value was \"U\" (an intensity between 30 and 31), which is thirty standard deviations above background noise.[2][9]\n\nJohn Kraus, the director of the observatory, gave a value of 1420.3556 MHz in a 1994 summary written for Carl Sagan.[6] However, Ehman in 1998 gave a value of 1420.4556±0.005 MHz.[10] This is (50±5 kHz) above the hydrogen line value (with no red- or blue-shift) of 1420.4058 MHz. If due to blue-shift, it would correspond to the source moving about 10 km/s (6.2 mi/s) towards Earth.\n\nAn explanation of the difference between Ehman's value and Kraus's can be found in Ehman's paper. The first local oscillator in the telescope's radio receiver was specified to a frequency value of 1450.4056 MHz. However, the university's purchasing department made a typographical error in the order form, instead obtaining an oscillator with frequency 1450.5056 MHz (i.e., 0.1 MHz higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.[citation needed]\n\nThe Wow! signal had a bandwidth of less than 10 kHz. It is considered narrowband emission in the sense that its fractional bandwidth was relatively small (~0.001%). However, the 10 kHz bandwidth is not small compared to the bandwidth of some astrophysical masers (~1 kHz) or to the frequency resolution of modern narrowband SETI searches (~1 Hz).[11] The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty 10 kHz-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.[10]\n\nAt the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for altitude (or height above the horizon), and relied on the rotation of the Earth to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.[12] A continuous extraterrestrial signal, therefore, would be expected to register for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded intensity of such signal would display a gradual increase for the first 36 seconds—peaking at the center of the observation window—and then a gradual decrease as the telescope moved away from it. All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.[13][14]\n\nThe precise location in the sky where the signal apparently originated is uncertain due to the design of the Big Ear telescope, which featured two feed horns, each receiving a beam from slightly different directions, while following Earth's rotation. The Wow! signal was detected in one beam but not in the other, and the data was processed in such a way that it is impossible to determine which of the two horns received the signal.[15] There are, therefore, two possible right ascension (RA) values for the location of the signal (expressed below in terms of the two main reference systems):[16]\n\nIn contrast, the declination was unambiguously determined to be as follows:\n\nThe galactic coordinates for the positive horn are l=11.7°, b=−18.9°, and for the negative horn l=11.9°, b=−19.5°, both being therefore about 19° toward the southeast of the galactic plane, and about 24° or 25° east of the Galactic Center. The region of the sky in question lies northwest of the globular cluster M55, in the constellation Sagittarius, roughly 2.5 degrees south of the fifth-magnitude star group Chi Sagittarii, and about 3.5 degrees south of the plane of the ecliptic. The closest easily visible star is Tau Sagittarii.[17]\n\nInitially, no nearby Sun-like stars were known to lie within the antenna coordinates, although in any direction the antenna pattern would encompass about six distant Sun-like stars as estimated in 2016.[7] In 2022, a paper published in the International Journal of Astrobiology identified three likely Sun-like stars within the antenna-pointed coordinates. The better characterized star, 2MASS 19281982-2640123, is located 1,800 light years away, only 132 light years away from Maccone's estimation where an intelligent civilization is more likely to exist.[18] The other two candidates, 2MASS 19252173-2713537 and 2MASS 19282229-2702492, were insufficiently characterized but still likely to be Sun-like stars. Also, 14 other catalogued stars at the antenna coordinates may still turn out to be similar to the Sun after more data becomes available.[19][20][21] As a response to the discovery, Breakthrough Listen conducted the first targeted search for the Wow! Signal in its first collaboration between the Green Bank Telescope and the Allen Telescope Array of the SETI Institute.[22][23] The observations were performed on May 21, 2022, lasting 1 hour from Greenbank, 35 minutes from ATA, and 9 minutes and 40 seconds simultaneously.[24] No technosignature candidates were found.[25]\n\nInterstellar scintillation of a weaker continuous signal—similar in effect to atmospheric twinkling—could be an explanation, but that would not exclude the possibility of the signal being artificial in origin. The significantly more sensitive Very Large Array did not detect the signal, and the probability that a signal below the detection threshold of the Very Large Array could be detected by the Big Ear due to interstellar scintillation is low.[26][failed verification] Other hypotheses include a rotating lighthouse-like source, a signal sweeping in frequency, or a one-time burst.[16]\n\nEhman said in 1994: \"We should have seen it again when we looked for it 50 times. Something suggests it was an Earth-sourced signal that simply got reflected off a piece of space debris.\"[27] He later somewhat recanted his skepticism, after further research showed the unrealistic requirements that a space-borne reflector would need to have to produce the observed signal.[10]\nThe signal's frequency of 1420 MHz is also part of a protected spectrum:[28][29] a frequency range reserved for astronomical research in which terrestrial transmissions are forbidden, although a 2010 study documented several instances of terrestrial sources either interfering from adjacent frequency bands or illegally transmitting within the spectrum.[30] In a 1997 paper, Ehman resists \"drawing vast conclusions from half-vast data\"—acknowledging the possibility that the source may have been military or otherwise a product of Earth-bound sources.[31] In a 2019 interview with John Michael Godier, Ehman stated: \"I'm convinced that the Wow! signal certainly has the potential of being the first signal from extraterrestrial intelligence.\"[32]\n\nMETI president Douglas Vakoch told Die Welt that any putative SETI signal detections must be replicated for confirmation, and the lack of such replication for the Wow! signal means it has little credibility.[33]\n\nIn August 2024, the Planetary Habitability Laboratory published a preprint reporting observations made in 2020 at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico—where they conclude that the Wow! signal was likely caused by a rare astrophysical event, in which stellar emissions energizing a cold hydrogen cloud caused it to suddenly surge in brightness.[34][35]\n\nIn 2017, Antonio Paris, Assistant Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at St. Petersburg College, Florida,[36] proposed that the hydrogen cloud surrounding two comets, 266P/Christensen and 335P/Gibbs, now known to have been in the same region of the sky, could have been the source of the Wow! signal.[37][38][39] This hypothesis was dismissed by astronomers, including members of the original Big Ear research team, as the cited comets were not in the beam at the correct time. Furthermore, comets do not emit strongly at the frequencies involved, and there is no explanation for why a comet would be observed in one beam but not in the other.[40][41][42]\n\nSeveral attempts were made by Ehman and other astronomers to recover and identify the signal. The signal was expected to occur three minutes apart in each of the telescope's feed horns, but that did not happen.[14] Ehman unsuccessfully searched for recurrences using Big Ear in the months after the detection.[26]\n\nIn 1987 and 1989, Robert H. Gray searched for the event using the META array at Oak Ridge Observatory, but did not detect it.[26][43][page needed] In a July 1995 test of signal detection software to be used in its upcoming Project Argus, SETI League executive director H. Paul Shuch made several drift-scan observations of the Wow! signal's coordinates with a 12-meter radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, also achieving a null result.\n\nIn 1995 and 1996, Gray again searched for the signal using the Very Large Array, which is significantly more sensitive than Big Ear.[26][43][page needed] Gray and Simon Ellingsen later searched for recurrences of the event in 1999 using the 26-meter radio telescope at the University of Tasmania's Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory.[44] Six 14-hour observations were made at positions in the vicinity, but nothing like the Wow! signal was detected.[14][43][page needed]\n\nIn 2012, on the 35th anniversary of the Wow! signal, the Arecibo Observatory was said to have beamed a digital stream towards Hipparcos 34511, 33277, and 43587.[45] The transmission consisted of approximately 10,000 Twitter messages solicited for the purpose by the National Geographic Channel, bearing the hashtag \"#ChasingUFOs\" (a promotion for one of the channel's TV series).[46] The sponsor also included a series of video vignettes featuring verbal messages from various celebrities.[47] According to Robert Kerr, the former director of the Arecibo Observatory who oversaw the Wow! reply, the transmitter overheated shortly into the first transmission, and it was only sent in the direction of one of the targets. It is unknown how many tweets made it through. None of the targeted stars are within the possible region from which the Wow! signal came.[48]\n\nTo increase the probability that any extraterrestrial recipients would recognize the signal as an intentional communication from another intelligent life form, Arecibo scientists attached a repeating-sequence header to each individual message.[46]\n\nThe signal was featured in the 2024 television series 3 Body Problem, in which the signal is also detected in Inner Mongolia.[49] The signal was also referenced in the 1994 season 2 premier of The X-Files, \"Little Green Men\".",

    "description": ": Ofcom survey finds 18-34s increasingly see life online as bad for society and their mental health",
    "fullText": "Young Brits are souring on the internet, with increasing numbers seeing it as damaging to society and their mental health, according to latest research published by Ofcom.\n\nThe UK's communications regulator found that in June 2025, just a third of those aged 18-34 agreed the internet is good for society, down from 42 percent a year earlier. While this fell for older age groups as well, it did so less sharply (34 percent versus 38 percent in 2024), meaning those aged 55 and above are proportionately more positive than younger people about the internet's impact on civilization.\n\nThe research also found that more young adults disagreed the internet helps their mental health than agreed, reversing the previous year's findings. In June 2025, 35 percent of young adults disagreed that being online had a positive overall effect on their emotional wellbeing, while 31 percent agreed. In June 2024, 28 percent disagreed and 39 agreed.\n\nThe questions were part of annual research carried out in the summer by pollster YouGov with 7,340 adults of all ages for Ofcom's Annual Online Nation report.\n\nDespite their increasing negativity, young adults in the UK spend significantly more time online than older age groups, averaging six hours and 20 minutes a day on personal (rather than work) devices, up ten minutes over the prior 12 months and much higher than the four hours and 30 minutes for all adults.\n\nSo why are many of these digital natives, born between Sir Tim Berners-Lee's creation of the first web browser and server in 1990 and Apple's launch of the first iPhone in 2007, losing faith in the internet?\n\nOne reason may be that their online experiences differ significantly from those of their elders, including more material chosen by algorithms than actively selected by users.\n\nA section of the research on potentially harmful online encounters found younger adults were most likely to have experienced these on Instagram, followed by TikTok. Overall, Facebook was the place people were most likely to encounter such material, but the likelihood of this increased with age. Among all young adults, 47 percent of potentially harmful encounters came from scrolling a feed, compared with just 26 percent for 55s and over.\n\nAnother reason may be increasing interest in how the internet can damage young people, even if this tends to focus on those a bit younger than the group in question.\n\nThis year's Ofcom research took place a few months after the March launch of Adolescence, a UK drama about a teenage murder suspect who was radicalized online, which was Netflix's most-watched show worldwide in the first half of this year. It was also shortly before Ofcom started enforcing the UK's Online Safety Act, which attempts to restrict content for those under 16, and Australia attempted to stop the same age group from operating social media accounts.\n\nOfcom did find that young adults are more likely than older groups to manage their internet use by disabling notifications, using Do Not Disturb settings, pausing use of services, and deleting apps.\n\nA fifth felt they did not have a good balance between online and offline, compared with 13 percent of all adults. However, the group was less likely than older adults to report or flag potentially harmful content, with more than half choosing not to act on this type of material, saying they didn't consider it to be serious or harmful enough. ®",

    "description": "The Kennedy Center added Donald Trump's name to its facade on Friday. Here's a look back at how it came to be and how it has changed under Trump.",
    "fullText": "With his White House renovations already underway, President Donald Trump is now leaving his mark on the Kennedy Center.\n\nThe day after the Kennedy Center's board of trustees voted to change the name, new signage appeared on the building's facade on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\nOriginally established by Congress in 1958 as an \"artistic mecca\" for the performing arts in the nation's capital, the National Cultural Center was officially renamed in memory of President John F. Kennedy after his assassination in 1963. Since its opening in 1971, the center has hosted the Kennedy Center Honors, as well as a range of events and exhibits across genres.\n\nSince the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, changing its name requires congressional approval. That hasn't stopped the Center's Trump-appointed board from implementing the change on the building as well as its website. Whether the name sticks remains to be seen.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how the Center came to be and its changes under Trump's leadership so far.\n\nOriginally named the National Cultural Center, the act authorized the construction of the building and established it as an independent institution with a mission to host arts and culture events, as well as educational programming.\n\nKennedy Onassis and Mamie Eisenhower served as honorary co-chairwomen of the project.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the John F. Kennedy Center Act in January 1964 to change the name and provide $23 million in federal funds for its construction.\n\nAfter signing the bill, Johnson handed the pen to Edward Kennedy, John F. Kennedy's brother.\n\n\"As this center comes to reflect and advance the greatness of America, consider then those glories were purchased by a valiant leader who never swerved from duty — John Kennedy. And in his name I dedicate this site,\" Johnson said at the groundbreaking ceremony, held in December 1964.\n\nDesigned by architect Edward Durell Stone, the Kennedy Center was built on the banks of the Potomac River using 3,700 tons of marble gifted to the US from Italy.\n\nFor its opening event, the Kennedy Center hosted a performance of \"Mass\" by Leonard Bernstein, which was commissioned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nThe first Kennedy Center honorees included Fred Astaire, Marian Anderson, George Balanchine, Arthur Rubinstein, and Richard Rodgers.\n\nBeyoncé brought the Kennedy Center to its feet with a fiery tribute to Tina Turner in 2005, and President Barack Obama shed tears while watching Aretha Franklin perform \"Natural Woman\" to honor Carole King in 2015.\n\nTrump did not attend the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, but has taken a much more active role in shaping the institution in his second non-consecutive term.\n\nAfter taking office earlier this year, he fired the president and Biden-appointed members of the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, replacing them with allies and members of his administration. The board went on to elect Trump as its chairman.\n\nWhile visiting the performance venue in March, Trump told board members that the building was in \"bad shape\" and said he planned to renovate the space.\n\n\"We're going to make a lot of changes, including the seats, the décor, pretty much everything needs a lot of work,\" he said.\n\nAt the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors, held on December 7, honorees received newly designed medallions from Tiffany, featuring blue ribbons instead of the traditional rainbow colors.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House announced that the board had \"unanimously\" voted to change the name from the Kennedy Center to the Trump Kennedy Center, and the website was updated to reflect the change.\n\nTrump's name was added to the building's signage on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\n\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Roma Daravi, the center's vice president of public relations, said in a statement to Business Insider. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"\n\nTrump said he was \"honored,\" while Democratic lawmakers and members of the Kennedy family criticized the president.\n\nKennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, contested the White House's claim of a unanimous vote, writing on X that \"microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous,\" while Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, wrote on X that the change is not acceptable.\n\nSix Democratic lawmakers said in a statement that Trump was \"attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Radio legend Delilah opens up about motherhood, love, and how her callers keep her focused on gratitude and joy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Delilah Rene Luke, voice of the Sonos Holiday Party Prep Talk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up with parents who didn't believe women should work. My mom never held a job outside the house. But like a lot of other values my parents had that I felt were BS, I just did what I was going to do. I was always ambitious and didn't mind what they thought of it.\n\nAt first, being a DJ was a means to an end. I wanted to go to med school, but after failing organic chemistry, I realized medicine wasn't where my gift was. Then, I learned how much one of my professors was making. I was making almost as much, with no education, working a job that I loved. I thought, why not stick with this?\n\nMy definition of success is different from many people. I believe if you love your life and you're kind to people, you are successful. It doesn't matter if you have a degree or a lot of money — if you're not working to make the world a better place, you're not a success in my book.\n\nThere's a song, \"That Don't Impress Me Much.\" Not only does wealth without purpose not impress me — it disgusts me. I prioritize giving back, especially to kids in foster care. I collaborated with Sonos after they made a donation to my charity, PointHope, which supports children in foster care and in African refugee camps. That generosity brings tears to my eyes.\n\nI always wanted a big family, but to me, that means four to six kids. I have 15 now, and my husband has five. Many of them were adopted from foster care. Only two adoptions were planned, but the rest came into my life, and they needed a mother. In one case, I learned my adopted son had biological siblings in foster care who needed a home. Now, I also have 25 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\n\nI want my legacy with them to be love. When I was younger, I thought love was all warm, happy feelings. It's not. Love is saying, \"Yes, I'm going to be there for you through the hard stuff. I'm never going to give up on you or walk away. I'm never going to leave you wondering.\"\n\nThat's the most important thing in life. It's not what you produce, or buy, or what car you drive: it's love.\n\nMy parents always made the holidays super special, even though we didn't have a lot of money. They made most of our gifts, and we cut down our own Christmas tree. If it didn't have enough branches, my dad would drill a hole and stuff more branches in.\n\nI try to make the holidays as special for my kids and grandkids as they were for me. I love baking and crafting (this week I'm painting snowmen for all the kids). My 16-year-old is hosting a holiday sleepover this weekend — her idea, not mine.\n\nI don't worry about everything looking perfect. I don't have anything matching in my house: not matching plates, silverware, or mugs. I prefer plastic plates: there's less to clean up at the end. The one thing that matches — our holiday pajamas! Do you know how hard it is to get 20 pairs of matching pajamas?\n\nAt work, we start working on our holiday show in August or September. If a caller has a particularly great story, I take their number and ask if I can call them back later in the year.\n\nI know if they're articulate about their joy that their child is going to college, they'll have something to be grateful for come Thanksgiving. My callers have shown me that despite all the problems in the world, there's so much to celebrate.",

    "description": "From \"Euphoria\" to \"The Housemaid,\" here are Sydney Sweeney's best and worst movie and TV roles according to critics on Rotten Tomatoes.",
    "fullText": "It may seem like Sydney Sweeney's rise to stardom happened overnight, but the 28-year-old has been acting for most of her life.\n\nSince her first appearance on screen as a scared child in 2010's forgettable \"ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction,\" she's been on the grind, building her credits and landing the occasional guest spot on shows like \"Pretty Little Liars\" and \"The Handmaid's Tale.\"\n\nFinally, she hit it big when she landed role of Cassie Howard in the HBO series \"Euphoria,\" which premiered in 2019. Since then, she's shot up the Hollywood ranks starring in a string of hits, from season one of \"The White Lotus\" to the 2023 hit rom-com \"Anyone But You.\" This year, she physically transformed for the boxing biopic \"Christy,\" and can next be seen starring alongside Amanda Seyfried in the big screen adaptation of Freida McFadden's book \"The Housemaid.\"\n\nBelow, a look at Sydney Sweeney's best and worst movie and TV credits, according to the critic scores on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nAll scores are accurate as of publication but are subject to change.\n\nSweeney tried to get a piece of the Marvel pie by starring opposite Dakota Johnson in this Spider-Women origin story.\n\nBut with disastrous box office and even worse reviews, all involved moved on.\n\nHistorically, rom-coms don't connect with critics, and this one is no different.\n\nHowever, box office doesn't lie; the combination of Sweeney and Glen Powell caused a sensation.\n\nThough it was directed by Ron Howard and stars Jude Law, Vanessa Kirby, and Ana de Armas, this true-life thriller in which Sweeney plays one of the original settlers of Floreana Island, in the Galápagos Islands, didn't connect with critics.\n\nIf Sweeney was excited to be cast in director David Robert Mitchell's follow-up to his hit 2014 horror movie \"It Follows,\" that likely dissipated when she saw that her name on the cast list was \"Shooting Star #2.\"\n\nShe had almost zero screen time and played an escort.\n\nSweeney landed a solid performance in this trippy drama — though you likely didn't see it, as it was released during the height of COVID.\n\nIn this thriller from Blumhouse, Sweeney stars alongside Madison Iseman as twins who get competitive when one outshines the other while attending a prestigious school for classical musicians.\n\nThis modern-day Western crime thriller with Tarantino and Coen brothers vibes stars Sweeney as a waitress with aspirations of being a country singer. She teams with a friend (Paul Walter Hauser) to try to steal a rare Native American artifact. But things get complicated when others also try to get their hands on it.\n\nThis outlandish low-budget horror movie marks Sweeney's screen debut. It's quite memorable, as her one scene in the movie ends with her getting blindsided by an SUV.\n\nSweeney goes all in playing former pro boxer Christy Martin and delivers a believable performance. Though critics were mixed, the movie has only made around $2 million at the box office. That won't get it done when you're looking for awards consideration.\n\nWith \"Immaculate,\" Sweeney chose the right horror movie this time. Here, she plays an American nun who travels to a remote Italian convent, where she endures horrific terrors.\n\nBefore \"Euphoria,\" Sweeney thought this Netflix teen series, in which she played moody drama club member Emaline, would be her big break. Though the series had strong reviews, the streamer scrapped it after one season.\n\nSweeney stars as a young woman who, looking for a fresh start, takes a job as a live-in maid. But the wealthy couple (Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar) who hired her are harboring some dark and twisted secrets.\n\nSweeney shows up in the finale of season 7 playing a high school friend of Addison (Ava Allan).\n\nIn this indie, Sweeney plays the girlfriend of Pete Davidson's drug-dealing character.\n\nSweeney's role as Cassie Howard in \"Euphoria\" also charts her evolution as an actor. This is most evident in season two, when Cassie steals Nate (Jacob Elordi) from Maddy (Alexa Demie), leading to major drama and one famous tear-filled breakdown. She received an Emmy nomination for her work in season two.\n\nIn season one of the HBO anthology series, Sweeney plays Olivia, a college student who goes on a trip to the luxurious Hawaiian resort with her wealthy family and college friend. She would score another Emmy nomination for her performance.\n\nSweeney appeared in a handful of episodes in season two as the child bride Eden Spencer.\n\nThough the limited series is based on the Gillian Flynn book, Sweeney's character was created for the show.\n\nSweeney plays Alice, the troubled roommate of Amy Adams' character in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nCritics praised Sweeney for her performance as Reality Winner, a former NSA contractor who leaked classified documents about Russian interference in the 2016 US elections to the media.",

    "description": "TikTok's new US joint venture will hand over national-security related tasks to its partners, while ByteDance holds onto key business lines.",
    "fullText": "Is TikTok really selling its US business? Kind of.\n\nTikTok has reached an agreement that would give it a new set of owners in the US as part of a joint-venture agreement. Larry Ellison's Oracle, Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, and private-equity firm Silver Lake are all coming on as managing investors in the US spin-off.\n\nBut how much influence will these investors have over the money-making side of the business? Not much, according to an internal memo TikTok CEO Shou Chew sent to employees on Thursday, viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe new investors will focus on national security-related tasks, such as data management and algorithm training, while TikTok's current owner, ByteDance, will remain in charge of key business lines, including e-commerce and advertising.\n\nHere's what Chew told staff about the arrangement:\n\nAs laid out by Chew, TikTok's new investors aren't going to be in the driver's seat on core business lines like TikTok Shop or ad sales, even if they may still participate in the profits of the business. TikTok global, which will remain under ByteDance, will still run the show.\n\n\"Advertisers will continue to connect with global audiences with no impact,\" Chew also wrote in the memo.\n\nThe setup, which focuses a lot more on national security-related concerns than business tasks, may be why the White House said in September the deal would be valued at $14 billion, far lower than the $50 billion estimate from Morningstar analysts in June. My colleague Peter Kafka previously dug into the TikTok valuation question.\n\nIn the proposed structure of the deal, which Chew said should close in late January, Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX will get a combined 45% stake in the US joint venture. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will grab around 30% ownership, and an unnamed group of new investors will take 5%.\n\nByteDance will maintain ownership of just under 20% of the US business, but retain oversight of the rest of the world and manage TikTok US's e-commerce, advertising, and marketing strategies.\n\nThat sounds like a pretty good setup for a company that spent much of 2024 and 2025 fighting to keep its US business alive after Congress passed a law forcing it to sell its US app or face a potential ban.\n\nThe question of who will actually be in charge of different parts of the business is paramount to employees at TikTok and ByteDance. Will they get a new boss or organizational structure after an agreement closes?\n\n\"Even though there's a deal, it doesn't say concretely yet what it means for us,\" one TikTok staffer said. They added that they weren't anticipating much change.\n\nTikTok, ByteDance, and MGX did not respond to requests for comment. Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment.",

    "description": "Iowa 80 in Walcott, Iowa stretches 150 football fields and serves 350,000 meals a year. It's more than just a stop on the road for truckers, though.",
    "fullText": "I've often driven past truckers feeling frustrated by their slow speed or uneasy that one might merge into my lane. I never gave much thought to who was behind the wheel.\n\nHowever, Iowa 80, the world's largest truck stop, cracked my heart open a bit.\n\nIowa 80's been dubbed the \"Disney World\" for truckers, but it's much more than its flashy signs, lines of semis, and large buffet. It's a home away from home for the people who move 70% — $13 trillion worth — of the goods Americans eat and buy.\n\nIowa 80 is a place where truckers can find some temporary peace, a shower, and even a dental exam. I was surprised to learn just how important a truck stop like this can be for people bound to the highways.\n\nIt sits along I-80 in Walcott, Iowa, and spans 225 acres. It has 900 parking spots, nine restaurants, 24 showers, and a massive chrome shop.\n\nIt's not in any world record books, though. After decades of folks saying, \"This has got to be the biggest truck stop in the world,\" the family behind Iowa 80 adopted the name. Now it's on dozens of signs around the property.\n\nIowa 80 is in a prime location, along one of America's busiest highways that connects New York City and Chicago to Des Moines and San Francisco. Plus, as the nation's top producer of corn and eggs, Iowa is a major agricultural shipping hub.\n\nWhat sets this truck stop apart, besides its size, is that it's one of the few mom-and-pop ones still around.\n\nOwned by the Moon family since 1964, Iowa 80 always has parking. Its main restaurant makes a surprising amount of food from scratch. It's a welcome change, truckers told me, from the big chains, like TA or Pilot, which often have full parking lots and fuel stations and only offer fast food to eat.\n\nI knew it was going to be big. But even I had underestimated the size. When I walked in, I thought, 'How on Earth am I going to see it all?'\n\nBig guys with their big gulps parted ways under the old-timey truck hanging over the entrance.\n\nWalking in, it felt like a shopping mall, complete with a food court filled with Orange Julius, Wendy's, and Taco Bell. On the right, the Iowa 80 Kitchen churned out homemade meals that were delicious.\n\nIt's no surprise they're working with a huge quantity of food. In their 61 years, they've gone through 23 million eggs. Bacon is one of the first things to hit the ovens each morning. The staff has to juggle both breakfast and lunch prep early to beat the rush.\n\nFor its size, I expected a lot of the food to be frozen. Indeed, the scrambled eggs and biscuits did arrive pre-cooked and frozen. However, most of the main dishes were cranked out by hand.\n\nChef Chris Han uses her grandfather's recipe for meatloaf, which includes chopped onions, celery, a tomato sauce mixture, breadcrumbs, and ground beef. She incorporates it all together in a 40-year-old mixer.\n\nThe cooks told me they tried to switch to pre-made ranch dressing, but there was an uproar among customers. So they went back to mixing it themselves. Mayo arrives in big buckets. That gets mixed with six gallons of buttermilk and nine packets of ranch seasoning.\n\nDiners have two options at Iowa 80 Kitchen. They can either pay for the buffet for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Or they can order off the expansive menu.\n\nThe Hungryman is a crowd favorite, with three kinds of meat, hash browns, eggs, and pancakes. When it hit my table, I couldn't believe people finish it.\n\nThese are sweet cream pancakes, which means they're made with heavy cream instead of milk or buttermilk. This swap felt like a brilliant indulgence to me.\n\nDespite sitting out for a bit while we took pictures, these pancakes had an incredible crisp on the outside. On the inside, they were still fluffy and almost gooey. I loved the unique tang to them.\n\nThis dish sang of Midwest comfort. I grew up a few hours south of Iowa 80, and it reminded me of my mom's recipe (I plead the fifth on which is better). It was warm, melty, and full of interesting textures, thanks to the breadcrumbs and celery.\n\nThe truckers I spoke to said that it's easy to get obese working as professional drivers. Most truck stops only have fast food options.\n\nThat's why Iowa 80 Kitchen means so much to them. It's a warm, home-cooked meal, they said. I wondered if that sentiment would excuse the few things that arrived frozen.\n\nLee Meier, granddaughter of the founders and the current marketing manager, took me on a tour of the massive truck stop. She explained that they wanted to include all these amenities — like 24 showers, a small gym, a laundry room, and a truck wash — so drivers wouldn't have to do errands in the precious hours they have at home with their families.\n\nWhen we poked our heads in around 2 p.m., there was no one in the 60-seat theatre. Disney's \"Cars\" played to an empty room.\n\nSeeing the movie selection gave me a jolt of excitement and nostalgia. It felt like I was a kid again, looking at that cool friend's massive collection of DVDs. I wanted more than anything to stay and cozy up to a movie.\n\nIt struck me that if a trucker has a toothache, they can't pull their rig into a neighborhood dentist. Which is why a dentist at a truck stop could be so valuable.\n\nI didn't get a chance to talk to the chiropractor, but Lee told me that many drivers experience back pain from being seated for 10 hours a day.\n\nTruckers can get new headlights, fenders, hood ornaments, seats, electronics, and horns. Iowa 80 also has a Truck Service Center that can repair any semi.\n\nAnd for drivers who might need inspiration for decorating their vehicle, there's even a trucking museum on the property, featuring over 100 antique rigs on display.\n\nDrivers told me that just to get some sleep, they have to fight for a parking spot at the most common truck stops, like TA and Pilot, but after 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., it's impossible to find one.\n\nThat's why you'll sometimes see rigs pulled over on the shoulder of a highway onramp to sleep, which can be unsafe if there's heavy traffic.\n\nEven with hundreds of trucks settled in by the time we left at 5 p.m., the lot was nowhere near full. I can see why this is an important feature for tired drivers.",

    "description": "Stagflation, a scenario where growth is sluggish while inflation remains elevated, is one of the biggest risks the Fed faces in 2026, Apollo said.",
    "fullText": "A top economist is back with a stagflation warning.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said he believes stagflation is still one of the biggest risks facing the Federal Reserve next year, even as investors breathe a sigh of relief after a light November inflation print.\n\nThat risk is jeopardizing a key source of fuel for the stock market rally: the prospect of more rate cuts.\n\n\"I still think that stagflation is a risk because there's still some headwinds coming, especially if AI does not deliver,\" Sløk said, pointing to the downside risks to growth and upside risks to consumer prices heading into the new year.\n\n\"Given that inflation is very sticky and now has the risk of going up over the next six months, then the key issue for the FOMC becomes: can we even cut in that environment?\" he later added.\n\nStagflation, which is often referred to by market pundits as one of the worst-case scenarios for the economy, describes a situation where growth remains sluggish while inflation remains elevated. That's a difficult combo for policymakers to respond to, as hot inflation prevents the Fed from cutting interest rates to boost economic growth.\n\nOn paper, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction. GDP is expected to have expanded a robust 3.5% over the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed economists, while inflation cooled to a 2.7% year-over-year pace, per the November CPI report.\n\nBut the US's vulnerability to stagflation is real, Sløk suggested. He pointed to the risk that AI firms will start to slow their spending on the technology, or that the billions they've already poured into AI won't produce the returns investors are expecting.\n\nMeanwhile, the ISM Services Prices Index, one forward-looking inflation indicator, clocked in at 65.4% in November, well within expansionary territory.\n\nCentral bankers also seem to be worried about stagflation, Sløk said. The number of FOMC members who said they believed the risks to inflation and unemployment were skewed to the upside far outnumbered those who said they believed risks were skewed to the downside, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"In other words, the Fed continues to forecast stagflation and is concerned that we in 2026 may experience rising inflation and rising unemployment at the same time,\" Sløk wrote.\n\n\"The bottom line is, in the next six months, and especially when we get to April, we'll begin to see some fairly meaningful risks that inflation is still going to be elevated,\" he later told CNBC.\n\nThe outlook for rate cuts looks dim heading into the new year. The probability that the Fed will trim rates another 25 basis points in January ticked up following the November CPI report, but investors are largely expecting the central bank to keep rates steady at its next policy meeting, with the odds of a cut at the March meeting at just 45%, per the CME FedWatch tool.",

    "description": "In her new docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" Taylor Swift talks about the beginning of her relationship with Travis Kelce and dating athletes.",
    "fullText": "If pop star Taylor Swift and elite athlete Travis Kelce seem like an unexpected match from the outside, Swift isn't surprised to hear that — she once felt the same way.\n\nIn her Disney+ docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" Swift opens up about the beginning of her relationship with Kelce and why she was initially hesitant to date her now-fiancé.\n\n\"I'd been very non-athlete. Because I'm not one. And I've always just been like, 'Well, what would we talk about?'\" Swift says in episode four, \"Thank You For the Lovely Bouquet.\"\n\nIndeed, Swift says that during her first date with Kelce, \"he literally had to explain football as if it were violent chess, which kind of helped me understand it.\"\n\nSwift also reveals that her mom, Andrea Swift, was the one who encouraged her to give Kelce a chance. Andrea had seen headlines about Kelce attending one of the Eras Tour stops at Arrowhead Stadium, his home field with the Kansas City Chiefs, and saying on his podcast that he'd hoped to meet Swift before the show and give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number.\n\nAndrea says in the docuseries that she was impressed by the \"earnest\" gesture and found it promising that Kelce would engage with the details of Swift's world, like making a friendship bracelet. She asked around about Kelce, and her cousin, a big Chiefs fan, told her that Kelce was known as \"the nicest guy\" who loves his mom.\n\n\"And so you call me up,\" Swift explains, addressing Andrea, \"with this tone of like, 'Hey, I know you're gonna not react well to this. But there's a guy.' You said something to the effect of, 'You've gotta start doing something different.'\"\n\nBefore Kelce, Swift's public relationships were almost always with artist types, usually movie stars or musicians like Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, and Calvin Harris. Most notably, Swift dated British actor Joe Alwyn for about six years. Their split was announced soon after the Eras Tour kicked off in early 2023.\n\nWeeks later, Swift was romantically linked to The 1975 front man Matty Healy. After about one month of public outings and strong objections from Swift's fans, TMZ broke the news that Swift was single again.\n\nSwift released her 11th album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" in 2024. The 31-song tracklist features recurring themes of heartbreak, alienation, and romantic disillusionment. Swift characterizes the album as a \"purge of everything bad that I felt for two years.\"\n\n\"It was a really rough time in my life, so the songs reflect that — feeling like I'm not a person, I'm just like, this big conglomerate that no one sees as a real human being, and especially not men that I date,\" she explains in the docuseries. \"And in the whole process, just being like, 'Nothing works. There is no one for me in the world.'\"\n\n\"I went through two breakups on the first half of this tour,\" she adds, \"and that's a lot of breakups, actually. The show was what gave me purpose.\"\n\nSwift's latest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" was largely written during the second half of the Eras Tour. It features overt references to her relationship with Kelce, who got down on one knee shortly before the album's release.\n\nDespite Swift's fears that she wouldn't have anything in common with a football player, she now believes her and Kelce's careers are more similar than not.\n\n\"We both have jobs where we go out in NFL stadiums, and we entertain people for three and a half hours,\" Swift says. \"It's our passion. We've been chasing this since we were little kids. I don't think I ever thought I'd meet a guy who had that same trajectory.\"\n\n\"Travis is just very comfortable with, conceptually speaking, a big life,\" she adds. \"Because he has one, and it's not one that he has reluctantly.\"\n\nIn the final scene of episode four, Kelce is shown waiting below the stage for Swift to finish one of her concerts. They kiss and leave the stadium together while Swift, in a voiceover, reflects on their unlikely match-up: \"If you ever would've told me that the most meaningful relationship I would ever have would start with a man saying that he was 'butthurt' that I didn't want to meet him — like, unbelievable. Unbelievable.\"",

    "fullText": "The Justice Department has officially released documents on Jeffrey Epstein, the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nFriday's disclosure is the first of what are expected to be several rounds of document releases over the coming weeks as the DOJ scrambles to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in November.\n\nThe documents contain a trove of photos, some of which feature famous names such as former President Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those connections and law enforcement's handling of the case.\n\nSo what else do the latest Epstein files contain? Business Insider reporters have begun looking through the documents and photos and we'll be reporting out highlights as they're discovered.\n\nA bipartisan duo of House lawmakers responsible for pushing the Epstein files bill through Congress is displeased with the Justice Department's release of documents thus far and publicly proposing remedies.\n\n\"Unfortunately, today's document release by @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlanche grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago,\" Rep.

Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said it was unacceptable that many documents remain redacted, despite the law allowing only narrow exceptions and requiring explanations for such redactions. He threatened the possibility of impeachment if Justice Department officials do not comply, though such action would require at least some Republican support.\n\n\"Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options,\" Khanna said in a video posted on X. \"It can be the impeachment of people at Justice, inherent contempt, or referring for prosecution those who are obstructing justice.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Epstein's longtime friend and sex trafficking accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, features heavily in the files dropped on Friday. The files include photos of them traveling together and her dressed up in a uniform.\n\nThe daughter of a British media Tycoon, Maxwell was a constant presence in Epstein's life over the decades. The two were even romantically involved at one point.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year sentence at a minimum-security federal prison in Texas for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking operation.Read full story\n\nSome redactions to the files are drawing ire online.\n\n\"Breaking News: The Epstein Files,\" wrote Julie K.

Spacey himself has faced sexual misconduct allegations, but has been cleared of charges in jury trials in New York and London.\n\nRepresentatives for Spacey and Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe DOJ has been investigating Epstein for the better part of two decades, starting around 2006 after local police in Palm Beach, Florida, began looking into complaints that he was luring young girls to his mansion by promising them money for massages.\n\nIt's no wonder then that the agency has so much data that Friday's drop — despite being a partial release —was broken into four parts.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross are among the wealthy and powerful individuals included in the thousands of images released by the Justice Department.\n\nBeing featured in the photographs released, or having a tie to Epstein, is not an indication of wrongdoing, and it's unclear what the context of some of the photos might be.

One collection of photos included a series of nude photographs, redacted so as not to be explicit.\n\nOther images appear to be from Epstein's Manhattan home, including photos of his bedroom, risque wall art, what appeared to be an effigy hanging from the staircase, and a taxidermied tiger.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is the most transparent in history. By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have. And while President Trump is delivering on his promises, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender. The American people deserve answers.\" Abigail Jackson WH spokeswoman\n\nThe DOJ added several warning notices about its Epstein documents.

We've seen titans of industry like Richard Branson, Bill Gates, and Sergey Brin.\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\n\"The Trump administration can't move the goalposts. They're cemented in law,\" Schiff added.\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law on November 19, states that the documents can be released no \"later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\" According to the law, the attorney general needs to \"make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nIn 2019, ahead of Epstein's arrest and suicide, Steve Bannon filmed what he said were 15 hours of interviews with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThat footage has remained under wraps. If the footage was on Epstein's hard drives, however, the DOJ might have obtained it when the FBI seized his electronic devices around the time of his arrest on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nRecently released text messages between Epstein and Bannon have shed some light on the project, which was intended to be a promotional documentary to burnish Epstein's reputation.\n\nRead that story here:Read full story\n\nJustice Department officials told multiple news outlets earlier today that the files will be released at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThe DOJ has now missed that deadline. By law, it has until midnight tonight to release all of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nJustice Department officials told multiple news outlets earlier today that the files will be released at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThe DOJ has now missed that deadline. By law, it has until midnight tonight to release all of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhile the specifics of what will be in the files released on Friday aren't clear, here is some of what is anticipated:\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe White House initially opposed the transparency law until enough Republican lawmakers broke with GOP leadership to join House Democrats, forcing a vote on the bill. After it became clear Congress would move ahead anyway, Trump flipped his stance on the legislation.\n\nDuring Epstein's 2019 arrest, the FBI searched his Manhattan townhouse and his home in the US Virgin Islands. In the process, they obtained more than 70 computers, iPads, and hard drives, along with financial documents and binders full of CDs.\n\nThose seized materials form the heart of the \"Epstein files,\" which could shed even more light on the deepest, darkest secrets of the notorious pedophile.\n\nThose could include more emails and text messages, as well as internal prosecutorial records. The Justice Department has overseen two different criminal investigations into Epstein's sexual abuse of teenage girls. The first took place in Florida and led to a widely criticized plea deal in 2008. The second was the Manhattan-based investigation, which led to Epstein's 2019 arrest and Maxwell's prosecution.\n\n\"We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law,\" Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Robert Garcia of California said in a joint statement. \"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ.\"\n\nRaskin and Garcia serve as the top Democrats on the powerful House Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee, respectively. Since Democrats control neither chamber of Congress, their power to force the immediate disclosure of the documents is more limited.\n\nEarlier today, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department would not meet the legal deadline imposed by bipartisan legislation that President Donald Trump signed into law in November that requires the DOJ to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" regarding Epstein and his conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,\" Blanche said during an interview on Fox News.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein's co-conspirator, was found guilty of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Civil lawsuits involving Epstein, Maxwell, banks affiliated with Epstein, and the US Virgin Islands government have shaken loose even more details about his life. Various drips and drabs have also entered the public domain through Freedom of Information Act requests, government reports, and an inquiry from the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nAll of that may pale in comparison to what the Justice Department has in its possession.\n\nYes. In recent months, the House Oversight Committee has made public Epstein-related documents it obtained through subpoenas, including emails provided by his estate and never-before-seen photos of some of Epstein's powerful acquaintances, including Trump, Bill Gates, Larry Summers, and Steve Bannon.\n\nThose disclosures have already led to some fallout. Summers, a former Treasury Secretary, has been barred from the American Economic Association for life and is no longer teaching classes at Harvard University, pending an investigation.\n\nEpstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. He was known for rubbing elbows with powerful people — even after he was convicted of soliciting sex from a minor in 2008. Over the years, he has counted Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and other titans of finance, law, politics, and science among his acquaintances.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those relationships and law enforcement's handling of the case.",

    "fullText": "UTICA, N.Y. (AP) — A former New York state prison guard convicted of murder for his role in the brutal beating of an inmate that was captured on body-camera footage was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in prison.\n\nDavid Kingsley also received a 25-year sentence for a manslaughter conviction in the case. He is the only former guard convicted of murder in the death of Robert Brooks, who was pummeled by corrections officers on the night of Dec. 9, 2024, at Marcy Correctional Facility. Five other guards charged in the 43-year-old Black man’s death have pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n\nVideo footage of Brooks in handcuffs being punched and stomped by guards triggered widespread shock and calls for reform in New York's prisons. Kingsley was sentenced hours before Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a deal with state lawmakers on prison reforms that include a requirement that cameras be installed in all facilities and that video footage related to deaths behind bars be promptly released to state investigators.\n\nSix guards were indicted by a grand jury for murder charges brought earlier this year by the special prosecutor, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, who also charged four others with lesser crimes. Three of the defendants charged with murder later pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter.\n\nProsecutors said Kingsley deserved the maximum sentence because he refused to take responsibility for his actions and made Brooks' family go through the trauma of a trial. Speaking in court before the sentence was imposed, Kingsley apologized to Brooks' relatives for his role in the “senseless” actions that led to his death.\n\nThe victim’s son, Robert Brooks Jr., said that he hopes the case will prevent similar incidents in the future. Brooks’ brother, Jared Ricks, added that while forgiveness is a long way off, justice being served is a step on that path.\n\nKingsley, 45, was one of three guards tried before a jury in October on charges of murder and first-degree manslaughter. He was the only one of the trio found guilty. Body-camera footage played at the trial showed him holding Brooks by the neck and lifting him as multiple guards surrounded the handcuffed man.\n\nA final defendant is scheduled to stand trial Jan. 12 on a second-degree manslaughter charge. Another guard was released from prison this month as he attempts to withdraw his guilty plea to second-degree manslaughter.\n\nFitzpatrick became the special prosecutor after state Attorney General Letitia James recused herself, citing her office’s representation of several officers in separate lawsuits. He also is prosecuting guards in the fatal beating of Messiah Nantwi on March 1 at a nearby prison, the Mid-State Correctional Facility. Ten guards were indicted in April, including two who are charged with murder, in Nantwi’s death.\n\nThe prisons are about 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of New York City.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is entitled to his $55.8 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, Delaware's Supreme Court ruled.\n\nA Delaware Chancery Court judge struck down the compensation package last year after a Tesla shareholder sued over the massive payday, which was tied to a series of growth goalposts for the EV company.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court's ruling overturns that decision, saying it was too extreme a remedy.\n\nTesla shareholders recently approved an even bigger pay package of up to $1 trillion for Musk if Tesla achieves further sales and growth goals.\n\nThe decision to withhold his 2018 pay package prompted Musk to criticize Delaware on several occasions. Delaware's long-standing reputation for being business-friendly is rooted in the Delaware General Corporation Law, which serves as the foundation of its corporate law.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Musk wrote on X in August 2024.\n\nAt the time, two of Musk's companies — Tesla and SpaceX — were incorporated in Delaware. He moved those companies to Texas in 2024.\n\nDespite Delaware's position as a central incorporation hub, a series of court rulings left some prominent companies wondering if they could find stronger legal protections somewhere else, including VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe firm announced in July that its primary business, AH Capital Management, would no longer be incorporated in Delaware because \"legal uncertainty\" had worried investors and entrepreneurs on its board.\n\n\"As a result, many of the companies we fund and the entrepreneurs that we talk to are taking a second look at whether they should incorporate in other jurisdictions, prompted by the departure from Delaware of significant technology companies like Dropbox, Tripadvisor, and Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog post.\n\nThe firm said it's reincorporating in Nevada, an increasingly popular alternative.\n\nBusinesses incorporated in Delaware account for a large chunk of the state's revenue. As of 2024, more than 2.1 million businesses were incorporated in Delaware, meaning a widespread exodus could do serious damage to its economy.\n\nEven so, Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider that officials aren't spooked by the \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business,\" she said.\n\nPatibanda-Sanchez added: \"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way. We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "fullText": "on December 19, 2025 at 11:47AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThis may seem unimaginable for gamers of a certain age, but once upon a time, the best and most reliable way to try out a game before it launched was by going directly to an Electronics Boutique, a KB Toys, or any major department store with an electronics department, and playing it on a kiosk. And as a gamer of that certain age, this was exactly how I played Super Nintendo and Game Boy games for years, long before my mother could afford to buy us either (during the console wars, we were staunchly in the Sega camp). It was perfect. We would go to Sears, mom would go buy her clothes and various things for the house, and I and/or my best friend would hang out and play Mario Land, Mario World, or Donkey Kong Country for an hour at a mostly empty kiosk.\n\nAnd then there was the weekend that there was a crowd. The Nintendo kiosk was gone, and in its place was something gray and alien. And there were dozens huddled around it. We got closer, and we found out why: It was a kiosk for something called a PlayStation, and the screen showed a fighting game made up of polygons moving in and around the background in 3D. And a crowd of people were beholding their first glimpse of the future.\n\nOn September 9, 1995, the original PlayStation was released in North America, and a new era of gaming had finally begun. But for many folks at the time, that new era had a herald. The hardcore folks who preordered the PS1 got the fancier disc with the T-Rex tech demo, but much of the general public got their first taste of the PS1 with the PlayStation Picks disc, which came bundled with the console at launch and was playing non-stop on kiosks across America. These were the games and demo videos meant to sell the PS1 to the unconverted, the ambassadors Sony would send to show the world pixels were on notice, polygons were the way forward.\n\nWhat's fascinating now, though, is looking at that roster of games and comparing it to the games people call out in 2025 as the games that defined the era, at least in the way early-adopter killer-app titles like the original Super Mario Bros did for the NES, Altered Beast and Revenge of Shinobi did for the Genesis, or Mario World and F-Zero did for the SNES. While the PlayStation all-stars (no, not those ones) on that disc are easy to account for (Twisted Metal, Tekken, Wipeout, Air Combat), there are 12 games represented on that disc--eight preview videos, and four playable demos--and not all of them are as widely remembered as, say, Tekken or Ridge Racer. So, what exactly happened to the PlayStation class of 1995? Some went on to be all-time classics, while others, not so much. Let's go through them, one by one, and find out.\n\nESPN Extreme walked--er, well, biked and luged, really--so that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater could run. Right as \"extreme sports\" was becoming a thing culturally, PlayStation were right there at the forefront with the first game making a solemn attempt to tap in. ESPN Extreme itself owes a lot to EA's Road Rash far as mechanics go--racing but being able to whack people off their vehicles. But where Road Rash was still beholden to leathery biker aesthetics (though the 3DO/Sega CD ports did inject grunge back into the mix), throwing roller blading, mountain biking, and street luges in with a punkier soundtrack got it closer to the zeitgeist. That official ESPN X-Games license only helped in that regard.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: After the ESPN license dropped, Sony churned out two more sequels under the names 2Xtreme and 3Xtreme (with the original even getting re-released as 1Xtreme) with more tracks, stages, and official partnership with real-life athletes. Once that third game hit, though, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater basically carried the extreme sports standard forward, and that was that.\n\nAs for the devs, Sony Interactive Studios was, essentially, one of Sony's A-teams in the early days of the PlayStation, either directly developing or helping produce some of the biggest hits of the early days. They'd eventually splinter off and operate as 989 Studios for a while, and while most of their output wound up being Sony's first-party sports titles, their name is on some serious heavy hitters. A couple of those will be showing up later in this list, but a few others include the first two Syphon Filters, JetMoto, and even the first Everquest. They also made Spawn: The Eternal. (We forgive them.) The studio was eventually folded back into being Sony Interactive again in 2005.\n\nJumping Flash is one of the true unsung heroes of the 32-bit era. Folks love to argue about which of the big groundbreaking 3D platformers was best between Nights: Into Dreams, Crash Bandicoot, and Mario 64, but Jumping Flash was first, and while graphically threadbare, it's still best in a few areas. There's nothing terribly special about the plot: An evil real estate mogul named Baron Aloha who looks like a Funko Pop of Ted Turner steals chunks from a planet to develop as exclusive property for himself, and a space council sends a giant, adorable robot rabbit named Robbit to save the world. The core gameplay is little more than a simple collect-a-thon, and yet, that collection is dependent on Robbit making death-defying jumps across wide-open stages, all while using FPS mechanics to take down anything in his way with lasers and fireworks.\n\nMechanically, it plays less like a Mario 64, and more like Baby's First Metroid Prime. Aside from the lack of dual analog stick controls (it was 1995, after all), it's doing so many things other developers wouldn't figure out about running and jumping in 3D for years. The cherry on top is one of the finest soundtracks the PS1 had to offer, which is saying a lot. Spoiler alert, but arguably, this is the title that's held up the best from the PS1's entire launch library, and yet, it's right down there with Philosoma and Kileak as the titles we talk about the least.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Jumping Flash was at least successful enough to warrant a couple of sequels: the equally-as-good Jumping Flash 2 and Robbit Mon Dieu, which never even got a Western release.. According to former Sony Interactive president Shuhei Yoshida, the team behind PS2 launch title Fantavision once tried to grab the license for some sort of PSVR remake of the game, but the project simply fell through. The series has been dead in the water ever since. Though, shout outs to Team Asobi for giving poor, neglected Robbit some love with prominent cameos in Astro's Playroom and 2024's Astro Bot, even putting some extra respect on his name by labeling his VIP Bot in the latter \"A true 3D platforming pioneer.\"\n\nEven though Virtua Fighter had existed for about a year prior to the PlayStation, that series, to this day, has just never caught on in the West the way it's damn near an institution in Japan, at a time when the much flashier Street Fighters and Mortal Kombats ruled arcades. As such, Toshinden very quickly became the de facto ambassador for 3D fighters for quite a lot of folks, and as a first look at 3D graphics in early 1995, it was, for a time, breathtaking. Sure, it almost immediately began to age like a fine milk the second people got their hands on Tekken, but hey, it was also a snazzy, fluid (for the time), stylish 3D weapon-based fighting game with an eclectic roster, at a time when there wouldn't be any legitimate competition in that sphere until Bushido Blade and Soul Edge two years later.\n\nFor a hot second, it even felt like whip-wielding Russian dominatrix Sophia might actually be the game's breakout star. Oh, but nooo, that scene-stealing tramp Lara Croft had to come along a year later and blow up her spot. In 2025, it's a sluggish mess to play, though, still gotta hand it to ‘em that final boss Sho's stage--taking place in front of an ominous Tower of Babel while Bach's Toccata and Fugue plays during a wind storm--is a pure aura farm if ever there was.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Oh, Takara/Tamsoft tried so very hard to milk Toshinden for all it was worth before its 15 minutes were up. The original game got a Remix version on Saturn, and a shockingly great Game Boy port. There were three progressively worse sequels. There was even an anime OVA directed by Masami Obari of Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture fame. But as mentioned, Tekken, Soul Blade, even Virtua Fighter all had juice that Toshinden just didn't, and after those four sequels failed to win any additional hearts and minds, the series has been effectively dead since 1999, and nobody's really clamoring for a comeback.\n\nThe original Wipeout gets a lot right, really. There were lightning fast futuristic racing games before this, but by and large, the future they envisioned looks more like The Jetsons. Wipeout, on the other hand, looked and sounded like the inside of a London rave, 200 years from now, and that phenomenal art direction gave it an older, edgier fanbase than just about anything else on the system at launch. The vibes were absolutely immaculate. The actual game, on the other hand…well, it was fast, certainly, but it was just far too easy in that original game to scrape a wall and have all your momentum grind to a halt, in a way that made it way more unsatisfying than it should've been. These are problems that would be eradicated a year later, when Psygnosis dropped the utterly flawless Wipeout XL, a game so influential it basically kicked the door down for hardcore EDM to become a mainstream genre in the late 90s.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Like EDM itself, Wipeout was never a blockbuster franchise, but the fans who stuck with it remained loyal as hell over the subsequent 30 years. There would be a new title on every PlayStation platform (as well as a just-okay N64 version nobody talks about), each one pushing the envelope of speed to the maximum limit of the hardware. And it would remain like this until Psygnosis--then having changed names to Studio Liverpool--was restructured in 2010, then fully shut down in 2012. The series would, at least, get something of an Irish funeral in 2017 with much of the original team contributing to Wipeout Omega Collection, which remastered tracks from Wipeout HD, Fury, and 2048 into 4K/60fps. But the real kicker was a patch in 2018 which added PSVR support. The game went from being a nice, polished package for the PS4, to one of the most breathtaking, adrenaline-spiking experiences you can have in any VR headset.\n\n….so naturally, the PSVR2 is incompatible with original PSVR titles, and they still haven't given Wipeout a new port, and just what are we even doing with that headset, Sony.\n\nOut of the launch lineup, Destruction Derby is the title that feels the most redundant. Not that it's a bad game, per se. For the time, it was actually one of the more technically impressive titles in the lineup, with the car destruction physics being surprisingly detailed in particular, as well as the fact that you could have almost two dozen cars on the road at one time. Thing is, if you wanted to drive around blowing up cars, Twisted Metal came out a week before this did. If you wanted a straight driving experience, Ridge Racer launched with the console. If you just plain wanted an alternative racing game, Wipeout and ESPN Extreme were there. That didn't stop the game from being a success, but it definitely limited how much of a tail the thing would have after launch.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: The immediate sequel, Destruction Derby 2, was a pretty big improvement, leaning harder into the more southern fried, thrashy chaos vibes demolition derbies have in the U.S. The N64 version was even better still, taking some of the sluggish racing sim controls out of the equation. Real talk, I didn't even realize there was a fourth game on PS1, Destruction Derby Raw, until writing this article. That apparently released in 2000, a month before the PS2 came out, and a general look at the critical reception shows that nobody missed a whole lot. The last game in the series, Destruction Derby Arenas, would release on PS2 in 2004, only notable for being one of the few, proud PS2 games you could play online, but it was completely immemorable otherwise, and Burnout 3: Takedown would eat its lunch in every single aspect later that year.\n\nIn the same way that Tekken would be the PlayStation's answer to Sega's Virtua Fighter, Ridge Racer was their answer to Virtua Racing and Daytona USA. Ridge Racer was faster, cooler, and just saying, one of these games let you play Galaga while the game loaded. Daytona may have had the banger theme song, but the counterpoint is the little secret that because Ridge Racer loaded the entire game while you actually played Galaga, once the game loaded, you could take the disc out, and put in any CD you wanted. If you weren't zooming around tracks to the Mortal Kombat soundtrack in ‘95, you missed a golden opportunity. The point being, while Ridge Racer was a bit basic, the little things added up, and if you just wanted a straightforward racer for PS1, this was an easy, no-brainer purchase.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: You'd think, looking at the series timeline, that Namco had basically put out a new Ridge Racer every six months until about 2012, but in reality, a lot of what passes for new releases in Ridge Racer are the types of updates that would basically be free downloadable content nowadays. The major releases that mattered would be the excellent Ridge Racer Type 4, Ridge Racer V (a PS2 launch title), Ridge Racer on PSP, and Ridge Racer 6 (a 360 launch title). Those are the ones actually pushing the series forward, adding new features, and changing the mechanical focus (from arcade driving to drifting, mostly).\n\nThe others are generally various forms of remixes and riffs on those four. As mentioned, Bandai Namco has largely pumped the brakes on the series since around 2012, with the last release being a mobile title called Draw & Drift in 2016. Still, as long as there's still somebody out there simping over Reiko Nagase, the series will never truly die.\n\nWell we can keep this one brief. If all of these games represent a high school graduating class, Tekken is the class president who went on to become a Hollywood director. No other game on the disk has maintained the staying power or popularity Tekken has. If anything, it's just astonishing just how fast we went from the relatively timid Battle Arena Toshinden to the hard-hitting Tekken within two months, and the two-hit combo of Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 3 would take the whole 3D fighter genre into lightspeed not even a year later. Namco evolved this formula so fast in such a short period, and while the moves would get flashier, and Kazuya Mishima would get tossed into bigger and bigger volcanoes, the foundation of everything Tekken would become was already there in 1995.\n\nWhere Are They Now?:As of the time of writing, the Tekken series as a whole has sold over 60 million copies, 2024's Tekken 8 has sold about 4 million copies, and it's Bandai Namco's best selling franchise by a wide margin (though the fact that Elden Ring is #2 at 40 million copies sold between only two games in the series is bananas).\n\nSo, yeah, they're doing fair-to-middlin'.\n\nIf Tekken was the class president of that first demo disc class, Air Combat gets the \"Most Likely To Succeed\" trophy. The first title in the series isn't even a particularly great game--great soundtrack aside, it's sparse and bland much of the time, at a time when your average arcade had the likes of G-LOC and After Burner. But the foundation of a great game is in there, and Namco would just keep building on that foundation slowly but steadily over the years, delivering consistently on a premise that, weirdly, you don't really see much of outside this series. But they had to start somewhere, and the original Air Combat is more of an academic curiosity nowadays than a graphical showcase.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Bandai Namco has basically dropped a new Ace Combat every 2-3 years since 1995, and aside from the free-to-play experiment we don't talk about anymore, you can pick up any of them past the first, and be in for a solid time flying the unfriendly skies. The eighth installment was formally announced at the 2025 Game Awards, and it was genuinely one of the highlights of the night.\n\nFor some reason, Sony decided that they needed two vehicular combat games during their launch window, and for some reason didn't immediately decide to just run with the one with the evil ice cream truck in it. To be fair, the first Twisted Metal doesn't go nearly as buck wild with its roster and features as the subsequent games would outside of old Sweet Tooth, but the game's edgelord attitude still made it stand out, and the addition of guns and bombs to the mix makes it a little more freewheeling than Destruction Derby was. It's not the best the series would have to offer, but there's plenty of what the series would become right there from the start.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: As a game series, Twisted Metal has had kind of a rough time of it. Twisted Metal 2 is a stone-cold classic, while the series just kinda spins its wheels for 3 and 4. Twisted Metal: Black was a grim(m) and gritty triumph that got the series back on track, only for Sony to put the series on ice for another four years. Twisted Metal: Head-On on PSP is mediocre on its own, though it did get a director's cut of sorts on PS2 that offered way more bang for the buck. The franchise goes back to sleep again until 2012, and a pretty great PS3 reboot.\n\nIt's now been 13 years, and if one were to hazard a guess what the hold up is, the, uh… well,let's usethe word\"colorful\"... reputation of series creator David Jaffe in the industry probably has something to do with why Sony hasn't decided to give the property another shot as a game. Instead, all the focus is now on the small screen, with Twisted Metal getting a live-action TV show adaptation on Peacock, and stunning everybody by actually being really, really fun, enough to get renewed for a third season, in fact.\n\nWhat's really striking as this list goes is just how many studios pulled double duty with the PS1's launch, putting two games out, and trying to suss out what actually sticks. The other thing is how many of these games end up cannibalized by the others in the same genre. In this case, despite being a better, more dynamic aerial combat title than Air Combat, and the tongue-in-cheek tone granting it a grim charm, Warhawk is kind of a distant memory. While yes, we can maybe blame Twisted Metal for pulling SingleTrac's focus away from The Little VTOL That Could, there were enough hard hitting, pulse pounding dog fights going on here to warrant more than being largely forsaken mere months after launch.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: The game wasn't completely forgotten, in fairness. Sony did put out a pretty decent and successful multiplayer-only reboot in 2007, which holds the distinction of being the first physical game to ever get a digital release on the PlayStation Network. That, in turn, got a sci-fi spinoff called Starhawk which was also rock solid, though after so many complaints about Warhawk ‘07 being multiplayer-only, Starhawk got a single-player campaign that feels like a monkey's paw curling on those complaints.\n\nEven compared to Jumping Flash, Philosoma is the genuine buried treasure of that first demo disc. At the time of its release, it was torn apart by critics for not being next-gen enough. It's not hard to see why, really. Philosoma is, essentially, a Whitman's Sampler of every single type of scrolling space shooter ever made up to that point. One stage will scroll left to right. The next will shift to a behind-the-ship POV. The next may take an isometric Zaxxon angle. While they're all well done, and the array of weapon variants is a highlight, in 1995, scrolling shooters were the epitome of a played-out genre. It'd be the equivalent of putting out a new hero shooter now. In 2025, a cool, straightforward space shooter would be a pretty welcome sight by itself. But it wouldn't be the decent gameplay that would make Philosoma stand out.\n\nSee, the story is that you play a pilot sent down to a colonized planet with a squadron led by a tactical AI, after the colonists put out a distress call. The planet seems deserted, but there's a whole lot of insectoid creatures running around, many of which seem to have infected the colonists' technology. As your crew starts scouring the planet for the colonists, one by one, the team's AI starts pulling a HAL 9000 on your teammates, while still leading you deeper into the planet's core. Eventually you find the colonists: liquified and strung up from the ceiling in a massive insect's hive like something out of a Junji Ito book. And you find out that not only is the planet alive, but your ship has been commandeered to fertilize the planet so the alien life form at the core can be born. It is DEEPLY horrifying, but easily one of the most memorable space shooters of the generation because of it. At least, for the maybe dozens of folks who actually played it.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: So, weird enough, Philosoma does technically have a sequel: a survival horror/visual novel game on PS2 called Phase Paradox that never saw Western shores. Funny enough, despite never making it out of Japan, it's fully voiced in English. It's not great, but it does in fact pick up where Philosoma left off, and it's honestly rather ambitious for the time, kind of a proto-David Cage game mixed with Parasite Eve.\n\nAs for the developers, they'd go on to do far less horrifying projects after. Two years later, G-Artists would be responsible for the extremely fun Intelligent Qube. Ten years later, the game's composer, Kow Otani, would go on to score Shadow of the Colossus. One of the folks who worked on visual effects for Phase Paradox is some dude named Yoko Taro. Wonder if he ever went on to do anything. Anyway, safe to say, a third go-around for this universe isn't in the cards. But what a ride.\n\nLast and most definitely least. FPS titles were still a pretty new genre in ‘95, especially on consoles, which makes it miraculous Jumping Flash got so much right. But even with that grace afforded, Kileak being miles and miles of copy/pasted hallways with the occasional robot to break things up is just the absolute worst, and the reward being a dozen or so audio logs from a mad scientist who thinks he found \"the real Adam\" isn't nearly enough to keep going. If you hated Ridley Scott's Prometheus, now imagine it was rendered on a PS1, but also they couldn't afford Michael Fassbender, so they hired a malfunctioning Disneyland robot from the Hall of Presidents. That's the level of production value you're working with here. Unsurprisingly, the video that comes on the demo disc shows none of that, just the cool CG cutscenes of mechs arriving at the South Pole to take down a mad scientist, with a techno song bumping over it.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Somehow, Kileak also got a sequel, called Epidemic (it goes by the far more ostentatious Kileak: The Blood 2: Reason in Madness in Japan) a year later. The big improvement is that now the hallways have texture. The emptiness problem is still very much in place, the acting is still abysmal, the shooting is still uninspiring. By the time it released, Doom, Hexen, and Alien Trilogy would all be on PS1. There is no excuse for an empty FPS map at this point. The developers, Genki, would go on to have a very long career pumping out consistent 6/10 games, but the only familiar names on their resume for Westerners would be the Tokyo Xtreme Racer games on Dreamcast/PS2, and, oddly enough, Katamari Forever on PS3, which was largely made of remixed stages from the previous games. Still, it netted them the best review scores of their career with near-universal 7s. Yay progress?",

    "fullText": "Ukraine’s dramatic escalation of its sea-drone attacks on tankers carrying Russian oil could spread to the English Channel, experts have warned.\n\nThe hit on an Oman-flagged tanker on Friday widened the Ukrainian operation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, signalling that sanctioned tankers could be hit anywhere on their journey.\n\n“The Ukrainians are now operating across a much wider area. If you’re a shadow fleet vessel then there’s now a risk wherever you are,” said Matthew Wright, of trade intelligence firm Kpler.\n\n“You get shadow fleet vessels that come out of the Baltic Sea, they are essentially going through the North Sea. The threat to them is now higher.”\n\nMichelle Bockmann, from maritime data company Windward, said the Ukrainians were likely to continue focusing on empty tankers rather than those laden with oil, but the attacks could impose massive costs on the vessel operators.\n\nShe added: “Marine insurers have been saying for quite a while now that one of these vessels, if they have a casualty, especially if they go through the English Channel, that they’re a billion-dollar marine accident waiting to happen.\n\n“Ukraine is aware of this risk, and I think that’s why this is a new strategy, an evolving strategy, and definitely one to watch.”\n\nThere are close to 1,000 tankers involved in Russia’s shadow fleet – the vessels, often false-flagged and with obscure ownership, that ferry crude or refined Russian oil to customers primarily in India and China.\n\nAbout 600 carry exclusively Russian oil, which puts them within the Western sanctions net. Roughly another 350 carry Russian oil alongside other cargo.\n\nUkraine has carried out drone attacks on three shadow tankers in the Black Sea in the past month, and is also thought to have been behind an apparent limpet-mine explosion off the coast of Senegal.\n\nExperts said the broadening attacks could prompt some vessel owners to question whether the risk of working for Vladimir Putin was still worth the reward.\n\nThe attacks could drive up ship owners’ insurance premiums. The insurers are believed to be mostly Russian or Chinese, and Kpler said operators might start to worry about whether they would get a payout if attacked.\n\nKpler’s Mr Wright said: “The London insurance market is incredibly well capitalised. It can handle a lot of large claims because the risk is spread. Whereas we don’t have a lot of visibility of how well capitalised the insurers are who cover the Russian shadow fleet.\n\n“If you’re a shadow fleet owner, you’d be asking whether you might get paid out. It will make a lot of the owners who have been leading players in the shadow fleet think about whether the risk-reward is worth it.”\n\nThe vessel owners could react to the bigger risks by raising the prices they charge Russia, further squeezing the Kremlin’s war chest.\n\nUkrainian security sources told local media this calculus made these tankers fair game.\n\n“The aggressor state used this tanker to circumvent sanctions and earn money that was used for the war against Ukraine,” the sources were quoted as saying.\n\n“Therefore ... this is an absolutely legitimate target. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop, and will beat him anywhere in the world.”\n\nThe Ukrainian action underscores the extent to which civilian tankers have become involved in geopolitical conflict and tension this year, with the US also blockading oil-freight traffic around Venezuela.\n\nMs Bockmann said this blurring of the line between the commercial and military domains was making the industry “uneasy”.\n\nArsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the UN’s International Maritime Organisation, this week urged restraint.\n\n“As the situation continues to escalate in the Black Sea, I call on all parties to refrain from targeting innocent seafarers, port workers and merchant ships,” he said.\n\n“Shipping should not be used as collateral in geopolitical situations and there is an increased environmental risk developing.”\n\nThe Ukrainians appear to be targeting only empty tankers, to avoid triggering an environmental disaster.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Multiple shark sightings at a Hawaiian beach have closed the waters to residents and tourists in the area.\n\nAt Nanakuli Beach on O'ahu, visitors and residents lost access to the beach as local authorities took safety measures after multiple shark sightings. According to Hawaii News Now, the Honolulu Ocean Safety Department spotted a non-aggressive seven to eight-foot shark, and about five minutes later, they spotted a 10-foot tiger shark at the beach.\n\nCrews posted signs, patrolled by land and sea, and kept the public informed while assessing the situation.\n\nShark sightings along O'ahu's coast are common and tracked by the state with a public incident log for residents and tourists to check. Still, the string of recent sightings has heightened concerns, especially as the beach remains a popular spot for families, surfers, and swimmers.\n\nWhile shark encounters are statistically rare, shifts in human behavior and environmental conditions are making close interactions more likely. Rapid coastal development reduces habitat and disrupts feeding patterns, while resource shortages and warming waters can push marine animals closer to popular beaches.\n\nRecent beach closures for sharks in California saw sharks moving farther north to establish a nursery in Monterey Bay, where none had existed before. Juvenile white sharks usually grow in warmer southern waters, but as ocean temperatures rise, they travel to new territory, sometimes not returning to their normal spots for years.\n\nResearch has shown increases in human-wildlife conflict in areas experiencing habitat loss and higher temperatures, not just in the ocean, with potentially dangerous outcomes for both wildlife and humans. Protecting coastal ecosystems, like reefs and beaches, before they disappear, helps reduce these risky interactions while supporting biodiversity and the health of local communities.\n\nOfficials urge beachgoers to avoid murky waters, swim in groups, steer clear of dawn and dusk hours, and always check with a lifeguard before entering the ocean. If you see or encounter a shark, notify ocean safety authorities immediately or call 911.\n\nConservation efforts across Hawaiʻi and beyond are offering hope and potential solutions. Reef restoration projects, marine-protected areas, and local programs have shown success in strengthening ecosystems and wildlife behavior. Coral recovery initiatives and community shoreline conservation work from organizations like the Surfrider Foundation can also help recover these natural environments.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A Northern California man caught a plump canary rockfish he says weighed in at 10.25 pounds (4.65 kilograms), likely setting state and world records.\n\nMendocino County fisherman Brendan Walsh, 26, said he caught the fish Tuesday off the coast of Albion, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of San Francisco.\n\nWalsh was headed back with his father Will Walsh after catching a few yellowtail on a cold and rainy day when he decided to make one last stop at a deeper spot. That's where the younger Walsh landed the canary rockfish.\n\n“It was a fluke,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\nCanary rockfish can grow up to 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) in length and weigh 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Walsh says the ones he usually catches are small and scrawny, clocking in around 3 lbs. (1.4 kilograms).\n\nWalsh said the fish he caught this week was 2.25 feet (0.68 meters) long.\n\nHe submitted the catch to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which tracks angling and diving records. The current state record-holding fish weighed in at 9 lbs. and was caught last November, also in Mendocino County.\n\nThe department has a form and instructions for submitting a possible record catch, including the names and phone numbers of witnesses. Applicants are asked to contact the department for the nearest environmental scientist who can identify the catch.\n\nWalsh said they weighed the fish at an authorized fish market nearby and a state fish and wildlife scientist who works in the area came over to sign off on the paperwork.\n\nWalsh has also submitted his catch to the International Game Fish Association in Florida, where the world record holding 10-pound canary rockfish was caught in 1986. He says larger fish may have been caught but never submitted for record consideration.\n\nThe game fish association did not respond Friday to a request for comment.\n\nAfter spending Tuesday making sure they had taken the right measurements to document the catch, Walsh's mother, Deirdre Lamb, fried the rockfish with garlic and butter to eat on Wednesday.\n\nThe rockfish was delicious, he said.",

    "fullText": "on December 19, 2025 at 2:24PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nRogue has joined Marvel Rivals as part of Season 5.5, adding to the growing list of Vanguard heroes. She joins as a melee tank focused primarily on brawling and diving, while also being the first 5-Star difficulty tank according to NetEase's in-game difficulty rankings. Rogue comes ahead of Season 6, which will see the addition of Deadpool and Elsa Bloodstonein yet unannounced roles.\n\nRogue is a damage-heavy tank, focused on disrupting the enemy team through a number of dashes and dives. Her primary attack, Power Surge Punch, follows a three-hit combo dealing 35 damage on the first two hits and 45 on the third. She can use her defensive stance to temporarily reduce incoming damage while powering up her next punch. In that stance, she can also use one of her dashes, Southern Brawl, to close the distance and deal damage.\n\nHer Chrono Kick Combo knocks enemies up into the air, while Rogue temporarily flies. Using the ability again does a downward dive kick, dealing AoE damage and bringing Rogue back to the ground. Fatal Attraction has Rogue dash forward, before releasing a ring of damage around her that pulls enemies closer. Lastly, her ultimate ability Heartbreaker depletes enemies' ultimate charge in a large AoE circle, while also absorbing key stats and dealing a small amount of damage.\n\nPower Surge Punch (primary): Punch forward with both fists.\n\nDefensive Stance: Absorb nearby projectiles and reduce incoming damage; absorbed damage powers up your next Southern Brawl.\n\nSouthern Brawl: While in Defensive Stance, dash forward and slam enemies in front, dealing area damage.\n\nChrono Kick Combo: Dash forward and launch the enemy, entering flight; activate again to Knock Down nearby enemies. Your next two Power Surge Punch attacks become ranged, piercing enemies and granting Bonus Health.\n\nFatal Attraction: Dash forward. Press again to unleash a burst of Chronovium Power, dealing continuous damage to nearby foes; after a delay, the energy retracts, pulling all enemies towards Rogue.\n\nAbility Absorption: Dash forward to knock down your target and absorb their energy; after absorbing, replace Ability Absorption with one of their abilities or refresh Fatal Attraction. Also absorb Health and stats based on their role.\n\nHeartbreaker (ultimate): Continuously absorb Ultimate Ability Energy from nearby enemies and steal stats based on their role.\n\nHearts as One (Gambit team-up): Gambit shares kinetic energy with Magneto and Rogue. When Magneto activates this ability, Iron Volley is replaced with Ace Greatsword, which detonates upon striking enemies. The explosion leaves residual kinetic energy within the target, inflicting secondary damage after a brief delay. When Rogue activates the ability, each of her attacks causes a kinetic explosion that damages nearby enemies and heals nearby allies.\n\nRogue straddles a thin line between being a brawler and a dive tank. She certainly has the strength to be a dive tank, but her low self-sustain makes surviving without support from a Strategist quite difficult. This is solved by her team-up with Gambit, providing some healing and extra damage, but you won't always have that.\n\nInstead, you need to balance out diving into combat and using one of Rogue's three movement abilities to get out of danger, too. With high cooldowns, this can be tough to manage, and it never feels good to use an ability to leave a fight instead of finishing an enemy off, but remember, as a tank, your role is to disrupt the enemy team. You can't do that effectively if you overextend, especially if it results in you getting killed. If you don't feel like the abilities you can absorb from your enemies are impactful, consider holding Ability Absorption for a Strategist or Vanguard to give yourself a quick health boost.\n\nRogue is at her best when you are constantly in the thick of battle with your team. While you might rack up some impressive damage numbers, your focus shouldn't be on finishing enemies off, but instead making it difficult for your opponents to effectively play the game. Rogue's Chrono Kick Combo is a great example, where you can knock opponents up and disrupt their movement a second time on the downward kick.\n\nHer Fatal Attraction ability pulls enemies close to you as well, making it easy to force enemies to spend energy on you, instead of taking out your Strategists or Duelists. If an enemy Daredevil or Black Panther wants to dive your supports, you can make their lives hell by disrupting their combos and game plan, purely by just getting in the way. Even if you can't take them out in the process, keeping your supports alive is worth the effort and an effective way to play Rogue.\n\nRogue's ultimate ability, Heartbreaker, leans into her lore to create a unique ability. She unleashes a large AoE circle around herself, that depletes enemies' ultimate charge. While it does a ton of other stuff, this primary power of depleting enemy ult charge makes it the kind of ultimate ability that you should be using as soon as it's up, regardless of the situation. Using it whenever you have it lowers the number of ultimates your opponents can use, which is a huge advantage in Marvel Rivals. You'll still need to pick your spots to ensure you get a couple of enemies in it, but holding it for the right moment is the wrong move.\n\nIn terms of actually using it, you also gain attack power from Duelists, self-healing from Strategists, and maximum health from Vanguards. Basically, if you can keep a couple of enemies in range, you'll deal a ton of damage and be tough to take down. Most people will scatter as soon as you activate it, so make sure all of your movement abilities are off cooldown, so you can keep them in range if they try to run from you.",

There are quite a few options out there, so to make it easier to find them all, we've compiled all the Stranger Things board games, card games, and puzzles into the gallery below. As you'd expect, some of these are proving to be quite popular ahead of Season Five's conclusion. We've seen several of the games and puzzles linked below go in and out of stock--so if one of your favorites is gone, be sure to check back for restocks. Stranger Things Season Five's second batch of episodes hit Netflix on December 25, followed by the series finale on December 31.\n\nUp to six players can enjoy this cooperative game, as they comb through dozens of documents and investigate the bizarre happenings around the town of Hawkins. You'll need internet access for some of its puzzles--allowing you to access various files and even an old Walkman--though even folks unfamiliar with the series can help unravel this strange mystery.\n\nYour standard deck of cards gets a Stranger Things makeover with this fun set. The officially licensed set also comes with a collectible store tin, giving you a cool place to stash your cards when they're not in use.\n\nAnother set of playing cards, this time with a higher quality finish and more premium materials. Featuring holographic red and silver foils, these high-end cards are a nice alternative to the gift set above.\n\nTop Trumps is a simple card game that has you battling to collect all the cards in the deck. This rendition gets you cards featuring iconic characters from the show, including Eleven, Hopper, Mike, and even the Mind Flayer.\n\nThink you're a Stranger Things expert? Test yourself with this quiz, featuring 500 questions and a nifty storage container.\n\nPick up some Top Trumps cards along with a unique collector's tin. The tin is the big selling point here--featuring a Hawkins High School design, it's a cool bit of memorabilia for your home theater.\n\nSave Hawkins from a series of supernatural threats in this cooperative board game. It features events from the first two seasons, comes with 11 miniatures (including the Demogorgon and Eleven), and each match runs for about an hour.\n\nThe Mind Flayer is taking over Hawkins, and it's unclear who is under its control. This bluffing game sees \"Sane\" characters battling against \"Possessed\" characters, but the other players don't know which team you belong to. That means you'll have to bluff your way to success, while trying to determine who you can trust along the way.\n\nPlay through the last campaign of Eddie Munson. You'll get to go on four adventures that have you fighting Demogorgons and Demodogs, and the set includes everything you need to get started--such as retro cards, character sheets, dice, and a DM's screen.\n\nPut together a stylized image of a Demogorgon tangled in festive holiday lights. The finished puzzle is 21.25 x 15 inches, and you'll get a full-color poster as a bonus.\n\nLooking for a big project to work on? Check out this colorful 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, which features Eleven as part of the Nina Project. The completed puzzle is 26.75 x 19.75 inches, and you'll get a reference poster to help you along the way.\n\nPut together an iconic scene of the Stranger Things kids as they bike through the eerie streets of Hawkins. It's a big undertaking at 1,000 pieces, though no doubt it's one of the coolest designs up for grabs. Includes a reference poster and the finished project clocks in at 26.75 x 19.75 inches.\n\nPut together a cool panorama of various Stranger Things scenes. The main cast is shown off across the seasons here, making it a fun way to commemorate the finale on New Year's Eve.\n\nFeaturing a unique black, white, and red design, this 1,000-piece puzzle looks much different than the ones above. It adapts the artwork from the premium playing cards into a puzzle, though it keeps some of the holographic elements for a truly eye-catching design.\n\nWe're not sure if it'll allow you to communicate with the Upside Down, but you can definitely use it to build some cool, colorful designs. This version includes templates inspired by the show, such as the Hellfire Club Demon, Demodog, and Eddie's Guitar.",

But she said, “It is not an effective use of our time” to stay in the race, and that she instead wants to spend more time with her young son and family.\n\n“I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness — particularly at his tender age,” she said.\n\nStefanik was set to have a tough race against Blakeman, with both politicians counting themselves as allies of Trump and attempting to court his support. Though, the president had seemed keen on avoiding picking a side in the race, telling reporters recently: “He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people.”\n\nOn Friday, Trump, writing on his Truth Social media platform, called Stefanik a “fantastic person and congresswoman.”\n\n“Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” Trump wrote.\n\nStefanik, who represents a conservative congressional district in northern New York, has been an intense critic of incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is also seeking reelection but faces a primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.\n\nFollowing Stefanik's exit, Hochul's campaign spokesperson said, “If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose.\"\n\nStefanik was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she won her first campaign in 2014 at just 30 years old, representing a new generation of Republicans making inroads in Washington. She ultimately rose to her party’s leadership in the House when she became the chair of the House Republican Conference in 2021.\n\nFirst viewed as a moderate when she came to Washington, Stefanik became far more conservative as Trump began to dominate the party. Once someone who refused to say Trump’s name, she became one of his top defenders during his first impeachment inquiry. She would go on to vote against certifying the 2020 election results, even after a violent mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nLast year, Stefanik was tapped to become the president’s ambassador to the United Nations, though her nomination was later pulled over concerns about her party’s narrow margins in the House. She then began to angle toward a run for governor.\n\nStefanik’s decision follows a clash with Speaker Mike Johnson, whom she accused of lying before embarking on a series of media interviews criticizing him. In one with The Wall Street Journal, she called Johnson a “political novice” and said he wouldn’t be reelected speaker if the vote were held today.\n\nThe tumultuous early December episode appeared to cool when Johnson said he and Stefanik had a “great talk.”\n\n“I called her and I said, ‘Why wouldn’t you just come to me, you know?’” Johnson said. “So we had some intense fellowship about that.”\n\nStill, Stefanik, the chairwoman of the House Republican leadership, has not fully walked back her criticisms. A Dec. 2 social media post remains online in which, after a provision she championed was omitted from a defense authorization bill, Stefanik accused Johnson of falsely claiming he was unaware of it, calling it “more lies from the Speaker.”\n\nBlakeman, the executive of Nassau County on Long Island, released a statement Friday night that thanked Stefanik “for her outstanding service to the people of New York and to all Americans.”\n\n“I am ready to work hand-in-hand with the Congresswoman and all New Yorkers to restore accountability, affordability, and safety to state government,” he said.",

Cadwalader’s current co-managing partners will be relegated to the new firm’s management committee.\n\nPartners at both firms still need to vote to finalize the merger next year.\n\nThe deal is being described as the legal industry’s largest-ever merger, creating a $3.6 billion megafirm with more than 3,000 lawyers, according to the Journal.\n\nHogan Lovells is headquartered in London and Washington, D.C.\n\nCommenting on the merger, Zaldivar said Wall Street had long been the firm’s “missing piece,” telling the Journal, “We felt that we needed to consolidate our position with a strong finance practice in New York.”\n\n“It’s a deal that makes perfect sense,” he added.\n\nDespite being burned by its prior dealings with Trump, Cadwalader co-managing partner Pat Quinn reaffirmed the company’s commitment to pro bono legal work in a statement shared by Reuters.\n\nHowever, he declined to say whether the firm’s previous deal with the administration would apply to the merged firm.\n\nLast year, another famous Wall Street firm, Shearman & Sterling, merged with Allen & Overy to create a $3.4 billion business. Chicago-based firm Winston & Strawn also announced plans on Monday to merge with U.K. practice Taylor Wessing in 2026.",

The debate on this week’s “New Heights” podcast included some disparaging remarks by Jason about Kansas City’s Mexican cuisine and one KC taqueria doubling its social media following.\n\n“I am not going to Kansas City for tacos,” Jason said.\n\n“Because it’s the Midwest. I’ll go to L.A. for tacos, I’ll go to Miami for tacos,” Jason explained.\n\nKansas City Royals ‘fully committed’ to crossing state line: KS Senate President\n\nWhile the elder Kelce brother may not be a believer, the future Chiefs Hall of Fame tight end gave a shout out to one of his KC taco favorites on Wednesday’s New Heights podcast.\n\n“My phone was blowing up saying hey did you see the podcast,” Rudy’s Tenampa Taqueria owner Rudy Garcia Jr. said.\n\n“Rudy’s? I’m not going to a taco spot called Rudy’s,” Jason Kelce exclaimed.\n\nRudy’s have called Westport home for more than 30 years and now also have a Lenexa location.\n\n“Any skeptical people that come in all you got to do is take one bite and they are hooked,” Garcia said about the taqueria’s name which he shares with his father, Rudy’s founder.\n\nRudy Sr. said that’s what happened when Travis started stopping by a decade ago, almost always ordering the deep fried chicken tacos. Thursday New Heights followers followed suit.\n\n“I’m a big 92 percenter, love the podcast love Travis and Jason and what they are doing for the community,” first time customer Nate Hetmanek said.\n\nChiefs head trainer Rick Burkholder gives timeline Patrick Mahomes recovery, rehab\n\nAcross the state line Taco Trail promoters who’ve had almost 30,000 check ins the past five years welcome Jason’s opinions and the opportunity to change his mind.\n\n“You get a mix of tacos. There are places that have birria there are places that have carnitas like think of a type of taco you’d like to have and high possibility the taco trail has multiple options for that. Come experience the trail and give us a chance.” Ritz Dasgupta, Visit Kansas City Kansas’ marketing director, said.\n\n“It’s not supposed to be in a strip mall in Kansas City. I will try these tacos, I will beyond shocked if they can compete,” Jason told Travis while praising a L.A. taco truck.\n\n“If he comes in I’d be glad to have him come down here and have some really good Mexican food,” Rudy Garcia Sr. said.\n\nDasgupta added the Taco Trail offers private bus tours if Jason Kelce wants to make sure he’s making an educated opinion on the quality of Kansas City tacos.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — The young journalist in a red bow tie stood during President Vladimir Putin's annual news conference Friday and displayed a sign saying he wanted to get married. But his main question wasn't directed at Putin — it was to his girlfriend, Olga, proposing marriage.\n\nPutin complimented Kirill Bazhanov of Yekaterinburg’s Channel 4 on his snazzy tie, saying, \"You’re ready to go to the registry office!” Bazhanov told Putin “we’d be very glad to see you at the wedding.”\n\nThe Russian leader’s year-end media session had serious questions, of course, about late pension payments, construction projects gone wrong, and the fighting in Ukraine, where Putin sent troops nearly four years ago.\n\nBut every year — amid the weighty questions from the domestic and international media — there are also odd and lighter moments, like this year when people asked Putin what his license plate number was and whether love at first sight existed.\n\nIt’s all part of the spectacle of the tightly orchestrated event — an opportunity for Putin, who has ruled Russia for 25 years, to expound on a wide array of subjects as well as to burnish his image as a fatherly figure to address the concerns of ordinary Russians who submit questions in advance.\n\nBazhanov did actually have a question for Putin — about greater support for young families. Later in the 4 1/2-hour news conference, one of the anchors passed along the news that Bazhanov's girlfriend had said yes. Putin promptly quipped about collecting money for the wedding.\n\nFor those inside Moscow’s Gostinny Dvor amphitheater, the most important task was to get Putin's attention. Most brought signs and some wore national dress. One reporter brought a clutch of Labubu dolls personalized to look like Russian officials and one in the form of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nOne reporter asked whether a comet approaching Earth could be a UFO, and reassured Putin that the city of Tyumen would be ready to welcome any extraterrestrial guests.\n\nPutin seemed unfazed throughout, although Tajik journalist Shamsudin Boboyev caused a brief commotion when he tried to give Putin a book. Two security officials quickly stopped him from going onstage, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested Boboyev should simply describe the gift, which would be given to him later.\n\nToward the end of the session, a journalist who noted that Putin had said earlier he believed in love at first sight asked him if he was in love. The Russian leader, whose private life remains closely guarded, answered simply, “Yes.”\n\nDavies reported from Manchester, England.",

    "fullText": "A total of 2.75 inches of rain fell in the Eugene area Dec. 18, breaking the previous Dec. 18 record of 1.52 inches set in 2018.\n\nThat rain has translated into two river floods in Lane County: the Siuslaw River in Mapleton, which peaked at 21.6 feet of water at 4 a.m, and the Mohawk River near Springfield, which is projected to peak at 16.32 feet at 4 p.m. The Siuslaw is considered flooded when it reaches 18 feet and the Mohawk is considered flooded when it reaches 15 feet.\n\nMike McGillivray with Springfield Public Works said the flooding on the river hasn't translated into flooding in the city proper.

    "title": "Seven Smart Appliance 'Upgrades' That Aren't so Smart",
    "description": "These fancy features will supposedly make your life easier—but may actually do the opposite.",
    "fullText": "Whether you want them to or not, appliances are getting smarter. It’s increasingly challenging to find even basic models without some kind of “smart” feature or embedded artificial intelligence. If you don't believe me, just try to find a “dumb” television at your local Best Buy. You will be disappointed.\n\nWhile it's true that many of the “smart” features offered by these nifty new appliances are quite useful. The ability to pre-heat your oven or adjust your thermostat by pressing a button on your phone is great, and getting alerts when the fridge door is left open or when you forget to move your laundry from the washer to the dryer is undeniably a boon.\n\nBut sometimes, the convenience these features offer is an illusion, as many supposedly smart features in modern appliances aren’t very smart at all—and they can actively make your life harder instead of easier. If you’re shopping for a new appliance, considering avoiding these not-so-smart features.\n\nModern clothes dryers offer a lot of great capabilities. Some can even talk to your washer, pre-setting themselves for the laundry coming its way, and many can remind you to collect your laundry, sparing you wrinkled clothes, and to clean out the lint filter. But modern dryers often come with moisture sensors that shut off the dryer when it detects that your clothes are dry. In theory, sensor drying saves you money and time over a fixed time dry. But the sensors in these dryers are notorious for being inaccurate shutting the dryer down when your clothes are still a bit damp. And you still have to make a guess as to how much drying you need and set the sensor to the proper level. At best, this can mean running another drying cycle. At worst, your clothes will sit there getting mildewy until you remember to check the machine.\n\nNew dishwashers often come with efficient or “eco” modes that use less water and less energy to clean your dishes. That’s a great idea—in theory. But these modes achieve those efficiencies the only way they can: By running at lower temperatures and literally using less water in their cleaning cycles. This can often leave your dishes visibly dirty after running a load, forcing you to cancel out the benefit by running them a second time. Worse, these modes don’t get hot enough to kill dangerous bacteria like E. coli, so even if your dishes come out looking clean, they may not be sanitary.\n\nSmart fridges are often at the top of people’s complaints list for two main reasons: One, they are often abandoned by their manufacturers soon after they arrive on the market, with updates and support vanishing in as quickly as two years. That transforms your pricey smart fridge into a pricey dumb fridge. More frustratingly, smart fridges that supposedly use artificial intelligence to identify your groceries as you place them inside (in order to help you track your shopping needs and expiration dates) often get things wrong. For example, this woman complained that her smart fridge often mistook her husband’s head for an avocado, among other problems, which rendered the feature worse than useless.\n\nWhile the modern microwave remains the steadfastly boxy, unsexy beast it’s always been, there have been attempts to make it smarter—and sometimes these attempts backfire on you. Some microwaves offer “sensor cooking,” the ability to sense the weight and moisture level of the food in order to adjust cooking time and power levels to cook your food perfectly. Except when it senses incorrectly and leaves you with a half-cooked mess, or if you’re trying to cook something that simply doesn't work well with sensor cooking, like dry foods that don’t produce enough steam for the sensor to detect.\n\nA smart kitchen scale might seem like a nifty idea; you weigh your food and use an app to get nutritional information, like the amount of calories in what you’re about to eat. That’s fine, but it really just adds an unnecessary step to your cooking routine, because most “smart” scales are just regular, standard kitchen scales and an app that Googles on your behalf. You’ll get the same general experience—and likely better accuracy—by weighing something and using your phone to search for nutritional information yourself.\n\nSmart garage doors are a great example of a piece of technology that isn’t improved much by being smart. And the core technology that makes the garage door smart—a WiFi connection to a cloud server—can also make it worse than useless. Aside from the fact that any disruption in the door’s connection can cause it to remain locked in the open position, leaving your home vulnerable, there’s also the fact that the manufacturer can make changes any time they like that could potentially alter the way your door functions or brick it entirely.",

    "title": "How to Use 'Progressive Overload' to Get Stronger",
    "description": "You can't just stick with the same workout forever.",
    "fullText": "As you get stronger, you become able to lift heavier and heavier weights. That's the idea at the heart of an often-misunderstood fitness concept: progressive overload. Unfortuantely, there are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about this principle, so here's how to use it to plan your own workouts or judge whether a program you're following will keep you on track.\n\nProgressive overload is the increase, over time, in the amount of work or stress you ask your body to handle. The term is used two different ways: as a principle of how the human body works, and as a description of how a workout program changes over time. If you want to know how to \"do progressive overload,\" you're thinking of the second one—how to design a workout program.\n\nThe simplest way to implement this is to just do a little more each time you're in the gym. More weight, or more reps, or making the workout harder in some other way. You can still take some easier \"deload\" workouts (or weeks) from time to time, but over the long term you want to see a trend of the workouts getting harder. They won't necessarily feel harder, because you'll be getting stronger. It's more like the workouts are keeping up with you.\n\nIn other words, progressive overload is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. As you get stronger, your workouts need to get harder to keep up. But in a sense you are also becoming stronger because you're challenging yourself with harder workouts.\n\nIf you’re bummed out by the idea of working harder and harder forever, don’t panic. You’ll work harder in absolute terms—by lifting heavier weights, let’s say—but the challenge stays about the same in relative terms. Your workouts will fall into an effort level you might call “hard, but doable,” and you’ll notice progress because your numbers are going up. (A similar approach applies to endurance sports. As cyclist Greg Lemond reportedly said: “It never gets any easier, you just go faster.”)\n\nWhen I started lifting weights many years ago, 65 pounds was a decently challenging bench press for me. I remember being proud of myself for being able to squeeze out a rep or two at 85 pounds. Now, if I’m going to do a bench workout, I don’t even bother loading those amounts onto the bar. My warmup sets start at 95 pounds, and a heavy single might be around 135. That 135 feels just as hard as 85 used to, but it’s undeniably more weight.\n\nHow did I make that progress? Well, I kept lifting the weights that felt heavy for me. Over time, the same weights that used to be challenging started to feel easy, and I needed to add more and more weight to the bar to get something that actually felt heavy. (I have a guide here to figuring out whether you’re lifting “heavy.”)\n\nMost of the time, I either followed a program that told me how many pounds to lift, increasing that amount slowly over time, or one that told me what effort level to lift at (a concept called RPE), which allowed me to choose an appropriate weight each day. Following a program will usually net you better progress than just winging it, but as long as you’re using the overload principle and the progression principle, you will get stronger.\n\nHere are some examples of workout routines that use progressive overload:\n\nDouble progression. Let's say you're aiming for three sets of eight to 12 reps of dumbbell shoulder press. You choose a weight that you can handle for 3 sets of 8 reps. The next time you do shoulder press, try to add at least one rep. If you can't, that's fine—just do your three sets of eight. One day maybe you'll get 10 reps on the first set, then only eight on the next two. Another time maybe you get 12, 10, and eight. After a few weeks you manage three full sets of 12. That means it's time to increase the weight! The next time you do the exercise, you'll use a heavier set of dumbbells and start again at three sets of eight. It's called \"double\" progression because first you increase the reps, and then you increase the weight.\n\nLinear progression. This is a common progression for barbell exercises for beginners. You do the same number of reps every time (say, five sets of five reps) but add a small amount of weight every workout. Often the program will have instructions for what to do if you can't complete the five sets of five reps at the new weight. These workouts aren't usually realistic for experienced lifters, since you can't keep increasing the weight forever, but they're great for people who are learning an exercise for the first time or returning to the gym after a break.\n\nSet progression. This may be used along with double progression, or may be its own thing. You start with just a few sets of an exercise per workout, say two or three, and then add a set each week. Once you're doing, say, five sets, you'll start over with heavier weight. If you're using it with double progression, you'll increase sets, and then reps, and then weight.\n\nDensity progression. This is commonly used in timed sets, like Crossfit WODs (\"workout of the day\") or for accessory lifts. Set a timer for several minutes and do as many reps as possible in the given time, resting as needed. The next time you do the workout, try to do more reps in the same amount of time. Once you can do the lifts with little to no rest, you'll either add weight or find another way to make the exercises harder (for example, doing dips instead of pushups).\n\nAs you can see, weight isn't the only variable that progresses. You can increase reps, or sets, or increase the amount of work you do in a given time by decreasing rest. You can increase the difficulty by choosing a harder exercise (like progressing from dips to pushups). As long as things get harder over time, you're doing progressive overload.\n\nAdding weight is part of most progressive overload schemes, but you don’t have to add weight to the bar literally every time you lift. There’s a wide range of weights and rep ranges that can be effective for building strength and muscle. For example, if I did a bench workout today, I might do sets of 10 at 100 pounds, or sets of five at 120, or some heavy singles at 140, or any combination of these. If I’m really tired or stressed, I might decide to do the sets of 10 at just 90 pounds. If I’m feeling great, I might be able to do them at 105. This is what I mean by a wide range: All of these are hard enough work to spur my muscles to adapt and get stronger. (There are reasons you might choose one of these workouts over the others, but we don’t need to get into those details at the moment.)\n\nWhat wouldn’t be progressive overload? Well, if I did sets of 10 with just the bar, that wouldn’t help me get stronger. If I had a mini barbell set, and it maxed out at 85 pounds, my strength would stagnate once I got to the point where 85 pounds isn’t a challenging weight anymore.\n\nEven as your strength improves, you don’t have to do more every single workout, as long as you’re getting stronger in the long term, and your workouts are still in the range that is challenging to you.\n\nSo let’s say you’re doing bicep curls with a 10-pound dumbbell. You can do eight or 10 reps with it. Perfect. But the only way to add weight, at your gym, might be to pick up a 15-pound dumbbell. If that weight is too heavy for you, that’s okay. Keep working with the 10-pounder, and in time you’ll be ready for the 15.\n\nWhile you’re probably itching to lift heavier weights, weight on the bar is not the only way to progress. Sometimes you can’t add weight because of equipment issues, or just because your strength is improving slowly. (Even if your beginner gains were meteoric, everybody’s progress slows down at some point.)\n\nBut if you’re smart, you probably don’t want to only get better at one specific thing. A lot of beginners start off doing squat, bench, and deadlift in sets of five reps, and trying to add weight each workout. But you’ll be a more well-rounded lifter if you also know how to lift heavy singles and sets of 10 or 15. Depending on your goals you might consider front squats in addition to back squats, and reverse hypers or kettlebell swings in addition to deadlifts. There are ways to improve at all of these things, and it’s normal for a lifter to be simultaneously increasing their reps in accessory lifts, increasing their weight on the bar for heavy singles, and increasing the amount of time they spend on conditioning workouts.\n\nNot every workout or routine will have progressive overload built in. For example, if you have a favorite workout that you do every day, but you never make it any harder (say, it's always three sets of ten pushups), you won't make progress over time. That's OK if you enjoy the workout for another reason, like if you're just trying to get the mental health benefits of a little exercise boost in the morning. But if you want to get better at pushups, you need to find a way to do more of them over time, or make them harder in some way (like elevating your feet, or doing them with a backpack on).\n\nWorkouts with progressive overload tend to be personalized to you. If the workout tells you exactly what to do, down to the exact weight of dumbbell to pick up, it's not giving you room to choose the weight that matches your current strength level. The 12-3-30 treadmill workout, for example, is the same for everyone every time. If it's one-size-fits-all, there's no way to progress.\n\nThat said, some workouts have a sneaky progression built in. If you jog for 30 minutes each day, chances are you'll get a little faster over time even if you don't realize it, and then you're doing more work within the same amount of time. Or if you do \"three sets of 10\" of an exercise, but each day you pick up whatever dumbbells feel appropriate for that level, you'll probably end up using heavier ones over time. Just make sure you don't get stuck doing the exact same thing month in and month out.\n\nOne last thing, now that we’ve discussed what progressive overload looks like. It’s important to remember that progression happens in the long term. Some competitive lifters might not test their one-rep max outside of competition, which means they’ll only find out once or twice a year how much their deadlift has gone up. That doesn’t mean they haven’t progressed in the meantime. If they’re doing an effective program, consistently challenging themselves, they’re still working.\n\nPlateaus are a fact of life when you’re a lifter. Sometimes it takes a while to get stronger. Sometimes you need to work on your technique to be able to express your newfound strength. Sometimes factors like stress or weight loss or changes in your training can make you weaker in the short term, but if you keep training in a way that challenges you, you’ll set new PRs soon enough.",

    "fullText": "There are warning signs that your home network may have been compromised, such as unusual traffic patterns and slowdowns in system performance, but now there's a simple tool to help determine if your router or connected devices are being used to conduct malicious activity. IP Check, from threat monitoring firm GreyNoise, will alert you if your IP address has been observed scanning the internet as part of a botnet or residential proxy network.\n\nAs GreyNoise outlines, residential IP compromise often isn't obvious to the user because you're still able to conduct business as usual, such as streaming, emailing, and web browsing. All the while, though, threat actors are routing malicious activity through your home IP address and can potentially exploit your network for everything from account takeovers to malware distribution.\n\nTo use IP Check, you simply need to open the tool in a browser window, and you'll get one of several results. If your IP is clean, that means that your network hasn't been caught scanning the internet (nor does it belong to any known business service infrastructure).\n\nYour IP may also be flagged as being in the GreyNoise database, which is not a sign of compromise—this is likely because you're using a VPN, corporate network, or cloud provider, and the tool can distinguish between an IP belonging to a data center and one that's being exploited. (Note that Apple users browsing in Safari with Private Relay enabled will likely see \"Possible Spoofed Traffic Detected,\" which also is not necessarily cause for alarm. Try checking your real IP in a different browser like Chrome or Firefox to confirm.)\n\nIf your IP is identified as malicious or suspicious, you should investigate further. If you toggle open the Observed Activity section of the scanner, you can see when the first and last instances of the scanning behavior occurred and what types were detected along with actionable next steps.\n\nAs BleepingComputer notes, you can get into the weeds with detecting malicious activity by reviewing device logs, network traffic, and activity patterns, but checking your IP address is the simplest place to start.",

    "description": "A downgrade in features and an upgrade in quality of life.",
    "fullText": "My concentration is shot. I know this because I've checked my phone four times while writing this opening paragraph. I'm addicted to my phone in a way that feels both embarrassing and completely normal, which is perhaps the most damning part. My phone feels essential for everything: my job requires Slack and email responsiveness, my hobbies live in apps and group chats, and even my downtime involves scrolling through feeds I don't actually enjoy.\n\nThese days, we tend to think of upgrades (in life, in tech, wherever) as adding features, but sometimes the real upgrade is eliminating. So I did something a little radical this year: I bricked my iPhone. Well, sort of. And it's been the best tech decision I've made in years.\n\nWe talk about phone addiction like it's a personal failing, but cut yourself some slack. Every app, every notification, every infinite scroll is designed by engineers whose job is to keep us locked in. As such, we've eliminated almost all empty space from our lives, filling every waiting moment with content consumption. Waiting for the train? Scroll. In line at the store? Scroll. Between tasks at work? Scroll.\n\nI can't afford to go full \"dumb-phone\", so I took a middle path: \"demoting\" my smartphone, so it functions like a dumb phone while retaining genuinely useful features like navigation, ride shares, and FaceTime. Here's what I did:\n\nI turned on grayscale mode. It's amazing how boring your phone becomes when it looks like an old newspaper. That dopamine-triggering red notification badge? Just gray. Instagram's carefully curated visual feast? Gray. Suddenly my phone looked as exciting as a filing cabinet.\n\nI deleted the time-consuming apps. I got rid of the primary social media apps, any news apps that were really just anxiety delivery systems, and more social media apps. If I wanted to check something, I'd have to do it on my computer, which added just enough friction to make me reconsider whether I actually cared.\n\nI turned off non-essential notifications. Actually, I turned off almost all notifications. No badges, no banners, no sounds. My phone became silent unless someone was actually calling me or texting me directly.\n\nI started physically separating myself from my phone during focused work. It went in another room, face down in a drawer, anywhere but within arm's reach. Out of sight, out of the dopamine loop.\n\nThis might sound embarrassing, but it's honest: at first, it felt like phantom limb syndrome. My thumb kept reaching for apps that weren't there. I'd pull out my phone in line at the coffee shop only to stare at a blank screen and think, \"Now what?\" The answer, it turned out, was nothing. And that nothing was exactly what I needed.\n\nThe first week was genuinely uncomfortable. My brain kept expecting hits that weren't coming. I felt anxious, ashamed, humbled, understimulated, almost itchy—which pretty much told me everything I needed to know about how deep the addiction ran.\n\nLuckily, the benefits rolled in faster than I expected. Within two weeks, I noticed I could read for longer stretches. I also think my work as a creative improved. Deep work—the kind where you're tackling genuinely hard problems—requires getting into a flow state. I need at least 20 minutes of uninterrupted focus to even enter that zone, and for me, an Instagram notification shatters it instantly. By removing the interruption infrastructure from my phone, I suddenly had whole mornings where I could think clearly.\n\nAlong with dumbing down my phone, I set an intention to become more observational again. I'd be waiting somewhere and instead of reaching for my phone, I'd just...look around. Watch people. Notice architectural details. Eavesdrop on conversations. Observe the weather shifting. It sounds small, but it completely changed my relationship with being in public spaces.\n\nI believe boredom is where creativity lives. When your mind isn't being constantly fed, it starts generating its own entertainment. I had ideas in the shower again. Real ideas, not just fragments borrowed from something I read online; I had original thoughts that surprised me, connections my brain made when it wasn't being force-fed content. This sounds mundane, but I promise, it's the opposite. This is how thinking actually works when you let it.\n\nEspecially with social media, I'd settled into this constant need to perform my life. While I still find this performance necessary to \"make it\" as a creative these days, I learned that most of my FOMO was an algorithm problem. You're not actually missing out on anything important; you're being shown a curated highlight reel designed to make you feel inadequate. Once you step out of that stream, you realize how much of it was manufactured anxiety. The things I thought I needed to keep up with turned out to be completely forgettable.\n\nMy bricked iPhone is a downgrade in features and an upgrade in life quality. That's the whole story, really.\n\nWe frame phone usage as a personal responsibility issue, but that's like blaming people for getting hooked on substances that were engineered to be addictive. Companies build their algorithms around persuasive technologies. They run A/B tests on features to maximize engagement. They know exactly what they're doing, and what they're doing is turning your attention into profit.\n\nLook, I'd love to go more radical with it, but I have limits. For work, I need to be responsive—Slack messages can't wait three hours. And I genuinely adore getting laughs in a group chat, which is a timely thing. Those moments of connection matter, and I'm not interested in becoming a total digital hermit.\n\nBut going forward, I'm desperate to keep getting my brain back. My ability to think deeply, pay attention, create meaningfully, and connect authentically—these aren't optional luxuries. They're the whole point.\n\nIf your phone feels like it owns you more than you own it, maybe your next upgrade isn't a new model. Maybe it's just making your current one a little more boring, a little less exciting, and a lot more brick-like. Your brain will thank you for it.",

    "description": "Direct navigation isn't without risk.",
    "fullText": "Clicking through search results to a website comes with the risk of landing on a spoofed page that is actually a phishing scam, but so does navigating directly by typing a URL into your browser. As reported by Krebs on Security, researchers at security firm Infoblox have identified a swath of scams on lookalike and parked (or placeholder) domains. If you end up on one of these websites, you'll be directed not to the trusted page you're expecting but scam content, including scareware and other malware.\n\nThis scam capitalizes on you navigating directly to a website by typing the URL into your browser's address bar. If you accidentally mistype either the top-level domain (TLD)—.gov or .com, for example—or the second-level domain (SLD), which is the company name (Google or Amazon), you could land on a page that has been commandeered by threat actors for malicious purposes.\n\nIn some cases, these may be typosquats, meaning cybercriminals have registered domain names that look nearly identical to trusted ones. In others, they may be real domains that have expired and are simply advertising placeholders that spread malware.\n\nInfoblox researchers found that visiting one of these sites often initiates a chain of redirects, through which threat actors profile data like your IP geolocation, device fingerprint, and cookies. That means you don't necessarily need to click any links on the parked page to be served malicious content. They note, though, that parked websites were only malicious if visited from a residential IP address and benign if accessed using a VPN or a non-residential IP.\n\nOne common piece of advice for avoiding phishing websites is to type trusted URLs directly into the address bar rather than clicking through search, as threat actors will try to exploit results, including placing paid ads, to redirect you to malicious domains. This can still be a safe way to get to your destination, but you should check your spelling of both TLDs and SLDs carefully, as small errors could land you on a scam site.\n\nI've covered similar website trickery like homograph attacks, which use lookalike characters in URLs to direct you to phishing sites that, on the surface, appear to be legitimate domains. Unless you inspect the address very carefully, you may not catch the scam.",

The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.\n\nImmigration judges are federal employees, and the question at the center of the appeal is about whether they can sue to challenge a policy restricting their public speeches or if they are required to use a separate complaint system for the federal workforce.\n\nTrump's Republican administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court found that Trump’s firings of top complaint system officials had raised questions about whether it's still working as intended.\n\nThe Justice Department said the firings are within the president’s power and the lower court had no grounds to raise questions. The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to quickly freeze the ruling as he pushes to have the immigration judges’ case removed from federal court.\n\nThe justices declined, though they also said the Trump administration could return if the lower courts moved too fast. There were no noted dissents. The court has allowed most of Trump’s firings for now and is weighing whether to formally expand his legal power to fire independent agency officials by overturning job protections enshrined in a 90-year-old decision.\n\nA union formerly representing immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department, first sued in 2020 to challenge a policy restricting what the judges can speak about in public. They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.\n\nRamya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.\n\nWhile the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.\n\nThe decision comes after a series of wins for the Justice Department on the high court’s emergency docket. The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "Bill Clinton faces renewed questions over the extent of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after he featured heavily in the first tranche of unsealed documents.\n\nDozens of photographs of Mr Clinton with the late paedophile tycoon were released by the Trump administration, including showing him in a hot tub and swimming with Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe pictures are part of the so-called Epstein files that Congress ordered to be released by Dec 19 after mounting public pressure on Donald Trump.\n\nThe US department of justice said “hundreds of thousands” more documents would be released in the coming weeks, suggesting some of the most damaging for the White House could be published over Christmas.\n\nDemocrats accused the Trump administration of censoring the release to protect the US president.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump’s spokesman shared a picture of Mr Clinton relaxing in the hot tub with the comment: “Oh my!”\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor also featured in the first trove of documents, including a picture of him lying in black tie across the laps of five women, below.\n\nMaxwell also features outside 10 Downing Street. Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson are also pictured with Epstein and his associates.\n\nThe Clinton hot tub picture showed the former president lying half-naked with a woman whose face has been redacted.\n\nGates McGavick, a justice department employee, claimed the woman whose face was blocked out was an Epstein victim.\n\nAnother photograph, below, that appeared to be taken on the same occasion also showed Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for trafficking teenage girls to Epstein, in a dimly-lit swimming pool with Mr Clinton.\n\nThe former president was photographed with his arm around a young, blonde woman sitting on his lap on a red velvet chair on a separate occasion. The woman is one of many females in the Epstein files whose face has been redacted.\n\nA similar picture showed Mr Clinton in a red hooded sweatshirt with his arm around a blonde woman.\n\nThe furniture in the background appeared to match that of Epstein’s private jet, nicknamed the “Lolita Express” over allegations that the businessman used it to traffic underage girls to his island in the US Virgin Islands.\n\nFurther images released on Friday showed the 42nd president and Epstein pictured side-by-side with their arms around one another in twin patterned shirts at a dinner function, below, as well as one of Mr Clinton with Michael Jackson.\n\nThe tranche of images also included a framed caricature of Mr Clinton and Epstein getting ready to board an aircraft alongside two unidentified men. The drawing was hung up in a bathroom, thought to belong to Epstein.\n\nMr Trump has sought to draw attention to Epstein’s relationship with Mr Clinton as scrutiny intensified over his own links to the paedophile.\n\nSusie Wiles, Mr Trump’s own chief of staff, said this week in an interview with Vanity Fair that her boss was “in the file” but that “he’s not in the file doing anything awful”.\n\nMr Clinton’s spokesman has repeatedly said the former president did not know about Epstein’s crimes and cut ties with him before his 2019 arrest. He has never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n\nThe politician has previously been photographed with Epstein on a number of occasions in the early 1990s.\n\nHe and Maxwell were pictured speaking with the then-president in September 1993 at an event for donors to a White House restoration project.\n\nEpstein gave two $1,000 donations to Mr Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992.\n\nThrough a spokesman, Mr Clinton described Epstein in 2002 as “both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist”.\n\nA picture of Epstein and Mr Clinton together in Brunei in 2002 appeared in Vanity Fair, about the time he was taking trips on the sex offender’s private jet.\n\nMr Clinton’s spokesman said after Epstein’s arrest for sex trafficking in 2019 that the former president took four trips on the jet between 2002 and 2003, including “stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation” in Africa.\n\nThe 2019 statement confirmed the two men met at Epstein’s Harlem office and at his New York apartment. Mr Clinton is also alleged to have contributed to Epstein’s 50th birthday book in 2003.\n\nJames Comer, the Republican chairman of the House oversight committee, has subpoenaed both Bill and Hillary Clinton to provide in-person depositions into the panel’s Epstein investigation.\n\nThe committee is offering the former president and former secretary of state new deposition dates in January and threatening possible contempt proceedings if they do not comply.\n\nThe Clintons were first subpoenaed in August and have been involved in a legal argument over whether they need to appear in person.\n\nEpstein also kept a cartoon of him and Mr Clinton above what appears to be his toilet, the new files show.\n\nThe photo shows a framed drawing of a muscle-bound Epstein alongside the former president outside of a private jet.\n\nDemocrats on Friday night demanded answers from the Department of Justice as to why so many redactions were made in the documents.\n\nRo Khanna, the congressman behind the Epstein Files Transparency Act, said the initial files protected the identity of “rich and powerful men” complicit in the paedophile’s activities.\n\nMr Khanna claimed Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, could be prosecuted or impeached after “obfuscating for months”.\n\nA document from a New York grand jury has 119 pages “totally blacked out”, with no explanation for the redactions as required by the Act, even though a federal judge had agreed to its release, he said.\n\nFox News reported that the same redaction standards were applied to politically exposed individuals and government officials as they were to victims.\n\nWhite House officials, meanwhile, mocked Mr Clinton for the images released of him with Epstein and various women.\n\nSteven Cheung, a White House communications adviser, said under one picture: “Slick Willy! Bill Clinton just chillin, without a care in the world. Little did he know…”",

Again, it was Kok who has on hand to capitalise and score.\n\nTwo minutes before the break, things got even better for Ulster when Stewart swatted away the challenges of Tector and Lowe to claim Ulster's third.\n\nDespite conceding six penalties in the first half, Ulster's blitz defence was proving effective.\n\nThirteen minutes after the restart, however, Leinster finally got to the outside with Kenny scoring in the corner.\n\nThe Leinster bench had a formidable look to it and the arrival of Paddy McCarthy, Sheehan, Tadhg Furlong and Joe McCarthy was helping to swing the momentum.\n\nLeinster's progress, however, was seemingly halted by a yellow card shown to James Ryan for a dangerous clear-out.\n\nThe first score of the sin-bin came through a Doak penalty but Leinster would outscore Ulster with 14 men thanks to Lowe's try with a quarter of an hour remaining.\n\nClinging to a three-point lead, Ulster were shown a yellow card of their own with referee Andrew Brace judging David McCann's knock-on to be deliberate.\n\nWith the back row's transgression occurring in the 71st minute, the visitors would finish the game a player short and could not hold on for the win.\n\nFive minutes from time, the pressure finally told as Ulster's ill-discipline was punished with a penalty knocked into the corner for Sheehan and his fellow forwards to drive over the line for the winning try.\n\nLeinster will travel to Thomond Park on 27 December to take on Munster with Ulster travelling to Connacht on the same day.\n\nUlster: Stockdale; Baloucoune, Postlethwaite, McCloskey, Kok; Murphy, Doak; Bell, Stewart, O'Toole, Sheridan, Irvine, McCann, Timoney (capt), Augustus.\n\nReplacements: Andrew, Crean, Wilson, Hopes, Ward, McKee, Flannery, McIlroy.\n\nLeinster: Frawley; Kenny, Ioane, Tector, Lowe; Prendergast, McGrath; Boyle, G McCarthy, Slimani, Deeny, Ryan, Soroka, Penny, Conan (capt).\n\nReplacements: Sheehan, P McCarthy, Furlong, J McCarthy, Deegan, Gunne, Byrne, Moloney.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Grady, Adams Cons: Sheedy 2 Pens: Sheedy\n\nTries: James, G Davies 2 Cons: Hawkins 3\n\nA try double from scrum-half Gareth Davies allowed Scarlets to continue their Arms Park dominance against Cardiff in the United Rugby Championship (URC).\n\nIt was the third successive match at the Arms Park where 35-year-old former Wales scrum-half Davies has grabbed a pair of tries.\n\nCentre Eddie James also scored to extend Scarlets' winning run at Cardiff's home ground that goes back to 2019.\n\nIn a pulsating derby, Cardiff dominated territory and possession but could not capitalise on Scarlets' ill-discipline, with yellow cards for Josh Macleod, Davies and Johnny Williams.\n\nThe Blue and Blacks were wasteful in attack as they managed only two tries, through wings Mason Grady and Josh Adams, from more than 20 entries into the Scarlets 22.\n\nIn contrast, the Scarlets' dynamic defence forced Cardiff into many handling errors, as Dwayne Peel's side somehow came away with another victory in the Welsh capital to prevent their hosts from going top of the URC table.\n\nCardiff captain Liam Belcher recovered from a neck injury to be one of six changes from the side that defeated Ulster, while Scarlets were boosted by the return of Wales full-back Blair Murray after Peel rotated his starting side for the 50-21 loss against Bordeaux-Begles.\n\nThe home side dominated the early exchanges and had an early James Botham try disallowed because of a knock-on.\n\nScarlets prop Henry Thomas was lucky to avoid a yellow card after conceding a penalty close to the line, before visiting captain Macleod was given a warning for the amount of transgressions.\n\nThe hosts could not make their pressure tell as Scarlets' defence repelled the wave of attacks.\n\nWith number eight Fletcher Anderson making the hard yards, Scarlets showed their opponents a lesson in ruthlessness as they created the opportunity for centre James to stroll over with Joe Hawkins converting.\n\nMacleod was shown a yellow card for a silly off-the-ball tackle on Sheedy, a decision given by referee Ben Breakspear for the amount of penalties conceded.\n\nScarlets were reduced to 13 men a couple of minutes later when Davies was sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on.\n\nCardiff made their numerical advantage tell when the ball was worked to Grady to score in the left corner, with Sheedy converting from the touchline.\n\nMurray avoided becoming a third Scarlets player to be shown a yellow card when his knock-on was deemed to have been in a tackle when Cardiff had a two-man overlap.\n\nScarlets' dogged defence continued to stand firm and Cardiff had to be content with a Sheedy penalty just before the interval to establish a 10-7 half-time lead.\n\nIt was a half where the visitors conceded 10 penalties as Cardiff dominated territory and possession.\n\nThe second half followed the same script initially as Thomas and James held up Cardiff number eight Alun Lawrence over the Scarlets line.\n\nPeel's side again showed their opponents a clinical edge as scrum-half Davies continued his Arms Park try-scoring love affair by sniping down the side. Hawkins converted to give Scarlets a four-point lead.\n\nThat soon disappeared when Adams was the beneficiary of a clever pinpoint Sheedy chip to expertly score in the corner.\n\nCardiff made multiple changes, including the return of number eight Taulupe Faletau, who has recovered from a knee injury suffered in October that ruled him out of the November Tests.\n\nScarlets would not go away and Davies popped up for a trademark interception 70-metre try.\n\nThe topsy-turvy tie continued as an incisive Faletau break was followed by a third Scarlets yellow card for centre Williams for a professional foul at a ruck.\n\nCardiff could not manage any points with the extra player before Murray was carried off in the 78th minute.\n\nCardiff desperately tried to clinch the win but it was fitting Davies had the final touch as he booted the ball off the field to send Scarlets supporters into raptures.\n\nThis was the first of five Welsh derbies over the festive period with two more on 26 December and pair of games on 1 January.\n\nWhat the local derby scene will look like at the end of next year remains to be seen.\n\nIt is an uncertain time in the domestic game in Wales, with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) proposing to cut one of its four men's professional sides.\n\nWelsh rugby's governing body has said it proposes to grant three licences for men's professional clubs.\n\nThere will be one in Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west, which could result in a survival fight between Swansea-based Ospreys and Scarlets in Llanelli.\n\nAfter temporarily going into administration in April, Cardiff were taken over by the WRU with the governing body expecting to sell the organisation to fresh investors in the new year.\n\nOspreys' owners, Y11 Sport & Media, have been linked with taking over Cardiff, which is another way the governing body could get its wish of losing a men's professional side.\n\nOspreys or the club's owners have so far not commented about the Cardiff rumours which has fuelled concern among supporters surrounding the future of their side.\n\nWhatever happens, one fewer Welsh side could mean fewer rousing derby occasions like this one which was played in front of 11,728 fans.\n\nCardiff: Winnett; Adams, Millard, B Thomas, Grady; Sheedy, A Davies; Southworth, Belcher (capt), Sebastian, McNally, Nott, Botham, D Thomas, Lawrence.\n\nReplacements: E Lloyd, Barratt, Wainwright, Thornton, Mann, Faletau, Mulder, Beetham.\n\nScarlets: Murray; Rogers, James, J Williams, Mee; Hawkins, G Davies; Mathias, Elias, H Thomas, Lousi, Ball, Douglas, Macleod (capt), Anderson.\n\nReplacements: Van Der Merwe, Hepburn, H O'Connor, T Davies, Taylor, A Hughes, Price, J Roberts.\n\nSin-bin: Macleod 26, G Davies 28, J Williams 60.\n\nReferee: Ben Breakspear (Wales)\n\nAssistants: Ben Whitehouse & Ben Connor (Wales)",

I think someone said he made 71 metres with the ball in hand. His collisions are always huge, but Sol actually moves the ball better than people give him credit for.\n\n\"I thought we moved the ball better - or more - than we have done previously which is something we've been working on.\n\n\"We thought we could exploit Gloucester by just moving the ball a little bit more. We've got some very, very good outside backs who like to get the ball in their hands.\n\n\"We always know we can fall back to our set-piece because that is obviously normally a strength of ours.\"\n\nGloucester captain Tomos Williams told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:\n\n'Very disappointing. We had a pretty poor start and then continued the night in the same fashion.\n\n\"It was a lot of our own inaccuracies. We probably got caught in two minds during the game and if you're not fully committed then that's when those inaccuracies come. Fair play to Leicester, they forced some errors as well, I thought they played very well.\n\n\"The try at the end of the first half probably put a dampener on our spirits and then again at the start of the second half. When you concede two tries either side of half-time so close, you're always going to be struggling.\n\n\"Saracens are coming on the 27th for the Christmas game and we need to get our heads down for that game. We're at home and we can't have a performance like that at Kingsholm in front of the locals. We owe them a lot more than that performance, definitely.\"\n\nLeicester: Steward; Radwan, Perese, Kata, Hassell-Collins; Searle, Whiteley; Smith, Blamire, Heyes, Henderson, Wells, Thompson, Reffell (c), Moro.\n\nReplacements: Clare, Haffar, Hurd, Chessum, Williams, van Poortvliet, Bailey, Woodward.\n\n20-minute red card: Clare (67).\n\nGloucester: C Atkinson; Russell, Butler, S Atkinson, Thorley; Byrne, Williams (c); Rapava Ruskin, Blake, Laulala, Thomas, Clark, Basham, Ludlow, Clement.\n\nReplacements: Innard, Ford-Robinson, Fasogbon, Jordan, Taylor, Austin, Knight, Hathaway.",

It’s a lot more people than I thought. His death really shook the city.”\n\nThe owners of the fast food restaurant issued a statement to the news media.\n\nWe are deeply saddened by this tragic incident.

The Friday ruling gives the Mississippi Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to redraw the map.\n\nSection 2, which is the primary way plaintiffs can push back against racially discriminatory election practices, is currently being challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOnce the legislature approves a new map, Aycock wrote that she will move quickly to meet any deadlines necessary to hold the special elections in November 2026.\n\nAycock also wrote that she will defer deciding which seats will be subject to a special election until after the new map has been adopted.\n\nThe order follows a 2022 lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the current map cuts Mississippi’s Delta region — a historically Black area — in half, diminishing the Black vote in the Central District.\n\n“Mississippi is nearly 40% Black, but has never had more than one Black Justice on the nine-member Court,\" Ari Savitzky, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, wrote in a statement. \"We couldn’t be happier to see justice on the horizon.”\n\nIn her August ruling, Aycock noted only four Black people have served on Mississippi’s Supreme Court. All of them held the same seat in the Central District and were first appointed to the position by a sitting governor.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State’s Office is appealing Aycock’s August ruling. The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed its proceedings pending the outcomes of the SCOTUS case and other related cases.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State and Attorney General’s offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn December, two Mississippi Supreme Court justices were appointed to federal judgeships. Gov. Tate Reeves will appoint replacements to serve until new justices can be elected.\n\nIn Mississippi, Supreme Court elections are nonpartisan.",
