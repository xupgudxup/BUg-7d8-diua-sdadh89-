    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals added a cornerback to their roster on Tuesday to replace Garrett Williams, who was placed oninjured reserve with a torn Achilles. They announced, among other roster moves, that they signed cornerback Kalen King from the practice squad of the Carolina Panthers to their active roster.\n\nKing is a 5-11, 190-pound corner who was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 2024 in the seventh round. He spent his rookie season on Green Bay's practice squad. He played one game for the Panthers, logging seven special teams snaps. He has been on their practice squad otherwise.\n\nHe played for Penn State in college. In his collegiate career, he played in 38 games, starting 23 of them. He finished his college career with 82 tackles (58 solo), 5.5 tackles for loss, three interceptions, 28 passes defensed, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery.\n\nWith his addition to the roster, the Cardinals now have seven cornerbacks on the roster — Max Melton, Will Johnson, Denzel Burke, Kei'Trel Clark, Darren Hall, Elijah Jones and King.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Stade Rennais are shaping their winter transfer strategy with a clear objective in mind, injecting greater creativity into a midfield that has often relied on structure rather than invention. As first reported by Ouest-France, the Ligue 1 side have explored the possibility of bringing in Claudio Echeverri, the highly rated Argentine playmaker currently contracted to Manchester City.\n\nThe January transfer window, opening on Thursday January 1, 2026, is expected to be relatively measured in Rennes, but targeted. Sitting sixth at the Christmas break, the Breton club believe that a technical attacking midfielder could provide the marginal gains required to sustain their European push.\n\nRecruitment plans at Roazhon Park have been quietly advancing for weeks. As outlined by Ouest-France, Rennes are keen to “recruit a creative profile to complete its midfield and add technicality to its squad”. That brief has led them to survey options beyond France, with several foreign based players under consideration.\n\nAmong those names is Claudio Echeverri, the 19 year old Argentine international who joined Manchester City from River Plate in 2024 for close to €20 million. Viewed as one of South America’s most refined young creators, Echeverri represents the type of profile Rennes feel could unlock stubborn Ligue 1 defences.\n\nEcheverri’s recent career has been unsettled. Loaned to Bayer Leverkusen last summer, his spell in Germany failed to gain momentum. As Ouest-France reported, his time there proved “not satisfactory”, with 11 appearances in total, including five in the Champions League, and just three starts. The loan has since been terminated.\n\nWhile Rennes have registered interest, the structural reality of the City Football Group complicates matters. Girona, another CFG club, are said to be leading the race, a factor that gives the Spanish side a significant advantage. Rennes, therefore, face stiff competition despite their willingness to move.\n\nAware of the difficulty surrounding Echeverri, Rennes have sensibly activated multiple parallel options. The club understands that patience and flexibility are essential in January. As Ouest-France noted, “whatever the outcome for Echeverri, the club should welcome a reinforcement in this sector of the game”.\n\nThere are internal dynamics driving urgency. Glen Kamara has been encouraged to seek a move, while the January situation of Ludovic Blas remains one to monitor closely. These potential exits add weight to Rennes’ desire to secure a technically gifted midfielder capable of operating between the lines.\n\nThe Echeverri enquiry, therefore, reflects strategic thinking rather than opportunism. Rennes are positioning themselves for both immediate impact and long term value, even if this particular avenue proves difficult to complete.\n\nFrom a Manchester City supporter perspective, this report reads like a familiar chapter in the club’s modern talent management strategy. Claudio Echeverri was never signed for immediate first team integration. His recruitment was about securing elite potential early, trusting the City Football Group ecosystem to find the right environment for development.\n\nThe broken Leverkusen loan does not ring alarm bells. Many City prospects take time to find the correct tactical and cultural fit. What stands out is the consistency of demand. Rennes’ interest, alongside Girona’s stronger position, suggests Echeverri’s stock remains high across Europe.\n\nCity supporters will likely view Girona as the logical next step. The shared philosophy, controlled game model and proven pathway for CFG loanees make Spain an attractive setting. Rennes, while ambitious and well run, cannot offer the same structural alignment.\n\nThat said, the fact Rennes even entered the conversation underlines Echeverri’s perceived ceiling. If he flourishes elsewhere, City fans will see it as validation rather than regret. Development, not destination, remains the priority. In that sense, this report confirms that City’s long term planning around elite young talent continues to function exactly as intended.",

He suffered a hamstring injury early in the Giants’ 16-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday and played just 20 snaps. Thomas has played exceptionally well this season after returning from a Lisfranc injury. If he is compromised at all, it would seem prudent to shut him down. Marcus Mbow would likely play left tackle in Thomas’s place.\n\nSchmitz, the starting center, has had the best season of his three-year career. He suffered a hand injury against the Vikings. Veteran center Austin Schlottmann has done well when forced to fill in for Schmitz this season.\n\nNeal remains on IR.

    "description": "Scott Morrow’s time with the New York Rangers has been a rollercoaster ride this season, but there’s one aspect about his character that you can’t take away.",
    "fullText": "Scott Morrow’s time with the New York Rangers has been a rollercoaster ride this season, but there’s one aspect about his character that you can’t take away.\n\nWhen the Rangers acquired Morrow from the Carolina Hurricanes as part of the sign-and-trade deal involving K’Andre Miller, they were getting a player who was highly successful in the NCAA and American Hockey League level, largely due to his ability to create offense as a defenseman, but he had yet to etch his mark in the NHL.\n\nDespite failing to make the Rangers’ roster out of training camp, Morrow was called up a couple of times, and once Adam Fox landed on long-term injured reserve with an upper-body injury, Morrow got the opportunity to step into the lineup and play a prominent role.\n\nWhen asked about what he wanted to see from Morrow shortly after Fox’s injury, Sullivan gave a blunt answer, a sign that he was simply expecting more out of the young defenseman.\n\n“Assertive play,” Sullivan said about what he wants to see from Morrow. “Making decisions with conviction and not being in between. Eliminating hesitation from his game.”\n\nSince Sullivan’s request for Morrow to play with more assertiveness, he’s been in the lineup for nine games, which has come with its highs and lows.\n\nEven though the 23-year-old defenseman has specialized in the power play at practically every level of hockey, Sullivan decided to utilize a five-forward power-play unit upon Fox’s absence.\n\nAt first, Sullivan didn’t fully trust Morrow to quarterback the first power-play unit.\n\n“We don't think that's the strength of their games to this point,” Sullivan said of why Schneider or Morrow are not playing on the first power-play unit. “We're trying to put a power play together that we think gives us the best opportunity to have success. Obviously, Foxy, I think, is an elite power-play defenseman, with how he distributes the puck up there, the way he sees the game. He's got really good instincts. We don't necessarily think that that's the strength of some of the guys you just mentioned.”\n\nSullivan did emphasize that Morrow was the most equipped defenseman outside of Fox to play on the man advantage.\n\n“We’ve made a decision to go with five forwards at this point, but we know that if we were to use a defensemen, he would be the guy because of the instincts that he has,” Sullivan said.\n\nWith the five-forward unit failing to produce offense, Sullivan recently added Morrow to that first power-play unit.\n\nIn this role, Morrow has gone through a steep learning curve, committing some costly turnovers in the process, showing that there’s still room for him to grow.\n\nFrom an overall standpoint, Morrow has been prone to making some defensive mistakes. Specifically on Saturday afternoon in the Rangers’ game against the Philadelphia Flyers, Morrow committed two costly turnovers, the first one coming on the power play, which led to a shorthanded goal, and the next one taking place in overtime, nearly leading to the game-winning goal.\n\nThrough the mistakes, Morrow has continued to play an assertive game per request from Sullivan, earning his coach’s admiration.\n\n“What I'll say is, he's an incredible kid, and his ability to shrug off some of the plays and continue to perform out there, I think, speaks volumes for the character of what he's about,” Sullivan said. “He's a young player. He's going to make some mistakes, and let's be honest, we're putting him in some really high-profile positions, whether it be on the power play and overtime, things of that nature. He's playing a significant role here with this group right now, especially with Foxy being out, and so I think he's done a great job with just playing through the ups and the downs.\n\nRangers Put Scoring Barrage On Display En Route To Comeback Win Over Capitals In a season filled with scoring woes, the New York <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/new-york-rangers\">Rangers</a> flipped the switch on Tuesday night, scoring five goals in the third period against the Washington Capitals, en route to a 7-3 win.&nbsp;\n\n“I think that's what you get when you deal with young players, especially defensemen. I said this to you guys all the time, I think it's the hardest position to play, but I admire his resilience because that would affect a lot of young players the wrong way. When you watch Scotty play, if he makes a mistake, he shrugs it off, he learns from it. We couldn't be more proud of him for his ability to respond to those situations.”\n\nSullivan has continued to roll with Morrow on the first power-play unit and give him heavy minutes despite some of his defensive blunders, not trying to punish Morrow for mistakes as he continues to develop.\n\nOn Tuesday night in the Rangers’ 7-3 win over the Washington Capitals, Morrow played arguably his best game of the season.\n\nHe led all Rangers defenseman with a 2.50 Game Score, an analytical stat used to quantify a player's single-game impact, blending goals, assists, shots, penalties, faceoffs, and 5v5 goal/Corsi differentials (shot attempts) into one number, with higher scores indicating better overall performance in that specific game.\n\nMorrow clearly has the talent to transform into an impactful NHL defenseman. Now it’s about fully adapting to the speed of the NHL game and providing more of a reliable presence for the Rangers, something that should come with time.",

    "fullText": "After losing to the New York Knicks in the playoffs last year, the Boston Celtics know that New York isn’t going away anytime soon. The same can be said for any other hopeful contender in the Eastern Conference: to each of them, the Knicks are a legit barrier.\n\nAfter a rocky start to the season, which had New York’s decision to fire Tom Thibodeau not looking great, the Knicks have bounced back, stabilized, and begun to excel again. They already had a bunch of roster talent in place, of course, but new head coach Mike Brown has added some wrinkles that have improved the Knicks along the margins.\n\nOne of those wrinkles is the emergence of second-year point guard Tyler Kolek, who has received more opportunity from Brown than he did from Thibodeau.\n\nSure, part of this has to do with Kolek being a year older and more experienced, but another part of it is that Brown is more liberal with his rotation than Thibs, who famously plays the same six or seven players into the ground (and has found his own success with it, to his credit).\n\nKolek only appeared in 41 games last year, at a 7.2 minutes per game rate. The Marquette guard has already appeared in 25 games this season under Brown, averaging 12.7 minutes per game as Jalen Brunson’s full-time backup.\n\nOn Tuesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Brown gave Kolek his first career start, and Kolek did not disappoint in the slightest.\n\nThe 24-year-old lefty flirted with a triple-double, dropping 20 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and three steals in a statement performance.\n\nTyler Kolek in his first NBA start:\n\n20 Points (41% FG)\n11 Rebounds\n8 Assists\n3 Steals pic.twitter.com/Qt1k6CWGFD\n\n— KnicksMuse (@KnicksMuse) December 24, 2025\n\nKolek’s growing confidence is a wonderful development for the Knicks, just as much as it’s a terrible development for the rest of the East. The Knicks have struggled in recent years to find a viable backup who can spell Brunson without presiding over a severe drop-off in quality. Kolek isn’t going to be Brunson out there, obviously, but he can more than hold his own running an offense, and he’s a threat to score, too. This means the Knicks just leveled up as a team when Brunson is resting.\n\nNew York was two wins away from the NBA Finals last season. If they can improve marginally, they can take a step further. Kolek represents a small improvement to the depth chart that might help New York take that step.\n\nHe might seem like an inconsequential element in the East arms race, but look closer, and you’ll realize the importance of Kolek’s rise.\n\nKnicks’ Jalen Brunson Responds To Foul Baiting Accusations",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Timberwolves head to the Mile High City for a Christmas night showdown with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nAfter dominating the series in recent years, the Timberwolves saw their six-game winning streak over the Nuggets snapped earlier this season.\n\nDenver will likely be without three starters, which is a big reason my Timberwolves vs. Nuggets predictions and NBA picks include a road cover on Thursday, December 25.\n\nTimberwolves vs Nuggets best bet: Timberwolves +3.5 (-110)\n\nThe Denver Nuggets knew they'd be down two starters. Neither Christian Braun (ankle) nor Aaron Gordon (hamstring) has played at all in December.\n\nGordon scored a total of 32 points in Denver's two previous wins over Minnesota this season. Braun only played in one, scoring seven.\n\nThe surprise was shooter Cameron Johnson, who went down with an apparent knee injury against Dallas in the last game. He was scheduled for a Christmas Eve MRI, but limped immediately afterward and is day-to-day for the game.\n\nThe Nuggets' depth has helped Denver flip the series against Minnesota. After losing six straight to the T-Wolves, 1-5 ATS, heading into the season, the Nuggets won and covered both games this year.\n\nHowever, with three of the six double-figure scorers potentially unavailable due to the team surrounding Nikola Jokic, that depth will be depleted in the holiday rematch.\n\nDenver is 1-2, straight up and ATS, since its six-game winning streak ended. The hot stretch was a bit of fool's gold, since it included just two winning teams and opponents with a combined .404 winning percentage.\n\nThe Nuggets have also lost to 12-19 Dallas twice in the last 10 games.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have pulled within a game and a half of Denver, riding a three-game winning streak and a 5-1 ATS run. The T-Wolves have covered their last three as underdogs, dating back to before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe game total seems high given that both teams rank in the lower half of the league in pace. Minnesota has gone Under in five straight and seven of the last nine, all against significantly lower game total cutoffs.\n\nDenver has been Under the game total in two of the last three and has played a long string of faster-paced teams, with 10 of the previous 14 games coming against teams ranked in the top half of the NBA's tempo rankings.\n\nIf Cameron Johnson doesn't play, Denver will be down an outside threat, which would seem to make it easier to team up on Jokic, but his assists actually have gone up when a shooting threat is out.\n\nJokic had 11 dimes against Minnesota in a game Johnson missed earlier this year and had 14 against Indiana when Jamal Murray was out.\n\nGuarding Jokic is a big job, and as one of the league's most-honored defenders, Rudy Gobert will take on a large portion of that job. That means paying less attention and expending less energy at the other end of the floor.\n\nGobert has scored a total of 12 points and taken a total of 10 shots in the first two games against Denver this season.\n\nSpread: Timberwolves +4.5 (-110) | Nuggets -4.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Timberwolves +155 | Nuggets -190\n\nOver/Under: Over 230.5 (-110) | Under 230.5 (-110)\n\nThe Denver Nuggets have hit the Game Total Over in 57 of their last 97 games (+13.03 Units / 12% ROI).

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEven after consecutive wins -- including an impressive takedown of the Orlando Magic -- the Golden State Warriors are stuck in Western Conference no man's land.\n\nAt 15-15, the Warriors sit eighth in the standings, and 3.5 games back of the sixth-place Houston Rockets.\n\nGolden State has one of the oldest rosters in the NBA, and championship-winning head coach Steve Kerr has been embroiled in controversy over his management of the franchise's young players like Jonathan Kuminga. Some observers believe the Warriors need a drastic shake-up.\n\nMORE: Warriors linked to stunning Draymond Green trade with division rival\n\nThe Ringer's Bill Simmons has proposed a radical solution: the Warriors should deal franchise legend Steph Curry to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for LaMelo Ball and a package of draft picks.\n\n\"(Curry) grew up there, his dad (Dell Curry) is there, he's always joked about ending his career there,\" Simmons said on his eponymous podcast. \"I don't think this Warriors team has any chance. We just saw Draymond (Green) blow up last night. Can we just do LaMelo and a bunch of picks, send Curry back to Charlotte, and let's just go?\"\n\n🎙️ @BillSimmons: \"Are we at the point where Curry to Charlotte, we should just do it?\"\n\n\"I don't think this Warriors team has any chance.

But it does add something to the swirling debate over Golden State's long-term outlook.\n\nCurry, 37, is under contract through next year and is slated to make $62 million in 2026-27. The Warriors' championship window appears closed, with West powers Oklahoma City and San Antonio set up well for the future.\n\nThe Hornets have not made the playoffs in nine years, and a backcourt of Curry and Kon Knueppel would shoot the lights out. Ball's own long-term outlook in Charlotte is murky, and his reputation around the NBA is not exactly stellar.\n\nIt's a trade that has little chance of happening -- but for former Davidson College hero Curry, it would be a really cool homecoming.\n\nNew Stephen Curry video has Warriors fans convinced he has the worst whistle in the NBA\n\nThis Draymond Green stat is atrocious for Warriors legend\n\nMavs' Cooper Flagg reveals his Christmas list after epic night in win over Nuggets\n\nWembanyama's historic streak ends in blowout win over Thunder",

    "description": "The Rams might prioritize a deep postseason run over playing Davante Adams in final two weeks.",
    "fullText": "The health of Los Angeles Rams receiver Davante Adams is the biggest question mark heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.\n\nAdams missed Week 16 with a hamstring injury he sustained in Week 15, and his availability for Week 17 is in question despite head coach Sean McVay saying Adams is making \"really good progress\" this week.\n\nWith a playoff spot locked up and only seeding at stake, ESPN NFL insider Jeremy Fowler reported Wednesday that a team source told him \"it wouldn't be a surprise to see Adams miss Week 18 vs. Arizona\" if Adams also misses the Falcons game.\n\n\"The goal is to ensure Adams is 100 percent for the first week of the playoffs,\" Fowler wrote.\n\nThis is similar to what ESPN's Adam Schefter and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported recently, too. At 33 years old, it wouldn't make sense to rush Adams back from a soft tissue injury that's nagged at him all year.\n\nWhile playoff seeding matters, the Rams proved in Week 16 that they can compete with their top red zone threat. L.A. wracked up a season-high 581 offensive yards in the overtime loss to the Seattle Seahawks, including 457 yards and three touchdowns from quarterback Matthew Stafford. Puka Nacua is a clear No. 1 offensive threat, and the auxiliary pass-catchers proved to be effective enough in Adams' stead.\n\nAt this point in the season, health in the playoffs matters more than regular-season wins.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams could shut down Davante Adams until playoffs, per NFL insider",

    "fullText": "Matt Patricia is used to postseason runs from his days as the defensive coordinator of the New England Patriots.\n\nHowever, Patricia acknowledges that the preparation for the College Football Playoff is different than the NFL. Patricia is in his first season as Ohio State's defensive coordinator as the second-seeded Buckeyes (12-1) get ready to face 10th-seeded Miami (11-2) in a CFP quarterfinal at the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 31.\n\n“It’s a learning (process) for me. We’d have bye-week kind of moments in the NFL, but this is a really long layover and break,” Patricia said. “Right now, I’m trying to trust the expertise in the building. Some of the things we did transfer, you know, because we have some different kind of scheduling and when everybody is in school and that stuff.”\n\nOhio State was off for two weeks after its 13-10 loss to Indiana in the Big Ten championship game on Dec. 6. Players were mostly occupied with final exams while waiting to see who they would face in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nWith the Buckeyes going for consecutive national championships for the first time in school history, Patricia's first season in Columbus has exceeded expectations. He was hired after Jim Knowles left for Penn State, tasked with leading a unit that returned only three starters, none on the defensive line.\n\nPatricia and Ohio State made an emphatic opening statement in their Aug. 30 14-7 victory over Texas and continued the momentum throughout the season.\n\nThe Buckeyes are ranked either first or second nationally in nine different categories. They lead the nation in scoring defense (8.2 points per game), passing yards (129.1), red zone scores (66.7%) and fewest plays of 10 or more yards (90).\n\nOhio State had three AP All-America first-team selections on the defense — defensive tackle Kayden McDonald, linebacker Arvell Reese and safety Caleb Downs. All three plus linebacker Sonny Styles are projected to be first-round picks in April's NFL draft.\n\nPatricia, who returned to coaching in college for the first time since 2002, is a finalist for the Broyles Award, which is given to the top assistant coach in college football.\n\n“The players have done an unbelievable job. Again, give them all the credit. I think they’ve played so hard and aggressive and flying around on the field. And it is a lot of fun. I tell them all the time, it’s such a privilege to be up there in front of the group and talk to the group,” Patricia said. “And just for me, personally, it has been so much fun to come back to college and have that little bit of a youthful energy with the players that we have here and their excitement to go out and play.”\n\nWhen Patricia was hired, many lauded his ability to adjust his personnel by running multiple fronts and coverages. He also has shown the ability to relate to players.\n\n“When he first stepped on campus here, it was like a long-lost family member that just came back from whatever he came from, but he came back home,” defensive end Kenyatta Jackson said. “And I mean, all the guys love him. Even offensive guys. He don’t just talk to the starters or whatever the case may be, but he talks to everybody. And I think that’s why everybody loves him.”\n\nOne person who hasn't been surprised with Patricia's success is the guy who hired him.\n\n“His background speaks for itself and putting guys into a situation to be successful. And every player just wants someone that’s going to be there to get them better but also wants someone to care about them. He’s done both of those things,\" coach Ryan Day said. \"It’s great to have somebody in the building who has been through some of the games he’s been through, the Super Bowls and a lot of playoff games, so there’s a confidence level the guys have in him. So, I think all of that adds up to what you’re seeing.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "Packers coach Matt LaFleur said he does not have a good feel for who his quarterback will be this week against the Ravens.",
    "fullText": "GREEN BAY – On the day before Christmas, Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur spoke with the media as his team prepares to host the Baltimore Ravens on Dec. 27. Here are some quick highlights.\n\nJordan Love remains in concussion protocol but will practice Dec. 24 one day after going through a walk-through.\n\nLaFleur said he does not have a good feel for who his quarterback will be this week, and the same uncertainty exists with the Ravens with starter Lamar Jackson dealing with a back injury. He indicated it’s unusual to reach this point in game week – with a Saturday night kickoff, it’s a short week – without knowing either quarterback.\n\n“I would anticipate knowing prior to game day,” LaFleur said about Love’s status.\n\n“Who knows?” LaFleur said. “I really don’t know. To answer your question, I’m going to retract what I said and say, especially when you’re talking about – I don’t even like to say the C-word [concussion] – it’s just a very delicate issue. We’ve seen it with certain guys, they come in, they feel great one day, and then the next day they don’t. So it really is kind of a moving target.”\n\nBehind Love, backup quarterback Malik Willis is dealing with a shoulder injury. Willis injured his shoulder on a sack shortly before the end of regulation and continue to play in overtime against the Chicago Bears based on “adrenaline” and the realization nobody else was behind him.\n\nThe Packers’ third quarterback is Clayton Tune, but he is on the practice squad. Tune would need to be activated to the 53-man roster to be available against the Ravens.\n\nLaFleur said the only option, both for him and the Ravens, is to lay out their best plan for whoever might play.\n\n“It’s the situation,” LaFleur said. “So you just prepare the best you can and try to lay out a great plan for whoever’s out there and go play.”\n\nIt’s unlikely the Packers will find themselves in position to need an emergency quarterback, but they would turn to running back Josh Jacobs or receiver Jayden Reed if they do.\n\nNeither would have much preparation for the position given how few practice reps the Packers provide for an emergency quarterback throughout the year.\n\n“I would say pretty minimally,” LaFleur said. “I mean, I think that’s standard throughout the course of most teams I’ve been on. If you have to get to that situation, it’s pretty dire, obviously. I mean, San Fran, I know, in the (2023 NFC championship game against Philadelphia) was almost to that point, and did Brock (Purdy) go back in or whatever, couldn’t really throw the ball. It’s not a great situation to be in, but certainly you spend a little bit of time just working through the mechanics of that. Because it’s not like you’re going to go out there and play defense the whole game. So you’re going to try to move the football, but it’s a less than ideal situation.”\n\nThe 49ers used running back Christian McCaffrey and fullback Kyle Juszcyk as emergency quarterbacks in what became a blowout loss at the Eagles with a Super Bowl on the line, perhaps the most notorious use of the unlikely role. Purdy also returned to that game after injuring his elbow when backup Josh Johnson left with a concussion, though he couldn’t throw.\n\nLaFleur said he has certain criteria for deciding his emergency quarterback, even if it’s unlikely they’ll ever be used.\n\n“A lot of it is just based on guys,” LaFleur said, “what they’ve done in their past. A lot of these guys that we have, have been high school quarterbacks, have maybe dabbled with some Wildcat stuff. So there are some options there. We have multiple guys who have that in their past.”\n\nThe Packers altered their Christmas Day schedule to accommodate families, but they will be working on the holiday.\n\nMost of the morning will be spent at home before the team commences meetings at 11 a.m. The Packers will have a “condensed” practice on what will be the typical Friday of their game week.\n\n“We’re still going to treat it like a Friday,” LaFleur said. “It’s modified, but I think it’s important for really all these guys. I’m sure our players have family in town. To spend some quality time with their family is a good thing.”\n\nLaFleur said it will be an especially early Christmas at his home before he jets off to Lambeau Field.\n\n“I’m sure we’ll be getting up early in my house and opening presents,” LaFleur said. “About the minute we’re done doing that we’ll be back in the office. I don’t think my wife thought I was a good boy this year, so I don’t think she got me anything. I was on the naughty list.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers News: Packers quarterback situation remains fluid; Jordan Love to practice",

    "description": "The Rams have dominated overall, but late-game execution issues continue to cost them in close moments.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams have lost four games this season and all four of them have one thing in common. This is a team that has too often disappeared in the fourth quarter when it matters most. That was the complete opposite in 2021 when the Rams won the Super Bowl\n\nA common them in all four of the Rams’ losses is that the offense had a chance to take the lead or tie the game late. While Stafford had three fourth-quarter comebacks and three game-winning drives in 2021, he has just one this season against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nIn the loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Josh Karty’s game-winning kick was blocked. After Stafford led the offense to the one-yard line against the San Francisco 49ers, Kyren Williams fumbled at the goal line when a touchdown would have given the Rams the lead. With the offense in field goal range against the Carolina Panthers, Stafford fumbled. Finally, last week against the Seattle Seahawks, the Rams blew a 16-point lead as the offense went three-and-out multiple times and Harrison Mevis missed a 48-yard field goal.\n\nThe defense has had moments. They held their ground in the Week 1 win to the Houston Texans and got the game-clinching interception against the Indianapolis Colts. The defense forced the Seahawks to use clock and settle for a 61-yard field goal in Week 11 that was missed. However, there are stretches in the fourth quarter where the defense tends to disappear.\n\nPerformance in 1-Score Games \n\nHere are some different conditions and overall performance of the defense in 1-score games (excluding games that are not close). \n\nAs we can see, the Rams defense performs the worst when the Rams have a 90%+ chance to win. \n\n22% explosive rate… pic.twitter.com/eCxpoFGslo\n\n— Josh (@JoshiosTweets) December 20, 2025\n\nThe Rams defense was built to thrive in situations in which they are leading by double-digits and can unleash the pass rush. With that said, too often this season, that’s when teams have had the most success. Because teams are having to throw the ball more from behind, it has left the secondary more vulnerable, especially if the pass rush isn’t getting home.\n\nOddly enough, this is when the Rams defense has seemingly struggled the most. They’ve struggled with a positive game script. While they still do well in third-and-long situation, they haven’t found that same success when having a lead. When teams are forced to throw on early downs and play catch-up, they are having success. Jalen Hurts hadn’t thrown for over 200 yards or a single touchdown pass. Hurts eclipsed 200 yards against the Rams while throwing three second half touchdowns. The ethos of the defense is to limit explosive plays. Yet, the fourth quarter is when they are allowing them the most. The Rams defense has allowed a 36.9 percent explosive play rate in the fourth quarter and overtime.\n\nSince 2023 in OT, the Rams defense is\n\n4th worst in Success Rate (63%)\n5th worst in EPA Allowed (6.93)\n13th worst in Explosive Rate (17.1%)\n\nThis season, the Rams defense has allowed 36.9% of all explosive plays in the 4th quarter + overtime, the highest in the league. https://t.co/zvzlfxs2GN\n\n— Josh (@JoshiosTweets) December 20, 2025\n\nThis isn’t to say that this Rams team isn’t great because they’ve faltered late in close games. The Rams are 4-4 in one-score games this season. It’s almost more impressive that in a league that prides itself on close games, the Rams haven’t found themselves in those situations often. Since the bye week, the Rams have won games by an average of 17.3 points.\n\nStafford may not have his fourth quarter comebacks and game-winning drives, but it’s not as if he isn’t playing well. Stafford’s 0.34 EPA per play in the fourth quarter ranks second among quarterbacks. Defensively, the Rams still ranked 11th with -0.03 EPA per play. That’s better than they were in 2021 at 0.06. The Rams have the fourth-best fourth quarter offense.\n\nThere are 23 quarters of football where the Rams defense did not force a single negative play (excluding turnovers).\n\nAlthough blowouts and game script can explain some, the quarters below showcase the struggle to disrupt the game when it matters most. ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/p6fgfMJBOL\n\n— Josh (@JoshiosTweets) December 23, 2025\n\nFootball is a complementary sport. When one unit isn’t at its best, the other needs to be able to carry the load during that stretch. That’s happened in several games this season. The defense held up in the Week 11 win to the Seahawks, especially in the second and third quarters when the offense couldn’t move the ball. When the defense struggled in Week 10, the offense scored 42 points against the 49ers.\n\nHowever, too often this season, both units disappear at the same time. After the Rams went up 26-7 against the Eagles, they didn’t score on their next four possessions as the defense allowed three touchdowns in four drives. To start the game against the 49ers, the defense allowed 17 points on the first four drives on the field while the offense didn’t score until 2:09 was left in the second quarter.\n\nThere are 9 quarters of football where the Rams defense did not record a pressure via NGS. Some notable quarters:\n\nWeek 11 Quarter 1 vs. SEA\nWeek 13 Quarter 3 at CAR\nWeek 16 Quarter 1 at SEA\nWeek 16 Quarter 2 at SEA\n\n— Josh (@JoshiosTweets) December 23, 2025\n\nThat continued in Week 16 against the Seahawks. The offense went five straight possessions without a score in the fourth quarter. While the defense only allowed one touchdown drive, it was an explosive play and they allowed two two-point conversions. That doesn’t mention the one that they allowed in overtime.\n\nDuring the 2021 season, it was almost a given that if Matthew Stafford had the ball with the game on the line, the Rams were going to win. That just hasn’t happened this season. When Stafford has put the Rams in position to win late, special teams or the players around him have faltered. Even when they haven’t, Stafford had the fumble against the Panthers.\n\nIn the late game situations, the Rams simply haven’t been as good as they have been in years past. While the Rams have blown out teams this season, the margins are going to get thinner in the playoffs. The Rams have won multiple one-score games consecutively and they’ll need to be able to string a few of those wins together to win the Super Bowl.",

    "description": "Logan Paul defends his brother Jake from criticism over Anthony Joshua bout.",
    "fullText": "Logan Paul says people have it all wrong about how his brother fought Anthony Joshua.\n\nThis past Friday, Jake Paul squared off with Anthony Joshua in a heavyweight boxing bout. It was a big step up for Paul, who not only gave up a huge edge in experience but also one in size, and the YouTuber-turned-boxer suffered the consequences as a result, getting knocked out viciously in the sixth round. Even before the knockout, Paul’s performance drew criticism as “The Problem Child” did his best to avoid getting hit by Joshua, circling the ring and, at times, appearing to turn clinches into takedown attempts. But Logan says that’s not what happened.\n\n“I felt like if Jake’s cardio was better, he would have had a real shot at least to make it to the scorecards,” Paul said on his IMPAULSIVE YouTube channel.\n\n“And everyone wondering about Jake’s strategy … Moving around the outside, everyone’s saying, ‘Oh, he ran the whole time!’ No, that’s boxing. That’s what Floyd Mayweather built his career off of. Especially when you’re facing a bigger guy who controls the center of the ring, the only way to properly win is stay on your horse, pivot, switch directions, make him miss. That’s the name of the game. That’s elusiveness. That’s evasion. That’s good.\n\n“The one thing I did see Jake do in sparring, that everyone else saw last night, when Anthony Joshua would lean on Jake, he would go to his knee. Now, most people thought, ‘Oh, Jake’s trying to take him down.’ He’s not trying to take Anthony Joshua down. I saw this in sparring, and I asked him, ‘Why do you keep going to your knee when the big guy is above you and leans on you?’ He said, ‘They’re so heavy, me trying to hold them up wastes so much energy. If I’m under them and they start leaning on me, I’m just going to drop to my knee, because why would I waste energy trying to keep them up? For what purpose other than to get exhausted?’\n\n“It’s a strategy that optically looks very bad, but it’s conservation of energy.”\n\nLogan went on to compare Jake’s strategy to the inverse of one he employed during his exhibition boxing bout with Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2021.\n\n“Speaking of which, when I fought Floyd, part of my strategy, I go, ‘When this little f*cker is beneath me, I’m putting all of my weight on him,’ Paul said. ”And by the end of the fight, I heard Floyd Mayweather, who never gets tired, doing [heavy breathing]. He was breathing heavy, because that’s hard to pick up a person 40, 50 pounds heavier than you. So Jake didn’t even bother and just dropped to a knee. And then one time it kind of backfired to Anthony landing on top of him and Anthony’s knee [went into Jake’s stomach.]”\n\nWhatever the strategy, Jake ended up getting brutally knocked out, with Joshua breaking his jaw in two places. But despite the loss, Jake is happy with his performance, and Logan is especially proud of his baby brother.\n\n“I think one thing that is undeniable is your chin,” Logan said. “I mean, anyone who questioned whether or not you had a chin, I think the answer to that question was proven last night. Bro, you can take a shot. Anthony Joshua hits you with probably his hardest shot, that we’ve seen drop every other single fighter that he’s fought, and he hit you in the face, and not only did you not get knocked out, you dropped and said, ‘Wow.’”",

    "description": "The Carolina Panthers need to replicate the recipe they used to beat the Rams a few weeks ago.",
    "fullText": "This game probably doesn’t even matter. The Carolina Panthers could technically clinch the NFC South with a win and a Buccaneers loss to Quin Ewers and the Dolphins. The likelihood of both those things happening seems minuscule, but the Bucs are losing to everybody and the Panthers beat the Rams that one time, so you never know. If the Panthers do lose, next Sunday will be for the division title.\n\nThe Seahawks possess arguably the best defense in the league. They are first in defensive DVOA, fourth in EPA per play, fourth in success rate, and second in opponent yards per play. They got caught up in a shootout against the Rams last week, but prior to that, they had given up 25 total points in their previous three games. There is no weak area in this group. They pressure the passer, limit passing yards, and swallow up opposing run games. Playing against this defense is an exercise in survival.\n\nThe recipe for a win over the Seahawks is exactly the same as it was against the Rams. The Panthers executed the plan perfectly, and they’ll have to do it again. Here’s how it works:\n\nRun the ball and sustain long drives. The first key in beating a team that’s superior in just about every way is to minimize the total number of possessions in the game. Fewer possessions means more noise and fewer drives in which the Panthers have to keep pace with Seattle. That means they need to grind out positive yards on runs, get timely completions and high percentage throws from Bryce Young, and go for and convert fourth downs. Punts back to the Seahawks just give them more chances to score. The Panthers need to hold the ball as long as they can. This is a case where time of possession actually matters.\n\nDo not turn the ball over. This is obvious. It’s important in every game. But the Panthers are going to need to win the turnover battle to win the game. That becomes infinitely harder against a very good offense if the Panthers offense is giving the ball away. It also undermines key number one. You can’t have long possessions if you’re giving the ball away in the middle of them.\n\nHit big plays. We saw the Panthers do this against the Rams with long completions on fourth downs. While the Panthers do need to simply keep the chains moving as much as possible, they’re going to need to mix in a few big plays to put points on the board. It’s going to be very hard to move all the way down the field and score touchdowns by dinking and dunking on every drive. The Panthers need to find spots between all the chain moving to hit deep strikes so they don’t have to win on every play against a defense that’s significantly better than this offense.",

    "fullText": "Chris Oladokun’s friend, Jake, texted last Saturday night to say he was making the drive from Asheville, North Carolina, to Nashville, where the Chiefs were facing the Tennessee Titans the next day. It would be cool, Jake told him, to see his friend in a Chiefs uniform as the team’s understudy at quarterback.\n\nBut as Jake entered Nissan Stadium and looked up at the video board, he got an eyeful. There was No. 19 for the Chiefs on the field.\n\n“And he’s like, ‘Is Chris in the game?’” Oladokun said.\n\nYes, he was. A knee injury to starter Gardner Minshew, who was subbing for the injured Patrick Mahomes, meant the first serious playing time in his NFL career for the former Sickles and Alonso High School standout.\n\nOladokun has played in numerous preseason games for the Chiefs since joining the team in 2022 and in last season’s regular-season finale at Denver Oladokun logged five mop-up snaps in his NFL debut.\n\nThis was different. Oladokun was the man on the spot. It didn’t end in victory, with the Chiefs absorbing a 26-9 loss. But Oladokun received encouraging feedback and personally felt good about his 31-snap appearance. He completed 11 of 16 passes for 111 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.\n\n“There’s always something to clean up,” said Oladokun, who played his first three college seasons at USF before finishing at South Dakota State and being a seventh-round draft pick by the Steelers in 2022.\n\nOladokun said every offensive possession started with teammates providing reassurance, especially guard Trey Smith.\n\n“Every single drive,” Oladokun said. “Trey would look back at me, and he’s like, ‘I’ve got your back.’ It speaks to his character and the whole offense that they rallied behind me like that.”\n\nOffensive coordinator Matt Nagy said he knew Oladokun was ready soon after entering the game early in the second quarter. The Chiefs had called a play with jet motion, where a slot receiver is moving at full speed across the formation before the snap. But the timing was off.\n\n“What (Oladokun) did was stop him, he stopped the motion, let him get set and got the back in the right spot and made a simple play,” Nagy said. “That speaks to his calm and where he was early in the game.”",

    "fullText": "Urban Meyer swings for fences with eye-opening prediction for Ohio State-Miami Cotton Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOhio State-Miami is a critical College Football Playoff matchup that could be a blueprint for how the inevitable national title game stacks up. Should the Buckeyes make their second straight appearance, beating a talented ACC opponent could be the return to the Buckeyes' winning ways.\n\nTo do so, however, former Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer offered a simple game plan for his former team to leave Arlington victorious New Year's Eve: clean, complementary football with control in all three phases.\n\nMore specifically, the offensive side of the ball as they expect wide receiver Jeremiah Smith to be a key vocal point for quarterback and Heisman Trophy finalist, Julian Sayin, to throw to. as often as possible.\n\nMeyer spoke about the matchup on a recent edition of \"The Triple Option\" podcast, characterizing it as a mismatch for the Hurricanes despite their defense. They pulled through against the Texas A&M Aggies, 10-3, this past Saturday.\n\n\"I think Ohio State covers,\" Meyer said if he were to bet the game. \"I just don’t know how Miami is going to score points against the top defense in the land.

    "description": "How some former Tar Heels are doing as we enter a transition point in the season",
    "fullText": "I know there are different perspectives on how much we should care about players who have left the program, so maybe this article doesn’t interest everybody. Me personally? I think that one of the best ways to fight against college sports feeling so mercenary is to really believe that every stop on someone’s journey is important, and for our purposes here, that means treating even a brief stop in Chapel Hill like it mattered. In the context of a lifetime, even four years isn’t a whole lot, after all, and yet my four years in Chapel Hill certainly changed my life. I can believe that a year can leave an imprint. And, of course, even players who have left can affect a program down the line — there’s maybe no more prominent example right now than Caleb Love’s influence on Henri Veesaar’s decision to come to UNC.\n\nAnyways. It hasn’t been documented as much as with the football team, because the men’s basketball team is actually good, but UNC men’s basketball turned over nearly an entire roster between last year and this one. A couple of players graduated and one, Drake Powell, is now playing in the NBA. But a whole host of them are still playing college basketball, and as nonconference schedules around the country are coming to a close, I thought it would be as good a time as any to check in on those players and see how their new homes are treating them.\n\nElliot Cadeau has started every game for Michigan during an 11-0 start that has the Wolverines as the #2 team in the country. His averages are nearly the same as they were last year: 10.1 points, 5.8 assists, and 3.1 rebounds per game compared to 9.4/6.2/2.9 as a sophomore, but he’s shooting much better from distance (43.5% on about 4 attempts a game), has improved his A:TO ratio from 2:1 to 2.4:1, and has been his team’s hero a few times already, including making several game-winning plays in their overtime win against Wake Forest. Perhaps most stunning is his improvement on defense: He’s brought his Defensive Rating down from 107.9 points/100 possessions to 92.4. That can be a team-dependent stat, but it’s backed up by Evan Miyakawa’s DBPR rating him as one of the 50 most impactful defenders in the country, right in the neighborhood of Henri Veesaar. It appears a fresh start has indeed done him some good, and his ability to elevate his teammates is on full display as the Wolverines are playing some of the best ball in the NCAA.\n\nIan Jackson has had an up-and-down start to the season for Rick Pitino and St. John’s, but to be fair, that’s the case for the Red Storm as a team, who are 8-4 after starting the season ranked in the top 10 with championship aspirations. Jackson started the first game but played just 15 minutes even though he went 6/6 from the field — if you’re doing that but not collecting basically any other stats, you’re probably not playing team basketball. He proceeded to come off the bench for their next six games, during which time he was more active on the court but less efficient as a scorer, shooting just 42% from the field and 29% from three-point range. Pitino has put him back in the starting lineup of late and results have been better, as he’s averaging a 12/4/2/1 statline in his last four games as a starter. His stats are basically in line with what he did for UNC last year, but he appears to be slowly becoming a more complete basketball player. Consistency still appears to be an adventure, though — I watched him when St. John’s played Kentucky, and after a stellar first half, he essentially ran cardio while the Wildcats mounted a second-half comeback. Again, though, that’s kind of what happened to his whole team, so maybe that’s not so much on him.\n\nCade Tyson is probably the biggest surprise on this list. His year in Chapel Hill made it look like he just wasn’t ready for the jump to power-conference basketball from Belmont — he was physically overwhelmed playing as a small-ball 4, and an outside jumper that was supposed to be his strength looked uncomfortable. At Minnesota now, though, he’s one of the country’s premier bucket-getters, averaging 22.8 points per game on 53/42/82 splits. The Gophers haven’t been very good, but Tyson is absolutely sniping now that he’s playing more on the wing than on the block — and it’s allowed him some space to get to the rim and score at all three levels, too. He’s still not defending very well, but it’s a lot more forgivable when you’re averaging the second-most points per game in the nation.\n\nVen-Allen Lubin, playing basically down the street for N.C. State for a coach who talked a big game about how underutilized he was in Chapel Hill, has indeed scaled up his production with more minutes. Shooting the same efficient 69% from the floor that he did last year, he’s averaging a healthy 13.2 points and 6.8 rebounds in about 26 minutes per game. He’s having a good season individually, but with him starting at center, his team has had issues protecting the rim and dealing with size in the frontcourt. Sound familiar?\n\nJalen Washington, like Cadeau, is playing for a team that’s currently undefeated: in his case, it’s #11 Vanderbilt. He’s in the rotation at center and giving the Commodores some good minutes, averaging 9.3 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks in 19 minutes per game. He’s been a more willing shooter, with about a third of his field goal attempts coming from distance, and even though he’s shooting under 30%, just the fact that he’s not being tentative about letting it fly has helped both his team’s spacing and his own ability to work in space and finish around the rim without needing to be overly physical. The big turnaround in his game has been that he’s cut his turnover rate in half, and that’s obviously made him a lot more valuable as an offensive piece.\n\nFun fact: he’s now teammates again with Tyler Nickel, who was in his recruiting class at UNC. Nickel is having an absurdly efficient scoring season, averaging 15.3 points per game including a 48% mark from outside the arc. He recently put up 26 points on 12 shots in a win against Wake Forest.\n\nAnd finally, on the women’s side, Trayanna Crisp is starting at guard for 12-1 Mississippi State and averaging about 8 points a game on decent efficiency, including a 40% mark from 3-point range after being a 30% shooter her first three years of college. She’s become a better passer as well, and overall looks like much more of a winning player than she did in Chapel Hill.",

The former UFC bantamweight champion has been seen training as of late, but Dana White said he doesn't know what her plans are.\n\nOlivi spoke about her history with Rousey (12-2 MMA, 6-2 UFC) and how the UFC superstar played a pivotal role in her growth as a reporter.\n\n\"You know what, I don't know – and Ronda was my girl,\" Olivi told MMA Junkie. \"We worked together so much when she was in the organization. I feel a debt of gratitude to her because if she didn't allow me the space to have all those interviews with her, I don't know if my career would have evolved in the same manner in which it did. So I hope that if Ronda wants to have a fight that she has whatever fight she wants and does it to the best of her abilities.\n\n\"She just had two kids and it was like, 'I want to remind myself that I'm a badass,' that that's what she's doing, as well. I fully support it. But I think the Ronda narrative, the Gina Carano narrative, everybody's getting back in the gym and they're throwing us these little crumbs, like what is going on? But no matter what it is, these are women that have paved the road for so many – in the octagon, but also in the sports world in general. So whatever they want to do, I fully support it.\"\n\nRousey, 38, hasn't competed since a 48-second knockout loss to Amanda Nunes in December 2016.\n\nTo hear more from Olivi, check out her complete appearance on \"The Bohnfire\" podcast with MMA Junkie senior reporter Mike Bohn above.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Megan Olivi credits Ronda Rousey for helping progress career",

    "fullText": "Going at Julian Champagnie, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander bumped off him and swished in the mid-range jumper at the inside of the nail. Going back and forth, the reigning MVP was ready for this game to come down to the final moments. Sadly, the rest of his team wasn't.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander finished with 33 points on 14-of-22 shooting, eight assists and three rebounds. He shot 1-of-4 from 3 and went 4-of-5 on free throws.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder had their worst showing of the season in a 130-110 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. The same mistakes popped up on both sides of the floor.\n\nYou can tell this was a game Gilgeous-Alexander looked forward to. And like usual, he did his part to come away with the win. The Spurs couldn't contain him. The mid-range maestro went to work. He went to his spots at the baseline, in the nail and at the elbow to bury jumpers.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander drove to the basket and had circus finishes — even with Victor Wembanyama roaming the paint. That's how special a finisher he is. He shook through traffic and finessed his way to several impossible layups. Anytime the Thunder needed a bucket, he stepped up.\n\nAlas, you can't win basketball games one-on-five. Gilgeous-Alexander learned that lesson here. He was the best player on the floor, but the next four were on San Antonio's side. Those types of odds are impractical to overcome — even if you're one of the greatest players ever.\n\nTrying to keep it within a single-digit deficit, Gilgeous-Alexander made the start of the fourth quarter interesting. Eventually, though, the Spurs were able to hit big-time shots down the stretch. The rest of the Thunder couldn't. That turned this game into a surprising blowout loss. The first of the season for OKC.\n\n\"Especially in the second half, they really played the game on their terms on both ends of the floor. They got whatever offensively and defensively, we were stagnant. Had us playing over top of them for the most part,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"When you play against the good teams, you can't play like that for a long period of time because it'll chip away at itself and the next thing you look up and they have a big lead. You need to be an enforcer on at least one end of the floor and we weren't on either end of the floor. That's why it got ugly.\"\n\nThe Thunder will get a chance to wash away this nasty feeling on Christmas. They will host the Spurs in front of a national audience. At home, they're a win machine. While that game counts the same as this one in the standings, there's a little bit more pizzazz involved in that matchup due to all of the attention it receives.\n\n\"It'll be fun. Playing on Christmas Day in itself is a dream come true. I watched the NBA games growing up every single Christmas, so that'll be super fun. I can't wait to experience,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"And against a really good basketball team. It'll be a lot of fun.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander says OKC weren't 'enforcer' in loss to Spurs",

    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders will be without quarterbacks Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota when they face the Dallas Cowboys on Christmas Day. Head coach Dan Quinn announced that Mariota would miss Thursday's game and veteran Josh Johnson would start in his place.\n\nRecently re-signed Jeff Driskel will serve as Johnson's backup, while the Commanders are signing Sam Hartman to the 53-man roster as the team's emergency No. 3 quarterback.\n\nThe Commanders shut down Daniels for the remainder of the season last week after he'd reinjured his non-throwing elbow in a Week 14 loss at Minnesota. Mariota injured his throwing hand and quad in last week's loss against the Eagles. Quinn said the swelling in Mariota's right hand, combined with the short week, made it difficult for Mariota to play against the Cowboys.\n\nEarlier this week, Washington placed rookie wide receiver Jaylin Lane and defensive tackle Eddie Goldman on injured reserve. Lane, who is the Commanders' punt returner, suffered an ankle injury last week.\n\nMore bad news for Washington: defensive tackle Daron Payne and left tackle Laremy Tunsil are out on Christmas Day. Payne and Goldman's absences leave the Commanders thin at defensive tackle. Washington claimed veteran Shy Tuttle off waivers this week. Brandon Coleman will step in for Tunsil at left tackle. Linebacker Nick Bellore, Washington's special teams ace, is also out.\n\nThe 4-11 Commanders host the Cowboys for Thursday's Christmas Day game, which kicks off at 1:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Tunsil, Mariota, Payne all out vs. Cowboys",

    "description": "While the Yankees have made a series of relatively minor re-signings, teams within the AL East have added strength.",
    "fullText": "Beyond some recycled gifts, the Yankees moved into the holidays without delivering any big presents to their eager fan base.\n\nAnd outside of wanting to reunite with free agent Cody Bellinger, who is a fit for several contenders, the Yankees’ winter plan has been to marginally upgrade areas of need without spending a great deal.\n\nThat syncs with owner Hal Steinbrenner’s “ideal’’ of a payroll below the final luxury tax threshold, and GM Brian Cashman’s thoughts about the current club.\n\n“Don’t misinterpret that as saying I don’t recognize that there’s areas of weakness on this roster that we have to improve upon,\" Cashman said earlier this month. “It’s just not as prevalent as last year where we really had to do a lot of different things on the run.\n\nTrent Grisham, CF: Accepted the one-year, $22.025 million free agent qualifying offer extended by the Yankees.\n\nTim Hill, LHP: Setup reliever had his $3 million option for 2026 triggered by the team.\n\nAmed Rosario, IF: Signed to a guaranteed, one-year, $2.5 million free agent contract.\n\nPaul Blackburn, RHP: Agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract that could earn him another $500,000 in performance bonuses, as first reported by the New York Post.\n\nRyan Yarbrough, LHP: Returned on a one-year, $2.5 million free agent contract in mid-November.\n\nAn expensive runback with Grisham at least provides cover in center field if Bellinger signs elsewhere.\n\nThat leaves Jasson Dominguez as the leading left field candidate and puts lefty-slugging prospect Spencer Jones in play for a potentially significant role in 2026.\n\nRosario provides a righty-hitting platoon for third baseman Ryan McMahon, but the Yanks still seek a right-handed hitting outfield presence.\n\nYarbrough and Blackburn bolster a staff that needs flexible, veteran starting options that can collapse into relief roles once the rehabbing Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodon and Clarke Schmidt return.\n\nCade Winquest, RHP: Hard-throwing reliever became the Yankees' first Rule 5 selection in 14 years, drafted off the St. Louis Cardinals' Class AA roster.\n\nZack Short, IF: Journeyman big-league infielder (Tigers, Mets, Red Sox, Braves, Astros) signed a minor league deal. Appeared in 22 games last year with Houston.\n\nAli Sanchez, C: Part-time, right-handed hitting MLB catcher since 2020 appeared in a combined12 games last season with the Blue Jays and Red Sox.\n\nYerry Rodriguez, RHP: Reliever is rehabbing from Tommy John surgery in early 2025. Has 30 games of MLB experience (2022-24) with the Rangers and Blue Jays.\n\nWinquest is an intriguing addition, giving a window to the Yanks' current financial restraint, too. Meanwhile, it's a seller's market for right-handed hitters.\n\nThis week, the Yanks watched lefty-mashing outfielder Rob Refsnyder - who could have fit a pinstriped need - agree on a one-year, $6.25 million free agent contact with the Seattle Mariners.\n\nDevin Williams, RHP: Right-handed reliever signed a three-year, $51 million free agent deal to now replace Edwin Diaz (free agent, signed with Dodgers) as the Mets' closer.\n\nLuke Weaver, RHP: Setup reliever followed Williams to the Mets on a two-year, $22 million free agent deal.\n\nAllan Winans, RHP: Obtained release waivers in order to sign with Japan's Seibu Lions.\n\nIan Hamilton, Mark Leiter Jr., Scott Effross, Jake Cousins, RHPs: All four relievers were non-tendered, making them free agents. Hamilton (Braves) and Leiter Jr. (Athletics) have since signed with other clubs.\n\nAcquiring relievers with team control at last summer's trade deadline (David Bednar, Camilo Doval, Jake Bird) made the Yanks less desperate but still in search of another veteran setup arm.\n\nOn the trade front, they've been among the teams linked to interest in St. Louis Cardinals lefty reliever JoJo Romero, who is entering his free agent walk year.\n\nCody Bellinger, OF: In addition to the Yankees, he's linked to interest by the Mets, Blue Jays, Dodgers, Giants and Angels.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt, 1B: Compiled a .981 OPS versus left-handed pitching in 2025 and expressed a desire to play in 2026 at age 38.\n\nAustin Slater, OF: Played a very limited bench role and was injured (hamstring) after being acquired at last summer's MLB trade deadline.\n\nJonathan Loaisiga, RHP: Yankees rejected a $5 million club option on the talented, injury prone setup reliever.\n\nShould we be surprised if Bellinger’s free agency lingers well into January?\n\nKyle Tucker’s free agent market hasn’t been defined, which impacts Bellinger (an obvious target for contenders still seeking an impact, lefty-hitting outfielder).\n\nAt the Winter Meetings, Cashman said that Bellinger’s slow pace won’t prevent them from making other moves as needed, though the Yanks’ transactions have since been relatively minor.\n\nToronto Blue Jays: Signed RH free agent starters Dylan Cease (7 years, $210 million) and Cody Ponce (3 years, $30 million) and RH reliever Tyler Rogers (3 years, $37 million).\n\nBoston Red Sox: Added RH starters Sonny Gray (Cardinals), Johan Oviedo (Pirates) and 1B-DH Willson Contreras (Cardinals) via trade.\n\nBaltimore Orioles: Signed free agent 1B Pete Alonso (5 years, $155 million), free agent closer Ryan Helsley (2 years, $28 million). Added RH starter Shane Baz (Rays), OF Taylor Ward (Angels) via trade.\n\nTampa Bay Rays: Signed free agent LHP Steven Matz (2 years, $15 million) and OF Cedric Mullins (1 year, $7.5 million). Added OF Jacob Melton (Astros) and RHPs Anderson Brito (Astros) and Yoendrys Gomez (White Sox) via trade.\n\nThe defending AL champion Blue Jays' quick strike to sign Cease and the O's aggressive signing of Alonso have been highlights of MLB's offseason.\n\nBoston and Toronto are top contenders in the bidding for free agent righty hitters Alex Bregman and Bo Bichette, which would only further strengthen the league's best division.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: What are Yankees doing?

    "fullText": "The NFL and the Detroit Lions are continuing to investigate the situation involving a fan and Pittsburgh Steelers receiver DK Metcalf that happened during Sunday's game at Ford Field.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the league is interested in pursuing the matter following information provided to them by Metcalf during Tuesday's appeal hearing for his two-game suspension. The investigation will focus on if the fan violated the Lions' guest code of conduct.\n\nHere is the Lions fan code of conduct. The team found no violation and does not plan to action against the fan, who identified himself to the @freep as Ryan Kennedy. But the NFL is now following up with the team after hearing from DK Metcalf and others in his appeal hearing. pic.twitter.com/H4nyqbLX1K\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 24, 2025\n\n“The matter remains under review,” an NFL spokesman told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review in an email.\n\nMetcalf's two-game suspension was upheld, the league announced Tuesday evening, ending his regular season.\n\nThe incident occurred in the second quarter of Sunday's game. While the Lions' offense was on the field, Metcalf approached a fan sitting in the front row and wearing a blue wig. After exchanging words with the fan, Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at the fan's head.\n\nWhile the incident was captured on the broadcast, it was not seen by officials.\n\nDK Metcalf appears to have an altercation with a Detroit fan pic.twitter.com/a478Zjg3tR\n\n— NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) December 21, 2025\n\nBecause of that, Metcalf was not penalized and was not ejected from the contest.\n\nThe fan claimed Metcalf threw a punch because the fan taunted the wideout with his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius.\n\nOn Monday, however, sources told Tom Pelissero of NFL Network that the fan used a derogatory term when taunting Metcalf about his mother. That source also claimed the fan called Metcalf \"something we both know you don't call a Black man.\"\n\nThe fan's attorney released a statement Monday calling the allegations against the fan, Ryan Kennedy, \"completely false.\"\n\n\"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the 'N-word,' the 'C-word,' or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game.\n\n\"These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nDuring his Tuesday news conference, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said that although he doesn't condone Metcalf's actions, he supports the wide receiver.\n\n“He did explain to me why he did what he did, and I certainly don’t condone the behavior, but I support DK,\" Tomlin said. \"And I really don’t have a lot to add other than what I just told you.\"\n\nKennedy was escorted from his seat but not ejected from the stadium. The Lions told The Athletic on Tuesday that the team did not plan to take action against Kennedy.\n\nThe Steelers finish the regular season against the Cleveland Browns this Sunday and the Baltimore Ravens in Week 18. Pittsburgh can wrap up the AFC North title this week by beating Cleveland or with a loss by the Ravens to the Green Bay Packers.",

    "fullText": "The year 2025 was an exciting one for the LPGA, which saw the addition of a new commissioner and a number of first-time winners on tour.\n\nBefore we get to the stories clicked on the most by you, the readers, here's a look at what our LPGA beat reporter Beth Ann Nichols chose for the biggest storylines:\n\nMore: Top 10 LPGA storylines from 2025 include a major finish for the ages\n\nNow, without further ado, here are the top 10 stories (from No. 1 down) as clicked on by readers of Golfweek in 2025:\n\nIn 2024, 30-year-old Talley, while competing on the LPGA, worked for the tour in a variety of media roles, from social media to podcast host. She also started working with the Western Kentucky University women’s golf team and took a few juniors under her wing.\n\nAnd then, while her husband Patrick Smith was caddying in Asia, she found out she was pregnant, calling him at 4 a.m. to share the happy news. Smith choked on his dinner to the point his companions almost had to do the Heimlich. The incident was coincidental, Talley said, but it makes for a better story that he was worked up with excitement about the idea of becoming a dad.\n\nTalley, the pride of Princeton, Kentucky, was the last player in a long list to announce that 2024 would be her final season on the LPGA.\n\nThe Fir Hills Seri Pak Championship was dropped from the LPGA’s spring schedule. The event, slated for March 20-23, was set to be held at Palos Verdes Golf Club and feature a $2 million purse.\n\nAn LPGA statement said that \"canceling the event on its current date was unavoidable due to the event underwriter failing to fulfill any portion of its payment obligations to the LPGA Tour for the 2024 and 2025 events.\"\n\nLydia Ko traveled straight from the year's first major in Texas to a U.S. Women's Open qualifying event in San Francisco to help out a friend. The world No. 3 caddied at The Olympic Club for fellow major champion Danielle Kang on the Lake Course, using her push cart for the 36-hole gig.\n\nKang and Ko have teamed up several times to compete in the LPGA's Dow Championship.\n\nThe Annika driven by Gainbridge at Pelican brought together many of the biggest stars in women's golf looking to hoist a trophy and carry momentum into next week's CME Group Tour Championship.\n\nThe stacked field included Nelly Korda, Charley Hull and Lexi Thompson, but another name garnered much of the attention in the lead-up to this event: Kai Trump. The 18-year-old amateur golfer and granddaughter of President Donald Trump made her LPGA debut on a sponsor exemption.\n\nHere's how Trump's opening day played out.\n\nJeeno Thitikul's rise to the top of the women's game didn't come after one magnificent feat, but rather many, many months of world-class consistency.\n\nThitikul rose to No. 1 in the Rolex Rankings for a second time on Aug. 4 after finishing in a share of 30th at the AIG Women's British Open. That she toppled a player in Nelly Korda, who won seven times last season, says as much about Korda's lack of firepower in recent months as it does Thitikul's solid play.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Golfweek Wrapped 2025 LPGA: Emma Talley's retirement leads way",

What’s more, the Canucks and Bruins have explored potential trade fits on a variety of players dating to the summer.\"\n\nMORE: L.A. Kings' goalie is from the North Pole\n\nThe main concern here might be whether the Bruins and Canucks can line up on the return cost.\n\n\"The biggest hurdle here might be the asking price,\" Johnston writes. \"Vancouver is seeking a meaningful return for a player who looks poised to blow past 20 goals for the first time in his career, and Boston isn’t expected to be chasing rentals at this deadline. However, these teams might be able to thread the needle if this trade comes with a contract extension for Sherwood, which is something he’d be open to.\"\n\nSherwood is in the final year of his contract, on a deal that currently has a cap hit of $1.5 million for this season.\n\nHe'll get a raise on his next deal, wherever that comes from.

    "fullText": "Christmas Eve saw Cristiano Ronaldo on the field.\n\nThe \"Robozão\" played for the first time with his Al-Nassr in the FC Champions League Two, the second tier of the Asian Champions League, this Wednesday (24).\n\nHe didn't score, but contributed with a beautiful assist in Al-Nassr's 5-1 victory over Iraq's Al-Zawraa at the King Saud University Stadium.\n\nJorge Jesus's team was already qualified for the knockout stage and confirmed a 100% success rate after six rounds in Group D.\n\nMeanwhile, Al-Zawraa advanced in second place with seven points, benefiting from the defeat of Iran's Esteghlal, who remained at five.\n\nThe 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo had been rested in the previous five games of the FC Champions League Two.\n\nBut he started against Al-Zawraa. He tried hard, but didn't score for the 955th time in his career.\n\nThe expected dominance of Al-Nassr began at 12 minutes, with Ângelo assisting Coman.\n\nWesley scored the second by capitalizing on a rebound after a corner (19').\n\nAl Amri extended the lead (29') after a pass from João Félix.\n\nAnd the Portuguese scored the fourth after his compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo delivered a beautiful overhead pass (44').\n\nCR7 didn't even return after the break, thinking about what's to come.\n\nIbrahim scored for the Iraqi team in the second half (50').\n\nBento had more work to do as Al-Nassr reduced their intensity, considering future matches.\n\nHowever, JJ's team reached the fifth goal thanks to Coman (56').\n\nReal Madrid - 450 goals in 438 games\n\nManchester United - 145 goals in 346 games\n\nPortugal - 143 goals in 226 games\n\nAl-Nassr - 110 goals in 124 games\n\nJuventus - 101 goals in 134 games\n\nTotal: 954 goals in 1,299 games\n\nCR7 will have two more chances this year to close in on his thousandth goal. Both in Saudi Pro League matches.\n\nOn Saturday (27), the challenge will be against Al-Akhdoud again at home. Then on Tuesday (30), they will face Al-Ettifaq as visitors.\n\nAl-Nassr leads the Saudi League with a 100% success rate after nine rounds.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Defensive coordinator has been in Las Vegas since 2022",
    "fullText": "There has been incredible turnover for the Las Vegas Raiders’ coaching staff in recent years.\n\nPatrick Graham, however, has been a constant.\n\nGraham has been the Raiders’ defensive coordinator since 2022 when he joined new head coach Josh McDaniels’ staff as a highly-touted hire. Graham was then retained by new head coach Antonio Pierce in 2024 and new head coach Pete Carroll in 2025. It’s pretty rare in the league for a high-level assistant coach to be retained by two additional head coaches.\n\nNow, frankly, though, it’s time for Graham to leave the Raiders.\n\nMany in the NFL are assuming the team will walk away from Carroll one this disastrous one season with the club. If so, whoever the new coach is, needs to find his own defensive coordinator. It’s just time. It wouldn’t make much sense for the team or for Raiders to run it back for a fourth tenure\n\nIf the Raiders’ reset, they need to do it in all forms of the coaching staff. A new system, direction and voice are needed at all the key spots. Graham is a solid coach and he has done some good things with the Raiders, but his time should be up if Carroll leaves.\n\nFrankly, if somehow the Raiders do keep Carroll, it doesn’t mean Graham will stay. Carroll’s first season with the Raiders has featured him scapegoating assistants. He has already fired special teams coach Tom McMahon and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. It wouldn’t be a shock to see Carroll dump the last remaining coordinator in the offseason if he is retained in an attempt to show some sort of offseason change.\n\nIn the end, it is probably best for Graham for him to leave as well. Everyone ends a fresh start. When he came to Las Vegas Graham was considered be a top head-coaching candidate and he has received some interviews in recent head-coaching hiring cycles. But his career is stalling in Las Vegas.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nSo, there is no reason for him to return. Do you agree or disagree about Graham’s future with the team?",

    "fullText": "Former Lazio midfielder Luis Alberto believes the Biancocelesti are showing clear signs of improvement under Maurizio Sarri, despite the difficulties that have shaped their current campaign.\n\nSpeaking in a wide-ranging interview with Fanpage.it, the Spaniard admitted he was not surprised by Lazio’s struggles, suggesting internal issues were always likely to surface. However, he insisted performances have been more encouraging than results might suggest.\n\nROME, ITALY – OCTOBER 08: Matteo Guendouzi and Luis Alberto speacks during the Serie A TIM match at Stadio Olimpico on October 08, 2023 in Rome, Italy. (Photo by Marco Rosi – SS Lazio/Getty Images)\n\n“I’m not surprised,” Luis Alberto said. “I knew something like this could happen. I speak often with Cataldi, with Patric, with Mario Gila, with Pedro. I’ve also spoken to Taty. But as I always say, they can’t do much, the situation is what it is.”\n\nDespite that context, the former playmaker pointed to Lazio’s resilience in recent matches as evidence of progress. He highlighted games where Sarri’s side remained competitive even in adversity, underlining a growing mental strength within the squad.\n\nPARMA, ITALY – DECEMBER 13: Maurizio Sarri looks on prior to the Serie A match at Stadio Ennio Tardini on December 13, 2025 in Parma, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\n“I’m sure they could easily have won or drawn the match in Milan,” he continued. “Anything could have happened. I also watched them against Parma when they went down to nine men they stayed in the game and in the end they won. Overall, I think they’ve improved a lot.”\n\nLuis Alberto’s comments reflect a broader belief that Lazio’s underlying performances are stronger than their league position suggests, with Sarri’s work beginning to show despite an uneven season and off-field complications.",

    "fullText": "Complicating the picture for a long time has been the interest of Real Madrid. The Spanish capital club are known to be in the process of renewing their central defensive sector - with David Alaba and Antonio Rudiger both tipped to leave.\n\nInitially it was believed that Konate was Los Blancos’ first choice to marshal a new-look backline but the trail appears to have gone cold in the last few weeks.\n\nFirst Madrid made it known that they were not willing to pursue a deal for the France international and now comes another report suggesting that a new name is in the frame to arrive.\n\nJacobo Ramon, 20, left Madrid last summer in a deal to join Cesc Fabregas at Como in Serie A. Since then the centre-back has transformed into one of the best young defenders in the Italian top flight - leading to speculation that Madrid could bring him home.\n\nThe deal included a buy-back clause with Defensa Central now claiming that Xabi Alonso’s side intend to utilise that clause.\n\n“Jacobo Ramón's outstanding season, coupled with the fact that none of the remaining free agents have fully convinced the club, makes the academy graduate the favorite to return to Real Madrid should the club ultimately decide to sign a new center-back,” the report reads.\n\nWe can take this as an incredible Konate boost - with Liverpool now having the opportunity to conduct a new contract without the distraction of Real Madrid in the background.\n\nThe Anfield club will still need to pay attention to interest from Bayern Munich and Inter but there is certainly more hope now that Konate’s first-choice destination has been ruled out.",

On the strength of 12-3 and a consecutive successful quarterback flip, he has finally landed himself on the short list of favorites.\n\nNearly every NFL team weighed in this week about their thoughts as to who is most likely to win various awards, thanks to Tom Pelissero’s anonymous survey. 21 General Managers themselves were part of the process.\n\nOut of 30 votes gathered, 19.5 front offices around the league feel John Schneider is this year’s Executive of the Year.\n\nWho voted half? I don’t know, but Les Snead got the other half vote, so you take a guess.\n\n19.5 votes for Schneider, and second place was two.

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos will look to turn the page quickly on their tough loss a few days ago with a road win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. The Chiefs are down to their third string quarterback and have nothing left to play for. This is a game the Broncos should win and if they don’t, then the real questions begin.\n\nWe’re pretty confident that this won’t be the case. The Broncos should coast to victory like they did against Kansas City in the final game of last season when they were resting starters instead of being long-eliminated from contention.\n\nDenver Broncos at Kansas City ChiefsP.M. Mile High time\nGEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri\nATS Betting Lines: Denver -13.5\nMoneyline Odds: Denver -1200 / Kansas City +750\nOver/Under: 36.5\nNote: All odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nCollectively, our Mile High Report staff is predicting a Broncos 27-11 win on the road over the Chiefs. Here’s how each of us predicted things would go individually:\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe line in this game is crazy…. if only because the over/under stands at 36.5. They expect the Chiefs offense to sputter and the Broncos offense to be ho-hum. I checked the weather and that isn’t going to be a factor at all it appears. Given all that, I’ll be cheeky here and predict a backdoor cover and an under. Now I just wait for the officiating crew to make it happen! – Tim Lynch\n\nThis one isn’t difficult. The Broncos should beat the Chiefs. It shouldn’t be close. The defense will be looking to make a statement, which should mean bad things for a 3rd string QB. Bo Nix will want some redemption from the loss to Jacksonville. – Adam Malnati\n\nAfter an incredible 11-game winning streak, the Broncos finally suffered their first loss since Week 3 of the regular season. On Christmas, they will play the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Even though the Chiefs will be playing their third-string quarterback, Denver can’t underestimate their division rival. The Broncos have to play a complete game, limit the miscues and mistakes, and find a way to win. Their hopes of an AFC West title and #1 seed depend on it. Ultimately, I believe the Broncos can bounce back to get their thirteenth win of the season. – Chris Hart\n\nNix and the Broncos should win this game. As others have noted, KC is down to their third-string QB and have been eliminated from the AFC Playoffs. But crazy things happen in December at Arrowhead. So Denver can’t look passed this game or just lollygag and expect to get the win. Approach this game like a must-win game, which it is, and put the poor showing against the Jags behind everyone. Take nothing for granted, play a complete game, and make Chiefs Kingdom’s Christmas a little less enjoyable. – Ian St. Clair",

    "fullText": "On 23 December 2025, Judge Leal granted a motion brought by Vizio that sought a ruling on a position that SFC has not actually taken.\r\nVizio asked the court to rule on something that no one\r\n believes the GPLv2 requires.\n\nSpecifically, Vizio said in their\r\n motion for summary adjudication:\r\nDefendant VIZIO, Inc. [moves] this Court for summary adjudication [re] whether … GPLv2 … and … LGPLv2.1 … require the licensee [under the GPL Agreements] to\r\nprovide information necessary to install modified versions of the licensed\r\nsoftware back onto the Smart TVs with which the software was originally\r\ndistributed while ensuring the TVs continue to function properly. …\r\nVIZIO moves on the grounds that the plain language … compels the\r\nconclusion that neither license imposes a duty on licensees to provide all\r\ninformation necessary to permit reinstallation of modified software back\r\n on the same device such that the device continues to function properly.\n\nSFC has never held the position, nor do we today hold the position, that\r\n any version of the GPL (even including GPLv3!) require “that the\r\n device continues to function properly” after a user installs their\r\n modified version of the copyleft components.\n\nIndeed, as was seen with TiVo, it is\r\n completely sufficient to provide the user a mechanism to install a new\r\n firmware that removes not only all proprietary components (such\r\n as Vizio's (or TiVo's) TV application), but also other material that is a “independent and separate work” from the copylefted software. (This may include, for example, removing keys used to\r\n decode encrypted video content with the underlying hardware.) The GPL Agreements\r\n promise the users' right to a functioning Linux-based system with any other copylefted\r\n components.\n\nUnfortunately, Vizio's motion is likely\r\n to confuse the public. No reasonable consumer or copyleft activist has ever\r\n asked for this, nor expects it. GPLv3 itself even allows (under certain conditions) for the\r\n OEM vendor to cause the accompanying user-space proprietary\r\n software to cease to function. We frankly don't know where Vizio got the language for their motion.\n\nFor years, we have asked Vizio to for the complete, corresponding source\r\n code for all GPL'd and LGPL'd components on their devices so we can keep\r\n these devices out of landfills, repurpose them for new applications,\r\n and otherwise exercise our software right to repair as consumers. We (and all consumers)\r\n have expected to happen with every piece of hardware that we all\r\n have purchased since the inception of copylefted operating systems. Vizio's position here is even what we\r\n would expect with a laptop: if we buy a Microsoft Windows laptop and\r\n install a Linux-based system, we wouldn't expect the Microsoft Word application to necessarily\r\n continue working (Microsoft's software might work with Wine, but\r\n the laptop vendor wouldn't guarantee that.) Similarly, we don't expect\r\n Vizio's proprietary TV software to function when we exercise our right to\r\n software repair.\n\nLitigation is complicated and nuanced decisions by the Court are often\r\n exaggerated by third parties with a political and/or policy agenda. We will continue to advocate, in this case and elsewhere, that users and consumers are owed the installation scripts that were used to install the GPLv2'd and LGPLv2.1'd software. We do expect those who favor corporate profit over users' rights to publicly claim this ruling reaches further and means more than it says.\n\nWe still await the judge's decision on our own motion for summary adjudication. We will continue to provide nuanced and realistic information about our best understanding of this historic case and our future work to come.\n\nWe look forward to the\r\n Vizio trial where we will argue that our (and the FSF's) interpretation of the\r\n copyleft licenses is correct, accurate, and assures the software right to\r\n repair. Join us in Santa Ana next month to watch the truth unfold.",

    "title": "A Father, a Son and Their $108B Push for Media Moguldom (Larry Ellison)",
    "description": "Larry and David Ellison didn’t always have a close relationship. Now they’re one of the most intriguing partnerships in business.",
    "fullText": "Theodore Schleifer writes about billionaires in America.\n\nWhen David Ellison became a teenager, his father, Larry, bought him a gift not usually bestowed on a 13th birthday: his own Katana stunt plane. The two had spent little meaningful time together. But with their own aircraft, the father and son could bond in the air, practicing aerobatic flips and ruling the skies together.\n\nNow, Larry Ellison is trying to help buy his son a media empire so they can rule Hollywood and news together.\n\nWhat was once a relatively weak father-and-son relationship has transformed into one of modern media’s most intriguing business partnerships. Towering behind almost every move made by David Ellison, now 42 and the chief executive of Paramount, is his swaggering 81-year-old father, the billionaire co-founder of the software giant Oracle.\n\nThe two have formed an unusual tag team in their pursuit of major media deals, according to more than two dozen people with knowledge of their interactions. They bought Paramount this summer, and now they are hunting Warner Bros. Discovery with a $108 billion hostile bid.\n\nOn Monday, David Ellison made it clearer than ever that his father is the centerpiece of this bid, telling Warner Bros. that Larry Ellison personally guaranteed $40.4 billion for Paramount’s offer. David Ellison has referred to the deal as something “we” — or “the Ellison family” — were pursuing. Both have sought to arm-twist Warner executives.\n\nFather and son speak about five times a week — sometimes about their tennis matches or their joint philanthropy at the University of Oxford. But these days, often the topic is deal-making. David Ellison consults his father at length on every deal-related decision, one person with knowledge of their interactions said.\n\nThey discuss how to navigate President Trump, whose administration must approve any major acquisition. Larry Ellison has taken the lead in making the case to the president for why Paramount and not Netflix, its rival bidder, should win control of Warner Bros., two of the people said. Mr. Trump has pledged to be “involved” in any decision about whether to approve a deal.\n\nA Silicon Valley celebrity for decades, Mr. Ellison co-founded Oracle five decades ago and turned it into a $252 billion personal fortune. He has been deferential to his son on this year’s deal talks, a person close to the process said.\n\nWhen talking about the hostile bid for Warner Bros., he has often referred to his history of hostile acquisitions during the 1990s and 2000s, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. His son, who interned at Oracle for two summers during that time, watched him work through some deals, the people said.\n\nIf the Ellisons prevail, their business empire could range from CNN to Warner Bros. to TikTok. That could have enormous consequences for the news and entertainment industries, perhaps making the Ellisons as influential as the Murdochs, whose media dynasty operates Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and other major outlets.\n\nMr. Trump has privately said Larry Ellison assured him that he would turn CBS News, which the Ellisons took over when they bought Paramount, into a more conservative outlet, two people with knowledge of the president’s comments said.\n\nOn Sunday night, a “60 Minutes” correspondent accused David Ellison’s handpicked editor in chief of CBS News, Bari Weiss, of making a “political” decision to hold a story about Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration. Ms. Weiss told colleagues on a call on Monday that she had held the segment because it “wasn’t ready.”\n\nDavid Ellison, born in 1983, was largely raised in Woodside, a town in Silicon Valley, by his father’s third wife, Barbara. She and Larry Ellison maintained a warm relationship after their divorce in 1986, several people close to the family say, but he was not a day-to-day presence in his son’s life. Oracle colleagues did not hear him talk often about David, who, when he was 23, said there had been “gaps” in their relationship growing up.\n\nIt wasn’t until the two began taking flight lessons together that they grew close. “I’m afraid I must have passed on the risk-taking gene,” Larry Ellison said about their shared daredevil interest in 2006.\n\nDavid Ellison dropped out of the University of Southern California’s film school and started an acting career. His father heavily financed his first major movie as an actor, “Flyboys,” which was widely considered a flop.\n\nLarry Ellison was relieved when his son left acting and entered the business side of entertainment, two people said. Their relationship grew warmer as David Ellison achieved professional success, they said. Larry Ellison has always considered himself wise about Hollywood, and one of his best friends, Steve Jobs, mentored the son about the business as well.\n\nLarry Ellison was initially skeptical of Skydance, the Hollywood company that his son started and that bought Paramount. But he has told friends in recent years that he considers his son to be one of the smartest people in the business world, trusts his judgment and tends to agree with him on corporate matters, several people with knowledge of the Ellisons said.\n\n“Larry is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, but I honestly think David may be even smarter,” said Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce and a mentee of Larry Ellison who said he had known David since he was 3.\n\nIn recent years, Larry Ellison has invited his close circle of friends to join his son for Saturday dinners at his beachside spread on Carbon Beach in Malibu, Calif., often followed by a movie, a person with knowledge of the activities said. And David Ellison, in turn, has sought out personal and medical advice from his father, who considers himself knowledgeable about health care. A few years ago, he called his father for help on how to handle a friend’s medical emergency during a tennis match, people with knowledge of the incident recalled.\n\nLarry Ellison mostly stayed behind the scenes at Skydance. He invested an undisclosed amount in the company as early as 2006, his son has said, and even more during a $150 million fund-raising round in 2010 that made him the largest shareholder.\n\n“He gave me an incredible opportunity by believing in me in the beginning,” David Ellison said in an interview in 2022. “I could not be more grateful for that. And we definitely talk about work constantly and work together constantly.”\n\nToday, Paramount’s board — David Ellison’s bosses — includes the head of his family office, Paul Marinelli, and Oracle’s former chief executive Safra Catz.\n\nLarry Ellison’s experiences with the press have had him, too, thinking about the news business. He was often frustrated by what he saw as sensationalized coverage about him and his personal life, several people close to him said. He only really respected publications like The Financial Times or The Economist. (Oracle often advertised on the back page of The Economist.) In more recent years, he became more antagonistic about the press.\n\nHis son appears to share some of those same feelings. He has told people privately that CBS News could improve its finances if it was perceived as less liberal. He hired Ms. Weiss, the founder of The Free Press, an upstart digital news site, and a regular critic of traditional news organizations, to lead CBS News.\n\nThose criticisms of CBS News also line up with those lodged by Mr. Trump, who has forged a close relationship with Larry Ellison. Mr. Ellison was once a stalwart Clinton-era Democrat, but he has gravitated toward Mr. Trump in large part because of the president’s support for Israel, several people who have spoken to him said. (Both Ellisons are close to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, who one associate described as like an uncle figure to David Ellison.)\n\nDavid Ellison is still leaning hard on his father to help him with Mr. Trump, who could spoil his father’s generosity.\n\nMr. Trump and Larry Ellison speak frequently, people close to Mr. Trump and Mr. Ellison’s operations said. Mr. Ellison has been frustrated at times this year by Mr. Trump’s trade policies, but in recent conversations with the president he has been obsequious, one of the people said.\n\nA White House official said Mr. Trump’s conversations with Mr. Ellison were being mischaracterized. The official declined to be named or elaborate.\n\nThe Paramount deal team only occasionally discusses how to take advantage of the relationship with Mr. Trump, according to a person close to Larry Ellison. But Larry spoke to the president about Warner Bros. Discovery after Netflix announced its deal to buy the company, according to a White House official and a person close to Mr. Trump.\n\nSo far, though, the efforts by the father and son do not necessarily seem to be having the desired effect.\n\n“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called “takeover,” than they have ever treated me before,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media last week. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\nTyler Pager contributed reporting.",

    "description": "Leading physicist Saul Perlmutter warns AI can create a false sense of confidence, urging skepticism and constant error-checking.",
    "fullText": "Probably not, according to Saul Perlmutter, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who was credited for discovering that the universe's expansion is accelerating.\n\nHe said AI's biggest danger is psychological: it can give people the illusion they understand something when they don't, weakening judgment just as the technology becomes more embedded in our daily work and learning.\n\n\"The tricky thing about AI is that it can give the impression that you've actually learned the basics before you really have,\" Perlmutter said on a podcast episode with Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Group, on Wednesday.\n\n\"There's a little danger that students may find themselves just relying on it a little bit too soon before they know how to do the intellectual work themselves,\" he added.\n\nRather than rejecting AI outright, Perlmutter said the answer is to treat it as a tool — one that supports thinking instead of doing it for you.\n\nPerlmutter said that AI can be powerful — but only if users already know how to think critically.\n\n\"The positive is that when you know all these different tools and approaches to how to think about a problem, AI can often help you find the bit of information that you need,\" he said.\n\nAt UC Berkeley, where Perlmutter teaches, he and his colleagues developed a critical-thinking course centered on scientific reasoning, including probabilistic thinking, error-checking, skepticism, and structured disagreement, taught through games, exercises, and discussion designed to make those habits automatic in everyday decisions.\n\n\"I'm asking the students to think very hard about how would you use AI to make it easier to actually operationalize this concept — to really use it in your day-to-day life,\" he said.\n\nOne of Perlmutter's concerns is that AI often speaks with far more certainty than it deserves and can be \"overly confident\" in what it says.\n\nThe challenge, Perlmutter said, is that AI's confident tone can short-circuit skepticism, making people more likely to accept its answers at face value rather than question whether they're correct.\n\nThat confidence, he said, mirrors one of the most dangerous human cognitive biases: trusting information that appears authoritative or confirms our existing beliefs.\n\nTo counter that instinct, Perlmutter said people should evaluate AI outputs the same way they would any human claim — weighing credibility, uncertainty, and the possibility of error rather than accepting answers at face value.\n\nIn science, Perlmutter said, researchers assume they are making mistakes and build systems to catch them. For example, scientists hide their results from themselves, he said, until they've exhaustively checked for errors, thereby reducing confirmation bias.\n\nThe same mindset applies to AI, he added.\n\n\"Many of [these concepts] are just tools for thinking about where are we getting fooled,\" he said. \"We can be fooling ourselves, the AI could be fooling itself, and then could fool us.\"\n\nThat's why AI literacy also involves knowing when not to trust the output, he said — and being comfortable with uncertainty, rather than treating AI outputs as absolute truth.\n\nStill, Perlmutter is clear that this isn't a problem with a permanent solution.\n\n\"AI will be changing,\" he said, \"and we'll have to keep asking ourselves: is it helping us, or are we getting fooled more often? Are we letting ourselves get fooled?\"",

    "description": "Cutting dessert out of your diet could backfire, making it harder eat healthy long-term. A dietitian explains how to enjoy food for better weight loss.",
    "fullText": "A little treat could be your secret weapon to successful weight loss, according to nutrition science.\n\nThat's because an \"all or nothing\" approach of cutting out everything you love to eat can set you up to fail long-term, said Tara Schmidt, lead dietitian for the Mayo Clinic diet.\n\n\"There's really no wiggle room. People get trapped,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nInstead, think of healthy eating as a lifestyle, one that leaves room for a scoop of ice cream or occasional pizza.\n\nResearch supports having a little treat, too. A recent study on dieters found that people had fewer cravings, lost more weight, and maintained their weight loss better if they included favorite foods instead of abstaining. Portion sizes matter — researchers found small servings of delicious foods made it easier to avoid a cycle of restriction and overindulgence.\n\nSchmidt, who wasn't involved in the study, said she's been giving the same advice to her clients for years, explaining that a flexible diet is better for weight loss in the long-run.\n\n\"Allowing for a balanced way of including your favorite foods, a planned indulgence, really helps people feel less deprived,\" Schmidt said.\n\nThe cardinal rule of weight loss is that to shed fat, you need to be in a calorie deficit, eating fewer calories than you burn off.\n\nSchmidt said many eating plans can get you into a calorie deficit, at least for a while. For long-term results, some diets are better than others.\n\n\"If you can't keep doing what you did to lose the weight, it's not going to stay off,\" she said.\n\nThat's why completely cutting out your favorite foods, dessert, or other craveable treats can backfire, unless you're really willing to give them up forever.\n\nIntentionally making room for treats can also make it easier to enjoy them more mindfully. For instance, 31-year-old Jared Wakeford told Business Insider he burned more body fat when he started allowing himself carbs, instead of eating heaps of protein but sneaking in croissants when life got stressful.\n\n\"I'm a man who loves a pastry,\" he said. \"Now I save the times that I have them, and my appreciation is greater.\"\n\nTreats are fun, but the rest of your diet doesn't have to be boring, either. Simple kitchen hacks can make healthy eating delicious and convenient, Schmidt said.\n\nFor instance, stock up on frozen fruits and veggies, starting with whichever you most enjoy, and find ways to jazz them up, from adding herbs and citrus to oven-roasting for more flavor.\n\n\"I don't really care if you eat cucumbers or tomatoes, I'm just happy you're eating a vegetable and you're much more likely to eat it if you like it,\" Schmidt said.\n\nAnd let's face it, no one can thrive on a diet of chicken, rice, and broccoli every day. Ditch the boring meal plan by seeking out delicious and nutritious new recipes.\n\nMost importantly, don't try to force healthy alternatives in lieu of your favorite treat. No amount of clever food prep can make a protein shake into dessert.\n\n\"Coming home after work and eating carrots, that's not giving you any dopamine,\" Schmidt said. \"If you want to have a margarita and chips and salsa, have it, but I need you to enjoy it and listen to your body and whether or not you're hungry anymore.\"",

    "description": "JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman Sachs are investing heavily in AI technology to transform operations, enhance productivity, and stay competitive.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase has a technology budget of $18 billion, with much of it going toward making sure it's a leader and early mover in AI.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is a \"tremendous\" user of the bank's generative AI suite. The bank has rolled out its proprietary genAI platform to over 200,000 employees. And with about 100 more tools in the pipeline, JPMorgan is seeking to reengineer workflows for everyone from coders to portfolio managers.\n\nJPMorgan has reportedly given employees the option to use its in-house AI tools to assist in writing year-end performance reviews.\n\nExecutives at America's largest bank gave an inside look at how it's training employees to use its tools and how they're using them to deliver measurable results.\n\nDimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race, and he thinks JPMorgan's $2 billion AI investment has already matched its cost in savings.\n\nCitigroup has also been aggressively accelerating its AI plans. Over the summer, the bank doubled down on its AI ambitions with new leadership at the helm of its tech transformation.\n\nIn mid-October, Citi CEO Jane Fraser said that nearly 180,000 employees in 83 countries have access to the bank's proprietary AI tools and have used them almost 7 million times this year.\n\nIts generative AI tools have saved 100,000 developer hours a week with automated code reviews — \"a very meaningful productivity uplift,\" she said during the firm's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe bank launched the pilot of agentic AI for 5,000 colleagues in September.\n\n\"It allows complex, multi-step tasks to be completed with a single prompt, and the early results are very promising, and we'll expand access to this in the months ahead,\" said Fraser. \"Finally, we have launched a firm-wide effort to systematically embed AI in our processes end-to-end to drive further efficiencies, reduce risk, and improve client experience.\"\n\nShe also highlighted several tools to help its wealth management advisors. Citi hired an AI leader from Morgan Stanley earlier this year to help revamp its wealth technology.\n\nLike JPMorgan, Citi is also telling employees to use AI for performance reviews, Fraser recently told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nOne of Citi's top tech executives, Shadman Zafar, outlined the bank's four-phased AI strategy and how it will \"change how we work for decades to come.\"\n\nGoldman put $6 billion behind its technology spend this year, but David Solomon, the bank's CEO, said he wished it were more.\n\nHe said he would like to be at least $8 billion, but \"I can't afford it because I've got to deliver returns,\" he said at a conference in early October.\n\nA definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came from a memo to employees in October announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS. The memo said the plan would leverage AI will drive efficiency at the firm, slow hiring, and result in a \"limited reduction\" of roles.\n\nGoldman, like its peers, has been rolling out tools, including an internal AI assistant to all employees this summer.\n\nBusiness Insider talked to employees about how they were using AI.\n\nGoldman's top partners and Solomon are eager to see AI rev up their businesses. From realizing internal productivity gains to capturing more business as clients look to raise money in anticipation of AI development and acquisitions, here's what the top echelon is expecting.\n\nThere is no AI without data, and there is no data strategy at Goldman without its chief data officer, Neema Raphael. Raphael gave Business Insider an inside look at how his roughly 500-person team melds with the rest of the bank to get the most out of its data.\n\nMorgan Stanley's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, lifted the curtain on some of the firm's progress on AI during its earnings call last month.\n\nShe highlighted DevGen.AI, a tool that, from January to June, Business Insider previously reported, had saved developers more than 280,000 hours, or 11,666 days they would have previously dedicated to deciphering outdated code.\n\nParable, an interactive tool that analyzes and summarizes data, and LeadIQ, an AI-powered lead distribution platform that matches users of its workplace and self-directed platforms to the bank's financial advisors, were also spotlighted in the call.\n\nA survey of Morgan Stanley's interns also gave a peek into just how popular and useful AI has been for the industry's youngest cohort. ChatGPT is their favorite tool by far — with 72% of Morgan Stanley's interns said they use it daily or several times a week. The bank was early to have a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nMorgan Stanley also spoke with Business Insider about bringing employees' AI ideas to life. Here's a look at that process.\n\nBank of America's AI rollout is also well underway.\n\nThe bank's CEO Brian Moynihan says its use of AI is already embedded across the firm, from consumer banking to institutional clients. Its virtual assistant, Erica, handled 2 million customer interactions in a single day and can now answer 700 types of questions — up from 210 a year ago. Executives said they'll share more details on the bank's AI strategy at its investor day on November 5.\n\nRob Pascal, the bank's chief experience officer, previously detailed how the bank's internal-facing AI assistant helps bankers collect, record, and review client data.",

    "title": "Taiwan is getting plenty of missiles and drones from the US. A top business leader says the arsenal is out of balance.",
    "description": "Recent US weapons packages to Taiwan have largely been asymmetric capabilities, but Taiwan needs more advanced systems as well, an official said.",
    "fullText": "The US has sent Taiwan a growing number of asymmetric weapons intended to help deter and defeat a potential Chinese invasion.\n\nTaiwan needs a more balanced arsenal of systems to counter other conflict scenarios, such as a sustained blockade, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council recently argued.\n\nAsymmetric warfare, which relies on large numbers of relatively inexpensive, mobile, and difficult-to-target systems like drones, missiles, and dispersed units, offers Taiwan an advantage against the military might of China.\n\nBut more conventional capabilities, such as those needed to sustain operations, defend sea lanes, and maintain air and missile defense over time, are still necessary should China attempt to blockade the island. In recent years, US military support has skewed away from those needs.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, Rupert Hammond-Chambers, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council, described the state of US military aid to Taiwan as out of balance.\n\nHammond-Chambers said that US arms sales have \"swung from one extreme\" — the weapons deals years ago for MQ-9 Reaper drones, M1A2 Abrams tanks, and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets — \"to the other extreme where we're only doing asymmetric,\" a shift he warned leaves potential vulnerabilities.\n\nOver the last five years, the US has sold and delivered large quantities of missiles, drones, command-and-control upgrades, ammunition, software, and spare parts, marking a shift away from the higher-profile platforms like tanks and fighter jets.\n\nUS officials have argued that survivable, distributed, and networked systems are better suited to helping Taiwan counter China's daily gray-zone pressure, as well as complicating Beijing's plans in a crisis or blockade.\n\nTaiwan's focus has been on building a network of asymmetric capabilities to deter and defend against a full-scale invasion, what some have referred to as a \"D-Day scenario.\"\n\nHammond-Chambers said military support and sales have been aligned with countering that, \"but we are not doing every day, and there needs to be a swing back and more of a balance.\"\n\nJust this month, the US announced a massive $11 billion arms sale to Taiwan that included High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones. Many of those systems are designed to be mobile, dispersed, and survivable, reinforcing Washington's emphasis on asymmetric and precision-strike capabilities.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the US \"continues to assist Taiwan in maintaining sufficient self-defense capabilities and in rapidly building strong deterrent power and leveraging asymmetric warfare advantages, which form the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability.\"\n\nTaiwan's government has also proposed billions of dollars in supplemental funding for asymmetric capabilities and an island-wide air defense system called Taiwan Dome or T-Dome.\n\nTaiwan's domestic investment in these weapons raises a key question: \"Will American security assistance adjust given that Taiwan is putting an enormous amount of money further down for this so-called asymmetric approach and allow for consideration of other platforms and systems?\" Hammond-Chambers said.\n\nOne of the most complicated challenges facing Taiwan is how it can develop and stockpile its own weapons systems should a blockade prevent assistance from the US and other allies and partners. The simple answer, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said at the event, is to make weapons at scale on the island, rather than relying primarily on co-production or foreign supply.\n\nExperts and officials have long pointed to the need for a stronger local defense supply chain, including spare parts, munitions, and sustainment capabilities, so that Taiwan can remain operational if outside support is delayed or disrupted.\n\nWhile Taiwan's domestic defense industry can continue to develop its own weapons, \"the fastest way to production is to license American and Ukrainian and European designs and to produce on island,\" Betsy Shieh, former senior commercial officer with the US Department of Commerce, said at the event.\n\nThat approach, while not without political and logistical hurdles, could allow Taiwan to scale production more quickly. Taiwanese companies will learn to innovate as that goes on, she said, \"but the short term is license, license, license, build on island.\"\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially, and it continues to assess what types of weapons and capabilities are most needed for the different ways China could attempt to seize the island.\n\nAt this moment, some of its domestic companies have been going all-in on drone production, and a government-created national drone team is focused on bringing together firms from across Taiwan's industrial base to help build those systems at scale, but more engagement may be necessary to realize its potential.",

I wondered if he had rejected his father, me, and our traditions.\n\nWhen my son moved back home after graduating last spring, we welcomed this bonus time with him as we readjusted to sharing a house again.\n\nGone was the gangly teen who left home at age 18, replaced by a young man focused on his new career. It struck me as surreal that we could chat about work like peers over the dinner table, then seconds later, I'd be nagging him to hang up his towel from the bathroom floor.\n\nIt felt like I had my son back, but something had changed.\n\nWhile our family had always attended church, finding support and meaning there, my son had not been enthusiastic about going, especially as a teenager. He never wanted to attend the youth group, saying he didn't click with the other kids. Later, when we dropped him off at college armed with a list of local churches and student fellowship groups to check out, he didn't speak of them.\n\nHe seemed to wander away from his faith for a while, or at least let it simmer in the background.\n\nThat changed when he moved home after college. He started coming to church with us again. It felt like another way my son came back to me. But after checking out the Catholic church in town, he started attending mass there regularly.\n\nI saw that my son was taking his faith journey more seriously, and it made me quietly pleased. Still, it continued to bother me that he was no longer attending the same church as my husband and me.\n\n\"Where's the big guy?\" our pastor inquired about our son a couple of months ago.\n\nWhen I shared the news that my son was attending the Catholic church in town, our pastor nodded thoughtfully. I followed this up with the happy news that my son had proposed to his girlfriend and they were now engaged. When I mentioned his fiancée was Catholic, our pastor broke into a smile.\n\nHe expressed genuine support for my son attending a different church, emphasizing how important it was for our son to pursue a deeper relationship with God at the same place his fiancée worshiped. It would only make him a better husband, he concluded.\n\nI felt a range of emotions: surprise, relief, and happiness. My pastor flipped my perspective, and rightly so. I realized my son wasn't rejecting us; rather, he was pursuing his independence and preparing for a life with his fiancée.\n\nHe wasn't walking away from us, but using the seeds his dad and I may have planted all those years we took him to church to grow his faith along a path that belonged to him.\n\nMy son and his fiancée are planning their wedding for later next year. They'll marry in a Catholic church, and I will be blessed to watch them commit to each other there. I'm grateful he found his faith again, and that what once felt like him drifting away was really him growing toward his own adult faith and future.",

    "description": "Ukraine uses ground robots to fire at Russian targets and attack positions while its own soldiers stay at a safer distance.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's military has approved a ground robot adapted for some of the country's most vital grenade launchers, the robot's manufacturer said.\n\nThe autonomous vehicles, also called ground drones or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), are playing a growing role in Ukraine, helping its military with one of its biggest disadvantages: its much smaller military.\n\nThe robots are used for a host of functions, including firing at Russian targets, blowing up Russian positions, and evacuating the wounded.\n\nBut the company, DevDroid, said this was the first time Ukraine has given this level of authorization to one adapted for these key launchers.\n\nIt wrote on LinkedIn this week that its Droid NW 40 \"is the first codified reconnaissance and strike UGV\" that is adapted for the US-made Mk-19 40mm and the Ukrainian-made AGL-53 automatic grenade launchers.\n\nThe American-made Mk-19 has been an important weapon for NATO militaries over the past few decades. The domestically made AGL-53 was approved by Ukraine's military this year. Both are important for Ukraine as it seeks to modernize and not rely on its Soviet-designed weapons.\n\nDevDroid said the codification means the robot is \"approved for service with the Defense Forces and meets NATO standards.\"\n\nIt said the system is designed to attack personnel and light armored vehicles at a range of 0.9 miles, with remote controls allowing operators to stay back.\n\nIt's not the first time that ground robots have been used to fire grenades in Ukraine. But it appears to be the first time that a design engineered to fire those key grenade launchers has had official approval for use.\n\nUkraine's Ministry of Defense could not be reached for immediate comment.\n\nA Ukrainian unit has shared images of a ground robot equipped with a different grenade launcher, and Oleksandr Yabchanka, the head of the robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that his unit has \"brilliant\" turrets that attach the MK-19 grenade launcher to some of its ground robots.\n\nHe said robots can be fitted with different weapons, like machine guns or grenade launchers, to fire at Russian positions. It means they can attack while keeping Ukrainian soldiers safer, as Russia is likely to return fire to wherever the attack comes from, and can also drive closer to Russian positions to launch the attacks.\n\nHe said ground robot systems are best when they work like Lego, with soldiers able to put the same system together in different ways to perform different functions, rather than having many different systems to use.\n\nUkrainian soldiers are constantly learning new ways to use existing weaponry and encouraging the development of new types. It means innovation can also happen before any official defense ministry involvement.\n\nThe war has been marked by constant innovation, with both large and small defense companies continually developing new types of technology, particularly in the areas of robotics and drones. This includes on the battlefield, where soldiers stay in communication with manufacturers to give feedback and get fast upgrades.\n\nThe way soldiers use some robotic systems has even come as a surprise to the manufacturers themselves, a testament to how rapidly the technology's use is developing.\n\nGround robots account for a tiny portion of Ukraine's drone use. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said this month that in November, they accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nAnd it is unclear how widely the Droid NW 40 will be used or how many can be manufactured.\n\nBut dozens of companies are working on the newer and growing tech in Ukraine, where its population is so much smaller than Russia's that it needs systems to allow it to fight without much manpower.\n\nDevDroid itself says that its system allows \"the execution of complex combat missions from a safe distance and minimizing risks to personnel.\"\n\nAnd the robots' achievements are growing too. A Ukrainian unit said on Monday that it used a DevDroid TW 12.7 that was equipped with a .50-caliber machine gun to hold frontline positions for 45 straight days.",

    "description": "I was born in South Korea and have gone back to visit every year. Skip Seoul to see some of my favorite lesser-known cities, like Suwon and Incheon.",
    "fullText": "I was born in South Korea and moved to the United States when I was 5 years old. I've traveled back almost every year since.\n\nUsually, when people ask me for South Korean travel recommendations, what they really want are ideas for things to do in Seoul.\n\nI can understand why tourists flock to the capital city of South Korea: Seoul is a hub for incredible culture, technology, entertainment, fashion, and cuisine.\n\nHowever, if you ask me, you would be missing out if you didn't pay a visit to some of the other, lesser-known cities that contribute to the heartbeat of South Korea.\n\nHere are five of my favorite cities to visit in South Korea that aren't Seoul.\n\nAbout four hours south of Seoul lies Busan. Growing up, my family visited this city over the summer to swim in the sea, soak up the sun, and eat incredibly fresh seafood.\n\nYou don't have to treat Busan exclusively as a warm-weather getaway, though: My favorite season to visit Busan is actually in the fall, when the days are sunny and the nights are breezy with sea-salt air.\n\nMy favorite destination in Busan is Gamcheon Culture Village, a steep slope dotted with hundreds of colorfully painted homes.\n\nDuring the Korean War, this area was created as a settlement for refugees. Gamcheon was later restored and enhanced with brightly colored exterior paint to attract tourism.\n\nToday, Gamcheon Village stands as a beloved landmark in Busan, where visitors can get lost in the twisted alleyways and enjoy stunning views overlooking the hilly scenery.\n\nI strongly recommend that anyone who visits Busan dedicate one morning to waking up early and watching the sunrise over Haeundae Beach.\n\nIn my opinion, the view alone can wash away any negative feelings, even for a brief moment.\n\nWhen you're in Busan, don't forget to check out the Jagalchi Market for excellent fish and the Nampo-dong Food Alley for the best street food.\n\nIf you want to stay in Seoul for most of your trip but crave an easy day trip with a laid-back vibe, Suwon is your answer. Whenever I take the hourlong bus trip, excitement brews in my stomach.\n\nThe main attraction of this very chill city is the Hwaseong Fortress, a towering stone-and-brick fortress that passes through the center city of Suwon. It was built in the 18th century to protect the city and, in 1997, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nI love to walk the length of the fortress — because of the lack of high-rise buildings, this is an excellent way to take in the scenery of the city, which has a mix of traditional houses, cozy little cottages, and low-rise industrial buildings.\n\nRunning along the length of the historical site, the city has many unassuming, cute cafés where you can get delicious coffee drinks and desserts.\n\nIt's nice to sit down outside one of them and lose track of time, soaking up the beautiful street art that paints the alleyways of Suwon.\n\nOnce the capital of the ancient Silla Kingdom, Gyeongju is filled with landmarks that bring the country's deep history to life.\n\nFrom the grand Bulguksa Temple and the mystical Seokguram Grotto to the ancient royal tombs scattered throughout Tumuli Park, the city offers a rare glimpse into Korea's royal past and Buddhist origins.\n\nStrolling through Gyeongju, especially during the later hours of the day, immerses you in a peaceful blend of quiet ponds and lantern-lit walkways.\n\nYou can't leave Gyeongju without Hwangnam-ppang, a small soft pastry filled with sweet red-bean filling. This treat is a local specialty of Gyeongju — so much so that locals and visitors refer to it as Gyeongju bread.\n\nYou can find this treat at various food shops and vendors throughout the city.\n\nAnyone who flies into South Korea will instantly recognize Incheon, at least by name. It is home to the country's largest international airport.\n\nLong before the creation of the airport in 2001, though, there was the Incheon port through which goods from China arrived and were sold.\n\nThe port also paved the way for the establishment of Incheon's Chinatown, where the blend of Chinese and Korean flavors endures in the neighborhood's small slew of standout restaurants.\n\nI recommend taking a walk through the streets and alleyways of the neighborhood while munching on street food. I'm personally partial to the giant fried dumplings and tanghulu, or skewers of sugar-coated fruit, that I've enjoyed there.\n\nIf you have a chance, enjoy a sit-down meal of jjajangmyeon, a Chinese-Korean black bean noodle dish, and soak up some of the bustling area's history and culture.",

    "description": "The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, participated in scientific and military operations around the world.",
    "fullText": "On January 17, 1955, the USS Nautilus transmitted a historic message: \"Underway on nuclear power.\"\n\nAs the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, Nautilus could remain submerged for two weeks at a time and travel at speeds of over 20 knots, or about 23 miles per hour.\n\nPreviously, World War II submarines powered by diesel engines and electric batteries could stay underwater for just 12 to 48 hours at a time. Since their batteries only charged while surfaced, diesel-electric US Navy vessels like the USS Cobia had to move at around 2 or 3 miles per hour to conserve power and hit maximum speeds of 9 knots, or about 10 miles per hour.\n\nNautilus is now part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut. Visitors can walk through the historic nuclear submarine and see how its crew members lived and worked while submerged up to 700 feet below the surface.\n\nI visited the museum in March to tour Nautilus. Take a look inside.\n\nNautilus, which was commissioned in 1954, hosted the first-ever underwater legislative meeting when 13 members of Congress rode Nautilus in 1955.\n\nIts nuclear power allowed Nautilus to sail under the polar ice cap and become the first ship to traverse the North Pole in 1958 in an expedition known as Operation Sunshine.\n\nNautilus also participated in the naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n\nAfter 26 years of service, Nautilus was decommissioned in 1980 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1982. It opened to the public as part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut, in 1986.\n\nIn 2021, Nautilus underwent $36 million of preservation work and reopened in 2022.\n\nThe Submarine Force Museum is open Wednesday through Monday and is free to visit.\n\nI was amazed by the size of the submarine. As I climbed aboard, the deck provided gorgeous views of the Thames River.\n\nHere, crew members loaded torpedoes for firing.\n\nAfter the torpedoes were loaded, the tubes were flooded with water. When the command to fire was issued, high-pressure air from the submarine's ejection pump then forced the water and the torpedoes out of the tubes.\n\nSigns on the sink and mirror indicated that they were part of the submarine's original equipment.\n\nNautilus had a crew of 11 officers and 105 enlisted service members.\n\nA panel of instruments along the wardroom's wall indicated Nautilus' depth and speed.\n\nOfficers ate the same meals as the rest of the crew members, but their food was brought up to the officers' pantry via a dumbwaiter to be reheated and served on Navy china.\n\nThe walls of the narrow hallway were covered in wood paneling.\n\nThe book was gifted to Nautilus' commanding officer, Commander William R. Anderson, in 1957 by the French Navy's chief of staff, Adm. Henri Nomy. The fictional submarine in the book is also named Nautilus.\n\nFewer beds in a room indicated a higher rank.\n\nThe executive officer, also known as the \"XO,\" was the ship's second-in-command.\n\nThe commanding officer used the stateroom as a workspace and living quarters.\n\nThe yeoman managed the ship's correspondence and personnel records.\n\nThe attack center contained periscopes to spot enemy ships and the controls to aim and fire torpedoes.\n\nOn the diagram, Nautilus is represented by the bottom ship, and the top ship represents the target.\n\nThe torpedo firing key, which was used to deploy the torpedoes, was indicated with a blue sign on the firing panel.\n\nThe guns were used for security while the submarine was in port.\n\nSonar stands for \"sound navigation and ranging.\" Active sonar emitted sound pulses to locate targets, while passive sonar listened for underwater activity.\n\nBefore that, ladders were used to climb from one level to another.\n\nCommands were issued in the control room by a crew member known as the diving officer of the watch, who received orders from the attack center.\n\nWhen the main ballast tanks filled with water, the submarine would submerge. When filled with air, the submarine would surface.\n\nThe ESM bay's instruments could detect other ships' radars.\n\nThe radio room was located just off the control room on the right.\n\nHere, crew members ate meals, worked, and spent their recreational time.\n\nDamage control personnel used OBAs if fires broke out on board while submerged. The hoses on the masks could be attached to the submarine's reserve air supply.\n\nSince there was no Navy chaplain on board the submarine, crew member volunteers conducted services for various faiths with items from the lay services box.\n\nNautilus was mainly powered by its nuclear reactor, but the battery served as an auxiliary source of power in case of an emergency.\n\nA window connected the galley to the scullery, where crew members washed dishes.\n\nNautilus had two crew quarters, one at the front of the submarine and one at the back.\n\nI swiveled the periscope until I could see my car sitting in the museum's parking lot, which was pretty cool.\n\nJust over 70 years after Nautilus was commissioned as the first nuclear-powered submarine in the world, all of the US Navy's submarines are now nuclear-powered, according to the Department of Defense.",

    "fullText": "Making plans with your friends should be easy.\n\nHowever, between the various group chats, stacked schedules, and endless distractions, those plans can often fall to the wayside.\n\nEnter Rodeo, a new app from former C-suite executives at dating app Hinge. Cofounders Sam Levy (who was Hinge's COO) and Tim MacGougan (CPO), who are both parents, know firsthand how difficult it can be to make plans.\n\nRodeo's mission is to \"help friends be better friends with their friends,\" CEO Levy told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nThe startup, founded in 2023, recently launched a beta version of its app on the Apple's App Store. It's limited in features and doesn't have many social tools built in yet, but the tool is straightforward.\n\n\"Give us your chaos,\" the app tells its users.\n\nIf you see an event, a restaurant, or anything you'd want to do with your friends or family, you can send the social media post from Instagram or TikTok — or upload a screenshot — to the Rodeo app, which will then pull out all the details you'd need from it. You can do the same with a screenshot of a group chat.\n\nLevy likes describing the app as a \"second brain\" for planning activities with friends and family.\n\nRodeo uses AI under the hood to do some of that \"wrangling,\" MacGougan said, specifically a large language model (LLM) to help with natural language processing and decoding context.\n\nRodeo isn't shouting AI from the rooftops, however, unlike many startups right now.\n\n\"We never called ourselves an AI company,\" Levy said. \"It wasn't really in our pitch decks, ever.\"\n\nThe startup has raised funds from venture capital firms such as 359 Capital, Oceans Ventures, F7 Ventures, and BAM Ventures, as well as angel investors. Rodeo declined to disclose how much it's raised to date. Levy said the startup is still raising capital on a rolling basis.\n\nRodeo is one of many tech companies tackling what's been called a friendship recession.\n\nFor instance, dating app Bumble revamped its friend-making app BFF this year. Newcomers have also entered the market with tools aimed at helping people find new friendships. Those include 222, which connects strangers over dinner or local events.\n\n\"There's a lot of products out there helping you meet new people, which I think is a great mission,\" Levy said, but Rodeo is honing in on building stronger relationships with the people already in your life. \"How do you truly keep in touch with your close friends over time?\"\n\nLevy said that Rodeo now has about 20,000 people signed up for its waitlist and has onboarded about 5,000 users to the early version of the app. The startup plans to formally roll out its app in the first half of 2026. The full version will include more features, such as collaborative lists of things to do.\n\n\"We're not trying to replace where you are with your friends right now,\" like text messaging or social media feeds, MacGougan said.\n\nInstead, Rodeo wants to be a social tool to add on top of everything you're already using.\n\n\"This is taking the time you're spending on social media or online and leveraging it to help you ideally spend more time in real life with your friends,\" Levy said.",

    "fullText": "As buzzy as the term \"narcissist\" has become in recent years, many people find it too harsh or black-and-white — especially when describing their own parents.\n\nAt the same time, they feel stuck. They love their mom, but she dismisses any hint of criticism. They don't see their dad as a villain, but don't know why he never calls them, either.\n\nDr. Lindsay C. Gibson, a clinical psychologist, thought of these adult children when she coined the term \"emotionally immature parents\" and wrote her bestselling book on the topic.\n\nGibson, who wanted to help adult children stuck in unhealthy relationships with their parents, believed that labels like \"toxic\" were misleading.\n\n\"The parent does have good qualities,\" she previously told Business Insider. They might jump into action if their child is sick or needs financial support, for example. \"The problem is that those times happen on the parent's schedule, depending upon how secure or good that parent is feeling about themselves.\"\n\nWhen they aren't being affectionate, thoughtful, or charming, these parents can blow up, shut down, or simply become MIA at any hint of conflict, making their children feel like they're walking on eggshells.\n\nGibson said there are four types of emotionally immature parents. While a parent can be more than one type, she said that most tend to fall into one category. She defines each type by the parent's \"unique methods of coping with emotion and stress.\"\n\nShe shared the four types of emotionally immature parents — and the effects they have on their kids.\n\nReactive parents can be perfectly warm and loving — when everything goes their way.\n\nWhen it doesn't, they can suddenly become volatile and erratic, getting angry or upset over issues you wouldn't expect someone to.\n\nGibson refers to reactive parents as \"emotional parents\" because they behave like they're ruled by their feelings.\n\n\"They make life so unpleasant when they get upset that people start involuntarily automatically thinking twice before they speak or do something,\" Gibson said.\n\nOften, the children of these parents grow up to be people-pleasers, always on the lookout for potential conflict to stamp out. They may also have a hard time setting boundaries or even disentangling their feelings from their parents', instead prioritizing peacekeeping.\n\nHighly critical parents are perfectionists who nitpick at everything their child does. Gibson also calls them \"driven\" parents, because \"they're always going after something.\"\n\nIn childhood, they may pick apart your grades or gymnastics performance. In adulthood, it can evolve into judging your job, lifestyle, or appearance.\n\n\"They can be very pushy and very controlling,\" Gibson said, not caring about the impact their words have on you. \"It's coming from a belief that in order to be anybody or accomplish anything, you've got to really have that drive and keep on trying to be perfect, otherwise you're likely to be a total failure.\"\n\nChildren of highly critical parents can end up burning out or choosing careers they don't like, simply because their parents would disapprove of their passions.\n\nPassive parents are often the \"fun\" parents. In fact, they tend to be the most emotionally present out of all four types, Gibson said. They're at their best when they're playing a game with you or taking you to an amusement park.\n\n\"The problem is that they are just kind of passive in their role as a parent,\" Gibson said. When faced with more challenging aspects of parenthood, like pushing back if their spouse screams at their child, they step back. They might literally leave the room as abuse happens.\n\n\"They don't seem to feel that protective need to step in to help the child,\" Gibson said.\n\nWhen their child exhibits any uncomfortable emotions, such as anger or fear, the passive parent doesn't comfort or even acknowledge them. They might even deny a child's abuse allegations because it would complicate the family dynamic to confront the other parent or another relative.\n\nBecause they learn to hide their feelings — and receive no guidance on how to resolve conflict effectively — it's harder for them to have healthy relationships later in life, Gibson said.\n\nEmotionally absent parents act like their child doesn't exist. Gibson calls them \"rejecting\" parents because they're unable to respond to their child's emotional needs.\n\n\"That child feels not important enough to command the parent's attention,\" she said. It can cause issues in a child's self-esteem.\n\nKids of emotionally absent parents are so used to accepting the bare minimum from people that they might not have high standards for their partners or friends, Gibson said, continuing to gravitate to people who ignore them. Or, they may later date potentially manipulative people who finally give them the focus they've always craved (for their own nefarious reasons).\n\nIf you recognize your parent in any of these, there are a few things you can do to become less enmeshed.\n\nYou can set boundaries with a parent by slowing down your speech and calmly restating your needs. If you're always being criticized, you can practice the \"gray rock method,\" giving unemotional, neutral responses to keep drama at bay.\n\nIf those tactics are too challenging or you feel physically unsafe around your parent, you can consider lowering your contact or completely cutting ties.\n\nEven if it's tough at first, it's always possible to break the cycle by standing your ground and focusing on healthier relationships in your life.",

    "description": "Manhattan's most popular tourist attractions during the holidays include Rockefeller Center, Macy's, and Bryant Park.",
    "fullText": "When you're a native New Yorker, one thing you learn is that while the holiday season in New York City is magical, you should avoid tourist attractions at all costs.\n\nThere are plenty of other things to do during the holidays — for every Rolf's, there's a less crowded, more fun bar like Paddy Maguire's Ale House.\n\nBut I wanted to see if it was all that bad, so in 2023, I visited some of the biggest holiday tourist attractions in the city.\n\nTourism has only grown since then. According to a report published in November by the city's Economic Development Corporation, 48,000 more visitors per weekend on average visited Times Square in December 2024 than in December 2023, and Fifth Avenue saw 27,000 more weekend visitors in the same timeframe. Seasonal tourism also brings $500 million in revenue to the city.\n\nFor my holiday tour of Manhattan, I started at Wollman Rink in Central Park, walked to the Plaza Hotel and the Pulitzer Fountain, strolled down Fifth Avenue to Saks Fifth Avenue, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Rockefeller Center, continued west toward Bryant Park, and concluded my journey at Macy's Herald Square.\n\nWollman Rink, in the southern part of the park, is open from October through March. It's been a popular holiday destination for decades and has featured in numerous holiday movies, including \"Serendipity.\"\n\nI knew I was getting close to the rink, but even though I came to skate here in 2021, I had no recollection of seeing people peering down at me from a giant rock ledge.\n\nBut, lo and behold, when I climbed up to see what everyone was looking at, I was staring directly at the rink.\n\nYou can just make them out, but there are even more people across the ice at the other gate.\n\nWhen I skated at Wollman Rink, I found it was very disorganized compared to other rinks in the city, and I don't think I'll go back to skate.\n\nInstead, I decided on a hot drink.\n\nIt turns out that hot chocolate was just the thing to help me out.\n\nIn front of the door was a sign that said only guests of the hotel or patrons of the restaurant were allowed in the building.\n\nI watched as the hotel employee stopped anyone walking in to see what their business was and turned a few people away.\n\nA musician was singing \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\"\n\nFor a few years, the Pulitzer Fountain was transformed into an ice-skating rink with polar bears and penguins. They've since toned it down with some giant ornaments and lights.\n\nThis is the Peninsula Hotel, another New York City landmark.\n\nThere's also lots of legendary shopping on Fifth Avenue, from Bergdorf Goodman to Harry Winston to Cartier to Louis Vuitton and more.\n\nI shouldn't have been surprised by the crowds — New York City's visitor numbers have almost fully rebounded since pandemic lows.\n\nIn December 2025, 1010 Wins predicted 8 million people would visit New York City in the six weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's.\n\nYou have to be prepared for people to stop.\n\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral, the largest Gothic Catholic cathedral in the US, opened in 1879. More than 5 million people visit each year.\n\nEntry is free, which makes this a great activity for anyone on a budget. Plus, the church was decorated — there were wreaths and Christmas trees, and the main altar was covered in poinsettias.\n\nThe manger happened to be near an exit, meaning that stopping to take pictures here held up a significant amount of traffic.\n\nEvery way I turned, I watched people snap picture after picture.\n\nThe Saks Fifth Avenue I visited, which is actually on Fifth Avenue, is the department store's flagship. It opened in 1924 and has remained there for almost a century.\n\nThis year's display was called \"Your Story in Lights.\"\n\nThis year's light show is set to a \"curated medley of uplifting music.\" It runs every 10 minutes from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nThe store was selling ornaments and other holiday goodies back here, but I had to walk through the entire store just to get there.\n\nI haven't been back this year, but I've seen on social media that they've added some more decorations in front of the store.\n\nLego is a huge draw for parents looking to entertain their kids.\n\nIn 2025, the tree is a 75-foot Norwegian spruce from East Greenbush, New York.\n\nIt was all getting a bit claustrophobic for me.\n\nAlong the way, I saw Radio City Music Hall, home of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, but the street looked too crowded for me to even attempt getting closer.\n\nI'd recommend going to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular at least once. It's playing through January 2.\n\nBryant Park is home to one of the two largest holiday markets in Manhattan, the other being Union Square. I prefer Bryant Park since it's more open, has a better view, and is closer to where I live.\n\nThe last time I was there, it wasn't too crowded, but the same couldn't be said for this visit.\n\nIf you head to the Winter Village a few weeks before the holidays, it's a more enjoyable experience. But, as you inch closer to Christmas, it gets more crowded.\n\nThe lines were so long and densely packed that I decided I could wait.\n\nAccording to the 34th Street Partnership, the store has 1.25 million square feet of retail space across 12 floors and takes up an entire city block.\n\nMacy's moved to this location in 1902.\n\nI also felt guilty for getting in the way of other people's photos.\n\nWhen I returned an hour later, it was easier to sneak a peek.\n\nI just had to let the crowd take me where I needed to go.\n\nThey spare no expense decorating at Macy's.\n\nMacy's announced that Toys 'R' Us would be incorporated into its existing stores in 2021, ahead of the 2022 holiday season.\n\nToys 'R' Us returned for the 2025 season.\n\nThere were crowds of kids (not pictured) in the various aisles, at the play place, and inspecting the Funko Pops.\n\nThe toys were on the seventh floor, while Santa was up on the eighth floor.\n\nThere was a long line to meet Santa, even though you have to reserve a time to meet him.\n\nThis was the sixth floor, which was mostly dedicated to home and kitchen goods. I felt like I could finally breathe.\n\nNew York City is still my favorite place — and maybe everyone else's — to be during the holidays.",

    "title": "In Pursuit of the Monarch's Magnetic Sense",
    "description": "The magnetic compass is the last unknown sense in migrating animals. For some scientists, the monarch butterfly is leading the way.",
    "fullText": "In a storage shed beneath a cloudless Texas sky in November, Robin Grob performed open brain surgery on a monarch butterfly.\n\nSlips of tape held the butterfly’s black and orange wings open and pinned its fuzzy, white-spotted body under a microscope. Through the lens, the brain appeared as a tiny, yellowish mass, into which a tetrode — four electrodes, each thinner than a human hair — had been inserted. Peering down, Dr. Grob, a neurobiologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, carefully sealed the butterfly’s head with silicone, to keep the electrodes from shifting.\n\nThe butterfly struggled against the tape. “Calm down,” Dr. Grob said softly. “Stop moving.”\n\nThe next step was the hardest: moving the butterfly, tetrode and all, outdoors to the flight simulator, an open-ended metal cylinder the size of a coffee urn. Inside it, the butterfly would be tethered and allowed to fly through a carefully controlled magnetic field. One jarring motion en route would dislodge the electrodes and ruin hours of surgery. But if Dr. Grob succeeded — if the butterfly survived the transfer and the tetrode stayed in place — he could record the exact moment that its brain sensed the kind of magnetic field that guides monarchs across a continent.\n\nEvery year, monarchs travel thousands of miles from Canada to the oyamel fir forests of Mexico. To navigate, they use a set of internal compasses. But the exact physiology has mystified scientists for decades: How does an insect with a brain smaller than a grain of rice find the same forests year after year?\n\nAnimals, humans included, rely on an array of internal and external cues to navigate, including the position of the sun and stars, the polarization of light, a memory for geographical landmarks and more. Of all of these, the magnetic sense — the brain’s ability to detect Earth’s magnetic field with a compasslike sensitivity — remains the most elusive.\n\n“We understand how we can smell, how we can see, how we can hear, but we do not understand how animals can sense the magnetic field,” said David Dreyer, a neuroscientist at Lund University in Sweden. “It is the last sense that is not really understood.”\n\nThere are two main senses an animal can use for navigation: a map sense and a compass sense. A map sense is the ability of an animal to locate its current position relative to a specific place. A compass sense is an animal’s ability to use external cues to guide itself in a particular direction.\n\nLoggerhead sea turtles possess both: They can use Earth’s magnetic field as a compass to maintain a direction, but they can also use it as a kind of map for determining where they are. This means that they can navigate home, even from places they have never been before. Migratory insects, however, have a compass but no map. They can migrate in a particular direction, but there is no conclusive evidence that they know where they are relative to where they started or where they are headed.\n\nAs subjects of migration research, however, insects do offer one advantage over turtles and birds: Their brains and nervous systems are smaller and less complex, so their neural circuits are (relatively) simpler to decipher.\n\n“Large brains and nervous systems can be more challenging to work with when you’re really trying to understand what goes on in the brain,” said Kenneth Lohmann, a biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And monarchs could potentially be the key to understanding migratory mechanisms, he added.\n\nHowever, some scientists wonder whether insects like monarchs even possess a magnetic sense. “I don’t think they have one,” said Henrik Mouritsen, a biologist at Oldenburg University in Germany. Two decades ago, Dr. Mouritsen, who studies the magnetic compass in birds, published a study on monarch orientation that found no evidence of a magnetic sense.\n\n“I would like to see with my own eyes that those butterflies can do it, because I tried and I couldn’t get them to do it,” he said.\n\nBack in the shed, Dr. Grob stared at his computer screen as the first brain signals of the day flickered across the monitor. He had inserted electrodes into four distinct types of neurons in the monarch’s brain. But monarchs have about 100 million neurons, and he didn’t yet know if he had picked the right four, which lie in the central complex, the region that governs spatial orientation. It’s like “going in blind,” he said.\n\nThe experiment involved a certain amount of trial-and-error. After identifying four promising neurons, the researchers would take the monarch outside and let it attempt to fly southwest as they monitored the brain signals for evidence of magnetoreception. (Despite the harrowing process, butterflies don’t feel pain, as their nervous systems lack pain receptors.) If none emerged, they would start again with another butterfly.\n\nFor several years, Dr. Grob has been attempting these outdoors recordings. Part of the reason for working outside versus in a carefully controlled lab, is to let the animal think it’s migrating.\n\n“If we want to understand migration, we need to set the animals into the correct behavioral stage,” said Basil el Jundi, a neuroscientist at the University of Oldenburg whose lab designed the experiment. “You have to record from a flying animal while it’s actually navigating.”\n\nDr. Dreyer, who is not involved in the research, called the experiments, which combine a flight simulator with brain recordings, “brilliant.”\n\nIn 2000, Steven Reppert, a neuroscientist at UMass Chan Medical School, was driving through the Midwest when he saw what looked like an orange, low-hanging cloud ahead.\n\n“The air was so thick with monarchs that several smashed into my car windows,” he said in an email. “I pulled off the road and stopped the car, gazing at this amazing spectacle.”\n\nUp until then, most research on monarchs focused on ecology: where they went, how many survived. But watching that orange cloud, Dr. Reppert had a different thought. “It then hit me that the monarch butterfly and the mechanisms behind its spectacular migratory behavior needed to be studied,” he said.\n\nOver the next two decades, Dr. Reppert led more than 20 studies exploring how the monarch’s internal clock guides its navigation. His findings transformed the field: that monarchs can use both the sun’s position and the pattern of polarized daylight to determine direction; that their navigational circadian clocks reside in their antennae, not in their brains; that certain genes encode timekeeping photoreceptors that are essential for navigation; and that the sun compass used for navigation is found in the region of the brain known as the central complex.\n\nOne of Dr. Reppert’s postdoctoral students was Christine Merlin. She developed reverse genetics in monarchs, removing specific genes to see which ones altered the insect’s navigation mechanisms. Now a chronobiologist at Texas A&M University, just miles from Dr. Grob’s shed, Dr. Merlin has turned her attention to the magnetic sense, and has been closing in on the actual sensors.\n\nA 2021 paper by Dr. Merlin, published in the journal Nature Communications, showed that a specific gene, CRY1, was necessary for the magnetic response in monarchs. The study also showed that the antennae and eyes were involved in sensing the magnetic field. But in what physiological or biochemical structure, exactly?\n\nKayla Goforth, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Merlin’s lab, is using CRISPR, a gene-editing tool, to remove specific genes from monarchs, and is testing to determine which parts encode for magnetic navigation. She breeds monarchs that lack certain genes, and then sees whether they can still orient using magnetic fields. Her goal is to find the molecule where “all of these quantum-level reactions are occurring,” she said. In theory, the research holds the potential for developing human navigation systems that don’t rely on satellites, serving as an alternative when GPS is unavailable.\n\n“If you can develop a navigational tool based on Earth’s magnetic field, you can’t lose it,” Dr. Goforth said. “It’s always there. It’s there day or night.”\n\nThe work is painstaking. But the implications extend far beyond insects. Understanding the mechanisms that monarchs use for orientation could help explain how other species migrate and navigate, Dr. Reppert said.\n\nThat group could potentially include humans. “Do humans have a magnetic sense?” Dr. Reppert said. “We may have a subconscious sense of Earth’s magnetic field. But there is only scant evidence of conscious perception.”\n\nThe two teams, Dr. el Jundi’s and Dr. Merlin’s, also run experiments to understand other aspects of magnetoreception, including its place in the hierarchy of compass cues. When do monarchs use the sun to navigate? How do both compasses work together? Why use the sun at all when the magnetic field seems more reliable?\n\n“This is a great adventure,” Dr. el Jundi said. In effect, the two labs are approaching the mystery — “how the brain of migratory insects encodes migration,” he said — from opposite ends. Dr. Merlin’s work is upstream, identifying where in the butterfly’s body the magnetic sensors are and which genes control them, as well as what is happening at a molecular level. Dr. Grob and Dr. el Jundi’s work is downstream, recording how the brain processes magnetic information after the sensors detect it. Much like the monarch’s migration: beginning at one place, ending at another.\n\nOnce the silicone had hardened on Dr. Grob’s monarch, he carefully lifted the insect and walked out of the shed toward the flight simulator. Would the hours of surgery yield useful data or be yet another failed attempt?\n\nHe attached the butterfly to the simulator’s tether, and after a few soft taps to motivate it, the insect’s wings began to beat. Signals appeared on the computer screen, spikes along two sine waves. Dr. Grob watched closely as the butterfly adjusted its flight angle.\n\nSomewhere in a brain smaller than a grain of rice might lie the answer to how living beings tap into an invisible field to journey across the planet. “This is beyond just a monarch,” he said.",

    "description": "My wife Lori's birthday was Christmas Eve. For years, I could only cry — now, I've learned to find peace in her memory and love.",
    "fullText": "It's been almost five years since my wife Lori passed. But, as the cool weather sets in and fall's kaleidoscope of colors paints the landscape as far as the eye can see, my mind begins to wander.\n\nFrom the time the last leaf turns brown and falls to the ground to the time the first flakes of snow land, I know the clock is ticking down to December 24 — Lori's birthday.\n\nThe first year was the roughest.\n\nMy most recent memory of her birthday was her 51st, only a few weeks after the doctors said there was nothing left to do but wait for the inevitable. But Lori ignored that. For 23 years, she lived with a malignant brain tumor and was told this is it. And then, it wasn't.\n\nOn what would be her last birthday, I made her a three-layer cake filled with strawberries and covered in a chocolate ganache, prepared pancakes (which was her favorite food group), and gave her chocolate from her favorite shop, a cubic zirconium engagement ring because her actual engagement ring no longer fit on her fingers, and a needlepoint kit that she could use from her wheelchair. And when she went to sleep, I cried.\n\nThis was the memory stuck in my head. This was the memory that haunted me. And every year since she died, I hope that on the anniversary of her birthday, the memory of any one of the other 33 birthdays I celebrated with Lori would somehow show their face, and bring a smile instead of tears. For three years I waited.\n\nAnd then, last year, it finally happened. On what would have been her 55th birthday, I was reading Lori's diaries, which I did from time to time, pretending I could still talk with her. I came across a passage she wrote about her 35th birthday. I smiled. Lori had just recovered from yet another brain surgery and radiation and told her doctors that, come the first snowstorm, she would be skiing. It had been 10 years since we got married, and as a birthday present, I thought we would invite friends and family to the summit of our favorite ski resort so we could renew our wedding vows.\n\nAnd the memories started rushing in.\n\nIt was December 24, 2005, at 6 a.m., and there were already a couple of inches of snow on the ground. The forecast was calling for 12 more. The house smelled like last night's fireplace. I looked at Lori sleeping next to me. She was wearing her snowman pajama bottoms and a top she affectionately called her \"Thug Muppet.\" It's essentially a super-soft, fleece-lined hoodie with neon orange drawstrings.\n\nI hated to wake her, but if I didn't give Lori her birthday gifts immediately, we wouldn't have time alone again until the next day. She had spent the day before her birthday wrapping her ski poles with plastic flowers. There were orchids, roses, lilies, and lace to hold it all together. She put Powerpuff Girls stickers on her skis and laid out a little black dress (her standard evening uniform) as her outfit for the evening.\n\nI leaned over and gently kissed her on the forehead, telling her it was time to wake up. As usual, she asked for five more minutes, telling me it was still dark outside. I whispered, \"It's snowing.\" Lori's eyes light up. \"Will we have time to do a run in the terrain park before the ceremony? I have a new trick I want to try.\" I ask if we can try to avoid her breaking something until after the ceremony is over.\n\nShe rolled out of bed, saw the pile of presents on the floor, and immediately started tearing the wrapping paper off. Leaving a trail of crumpled paper throughout the house, Lori starts telling me the trick she wants to do. She blurts out, \"It's better than the one yesterday!\"\n\nThe day before, she had jumped off a \"small\" set of rocks while skiing in the trees. Usually, she follows me in the trees, but she decided I was moving too slowly. She was about 25 yards ahead of me when I heard \"Woo Hoo!\" and then she disappeared.\n\nI was so focused on trying to figure out where she went that I barely had time to brace myself before I, too, was in the air. My arms swing wildly like I am jumping rope in midair and just praying I don't face plant when I land. I see her now. Giggling, covered from head to toe in snow. Her skis and poles are strewn all over the snow in multiple directions. She looks like a yeti. Her smile is intoxicating. I can't help but start laughing too.\n\n\"Did you see that? I was flying.\" I lie and say it was amazing. I usually can't watch when she does these tricks. I keep thinking she is going to crash. The parade of horrors that awaits reads like a top 10 list for what happens when stupid human tricks go bad. To Lori, these are just details. After all, she is supposed to be dead already. At least according to the doctors.\n\nNow Lori wants to launch herself into the air and try a 360° spin before she lands. Who am I to tell her no? Diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor shortly before our third anniversary, Lori and I never thought we would see our 10th anniversary, let alone her 35th birthday, and now we were going to renew our wedding vows in a blizzard at the summit of a ski resort in front of our friends and family, but not before Lori tries to stick the landing.\n\nI can't believe it will be 20 years since that day. Time does pass quickly, and yet, at the same time seems to stand still. All my memories feel as if I am remembering something that happened yesterday.\n\nI can still hear Lori's voice, giddy with excitement as she wonders what the next unwrapping will reveal. I feel this warmth flow through my veins, remembering how I could not resist the urge to tell her my journey of how each gift came to be, and watching her try on or play with every gift as it was removed from the box it came in.\n\nAnd yet, it so long ago, that I have already forgotten the stress of figuring out how to get 25 people to the summit of a mountain when none of them ski, finding a justice of the peace willing to stand and perform the ceremony in the middle of a snowstorm, and mostly wondering whether it was even a good idea in the first place because Lori's head had not quite healed from her surgery.\n\nBut, in the end, what matters most is that I no longer cry on Christmas Eve. I expect that this year, for the first time, I will actually be able to celebrate Christmas Eve as a time of joy, knowing that I can finally experience it that way. And I have learned that if I am willing to let myself remember the good times, I might have many more happy days that were once sad. And that is Lori's greatest gift to me: a lesson. Don't lament fate or dwell on what you have lost; instead, enjoy what you have and look forward to tomorrow.",

    "fullText": "In \"Marty Supreme,\" Timothée Chalamet plays a ping pong hustler who will stop at nothing to get his way. On the set of the Josh Safdie film, the star was similarly determined to get the right shot — even if it meant withstanding some physical pain.\n\nNear the end of the movie, Chalamet's character Marty Mauser begs business tycoon Milton Rockwell (Kevin O'Leary) to front the money for a table tennis rematch in Japan against his rival Koto Endo (real-life table tennis champion Koto Kawaguchi). After Mauser initially declined Rockwell's gracious offer earlier in the movie, the businessman won't let him off easy this time. Rockwell agrees to hold the match — but only if he can first cut Mauser down to size. How? By spanking him.\n\nMauser reluctantly agrees. He drops his pants and bends over a chair as Rockwell, surrounded by party guests, spanks Mauser's bare bottom with a ping pong paddle.\n\nO'Leary told Business Insider that Chalamet insisted on actually being spanked in the scene.\n\n\"We had a stand-in ass and a fake paddle that supposedly would not put the full force,\" O'Leary said. \"All of a sudden, Chalamet came on set and said, 'No, if this ass is going to be immortalized, it's my ass.'\"\n\nThe \"Shark Tank\" star said he was stunned and tried to talk Chalamet out of it.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, man, your ass is gonna be blistered, let the stand-in ass do it,'\" he recalled. \"He said, 'No.' I said, 'I can't hold back, I'm gonna have to whack your ass.' He said, 'I don't give a shit.'\"\n\nO'Leary said the fake paddle broke on the first hit, so he had to use a real ping pong paddle on Chalamet's rear end.\n\nO'Leary estimated he spanked Chalamet \"more than a dozen\" times while filming the scene.\n\n\"Josh kept saying, 'Harder! Harder!'\" O'Leary said, referring to director Josh Safdie. \"And the one where you see Chalamet's face explode, I really whacked his ass. That's what is in the movie.\"\n\nThe pain might have been worth it. \"Marty Supreme\" had the largest pre-theater average of the year ($145,000) when it opened in limited release last weekend. That's also the biggest average for any movie since 2016 and the largest ever for its distributor, A24.\n\n\"Marty Supreme\" opens in wide release on Christmas Day.",

    "description": "Morgan Stanley's top economist wrote this week that as long as prices can remain elevated, companies might be able to avoid having to slash headcount.",
    "fullText": "The job market is brutal right now, and there's growing concern that 2026 could see more layoffs. However, Morgan Stanley says that many companies may be able to avoid having to slash head count.\n\nThe bank's chief US economist, Michael T. Gapen, and his team wrote on Tuesday that the US economy may be able to avoid widespread layoffs in 2026 but only if companies continue hiking prices, after already raising them throughout 2025.\n\nRising layoffs and sticky inflation were two of the big macro themes that defined 2025. According to Gapen and his team, companies opted to decrease hiring and reduce staffing to avoid raising prices earlier in the year as tariff pressures kicked in.\n\nNow, Morgan Stanley says that this may be the key to avoiding widespread layoffs in the coming year.\n\n\"We think the majority of the tariff pass-through to final consumer prices will have been completed at that point, assuming the administration does not push tariff policy further,\" Gapen said. \"On net, our outlook assumes inflation firms, profitability is largely restored, and the economy avoids layoffs.\"\n\nThe economist added that his team doesn't expect the Trump administration to implement new tariffs as the 2026 midterm elections approach. Yet, the analysts also emphasize that they don't think companies are done raising prices.\n\nThe bank maintains its baseline view that the existing tariffs will push core inflation to 3% early in 2026, with signs already being seen in the cost of consumer goods.\n\n\"Monthly rates of consumer price inflation in June through September have come with observable increases in components of CPI and PCE that have high direct exposure to tariffs,\" Gapen wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley's analysis also found that companies have started to recoup some of the money they lost in early 2025 after being impacted by tariffs. That's a promising development, particularly as the bank predicts that many firms can raise prices while still maintaining the bulk of their customer base.\n\nHowever, the thesis that higher prices can help prevent layoffs in 2026 only applies so long as customers continue to stomach higher costs.\n\nConsumers have a limit to how much more they'll pay for goods, particularly as economic uncertainty remains high. It is unclear just how high prices can go before shoppers balk.\n\n\"If firms found they could not push output prices higher on account of consumer resistance and loss of market share, then we think they would turn to reducing labor costs further, triggering layoffs,\" Morgan Stanley added.",

    "title": "The AI bubble debate: 17 business leaders, from Sam Altman to Bill Gates to Peter Thiel, weigh in",
    "description": "OpenAI's Sam Altman sparked fears of an AI bubble. Business leaders like Bill Gates, Mark Cuban, and Jensen Huang disagree over whether one exists.",
    "fullText": "The AI boom shows no sign of slowing down. Some top business leaders are concerned that a bubble is about to burst.\n\nIn August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave voice to those fears about the future of AI. Since then, other CEOs, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, have dismissed concerns of an AI bubble. Wall Street is also worried about the increasing circular nature of Big Tech's spending spree.\n\nHere's what leading tech CEOs and business leaders are saying about what's ahead.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the AI market is in a bubble.\n\n\"When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\" Altman recently told reporters, per The Verge.\n\nAltman said this describes the state of play.\n\n\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates says AI is in a bubble — just not to the extent of Danish tulips.\n\n\"The value is extremely high, just like creating the internet ended up being, in net, very valuable,\" Gates told CNBC in late October. \"But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.\"\n\nGates said that the situation reminds him of dot-com bubble when overvalued internet companies sparked a crash.\n\n\"Absolutely, there are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends,\" he said.\n\nStill, the billionaire said that AI remains a major breakthrough, calling it \"the biggest technical thing ever in my lifetime.\"\n\nMark Cuban, who famously sold Broadcast.com just before the dot-com bubble burst, said he doesn't see similarities to the current situation.\n\n\"There were people creating companies with just a website and going public. That's a bubble where there's no intrinsic value at all,\" Cuban told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2024. '\"People aren't even trying to make operating cap profits, they're just trying to leverage the frothiness of the stock market, that's a bubble. You don't see that right now. \"\n\nCuban took particular notice of the quality of AI companies going public.\n\n\"We're not seeing funky AI companies just go public,\" he said. \"If all of a sudden we see a rush of companies who are skins on other people's models or just creating models to create models that are going public, then yeah, that's probably the start of a bubble.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI could become a bubble, but there will only be a crash if companies fail to keep making advancements.\n\n\"If the models keep on growing in capability year-over-year and demand keeps growing, then maybe there is no collapse,\" Zuckerberg told the \"Access\" podcast in September.\n\nZuckerberg said there are risks that the AI boom becomes like the dot-com bubble.\n\n\"There's definitely a possibility, at least empirically, based on past large infrastructure buildouts and how they led to bubbles, that something like that would happen here.\"\n\nFor Meta, Zuckerberg said the real risk is not spending enough.\n\n\"The risk, at least for a company like Meta, is probably in not being aggressive enough rather than being somewhat too aggressive,\" he said.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn't see a bubble.\n\n\"I don't believe we're in an AI bubble,\" Huang told Bloomberg TV.\n\nHuang said that instead of overspeculation, AI is part of a transition from an old way of computing.\n\n\"We're going through a natural transition from an old computing model based on general purpose computing to accelerated computing,\" he said. \"We also know that AI has become good enough because of reasoning capability, and research capability, its ability to think — it's now generating tokens and intelligence that is worth paying for.\"\n\nNvidia is skyrocketing amid AI-fueled hope. In late October, the chipmaker became the world's first $5 trillion market cap company.\n\nHuang said Nvidia is happy to pay for AI for its employees, name-checking Cursor, an AI coding agent, as one of many services for which his company pays.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said there is some \"irrationality\" in the AI boom. He also cautioned that if a bubble were to burst, its blast radius would extend across the private sector.\n\n\"I think no company is going to be immune, including us,\" Pichai told the BBC in November.\n\nComparing the current moment to the Dotcom era, Pichai said that sometimes investment cycles can \"overshoot.\"\n\n\"I expect AI to be the same,\" he said. \"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says AI is in a bubble, but not in the way everyone might think.\n\nBezos called the current situation an \"industrial bubble.\" The world's third-richest person said there are similarities now, including the frenzy of investments.\n\n\"The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas,\" he said in October during a conference in Italy. \"And that's also probably happening today.\"\n\nBezos said that hoopla shouldn't overshadow the reality that \"AI is real\" and will change society.\n\n\"The [bubbles] that are industrial are not nearly as bad,\" Bezos said. \"It can even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners. Societies benefit from those inventions.\"\n\nJPMorgan Vice Chairman Daniel Pinto said he sees a correction coming.\n\n\"There is probably a correction there,\" Pinto said at a Bloomberg event in November.\n\nPinto said the market is pushing valuations beyond current justifications.\n\n\"In order to justify these valuations, you are considering a level of productivity that, it will happen, but it may not happen as fast as the market is pricing now,\" he said.\n\nLike Altman, OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor says we're in an AI bubble.\n\n\"I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,\" Taylor told The Verge in September. \"I think we're also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.\"\n\nTaylor, who is also CEO of Sierra, also sees some similarities to the dot-com bubble. He also said that some of the internet companies that failed in the 90s were just ahead of their time.\n\n\"Even things like Webvan, there's now, as the internet became more distributed, really healthy businesses like Instacart and DoorDash and others that were built now that the smartphone and the scale of the internet has matured,\" he said. \"So even some of the specific ideas were actually not that bad, but maybe a little early.\"\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt said just because it looks like a bubble doesn't mean that it is.\n\n\"I think it's unlikely, based on my experience, that this is a bubble,\" Schmidt said in July during an appearance at the RAISE Summit in Paris. \"It's much more likely that you're seeing a whole new industrial structure.\"\n\nSchmidt said it takes solace in where the hardware and chips markets stand.\n\n\"You have these massive data centers, and Nvidia is quite happy to sell them all the chips,\" he said. \"I've never seen a situation where hardware capacity was not taken up by software.\"\n\nFormer Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says AI is in a bubble, but it won't pop for \"several years.\"\n\n\"Are we in an AI bubble? Of course. Of course we are,\" Gelsinger told CNBC in October. \"I mean, we're hyped. We're accelerating. We're putting enormous leverage into the system.\"\n\nGelsinger said that businesses are just beginning to reap the benefits of AI.\n\n\"As Jensen (Huang) talked about, and I agree with this, you know that businesses are yet to really start materially benefiting from it,\" he said. \"We're displacing all of the internet and the service provider industry as we think about it today — we have a long way to go.\"\n\nAlibaba cofounder Joe Tsai has voiced concerns about the scramble for data centers needed to help power the next generation of AI models.\n\n\"I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,\" Tsai told the HSBC Global Investment Summit in March, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nTsai said he's worried the building rush might outpace demand.\n\n\"I start to get worried when people are building data centers on spec,\" he said. \"There are a number of people coming up, funds coming out, to raise billions or millions of capital.\"\n\nHedge fund icon Ray Dalio voiced concerns about a bubble earlier this year, when DeepSeek's rollout led analysts to rethink AI's outlook.\n\n\"Where we are in the cycle right now is very similar to where we were between 1998 or 1999,\" Dalio told the Financial Times in January. \"There's a major new technology that certainly will change the world and be successful. But some people are confusing that with the investments being successful.\"\n\nAt the time, Dalio cited high stock prices and high interest rates. The good news is that Wall Street widely expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates during its September meeting.\n\nBillionaire tech CEO Thomas Siebel said there is \"absolutely\" an AI bubble and that it's \"huge.\"\n\n\"So we have this similar thing going on with generative AI that we've seen with previous technologies,\" Siebel told Fortune in January. \"The market is way, way overvaluing.\"\n\nSiebel, who leads C3.ai, singled out OpenAI in terms of overevaluations.\n\n\"If it disappeared, it wouldn't make any difference in the world,\" he said. \"Nothing would change. I mean, nobody's life would change. No company would change. Microsoft would find something else to power Copilot. There's like 10 other products available that would do it equally as good.\"\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su says the bubble talk \"is completely wrong.\"\n\n\"For those who are talking about a 'bubble,' I think they're being too narrow in their thinking of, what is the return on investment today or over the next six months,\" Su told Time Magazine in 2024. \"I think you have to look at this technology arc for AI over the next five years, and how does it fundamentally change everything that we do? And I really believe that AI has that potential.\"\n\nNicolai Tangen, who runs the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, said if AI is a bubble, \"it may not be such a bad bubble.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times in November, the CEO of Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said that AI is a \"pretty hot space\" right now, fueled by hype and a wave of capital. As the technology marks a sweeping societal shift, traditional valuations can be difficult to determine.\n\nTangen said overvaluation isn't entirely negative. The sheer volume of capital rushing into AI will ultimately fund technologies that boost long-term productivity — from automation to data processing to new types of AI models.\n\nThe hard part for investors is telling real breakthroughs apart from noise in a landscape still dominated by a few powerful platform companies, he added.\n\nPeter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who cofounded PayPal, indicated recently that he's skeptical of the notion of an AI bubble.\n\n\"My macroeconomic placeholder is that it's going to keep going,\" Thiel said in a December interview with The Spectator, referring to the economic growth driven by the technology.\n\nThiel also said that he's been asked about an AI bubble frequently by people in Europe, which is \"how you know that they're not going to build a lot of AI in Europe.\"\n\n\"There is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it,\" Thiel said. \"I don't think it's big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\"\n\nDespite his projections of future growth, Thiel also said that there are \"all sorts of things that I don't particularly like about the AI revolution,\" including that it's concentrated in a handful of large companies and that AI is \"probably more of a substitute than a complement\" to human labor.\n\n\"It will have a zero-sum feel to a lot of people,\" Thiel said.",

Sibling comments get starved for attention, while replies always steal the spotlight, dominating the discourse.\n\nThis makes the reading experience feel meandering, scatterbrained, and unfocused. Conversations often feel like they drift into squabbling and pedantry, because that's what the platform design prioritizes and presents.\n\nAs the reader scans top-down, they are effectively led through a “depth-first” traversal into all subdiscussions. Comment replies (no matter their quality or relevance) are always given precedence to sidetrack and derail the reading experience.\n\nThe issue magnifies for larger threads, where most readers never scroll down far enough to get past the first reply, or even the first reply to the first reply. Commenters also pile on to the first comment’s replies, knowing that that is prime real estate, and thus artificially inflating the discourse there.\n\nHere's the same reply thread as above, shown a different way.\n\nThe default HN reading experience is still available, you can read down the leftmost vertical edge and recreate the depth-first comment traversal.\n\nHowever, as you’ll notice, for each level you can now easily see the sibling comments as well and jump to them.\n\nPower-user keyboard shortcuts make all this effortless:\n\nThat’s really it. The magic is in hitting Left / Right which quickly allows you to “opt out” of going down any reply thread rabbit-hole. This is my favorite feature and I call it: “thank u, next”.\n\nLeft / Right gets you breadth-first traversal, instead of depth-first traversal, as a first-class operation. You are in control.\n\nThe tool is available at hn-comments.netlify.app.\n\nOr for your convenience, modify the URL for any comment thread to load it in the tool:\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46352930\n\nhttps://hn-comments.netlify.app/item?id=46352930",

First, however, he'd have to lift spirits.\n\nThen came the acquisition by a buyer group led by Fortress Investment Group, followed by the installation of Adamolekun as CEO. On Fortune's \"Next to Lead\" podcast, the new leader said his first days were tough.\n\n\"It's a company that's been through a lot,\" he said. \"Morale is very low. People are beat down.\"\n\nAdamolekun said that it was important to come in with a \"message of hope\" and \"possibility.\" In his first town hall, he said that Red Lobster would execute the greatest comeback in the history of the restaurant industry.\n\nHis goal was \"galvanizing the team around a vision,\" he said.\n\nAdamolekun had done it before. Prior to his Red Lobster role, Adamolekun led Paulson and Associates' investment in P.F. Chang's. He became the chief strategy officer and took over as CEO in 2020.\n\nUnder his leadership, P.F. Chang's launched its to-go business, a boon during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under his leadership, the company reached revenues of about $1 billion.\n\nRed Lobster has a long way to go to see that kind of turnaround. By the end of 2023, the company had incurred operating losses exceeding $10 million per quarter. The pandemic didn't help, and America's movement away from seafood and toward steakhouses meant a dwindling customer base.\n\nAdamolekun told Fortune that he was organizing his effort around three principles: food, hospitality, and ambience.\n\nHe listed new products like seafood boils, a new program called Red Carpet Hospitality about making people feel \"like family,\" and efforts to remodel the restaurants.\n\nSome of those were quick, he said, like changing menus and instituting bonus plans. Redesigning the restaurants takes more time, he said.\n\n\"That's been the bulk of our attention,\" he said. \"It's just improving the actual experience for our guests.\"\n\nNow a year into Adamolekun's tenure, the question remains: Will his efforts work?\n\nThere have been some mixed signals. Bloomberg reported that the company cut some executives as it attempts to renegotiate those leases that remain a drag.\n\nBut customers seem excited. The seafood boil was a certified hit.",

After traveling to all 50 states, though, I realized that charm can be found anywhere, often in the most unexpected places.\n\nDon't get me wrong — I love a good New York moment and will never turn down a Las Vegas trip — but America's real magic often lies in its lesser-known gems.\n\nThese are some of my favorite cities to visit that I think are underrated for serving up culture, fun, and character without the crowds or clichés.\n\nI gravitate toward places with a balance of city, country, mountains, and water, and in my opinion, Boise is just that: a Goldilocks city.\n\nYou can hike the foothills, float the river, and brewery-hop all in one day. Boise's downtown area is compact and walkable, with murals, boutiques, and tons of restaurants.\n\nStumbling upon the Basque Block — a cultural district where you'll often smell paella sizzling in the streets — was one of my favorite surprises.\n\nThe local chain Boise Fry Co. introduced me to more potato varieties than I knew existed, and I also enjoyed the silly baked-potato-shaped ice cream sundae at Westside Drive In.\n\nThere are tons of outdoor activities here, too. Bogus Basin, a ski area just 40 minutes from downtown, offers opportunities for skiing and tubing in the winter and mountain biking and hiking in the summer.\n\nKansas City is where my husband grew up, and the first time I visited, I was blown away. Before Taylor Swift sightings were a thing, it wasn't a city you heard much about, but its downtown area is stunning.\n\nCountry Club Plaza, established in 1922, is an open-air shopping district with a layout and design inspired by Seville, Spain. I loved going here for a romantically cheesy gondola ride before hunting for local finds at Made in KC Marketplace and Charlie Hustle, a popular apparel store.\n\nAs the first US city to roll out free public transportation, I was extremely impressed by how easy and affordable it was to get around.\n\nThe KC Streetcar can bring you from Union Station to the free Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, home to the iconic shuttlecock sculptures (a must for the 'gram).\n\nAs far as food goes, KC's barbecue lives up to the hype — I highly recommend heading to Joe's for the Z-Man smoked-brisket sandwich. The Museum of BBQ offers a fascinating look into the legacy.\n\nFinally, in the 18th & Vine District, the American Jazz Museum and Negro Leagues Baseball Museum share a roof for one of the coolest cultural combos in the Midwest.\n\nI'd heard other Midwesterners call it \"Little Chicago,\" but Milwaukee is so much more than that.\n\nWeird and wacky is my MO, and this is a city after my own heart — from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame to the historic Pabst Mansion, where you can tour the beer baron's home.\n\nEven the Milwaukee Art Museum has moveable wings that \"take flight\" each morning.\n\nI recommend starting the day on the RiverWalk, a 3-mile stretch lined with cafés and public art, including the free RiverSculpture gallery.\n\nWhile you're there, snap a selfie with the Bronze Fonz, then follow your nose to the Milwaukee Public Market. Save room for a drink at SafeHouse, though — this spy-themed speakeasy is iconic.\n\nPro tip: Visit in June for Summerfest, the world's largest music festival, and catch a Brewers game for the beloved sausage mascot race — a proud local tradition I've been watching since high school.\n\nSince Drew Carey said that \"Cleveland rocks,\" I've mostly heard Ohio used as a punchline, which made its gems all the more surprising.\n\nI was blown away by the city's architecture, from The Arcade (a historic shopping center) to West Side Market — and even Heinen's Grocery Store, a supermarket located in an opulent building from 1907.\n\nI'm a sucker for unique museums. My biggest recommendations are the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, which is practically a pilgrimage for music lovers, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nI was also surprised to find one of the country's last free national parks at Cuyahoga Valley National Park, along with 18 Metroparks and even Lake Erie beaches. Wherever I was in Cleveland, nature never felt too far away.",

    "description": "Ina Garten first made her brownie pudding in 2008, but it has recently found new life on TikTok. The decadent dessert is perfect for the holidays.",
    "fullText": "Garten's brownie pudding first appeared in her 2008 cookbook \"Barefoot Contessa: Back to Basics.\" It has found newfound popularity after the Food Network posted an old clip of Garten making the recipe on her \"Barefoot Contessa\" cooking show to its official TikTok page on November 7.\n\nDuring the episode, Garten revealed she was making the brownie pudding to celebrate her and Jeffrey's 40th wedding anniversary because she used to send him boxes of brownies after they first met as teenagers.\n\n\"I think he was the most popular guy in the dorm when they arrived,\" she said. \"So, I think brownie pudding is very romantic for our anniversary.\"\n\nGarten learned the brownie pudding recipe from the late chef Anna Pump, whom she met while running her Barefoot Contessa store in 1978.\n\n\"Mom was hired to cook, but the beginning of a beautiful friendship began,\" Sybille van Kempen, Pump's daughter, previously told Business Insider. \"Mom and Ina motivated each other. They shared ideas and supported each other's growth.\"\n\nTo make Garten's brownie pudding at home, you'll need:\n\nFramboise, by the way, is a raspberry liqueur. According to Garten, it's an ingredient that you \"really can't quite taste, but it makes everything else taste better.\"\n\nI forgot to take my eggs out of the fridge before I started this dish, so I let them soak in a bowl of warm water while I prepared the rest of my ingredients.\n\nIf you try this trick at home, just make sure the water isn't too hot — you don't want the eggs to start cooking!\n\nGarten takes butter seriously, especially when it comes to this dish. The ingredient is essential for making the brownie pudding \"very wet and delicious.\"\n\n\"You can't make brownies without butter,\" Garten says while demonstrating this dish on a \"Barefoot Contessa\" episode. \"Anyone who tries to make brownies without butter should be arrested!\"\n\nA quick tip: cut each stick of butter into knobs if you want them to melt quickly.\n\nGarten recommends using an oval baking dish that measures 9 inches by 12 inches, but she said \"any similar size will work with this.\" The closest dish I could find was 8 inches by 11.5 inches, and it worked great for this recipe!\n\nWhile two sticks of butter were melting on the stove, I used another knob to lightly butter my dish. I recommend using cold butter, which will glide over your dish with ease and speed.\n\n\"I'm just gonna snip off the end, and then run my knife right down the middle and scrape out the seeds,\" Garten explains on her show.\n\nBefore I began making the batter, I sifted my cocoa powder and flour together and set my bowl aside.\n\nIf you have a stand mixer at home, you can do a lot of this prep while your mixer is beating the eggs and sugar. Since I only have a handheld mixer, I wanted to get everything done beforehand.\n\nI cracked my four eggs into a bowl and added the sugar.\n\nThis task is obviously much easier with a stand mixer, but it wasn't too tough with a handheld one. Plus, I'll take any extra exercise I can get during the holiday season.\n\nGarten says you'll know when the egg-and-sugar mixture is ready once it turns \"very thick and light yellow.\"\n\n\"There's always one ingredient in a dish that you really can't quite taste, but it makes everything else taste better, and in this one, it's one tablespoon of framboise,\" Garten explains on her show.\n\nA deliciously chocolatey scent filled the kitchen as I mixed everything together until the ingredients had just combined.\n\nAs with the previous step, I made sure to mix the ingredients until just combined.\n\nAnd just like that, my batter was ready!\n\nPer Garten's instructions, I added the \"hottest tap water\" to the pan until it came halfway up the side of the smaller baking dish.\n\nCooking the brownie pudding in a water bath ensures that \"it bakes really evenly,\" Garten explained during the \"Barefoot Contessa\" episode.\n\nGarten says you can check if your pudding is ready by inserting a cake tester 2 inches from the side, which should come out \"¾ clean.\" She also warned that the center of the dish could \"appear very under-baked.\"\n\nMy brownie pudding didn't look under-baked at all. I was actually worried I had overbaked it. So I just took it straight out of the oven.",

    "title": "Ukrainian soldiers have incredible tactical patience and are far happier moving slowly than the British military",
    "description": "The Ukrainians are \"are very happy being slow\" as they know they need to secure everything, a British military officer told BI.",
    "fullText": "Some Western trainers working with Ukrainian soldiers first assumed their trainees were \"a bit lazy\" when they insisted on moving slowly, a former instructor told Business Insider.\n\nBut as the British military officer helping lead the training watched them meticulously secure everything and learned why the Ukrainians were doing what they were doing, he realized it all made tactical sense. Rushing can be fatal, as a soldier could miss a trip wire, bunker, or some other danger lurking on the battlefield.\n\nMaj. Maguire, who spoke to Business Insider about his Operation Interflex experience on the condition that just his rank and last name be used, said there was a \"mindset difference\" between the Ukrainians and the British. It is distinct because Ukraine is in an existential fight with practical combat experience.\n\nFrom their experiences battling Russia, the Ukrainians had discovered that speed isn't always best; sometimes, moving slowly with patience is key to surviving the fight. Clearing a trench is an activity that demands soldiers move quickly, but others demand a slower pace, a higher degree of caution.\n\nIn an urban environment, they were fine with moving at a crawl — seizing a building and sitting on it for hours until they'd coordinated everything and fully understood their next step.\n\n\"They are very happy being slow,\" Maguire said.\n\nHe said the Ukrainians would take a long time to go through a door, \"because they will stop. They will look for wires, they will check absolutely everything on it.\" Doing all of that in a tactically safe way \"takes a long time.\"\n\nFor six months, until July 2024, Maguire led leadership training for Ukrainian soldiers who already had combat experience. His experience was the Ukrainian troops would not move on to the next house \"until they had every single potential firing hole, point, position, mine suppressed and looked after. They won't move until they've aligned the drones or the artillery behind it to do it.\"\n\nMaguire said that the British trainers were a bit impatient, as the mindset is \"you get in there, let's do it,\" but attitudes shifted as they talked to and learned from the Ukrainians. He said they realized the \"take your time\" approach was actually \"pretty good.\"\n\nThe Ukrainians have been battling Russia's full-scale invasion for years now, but fighting in eastern Ukraine has been ongoing for over a decade. Maguire said that the Ukrainians have a \"greater understanding of what it takes to win\" and a \"sheer determination\" compared to the UK armed forces.\n\n\"That's not to say the British Army doesn't have it,\" he said. But the Ukrainians he trained had come straight from \"hardcore conventional fighting,\" bringing a level of instinctive aggression and combat readiness that he said exceeded what British troops typically display, having gone years without engaging in a high-intensity conventional fight.\n\nUkraine is fighting a very different kind of war compared to those its partners in the US and across Europe have in recent decades. It's confronting one of the world's largest militaries, with massed fires, armor, and significant airpower. This war is not the counterinsurgencies Western forces have spent years preparing for.\n\nThis large-scale war, with the return of old features like trench warfare and the introduction of new tech like drones, is a far cry from what Western militaries have been focusing on. This is a clash of old and new in a brutal, grinding attritional fight.\n\nThe UK and other allies are watching the war closely, warning that Russia may attack elsewhere in Europe and spark a wider conflict. They want to understand what a fight with Russia would require, and Maguire said Interflex is teaching Western forces while it is teaching Ukrainians.\n\nInterflex has become a two-way exchange. Many of the Ukrainians going through the program have front-line experience their instructors do not. Maguire said that Ukrainian insights — including what worked against Russia — were absorbed into Interflex's curriculum and even fed back into the UK's own training programs.\n\nHe said that training sergeants who already had \"wounds of war\" was intimidating for the Western trainers. \"There are things that they are much better than us at,\" he said.\n\nInterflex has trained more than 56,000 Ukrainians, both new recruits and experienced soldiers, with support from 13 partner nations, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Lithuania.\n\nMaguire said there were many differences between the British and Ukrainian approaches, and those differences have begun to influence British thinking.\n\nHe described the Ukrainians as being \"far more comfortable in taking tactical risks\" and said the most skilled among them are \"just able to show a bit more imagination.\" That willingness to innovate and experiment, he added, is a lesson Western forces are paying attention to as the war evolves.",

    "description": "The Trump administration targeted EU figures over platform regulation, triggering backlash from Macron and digital regulators.",
    "fullText": "The US just escalated its clash with Europe over tech regulation.\n\nThe State Department said it has barred five Europeans, including the EU's former Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton and four members of digital campaign groups, from entering the country over what it called \"censorship\" of tech platforms.\n\nThe visa bans were met with backlash from European leaders on X, who accused Washington of intimidation and political overreach.\n\nThe dispute centers on the EU's Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, which imposes obligations on major tech platforms — many of which are based in the US — to police content and curb anti-competitive behavior. Companies in breach of it can be fined up to 6% of their global annual revenue.\n\nIn a post on X late Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department would block leading figures of what he called \"the global censorship-industrial complex\" from entering the US.\n\n\"For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose,\" Rubio wrote. \"The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.\"\n\nFor far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.\n\nToday, @StateDept will take steps to…\n\nIn follow-up posts on Tuesday, Sarah B. Rogers, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, named Breton among the five European individuals sanctioned, accusing him of using the EU's Digital Services Act to pressure Elon Musk and X during his tenure as commissioner for the internal market.\n\nShe also named Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, and HateAid co-CEOs Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, accusing them of pressuring US platforms over online speech. None of the four campaigners immediately responded to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nRubio added that the US was \"ready and willing to expand this list\" unless officials reversed course, framing the move as a defense of free expression and US sovereignty.\n\nThe back-and-forth has largely played out on X, a platform that was hit with a $140 million fine earlier this month for breaching the Digital Services Act.\n\nBreton responded in Tuesday X post by invoking McCarthy-era politics, asking, \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"\n\nHe added, \"To our American friends: 'Censorship isn't where you think it is.'\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also condemned the visa restrictions, describing them in a Wednesday X post as coercive measures aimed at undermining Europe's digital sovereignty.\n\n\"The rules governing the European Union's digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe European Commission \"strongly\" condemned the US decision, adding that the EU has the sovereign right to regulate its digital market and would seek clarification from US authorities.\n\nIs McCarthy’s witch hunt back? 🧹\n\nAs a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA 🇪🇺\n\nTo our American friends: “Censorship isn’t where you think it is.”\n\n\"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X on Wednesday. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"\n\nGérard Araud, France's former ambassador to the US, said the dispute reflects a deeper rupture, writing on X that \"the West\" no longer exists and that Europe is now alone in defending its interests and values.\n\nHodenberg and Ballon told Business Insider in a joint statement that they are \"not surprised\" by the move, calling it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary.\"\n\n\"Despite the significant strain and restrictions placed on us and our families by US government measures, we will continue our work with all our strength — now more than ever,\" the duo said.\n\nThe dispute has been years in the making — and Musk's X has often been at the center of it.\n\nMusk cheered the US move to sanction the officials, writing on X: \"This is so great.\"\n\nThis is so great 🤩 https://t.co/fXAfNbwEVf\n\nBreton repeatedly clashed with Musk after he bought Twitter in 2022 and pledged to loosen moderation in the name of free speech.\n\nAs the then-internal market commissioner, Breton warned that X could face fines or even be barred from the European Union if it failed to comply with EU law, later overseeing a formal investigation into the platform regarding disinformation and content moderation.\n\nThose confrontations turned X into a symbol of the broader transatlantic fight over who sets the rules for online speech — a conflict that has now spilled from regulation into geopolitics.",

    "description": "Automakers are competing to make their products more innovative and affordable.",
    "fullText": "While Xiaomi's electric vehicles aren't available in the United States, the SU7 Max is gaining attention after impressing an influential YouTube tech critic, Business Insider reported.\n\nMarques Brownlee, popularly known as MKBHD, tested the SU7 for two weeks. The EV is priced at 299,000 Chinese yuan ($42,462). \"This feels nothing like a $42,000 car,\" Brownlee said, per the outlet.\n\nWhat impressed him was the customizable interior. It comes with multiple accessory mounting points so drivers can install gadgets such as a magnetic phone mount or speedometer.\n\n\"What other car does this?\" Brownlee asked.\n\nThe influencer noted that the SU7 was a \"really capable car\" and compared it to a Tesla Model 3 or BMW i4. He said it feels like a $75,000 vehicle. A Model 3 Performance, for comparison, costs $54,990.\n\nBrownlee's surprised reaction shows how better and more affordable EVs can impact global competition. It could add pressure on established automakers to innovate and make EVs more accessible and affordable. Tesla, for example, has experienced setbacks this year, including slumping sales and a decline in November registrations in key European markets, as Reuters reported.\n\nIf you're an EV owner or are planning to switch to an EV, a home charger can increase your cost savings. Qmerit offers free, instant estimates for installing a Level 2 charger.\n\nSolar panels also help you save more as an EV owner because using your own energy for charging is more cost-effective than relying on the grid. If you're going solar, you can find trusted installers and save as much as $10,000 via Solar Explorer. You can also easily get and compare installation quotes from vetted technicians and reduce costs with help from EnergySage.\n\nQuality affordable EVs can help accelerate widespread EV adoption, which also benefits the environment. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, EVs reduce air pollution because they don't produce any tailpipe pollution, making them cleaner and more energy-efficient transportation options than gas-powered vehicles.\n\nAs automakers compete to make their products more innovative and affordable, consumers can benefit from better options and greater accessibility.\n\nWould you buy an EV made in China?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The reasons behind the crisis are multifold.",
    "fullText": "As the calendar inched toward mid-December, rain finally fell on Iran's capital of Tehran. Yet that may not be enough to prevent an evacuation amid fears that water will run out in a metropolitan area of approximately 15 million people.\n\nBefore rain fell Dec. 10, President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that Tehran residents may \"have to evacuate\" as Iran experiences its sixth consecutive year of drought.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health, called the intensity of the drought \"unprecedented in modern times,\" as reported by CNN.\n\nSome neighborhoods have lost water service for hours on end, with key water reservoir Latyan Dam less than 10% full, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe reasons behind Iran's water crisis are multifold.\n\nAs CNN and the AP detailed, years of overextraction — policies enacted after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, during which then-Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini promised free water for everyone — and the cultivation of water-intensive crops have all played significant roles. More than 90% of Iran's water goes toward agriculture.\n\nTo some degree, sanctions tied to the regime's nuclear and missile programs, human-rights abuses, and support for terrorism have also played a role, as Iranian-American and senior fellow at The Washington Institute Holly Dagres noted in a piece detailing how many Iranians see the water crisis as stemming from the regime's \"systemic mismanagement and corruption.\"\n\nA changing climate fueled by pollution from coal, oil, and gas is also influencing weather patterns in the region. While \"all extreme events have multiple causes,\" per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, warmer global temperatures are supercharging them, making them more powerful and destructive.\n\nWhile rain fell on Tehran after Pezeshkian's warning in November, Iran Meteorological Organization office official Ahad Vazifeh said he expects a shortage \"even if rain in the winter and spring will be normal,\" according to the AP.\n\nThe government has tried \"cloud seeding\" to increase rainfall. While cloud seeding has been blamed for flooding in multiple regions, scientists have regularly debunked that theory, and a recent study indicates that cloud seeding may only have a limited effect on rainfall.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

I just wasn’t sure.”\n\nHe said he believes this was not the first time his daughter had visited the property where she died. Authorities are still looking into what led Leah to fall.\n\n“We just kind of always had something in the back of our mind that something could happen,\" he explained.\n\nStill, he said, \"I’m just hoping it [the fall] was instant. I just hope she felt no pain,\" Leah's dad said.\n\nTodd said that visiting properties like the one where his daughter died is “dangerous” and suggested Leah may have been with people she “really don’t know.”\n\nAs of midday on Tuesday, Dec. 23, more than $2,500 has been raised through a GoFundMe campaign started to support Leah’s family.\n\nTom Cavanaugh, a family friend who organized the online fundraiser, said donations will go toward covering Leah’s funeral and memorial costs.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nAccording to Cavanaugh, Leah had an affinity for photography and “loved exploring and photographing abandoned buildings.”\n\n“She was a beautiful and vibrant young lady originally from Florida who lived for the beach and outdoors,” Cavanaugh wrote. “She was always the popular kid in school and got along with everybody. Her family is left absolutely heartbroken.”\n\nLeah is survived by her father, her mother and two brothers, Cavanaugh said.\n\nAn informal memorial will take place at a Kennesaw park on Tuesday, according to WAGA.",

    "description": "You need to handle all your emails one way or another—but you can be quick about it.",
    "fullText": "To manage your inbox, you need dedication. You need a plan. You need acronyms. One such acronym is RAFT, which will literally keep you afloat in the sea of emails you receive every day. You can combine it with others, like LIFO and 4D to maximize its benefits, but first you need to know what to do with it on its own.\n\nEasy! With this management system, you take the time to read an email first, then act on it however you need to—if you need to, that is—before either filing it away somewhere or deleting it. That’s basically all there is to it, but it works because it requires you to focus on each individual email and make an assessment right away, so you don’t miss anything.\n\nLike the one- and two-touch rules, this one does require you to open your emails as they come in. For me, that's the hardest part because it's a habit you need to build. This approach reminds me of a more broadly-applicable productivity technique I use often, which is the two-minute rule. When you think of something or are prompted to deal with it, handle it right away. Again, it's a habit that needs to be built up, but I like this approach for all kinds of productivity needs—and with RAFT, you have a clearly outlined series of next steps after you open it up.\n\nTo maximize the benefits, you should combine this with another system or two. For instance, combine RAFT with the LIFO—last in, first out—method, which calls for you to answer your most recent emails before older ones. If you do this, you’ll always be acting on the most urgent needs instead of playing endless catch-up with things that you let slip by. If something from the past is truly important, you’ll get a follow-up email and you can RAFT then. Otherwise, stick with your most pressing, recent messages and read them, act on them, and file or trash them after that.\n\nWhen it comes to the acting part, you can call on the trusty 4D method to help you out. The four Ds are delete, do, delegate, or defer, and they refer to the four things you can do with any email. (Delete here is redundant, since “trash” is part of RAFT, but it’s good to reinforce the notion that useless emails should be nuked.) Either do what the email says or delegate it to someone who can, but keep the process moving swiftly. If you don’t end up forwarding it to someone else, delete it or defer (file) it. The main rule of RAFT is you have to do something with every message, not ignore it.\n\nAs for the filing component of RAFT, make sure you have a great file system in place in advance. If you use Gmail, consider using labels as a more organized archive system, to make whatever you choose to file away more easily accessible. You can label these mini-archives by date, by project, or by whatever makes sense for your retrieval, but be consistent about it so you’re not just banishing all your dealt-with messages to an email limbo.",

    "description": "Filters are about to become your new best friend.",
    "fullText": "No matter how dedicated you are to responding to and archiving all your emails, there will always be one thing preventing you from hitting true inbox zero: all of those mailing lists you're subscribed to. These horrors will visit you at all hours of the day, making it harder to spot the truly important messages in your inbox—and it gets worse once you've gotten fed up enough to disable push notifications and they start to really pile up.\n\nIt’s time to banish these buggers. And, if you're using Gmail, there’s an easy way to do it.\n\nYou can use a third-party add-on to go through your mailing lists and unsubscribe, saying goodbye to newsletters and e-blasts. But you know what’s easier and less expensive? Setting a filter in Gmail.\n\nOpen up one of your mailing list emails and click the three dots in the menu bar. You’ll see “Mark as unread,” “Mark as important,” and a few other options, but the one you want is “Filter messages like these.”\n\nFrom there, you’ll see a dialog box asking how you want to filter your messages. You can filter by sender, recipients, and subjects, but also by anything that “has the words…” In the “has the words” row, type “unsubscribe.”\n\nNow, any email containing the word “unsubscribe”—which reputable email blasts almost always do—can be filtered out of your inbox without you having to do anything. Once you type “unsubscribe” there, hit the “create filter” button. The following dialog box will ask how you want these filtered. You can choose to have them archived, marked as read, starred, forwarded, or immediately deleted.\n\nI recommend archiving over deleting in case you ever want to find them again, but if you are sure you’ll never want to open another mailing list, newsletter, or sales blast, feel free to check the box next to “delete.” Note that if you choose to archive but later want to delete them, you’ll have to do so manually. Personally, I am happy to pay for extra Google storage to keep a record of messages instead of inadvertently lose something I need, but I know that's needlessly neurotic.\n\nIf you do end up archiving those, the next step needs to be actually unsubscribing from the messages you truly don't want to receive. Gmail has recently made this a lot easier: You can usually click an unsubscribe button up at the top of the offending email. The Google-run email service also rolled out a Manage Subscriptions service this past summer, so once you take a gander at the archive full of junk and notice what you're not exactly needing or opening up, you can head over there and nuke your subscriptions quickly and easily.",

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: The Origin of Christmas Elves",
    "description": "Sure, elves are hard at work at the North Pole, but how did they get there?",
    "fullText": "Because it’s Christmas time, I’ve been digging into myths and misconceptions we have about the holiday: Yuletide misinformation is rampant, and I’m setting the record straight. Last week I dug into who Santa Claus really is, with side quests about St. Nicholas bringing children back from the dead and the religious war between Santa and Kris Kringle. One thing I didn't talk about? His elves.\n\nChristmas elves feel like they’ve been around forever, and people have strangely consistent ideas of what they’re all about—they’re small, they wear green, they make toys out of some innate magical compulsion, they love shelves— but that variety of elf is a recent invention; “real” elves were often anything but jolly little pieceworkers. The elves' thousand-year transition from supernatural nightmare creatures to friendly factory workers is a cultural Rorschach test revealing Western culture's changing attitudes about work, wealth, and what it means to be a \"useful\" member of society.\n\nTo understand how we arrived at our current vision of elves, you have to rewind past Will Ferrell vehicles, Christmas specials, and Victorian holiday frippery to the colder heart of Western culture—the old, weird world that was haunted by supernatural forces, and elves weren’t creatures you’d ever want spying on your children.\n\nThe early origin of elves can’t be pinned down exactly because the idea of elves predates the written word. Magical, man-like races were mentioned in mythology and oral traditions in cultures all over the world; but elves, specifically, were common in Norse and Germanic folklore. This variety of elf was (usually) more like Legolas than Hermey from Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer—human-sized and magical, although sometimes mischievous.\n\nElves in Anglo-Saxon England, though, were jerks. Old English medical texts attributed various diseases to elves. If you felt a sharp, unexplained pain, it was probably the result of an “elfshot”—an elf firing an invisible arrow at you. Elves were also associated with witchcraft, nightmares, and mental disorders.\n\nElves did all kinds of bad things. Kind of, anyway: The names and deeds of elves, fairies, hobs and other creatures were basically interchangeable and regional, so it's hard to ascribe anything specifically to elves (it could have been a nixie or brownie, after all).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, elves/fairies/other small magic folk were known to steal people's babies, replacing them with changelings—sickly imposters left in the human’s place. They could curse your livestock, spoil your milk, or lead travelers astray in the woods. Elves were blamed when infants died suddenly or when children developed unexplained illnesses. The \"elf-lock\" was a particularly nasty bit of mischief where elves would tangle your hair into impossible knots while you slept—the bastards! In other words, these were not the kind of people who would help make toys. They were fundamentally alien—beings that operated by rules humans couldn't understand and definitely couldn't trust—and they weren't for fun or for kids. They were deadly serious and considered very real.\n\nSo how did we get from disease-causing, child-stealing nightmare creatures to Santa’s personal toy-making proletariat? By the medieval and early modern period in Britain, there is widespread belief in what I call “transitional elves.” These were household spirits that came out at night to perform chores while families slept. Useful, for sure, but these elves were mercurial and easily offended. They would leave forever if they felt insulted or taken advantage of. You couldn’t even do something nice for them—if you made them clothes, they might decide to quit forever, shouting, “Gie Brownie a coat, gie Brownie a sark, Ye'se get nae mair o' Brownie's wark.\"\n\nThese “household helper” folk beliefs often cast elves as craftsmen, one step closer to toy-makers. These stories inspired the text that laid the foundation for Christmas Elves: the Brothers Grimm fairytale “The Elves and the Shoemaker.” In that story, a shoemaker is down to his last piece of leather, but he wakes up to find a pair of elf-crafted shoes. He sells them, and continues to get free shoemaking labor until he grows wealthy. Then he makes the fateful mistake of rewarding his unpaid laborers with clothing and shoes of their own. They elves are so impressed with their classy new fits, they leave forever, seemingly because they now regard themselves as too good for a working class life. The moral: Don’t treat your employees very well, lest they think they’re your equal.\n\nAlong with establishing much of Santa’s mythology, Clement Clarke Moore's 1823 poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" (better known as \"The Night Before Christmas\") described Santa Claus himself as \"a right jolly old elf,” This line laid the foundation for the association of elves with Christmas. An 1857 poem called “The Wonders of Santa Claus” spelled it out clearly. Santa, the poem says, “keeps a great many elves at work,” making “a million of pretty things” like “cakes, sugar-plums, and toys.”\n\nIn a reflection of the industrial revolution that was happening far from the North Pole, elves weren't household spirits helping one family, they were a workforce, mass-producing toys in a factory. And in what can be seen as an expression of sentimental Victorian ideas about class, the elves loved working in a sweatshop; it's what they were born to do!\n\nHere’s the first picture of Santa’s Workshop, from Godey's Lady's Book in 1873. At the time, Godey’s had a huge circulation in the United States, and this image cemented the modern idea of Santa’s Workshop.\n\nThe 1964 Rankin/Bass TV special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer put the finishing touches on Christmas elf lore by presenting a deeper look at how the North Pole workshop operates. Perhaps fueled by growing cultural misgivings about modernization and capitalism, Santa's workshop in Rudolph is rife with vicious interoffice politics, forced conformity, workers whose dreams and ambitions are crushed (He just wanted to be a dentist, Santa!), and a boss man who is woefully out-of-touch with his employees. The only major innovation in Elf-lore since Rudolph is the \"Elf on the Shelf,\" but he's a damn snitch, so we won't talk about him.\n\nThe next time you see a green-suited helper in a Christmas movie, remember, that the jolly little toymaker was cobbled together from medieval folklore, German fairy tales, and 19th-century magazine illustrations, and shaped by the rise of industrialization. The modern elf is the domesticated, sanitized, capitalist-approved descendant of supernatural creatures that stole babies, drove people mad, and shot invisible arrows at your ancestors.

    "title": "Is Greek Yogurt or Cottage Cheese the Better Protein Pick? Here’s What Experts Say",
    "description": "From protein content to gut benefits, here’s how these two powerhouse snacks compare.",
    "fullText": "Greek yogurt is slightly richer in micronutrients, lower in lactose, and a more consistent source of probiotics, making it a great option for gut health and those with dairy sensitivities.\n\nCottage cheese edges out Greek yogurt in protein content per serving but is notably higher in sodium, which may be a concern for those watching their salt intake.\n\nBoth are nutritious, high-protein snacks that support muscle, bone, and immune health—so the “better” choice really depends on your health goals, taste preferences, and dietary needs.\n\nGreek yogurt and cottage cheese are extremely popular dairy choices—both are featured ubiquitously across social media. But beyond being tasty additions to sweet and savory recipes alike, they’re equally loved for their unique nutritional benefits.\n\nAlthough both Greek yogurt and cottage cheese are made from cow’s milk and touted as high-protein, they actually offer slightly different nutrition. Each has their place and may be a better fit for certain individuals, depending on their needs.\n\nHere, we’ll explore the ins and outs of Greek yogurt and cottage cheese—what makes them unique, the nutrition they offer, and which is a better choice when prioritizing protein intake.\n\nFirst things first, what is Greek yogurt?\n\n“Greek yogurt is made by curdling milk and then straining it multiple times to remove a significant amount of liquid whey, to result in a thicker, creamier, and much more tart yogurt than regular yogurt. In turn, it contains less lactose and is significantly higher in protein,” shares Jamie Baham, MS, RDN, LD, registered dietitian and owner of Ladybug Nutrition.\n\nJamie Baham, MS, RDN, LD, registered dietitian and owner of Ladybug Nutrition\n\nAli McGowan, MS, RD, LDN, a Boston-based registered dietitian\n\nFor a deeper look into Greek yogurt’s nutrition, here’s the nutrient breakdown, according to the USDA Database:\n\nPlain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt (100 grams, around ½ cup)\n\nMacronutrients\nCalories: 95 calories\nProtein: 9 grams (g)\nTotal Carbohydrates: 5 g\nFat: 4.4 g\n Saturated Fat: 2.4 g\n\nMicronutrients\nRiboflavin (Vitamin B2): 0.24 milligrams (mg), 19 percent of Daily Value (% DV)*\nVitamin B12: 0.8 micrograms (mcg), 33% DV\nVitamin A: 38 mcg, 5% DV\nCalcium: 111 mg, 11% DV\nZinc: 0.5 mg, 5% DV\nPhosphorus: 126 mg, 10% DV\nSelenium: 9.7 mcg, 18% DV\nSodium: 34 mg, 2% DV\n\nAdditionally, you can also expect Greek yogurt to offer plenty of probiotics. Otherwise, this nutritional analysis tells us a lot about how Greek yogurt can benefit overall health. “It delivers high-quality protein, probiotics for gut health, and key nutrients like calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and vitamins A, B2, and B12,” explains Ali McGowan, MS, RD, LDN, a Boston-based registered dietitian. These nutrients combine to support muscle, tissue, bone, heart, immune, gut, and metabolic health.\n\nAnd given that Greek yogurt is lower in lactose than regular yogurt, it may be an especially smart choice for those sensitive to lactose. “For my patients who are lactose intolerant, Greek yogurt is also a safer option when testing tolerance with yogurt, since it tends to be lower in lactose than milk, regular yogurt, and even ice cream,” shares Baham. “Plus, the live and active cultures in Greek yogurt help further break down the lactose, making it even easier to digest.”\n\nMaybe the only concern surrounding this dairy product is its saturated fat content. While some research shows full-fat dairy, like yogurt, to not be linked to higher cholesterol or heart disease risk, other studies tie saturated fat to increased cholesterol levels, in turn upping cardiovascular disease risk. However, the fermentation process involved in Greek yogurt (and cottage cheese) thankfully converts some of its saturated fat into heart-healthy unsaturated fats, further quelling this concern.\n\n“Fermented dairy, like Greek yogurt, has been associated with benefits for bone, metabolic, and immune health,” McGowan concludes.\n\nEver trendy on social media, many of us likely are pretty familiar with cottage cheese. However, if you’re not, “cottage cheese is a soft, fresh cheese made from curdled milk,” explains McGowan. “It’s made by acidifying milk, which separates the whey from the curds,” Baham adds, with those curds going on to become cottage cheese.\n\nHere’s a closer look at cottage cheese nutrition, according to the USDA:\n\nPlain Cottage Cheese, Full Fat (100 grams, around ½ cup)\n\nMacronutrients\nCalories: 105 calories\nProtein: 12 grams (g)\nTotal Carbohydrates: 5 g\nFat: 4.2 g\n Saturated Fat: 2.6 g\n\nMicronutrients\nRiboflavin (Vitamin B2): 0.16mg, 13% DV\nVitamin B12: 0.7 micrograms (mcg), 29% DV\nVitamin A: 36 mcg, 5% DV\nCalcium: 88 mg, 9% DV\nZinc: 0.45 mg, 5% DV\nPhosphorus: 154 mg, 12% DV\nSelenium: 9.7 mcg, 18% DV\nSodium: 350 mg, 18% DV\n\nCertain brands of cottage cheese also contain digestion-supporting probiotics—but not all of them. “Generally, cottage cheese is rich in casein—a slow-digesting protein that helps with satiety and muscle repair—and provides calcium, selenium, and B vitamins,” shares McGowan. Speaking of B vitamins, “this protein-packed dairy food is also a great source of riboflavin (B2), which plays a key antioxidant role in reducing cell damage,” Baham adds.\n\nUltimately, cottage cheese is pretty darn similar to Greek yogurt in terms of health benefits. “Like Greek yogurt, it’s a nutrient-dense, high-protein option that can support bone health and weight management,” McGowan summarizes—alongside championing energy metabolism and gut, heart, and immune health.\n\nBut this brings us to the question, which of these dairy products is actually better for you?\n\nWhile the numbers are very similar, Greek yogurt offers slightly more micronutrients pretty much across the board compared to cottage cheese, with the exception of phosphorus and sodium. It’s also slightly lower in calories, a more reliable source of probiotics, and generally lower in lactose. There’s virtually no difference between the fat and saturated fat content of the two dairy products.\n\nThe sodium in cottage cheese, however, is not to be overlooked, as one small half cup serving provides almost a fifth of your daily allowance of the mineral—and most of us eat more than half a cup in one sitting. While cottage cheese might be the only high-sodium food one has in a day, that’s often not the case—and prolonged excessive sodium intake can lead to elevated blood pressure levels over time.\n\nBut when deciding which of the two is the better high-protein snack, cottage cheese technically wins, as it boasts three more grams per serving.\n\nThat said, they’re both excellent choices that offer protein, calcium, and a range of other beneficial micronutrients. “‘Better’ really depends on the individual and their specific health goals,” Baham agrees. “If you’re trying to reduce your protein intake—like in the case of chronic kidney disease, for example—a dollop of Greek yogurt will be lower in protein than a dollop of cottage cheese. If you’re trying to increase your calcium intake, Greek yogurt tends to be higher per serving than cottage cheese,” she adds.\n\nTaste preference plays a role here, too. “It also comes down to what you enjoy. Greek yogurt contains probiotics and has a tangy, smooth texture, while cottage cheese offers a milder taste and chunkier consistency,” says McGowan.\n\nRegardless of which dairy option you choose, plain varieties are always the best picks to avoid sneaky pro-inflammatory added sugars. Also be sure to look for cottage cheese that contains probiotics (usually advertised on the packaging).\n\nWith your plain Greek yogurt and cottage cheese, the culinary possibilities are nearly endless. “I love adding Greek yogurt to boost the probiotics and protein in my smoothies, or using it as a substitute for sour cream or mayo in my homemade dressings, whereas I like to use cottage cheese in both savory and sweet dishes like tasty dips, fluffy pancakes, and even homemade ice cream to reduce fat and added sugars,” shares Baham.\n\nMeanwhile, McGowan loves “adding fruit, nuts, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, or spices like cinnamon or Everything Bagel seasoning for extra flavor to either Greek yogurt or cottage cheese.”\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s hard to go wrong with either dairy choice, as both Greek yogurt and cottage cheese offer a range of beneficial nutrients and satiating protein, sure to keep you energized throughout the day.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Windows Power User Should Know",
    "description": "Time for a Windows power up.",
    "fullText": "For many students and workers, Windows is just the default way to use a computer. It's where all your apps work as intended, where all your Microsoft Office documents sync easily, and where you play all your games. But if you peel back its layers, Windows can be a lot more than that. Power users can take advantage of hidden features, and utilities from Microsoft and third-parties to not only speed up their workflow, but to improve productivity and fix some of the most annoying quality-of-life issues that plague Windows PCs.\n\nFor decades, Mac users have boasted about Spotlight Search, while Windows never really offered a true alternative. Windows Search is fast, but it's never really come close to replicating all the things Spotlight can do, especially now with the latest macOS Tahoe update. Finally, after years of waiting, Microsoft has introduced its own keyboard launcher, called Command Palette.\n\nIt's not available by default, though. To find it, you'll have to install PowerToys, which is Microsoft's own set of handy utilities. Once PowerToys is running, find the Command Palette app from the sidebar, and enable it. Then, you can access it using the default keyboard shortcut, which is Windows + Alt + Space (you can customize this be whatever you like).\n\nOnce it's set up, you can use the Command Palette to launch apps, search for files, open folders, switch between apps, open bookmarked websites or folders, and search the web. In fact, you can even run Terminal commands from here, and you can use extensions to add features. Here's a detailed guide on the Command Palette to get you started.\n\nThe File Explorer in Windows 11 is a certified mess. It's slower than the Windows 10 version, and it's harder to find your way around it. If you're as frustrated by this as I am, try installing the Files app instead. It's an $8 app on the Microsoft Store, but can be downloaded for free from the developer's website.\n\nThe Files app is beautifully designed, with support for theme colors. The app has a simple interface with an easy to access sidebar, tabs, dual-pane mode, and a dark mode that actually looks good. There's also a column view from macOS and an ability to preview files without opening them.\n\nThe Windows 11 update radically redesigned the taskbar and the Start menu. If you don't like the new updates, there is a way to go back. You can install the free ExplorerPatcher app to revert back to the Windows 10 Taskbar, with full-length app names, along with the older Start menu. If you only want to change the existing Start menu (I don't blame you), try the Start 11 app, which costs $9.99 for a single license and a year's worth of upgrades. Start11 is an incredibly customizable Start menu replacement where you can customize everything from the layout, spacing, icon color, size, and more. You can even go back to the Windows 10 style layout, but with the look of the Windows 11 icons.\n\nIf you've swapped from Mac to Windows, and you miss the Mac's Dock and menu bar, you can get them on Windows using the free and open source Seelen UI app. It's an app that uses web technologies to add a menu bar and a floating Dock to your screen. It also hides the Windows Taskbar by default.\n\nSeelen is completely customizable with community themes and plugins. You can choose where to keep the taskbar, and you can make it transparent if you want (something Windows 11 doesn't allow for). You can add community themes to completely transform how it looks and works. You can also add more features using plugins.\n\nThe dark mode in Windows is woefully lacking, especially compared to macOS. As a power user, you might prefer to spend most of your time in dark mode, or you might want to automatically switch to dark mode as evening kicks in. By default, Windows doesn't offer any such features. You have to go deep into Settings to enable or disable the dark theme, and that's it.\n\nMicrosoft has a PowerToys utility called Light Switch that can solve some of those issues. With the Light Switch utility enabled, you can automatically trigger the dark theme at the time of sunset, or or a schedule that you like. Plus, it gives you a global shortcut to trigger the dark theme on the fly.\n\nSnap Layouts is a powerful hidden feature in Windows 11 that not many people use. You might be used to dragging the left edge on a window to dock it to the left half of the screen. Well, that's just part of the Snap Layouts feature. Next time you want to arrange the windows on your screen, drag the window to the top edge, and you'll see a new preview of all possible layout options. You can easily split your large monitor screen into three or four windows, without doing any heavy lifting. You can also access this feature by hovering over the Maximize button, or you can use the Windows + Z keyboard shortcut to bring up the Snap Layout menu.\n\nInstalling apps on Windows can sometimes be its own special nightmare. You have to deal with installation wizards with dozens of steps, some of which haven't been updated since Windows XP days. Like Linux and macOS, Windows too has a hidden package manager called Winget, a repository of apps that can be downloaded with just a single command. Yes, you need to open the Terminal to do it, but it's really not that hard. Say you want to install Chrome: You'll enter this in the Terminal and in a couple of seconds, the Chrome browser will be installed and ready to go, without a single extra click.\n\nDon't like using the command line? Well there's a GUI app for you. With the UniGetUI app, you can search for all apps or packages in the Windows Package Manager list, and download them in one click. There's also a one-click option for updating all WinGet apps at once.\n\nWindows has a built-in clipboard manager that you really should be using. Press Windows + V to bring up the Clipboard History (the first time you do this, you'll have to enable this feature). Now, every time you copy anything on Windows, it will be stored in this list. You can go back to the Clipboard Manager at any time to copy one or multiple items from this list. You can even pin something to the top of the list, or quickly clear all history. If you're looking for a bit more, try the Ditto app. It lets you customize how many snippets you store in your clipboard at a given time, and has a capable fast Search feature built-in.\n\nThere's a Focus Session feature inside the Clock app that's basically a built-in Pomodoro timer, with distraction-free features. You can start a Focus timer for, let's say, 30 minutes, and during that time Windows will stop all unnecessary notifications and app alerts so you can focus on your task. After a longer session, you'll also be prompted to take a break.\n\nPower users rely on keyboard shortcuts to not only speed things up but also to reduce mental overload. Once you have the muscle memory, using a keyboard shortcut to perform frequent tasks reduces a lot of friction (especially compared to hunting for buttons using a mouse). When you start using an app, spend some time trying to learn keyboard shortcuts for the most frequently used actions. For example, archiving mail, exporting documents, and so on.\n\nBut this gets more interesting once you start to remap your keys and keyboard shortcuts using the Keyboard Manager utility inside PowerToys. Here, click the Remap a Key button to get started. Now, you can map any unused key, like your Caps Lock key, or the Copilot key, to anything else (like a shortcut to bring up Command Palette, for example). Or you can remap the shortcut for Copy from Control + C, to Windows + C. Time to get creative!",

    "title": "This Hidden Spotify Feature Makes the Best Personalized Playlists",
    "description": "It's like Tinder, but for songs.",
    "fullText": "Spotify playlists are a surprisingly big part of my life. I make a handful of new, curated, choreographed ones for the spin classes I teach every week and otherwise meticulously maintain quarterly playlists designed to represent the overall vibe of specific, three-month periods in my life. I only edit those during the 12 weeks of the quarter, then leave them alone so I can revisit them and relive the era. This means I am constantly fiddling with the present playlist to make it just right, searching for songs that feel precisely aligned with however I'm feeling. It's actually a time-consuming hobby—but I stumbled across a feature the other day that has made creating spin playlists and soundtracking Q1 of 2026 easier than ever.\n\nThe best way I can describe the feature I stumbled upon is that it's like Tinder for songs. If you're listening to a song within the app, scroll down. Go past the buttons for Play and Next, past the About the artist section, past the lyrics, and stop when you see Explore [artist name]. Then, you'll have three options like Similar to [artist name] and Similar to [song name], but these can differ slightly.\n\nTapping one of those opens up the new feature. Say you choose Similar to [song name]. You'll be given 30 seconds of a song that Spotify's algorithm considers \"similar\" to the one you were just listening to, plus the artist's name, how many Spotify followers they have, and a three-dot menu that will let you add the song to your likes, add it to a playlist, go to the artist's page, and more. If you like the 30-second clip, you can add the song to your playlists. If not, you can keep swiping downward to hear a new one.\n\nSee how it's like Tinder? You make fairly snap decisions based on the quick preview and few details you get, then swipe away if you don't like it. I found a community forum post on Spotify's website about it, but otherwise, not much chatter. All I can tell is that it's been out since about May.\n\nI prefer this to the other music-discovery options on Spotify because it gives you a quick preview of the song and makes the finding process simple. I am, of course, a big fan of the pre-generated Discover Weekly playlist or New Releases playlist Spotify makes for me every week, but it's time-consuming to listen to all the songs in them and it's not intuitive to find other new songs based on the finite playlists themselves. The 30-second quick hits and easy, swipeable dismissal of the new feature help me figure out if a song is worth my time, either for spin class or personal use, add it to the appropriate playlist if so, and keep moving.\n\nWhat I especially like is the three hashtags under the artist's name. They are genre descriptions that match up with whatever song you're previewing and I've found them helpful because I have a hard time describing what kind of music I even like. Apparently, per the new feature, I like something called \"speed garage.\" Tapping the #speedgarage hashtag that appears in the song previews brings me to another scrollable preview pane full of, exclusively, more speed garage—whatever that actually is. I still can't define it, but I learned I like it, and that alone is more beneficial than a year's worth of Discover Weekly playlists.\n\nI used this feature during my Uber ride to the airport the other day and, by the time I was through TSA, I had 29 new songs in my Q1 playlist. I listened to them on the plane, weeded out ones that didn't match the quarterly vibe well enough, then sent it to my friends, who all gave the collection rave reviews like, and I quote, \"this slaps.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has attributed the recent uptick in the unemployment rate to a reduction in government jobs. He also highlighted that all new jobs are being created in the private sector.\n\nTrump, during the Most Favored Nation drug pricing press conference on Friday, acknowledged the rise in the unemployment rate but emphasized that “the only reason” it happened was due to a significant decrease in government jobs.\n\nHe underscored that the reduction of government jobs has been unprecedented and will continue. The president explained that the federal workforce had “millions and millions” of people having jobs who “never even showed up.”\n\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\n\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nTrump further claimed that he “could reduce unemployment to 2%,1% or practically zero by just hiring people” into the federal government, even though these jobs are unnecessary. “We don’t need 10 people to fill one job,” he stated.\n\nThe president stated, “100% of our new jobs are in the private sector. So this is for the last number of months…That’s the way to make America great again.”\n\nTrump also suggested that the private sector job growth would further improve with the ongoing construction of new buildings, AI, and auto plants across the country.\n\nTrump’s comments come on the heels of the U.S. labor market showing signs of cooling in November as job growth narrowly met already subdued expectations, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high.\n\nU.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 64,000 in November, driven by stronger-than-expected private-sector hiring, which added 69,000 jobs, as Trump highlighted.\n\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nHowever, a 5,000-job drop in government employment offset some of the gains, keeping overall job growth muted. The reduction in the overall federal workforce comes due to the government shutdown as well as Trump’s sweeping job cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nLeading economists and experts have raised concerns about the slowing U.S. labor market following the release of the November data. Economist Justin Wolfers said it is unclear whether the economy is already in a recession, but noted that employment trends point to a clear slowdown. He also stated that the economy created “zero jobs” since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs. However, Wolfers’ claims could not be confirmed by data.",

Julia Barten, a physical therapist at the Stanford Pelvic Health Center, calls these “unicorn poops” or “no wipers.”\n\nHealth: Do You Have 'Ghost Poops'? Here's What That Says About Your Health.\n\nWhy? “Because the stool is so well formed that there’s no remnant fecal matter left behind when you wipe,” she said.\n\nIn other words: They’re the perfect poo. Here’s what causes ghost poops — and what they say about your overall health:\n\nIf you take a look at the Bristol Stool Scale, a visual chart that classifies bowel movements, ghost poops qualify as a Type 4 poo, Barten said. Though there may be no evidence left in the pot, your poop might look like a piece of sausage that’s smooth and soft. “I would consider that to be an absolutely perfect poop,” Barten said.\n\nDr. Ira Leeds, a Yale Medicine colorectal surgeon, said ghost poops — or nirvana poops, as he calls them — easily (but noticeably) pass through the anal canal, sink to the bottom of the toilet, and leave no residue when wiping. These three factors are indicative of good bowel health.\n\nHealth: I'm An ER Physician. Here Are 5 Types Of Pain I'd Never Ignore.\n\nA bowel movement that easily moves through the anal canal typically has an ideal consistency, according to Leeds. As such, you don’t have to push as hard. This, in turn, minimizes straining and toilet time, which can both lead to complications like hemorrhoids and anal fissures, he explained.\n\nFloating poops typically have a higher fat content, which causes them to stay on the surface of the water. But when your poop sinks? This suggests your digestion is functioning well.\n\n“Fats, proteins and carbohydrates are being broken down properly into their constitutive parts that can be used by the body effectively,” Leeds said.\n\nFinally, seeing a lot of residue on the toilet paper when wiping could mean you have an underlying health issue. According to Leeds, if you have to wipe at least three times, you may want to investigate. While your diet may be to blame (more on that below), excess wiping can occur if you have hemorrhoids, fissures, chronic itching, or an anal fistulae, Leeds noted.\n\nHealth: Here's How To Tell If You're Still Contagious After Being Sick\n\nThere are multiple factors that can impact the consistency of your poop such as diet, your stress levels along with how much you sleep and exercise.\n\nIf you want to improve your gut health, Barten recommended starting with dietary changes. In general, a high-fiber diet will bulk up your stool so that it looks like the Type 4 poo on that Bristol Stool Scale. Aim to consume 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The more fiber you eat, the better your stool consistency will be, the easier it’ll be to go to the bathroom, and the less toilet paper you’ll need, Leeds said.\n\nMany people have food sensitivities and intolerances. So, it’s worth being aware of how you react to various foods and drinks. The reason: “Avoiding foods that irritate your gut is important for having well-formed stools,” Barten said.\n\nEvidence also shows that exercise can improve your bowel movements. “Regular cardiovascular exercise improves nervous system regulation and movement literally helps things move better — our joints, our muscles and our bowels,” Barten said. The CDC suggests getting 150 minutes of exercise each week, but even small bursts of activity, like going on a short stroll, can boost your gut health.\n\nHealth: Experts Say ‘Upwards Of 60% Of The World’ Lacks This 1 Vitamin — And It Increases Your Risk Of Getting Sick\n\nFinally, prioritize your sleep (aim for seven to eight hours of shut-eye each night) and do your best to manage your stress. “Our gut is our emotional center,” Barten said.\n\nThere’s a strong mind-gut connection that significantly impacts gut motility. Barten’s advice? Don’t skimp out on self-care. Carve out some time, every day if you can, to relax and do the things you love. “It’s essential to achieve satisfying bowel movements,” she said.\n\nIf Your Poop Looks Like This, It's Time To See A Doctor\n\nTikTok Claims Pooping With Your Hair Down Can Cause Breakouts.

    "title": "How Reliable Are Volkswagens? Here's What Consumer Reports Says",
    "description": "Consumer Reports amasses quite a bit of data about automotive manufacturers and surveys owners about reliability. Here's how Volkswagen currently ranks.",
    "fullText": "Volkswagen is one of the oldest and biggest car manufacturers in the world. For almost nine decades, the brand has lived through the early dominance of the Beetle, its rise as an automotive giant through acquisitions of Audi and Porsche, and, more recently, Dieselgate. VW's modern car lineup includes compact cars, SUVs, crossovers, and electric vehicles like the Volkswagen ID Buzz, which has the best vibes of any new car on sale. Within this large lineup of cars, specs and features vary — but how reliable are Volkswagens in general?\n\nAccording to a Consumer Reports (CR) 2025 reliability survey ranking 26 different major brands, Volkswagen ranks 16th. The Golf GTI is the most reliable model in the current VW lineup, while the compact Taos ranks as the least reliable. These numbers place VW slightly below average. RepairPal ranks VW reliability numbers at 3.5 out of 5.0, which puts it as 12th across 32 different brands. These numbers tell you something, but not everything. Individual cars can perform very differently, so buyer beware: Picking the right VW model matters.\n\nThe ratings CR provides are based on real owner experiences in the past 12 months. Specifically, CR compiled data on 380,000 vehicles and separated that data into 20 different trouble areas that include the engine, transmission, in-car electronics, body hardware, and EV components. According to CR, the Taos \"is less reliable than other cars from the same model year.\" It isn't all bad ratings for Volkswagen, though.\n\nRepairPal is an independent automotive data company that bases its reliability ratings on millions of real-world repair invoices, historical statistics, and predictive data modeling. Based on their assessments, the Jetta, Golf, and Passat are \"above average\" in reliability, while the Tiguan and the Golf GTI are \"average.\" To further complicate things, the picture shifts slightly when looking at used cars. In a separate 2025 CR study of used car reliability, Volkswagen is placed 13th out of 26 brands.\n\nThat placement isn't a complete game changer, but it's a bit better than VW's rating with new vehicles. In another hit to VW, a dependability study from J.D. Power that tracks reliability ratings for cars up to three years of age, placed Volkswagen at the very bottom of all brands, with an average of 285 problems across 100 vehicles. However, VW Jetta reliability is rated \"Great\" while the Golf GTI is only \"Average.\" The Taos — one of the least satisfying SUVs you can buy – is also \"Average.\"\n\nVolkswagen is a major player in the U.S. car market, consistently ranking among the top-selling automotive brands. More than 10 years after the PR disaster that was Dieselgate, Volkswagen sold 316,504 vehicles in the U.S. in 2024 — a 19.4% year‑over‑year increase — suggesting that, despite its underwhelming projected reliability and past scandals, VW is a strong choice with buyers.\n\nVW's best-selling models with U.S. buyers are the Tiguan, the Atlas, and the Jetta. The usual benefit VW enjoys compared to its German counterparts is that it offers German engineering at a cheaper price. VW does not match Mercedes, Audi, and BMW in terms of luxury, despite some higher-end models, but it does share some of its platforms with Audi. This means that Volkswagen, although it isn't as premium as Mercedes or BMW, does not suffer from costs typically associated with luxury brands.\n\nAccording to RepairPal, the average annual repair costs for a VW are $676. Compared to premium brands like BMW at $968 and Audi at $987, Volkswagens seem like a practical choice, especially if you are worried about long-term repair costs. On the economy-side of the spectrum, Toyota, the brand with the best-selling passenger car of 2025, averages $441 in annual repair costs.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order — which also targeted 14 other individuals — could not be applied to him.\n\nThe decision marked the administration’s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump’s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of “improper political retribution” that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.\n\nThe March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was “no longer in the national interest.” The list included targets of Trump’s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.\n\nThe action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded — or at least tried to — against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.\n\nZaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.\n\n\"This court joins the several others in this district that have enjoined the government from using the summary revocation of security clearances to penalize lawyers for representing people adverse to it,\" Ali wrote in his order.\n\nAli emphasized that his order does not prevent the government from revoking or suspending Zaid’s clearance for reasons independent of the presidential memorandum and through normal agency processes. The preliminary injunction does not go into effect until January 13.\n\nZaid said in a statement, “This is not just a victory for me, it’s an indictment of the Trump administration’s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

    "fullText": "Chi Onwurah speaks out after Marco Rubio accused five Europeans, including two Britons, of ‘seeking to suppress American viewpoints they oppose’\n\nA senior Labour MP has accused the Trump administration of undermining free speech after Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, announced sanctions against two British anti-disinformation campaigners.\n\nChi Onwurah, the chair of parliament’s technology select committee, criticised the US government hours after it announced “visa-related” sanctions against five Europeans, including Imran Ahmed and Clare Melford.\n\nAhmed leads the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), while Melford is chief executive of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), both of which have clashed directly with Elon Musk, the owner of X and a former adviser to the US president.\n\nOnwurah said on Wednesday: “Banning people because you disagree with what they say undermines the free speech the administration claims to seek.\n\n“We desperately need a wide ranging debate on whether and how social media should be regulated in the interests of the people. Imran Ahmed gave evidence to the select committee’s inquiry into social media, algorithms and harmful content, and he was an articulate advocate for greater regulation and accountability.\n\n“Banning him won’t shut down the debate, too many people are being harmed by the spread of digital hate.”\n\nHer comments came after Rubio accused the five – who also include the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton – of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.\n\nSarah Rogers, an official at the state department, posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”\n\nThe CCDH has previously incurred the wrath of Musk over its reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took over the platform. Musk tried unsuccessfully to sue the organisation last year, before calling it a “criminal organisation”.\n\nThe X owner has also called for the GDI to be shut down over its criticism of rightwing websites for spreading disinformation. And he has railed against the EU’s Digital Services Act, which Breton helped spearhead, and under which X was hit with a €120m (£105m) fine for what the EU called the deceptive design of its blue tick system for verifying users.\n\nMelford is UK-based, while Ahmed, whose organisation once employed Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, as a director, lives in Washington DC with his family.\n\nA spokesperson for GDI called the sanctions “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship”. They added: “The Trump administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful and un-American.”\n\nAhmed has been approached for comment.\n\nA British government spokesperson said: “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content.”\n\nThat response contrasted, however, with the more combative stance taken by the French government and the European Commission.\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, said the measures “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty”. The commission said in a statement it “strongly condemns” the actions of the Trump administration.\n\nJonathan Hall, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told Times Radio: “[This] will send a really massive chilling effect on everyone else who’s discussing the subject [internet regulation] at the moment.”\n\nCampaigners in the UK warned the British government was likely to be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.\n\nAva Lee, the executive director of People Vs Big Tech, said: “The Trump administration is escalating its attacks on Europeans trying to uphold the rule of law when it comes to big tech. With the Online Safety Act (OSA), the UK is likely to be next in the firing line.”\n\nThe Trump administration has previously flagged its concerns about the OSA. This year a group of officials from the state department met Ofcom, the regulator charged with overseeing the act, and are understood to have raised concerns that the act will risk infringing free speech.\n\nBeeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK’s House of Lords and a prominent online safety campaigner, said Rubio’s comments on the visa bans were an “outrage”.\n\n“The US tech sector, backed by the US administration, is attempting to undermine European laws and values,” she said.",

    "fullText": "In this week’s newsletter: Pushing Buttons readers on their favourite games of the year, from Death Stranding 2 and Arc Raiders to Ghost of Yōtei and more\n\nHappy holidays, Pushing Buttons readers! Once again, we are approaching the cherished time of year between Christmas and New Year when we might actually have the time to play some video games. I hope Santa brought you something new to play, instead of taking one look at all the unplayed games in your Steam library and putting you straight on the naughty list.\n\nOver the past few weeks you have been sending in your favourite games of the year. I maintain that you readers have excellent taste: there’s crossover with our own Guardian games of the year list, but also plenty here that I haven’t played myself. Thank you to everyone who sent in a recommendation, and I hope you find yet another game to add to your pile of shame among the following suggestions. I’ll be back next week with a year-in-review issue – in the meantime, go enjoy yourselves!\n\n“Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I absolutely devoured this gem of a game; the story, setting, music, characters and visuals are all on point. I was itching to get back to playing it, while simultaneously never wanting it to end. Fantastic work from a debuting Sandfall Interactive [game] – I can’t wait to see what they do next!” Jen Baker\n\n“Death Stranding 2 is a true masterpiece of a game. Absurd at times, deeply emotional, scary, all with an absolutely amazing score. The characters are superb. In particular, Rainy was absolutely wonderful and Higgs, the guitar-shredding Paul Gilbert look-alike villain, was insanely brilliant. And blimey ... the graphics. Just sensational stuff.” Simon White\n\n“Avowed. I’ve started but never finished Skyrim (or any of the Elder Scrolls games), Starfield, any of the Fallouts or Outer Worlds that I think fall into the same category. But Avowed got its hooks into me with a great script and voice acting, seeing the difference my choices made and possibly the best first person, non-shooter combat I’ve tried.” Matt Froggatt\n\n“Split Fiction is the most fun co-op I have played for ages, they have ripped off every genre going and all for the greater co-op good! Plus, it’s not an expensive game and you don’t have to buy two copies. PS: The pigs and hotdog section was beyond funny!” Simon Watson\n\n“My favourite game this year has to be a triumphant return to the Lies of P universe and the DLC, Overture. It was so brilliantly done, the storyline was so sad and thoughtful. I just loved the way the prequel developed the main game lore and explained the characters backstories so well. The boss fights were so epic and I loved how stupidly hard some of them were. Oh, and the new music was great too. Big fan.” Tara Cooper\n\n“My favourite game of the year has been my favourite for years: Ghost of Yōtei. It looks incredible, the gameplay is fluid and the story is good. There are loads of side missions but they never feel like a chore or repetitive because of the quality of the action. In short, it’s everything that Assassin’s Creed wishes it could be.” Gareth Jones\n\n“Mechabellum. This game was catapulted into my online friend group seemingly out of nowhere, but we all love it. It’s a round-based 1v1 or 2v2 autobattler with lots of layers of skill and strategy. A match is about 20 mins 1v1. It’s also not an RTS which is great for me and my late-30s lads who mostly can’t put in the hours to stay good at Dota (our old go-to for Friday night games).” Thomas Jones\n\n“The top VR game of 2025 has to be Ghost Town by Fireproof Games. It has an incredible narrative with a strong female lead that is set in the 1980s. Fireproof Games is known for The Room series, so it’s no surprise that the visuals are stunning, the puzzles challenging and creative and the characters brilliant. An absolute joy to play.” Martina Stender\n\n“For me, it has to be Monster Train 2! The perfect rogue-like card battler that has learned and applied everything it can from other greats. It’s a mix of chance and strategy that never feels like it leaves you too high and dry, and challenge modes that help you find new ways to play in the main game. A wonderful, addictive and fun way to while away an afternoon, or a late night!” Nell Guy\n\n“Maybe it’s recency bias, but Arc Raiders has come out of nowhere and completely taken over my gaming life. The sound design, the significant risk of death, but also the surprisingly kind community – I’m using public voice chat for the first time since the 360 days – have combined for an immersive experience unlike anything I’ve ever played. We’ll see how the community evolves over time, especially as the game increases in popularity, but for now, it stands as a tremendous accomplishment that deserves to be recognised.” Brett Bates\n\n“One game I played this year will stay with me for life: Chicory: A Colorful Tale, an old-Zelda-like where the gameplay is based on painting every stage and interacting with colours. It’s fun to play, never tiring, an amazingly well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way, incredible music by Lena Raine ... [I] cried multiple times, had fun from start to finish, and I left no screen in black and white.” Silvano Cardin\n\n“Absolum. I was quite excited for this one since playing the demo, so not entirely unexpected that this is my favourite release of the year. A rogue-like beat-’em up where style and substance are dealt out in massive quantities; the tight mechanics and setting are so striking that even after 100%-ing the game, I’m still coming back for more. I really look forward to hearing what the developers have next for this, as they have promised more, and I am waiting with bated breath!” Asher Alexander\n\n“There were many great games this year and I’ve spent a lot of time on Silksong and Clair Obscur Expedition 33. Nothing had me obsessed like Blue Prince, though … it got to the point where I was constantly thinking about it, even when I was not playing. I’m thoroughly done, and it makes me really sad.” Marie-Jill Landry\n\n“Kaizen Game Works’ Promise Mascot Agency is a weirdly wholesome game about a Yakuza hitman rebuilding a small Japanese town through the use of incredibly odd store brand mascots. Just unique, and a perfect follow-up to the equally weird Paradise Killer.” Paul Jones\n\n“My favourite game of the year is, very much, Dispatch – and I can’t wait for the final episodes to drop tonight. It’s unique, as far as I’ve seen, with a great blend of story and game, with a compelling narrative that keeps you going with interesting decision points. The animation is great, and I’m sure I’ll replay it as soon as I’ve finished to see what differences the other choices make. And it was cheap – no need to pay £70-80 for this!” Chris Cunliffe\n\n“Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is outstanding in all respects. It’s my game of the year – all-time favourite.” Bob Watkins\n\nKarts, cakes and karaoke: the eight best party games to play with family this Christmas\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate – the least bad Terminator game in a long while | ★★★☆☆\n\nCall of Duty’s Vince Zampella was a video games visionary\n\n‘I plugged in Zelda and everything changed’: developers share their fondest Christmas gaming memories\n\nWe’ll skip the reader question this week – instead, why not get in touch to let us know what you’ve enjoyed about Pushing Buttons this year, what we could do better, and any games, themes or stories you want us to look into in 2026?\n\nYou know what to do: email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "John Fugelsang and Pope Leo XIV remind us that Christian nationalism and capitalism get in the way of the message of the season.\n\nAs John Fugelsang, who runs the risk of becoming this era’s ablest political commentator, reminds us, “The Christmas economy depends on people buying possessions to celebrate the birthday of the man who renounced possessions.”\n\nThe author of this year’s best-selling objection to the abuses of religion and politics by right-wing Christian nationalists, Separation of Church and Hate: A Sane Person’s Guide to Taking Back the Bible from Fundamentalists, Fascists, and Flock-Fleecing Frauds, Fugelsang is a decent and good-humored fellow who has no desire to snow on our Christmas fun. He simply wants to remind us of biblical entreaties that tend to be lost on right-wing zealots who claim—as President Donald Trump has—that “Christianity is under tremendous siege” by liberal do-gooders.\n\n“Jesus consistently sided with the underdogs, not the privileged and powerful,” writes Fugelsang. “Broad-minded, tolerant, and way too inclusive for the ultraconservatives of his day, the Nazarene modeled generosity and selflessness, and told his followers to share their resources and prioritize the well-being of other people over personal gain.”\n\nJesus stood up to…the authoritarians among then religious leaders, drunk on their own eminence.\n\nThe wealthy, worshiping their own stature and possessions while denying the suffering of the poor.\n\nThe capitalists in the temple, greedily exploiting poor believers.\n\nThe imperial government of Rome, whose hunger for power led to its own collapse.\n\nThose who imagine that this is too militant an interpretation of the gospels might consider the Gospel of Matthew, with its charge: “For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:”\n\nOr they might turn to the messages of Pope Leo XIV, who has carried forward the work of his predecessor Pope Francis, by asserting the importance of the Catholic Church’s “preferential option for the poor.” Leo wrote in his first apostolic exhortation, “God has a special place in his heart for those who are discriminated against and oppressed, and he asks us, his church, to make a decisive and radical choice in favor of the weakest.”\n\nThe bluntness with which the new pope has challenged the excesses of capitalism has drawn global comment—not all of it favorable. The pope has argued:\n\nA concrete commitment to the poor must also be accompanied by a change in mentality that can have an impact at the cultural level. In fact, the illusion of happiness derived from a comfortable life pushes many people towards a vision of life centered on the accumulation of wealth and social success at all costs, even at the expense of others and by taking advantage of unjust social ideals and political-economic systems that favor the strongest. Thus, in a world where the poor are increasingly numerous, we paradoxically see the growth of a wealthy elite, living in a bubble of comfort and luxury, almost in another world compared to ordinary people. This means that a culture still persists—sometimes well disguised—that discards others without even realizing it and tolerates with indifference that millions of people die of hunger or survive in conditions unfit for human beings.\n\nIn September, Leo issued an exhortation to Christians on love for the poor. The document builds upon the writings of Francis, who died in April 2025 at age 88 and who also decried the excesses of capitalism with references to how “this economy kills.”\n\nThat is bold language, but it is also an honest assessment, as was Francis’s 2024 notation: “It is often precisely the wealthiest who oppose the realization of social justice or integral ecology out of sheer greed.”\n\nIn this season of light and charity, we have every reason to hope for the renewal of those instincts that Abraham Lincoln identified as “the better angels of our nature.” To do so, we must recognize the urgency of Pope Francis’s warning that “as long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality, no solution will be found for the world’s problems or, for that matter, to any problems.” When he repeated this observation shortly before his passing, Francis observed, “I know it bothers [people when I say that], but it is the truth.”\n\nIn this time of unrelenting, often unprecedented cruelty and lawlessness, I’m grateful for Nation readers like you.\n\nSo many of you have taken to the streets, organized in your neighborhood and with your union, and showed up at the ballot box to vote for progressive candidates. You’re proving that it is possible—to paraphrase the legendary Patti Smith—to redeem the work of the fools running our government.\n\nAnd as we head into 2026, I promise that The Nation will fight like never before for justice, humanity, and dignity in these United States.\n\nAt a time when most news organizations are either cutting budgets or cozying up to Trump by bringing in right-wing propagandists, The Nation’s writers, editors, copy editors, fact-checkers, and illustrators confront head-on the administration’s deadly abuses of power, blatant corruption, and deconstruction of both government and civil society.\n\nWe couldn’t do this crucial work without you.\n\nThrough the end of the year, a generous donor is matching all donations to The Nation’s independent journalism up to $75,000. But the end of the year is now only days away.\n\nTime is running out to have your gift doubled.

    "fullText": "Inter Milan reportedly ‘sketched out’ a detailed plan to sign Atalanta midfielder Ederson last summer.\n\nAccording to Corriere di Bergamo via FCInter1908, the Brazilian was Inter’s top target ahead of Ademola Lookman.\n\nDespite spending most of the summer trying to land the Nigerian winger, the Nerazzurri eventually ended up empty-handed.\n\nIndeed, Atalanta fended off Inter’s repeated attempts to close the deal, even banishing the former RB Leipzig ace from the squad.\n\nHowever, Lookman was not Inter’s priority.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 15: Éderson of Atalanta BC and Amir Richardson of ACF Fiorentina in action during the Serie A match between Atalanta and Fiorentina at Gewiss Stadium on September 15, 2024 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Francesco Scaccianoce/Getty Images)\n\nBefore going ‘all-out’ in their pursuit of Lookman, Inter had hoped to lure Ederson away from Bergamo.\n\nWith Hakan Calhanoglu heavily linked with a move to Istanbul, the Nerazzurri had identified Ederson as his replacement.\n\nFurthermore, Cristian Chivu’s men were reportedly willing to offer around €60 million to land the 26-year-old.\n\nYet, like in Lookman’s case, Atalanta had no interest in selling their first-team stalwart under any circumstances.\n\nLa Dea’s stance might change, especially considering Ederson’s contract runs out in the summer of 2027.",

    "fullText": "I will always remember Willson Contreras fondly as a Cardinal. He was a total pro when it comes to putting up with the Cardinals organizational moves and their handling of his catching and subsequent move to first base. Which he excelled at. His personality was too much for some fans, but he was a true competitor and team leader in his own way. Sure he was slightly unpredictable and lost too much to e due to injuries, but that is part of the downside of his ferocious style of baseball. I think most fans will miss his spirit and competitiveness, which also made watching baseball more entertaining if you are into ridiculous baseball players.\n\nHe was, in my opinion, classy about it. He wasn’t as mean spirited as many characters that have played hardball throughout the ages, but he certainly rubbed some people the wrong way. When I watched however, it made me glad he was able to have his own style of play. And he was actually really good, once you got down to it.\n\nHe was never as bad of a defensive catcher as portrayed, and he was rather offensive at the plate, hacking away and trying to get a hit. And he could hit the ball hard.\n\nHis 2024 season will make some of us wonder what would’ve been if he didn’t miss nearly half the season and if he was surrounded by a little better team. It was probably his peak season if you extrapolate out to 29 home runs and the highest wOBA and wRC+ of his career including his time with the Cubs. If he tops that we will miss him even more.\n\nWillson converted himself to one of the best first basemen in MLB last year: 11th best in fWAR and wRC+ (tied with Alec Burleson at 124!). When bragging about his defense after he made the conversion, he was bettered by only Matt Olson and Lenny Sosa in 2025 according to fangraphs. So by switching to Burly, we probably aren’t going to miss much hitting-wise, but our defense will worsen somewhat… To what extent it’ll be noticeable at first base we will have to wait and see.\n\nOn offense one big difference will probably be that Burly won’t strike out nearly as much as Willson. It is quite possible Burleson will have a better year at the plate than Contreras. And maybe most importantly, one of Burleson or Contreras had to be traded in this rebuild phase. This prevents Alec Burleson the outfielder from happening for the most part.\n\nThe bat tape chewing incident and the box of candy throwing fit will be entertaining memories of the competitive and sometimes dominant at bats by Contreras. He will be remembered fondly by many Cardinals fans, and I wish him well even if it’s the Red Sox he’s playing for now. Willson is an asset to any team, a true team player and competitor.\n\nI am turning 50 today and am meeting up with a few friends and family, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all you reading out there. Please talk amongst yrselves you elves and reindeer and other characters 🦌🎄",

Fowler now has a .918 save percentage, which is incredible when we consider his lack of professional experience. Beyond Fowler, the Habs received important contributions from their best players, which is always a good recipe for a win.

Statistically speaking, Thursday night’s game versus the Bruins wasn’t just a great showing by Hutson, it was the best game of the year from any Habs player. Interestingly, Hutson has registered the highest game score of any player this season, and he also holds the second, third, and fourth spot on the list.\n\nwell this is certainly a statement pic.twitter.com/HPEbRqrhC2\n\n— HockeyStatCards (@hockeystatcards) December 24, 2025\n\nHere’s what the game scores looked like for the entire team.

[New Jersey Devils]\n\nThere have been a lot of factors behind the Toronto Maple Leafs‘ dreadful season thus far. One of the most putrid facets of the team has been its NHL-worst power play. And with that, the Leafs have made their first major move to try to change their fortunes by firing assistant coach Marc Savard. The power play was his responsibility. [Toronto Maple Leafs]",

    "fullText": "It’s been more than two weeks since the firing of Sherrone Moore, and a lot has changed in Michigan’ search for its new head football coach since then. Kalen DeBoer and Kenny Dillingham were the top guys at the beginning of the search, but both those guys are now seemingly out with Alabama winning its first-round game in the College Football Playoff last Friday and Dillingham signing a new deal with Arizona State last Saturday.\n\nA lot of the recent reports have been focused on Louisville head coach Jeff Brohm, and that is now being reflected in the Vegas betting odds.\n\nAccording to BetOnline, the new betting favorite to be the next head coach of the Wolverines is Brohm (+150). Michigan interim head coach Biff Poggi (+300) and former Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham (+300) are right on Brohm’s heels, as is Washington head coach Jedd Fisch (+500) despite there being no buzz for him lately. Interestingly enough, DeBoer is still listed here with +900 odds.\n\nThe last time we checked on these betting odds, Dillingham was the favorite with -150 odds, while Brohm was a major long shot with +3,300 odds. Poggi was also a long shot with +2,000 odds, but has made a major move up the list on BetOnline.\n\nAs is the case with any head coaching search, things are changing by the moment. What’s true today may not be true tomorrow, and that is most certainly the case here. While nobody truly knows who Michigan’s next head football coach will be until we get official word from the athletic department, there is no denying that Brohm’s name is picking up steam here and is the one to watch as we head into the Christmas holiday.\n\nWho do you want to be Michigan’s next head coach?

    "description": "On this Christmas Eve, Orioles fans can appreciate just how active their team has been this offseason.",
    "fullText": "A quiet period in MLB may be approaching. Baseball players, agents, and executives are people, and they also like to spend time with family around the holidays. With today being Christmas Eve, that could mean relatively few moves of significance in the next couple of days.\n\nBut that’s OK! The Orioles have been the busiest team in baseball so far this offseason. They are far better now than they were at the end of the 2025 season, and their aggressiveness so far leads me to believe they will act to shore up the couple of holes left of the roster before spring training arrives. I can let them have a few days to chill.\n\nIf I were to write up a last-minute Christmas wish list of players I want to the Orioles to add, it would be pretty short at this point. Jolly old Saint Mike Elias has been cooking. But there are still some things I’ve got my eye on.\n\nIn the rotation, I want one more arm, but not just any arm. The unit needs a proven veteran that you “know” is going to give you quality innings. While I like the the trio of Kyle Bradish, Trevor Rogers, and Shane Baz, we have to admit they come with some unknowns and significant risk. And if I’m honest, the free agent options just don’t seem like a fit unless one of them goes for the short-term, high AAV deal that Elias is probably angling for. In my dreams, I want Tarik Skubal. More realistically, I’m good with Freddy Peralta.\n\nMy other desires are less specific. This team needs another veteran bullpen arm, preferably a lefty. I’m not picky. Just grab anything that looks like decent quality at a reasonable price. The same goes for a utility infield option. The one I have (Jeremiah Jackson) doesn’t fit just right. I need someone with a glove I can count on, especially on the middle infield. It shouldn’t cost too much.\n\nWhat I really want, I can’t even ask for. It’s just too much. But if you poke me enough, I suppose I will relent. Give me a Gunnar Henderson extension. I know. I know. It’s not happening. They are impossible to find and extremely expensive. But sometimes it’s fun to dream. So I will put it out into the universe just in case.\n\nHonestly, I won’t be greedy this holiday season. My team is making an effort. They are trying to win in 2026. That’s just about all I could reasonably ask for.\n\nPirates To Sign Ryan O’Hearn | MLB Trade Rumors\nThe Pirates have made some interesting changes this offseason that should make them a more competitive team in 2026. They have been trying to find a left-handed slugger type for a while now, including offers to Josh Naylor and Kyle Schwarber. They will settle for the former Oriole O’Hearn instead, who enjoyed a career revival in Baltimore prior to a midseason trade to San Diego last year. Hopefully he crushes it in Pittsburgh for the next two years.\n\nMets Interested In Austin Hays | MLB Trade Rumors\nThe Mets are having a weird offseason. Cleaning the slate and going in a different direction makes sense. The team hasn’t been good enough. But some of the alternative paths they are taking don’t make a ton of sense if they goal is to win in 2026.\n\nQuestions linger as Orioles dive deeper into their offseason | Roch Kubatko\nRoch recaps some of the Christmas Eve moves of Orioles past. Spoiler: not much has happened, so don’t expect it to change in 2025.\n\nIs it your birthday? Happy birthday!\n\nMiguel Castro turns 31 today. He spent parts of four seasons in the Orioles bullpen from 2017 through ‘20. In that time he had a 4.06 ERA over 241.2 total innings.\n\nKevin Millwood turns 51. He played just the 2010 season in Baltimore, but he was named Opening Day starter that year and finished second on the team in innings with 190.2.\n\nThe late Chico García (b. 1924, d. 2007) was born on this day. A legend in his native Mexico, García played in just 39 MLB games, all of which came for the newly-arrived 1954 Orioles.\n\nChristmas Eve has been a slow day in Orioles history, according to Baseball Reference. Maybe that changes today. Until then, here are a few things that have happened on the date beyond Birdland:\n\n1814 – Representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States sign the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812.\n\n1818 – The first performance of “Silent Night” takes place in Austria.\n\n1826 – The Eggnog Riot at the United States Military Academy begins at a drunken Christmas party in the North Barracks. It ends the next morning.\n\n1906 – The first radio broadcast is transmitted by Reginald Fessenden. It consists of a poetry reading, a violin solo, and a speech.\n\n1973 – The District of Columbia Home Rule Act is passed, allowing residents of Washington D.C. to elect their own local government.",

    "description": "The ex-Patriots and ex-Jets in the fold for Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Some things have changed since the New England Patriots faced the New York Jets in November. Most things, personnel-wise, have stayed the same.\n\nBetween the active rosters, practice squads and reserve lists, eight players currently in the fold have spent time with both AFC East clubs during their NFL careers.\n\nHere’s a run through the familiar list ahead of Sunday’s 1 p.m. ET kickoff at MetLife Stadium.\n\nAndrew Beck, fullback — Signed by the Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 2019, Beck was waived at the NFL’s 53-man roster deadline following his rookie preseason. He would be claimed by the Denver Broncos from there and now stands 85 games and 24 starts into his run. The 29-year-old fullback by way of the Texas Longhorns has caught 30 passes for 252 yards and four touchdowns. Beck has also visited the end zone as a rusher. The league’s 2021 winner of the Salute to Service Award made stops with the Houston Texans and Green Back Packers before heading to East Rutherford last February.\n\nChukwuma Okorafor, offensive tackle — Okorafor has appeared in 13 games on special teams for the Jets in 2025. The reserve tackle stayed in the division in March after being released from his one-year Patriots contract a month ahead of the new league year. Okorafor’s brief stay in Foxborough brought 12 offensive snaps as the starting left tackle during the 2024 season opener. Subsequently replaced, the 28-year-old out of Western Michigan landed on the left squad list and reverted to the reserves as his roster exemption expired. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Okorafor in the third round of the 2018 draft at No. 92 overall, and he started 59 games in the AFC North.\n\nLiam Fornadel, guard — Fornadel signed with the Jets in training camp and is now in his second tour on the organization’s practice squad. The 26-year-old interior lineman joined the Patriots as a street free agent in 2024. He spent the majority of last campaign on the practice squad before being released with weeks remaining in the slate. Undrafted out of James Madison, Fornadel spent 2022 with the CFL’s Winnipeg Blue Bombers and has also been a member of the DC Defenders from the XFL and UFL, winning a championship last spring.\n\nOchaun Mathis, linebacker — The Jets added Mathis to the practice squad midway through December. The 26-year-old linebacker stands 14 games, five tackles, one forced fumble and one quarterback hit into his career. Chosen in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL draft at No. 189 overall, Mathis logged his rookie campaign between the active roster and injured reserve of the Los Angeles Rams. He moved on to Gillette Stadium the following August. After three standard elevations, he climbed from the practice squad to the 53 from October into November. Subsequently waived, the former transfer from TCU to Nebraska caught on with the Philadelphia Eagles and earned a Super Bowl LIX ring as part of the practice squad. Mathis spent time this fall with the Cleveland Browns.\n\nNick Folk, kicker — Folk finds himself 257 NFL games into a journey that got underway in the sixth round of the 2007 draft at No. 178 overall. The 41-year-old Arizona alum was named a Pro Bowler as a rookie. He went on be a Jet from 2010 through 2016. And now he is one again after working out and signing in July. The season has included a career-long field goal from 58 yards as well as a game-winning split of the uprights from 56 yards. Folk was part of the operation in Foxborough from 2019 through 2022, converting on 108-of-121 field goals and 116-of-127 extra points. AFC Special Teams Player of the Week was earned four times over that span, all while the veteran kicker tied for the league lead in scoring and set a league record for the most consecutive conversions from inside 50 yards. Folk’s Patriots stay ended via trade. He has also been with the Alliance of American Football as well as the Dallas Cowboys, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tennessee Titans.\n\nBrandon Smith, wide receiver — The Patriots signed Smith to the practice squad in advance of the divisional rematch. The 27-year-old wide receiver entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent out of Iowa in 2021. After parts of two seasons on the Dallas Cowboys’ practice squad, he made multiple tours in the XFL with the DC Defenders. He then went from the Arizona Cardinals in 2023 to East Rutherford up into 2025. Three appearances followed as a standard elevation for the Jets, bringing the initial 22 snaps of his career between offense and special teams.\n\nMorgan Moses, offensive tackle — Across all 15 starts this fall, Moses has stayed in for 95.9 percent of the offensive snaps and returned last week from a knee injury that left him questionable. The 34-year-old right tackle signed with Patriots in March on a three-year pact. Entering the league out of Virginia in the third round of the 2014 draft at No. 66 overall, Moses has appeared in 181 games and started 173. The seasoned bookend has also been a member of the Washington Commanders and Baltimore Ravens. He’s twice called MetLife Stadium home, as well. First as a free agent in 2021 and then again in 2024 as a trade acquisition, Moses tallied 30 starts while among the front five for New York.\n\nLeonard Taylor III, defensive tackle — The Patriots signed Taylor to the practice squad in the midst of October after he cleared waivers via the Jets. He served as a standard elevation for the first time in December, notching five defensive snaps along with two tackles on quarterback Josh Allen. The 23-year-old defensive tackle entered the NFL with New York as an undrafted free agent in 2024. He made the 53-man roster and appeared in 16 games altogether, posting 27 tackles, 1.5 sacks and a pair of batted passes through 308 snaps on defense and 14 snaps on special teams.",

    "description": "Scarlets host Ospreys in the west Wales derby on 26 December in the United Rugby Championship (URC).",
    "fullText": "There is a question swirling around the rugby public in west Wales during this Christmas period.\n\nWill the December 2025 Welsh derby between Scarlets and Ospreys be the final one to be staged in Llanelli during the festive period?\n\nThere have not been many regular standout fixtures in the domestic Welsh calendar since the inception of regional rugby in 2003.\n\nThe double-header of Welsh derbies, normally staged the day after Christmas, has been one of those occasions.\n\nWhether there will be another December derby between these two sides at Parc y Scarlets in two years remains to be seen.\n\nThis is because the future of Ospreys and Scarlets in their current guise is up in the air, leaving players, coaches and supporters heading into another uncertain Christmas for Welsh rugby.\n\nThe 26 December edition of this fixture might be the final one in Llanelli because of the Welsh Rugby Union's plans to cut a professional side.\n\nWelsh rugby's governing body announced in October they want to reduce the amount of teams to three with licences to be granted in Cardiff, the west and east.\n\nNegotiations have continued but WRU has announced that a decision on how a team will be cut will now not happen before the end of the year.\n\nIt seemed there would be a straight shootout between Scarlets and Ospreys for the west licence before another proposal has emerged.\n\nThat is Ospreys owners, Y11 Sports and Media, buying WRU-owned Cardiff and enabling Welsh rugby bosses to get to their magic number of three.\n\nThe WRU and Y11 have both declined to comment on this possibility, fuelling fears of Ospreys supporters about their sides' future, while Cardiff fans have been vocal on social media against any such proposed takeover deal.\n\nBoth coaches have reminded people of the significance of this fixture.\n\n\"It's an important game in the calendar for our fans,\" said Scarlets head coach Dwayne Peel.\n\n\"There is a lot of tradition behind it. Before Ospreys v Scarlets it was Llanelli v Swansea and Llanelli v Neath.\n\n\"With two teams being so close, it's great for rivalry and communities. From a rugby spectacle, it has provided some good games.\n\n\"It's always been a great time of the year and I have fond memories as a player and fan.\"\n\nPeel's opposite number and former Scarlets team-mate Mark Jones agreed.\n\n\"It's the opportunity to go up against your closest rivals, both from a community perspective but also positional rivalry within Welsh rugby,\" said Jones.\n\n\"It brings that tribalism Welsh rugby is built on. That's the passion around the border rivalries.\n\n\"They [Scarlets] are our biggest rival, geographically and historically.\"\n\nJones is predicting Welsh rugby's latest perilous situation could provide some extra emotion.\n\n\"Looking at the landscape, I have no doubt that will be some sort of driver in sections of the media and supporters,\" said Jones.\n\n\"You need the emotion and desire but it's often around who controls that and who is the most accurate and disciplined. We are trying to get the balance right.\n\n\"If you are not up for this game, you have the wrong people in the room. I don't think that will be an issue.\"\n\nPeel celebrates family wedding with win in Cardiff\n\nChristmas cheers and jeers for Welsh sides\n\nIt will be a basement battle as Ospreys and Scarlets currently occupy the bottom two spots in the United Rugby Championships (URC).\n\nOspreys, who have only managed one league win in seven games, prop up the table with Scarlets one place above.\n\n\"It's never nice when you are down the bottom end, nobody wants to be there,\" said Jones.\n\n\"But when you look at how competitive the league is and what the difference is from ninth to 16th, it's a couple of wins and the whole world is different.\n\n\"It's early in the season and teams have had different runs of fixtures.\n\n\"I am not focused on where we are, I'm more interested in how we are playing and the accuracy of our game.\"\n\nHis sentiments were echoed by Peel, whose Scarlets' side have two league wins after losing the first four.\n\n\"I'm not overly concerned with league positions because I appreciate the start we had,\" said Peel.\n\n\"We will keep building and there's a lot of rugby to be played. If the performances are good enough, results look after themselves.\"\n\nScarlets are without injured Wales quartet Blair Murray, Sam Costelow, Josh Macleod and Kemsley Mathias.\n\nHooker Ryan Elias takes over the captaincy from Macleod who is replaced by the returning Taine Plumtree in one of four changes from the side that beat Cardiff.\n\nEllis Mee switches to full-back with Joe Roberts named on the wing, while props Alec Hepburn and Archer Holz start.\n\nOspreys are missing Wales prop Gareth Thomas but number eight Ross Moriarty starts after sitting out the 26-10 home defeat against Munster.\n\nWales squad places are also up for grabs with head coach Steve Tandy set to name his Six Nations squad for the tournament which starts with a trip to face England on 7 February.\n\n\"For internationals or young players coming through and trying to establish themselves, there is an opportunity to go up against a peer that is competing for the same position,\" said Jones.\n\nScarlets: Mee; Rogers, James, J Williams, Roberts; Hawkins; G Davies; Hepburn, Elias (capt), Holz, Lousi, Ball, Douglas, Plumtree, Anderson.\n\nReplacements: van der Merwe, Morse, H Thomas, T Davies, Taylor, Hughes, E Price, Page.\n\nOspreys: Walsh; Conbeer, Watkin, K Williams, Giles; Edwards, Hardy; S Thomas, Lake (capt), Henry, Sutton, R Smith, Ratti, Deaves, Moriarty.\n\nReplacements: Parry, G Phillips, Botha, R Davies, Morris, L Davies, Cokanasiga, Hopkins.\n\nAssistant referees: Craig Evans (WRU), Carwyn Sion (WRU)",

    "fullText": "Is former Boston Celtics shooting guard Ray Allen one of the greatest shooters of all time? The former University of Connecticut star is widely known as having one of the best forms for shooting from beyond the arc, and held the record for the most 3-point shots made in NBA history until he saw his record broken by Golden State Warriors legend Steph Curry.\n\nBut if you ask former Dubs sharpshooter in his own right, Klay Thompson, Curry's teammate for most of his career, whether he thinks Jesus Shuttlesworth (a nickname of Allen's from a role he played in the film 'He Got Game') should be counted among the game's greatest long-distance marksmen, you will get an emphatic yes from the Dallas Mavericks vet.\n\nThe folks behind the \"CLNS Media Boston Sports Network\" YouTube channel put together a clip from their \"Showtime with Coop\" podcast featuring Thompson, and that topic of course came up.

    "fullText": "Real Madrid are going through a difficult period now, with uncertainty ranging from Xabi Alonso’s future to a lack of cohesion among attackers.\n\nThe dynamics between Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr. have been particularly worrying, as the two have not been able to gel together as well as one would have hoped.\n\nWhile Mbappe has carried the team with goals, Vinicius looks like a shadow of his former self, leading to Santi Canizares stating that the terms being demanded by him from Real Madrid in the renewal deal are far more than what the player is producing right now.\n\nKeeping in mind the imbalanced power dynamic between Mbappe and Vinicius, Jose Mario Bakero has compared the situation to Barcelona in the 90s.\n\nThe former Barça player particularly compared the situation to the dynamics that unfolded between Hristo Stoichkov and Romario.\n\n“This happened to us a little, although not in the same way or with the same characteristics,” he told El Larguero (h/t Mundo Deportivo).\n\nIs the power imbalance growing at Real Madrid? (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nBakero explained how Barcelona used to be a stable unit, before Romero’s arrival threw them off balance.\n\n“When it was just Stoichkov, accompanied by Koeman and Laudrup, we had three pillars, and everything was more or less fine.\n\n“But, from the moment Romario arrived, two players with a personality that stood out above the rest of the group came in. It threw us off balance,” he revealed.\n\nFinally, Bakero warned that it is a dangerous game to have two defining egos in the same team and how it can disrupt a well-functioning team.\n\n“It’s unbalancing everyone, and especially themselves. In our case, Stoichkov and Romario lost many of the qualities they had.\n\n“So, what’s the problem? When you have two players who don’t understand each other’s roles, it becomes incredibly complicated,” he concluded.",

    "fullText": "This week, Chiefs Wire's Ed Easton Jr. spoke with retired All-Pro offensive lineman and CBS Sports analyst Kyle Long.\n\nIn his interview with Easton Jr., Long discussed his role as a remote analyst for NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix on Thursday, December 25th, and his thoughts on Travis Kelce potentially retiring after Patrick Mahomes' devastating knee injury.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Emmy and Grammy Award–winning superstar Kelly Clarkson will welcome fans with a performance of her holiday hit, \"Underneath the Tree.\" Snoop's Holiday Halftime Party features special guest Lainey Wilson and stars from KPOP Demon Hunters.\n\nNFL CHRISTMAS GAMEDAY\nLIVE on Netflix December 25\n-- \nCowboys vs. Commanders @ 1 PM ET\nLions vs. Vikings @ 4:30 PM ET\n\n— Netflix Sports (@netflixsports) December 18, 2025\n\nMahomes' Week 15 season-ending injury requiring surgery to repair his ACL and LCL won't likely have him back immediately for the start of the 2026 season. Long shared his thoughts on this, which could affect Kelce's future playing.\n\n\"Well, there was a book I read when I was younger. It's called 'Where the Red Fern Grows'. It was about, I don't really know what it was about, but there were two dogs in it, and they were so dang close,\" said Long, \"They did everything together, they hunted together, they ate together, they slept together. And once, one of the dogs got hurt on a barbed-wire fence. The dog didn't make it. It's one of the saddest stories I've ever read, and then the other dog couldn't eat anymore. It was sad.\"\n\nMahomes and Kelce have been one of the league's greatest duos since the 2018 season. The prospect of them returning to form with a healthy Mahomes is a sight many Chiefs fans would love to see after a disappointing 2025 season.\n\n\"Is that what happens in Kansas City,\" said Long, \"or are we going to see Travis Kelce, like he did this past offseason, train his butt off, come in the best shape of his life, be a top-five producing tight end in football, and wait for his homeboy (Patrick Mahomes) to show back up at quarterback? They can take some names and kick some butts, because people are taking their shots on the Kansas City Chiefs right now.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kyle Long on Travis Kelce's future after Patrick Mahomes' injury",

The early 1:00 pm window gets the lion's share of those games (seven), leaving just two for the late window.\n\nThe two games in the late window could not be more opposed in importance.\n\nThe 4:05 game on CBS is a matchup between the league's two worst teams -- the New York Giants and the Las Vegas Raiders -- who both enter Week 17 with 2-13 records, scrambling for the right to secure the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nKevin Harlan getting Raiders-Giants means the number 1 pick is going to be decided by an incredible play at the end of the game that we will all remember for years https://t.co/Mf99zBppAX\n\n— Clem (@TheClemReport) December 23, 2025\n\nSome prognosticators are calling this game the Tank Bowl. Bottom line: The loser is the real winner in this one.\n\nThe second game, at 4:25 on FOX, features the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles traveling to Buffalo to take on the Bills and Josh Allen.\n\nNow, how many people do you think will be turning the channel at 4:25 from CBS to FOX? We're guessing a whole lot. These two teams could find themselves in the Super Bowl this February.\n\nThe Giants are on a nine-game losing streak and have lost 13 consecutive road games going back to last season. The Raiders are also on a nine-game skid. They are just 1-6 at home this year.\n\nNo matter where one turns on late Sunday afternoon, Tom Brady will have some influence and interest. He is a minority owner of the Raiders, and he will be serving as the booth analyst for the Bills-Eagles game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: The Tank Bowl: Will anyone watch New York Giants vs. Las Vegas Raiders?",

    "fullText": "College football has never been more transactional than it is right now.\n\nWith players allowed to make money through Name, Image and Likeness deals and a transfer portal that currently features 852 athletes, the sport is truly in a new day and age. Private equity is starting to get involved, adding to the corporate feel that is growing.\n\nThat’s what makes the culture that Arizona State football coach Kenny Dillingham has created in Tempe stand out. Yes, Dillingham might be the most easy-going coach in college football when it comes to the transfer portal. Not many other coaches will wish you good luck and promote your transfer on social media.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean ASU is just a bus stop and hoping to reload with transfer portal players every season. There’s a sense of real connection within the building.\n\nSophomore linebacker Martell Hughes was recruited from high school in San Diego as part of the second class signed under Dillingham. Hughes said he was drawn in specifically because of Dillingham.\n\n“The culture that coach Kenny had defined, that he wanted to bring, especially with all the new guys he brought in with the portal,” Hughes said. “The plan he had built for this and the city of Tempe. Just believing in him and the coaching staff is what ultimately brought me here.”\n\nThe word is used throughout the world of sports, yet there is no one singular definition. It’s different everywhere.\n\n“Being a family, being passionate, having the love and want to do this and day in and day out,” Hughes said. “He talks about it every day. Football is hard, and it’s a violent game, but if you don’t love it, there’s no point in doing it. His passion and love for his guys on the team, staff, it just runs through everybody. It’s infectious.”\n\nOr, as Dillingham has made the motto of the team: “Have more fun while working harder than anybody in the country.”\n\nThe phrase is blasted all over the team’s walls and has been repeated countless times by Dillingham and his players. Now, it has come to personify the nature of these Sun Devils.\n\nIt’s one of the reasons why Hughes has stayed in Tempe, instead of entering the portal and trying to get more playing time elsewhere.\n\n“Coming out of high school, they took the chance on me,” Hughes said. “They mapped out a plan for me and for this program. Believing in them. Why would I jump ship when they put their all into me?”\n\nThat belief is on track to pay off as Hughes, after learning and developing from Keyshaun Elliott and Jordan Crook the past two seasons, appears ready to move up the depth chart entering 2026. Hughes had the game-sealing interception in the win against TCU.\n\nEven for players who have spent time in other locker rooms, like graduate student and offensive lineman Ben Coleman, the culture at ASU is distinctive.\n\nColeman played 25 games at the University of California and earned his bachelor's and master's there before transferring to Tempe. He played the last two seasons for Arizona State after receiving an extra year of eligibility.\n\n“It’s different here,” Coleman said. “It’s very personal the way they challenge us, in the weight room, on the football field. The way they will us to compete in everything we do. Doesn’t matter if it’s Madden, (NBA) 2K, bringing a hoop out here, playing knockout. Everything is competing. That’s why we have a basketball hoop in the football team room, for that exact reason.”\n\nThe competition never ends. The team tracks what every player does and compiles it. It's referred to as “Skittles Wars.” From breakfast check-in to study hall and reps in the weight room, nothing goes unnoticed. At the end of the season, a winner is declared.\n\n“You wake up, and the first thing you do before you even open a notebook is, ‘Hey man. Let’s compete right now,’” Coleman said. “If you can’t compete, he doesn’t want anybody there who doesn’t want to compete.”\n\nLike Coleman, defensive lineman Justin Wodtly spent time in other locker rooms, playing at Cincinnati before transferring ahead of the 2024 season. Some of those locker rooms were strictly football, nothing else.\n\n“I’ve had three head coaches,” Wodtly said. “Here, it shows how much Coach Dillingham really cares about the team, how much he cares about building relationships, how much he cares about your life outside of football. Doing all those things is a testament to who he is as a person.”\n\nPerhaps the person who most embodies — literally — the culture that has been created at Arizona State is Wodtly.\n\nOnly 18 months passed before Wodtly decided to make ASU part of his body, getting a sprawling tattoo on his right calf with Sparky’s pitchfork as the centerpiece, set in front of a desert landscape with saguaros, mountains and lightning in the sky.\n\nAnd more could be on the way in the future.\n\n“It’s a huge part of me, who I am,” Wodtly said. “I appreciate this university. I’m very grateful for the time I got to spend here. I might have to add to it soon.”\n\nLogan Stanley is a sports reporter with The Arizona Republic who primarily focuses on high school, college and Olympic sports.

    "fullText": "Formula 1 fans have been losing it over Charles Leclerc's gift to George Russell for the championship's Secret Santa.\n\nThe Monegasque driver decided to frame a photo of his overtake of Russell at the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix, which was a point of contention for the British driver. As the Ferrari driver attacked Russell on the outside of Turn 11 at a safety car restart during the race at Zandvoort, he appeared to leave the track on the outside of Turn 12 before rejoining ahead of Russell.\n\n\"He was off the track, surely?\" Russell said over team radio as Leclerc said to his team: \"Turn 11, 12, he doesn’t leave a space. He cannot complain.\"\n\nThe stewards investigated the move, and both drivers were summoned after the race. The stewards later noted that \"both drivers felt that this was a racing incident and that there should be no further consequence to either driver for the incident\", which they agreed with.\n\n\"Naughty, naughty, naughty,\" Russell said with a smile as he pulled back the bubble wrap to reveal the photo. \"Let's see part two, shall we?\" he added as he uncovered the electric photo frame showing a slow-motion version of the overtake.\n\n\"Oh, look at that! That is so kind of him,\" he added, with a hint of sarcasm, before adding: \"He can overtake illegally, so that's all he's got in the locker. Bashing people off the track. I'm lost for words actually, I'm lost for words.\"\n\nCharles Leclerc knew what to get George Russell for Christmas immediately after picking him in Secret Santa 😅 pic.twitter.com/Jo0H9oE9sB\n\n— Autosport (@autosport) December 24, 2025\n\nThe moment between Leclerc and Russell quickly became a hot topic in the comments with reactions from fans flooding in. \"Charles well and truly understood the assignment. He has been on a mission to ragebait Russell all year,\" one wrote, while another added: \"Charles' gift is wild.\"\n\n\"Leclerc with the master ragebait,\" someone else commented, with another adding: \"George was livid, that’s peak British anger.\"\n\n\"Charles pulling Russell's leg and getting him very angry was the best gift,\" wrote another fan.\n\nAnother added: \"Charles has a diabolical sense of humour.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Ohio State begins its quest for a repeat national championship in the Cotton Bowl against the Miami Hurricanes.",
    "fullText": "Some time has passed since Ohio State found itself on the wrong side of the scoreboard in the Big Ten Championship game. As much as that loss stung, of the three goals the football team has, a conference championship is the one fans can live without.\n\nThe Buckeyes have moved on to the College Football Playoff and a matchup with the Miami Hurricanes. Miami moved on after an opening-round win over Texas A&M by a score of 10-3. The reward? A date with No. 2 Ohio State in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic.\n\nOf course, the Hurricanes and Buckeyes have a history in games that mean something. Miami fans have been crying foul for 20-plus years after a pass interference call allowed Ohio State to win its first National Championship since 1968. Buckeye fans will tell you it was the right call... and it was.\n\nThe U wants revenge. Ohio State wants back-to-back titles. It's the Buckeyes vs. the 'Canes—time to get ready for the College Football Playoff Quarterfinals.\n\nThe stage is set 🗣️\n\nNo. 2 Buckeyes 🆚 No. 10 Hurricanes in the Cotton Bowl 🏟️\n\n🔗 https://t.co/iWlQmFbLBo pic.twitter.com/aGJQfnyI7A\n\n— Ohio State Buckeyes 🌰 (@OhioStAthletics) December 20, 2025\n\nOhio State (12-1), Miami (11-2)\n\nVenue: AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas), Capacity: 80,000\n\nAll-Time Series: Series tied at 2\n\nLast Meeting: Miami defeated Ohio State 24-6 in 2011\n\nThe Ohio State football team finds itself in familiar territory. The Buckeyes are back in the College Football Playoff once again, this time looking to repeat as National Champions. Standing in the way... The Miami Hurricanes. While Miami may have two losses on the season, this is a team loaded with talent. Several players who now reside in South Florida were originally committed to OSU, including running back Mark Fletcher and defensive lineman Justin Scott.\n\nThis will be the second game in a row where Ohio State will face a top-tier defense, most notably on the defensive line. Both Akheem Mesidor and Rueben Bain Jr. are a menace to opposing backfields. The duo has combined for 16 sacks and five forced fumbles. The Buckeye offensive line will need to protect Julian Sayin better than they did against Indiana in the Big Ten Championship game. In that game, Sayin was sacked five times, which was nearly as many as the 12 previous games combined.\n\nThe Hurricanes love to pressure opposing quarterbacks. On the season, Miami has 41 sacks on the season, seven of which came against Texas A&M in the CFP first round. Rueben Bain got to Marcell Reed three times all by himself. Ohio State has the best skill players in the country, but it's hard to get the ball to playmakers from your backside.\n\nThere are ways to neutralize a strong pass rush by dialing up screen passes, quick slants, and draw plays. Ryan Day has said he will be taking over playcalling duties, so we can expect to see some more creativity to counterattack the aggressive style of Miami. If not, it'll be a long day for the Buckeye offense.\n\nDefensively, Ohio State is still a force to be reckoned with. The Hurricanes do have excellent players at the skill positions, but the team seems to lose focus from time to time. Especially quarterback Carson Beck. The Georgia transfer has thrown for over 3,000 yards and 26 touchdowns, but he's also thrown 10 interceptions.\n\nPressure on Beck is a must. When Beck has been made to feel uncomfortable in the pocket, he is much more prone to mistakes. According to Pro Football Focus, when Beck is pressured, he is the No. 112-ranked quarterback in the nation. When he is not blitzed and allowed to sit in a clean pocket, he is the No. 18-ranked quarterback. Simply put, Beck can carve up a defense if he has time to survey the field, but speed him up and he is much more likely to make mistakes.\n\nMario Cristobal will look for ways to get the ball in the hands of his dynamic freshman, Malachi Toney. The youngster leads Miami with 89 receptions, nearly 1,000 yards, and eight touchdowns. But again, pressure Beck and he'll have a hard time getting Toney the ball.\n\nThe bottom line is that both defenses are spectacular. It's a tale as old as time: whoever can win the line of scrimmage will win the game.\n\nPhillip Daniels - Offensive Line\n\nWe really could put the entire offensive line here, but we decided to go with just one. After being a solid contributor at right tackle all season long, Phillip Daniels struggled against the Indiana pass rush in the Big Ten Championship game. Part of that may have been that the Hoosiers have smaller, quicker edge rushers. Daniels has the opportunity to redeem himself and will need to allow Julian Saying time to throw the ball, or the Buckeyes will be in a world of hurt.\n\nAs we stated earlier, Carson Beck is prone to making mistakes when under pressure. Caden Curry has been a sack master this season, getting to opposing quarterbacks 11 times. Miami has been good at protecting Beck, giving up only 11 sacks the entire season. Curry doesn't need to get a sack on every play, but provide enough pressure to keep Beck on his heels. If he can do that, the defense should be able to hold the Hurricane offense in check.\n\nAt first glance, this game seems to favor the Scarlet and Gray somewhat heavily. On paper, OSU looks like the superior team, but that wouldn't be the full story. Both Miami and Ohio State boast two of the best defenses in the country. Both teams are littered with NFL talent. Both teams have electric playmakers on offense. So what will this game come down to?\n\nThe game will most likely be a slog, much like the Buckeyes' game against Indiana in the Big Ten Championship. And in a game of this magnitude, it is true once again, whoever can win in the trenches will come out on top when the clock strikes zero. In a game where both teams are somewhat evenly matched, Ohio State has a slight advantage on both sides of the ball. While the Miami defense may be able to hold the Buckeye offense in check for most of the night, the skill positions are just too good, especially with a laser-focused Ryan Day taking over the play-calling duties. It's close going into halftime, but Ohio State pulls away in the second half to advance to the College Football Playoff Semifinals.\n\nFinal score prediction | Ohio State 24, Miami 13\n\nContact/Follow us @BuckeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Ohio State news and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buckeyes Wire: Ohio State football Cotton Bowl preview and prediction vs. Miami",

    "title": "Arizona Cardinals mock draft. Predictions for first 10 picks",
    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals need a quarterback this offseason. The question is whether they'll be able to find one in the first round of the NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "How have we gotten here? This Arizona Cardinals’ season was supposed to lead to the playoffs. At the very least, it was supposed to lead to contention. Christmas week should have been about setting the stage for a heavyweight showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nInstead, the Bengals are 5-10 and the Cardinals are somehow even worse, at 3-12.\n\nSo now, that familiar time of year has arrived, far earlier than anyone had hoped. It’s mock draft season.\n\nThis year’s draft class is widely considered to be a thin group, but that’s OK for the Cardinals. They currently hold the No. 6 pick. The big question, though, is where they’ll be able to find their quarterback of the future.\n\nSo for the first time, here are our top 10 projected picks of the 2026 NFL Draft. As always, this mock draft is without trades.\n\nIf the Giants do ultimately end up with the No. 1 pick, a trade becomes highly likely. New York already has a promising young quarterback, Jaxson Dart, while the rest of the top 10 is packed with quarterback-needy teams — including the Cardinals, of course.\n\nWould Arizona pony up the package required for the top selection? That’s a question for general manager Monti Ossenfort and, potentially, head coach Jonathan Gannon, if he retains his job. But it might be the best path to a quarterback, given the teams currently ahead of them.\n\nIf the Giants beat the Raiders this week, though, Las Vegas will jump into the No. 1 spot. Unlike the Giants, the Raiders desperately need quarterback help and would not likely trade the pick.\n\nAs for Reese, he could be the top non-quarterback off the board, as a versatile, explosive player who can line up off the edge or at linebacker. It’s just unlikely it will actually be at the No. 1 pick after trades.\n\nMendoza, this year’s Heisman Trophy winner, is noted for his elite football intelligence and ability to play on-time within an offense. If this Cardinals’ coaching staff remains in place, that will be an appealing proposition, given that they preferred Jacoby Brissett to Kyler Murray for those reasons. The problem will be getting a high enough draft pick to secure Mendoza, who is the betting favorite for the top pick.\n\nSome expect Moore to remain in school, as he has made just 18 career starts and could earn a nice NIL payday if he returned to Oregon. But as his draft stock climbs, so too do his chances of declaring. That would be a major boost for the Cardinals, who need as many quarterbacks as possible in this class to help their chances of finding one. On the field, Moore stands out with his accuracy and creativity as a passer.\n\nAs has been the case for most of the past five decades, the Jets need a quarterback this spring. But if they end up behind the Raiders and Browns, that might require a trade up. Fortunately for New York, they have five first-round picks over the next two years — ammunition that the Cardinals can’t match.\n\nAs for Bain, he’s a powerful edge rusher who just notched three sacks against Texas A&M in the College Football Playoff. He could be the first defensive player off the board.\n\nUnlike the quarterback-needy teams around them, the Titans are in a great spot. Their top offseason priority will be finding talent to help support Cam Ward. And no matter where they end up, they should be able to draft either Tate or Jordyn Tyson, the top two wide receivers.\n\nSo, this is the Cardinals’ conundrum. Only two quarterbacks are currently seen as top-five picks, and one of them might stay in college.\n\nTrading up would be expensive, especially for a team that has holes all over its roster. Ty Simpson — the potential third quarterback off the board — would be a reach. There are few good options, unless their pick moves up over the next two weeks.\n\nAll of that could leave the Cardinals looking to another position. That’s where Fano comes in. He’s an athletic player who is widely considered the top tackle in the class. Pairing him with Paris Johnson Jr. would give the Cardinals their tackle duo of the future and boost an offensive line that has struggled in 2025.\n\nPurely from a talent perspective, Love might be the best player in this class. But as with Ashton Jeanty last year, the issue is positional value. Washington would be passing up on much-needed defensive help to draft Love.\n\nStill, the idea is tantalizing: a hyper-talented running back to pair with Jayden Daniels. That would give Washington one of the league’s most dangerous rushing attacks and reduce the need for Daniels to play hero ball, potentially helping him stay healthier.\n\nTyler Shough has been a pleasant late-season surprise, removing the Saints from the list of teams that need quarterback help. Drafting Tyson to pair with Chris Olave would suddenly create the potential for an exciting offense in New Orleans.\n\nWhile a homecoming with Tyson might be enticing for local fans — especially after missing out on Cam Skattebo last year — the fit doesn’t make much sense for the Cardinals. Wide receiver is one of their few positions of strength.\n\nIn many ways, Downs is the Jeremiyah Love of the defensive side — an elite talent at a non-premium position. The Bengals, though, need all the help they can get on defense, no matter where it comes. Downs would be a nice fit.\n\nSimpson is the wild card of this quarterback class. He could return to college, with only one year of starting experience under his belt. He could also slip to the back of the first round, due to both his lack of his experience and his struggles late in the season. Or teams could be wooed by his processing ability and early-season tape, shooting him up draft boards. All three options are on the table for now.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Early Arizona Cardinals 2026 NFL mock draft",

    "description": "The NBA's Christmas Day schedule is STACKED this year. Here's how you should prioritize watching each game.",
    "fullText": "There are few more delightful American traditions than the NBA's marquee Christmas Day slate. With no due respect to the brazen, oversaturated NFL — which has an abysmal Christmas schedule — the 25th of December will always belong to the Association and its biggest stars and best teams. It's just that much more special.\n\nWell, to be clear, Christmas with the NBA is actually special, for one.\n\nThis year, it sure seems like we're in for some Christmas barnburners. A three-time MVP takes on one of the NBA's bright, young superstars in the latest chapter of a wonderful rivalry in Denver. Two legends reunite with a holiday background in the Bay Area. Another MVP squares off against the possible future of the sport in Oklahoma City. Two star-laden teams try to see who's more worthy of the hype in Southern California. And a potential elite shotmaking battle could be in store at Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut not all of these matchups were created equal. Let's rank all five NBA Christmas games this year and determine which ones are worth at least slightly paying attention to, which ones are worth ignoring your family, and which ones you can probably ignore entirely. Note: All games will be available to watch on ESPN and ABC.\n\nIs it real hoops? Unfortunately, no.\n\nI get the intrigue of watching former longtime teammates, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, pitted against one another. I also think that a potential generational rookie like Cooper Flagg deserves the big Christmas stage. He'll make the most of it. But when we boil this game down, it features two of the Western Conference's more middling teams. It might be fun for a little while, like at the very start, but otherwise, expect some pretty forgettable basketball here. I don't think it's worth your time on a holiday.\n\nIs it real hoops? Uh ... maybe.\n\nBefore the season, the Cavaliers and Knicks looked like the clear top two teams in the East. A matchup in the Eastern Conference Finals seemed inevitable. The Knicks have held up their end of the bargain. The Cavaliers, who have already almost lost as many games this year as they did during all of last season's regular season, have not.\n\nWith that said, Donovan Mitchell and Jalen Brunson could make for some electric shotmaking in the clutch on both ends. This one is at least worth keeping on in the background at home to monitor.\n\nIs it real hoops? Yes, let's roll with it.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I think Alperen Şengün's and Kevin Durant's Rockets have a markedly higher ceiling as a legit NBA title contender. But it's hard to deny the Lakers' sheer star power, with Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves, and LeBron James. I don't think the Lakers can hang with the Rockets in a seven-game playoff series. I do, however, think they can push them in a potential Christmas classic that features so much talent on both ends of the floor.\n\nIs it real hoops? Oh goodness, YES. Absolutely, YES.\n\nWith two heated playoff meetings and seemingly countless down-to-the-wire regular-season meetings over the last three years, the Nuggets and Timberwolves have a legit case as the NBA's best active rivalry. It is, more often than not, what elite basketball should be all about. There is nothing like watching Nikola Jokić and Anthony Edwards trade shot after shot in a physical game between two squads who hate and respect each other so much at the same time.\n\nThis rivalry game concludes the NBA's Christmas Day slate this year. It will likely be the perfect dessert.\n\nIs it real hoops? Dearest readers, YES.\n\nI don't think the Thunder and Spurs have enough established history to consider them a real rivalry yet, but hoo boy, are they getting there. Victor Wembanyama has already made his displeasure with the Thunder well-known. Plus, his Spurs are one of the few teams to actually knock off juggernaut Oklahoma City so far this season. Expect a well-coached and disciplined game from both teams. Expect a few trademark, ridiculous sequences courtesy of Wembanyama, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and others.\n\nAnd expect a worthy early entry to what will likely eventually become the NBA's best rivalry down the line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Best NBA Christmas 2025 games to watch this year, ranked",

    "fullText": "Penn State and Clemson will meet for the second time ever on Saturday in the Pinstripe Bowl. The Tigers hold the series record with a 1-0 advantage after a dominant victory in the 1988 Citrus Bowl.\n\nThe teams met on New Year's Day in 1988, marking the first and only meeting. Clemson came out victorious, 35-10, in a dominant showing in Orlando, Florida.\n\nPenn State was led by quarterback Matt Knizner, who went 13-of-22 for 158 yards and one touchdown. He also threw two interceptions, as well.\n\nLeroy Thompson was the team's leading rusher, taking six carries for 55 yards. Receiving-wise, Michael Timpson caught four of Knizner's 13 completions for 81 yards. The Nittany Lions were without key offensive weapon Blair Thomas. The rushing and receiving threat missed the game due to a knee sprain. Thomas was the leading rusher on the team during the 1987 season with 1414 yards and 11 touchdowns, averaging 128.5 yards per game.\n\nWithout Thomas, the Nittany Lions' rushing attack took a significant drop, with the team running under Thomas's average mark, only earning 111 yards.\n\nOn Clemson's side, it was Rodney Williams behind the center. Williams earned the Citrus Bowl MVP, completing 15-of-24 passes for 214 yards. The Tigers had a balanced attack, running for 285 yards, as well.\n\nTerry Allen was the lead back, running 11 times for 105 yards and a touchdown. The Tigers scored all five of their touchdowns on the run game.\n\nWith both teams missing a multitude of their players, and Penn State once again missing at least one of its lead rushers, the 2025 edition of this series should be considerably closer.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Series history: Penn State, Clemson to meet for second time",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia 76ers had Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all on the floor on Tuesday when they took the floor to host the rebuilding Brooklyn Nets. The Sixers were missing VJ Edgecombe and other key pieces, but it was a game they were in a great position to get the win and handle their business.\n\nInstead, the Sixers struggled offensively as they shot just 40.7% from the floor and 7-for-27 from deep overall and fell to the Nets 114-106. Philadelphia had a chance to keep the good play rolling, but took a tough loss to Brooklyn as it couldn't find a rhythm.\n\nThe Sixers then had a scare a minute into the third quarter when Embiid took a hard hit from Nets guard Terance Mann and he was on the ground grabbing at his right knee in pain. He then got up under his own power and walked straight to the locker room leading to Andre Drummond entering the contest.\n\n\"Just hyperextended it,\" Embiid said after the loss. \"Went to the locker room, checked it out, and we'll see how I feel.\"\n\nFor Embiid, the big question is always how his knee feels the day after. So, when the big fella wakes up on Wednesday, the Sixers will then see how he feels and go from there.\n\n\"It’s alright,\" Embiid added. \"We’ll see how it feels. Obviously, when you’re hurt, it's kinda hard to judge so we'll see how it feels tomorrow.\"\n\nAs far as the issues with the Nets, Embiid pointed to the offensive struggles. The Sixers just never found a rhythm all night as the Nets used their length and athleticism to slow Philadelphia down and force them into some tougher looks. That led to a slowed offensive attack and some poor shooting percentages despite holding the Nets to 42.7% shooting. The big difference is Brooklyn drilled 17 triples compared to the seven for Philadelphia.\n\n\"Well, we couldn't make anything,\" Embiid explained. \"So, that's where it starts. You got to make shots. They just did a pretty good job just making everything tougher for us. It seemed like no one could really get it going tonight.\"\n\nThe Sixers will have two days off now before beginning a 5-game road trip after Christmas when they take on the Chicago Bulls on Friday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Joel Embiid discusses his knee, why Sixers lost to Nets at home",

    "fullText": "Just days after Texas A&M's 2025 season came to an end, losing to Miami 10-3 in the first round of the College Football Playoff, head coach Mike Elko will enter the offseason with plenty of questions regarding the offensive and defensive line, knowing that a ton of production will leave for the NFL and graduation, needing to secure starting level talent from the transfer portal.\n\nWith senior running back Le'Veon Moss off to the NFL after two injury-plagued seasons, combined with wide receiver KC Concepcion declaring for the 2026 NFL Draft, Elko and new offensive coordinator Holmon Wiggins will now be tasked with landing another receiver, and possibly another running back, which shouldn't be tough given the recent transfer additions.\n\nOne name to watch in the early stages, according to On3's Pete Nakos, is former Kansas State wide receiver Jayce Brown, who, despite former Texas A&M OC Collin Klein leaving to become Kansas State's new head coach, is reportedly considering the Aggies as one of his top destinations after Conecpcion's announcement.\n\nStanding at 6'0\" and 190 pounds, Brown led the Wildcats in receiving with 712 yards and five touchdowns, and was by far the most dependable receiver, and is a reliable deep threat due to his impressive speed and quickness, averaging 17.4 yards per reception. On paper, Brown is a plug-and-play receiver and would pair well with incoming junior Mario Craver and sophomore Ashton Bethel-Roman.\n\nIf the Aggies land Brown, this shores up the 2026 wide receiver room, which still lacks size, but will be one of the fastest units in the country.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M is the 'school of note' for transfer WR Jayce Brown",

I don’t see rankings as a sore spot; they’re part of the landscape. They don’t define what we’re doing or what we’re not doing. I’m so proud of what we’re doing, and we are starting to get recognized.\n\n“It was a very steep hill to climb, I mean from winning 11 games last year and now all of a sudden we want to be ranked in the Top 25? We’re just controlling our preparation. If rankings do or don’t exist, it doesn’t matter to us. It’s a nod of respect. ... But I’m more concerned with how our players are growing, how they’re competing, how connected they are.\n\n“The rankings may tell that story as a complete body of work, but it doesn’t win games.”\n\nArizona State did receive seven votes in the AP poll, but none in the coaches poll.\n\nMiller and the Sun Devils are off until they continue play in the Big 12 with road games at Utah (10-3) on Wednesday, Dec. 31, and at BYU (12-1) on Saturday, Jan. 3.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: ASU women's basketball coach Miller talks her 14-0, unranked team",

The MOU assured Notre Dame that they would be included in the field if they were ranked in the top-12 or top-14 depending on the size of the field according to a report by Yahoo!.\n\nNicole Auerbach of NBC Sports shared on social media that every Big Ten team was made aware of this change including all the new members in March of 2024. The interesting part is that the Trojans administration is claiming that they had no idea of this change and this was a big part of them opting out of the rivalry series she also said.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s USC making the choice to end the battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh. They’ll have to live with decision, as it’s a very bad look for the Trojans overall.\n\nThe MOU language as it relates to Notre Dame has not changed since it was communicated to Big Ten schools last year, a second source says.\n\n— Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) December 23, 2025\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: USC’s reason for opting out of Notre Dame series has been refuted",

    "fullText": "Ahead of Arsenal’s League Cup quarter-final on Tuesday, rumours suggested Piero Hincapie was a doubt for the game with a shoulder injury.\n\nThe centre-back had clearly picked up an issue during Arsenal’s win over Everton at the weekend, and though he completed the match, the suggestion was that he might be facing a short-term absence.\n\nThat was confirmed as Hincapie was left out of Arsenal’s squad to face Crystal Palace, and things got worse on the night as Gabriel Martinelli was substituted early with an injury of his own.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Mikel Arteta confirmed injuries to the two players, though he did add that the Martinelli one is also seemingly not that serious.\n\n“Martinelli is more of a knock and he wasn’t comfortable to carry on after the second half,” Arteta said. “With Piero, yeah, something different because he picked up an injury against Everton.”\n\nMartinelli and Hincapie join Cristhian Mosquera, Ben White, Gabriel Magalhaes, Kai Havertz, and Max Dowman on the injury list, leaving Arsenal particularly short at the back.\n\nHavertz has rejoined first-team training and appears to be closing in on a comeback, but the Gunners really need defenders back too, with Hincapie and Gabriel probably the two closest.\n\nArsenal will be back in action on Saturday at 3pm, facing Brighton & Hove Albion in a Premier League game. So it won’t be long until we know whether Martinelli and Hincapie are in line for immediate returns.",

    "fullText": "Did you make it to your Fantasy League's championship? If so, congrats are in order. More than likely, if you win, you will receive the entire buy-in to your bank account just in time for the \"New Year, New You\" craze! Or, if you were to lose, you should at least double your money, while third place gets their money back. If it's just bragging rights on the line, that's fun too! So, let's see if we can get you over the hump to be crowned the 2025 Fantasy Champion!\n\nThis is it, and you can make the right moves to do this. We believe in you! With all 32 teams playing during Week 17, you have a plethora of options.\n\nStart - Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nTrevor Lawrence is a must-start this week against the Indianapolis Colts. Since Week 13, he has been a top fantasy producer, averaging over 34 points per game.\n\nStart - Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys will face the Washington Commanders in Week 17, and the last time Prescott faced them, he threw 3 touchdown passes. Plus, the Commanders' defense is not very good right now.\n\nStart - Joe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nThe Bengals will play the Arizona Cardinals during Week 17, and this one looks like a shootout. Burrow has thrown for four touchdown passes in two of the last three weeks.\n\nSit - Aaron Rodgers, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nThe Steelers will play the Browns in Week 17, and they have given up the fourth-fewest fantasy points to opposing QBs and the second-fewest yards. With DK Metcalf suspended for two games, it may be best avoided during your championship game.\n\nSit - Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nThe Chargers will face the Houston Texans this week, who have been a nightmare for opposing QBs. The Texans have only given up an average of twelve fantasy points per game to QBs, and they are one of only two teams not to allow a rushing touchdown to an opposing quarterback—definitely something to consider.\n\nSit - Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens\n\nAs weird as it may sound, yes, I would sit Lamar Jackson against the Green Bay Packers. Even if he starts, is he truly healthy? He hasn't been good as of late, and it is just not worth chancing it this week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Fantasy Football Start 'Em, Sit 'Em Week 16: Quarterback Edition",

    "fullText": "Every transfer window, there is a player whose future becomes the defining saga of the month. This January, it looks set to be Antoine Semenyo.\n\nManchester City are in advanced talks to sign the 25-year-old Bournemouth forward, who has a £65m release clause which expires on 10 January.\n\nBBC Sport understands four other Premier League clubs – Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea - have made enquiries.\n\nIt marks the latest step in a rapid rise for London-born Semenyo, who represents Ghana internationally through his father's heritage.\n\nHe was rejected by Arsenal, Spurs and Millwall as a youngster before ending up in a West Country academy run by former Leeds and Forest Green manager Dave Hockaday.\n\nBristol City signed him in 2017, but he needed loan spells at Bath, Newport and Sunderland before breaking into the Robins' first team in 2020-21.\n\nIn January 2023, he made a £10m move to Bournemouth - and he has been improving ever since.\n\nBut why Manchester City, and why now? And do the Cherries have any chance of persuading him to stay?\n\nWhat it says about the state of the transfer market aside, £65m is a cut price fee for a Premier League winger approaching the prime of his career.\n\nSo, it is no surprise that Pep Guardiola and Manchester City are pushing hard for Semenyo now – even if his stats suggest he wouldn't be a huge improvement on the wide options they already have.\n\nSemenyo has created fewer chances per 90 minutes this season than Rayan Cherki or Jeremy Doku, and his dribble success rate is only better than Savinho among the dedicated wing men in the City senior squad.\n\nBut his product catches the eye, with a better goal and assist per game rate than Doku, Savinho, Phil Foden and Omar Marmoush – he has scored four goals and assisted two directly following a carry, the joint most of any Premier League player since the beginning of April.\n\nPlus, his style of play would offer a new dimension to City as they aim to catch Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\nConsummately two-footed, only Mohamed Salah and Cole Palmer attempted more shots than Semenyo, while his total of 69 successful dribbles is the third-highest total in the top flight.\n\n\"He can drive forward with the ball vertically, rather than Doku who comes in and out,\" former England goalkeeper Rob Green told BBC 5 Live.\n\n\"He can do that something different Pep is looking for. Short term they have their own injury problems, with Oscar Bobb out, Doku out, Marmoush away [at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) with Egypt], so he can help short term and long term.\n\n\"It does raise the question what future someone like Savinho has though.\"\n\nThe Afcon issue is no problem for Semenyo, with Ghana having surprisingly failed to qualify.\n\nAnd Guardiola was already confirmed as a fan of him earlier this season, before the transfer talk intensified.\n\n\"He's an extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinary player,\" the Spaniard insisted.\n\n\"His energy, his confidence, his movement - unbelievable. He doesn't stop running, he attacks space so well, and when he has the ball, you feel something will happen.\n\n\"He's improving every game. Players like him make this league special - always hungry, always brave.\"\n\nSemenyo's output backs up the bombast. Since the start of April, he has been directly involved in 16 Premier League goals, third only to City striker Erling Haaland and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers.\n\nHe has scored 12 league goals during this period, second only to Haaland, while he has overperformed his expected goals tally more than any player other than West Ham captain Jarrod Bowen.\n\nSemenyo has been directly involved in 20 Premier League goals in 2025, with 14 goals and six assists – making him only the second Ghana international to do so, after Tony Yeboah at Leeds in 1995.\n\nIf he is involved with one more against either Brentford on 27 December or Chelsea three days later, his tally will surpass Dominic Solanke's club record for goal involvements in a calendar year.\n\n\"He's a brilliant, brilliant player,\" former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Match of the Day. \"At 25, he is in the peak of his career as well.\"\n\nWith Semenyo having contributed to 11 of Bournemouth's 26 goals this season, Andoni Iraola would love to keep him – especially with the Cherries on a seven-match winless league run stretching back to October, which has seen them fall to 15th in the table.\n\nDespite this poor form, there remains a positive feeling around Bournemouth. Points-wise, they are closer to the top four than the bottom three.\n\nIraola is regarded as one of the most tactically astute managers in the Premier League, who has got the best out of Semenyo to the point that almost every English giant wants to sign him.\n\nAdd in new training facilities at Bournemouth and the promise of a new ground, and there is more for the Cherries to offer.\n\nFormer Bournemouth striker Sam Vokes told BBC Solent: \"I don't know why you'd want to leave that setup. I understand when so-called 'bigger' clubs come knocking, it's hard sometimes.\n\n\"But with the way he's performing and the way that Bournemouth have been doing - it looks like he's enjoying his football.\n\n\"I don't know why he'd want to do that anywhere else at the moment.\"\n\nBournemouth have only lost two games in which Semenyo has scored since his debut in 2023.\n\nNo wonder team-mate Justin Kluivert said earlier this season: \"He is incredible. He shows it every game now. He is just world class.\"\n\nManchester City spent vast sums last January because of an injury crisis and look set to add big-money signing Semenyo this time around in very different circumstances.\n\nCity are chasing Arsenal in the Premier League title race, one of four fronts both teams are competing in, and boss Pep Guardiola has decided to strengthen the right-hand side of his attack.\n\nThe Ghanaian offers pace and direct running from that flank, and it will be of great satisfaction to Guardiola that he chose City over the other options he had.\n\nBut one in means one may now leave, with Savinho or Oscar Bobb being possibly moved on to accommodate him.\n\nTottenham held talks for the Brazilian in the summer but could not agree a fee, so could they test the waters again when the transfer window opens next month?\n\nSemenyo's profile is a unique one and at the reported price point, it feels like a no-brainer.\n\nStylistically we have seen City lean into attacking in transition with more pace this season than previously under Guardiola, who has played on the strengths of Haaland, Foden, Tijjani Reijnders and Doku - attacking quickly over big distances.\n\nAs a result, City have scored from more fast breaks this season than during the entire 2023-24 and 2024-25 seasons combined.\n\nBournemouth's direct style of attack means Semenyo's pace, good hold-up play, smart decision-making and two-footed ball-striking are more easily transferred to this City side.\n\nThese are dangerous traits, especially when going long against teams that attempt to press high up the pitch.\n\nGuardiola likes versatile players too, given they provide solutions to injury crises.\n\nWith Doku out injured, Reijnders has come in and shifted Foden out to the left. Semenyo would provide Premier League proven quality on both wings.\n\n\"The years we were successful, not just the strikers [were scoring], especially the wingers, attacking midfielders. We need that,\" said Guardiola earlier this month.\n\nCity's over-reliance on Haaland's 19 goals will be something he wants to address. Foden has scored the second most with seven but has been moved away from the number 10 position, where he scores often from distance.\n\nThe signing of Semenyo would help get Foden back in the areas Guardiola feels he is most dangerous.\n\nSemenyo has the added benefit of providing goals himself while starting as a winger. With eight in the league this season, only Igor Thiago and Haaland have more.\n\nIf City want to overtake Arsenal and win the league, getting scorers behind Haaland would be a smart move.\n\nLatest Bournemouth news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Bournemouth - what do you want to know?",

Oh, how times have changed.\n\nThe Chiefs are one of six teams playing on Christmas this season, as they cap the holiday by hosting the Denver Broncos, but the shoe is on the other foot this time. It's the Broncos who are competing for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, while the Chiefs are already eliminated from playoff contention and will see their season end before the playoffs for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era.\n\nMahomes won't be involved in Kansas City's Christmas game, as he suffered a torn ACL against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 15. The injury came as the Chiefs were already staring down elimination, but it added another level of devastation to a shell-shocked organization.\n\nBefore the Chiefs and Broncos kick off on Christmas night, a pair of games between NFC teams will get the day started as the NFL's footprint on the holiday continues to expand.\n\nHere's what you need to know to watch NFL games on Christmas Day, including live streaming information.\n\nThe NFL's Christmas Day tripleheader begins with a couple of matchups sometimes seen on Thanksgiving, albeit in different buildings.\n\nThe Washington Commanders play host to the Dallas Cowboys as both teams try to pick up the pieces and build some momentum to close out the season, while the Minnesota Vikings will aim to do the same against the Detroit Lions as J.J. McCarthy tries to prove he should enter 2026 as the team's starting quarterback.\n\nIn the nightcap, the Chiefs host the Broncos in a game that once looked like it might decide the AFC West but now only impacts the Broncos as they try to earn a first-round bye in the AFC.\n\nLive stream: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe first games of the Christmas Day tripleheader will be broadcast on Netflix, with the third and final contest airing on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nIan Eagle (play-by-play), Nate Burleson and Matt Ryan will be on the call from Northwest Stadium for Cowboys vs. Commanders, while Noah Eagle (play-by-play) will make it a family affair as he calls Lions vs. Vikings alongside Drew Brees.\n\nAl Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit will call Broncos vs. Chiefs in prime-time on their typical broadcast home of Amazon Prime Video.\n\nListen to the NFL's Christmas Day slate live with SiriusXM on channel 88, NFL Radio, for the national call.\n\nCorresponding channels for team-specific calls will be released in the days leading up to the Christmas tripleheader.\n\nNew subscribers get their first month of SiriusXM for free.

    "description": "In an exclusive interview with BBC Sheffield, Sheffield Wednesday bidder David Storch shares his vision for the club.",
    "fullText": "David Storch wants to be the next owner of Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nHaving made a bid to buy the Owls last Friday, Storch faces competition from two other parties, including former Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley.\n\nBut who is he, and what is his plan for the Hillsborough club?\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BBC Sheffield, the American introduced himself and his vision - which appears to be very different from that of former owner Dejphon Chansiri.\n\n\"We have a desire to do things right, that means setting the tone at the top,\" Storch said.\n\n\"Having excellence in everything we do and a quality product — at the stadium, the training ground and academy.\n\n\"We'll bring in the right CEO (chief executive officer). We want to make sure we bring in the right sporting director.\"\n\nChansiri would often baulk at the idea of a sporting director and the club has not had a CEO since Katrien Meire left in 2019.\n\nStorch and Ashley are believed to be joined by Dunfermline owner James Bord in the running to take over at Wednesday.\n\nThe Championship club entered administration in October, which ended Chansiri's decade-long ownership.\n\nJoint-administrator Kris Wigfield said in a statement last Friday that \"genuine progress is being made\" to name a preferred bidder but with 2026 on the horizon, it is unclear who will lead the club into the future.\n\nStorch, who has also worked in the aviation services industry, is the founder and managing partner of investment firm Arise Capital Partners, working alongside his son Michael.\n\nBut why are they trying to buy one of English football's most recognisable yet troubled football clubs?\n\n\"When we went to the Wednesday game on 5 November (against Norwich), I just couldn't believe the atmosphere, the energy, the singing, the fan engagement,\" Storch said.\n\n\"Here's a team that not only is in the cellar, but you know, for certain, about to be relegated due to the point deductions.\n\n\"We came away unbelievably excited about what we saw.\"\n\nAs it happens, Storch has come close to buying several English Football League (EFL) clubs.\n\n\"We started focusing on US sports and then we started looking at English football about two-and-a-half years ago,\" he said.\n\n\"We've given serious consideration to three different clubs. We did go down the path with Rob Couhig at Reading. We took a look at Blackpool, although we quickly dismissed that one.\n\n\"Then we submitted an offer team with Gareth Bale to buy Cardiff City and actually reached agreement with Vincent Tan to purchase the club. Unfortunately, he decided to hold on and we never got that transaction complete.\"\n\nSheffield Wednesday placed in administration\n\nSheff Wed delay move to name preferred bidder\n\nSheff Wed 'days from takeover' with Ashley leading contender\n\nTaking on Sheffield Wednesday would be a significant challenge. It is a club that has not been in the Premier League for 25 years.\n\nIn that period they have been relegated to League One three times and, given their points deductions in the Championship this season, they will almost certainly make that four.\n\nBut Storch has said he has done his homework and has a clear strategy should he take over the club.\n\n\"You'll see that we have a blueprint for proper governance, fan engagement, financial stability, sustainability and football strategy,\" he said.\n\n\"I've bought into it 100% and I've insisted that all of my partners here, all of my team that's surrounding me, that they buy into that as well.\n\n\"I think the academy is critical to our strategy. We'll look to make improvements there so that players can have the right environment in which to train.\"\n\nThere had been talk of Storch joining forces with another American businessman, John McEvoy - but he revealed his bid for Wednesday has been made in partnership with Tom Costin, the co-founder and managing partner of Owl Ventures.\n\nThe company, whose name is a coincidence and not linked to Wednesday's nickname, describes itself as \"the largest venture capital firm in the world focused on education technology with over $2 billion assets under management\".\n\nCostin is an investor with the Blue Crow Sports Group - a multi-club football ownership and investment platform with controlling interests in French club Le Havre, Spanish side CD Leganes and Cancun FC in Mexico. Costin is also a board director at Le Havre.\n\n\"We recognise that this is a long journey - this is not a short term fix,\" Storch added.\n\n\"We have confidence between Tom and I, that between us, we have enough capital to get this thing going, and our plan is that as we sustain the team, and as we start making progress on the pitch, get back up in the Championship, it will be possible for us to go ahead and raise additional capital.\n\n\"I'm not doing this to own a football club. I'm doing this to make a difference. I want to give people something to feel proud about.\"\n\nStorch confirmed he made an offer for the club on Friday and said he is now waiting to hear from the administrators.\n\nThe main topic of discussion among fans currently is whether the preferred bidder will meet the EFL's '25p in the pound' rule - which requires that a club exiting administration must pay its unsecured creditors a minimum of 25p for every pound owed - to avoid a further 15-point deduction in the future.\n\n\"We've put in an offer. We feel that it's a fair offer and satisfies our interpretation of the rules and the laws of the land,\" Storch said.\n\n\"We will not move forward with a 15-point deduction. The offer that we've put in has a requirement that stipulates that we will not accept the 15-point reduction.\"\n\nThere were also recent reports suggesting the process involving the EFL's 'Owners' and Directors' Test' - plus the introduction of a new football regulator - could be a long one.\n\nWhile Storch was CEO of AAR, an aviation services company, an employee reportedly bribed the Nepalese and South African governments, leading to the company agreeing a $55m settlement in 2024.\n\nWill that be a stumbling block?\n\n\"My lawyer doesn't think so,\" Storch said.\n\n\"The circumstances that happened at the company were rather unfortunate. I have a 40-year business career that is unblemished. This was a lower-level employee that did some things they shouldn't have done. The company self-reported it.\n\n\"What I'm all about here is giving the fans something really exceptional, and restoring the past glory. I've never been rejected from anything in my life.\"\n\nLatest Sheffield Wednesday news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Sheffield Wednesday content on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "The holiday season is in full swing, and while Serie A may be pausing for a few days, the transfer rumor mill is raging on unabated. Although a few new names have been added to the mix, the Italian press continues to focus on Roma’s pursuit of Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee and Atletico Madrid midfielder Giacomo Raspadori.\n\nWhile they bring different traits to the table, Zirkzee and Raspadori have followed similar career arcs, parlaying success in Italy into megamillion moves to larger European clubs. However, with only 586 combined league minutes between them, life outside of Italy hasn’t been kind to these former Serie A standouts.\n\nFortunately, there may be hope on the horizon for these two talented attackers in the form of a curmudgeonly calcio genius. According to multiple sources in Italy, Gian Piero Gasperini has identified Zirkzee and Raspadori as the ideal salves for his wounded attack.\n\nRecent reports from Italy indicate that Roma will acquire both players on loan with options to buy (€40M for Zirkzee, €18M for Raspadori) that become obligations if certain objectives are met, including the club qualifying for the Champions League next season. This would represent a significant investment for the club and may require the corresponding sales or loan cancellations of players like Evan Ferguson, Leon Bailey, and Artem Dovbyk.\n\nThis is all speculation, of course, but the depth and breadth of these rumors suggest that Roma and Gasperini have clearly established priorities for the January transfer market. All that remains is to push the deals over the finish line, which is no easy feat with this many moving pieces.",

    "fullText": "Spanish women's soccer is at the top of the world, bearing the star of world champions. However, the ambition of this generation is insatiable, and its new leader is no stranger to the mix of success and frustration.\n\nSonia Bermúdez, a legend of Spanish soccer and newly appointed head coach in 2025, knows the weight of history and the bittersweet taste of defeat. Her appointment, following a brilliant stint in the lower categories of the RFEF, came right after the National Team fell short of European glory, losing in the final of the Women's EURO in the fateful penalty shootout.\n\nWith an eye on 2026, a crucial year to establish the project and qualify for the next World Cup, Bermúdez sets aside tactics and scouting reports to write a very special letter. From her coach's heart, this is her wish list for Santa Claus, filled with hope and with the sole aim of ensuring that Spanish dominance has no end.\n\nI know this wish list is not written by a child, but by a woman who, after more than two decades in soccer, has taken on the greatest challenge of her career: being the Head Coach of the Spanish Women's National Team.\n\nMy first months have been intense. We conquered the Nations League and felt the support of more than 55,000 voices at the Metropolitano, reaffirming our leadership. But we also suffered the setback of being just one step —one penalty— away from European glory.\n\nThat defeat in the Women's EURO Final hurt us, but it has injected us with a voracious hunger. Therefore, my wishes for 2026 are requests aimed at consolidating our hegemony and building an unbeatable future:\n\nMy first and most urgent wish is that 2026 be the year in which, without speculations or unnecessary anxieties, we secure direct qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe goal is clear: to arrive at the World Cup in full condition to defend our star and demonstrate that we are a power that not only wins but remains at the top. I ask that the team maintains ambition and that the pressure of being the current world champions propels us, rather than paralyzes us.\n\nSanta Claus, you well know that my heart is also in the grassroots, as I spent years watching these generations grow in the lower categories. Therefore, I wish that Spanish formative soccer continues to shine brightly on the international stage.\n\nWe cannot rest. I ask that investment continues in infrastructure, qualified personnel, and talent detection, so that the RFEF's player factory remains the most envied in the world. We need future \"golden generations\" to continue winning European and world titles in their categories, ensuring a quality succession that guarantees the National Team is always well-nourished.\n\nWe are world champions due to the strength of the collective, but that collective is full of talents that deserve the highest recognition. My last great wish is for Spanish players to once again be the undisputed protagonists in achieving individual titles like the Ballon d'Or and the The Best award.\n\nThis is more than a whim; it is the thermometer of the level of our league and the individual quality of our players. I ask that this recognition be the norm, not the exception, and that the mark of Spanish soccer is imprinted on all global awards.\n\nThe table is set, and the excitement is at its peak. We only need health, a bit of your magic for those moments of fortune, and the certainty that Spanish women's soccer will continue to grow without limits.\n\nWith gratitude and determination,\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇪🇸 here.\n\n📸 Mateo Villalba Sanchez - 2025 Getty Images",

But we do find time for other topics, promise.\n\n Here’s a (very) non-exhaustive list of the stories that caught our attention from Bloomberg in 2025, spanning dividends, AI romance novels, Ponzi schemes and labradoodles.The New American Hustle -- Boring and stodgy dividends are one of the new hot thing with Generation Z? Apparently so, for young people who are hellbent on finding a way to retire early.Eli Weinstein’s Second Chances -- Fraudster goes to prison, is pardoned by Trump, goes straight back to a fraud. Plus, the psychology of behind why people fall prey to Ponzi schemes.The Missing Engineers -- The world is electrifying at a, well, electrifying pace, but there aren’t enough engineers to do it. The UK’s issues, as a de-industrialised nation that looks down on manual labour, are stark.The Politics of AI Are About to Explode -- A great episode of the Odd Lots podcast on how AI could become a key issue in the US midterm elections next year, which you can extrapolate out to any countries rapidly building data centres.Murder on Rainbow Mountain -- An evangelist for tourism at Peru’s Rainbow Mountain is killed, allegedly by a mob of his own neighbours. An excellent exploration of how a rapid change in fortunes can transform communities.Rich Americans are Driving a $200 Billion Boom in Complex Bets -- It always fascinates me when financial tools which have a checkered past make a comeback. Step forward structured products, which suffered a wipeout after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and have seen multiple haywire incidents since.

    "title": "The reason you don't 'get' Zettelkasten (2022)",
    "description": "Have you thought about why you might need it? Let’s ask Umberto Eco.",
    "fullText": "This post is a translation of “Et toi, qu’est-ce que tu fiches ?”\n\nThis week, there was an online conference on linked notes, the Linking Your Thinking Conference. The event was put under the umbrella of personal knowledge management (PKM). Many authors took the opportunity to share their thoughts on the subject and I saw a bunch of articles on different methods: how to take notes, make links, manage writing projects, etc.\n\nReading through some of these, I thought about two things.\n\nFirst, I think that most of these methods can be merged. They touch on such fundamental issues that, essentially, their differences come down to marketing. David Allen’s Getting Things Done method outlined the elements of task management in such a definitive way (capture, process, create) that innovation now happens mostly at the margins. Any new, supposedly definitive method seems to me like it tries to reinvent the wheel.\n\nSecond, I’ve read the following idea several times: people enthusiastically discover interrelated note-taking tools but quickly become disillusioned, because they struggle to make sense of them. In “The essence of the Zettelkasten method, demystified” for example, author Fei-Ling Tseng complains that the aforementioned method does not come with instructions – hence the need to “demystify” it. In her case, the struggle produced something useful and clever: she imagined the Idea Compass, a series of prompts for coming up with ways to link your notes. But underlying her initial remark, I see a problem.\n\nPeople look at a tool and ask themselves, “What can I do with it?”. I’m not saying that nothing interesting can come out of this line of questioning, but it seems like a designer question, something to wonder about when your job is to push the limits of what can be done. For most of us, I think looking at the tool and asking how to use it is twice misguided: it’s the wrong question, and it formulates the problem the wrong way around.\n\nThe first question to ask is “what do I want/need to do?”. The second is “what tool can help me?”.\n\nA master’s or doctoral student in the humanities could read Umberto Eco’s How to Write a Thesis today and start using a tool like Zettlr or Obsidian right away without any problem; the only prerequisite would be to learn Markdown, which can be done in ten minutes.\n\nWhy? Because Eco’s book starts with the first question: “what do I have to do?”. In this case, the answer is: write a thesis. Eco explains the exercise perfectly, including how note-taking fits into it, which gives note-taking meaning and purpose. Management experts try to build meaning ex nihilo for their ready-made methods but it can’t make any sense to you if you haven’t considered the extrinsic needs that drive your note-taking practice.\n\nI mention How to Write a Thesis because its advice is especially timeless. This may not seem apparent depending on the edition you read.\n\nIn the one I have, the translator states that the passage of time “has rendered many of Eco’s tips rather obsoleteCantagrel, “Postface du traducteur,” 2018, p. 332.\n\n”. This may be true for the very last part, which concerns the writing, layout and printing of the manuscript, and where Eco explains that you should underline to indicate italics when you use a typewriter. But his advice on note-taking has not aged a bit. Translators for the 2015 MIT Press edition got it much better:\n\n« We have preserved Eco’s handwritten index card research system in all its detail, precisely because it is the soul of How to Write a Thesis. Obviously the card catalog of the small town library is primitive compared to today’s online research systems, but the research skills that Eco teaches are perhaps even more relevant today Mongiat Farina and Farina, “Translator’s foreword,” 2015, xvii.\n\n ».\n\nWhat Eco says about index cards (in French: fiches) is entirely applicable today, especially if you use fancy hypertextual personal documentation tools.\n\nHe explains that cards, being mobile units, form the basis of a powerful and flexible system:\n\n“You can move the index card, merge it with the others, place it before or after another card in the file.”Eco, How to write a thesis, 2015, p. 117.\n\nEco suggests that we create different types of cards according to the work we need to do: readings, themes, quotations… Each can have its own type of card. These types are applicable to any subject, because they are related to the organization of knowledge and not to the knowledge itself.\n\n“Depending on the context, we can create index cards of various types: connection index cards that link ideas and sections of the work plan; question index cards dealing with how to confront a particular problem; recommendation index cards that note ideas provided by others, suggestions for further developments, etc.”Ibid., p. 118.\n\nThese form the connective tissue of the file. They literally serve to make connections between ideas written on other cards.\n\nFinally, Eco advocates a rigorous documentary approach: make use of metadata in your cards, and make it so that the file is complete and homogeneous. This is what allows you to apprehend your work as a whole, a role fulfilled today by indexes, lists of keywords, and graph views.\n\n“Always work on homogeneous material that is easy to move and handle. This way, you will know at a glance what you have read and what remains to be read.”Ibid., p. 119.\n\nEco’s advice is still perfectly applicable today. Students who need to take notes can take it word-for-word, including when using interrelated note-taking tools.\n\nThis is where the second question comes in: “which tool can help me?” It is much easier to select the appropriate tool when you know what you need to do with it. If you’re a student who needs to compile a bibliography, take notes on your readings and synthesize your ideas, all to help with a scientific writing project, you will quickly filter out tools and find the one that can help you accomplish all this. In the case of linked notes for research, Zettlr comes to mind, along with Cosma.\n\nThis applies to other types of knowledge work. You already have goals that include the need to take notes. Knowing what they are helps you find a tool and a method that makes sense. It might be Zettlr and the Zettelkasten method. It may be an outliner like Roam or Logseq. It may be a toolbox like Obsidian or VS Code, loaded with plugins.\n\nWhere it gets complicated is when you haven’t thought about your goals beyond note-taking. Then, sure, you may feel a bit helpless when discovering Zettelkasten—just the name alone is enough to confuse you if you don’t know German…\n\nWhat’s strange, is that the underlying principles of interrelated note-taking tools should be familiar to us. It’s hypertext, which we see everytime we browse the Web. It’s association, the very mechanism that Vannevar Bush said is the basis of the way our mind operatesBush, “As We May Think,” 1945, p. 106.\n\n.\n\nBut perhaps this is why it’s difficult to grasp. It’s too generic. If you bury it under jargon, it becomes even more difficult to ‘get’. And without purpose, it makes even less sense. But put it in the context of a broader objective and then it becomes much clearer.",

    "fullText": "Warren Buffett is days away from stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO, but at age 95, he's skipping retirement to stay on as chairman. That's not a shock from the investor who \"tap dances to work.\"\n\nAfter revealing his resignation plans to Berkshire shareholders in May, Buffett said he would \"still hang around\" and \"could conceivably be useful\" to his successor, Greg Abel.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit at home and watch soap operas,\" Buffett told The Wall Street Journal after his big reveal. \"My interests are still the same.\"\n\nIn his Thanksgiving letter, Buffett said he still works at Berkshire's Omaha headquarters five days a week, and sometimes has a \"useful idea\" or gets approached with an offer.\n\nBuffett's lasting dedication isn't surprising, as he's famously devoted to Berkshire. Since taking control in 1965, he has transformed it from a failing textile mill into a world-beating conglomerate that owns scores of businesses such as Geico and NetJets, and huge stakes in public companies including Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz.\n\n\"We've got the best job in the world,\" Buffett said about himself and the late Charlie Munger during Berkshire's annual meeting in 2000. \"We get to work with people we like and admire and trust every day of the year. We get to do what we want to do, the way we want to do it.\"\n\nInvesting Berkshire's capital inside and outside the company is the \"most enjoyable thing to do in the world,\" Buffett said during the 2012 meeting. \"I get to paint my own painting,\" he continued, adding that he has \"a lot of fun\" with his coworkers.\n\nBuffett has said for decades that retirement doesn't appeal to him, and he much prefers to keep working as long as possible.\n\n\"Berkshire is my first love and one that will never fade,\" he wrote in his 1991 shareholder letter, recalling that when a student asked when he planned to retire, he replied: \"About five to 10 years after I die.\"\n\nBuffett said during Berkshire's 1996 meeting that the idea of retiring was \"unthinkable\" for him: \"That would be the worst. I think death would be second.\"",

    "fullText": "Two CEOs running multi-billion-dollar AI companies say AI can't automate work as easily as many leaders had assumed.\n\nGlean CEO Arvind Jain and Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said on an episode of the \"Bg2 Pod\" published Tuesday that companies need to temper expectations about how quickly and easily AI can be deployed.\n\nJain said he had tried to automate internal workflows at Glean, including an effort to use AI to automatically identify employees' top priorities for the week and document them for leadership.\n\n\"It has all the context inside the company to make it happen,\" said Jain, adding that he thought AI would \"magically\" do the work. The idea seemed simple, but it hasn't worked.\n\nGlean, an AI startup that helps employees search across internal tools and documents, said in September that it had raised $150 million at a $7.2 billion valuation.\n\nJain pointed to another bet that fell short: building and fine-tuning a custom model for a specific use case within Glean's product. That effort \"didn't really pan out,\" ultimately pushing the company back toward existing foundation models that were easier to deploy, he said.\n\n\"It actually takes much longer than you know to actually generate success,\" he added.\n\nGhodsi, whose company sells a data and AI platform, said: \"It's not just you can just unleash the agents, and it just works.\"\n\nMaking AI useful inside an organization is \"an engineering art,\" requiring careful evaluation, production work, and strong teams to support it, he added.\n\nDatabricks last week announced that it had raised more than $4 billion in a funding round, valuing the company at $134 billion.\n\nBoth CEOs said failed AI projects are common — and not necessarily a sign that something has gone wrong.\n\n\"You hear these 95% of projects fail,\" Jain said. \"That's actually what you want.\"\n\n\"When you're actually experimenting with new technology, if all of your projects are failing, that means you're not trying enough,\" he added.\n\nGhodsi has previously said that human oversight will remain essential in AI systems, even as companies deploy more agents and AI automate more tasks.\n\n\"I think in a few years, yes, we'll have agents in many, many places, but there will be a human overseeing and approving every step, and you're on the hook when you approve, when you click, 'OK,'\" he said in June at a conference in San Francisco. \"We all become supervisors.\"\n\nOther tech leaders have echoed that view.\n\nResearch scientist Yoshua Bengio, who is one of the \"godfathers of AI,\" said human qualities will become more important as machines take over tasks.\n\n\"Work on the beautiful human being that you can become. I think that that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs,\" Bengio said on an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast published last week.\n\n\"The human touch is going to, I think, take more and more value, as the other skills become more and more automated,\" he added.",

    "description": "From the highest unemployment in years to job switchers seeing more modest raises than years past, charts show how the job market fared in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Kanika Mohan lost count of her job applications.\n\nWith a new bachelor's degree, a slate of summer tech internships, and years of networking at campus career fairs, she hadn't expected getting a job to be this hard.\n\n\"I remember waking up every single day to at least a few rejection emails, and these emails have absolutely no personalization to them,\" Mohan, 22, told Business Insider over the summer. \"You can do three rounds of interviews, yet you'll still get a very generic, 'Sorry. You're not a good fit.\"'\n\nShe eventually landed a role at a top tech company, but months of editing cover letters, prepping for interviews, and getting ghosted had been exhausting. And brutal job search experiences like hers aren't an outlier — they've become the norm.\n\nThe job market in the US hit some major milestones this year. Unfortunately for the dozens of job seekers Business Insider has heard from, they weren't the good kind. AI, economic uncertainty, and a shift toward employer power have been felt across the workforce.\n\nTyler Sorenson knows this all too well. The Gen Zer was so frustrated by limited job vacancies and slow replies to his online applications that he began leaving paper résumés at local businesses.\n\n\"I literally just had to walk into that store and hand them an actual résumé for them to even take a look at me,\" he said in the summer. For him, that actually ended up yielding results: He was able to bypass the onslaught of AI applications and get directly to a human. It's part of just how topsy-turvy the job hunt has become.\n\nThe economic situation has everyone feeling stuck: Companies are pulling back on hiring, while people with a steady paycheck are feeling too cautious to make a move. It's culminating in a frozen job market — and Americans are feeling the chill.\n\nMillions of people are struggling to get a job — the unemployment rate as of November is the highest since 2021. Meanwhile, job openings have cooled off 37% from their high point in 2022.\n\n\"This job market is terrifying,\" Hilary Nordland, a Gen X job seeker told Business Insider over the summer. \"It's a black hole that makes you question everything — and I don't see a clear path through.\"\n\nThe number of job openings for each unemployed person has come way down over the past few years — from two openings per unemployed person in 2022 to one this past September. The number of people unemployed briefly surpassed job opportunities in July and August, which hasn't happened since the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.\n\n\"Job growth has been very slow over the course of 2025, and it doesn't seem like we've turned around quite yet to translate the pent-up demand for hiring and the recent increase in job openings into actual hires,\" Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter, said.\n\nIn 2023, Business Insider wrote about how the Great Resignation, where many workers were switching into new roles amid robust options, was pivoting into the Big Stay, where more workers would keep their jobs, whether they wanted to or not.\n\nThat shift became clearer in 2024 and persisted in 2025. The quits rate fell to 1.8% this past October, the lowest since May 2020.\n\nThe quits rate provides a good indicator of how confident workers feel about being able to transition to a new employer. The low rate means workers likely don't see many new opportunities.\n\n\"When we look at the fact that inflation is still strong, wage growth is cooling in respect to inflation, a lot of workers are maybe thinking a steady paycheck, whether it's my ideal job or not, is better than the risk of me going for something else because there's not a lot of something else out there,\" Bachaud said.\n\nOver the past few years, wage growth for job switchers had far outpaced that of their colleagues holding tight; at the peak of the Great Resignation, job switchers' paychecks were benefiting from major premiums.\n\nBut in 2025, the job switcher wage growth came down to earth, and then some. In the back half of the year, job stayers and job switchers have duked it out for who's seeing larger wage growth — a marked contrast to the larger paychecks companies dangled over potential job hoppers just a few years ago.\n\nThat's not necessarily great news for job stayers, though. On the whole, wage growth tempered for both groups, meaning less ample raises. And it's another indicator that job market power has slipped back into the hands of employers.\n\nThe share of workers who are deemed \"long-term unemployed\" — meaning they've been out of work for 27 weeks or more — has come to encompass a quarter of all unemployed Americans. That's picked up in the back half of 2025, suggesting that many had spent a solid chunk of the year jobless.\n\nFor workers thrust out of their jobs, climbing back into the fold is an ever more daunting task.\n\nClair Todd, who was laid off two years ago, said constant job rejections can make you feel like you are not good enough.\n\n\"On top of that, you have to worry about paying the bills without money coming in,\" she said. \"I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging.\"\n\nShe stopped actively looking for a new position a few months ago and instead prioritized building a website development business.\n\nThe 2025 job market was brutal for every generation, but Gen Zers are in an especially tough spot. The unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds reached 9.2% in August and September, the highest figure since the recovery from the pandemic recession.\n\n\"I was applying and I felt like, 'This is so stupid because I know I'm going to get rejected,' recent grad Bella Babbitt told Business Insider last spring.\n\nFor those with a college degree, the prospects have been especially grim. The educated 20-something unemployment rate has consistently surpassed the overall unemployment rate since 2021, and the gap has widened. It's not unusual for young people to be out of work at higher levels than the general population, but a degree has historically boosted young people's chances of landing a job. Young men were more unemployed than young women this year, in part because women tend to dominate one of the few growing sectors of the job market: healthcare.\n\nBusiness Insider has heard from dozens of Gen Zers this year. Some are pivoting from white-collar fields to more seemingly secure blue-collar work, while others said they've submitted hundreds of applications without any luck. Most felt their traditional paths to success disappeared in 2025: The Trump administration's DOGE initiative slashed opportunities in the federal workforce, AI is snapping up entry-level tasks in fields like tech, and major companies aren't hiring due to economic headwinds.\n\nThe US isn't in an official downturn, but workers and consumers had an especially bleak outlook this year.\n\nThe New York Fed asks people about how likely they think they could find a new job in the next three months if they lost their role today. The average probability fell to its lowest point in August since the survey began in 2013. It's only seen mild recovery since.\n\nWeaker worker sentiment has been paired with fewer job opportunities than a few years ago, stubborn inflation, tariff chaos, and relatively high interest rates.\n\n\"I went through months of job searching — about four to five months — and it was really scary, it was really harsh, it was really painful,\" Mohan, the recent college grad, said. \"It took a really huge emotional toll and a big toll on my mental health, too.\"\n\nJacob Zinkula contributed reporting for this story.",

    "fullText": "The holidays are all about time with family and friends. For some of us, that means pullout couches and six to a bathroom. For others, it's a villa in St. Barts or a ski house in Aspen.\n\nNow that the end of the year is upon us, the uber-wealthy are deploying their private jets and superyachts and heading to expensive destinations to enjoy vacations — and often the company of other billionaires.\n\n\"It's going to places that are exclusively pretty much high net worth,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"They want these private resorts away from everyone else.\"\n\nMany of the world's largest yachts have already sailed to warmer waters.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's yacht, Launchpad, is in the Gulf of California, not far from Cabo San Lucas.\n\nOn the other side of the continent, Jeff Bezos's Koru, David Geffen's Rising Sun, and Eric Schmidt's Whisper are among the dozens of yachts floating in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nOnce their billionaire owners are aboard, several of these ships will likely head to St. Barts to celebrate New Year's Eve.\n\n\"I always say if you want to have your toes in the sand and eat a croissant that feels like you're in Paris, St. Barts is the place for you,\" Elisabeth Brown, the membership director at the luxury concierge service Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nThose who don't stay aboard their ships can spend upward of $7,000 a night for a room — and well into five figures a night for a suite — at luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by the billionaire Bernard Arnault's LVMH.\n\nThe steep price is part of the appeal.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Chesterfield said. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"\n\nOther superrich travelers choose to embrace the winter weather.\n\n\"The holidays in the mountains are more of an escape than any other holidays, even escapes to their own remote private islands and things,\" Chesterfield said.\n\nIn Europe, that means the Alps. Gstaad, St. Moritz, Courchevel — which used to be a favorite of Russian oligarchs — and Val-d'Isère are classic choices for the ultrahigh-net-worth set, Chesterfield and Brown said.\n\nReal-estate prices continue to rise in these locations, with homes in Gstaad, the most expensive locale, costing as much as 47,300 euros, or about $55,600, per square meter, according to the property consultancy Knight Frank's 2025 Alpine Index.\n\nStateside, Aspen, Vail, and Carbondale in Colorado are among the most popular ski resorts for the ultrawealthy, Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nAspen has the highest density of homeowners worth more than $30 million in the US and the second-highest in the world, behind Monaco, according to a 2025 report by the wealth-tracking firm Altrata.\n\nHedge fund titan Ken Griffin, Walmart heir Rob Walton, and businessman Charles Koch are among the richest of those with second (or third or fourth) homes near the ski resort. Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos are regular visitors.\n\n\"It is the closest you'll get to a European après situation,\" Brown said. \"Great mountains, great skiing, the hotels are top-notch, the restaurants are awesome.\"\n\nThere's a restaurant by the chef Nobu Matsuhisa, designer shops like Gucci and Prada, and private clubs like Casa Tua and the Caribou Club to make the überrich feel at home.\n\nBut skiing is the real draw. The No. 1 interest of Aspen's ultra-high-net-worth homeowners is sports, according to Altrata.\n\nThose with more spiritual interests may prefer a different type of trip — quite literally.\n\n\"They're doing these inward journeys with psychedelics,\" Garcia said of several R360 members doing retreats in places like Peru or Costa Rica.\n\nMaybe a little plant medicine is the secret to families getting along over the holiday.\n\nThis story was initially published in December 2024 and has been updated with new information.",

    "description": "Carly Martinetti shares her approach to prioritizing mental health, remote work, and flexible scheduling.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Carly Martinetti, 35, who is based in Boston. She is cofounder of Notably, a fully remote boutique PR firm. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI used to have really bad panic disorder, to the point where I would have attacks multiple times a day. I don't even know how it was functioning, honestly. I was so ashamed. I felt like there was something wrong with me.\n\nAt my prior agencies, I don't feel that I would have been penalized per se, had I said something. But I also wouldn't have been comfortable enough because there was no one setting that example for me. That has carved out who I want to be as a leader.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the work is very important. I want to do great work. I'm a type A; I need to do well, but I also want to be realistic that if you're struggling, that takes priority.\n\nYou can't do your best work if you are not doing well mentally or physically. My work, at times, had suffered because I wasn't honest with myself about needing to take some time off when I really should have. It would have been vastly improved had I just said, \"Carly, there's nothing wrong with you. You've got a problem. You're working on it. Take a day, God forbid.\" It gave me clarity about not wanting others to go through that.\n\nThere needs to be an emphasis on work-life balance. I make a big point that I've had issues with anxiety disorders. I want you to be able to come to me if you're having a stressful situation.\n\nWhen you are working in a high-intensity industry like this one, you need to be on, but some days you're not. Setting that example is important to me — to be able to show that I'm not going to be mad if you need to take a mental health day, or step out for a little bit and lie down.\n\nI don't know if that attracts a certain type of person, but all the people who work with me are open about things they're going through in their lives. It's helpful because then I can set the tone for the day in my mind. I'll tell people, \"Hey, I know you have this big thing coming up personally, take the day off.\"\n\nI'm not saying this to toot my own horn, but it does make a better agency environment, which is known for that churn-'em-and-burn-'em mentality.\n\nWhen I was working at my last agency, before the pandemic, it was remote. That worked well for me. You can set it up so that you can be functional with a team across the country, collaborate appropriately, and get clients from wherever they may be. It felt like a no-brainer. I had worked in an office. I spent an hour plus of my day commuting. It felt like such a waste. So if there was a better way, why not take it?\n\nWe still travel, but quarterly, I would say. The vast majority of the time, we're on Zoom. We're also on Slack all the time, so I feel like I see people. We have that camaraderie. Getting together with colleagues, it's like we're continuing conversations versus, \"I haven't seen you in forever. What's new?\"\n\nWhen new people start, it's a shock to the system. I had one woman who came to me from a larger agency. She was so worried about not doing enough. She was telling me every move she was making. She was like, \"This is how I had to be at my last agency.\" She was remote there, too.\n\nI said, \"I appreciate it, but I prefer to just see the work in progress. If you need me, come to me, but I don't need to know every move you're making just because we're virtual.\"\n\nOne person at our firm is a single mom with two young kids. She needs a little bit more time away from her desk to help them. That's a very anxiety-inducing thing. She knows we're fine with her having to run out or grab them at day care and do what she needs to.\n\n\"It's PR, not ER,\" is the saying we use.\n\nMaybe you spend a little bit more time on a Friday getting something done than you would have had you not stepped out on a Thursday to do what you needed to do personally.\n\nThat give-and-take is evident. I've never had to talk to someone about taking too much time and then not doing what they needed to do for work.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "description": "Former Amazon employees detail their journey launching an AI startup, and explain how they adapted to startup life.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Shalini Aggarwal, a 50-year-old CEO in San Jose, California, and Andy Ratsirason, a 37-year-old CTO. The two left Amazon at different times and reconnected as cofounders of Tenfali, an AI startup.\n\nThey share the main processes they had to unlearn in order to successfully grow their startup. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nShalini Aggarwal: Andy and I began working together in 2015, after I relocated to the US from India. He was a dev engineer, and I worked on the product and program execution side.\n\nAndy Ratsirason: I joined Amazon for the first time in 2014 because I wanted to be part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem. I always wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I tried to tailor my career to suit that goal. I left Amazon, came back in 2020, and left again in 2023.\n\nAfter I left for the last time, I made multiple pivots in founding a startup. I realized I needed someone else to join my team. Shalini started showing up regularly on my LinkedIn feed, liking and commenting on posts about startups and taking risks, so I reached out to her. She had just left Amazon, and we reunited to cofound Tenafli.\n\nAggarwal: We quickly realized that we took a lot of systems and tools for granted when we were in an enterprise company. The startup world is completely different; here, we have to build from scratch, and there was a lot about our mindset we had to unlearn.\n\nAggarwal: I stayed at Amazon until 2024, and my last nine months were spent working on AI projects, specifically on music recommendations.\n\nRatsirason: In 2023, I was almost three years into my return to Amazon, and I had a choice: either stay comfortable with those Big Tech paychecks or take a leap and launch my own startup. I submitted my resignation in February and then began to think about what was next.\n\nAggarwal: My decision to leave Amazon was more of a gradual process. During the COVID pandemic, my father retired, and we lost my mom. I could see how lonely my father was, and the biggest challenge was how to fill his days. That planted the seed.\n\nThrough working on personalized AI recommendations, I thought of a product that could serve as an AI companion for older adults, providing personalized recommendations and scheduling activities based on their typical daily routines.\n\nMy 50th birthday was coming up, and the AI boom was happening; if I didn't take the leap then, I knew I would never. In September 2024, I put in my two weeks' notice and left Amazon.\n\nRatsirason: At Amazon, I didn't really think about why we were building a product or if people would use it. The 'build-first' mindset meant focusing solely on building a good product, knowing the customer was already there.\n\nA clear moment that this mindset wouldn't work at an early-stage startup came after we spent months building, and launch day arrived, almost nobody showed up organically for a few weeks. That was the wake-up call: shipping isn't the finish line when we didn't have demand.\n\nAfter that, we shifted to doing customer conversations earlier and running small distribution tests, including waitlists, partnerships, and community posts, before over-investing in product.\n\nAggarwal: We applied and were accepted into several startup resource programs, including AWS Activate, Nvidia Inception, and Google's Cloud Credits program.\n\nRatsirason: We received a few thousand in AWS credits, but before we realized it, we lost almost all of the credits in the first two months. We over-provisioned capacity, and during AI testing, we left a few resources running longer than intended, which quietly accumulated costs over time.\n\nOnce we noticed the issue, we set up AWS budget alerts, added cost monitoring, made shutdowns part of our testing checklist, and simplified certain aspects of the architecture to match our stage.\n\nTo reduce costs further, we also bought a small local machine to run some of our AI experiments on, so we only use the cloud when we truly need it for scale, managed services, or production.\n\nAggarwal: The time we save with AI enables us to allocate our energy to attending summits, forums, and programs, where we can learn about the work of others in the field. We also spend more time with prospective customers doing interviews.\n\nRatsirason: We used to spend hours reading long articles and research, and trying to keep up with the latest news in the field. The cycle felt heavy and slow, pulling us away from customer conversations and shipping.\n\nWe now use AI to scan a large set of content, surface the most relevant ideas for us, and summarize the few pieces worth reading. Having to be frugal, we've learned to spend only where learning happens. Talk to users first, then build the smallest thing that can prove value.\n\nRatsirason: AI acts as a junior engineer, handling a lot of the coding for us with the requirements we set up.\n\nAggarwal: It's also taught us where we won't need to scale. I know I don't need to hire a user interface designer. If I understand the requirements of something, I can quickly draft it with the help of AI and receive feedback on it myself.\n\nRatsirason: A few years ago, launching a usable version of our product, Agefully, would have required significantly more capital and head count. We just need two engineers and subscriptions. I'm grateful to be part of this AI era.\n\nAggarwal: We've seen at scale how things work and what processes we can implement to avoid chaos later on. At the same time, the biggest disadvantage has been overcoming the mindset that tools and infrastructure are readily available. Until we learned how to work through that, we weren't allocating our energy properly.\n\nRatsirason: Coming from Amazon, the name itself has some positive weight, but it can also work against us. People might assume that since we worked at a big company, we don't know how to run a small startup because we don't have a lot of resources.\n\nThe hardest part was overcoming the fear of shipping something imperfect. Coming from Big Tech, we were accustomed to high-polish expectations and assumed anything less would turn users away. We learned that in early-stage startups, the real risk isn't rough edges, it's building something people don't need.\n\nDo you have a founder story to share?

    "description": "Geoffrey Hinton, the \"Godfather of AI,\" said he's \"not convinced\" the age of AI scaling is over, like his former student Ilya Sutskever recently said.",
    "fullText": "Not everyone in AI is ready to declare the end of the age of scaling.\n\n\"I'm not convinced it's completely over,\" Geoffrey Hinton, the \"Godfather of AI,\" recently told Business Insider, weighing in on one of the hottest debates in AI circles this year.\n\nHinton is aware that OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, one of his former students, said last month that the pendulum of AI development is swinging back toward research — and away from companies simply making breakthroughs by scaling, or acquiring more compute and more chips.\n\n\"Is the belief really: 'Oh, it's so big, but if you had 100x more, everything would be so different?' It would be different, for sure. But is the belief that if you just 100x the scale, everything would be transformed? I don't think that's true,\" Sutskever said on an episode of the \"Dwarkesh Podcast.\"\n\n\"So it's back to the age of research again, just with big computers,\" added Sutskever, who is now running his own AI startup.\n\nHinton said there will always be a need for more data. (Another issue facing scaling is the finite amount of high-quality data.) He predicted that the large chatbots will start generating their own data, as Google DeepMind's AlphaGo and AlphaZero do on a much smaller scale to master the board game Go.\n\n\"Nobody's worried about a lack of data because it plays against itself and generates data that way,\" Hinton said of the early program. \"And the equivalent for a language model is when it starts reasoning and saying, 'Look, I believe these things and these things imply that thing, but I don't believe that thing, so I'd better change something somewhere.' And by doing reasoning to check the consistency of his own beliefs, it can generate a lot more data.\"\n\nScaling is at the very core of Big Tech's capex spending spree, a bet based on the belief that by acquiring more compute or training data, AI models will continue to grow smarter and more advanced.\n\nIncreasingly, some AI leaders have expressed uncertainty about making their future bets based on their trust in scaling. Alexandr Wang, now head of Meta's superintelligence division, said in 2024 that scaling is \"the biggest question in the industry.\"\n\nYann LeCun, who worked with Hinton on pioneering AI research, has also challenged the extent of the scale doctrine.\n\n\"You cannot just assume that more data and more compute means smarter AI,\" LeCun said in April when he was still Meta's chief AI scientist. Like Sutskever, LeCun has since launched his own startup.\n\nSutskever said scaling has been attractive because it allows companies to make a \"very low-risk way\" bet on AI advancements.\n\nIn contrast, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said that scaling laws could ultimately unlock the biggest and most elusive prize in AI: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.\n\n\"The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system,\" Hassabis said at the Axios' AI+ Summit in December. \"It could be the entirety of the AGI system.\"",

    "title": "3 surprises that could rattle markets in 2026, according to Morgan Stanley",
    "description": "Morgan Stanley said it is eyeing a productivity boost and a changing regime for stocks and bonds as potential surprises in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Forecasters largely expect more good times ahead for the stock market next year, but there are always surprises and risks that could upend the outlook.\n\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley flagged three such curveballs that could ding markets next year, laying out what they believe could be the big surprises of 2026.\n\nThe bank is one of many on Wall Street that's calling for another bright year for stocks. In its year-ahead outlook, it estimated the S&P 500 would climb another 13% in 2026, thanks to strong corporate earnings and a \"rolling recovery\" that will spread throughout the US economy.\n\n\"A year without surprises would be a surprise itself,\" a team led by Matthew Hornbach wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nHere are the top three surprises the bank is eyeing in 2026.\n\nThe US economy could see a \"jobless productivity boost,\" a turbocharged version of a \"jobless recovery\" that weighs on inflation and opens the door to more Fed rate cuts.\n\nIn this scenario, a weakening US job market would help keep a lid on wage growth and inflation, while accelerating productivity helps keep growth steady, Hornbach wrote. In such a scenario, core inflation could fall below 2%, he estimated.\n\n\"This supply-driven disinflation gives the Fed room to cut policy rates into accommodative territory without investors worrying about a policy-induced inflationary reacceleration,\" he said, adding it could also quell investor anxiety about growing deficits in the US.\n\nLabor productivity growth already looks to be on the rise. Output per hour among all nonfarm business workers rose to 3.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, up from the prior quarter's 1.8% annual decrease, Labor Department data shows.\n\nInvestors are also pricing in a more ambitious pace for rate cuts next year than the central bank has officially projected. Fed officials have penciled in just one cut for 2026, though investors are pricing in a 72% chance that rates will end the year lower, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nStock prices typically trade inversely to bond prices, as a decline in risk assets causes investors to seek safety in bonds.\n\nThat dynamic was turned on its head in 2025, with stock and bond prices both gaining steadily all year. That's partly because stocks have been mired in a bad-news-is-good-news regime lately, Morgan Stanley said, referring to how weak economic data has been positive for stocks, as it's elicited optimism from investors about Fed rate cuts.\n\nBut that dynamic could reverse once again if inflation falls back to the Fed's target next year, they said. US Treasurys are seen both as a safe haven and a hedge against inflation.\n\n\"With inflation expectations at target — and at risk of falling below — a return of 'bad-is-bad' for risky assets brings back the hedging qualities of Treasuries that made them a ballast in investor portfolios throughout the low inflation experienced in the two-decade period prior to the pandemic,\" Martin Tobias and Eli Carter, two strategists at the bank, wrote.\n\nCommodities, including energy, enjoyed a big run in 2025 and could be headed for a repeat in 2026. That's due to a series of events that could cause commodity prices to \"erupt,\" strategists speculated:\n\n\"The weaker dollar and strong consumption story from China pushes energy prices — including gasoline which is currently below 5-year lows — to new highs,\" the bank said.\n\nForecasters generally expect 2026 to be a positive year for energy prices and commodities as a whole, thanks to factors like tight supply, rising demand due to the AI trade, and increased appetite for safe-haven assets.\n\nGold, one such safe-haven, climbed past $4,400 for the first time on Monday, notching a new record. The metal is up almost 70% this year, set to close out its best annual performance since 1979.\n\nSilver and coper, both metals at the center of the AI trade, also hit new all-time highs this week.",

    "fullText": "Influencer and WWE wrestler Logan Paul said young investors should consider nontraditional assets over the stock market as he prepares to auction a rare Pokémon card he bought for almost $5.3 million.\n\n\"If you're young, there are ways to spend and invest your money in ways that might mean more to you than in a traditional conservative environment like the stock market,\" Paul said while appearing on Fox Business's \"The Big Money Show\" on Tuesday.\n\nHe said younger investors should consider investing in items such as sports memorabilia, trading cards, fossils, and art over traditional stocks.\n\n\"I think if you have the money, don't be afraid to take a risk, especially if you're young,\" Paul said.\n\nDuring the interview, Paul wore his PSA Grade 10 Pikachu Illustrator card around his neck, describing it as the \"rarest and most valuable card in the world.\"\n\nIn April 2022, Guinness World Records confirmed that Paul had broken the record for buying the most expensive Pokémon trading card sold in a private sale.\n\nPaul paid about $5.28 million for the card, which he said he bought after \"someone gave me way too much money as an adult.\" The card is expected to go to auction in early 2026.\n\nAsked whether collectibles, such as trading cards, could be a fad, Paul said that it was \"entirely possible\" and advised caution. He said he tends to buy at the \"top of the asset class.\"\n\nPokémon cards have provided a roughly 3,821% monthly cumulative return between 2004 and August 2025, according to an index by analytics firm Card Ladder.\n\nIn October 2025, Business Insider contributor Santiago Barraza Lopez wrote about how ChatGPT recommended that he invest in Pokémon cards, citing scarcity and nostalgia-driven demand, as an alternative to the volatile stock market.\n\nAlternative investments can include cryptocurrencies, commodities such as gold and natural gas, as well as collectibles like vintage cars, artworks, and Pokémon cards.\n\nAll investments carry risk, but trading cards can come with additional challenges, including counterfeiting, a lack of income generation, and a history of collectibles that failed to hold their value, such as Beanie Babies and NFTs.\n\nMillennials seem to be more inclined to spend on alternative investments than older generations, according to an October 2025 report from Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nThe report found that millennials allocate about 20% of their portfolios to alternative investments, compared with 6% for baby boomers and 11% for Gen X.",

    "description": "John Stecher reads about technology in another industry on his daily subway ride to work and spends his weekends being hands-on with tools.",
    "fullText": "The role of chief technology officer is in a constant state of evolution with the advancement of artificial intelligence.\n\nOver the last two decades of his career, Blackstone CTO John Stecher has watched technology move from a \"magic thing in the back office\" to the forefront of every business, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Technology wasn't looked at as being an absolute must-have in a business, but it is now,\" Stecher said. \"If you have any type of creaky infrastructure technology-wise, it doesn't matter which industry you're in, you're not going to be successful.\"\n\nAs the executive overseeing Blackstone's technology, cybersecurity, early-stage technology investment, and portfolio tech optimization teams, Stecher is responsible for keeping one of the world's largest investment firms competitive. That means he needs to stay ahead of the curve on everything from cyber threats to engineering advancements. Stecher shared the daily and weekly upskilling habits he relies on to do just that.\n\nWhen Stecher isn't managing the technology behind the investing giant Blackstone, he keeps himself busy with his 11-year-old and 8-year-old children. That means making the most of any free time he gets — including his 35-minute subway ride to and from the office.\n\nThe CTO said it's \"just enough\" time to come up to speed with something on his way to work, and decompress on his way home. Stecher said he typically reads news articles or research papers about applied technology in an industry outside finance, such as aircraft, robotics, or pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"You learn a ton about just how to apply different technologies in your industry, if you read about how somebody else did it elsewhere,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said that he then takes those learnings and discusses them with his colleagues.\n\n\"I, fortunately, have a bunch of amazing engineers I work with, so I have my day-to-day banter with them about what works and what doesn't,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said he can't learn by reading alone; he needs to be hands-on with technology. The CTO said part of the reason he studied computer science is so he can build and take apart the components inside a computer — and that hasn't changed.\n\n\"You can create so many unique software applications, no different than if you're drawing on a piece of paper,\" Stecher said.\n\nHe said \"the technology under the covers looks the same,\" regardless of whether you're working with an oil and gas company or a dating app like Bumble, he said. The CTO said that part of his upskilling routine involves toying around with new technology. Stecher said he aims to reserve one or two hours on the weekend to be \"hands-on\" with a tool he hasn't used before.\n\nFor example, he said he may build a tool that makes it easier for him to parse a document for work, such as the many investment committee memos he reads over the weekend.\n\nStecher said his experimentation isn't always \"spectacular.\" Sometimes it's as simple as using Claude, Anthropic's AI chatbot, to write code to automate his home. However, he said that solving everyday problems, such as turning off the lights or adjusting the thermostat, is a \"fun\" challenge that involves revisiting the basics of engineering.\n\n\"It's tactile and tangible,\" Stecher said.",

    "description": "After years of broken promises and false starts, driverless taxis finally hit the road in a big way in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Buckle up: the robotaxi race is heating up.\n\nAfter years of missed targets and false starts, driverless taxis finally hit the road in a big way in 2025. There are now seven cities in the US where you can hail a robotaxi, although some services still require a human safety driver.\n\nWaymo, Tesla, and Uber all launched robotaxis in new markets this year — and they have more planned for 2026.\n\nGoogle-backed Waymo led the way, stating in a December 10 blog that it had served more than 14 million trips in 2025 so far, more than triple the total from last year. The Google-backed company also expanded to Austin and Atlanta, started operating on freeways, and announced plans for its first overseas expansion in London.\n\nUber, which abandoned its own in-house robotaxi unit in 2020, has also gone all in on robotaxis. The ride-hailing company has formed a series of partnerships with startups to introduce robotaxis across the US and abroad. Its CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, described driverless taxis as a \"trillion-dollar-plus\" opportunity in a December interview with Bloomberg.\n\nTesla, meanwhile, launched its own robotaxi service in Austin in June. CEO Elon Musk has said that autonomous vehicles will help turn Tesla into the world's most valuable company, and the automaker is going on a hiring spree and testing robotaxis without a driver in Austin as it scrambles to meet the billionaire's ambitious deadlines.\n\nWith the robotaxi rollout ramping up, here's where you can take a ride in a driverless car in the US.\n\nSan Francisco is the birthplace of the US robotaxi industry, and the city remains the best option for taking a spin in a driverless taxi.\n\nWaymo has offered paid rides to the public, via the Waymo One app, in the city since mid-2024. Amazon-backed Zoox also launched public access to its toaster-shaped, steering wheel-less robotaxis in November, but you need to \n\nTesla also launched a ride-hailing service in San Francisco in July, but with a big caveat. The vehicles are not technically classified as robotaxis, as they use Tesla's commercially available Full-Self Driving (supervised) technology and are monitored by a safety driver.\n\nUnlike Waymo and Zoox, Tesla does not have the required permits to operate a driverless ride-hailing service in California, which has some of the country's strictest robotaxi regulations.\n\nOutside Silicon Valley, the number of cities with driverless cars on the road is growing rapidly. Waymo's vehicles are also available in Los Angeles and Phoenix via the Waymo One app, and on Uber in Atlanta and Austin, thanks to its partnership with the ride-hailer.\n\nIn Austin, Waymo is squaring off against Tesla's robotaxi service. Tesla's vehicles in Austin, which can be hailed via the company's Robotaxi app, still have safety monitors in the passenger seat and the driver's seat on freeways.\n\nTesla is racing to remove them, however, with Musk telling investors in October the company's robotaxis would be fully driverless \"in at least parts\" of Austin by the end of the year. In early December, the billionaire said Tesla had started testing robotaxis without a human safety monitor in the city.\n\nRobotaxi enthusiasts wanting to ride a driverless Tesla in Austin may face a bit of a wait, however. Tesla's service has been dogged by lengthy waiting times and currently only includes 31 active vehicles, according to a community tracker run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna.\n\nMusk said in October that Tesla would aim to have 500 robotaxis operating in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nBeyond Waymo and Tesla, Uber launched an autonomous taxi service in Dallas with safety drivers with startup Avride in December.\n\nZoox has also started offering free, fully driverless robotaxi rides in Las Vegas via its app, and Atlanta residents can use Lyft to hail an autonomous vehicle with a safety driver developed by Michigan-based startup May Mobility.\n\nThe real action, however, is set to come next year.\n\nWaymo and Tesla are planning to bring their driverless taxis to a dizzying number of new cities in 2026, with both confirming plans to launch robotaxi operations in Miami, Dallas, and Houston.\n\nWaymo is also targeting passenger services in San Antonio, Orlando, San Diego, and Washington, DC, next year, while Tesla is aiming to hit the road in Las Vegas and Phoenix.\n\nTesla is set to begin production on the Cybercab, its dedicated robotaxi, which does not have a steering wheel and pedals, in April next year.\n\nNext year, Uber plans to hit the accelerator on its own self-driving plans.\n\nThe ride-hailing company struck a partnership with German carmaker VW in April to put thousands of autonomous minivans on the road in multiple US cities, starting with LA in 2026.\n\nUber is also partnering with EV maker Lucid and AI startup Nuro to launch \"20,000 or more\" robotaxis in dozens of markets across the globe.\n\nThe three companies announced in November that the new platform will debut in late 2026 in San Francisco, adding another player to Silicon Valley's already-crowded robotaxi market.",

    "fullText": "The US telecommunications licensing authority, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has placed various drones and drone parts from foreign drone manufacturers such as DJI and Autel on the \"Covered List,\" a blacklist of communication products and services that pose an unacceptable risk to US security. They may no longer be operated in the USA and therefore can no longer be imported. The FCC announced this on Monday (PDF). The decision is based on an assessment by an interagency panel convened by the US government, which had previously examined and evaluated the national security risks posed by drones produced abroad.\n\nSpecifically, the FFC's decision is based on the finding that specific, foreign-made drones and drone components pose \"unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and the safety of US citizens.\" In its announcement, the FCC states that hostile foreign actors and terrorists could use the aircraft to \"pose new and serious threats to our homeland.\" This also includes the possibility that foreign-made drones could be used for \"attacks and disruptions, unauthorized surveillance, exfiltration of sensitive data, and other UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) threats to the homeland.\" In this context, the FCC mentions various major events planned in the USA, such as the FIFA World Cup 2026, the America250 celebrations, and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nIn addition, US security authorities fear that a dependence on foreign-made drones could weaken the US industrial base in the drone sector.\n\nExceptions, which drones, drone classes, or drone components are still permitted, can be communicated to the FCC by the Department of War or the Department of Homeland Security. The FCC itself cannot update the \"Covered List\" independently but is bound by decisions from expert panels of national security authorities.\n\nThe FCC emphasizes that the current conditions apply only to new drones and their components. Drone products previously approved under the FCC equipment authorization are not affected.

    "fullText": "State department accuses group of pressuring tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints through regulation of disinformation\n\nThe state department has barred five Europeans from the US, accusing them of leading efforts to pressure tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints, in the latest attack on European regulations that target hate speech and misinformation.\n\nSecretary of state Marco Rubio said the five people targeted with visa bans – who include former European Commissioner Thierry Breton – have led “organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states – in each case targeting American speakers and American companies,” Rubio said in an announcement.\n\nIn recent months, Trump officials have ordered US diplomats to build opposition to the European Union’s landmark Digital Services Act (DSA), which is intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation, but which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on US tech companies.\n\nLate on Tuesday night, Breton posted on social media: “Is McCarthy’s witch hunt back?”\n\nTuesday’s move is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, those targeted will generally be barred from entering the US, and some may face removal proceedings if already in the country.\n\nRubio did not name those targeted, but under secretary for public diplomacy Sarah Rogers identified them on X, accusing the individuals of “fomenting censorship of American speech”.\n\nThe five named were: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index’; and former EU commissioner Breton.\n\nThe visa bans come after the administration’s National Security Strategy this month said European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk “civilisational erasure” for the continent.\n\nRogers called Breton – who served as the European Commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024 – “a mastermind” of the DSA.\n\nMelford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), said in a video posted online in 2024 that she co-founded the organisation “to try to break the business model of harmful online content” by reviewing online news websites to allow advertisers to “choose whether or not they want to fund content that is polarising and divisive and harmful, or whether they want to steer their advertising back towards more quality journalism.”\n\nA spokesperson for GDI called the US action “immoral, unlawful, and un-American” and “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”\n\nMost Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don’t necessarily need visas to come into the US. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.\n\nWith Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "fullText": "Most “AI on data” programs are just semantic-layer maximalism with a new paint job: if we can finally standardize meaning, the model will finally reason accurately.\n\nIt won’t. A perfect semantic layer is neither sufficient nor operable. The bottleneck is organizational semantics at runtime, not SQL.\n\nSemantic layers are designed as a governed interface for humans to retrieve numbers, not to inhabit meaning. They capture the clean, declarative surface area of truth and omit the messy parts that determine whether an answer is correct.\n\nThe majority of what makes metrics usable is missing:\n\nMeaning is contextual, not global. The same metric name can legitimately refer to different implementations across product lines, geos, channels, or lifecycle stages. A semantic layer encourages flattening this into one “definition” under the guise of governance.\n\nDefinitions are political and time-bound. Ownership sits with the business, priorities shift quarterly, and what “counts” changes accordingly. Static interfaces pretend meaning is stable when it’s negotiated.\n\nOperational intelligence is non-declarative. “How do I interpret this?” is rarely answered by a formula. You need causal folk models, known anomaly patterns, failure modes, and the “if X then check Y” heuristics that live in experienced operators.\n\nTemporal continuity matters. Most metrics have version histories, instrumentation changes, backfills, silent breaks, and embarrassing periods everyone learned to discount. That context is mostly narrative, not schema.\n\nRelationships are about trade-offs, not joins. Real decision-making depends on tensions (optimize A, damage B), guardrails, and strategic intent. Semantic layers describe entities; they don’t encode the organization’s trade-off graph.\n\nStakeholder meaning diverges by role. “Revenue” for the CFO and “revenue” for the Sales VP are not the same question even when the number is the same. A single canonical definition is a UI convenience masquerading as epistemology.\n\n“Now what?” is the point. An AI that returns a metric without the response protocol is doing the easy half. Runbooks and escalation paths are part of meaning.\n\nA semantic layer can be perfect and still produce garbage decisions because it’s optimized for consistency over situated correctness.\n\nEven if you wanted to cram the missing knowledge into a semantic layer, the maintenance model collapses under its own sociology.\n\nCentralized semantic layers are planned cities: beautiful in the blueprint, empty in practice. Semantics evolve at the edges, among the people who ship, sell, operate, and get paged. The center cannot keep up, and it cannot compel truth.\n\nIn hindsight, failure modes are predictable:\n\nThe experts who can write it won’t. Deep metric knowledge is held by high-leverage operators; their marginal hour is never best spent authoring centralized documentation that mostly helps strangers.\n\nCentral teams are paced by infrastructure, not decisions. The business iterates weekly; the data platform iterates on quarters. Any interface maintained on platform cadence becomes stale, then distrusted, then ignored.\n\nTight coupling blocks shipping. If semantic context lives “in the data layer,” every AI feature becomes dependent on an always-incomplete canonicalization project. Data is never “done,” so AI velocity becomes permanently hostage.\n\nIncentives are inverted. Producers don’t benefit from documenting; consumers can’t document correctly; owners of context are neither staffed nor accountable for semantic hygiene in a centralized model.\n\nCold-start kills adoption. Semantic layers only feel useful after critical mass; reaching critical mass requires upfront drudgery with delayed payoff. Organizations don’t fail because they’re lazy; they fail because the payoff horizon is mispriced.\n\nSo you get shadow metrics, spreadsheet truth, ad hoc definitions, and a semantic layer that exists primarily as a compliance artifact.\n\nWe know what system reliably captures messy, contested knowledge at global scale without centrally curated ontologies - a wiki.\n\nWikipedia works because it’s a sociotechnical pattern that fits reality:\n\nYour organization’s meaning is closer to Wikipedia than to Encyclopedia Britannica. Treat it that way.\n\nStop trying to make the semantic layer the source of meaning. Make it a compiled artifact derived from a living knowledge substrate.\n\nBuild an internal wiki where operators and business analysts can capture what they already know. Then put the wiki in the loop with AI. The key point here is not documentation for the sake of documentation; it's feedback coupling.\n\nThis creates a virtuous cycle: usage drives coverage → coverage improves AI →  improved AI increases usage → and the knowledge base converges because it is continuously exercised under real demand.\n\nWe can still have governed models, dimensional abstractions, and metric layers. But they should be downstream, being generated or validated against the wiki, instead of being treated as the place meaning lives.\n\nThis inversion matters because it reframes the work from “build the perfect semantic layer” to “capture organizational meaning where it actually exists, then compile interfaces from it.”\n\nThe wiki becomes the organization’s brain: a living memory of intent, interpretation, exceptions, and procedures. AI becomes the octopus arms: executing queries, generating analyses, navigating ambiguity, and feeding new information back into the brain.\n\nIf your AI on data initiative isn't gaining adoption, it’s probably not because your semantic layer is imperfect. It’s because you’re trying to encode a living, political, temporal, role-dependent system of meaning into a centralized, static interface.",

    "description": "Researchers from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland VA showed restoring the brain’s energy balance led to both pathological and functional recovery.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Andrew Pieper, senior author of the study.\n\nCLEVELAND – For over a century, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been considered irreversible. Consequently, research has focused on disease prevention or slowing, rather than recovery. Despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, there has never been a clinical trial of a drug for AD with an outcome goal of reversing disease and recovering function.\n\nNow, a research team from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has challenged this long-held dogma in the field. They tested whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover.\n\nThe study, led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, from the Pieper Laboratory, published today in Cell Reports Medicine. Through studying diverse preclinical mouse models and human AD brains, the team showed that the brain’s failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD+, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD+ balance can prevent and even reverse the disease.\n\nNAD+ levels decline naturally across the body, including the brain, as people age. Without proper NAD+ balance, cells eventually become unable to execute critical processes required for proper functioning and survival. In this study, the team showed that the decline in NAD+ is even more severe in the brains of people with AD, and that this also occurs in mouse models of the disease.\n\nWhile AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been engineered to express genetic mutations that cause AD in people. The researchers used two of these models. One line of mice carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing, and the other mouse line carried a human mutation in the tau protein. Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD, and both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission, and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage. These mice also develop severe cognitive impairments that resemble what is seen in people with AD.\n\nAfter finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively. The study was based on their previous work, published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, showing that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab.\n\nRemarkably, not only did preserving NAD+ balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events caused by the genetic mutations. Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function. This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting a potential biomarker for future clinical trials.\n\n“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. “Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain’s NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer’s.”\n\nDr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).\n\nThe results prompt a paradigm shift in how researchers, clinicians, and patients can think about treating AD in the future. “The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Dr. Pieper. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”\n\nDr. Chaubey further explained, “Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.”\n\nDr. Pieper emphasized that currently available over the counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD+ under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD+ to supraphysiologic levels.\n\n“This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” said Dr. Pieper.\n\nThis work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, co-founded by Dr. Pieper.\n\n“This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” Dr. Pieper explained. “Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.”\n\nChaubey, Kalyani et al. “Pharmacologic reversal of Alzheimer’s disease in mice reveals potential therapeutic nodes in human brain.” Cell Reports Medicine. DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102535\n\nTags:\r\n Alzheimer's Disease, Aging",

    "fullText": "Fighting Drought and Heat: The Science of Growing Climate-Resilient Christmas Trees\n\nAs Christmas trees face mounting challenges from climate change, researchers explore solutions to help ensure that a beloved holiday tradition endures in a warming world.\n\nKendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American’s Science Quickly, I’m Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.\n\nThe Christmas tree feels like a tradition from time immemorial—and in some ways it is. Historians trace the use of evergreens in winter festivals as far back as ancient Egypt and Rome. But the modern American custom has more recent roots: to the 1800s and German immigrants in Pennsylvania. These immigrants are believed to have brought the practice to their new home in the U.S.\n\nThe tree custom gained even more traction when it appeared in an adapted sketch of Queen Victoria and her German-born husband and their children that was published in a U.S. women’s magazine. Many credit it with kicking off a trend that has endured to today.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nAnd while a number of people in recent years have opted for lower-maintenance synthetic trees, many revelers still prefer the look and smell of real trees. But because of climate change natural Christmas trees and their fans are facing new threats.\n\nToday we talk to Priya Rajarapu, an assistant professor and Christmas tree extension specialist at Oregon State University, about the risks tree growers are weathering and what, if anything, can be done.\n\nSo, Priya, what exactly do you do?\n\nPriya Rajarapu: [The] most simplest way I could explain is: when you are sick you call a doctor, and when Christmas trees are sick growers usually reach out to me.\n\nPierre-Louis: What kinds of trees are Christmas trees, and how are they typically grown?\n\nRajarapu: So Christmas trees are all usually fir trees or evergreens, and there’s a history behind it. Evergreens tend to keep their needles throughout the season. So it’s a symbolism of hope, so Christmas is usually celebrated around that. It’s also looking forward to the spring and harvest season.\n\nAnd Christmas trees, although they are evergreens that you see mostly in forests, they are an important agricultural commodity in the U.S. We sell [roughly] 14 million Christmas trees, as of 2022 survey in the U.S. ...\n\nRajarapu: And the four major Christmas-tree-producing states include Oregon, North Carolina, Washington and Michigan.\n\nPierre-Louis: So we really are talking about a farmed product, and I don’t think most people typically picture Christmas trees the same way that we think of, say, corn or potatoes. What makes a farmed tree different from the trees that I see in the forest?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, I’m glad you mentioned the corn and potato analogy because that’s the best way to view Christmas trees, too, is that they are grown similar to corn and potatoes or any other vegetable crops. It’s just that it’s a specialty crop—it’s a tree, so it has a longer rotation. So corn, you can get a crop in an ear ...\n\nRajarapu: But Christmas tree, you’re harvesting the tree. Then you have to wait anywhere, depending on the species, from five to 10 years to harvest a tree.\n\nAnd the difference between the trees that are grown on farm and the trees that grow in the forest is that the trees that are grown [in] the farm are cultured ...\n\nRajarapu: Meaning they are pruned to give you that perfect Christmas tree shape, the typical triangle shape that you see. So growers invest a lot of time in culturing and pruning the trees so the trees can become bushier and fuller for people to hang more ornaments and not see the stem or branch.\n\nPierre-Louis: To kind of avoid the sad Charlie Brown Christmas tree.\n\nRajarapu: But there are—there is a customer base who still likes Charlie Brown Christmas trees, so there is a pretty decent-sized consumer base for natural trees or natural-looking trees.\n\nPierre-Louis: One of the parts of the work that you do is sort of looking at the pressures of climate change on tree production. And so what kinds of pressures are you seeing?\n\nRajarapu: So I would say the changing temperatures and lesser precipitation. So we are getting more and more days with less precipitation, so there are years where there is no precipitation for 100 days in Pacific Northwest, which does pose a lot of challenge for keeping trees healthy and also seedlings alive.\n\nSo for every Christmas tree that’s cut there is at least another two seedlings that are going back in the ground. So it, it’s a [roughly] 10-year rotation, so grower has to keep his crop going, so he or she plants trees every year in the ground, and that first year of growth or seedling establishment after transplanting them into the field or farm is very crucial. So when there is drought or when there is higher temperatures and lesser precipitation, it’s hard for that particular seedling to stay alive and establish itself. So that is one of the key challenges that growers are seeing with the changing weather patterns.\n\nAnd also, another change that I’ve noticed is [the] type of site that you choose for your species can also stress the trees and can attract insects such as bark beetles or twig weevils that were occasional pests—now their frequency is increasing.\n\nPierre-Louis: Because the climate is getting warmer?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, because of the warmer climate and also lesser precipitation or no precipitation in Pacific Northwest. I’ve been in North Carolina, and it rains a lot. There, flooding is an issue. But in Pacific Northwest in summer, it’s dry.\n\nPierre-Louis: And that’s not normal, right? Like, in the past you wouldn’t get 100 days without rain.\n\nRajarapu: Correct. What I hear from growers is that it would rain until July Fourth ...\n\nRajarapu: It would, like, constantly rain, without any break. So the only time that they go without any precipitation is August and September, and then October it starts raining again. So it’s just the two months, which, typically, soil would hold enough moisture during that time.\n\nPierre-Louis: But now it’s extended to, like, 100 days, and the soil just can’t hold moisture for that long.\n\nRajarapu: Exactly, that’s what we are seeing. And right now I have an experiment that’s going in the field where I am trying to monitor the moisture present in the soil throughout the growing season and try different mulch covering the seedling so that I could improve that moisture retention in the soil by mulching the seedling, protecting that moisture in the soil from evaporating.\n\nPierre-Louis: And I know it’s still early, but are you seeing any sort of promising results, any suggestions of things that might help reduce the impact of those pressures on the seedlings?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, sure, so the mulching practice or experiments to improve seedling survival; it’s not something new ...\n\nSo seedling survival—that first year of establishment is very crucial. It has just become so that, with the weather patterns, it has become more challenging. So some of the things that my predecessor and other professors at Michigan State University have tried is different root dips, so these are polymers, these are inert polymers that cover the root surface and are commercial products that are available and are claimed to hold moisture and also any nutrition.\n\nSo all these trials have been done in the past, and what came out or emerged as a hero or a savior is mulch. Just typical wood mulch would help seedlings survive and also significantly reduce the temperature—that is, soil temperature—under the mulch. But one of the concerns that growers have is that the wood mulch, depending on the source where they’re getting from, might carry some diseases that might infect their soil. But we don’t have any evidence, scientifically, for that. That’s one of the concerns they have.\n\nAnd it’s also the price. Like, if wood mulch is expensive, is there something that we are getting for free? For example, this year three or four different mulch covers that I’m trying is sawdust, compost, and I’ve tried hazelnut shells. Hazelnut is another big industry in Oregon, and all the hazelnut growers are wondering what to do with their shells after they harvest the nuts. So they are trying to find ways that they could reuse or repurpose these shells, so I’m testing that, also, as a mulch in this field trial.\n\nAnd right now my results show any kind of mulch would help the seedling survive better than having no mulch. But I’m studying more deeper into this, so I’m measuring needle chemistry to see if there is any difference in nutrition from these different mulch. That’s another concern for growers, too, that these raw, uncomposted mulch might steal nutrient from the soil and, also, a seedling might not be getting enough. So that’s another concern that I’m trying to address with this research.\n\nPierre-Louis: One of the ways tree farmers are coping with increasing pressures around climate change is by planting some different species of trees. I understand they’re maybe planting some trees that came originally came from Europe?\n\nRajarapu: Yep, so we, at OSU Extension, and also North Carolina State has a very strong Christmas-tree-genetics program. So back in 2010 researchers from Oregon State University and North Carolina State University and Washington State and Michigan State got together and went to Republic of Georgia and Turkey to find different species that can hold their needles well, can make other great Christmas trees ...\n\nRajarapu: And looked for these trees. So they collected seeds from trees that have great traits or that can make great Christmas trees. They brought in those seeds, and they grew all those seeds, two seedlings in the U.S. ...\n\nRajarapu: And planted in different regions within the U.S. So we have those trials, or test plots, in Washington, Oregon, North Carolina, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania. So all the same seedlings were planted in different regions to see if certain seedlings would emerge as perfect for that geographic condition.\n\nSo we found some that perform best in Oregon and Washington, and we have established seed orchards for the seedlings, or particular genetics, for Nordmann and Turkish fir. Those are the two firs that we identified or were brought into the U.S. as seeds, and we are growing them so that they can mature and produce seeds. And yes, these seem to do better than our natives, like noble fir, particularly, which is very sensitive to temperature changes and lesser precipitation, whereas these Nordmann and Turkish fir have been more resilient, and also, they do not attract a lot of pests that [are] typically [attracted to] the native trees. And also, they have high tolerance for different types of soil. So those traits are making them popular.\n\nPierre-Louis: So for the person who loves a live Christmas tree how concerned should they be that, at some point, it might not be accessible?\n\nRajarapu: So far growers are working really hard to keep the supply going. There is definitely a decrease in the number of acres in production of Christmas trees.\n\nWe are seeing that it might be price that might be driving some people to, like, change their mind. So artificial Christmas tree, it’s convenience and also the price. It’s, like, you’re paying $400 for 10 years. I think it all comes to that.\n\nWe are trying really hard to keep the number of trees, the live trees, accessible to all consumers. We usually have more trees than we have consumers, so I don’t think so ...\n\nRajarapu: Having a shortage would be a problem, as long as consumers are willing to buy the trees.\n\nPierre-Louis: That’s really cool. It’s been lovely learning so much about Christmas trees with you. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today.\n\nPierre-Louis: That’s all for today!

    "fullText": "Managing a business is challenging, even in the best circumstances. In today's uncertain economy, marked by slowing consumer spending and shifting retail habits, it becomes even tougher.\n\nFor one retail chain, the difficulty has been compounded by years of financial strain, two Chapter 11 bankruptcies, and hundreds of store closures nationwide.\n\nOnce an iconic mall staple known for its affordable jewelry, colorful hair accessories, and quirky novelties, Claire's is again facing serious financial setbacks. A new revelation has raised doubts about the long-term survival of the 64-year-old brand, which once played a significant role in the lives of countless teens and tweens.\n\nAs it works to emerge from its second bankruptcy under new ownership by the private equity firm Ames Watson, Claire's is confronting additional pressures from its supply chain. Several Asian suppliers allege they are owed millions of dollars in unpaid debts, according to claims filed in Hong Kong and reported by CNBC.\n\nThe disputed orders were for holiday merchandise placed before Claire's second bankruptcy filing, when Elliott Management still owned the company. Suppliers were reportedly aware of the retailer's financial instability at the time the orders were made. However, by the time production was completed, Claire's had already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Ames Watson acquired the brand, some suppliers claimed they were still owed payment, but agreed to continue doing business with Claire's. Others chose to pursue legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office, RSI International.\n\nAs a major American retail chain, Claire's is a prominent customer for many of these Asian suppliers. This is why, despite outstanding balances, several vendors continued to fulfill orders out of fear that refusing to do so could jeopardize their business relationship with the retailer.\n\nDuring its latest acquisition process, RSI International notified creditors that they had 30 days to file claims to recover unpaid debts, liabilities that under Hong Kong Law do not transfer to new owners.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson emphasized it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\"\n\n\"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" said Ames Watson. \"We are excited about the company’s direction in 2026.\"\n\nClaire's first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, emerging later that year under the new ownership of Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital.",

    "fullText": "With the holidays in full swing, it’s no secret the “most wonderful time of the year” also happens to be the busiest.\n\nBetween arranging dinners and gathering with family to cooking for hours and commuting long distances, it’s easy to get lost in the daily grind and miss important information.\n\nBut when that information includes safety alerts such as product recalls, the consequences can be disruptive and even require medical intervention.\n\nWalmart, one of the nation’s leading grocery store and retail chains, has issued a number of recalls over the past month.\n\nHere’s a list of the chain’s most recent food recalls, in case you missed them:\n\nSo Delicious Dairy Free Salted Caramel Cluster Frozen Dessert Pints sold nationwide were recently recalled for containing rocks and other hard objects in the product.\n\nProducts included in the recall have expiration dates before Aug. 8, 2027.\n\nThe voluntary recall was initiated on Dec. 15 after the company found small stones and other hard objects mixed in with cashews.\n\nThe FDA says it’s been informed of the recall and that So Delicious Dairy Free is working swiftly with retail partners to remove the products from store shelves.\n\n“In the meantime, the company has already identified and corrected this issue and will soon be able to bring back the frozen dessert so many people enjoy,” the statement reads.\n\n“So Delicious Dairy Free takes every consumer experience seriously and is initiating this voluntary recall in line with its commitment to product quality and consumer safety.”\n\nCustomers who have purchased the affected product should not eat it, the FDA said.\n\nRITZ parent company Mondelēz Global issued a voluntary recall of 70 cases of RITZ peanut butter crackers sold across eight states.\n\nProducts were sold across eight states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Alabama.\n\nThe recall was initiated on Nov. 28, after the company discovered products included in the recall may be incorrectly labeled as cheese crackers, even though the product is actually peanut butter.\n\n“People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to peanuts may risk serious or life-threatening allergic reactions by consuming this product,” the recall reads.\n\nWhile the cracker cartons are correctly labeled, the individually wrapped packages may not be.\n\nBest-by dates are Jan. 8, 2026 and Jan. 15, 2026. The best-by date is labeled on top of the box.\n\n“Cartons containing only RITZ Cheese Cracker Sandwiches are not affected,” the recall notes.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has issued a recall for popular products sold at Aldi and Walmart locations nationwide after finding they may be contaminated with metal fragments.\n\nAccording to the FDA, several cheeses sold under various brands including Walmart’s Great Value brand, Aldi’s brands and Happy Farms are included in the recall, citing potential metal fragments in raw materials as the cause.\n\nThe manufacturing company, Great Lakes Cheese Co Inc., initiated a voluntary recall Oct. 3. The recall was recently updated by the FDA on Dec. 1, and classified as a Level II risk.\n\nA Level II recall is “a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.”\n\nIn total, 263,575 cases of cheese are being recalled, the bulk of which are low-moisture part-skim mozzarella shredded cheese.\n\nCans of baby formula sold across 10 states were recalled due to a life-threatening bacterial risk.\n\nByHeart Inc., a New York-based infant food company, pulled two batches of baby formula from shelves amid a federal investigation of dozens of botulism cases across the country.\n\nByHeart Inc. products included in the recall were sold in Arizona, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n\nThe company issued a voluntary recall on Nov. 8, 2025, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration informed the manufacturer of a nationwide investigation into 83 reported infant botulism cases since August.\n\nHowever, several high-profile retailers were accused of continuing to sell recalled infant formula — weeks after the product was recalled.\n\nIn a Dec. 12, notice, the FDA said despite notifying retailers such as Target, Walmart and Kroger in writing of the recall more than a month ago, affected products were still for sale at several locations.\n\n“Despite these recall notifications, subsequent visits by regulators confirmed that recalled ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula remained available for purchase on shelves in at least four Walmart stores,\" the FDA charged.\n\nLikewise, the FDA said Target continued to sell the products in at least four stores.\n\nBusiness Monday ETC: Dec. 29, 2025\n\nJudge finds protesters ‘not responsible’ for actions at Northampton defense contractor\n\n‘Smells like doughnuts all the time’: Mass. residents complain about Dunkin’ plant\n\nIconic whiskey maker halts production at flagship US distillery as sales slump\n\nAfter years of closures, Central Mass. mall is sold to new owners",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive on Wednesday warned that it would take action against any “unjustified measures” after the U.S. State Department barred five Europeans it accuses of pressuring U.S. technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nThe Europeans were characterized by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations. They include the former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton.\n\nBreton, a businessman and former French finance minister, clashed last year on social media with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with Donald Trump in the months leading up to the U.S. election.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s powerful executive branch and which supervises tech regulation in Europe, said that it “strongly condemns the U.S. decision to impose travel restrictions” and that it has requested clarification about the move. French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned it.\n\n“If needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures,” the commission said in a statement, without elaborating.\n\nRubio wrote in an X post on Tuesday that “for far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship,” he posted.\n\nThe European Commission countered that “the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.”\n\n“Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination,” it said.\n\nMacron said that the visa restrictions “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,” he posted on X.\n\nMacron said that the EU’s digital rules were adopted by “a democratic and sovereign process” involving all member countries and the European Parliament. He said that the rules “ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country.”\n\nHe underlined that “the rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe.”\n\nBreton and the group of Europeans fell afoul of a new visa policy announced in May to restrict the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for censorship of protected speech in the United States.\n\nThe four others are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index.\n\nRubio said the five had advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the United States.\n\nThe action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or penalties.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Sarah Rogers, the U.S. under secretary of state for public diplomacy, called Breton the “mastermind” behind the EU’s Digital Services Act, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. This includes flagging harmful or illegal content like hate speech.\n\nBreton responded on X by noting that all 27 EU member countries voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he wrote.\n\nAngela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris.",

    "fullText": "There is a fresh development in the case of former University of Kentucky competitive cheerleader Laken Snelling, who was accused of concealing the body of her newborn baby in a trash bag earlier this year.\n\nProsecutors requested medical records related to the case from the University of Kentucky Medical Center, according to court records obtained by The Courier-Journal.\n\nThe subpoena was delivered to the Medical Center earlier this month and returned on Monday, December 22.\n\nSnelling, 21, was arrested on August 30 and charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with physical evidence and concealing the birth of an infant.\n\nKentucky Cheerleader Laken Snelling Ordered McDonald’s Shortly After Allegedly Concealing Birth of Baby\n\nThe cheerleader allegedly gave birth to the baby and then hid its body in a trash bag in the closet of her Lexington, Kentucky, home.\n\nOne of Snelling’s roommates called the police after allegedly finding a “blood-soaked towel on the floor and a plastic bag containing evidence of childbirth” in Snelling’s room.\n\nWhen Snelling was questioned by authorities, she “admitted to giving birth” and to “concealing the birth by cleaning any evidence, placing all cleaning items used inside of a black trash bag, including the infant, who was wrapped in a towel.”\n\nA search of Snelling’s phone found internet inquiries for “different things pertaining to pregnancy, images of her during labor, photos of her doing things ordinary pregnant women should not be doing and a concealed or hidden pregnancy.”\n\nSnelling alleged she “passed out” on top of the baby after giving birth, eventually waking up to find the infant’s body “blue and purple.”\n\nThe cheerleader asked to be “checked out” by medical professionals after arriving at police headquarters in Lexington, according to an incident report.\n\nSnelling pleaded not guilty to all charges and posted a $100,000 bail on September 2.\n\nDuring a court appearance on September 26, Snelling waived her right to a preliminary trial and is currently awaiting her grand jury trial.\n\nAfter her initial plea, Snelling was confined to house arrest and split time between her parents’ homes in Tennessee.\n\nA judge issued restrictions to her house arrest in October, with Snelling ordered to wear an ankle monitor and exclusively live at her father’s home. It is not clear why the judge issued the new guidelines.\n\nActivist Says There Was a Safe Haven Baby Box 10 Minutes From Cheerleader Laken Snelling’s Home\n\nThe infant’s cause of death was ruled inconclusive and “extensive microscopic analyses are essential to determine the cause and manner of death,” according to a report from the Fayette County Coroner’s Office obtained by Us Weekly on September 4.\n\n“I understand the community’s concern and sensitivity surrounding the death of a child,” Fayette County Coroner Gary Ginn said in the report. “We are conducting a thorough and methodical death investigation to ensure all facts are carefully considered.”\n\nAt the time of her arrest, Snelling was a student at the University of Kentucky and a three-year member of the school’s STUNT cheerleading team.\n\nA spokesperson for the school told Us on September 5 that Snelling “is no longer a student at the university and, as a result, is no longer a member of the STUNT team.”",

    "fullText": "Most couples argue over real problems. He got laid off. She ran up the credit card. Someone's mom is living on the couch again. But this guy? He's spiraling over a joke.\n\nA 43-year-old husband said his 39-year-old wife—who doesn't work, doesn't cook, and doesn't clean—was casually browsing $300K job listings when she joked she might end up outearning him. Instead of flinching, he leaned into the fantasy. \"That'd be great,\" he said. \"We could finally split the bills.\" Her response? A flat-out no.\n\n\"It was hypothetical,\" he wrote in a Reddit post, \"but it still bothered me and it turned into a (mini) fight.\"\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nThe original question was innocent enough: if you ever made more than me, would you split the bills 50/50? His wife's answer wasn't even vague. \"She said she would contribute,\" he added, \"but took issue with splitting 50/50. Said she would never do that, even if she made more.\"\n\nThe situation might be hypothetical, but the resentment is real—and so is the imbalance.\n\nAccording to the husband, he currently earns over $200,000. His wife came into the marriage with $40,000 in credit card debt, which he asked her to work off before quitting her job. That job, which paid $100,000, disappeared in a round of mass layoffs. Since then, she's been unemployed, burned through severance, and started freelancing—but still wound up using credit cards to cover expenses.\n\nNow he's covering the household bills solo—and, apparently, the housework too. In updates added later, he confirmed she doesn't cook or clean. \"She says I like it OCD-level clean so it's my responsibility,\" he explained. \"We used to both cook, but she doesn't like to cook anymore, so now it's just me. Although we get takeout a lot.\"\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nNo kids. No plans for kids. No division of chores. Just one person carrying the financial and domestic load, wondering why a hypothetical question led to such a stark response.\n\nThat answer—her refusal to ever go 50/50 even if she made more—is what has him rethinking the dynamic.\n\n\"She has massive CC debt, doesn't work, doesn't clean and doesn't cook,\" one Redditor wrote. \"This isn't your wife, she's your sugar baby.\"\n\nAnother said flat-out: \"She doesn't work, she doesn't contribute financially, she doesn't contribute domestically, and maintains an entitled persona. The real question is, why are you with her?\"\n\nOthers pointed out that hypotheticals often reveal deeper truths. One commenter said, \"It showed you her thoughts and expectations… she expects you to provide for her no matter what.\"\n\nAnd while not every couple follows the same financial blueprint, tension over money is more common than many want to admit. According to new data from Intuit Credit Karma, 28% of couples say they argue about money at least once a month, a number that jumps to 39% among Millennials. For some, it goes even further — 31% have broken up or thought about breaking up over finances, rising to 50% for Millennials.\n\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nIt's not just about fights, either — it's about trust. Credit Karma also found nearly 4 in 10 admit to financial infidelity, like hiding debt or lying about spending. And 44% say they've hidden a purchase from their partner, with men more likely than women to do it, 51% vs. 38%.\n\nSome couples pool money entirely, while others split based on income ratios or expenses. The \"right\" system depends on the relationship. But when one person flatly refuses to pitch in—even hypothetically—that can trigger deeper questions. Not just about money, but about fairness, effort, and the future.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a joke,\" the husband said. But the punchline hit a little too hard.\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "description": "Most ski resorts in the area have remained closed.",
    "fullText": "Palisades Tahoe ski resort had to postpone its planned Thanksgiving week opening due to insufficient snowfall and weather conditions too warm to produce artificial snow, per SFGate.com.\n\nThe resort announced last month that it could not open as scheduled on Nov. 26 because of \"limited snowfall and short, inconsistent windows for snowmaking.\" Early-season storms delivered only light accumulation, failing to establish the snow base necessary for safe skiing.\n\n\"Even if it feels cold, high humidity can prevent snowmaking — and without sustained wet bulb temperatures, we're unable to produce the volume of snow needed for a safe and sustainable opening,\" the resort wrote, per the article.\n\nMost Tahoe-area ski resorts have remained closed, according to the Lake Tahoe Snow Report. Mount Rose Ski Tahoe and Heavenly Mountain Resort were the only two facilities operating lifts in the basin at the time of the article's publication — both after delaying their original opening dates by several weeks due to unexpectedly warm weather.\n\nVariations in the weather occur naturally, but scientific consensus has shown that human-induced warming worsens extreme weather patterns, making snow droughts both more frequent and severe. These prolonged dry spells threaten mountain communities that depend on winter tourism for their economic livelihood and survival.\n\nSki resorts worldwide have been facing mounting challenges in recent years. Italian resort communities have struggled through nearly snowless winters in recent years, while research has shown major declines in snow coverage at resorts worldwide.\n\nSome facilities have permanently closed due to unsustainable conditions, including footage from the French Alps showing bare slopes during the traditional peak season.\n\nReduced snowpack also threatens the water supply for millions who depend on mountain snowmelt. Warmer winters disrupt ecosystems and affect agricultural production.\n\nAccording to their website, snowmaking crews at Palisades Tahoe have been working as the weather allows for targeting an official opening, with only enough snow for a limited beginner experience with carpet-only access starting Dec. 6.\n\nAdditionally, some resorts are turning to new and innovative solutions — Yellowstone Club now recycles wastewater into snow for its slopes.\n\nPeople can help in their everyday lives by choosing energy-efficient appliances and shopping secondhand to reduce the impact of pollution in their communities.

Mascolo and Clary were allowed pre-trial release but were also ordered not to possess or consume alcohol or have any contact with the victim or her family, prosecutors said.\n\nRoselle police were notified of the alleged assault on June 15, which took place sometime the night before. After the assault, the victim went to a friend’s home, where she contacted her sister, who told their parents. The victim’s parents immediately picked up the victim and brought her to a local hospital for medical attention.\n\nA judge ordered arrest warrants for the three suspects on Dec. 17.\n\nMascolo was taken into custody on Sunday while he was driving near his home. Clary and Niemiec turned themselves into the DuPage County Jail on Monday.\n\n\"The allegations levied against these defendants are extremely serious,\" said DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin in a statement. \"A graduation party is a celebration of accomplishments and the excitement of a bright future. It is alleged that Mr. Clary, Mr. Mascolo and Mr. Niemiec violated the victim in the worst possible way and inflicted a lasting harm on a young woman. It is my sincerest hope that the victim and her family receive the care they require and deserve to help them cope with this horrific event. I commend the victim in this case for her courage and strength in bringing this matter to our attention.\n\nTheir next court appearances are scheduled for January.",

    "fullText": "Conflict is brewing in the Mojave Wasteland.\n\n on December 24, 2025 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead.\n\nWhile last week focused on Lucy (Ella Purnell), Cooper Howard aka The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and their pursuit of Hank (Kyle Maclachlan), this week we caught up with the newly knighted Maximus (Aaron Moten) and his chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. We also got a peek into another faction of the Mojave Wasteland, one that could potentially spell danger for our protagonists and their questline.\n\nThe episode opens up with a flashback to Shady Sands in its prime; A welcoming city that almost resembles life before The Great War. We open up on Maximus' parents in their lovely home where his father is testing the radiation levels in the water and discovers most of the water beneath the city is safe to drink and could provide a long term home for Shady Sands’ residents. Life is good until a traveling nomad muttering to himself arrives with an atomic bomb, putting the city in danger. Acting fast amongst the panic and chaos, Maximus' father attempts to disarm it but accidentally activates the bomb’s failsafe, starting the three minute timer to detonation. With little time to spare, he puts Maximus in the kitchen refrigerator and he along with his mother give a tearful goodbye before they’re killed in the blast.\n\nElsewhere, in Vault 33, we see a young Hank Maclean getting ready to read Lucy a bedtime story. His pip-boy reveals he was the one that remotely activated the bomb.\n\nIn the present day we follow Knight Maximus as he leads a squad of power-armored knights into a ghoul infested facility. After taking them out in bloody fashion, the squad recovers a piece of old world tech that’s important to their cause. Later, Elder Cleric Quintus (Michael Cristofer) informs Maximus that the piece of tech his squad recovered is a vital piece in helping their cause of reclaiming the lost world. Using the piece of tech, the Brotherhood is able to activate windmill turbines that blow away massive sand dunes, revealing the buried Area 51 facility beneath it.\n\nWhen we catch up with Lucy and Cooper’s journey, the pair are discussing how the wasteland will change Lucy more than she knows. After reiterating that she’ll never end up like Cooper, she hears a voice calling for help from an abandoned hospital. In keeping with her “golden rule” of treating others the way she wants to be treated, Lucy sets out to help despite Cooper telling her not to.\n\nInside the hospital, they find an injured man and woman that Cooper refers to as “tunics,” implying they’re from farther east. Cooper walks up to the injured man, shoots him, and then eats a piece of his skin before spitting it out in disgust. He turns over his body and realizes he’s been stung and poisoned. Before they can react, Cooper, Lucy, and the injured woman are attacked by a pack of radscoprions. While dispatching them, both Cooper and the woman are stung. With poison coursing through their veins, Lucy has to make a choice on who to use the last stimpak on. She decides to save the woman and help guide her home, but not before an angry Cooper reminds her of her “golden rule.” She promises to come back for him.\n\nMeanwhile in Vault 31, all the junior Vault-Tec executives begin to wake up after being frozen for 200 years. Amid the confusion, Norm Maclean (Moisés Arias) tells them its Reclamation Day and that Bud Askins is dead (He’s not. He’s just thrown in the trash.) He tells the executives that he’s been chosen to carry on his work and that they need to find a way out of the vault that they’re trapped in. This goes about as well as you would expect and causes the group to panic.\n\nAt the Vault-Tec facility in Vegas, Hank begins his experimentation on the miniaturization of the mind control device using mice, but is repeatedly met with failure. He gets close when a mouse begins to sit upright, but alas that one fails, too.\n\nBack at Area 51, the Brotherhood of Steel enter the facility and uncover a trove of old war relics, weapons, and cars from throughout American history—as well as an icebox. Using the cold fusion that they won in the battle of Griffith Observatory, they make Area 51 fully operational as a homebase. It’s here when Scribe Dane (Xelia Mendes-Jones) begins questioning Knight Maximus and his personality changes upon his promotion. Maximus mentions Lucy and how, now that she’s gone, he needs to focus on his duties to the Brotherhood. However, Dane assures him that Lucy could still be out there.\n\nElder Cleric Quintus sets up a meeting with fellow Brotherhood chapters from the Grand Canyon and Yosemite about banding together against the chapter from The Commonwealth. The other chapters suggest that The Commonwealth won’t give up power without igniting a civil war. Quintus reveals that following them uncovering Area 51, they now have more fusion cores than humanity has ever seen and could use them to power their conflict. The other chapters agree to unite against The Commonwealth.\n\nOn the road, Lucy is guiding the tunic woman home when she begins to act suspiciously. After giving Lucy a vague warning, she disappears. When Lucy looks around, she finds torch bearing soldiers in the hills watching her. When she gets closer to them it’s revealed that they’re all wearing Roman garb. They are Legion.\n\nIn Vault 31, Norm bands together with the junior executives and they brainstorm a way to escape the vault through the ventilation system. Using the open hatch, they all escape to the surface where Norm admires its beauty, seeing the sky for the first time in his life.\n\nHank continues his experimentation on mice when he notices a hall for Vault-Tec Premium Elite Plus customers. After thawing out one of them, he attaches a device to the back of his neck and begins asking him about why he purchased the Premium Elite Plus package for himself and what happened to his family. The man reveals it was expensive and he didn’t buy it for his family. Hank doesn’t take kindly to this and tells him “family is everything.” He then activates the device, exploding the man’s head into a bloody mess. Another failed trial.\n\nWith multiple chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel under one roof, the energy becomes chaotic with drinking, partying, and fighting. In the midst of the commotion, Maximus is challenged to hand-to-hand combat by a fellow brother for being the one to kill Moldaver. Against his desire to do so, Maximus engages in bloody combat that ends with him stabbing the brother in his stomach with his own knife. Dane exchanges looks with him disapprovingly, not recognizing the man Maximus has become.\n\nAs the fight comes to an end, a mysterious Vertibird arrives uninvited. Departing from the ship is Paladin Harkness (Kumail Nanjiani), a liaison from The Commonwealth chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. He makes an announcement that he heard rumblings of a civil war and was wondering where his invite was, signifying The Commonwealth’s knowledge of the approaching conflict.\n\nThis week’s episode was a shakeup to the status quo. Lucy and Cooper ended up separated, Maximus immersed himself in the Brotherhood’s mission, and Norm finally reached the surface with a full party of followers. This episode also showed how fractured the wasteland truly is. From the Brotherhood of Steel, the Legion, and the Great Khans, everyone wants a piece of pie and it can be assured it won’t be without violence. If it’s anything we know about Fallout it's that “war… war never changes.”\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",

    "fullText": "This week’s episode moved forward while looking back.\n\n on December 24, 2025 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead.\n\nAnother week, another episode of Fallout. This week saw lots of use of Lucy’s (Ella Purnell) “Golden Rule” and a look into the politics of the Brotherhood of Steel. In many ways this episode felt like a significant step forward for the series, but it also took its time to honor Fallout’s past. From iconic locations to lore deep cuts , there was no shortage of callbacks. Let's take a look at what “The Golden Rule” had to offer.\n\nThis week’s episode showed us a flashback of Shady Sands in its prime. While we saw the bombed city in the first season, this season gave us a look at what life was like in the New California Republic settlement before it was destroyed. Longtime fans will recognize Shady Sands as one of the first locations you can visit from the original 1997 Fallout game. Since the series is canon to the video games, its destruction is the city’s eventual fate.\n\nShady Sands meets its fate when a mind controlled stranger enters the city with an armed atom bomb. When confronted by Maximus’ father, the stranger keeps muttering a single phrase over and over: “Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.” Fans of Fallout: New Vegas will recognize this line as one used by New California Republic NPCs that didn’t have meaningful dialogue. It’s in-game use is also used to represent their mundane duties and boring patrols, which has led to the phrase being meme’d into oblivion online.\n\nMaximus (Aaron Moten) and his Brotherhood of Steel chapter gained a new base of operations this week in the form of Area 51. Though this base hides numerous old world artifacts for the Brotherhood to use , chief among them is an icebox housing an alien corpse. The alien is specifically a Zetan, whose most notable appearance is in the Fallout 3 DLC “Mothership Zeta.” Did you know that you can also encounter them in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas, too? If you have the Wild Wasteland trait selected, there’s a possibility that a spacecraft with two Zetan’s aboard will spawn. , If not, you’re left wanting to believe.\n\nWhen Norm (Moisés Arias) wakes up all of the Vault-Tec Junior Executives in Vault 31, he convinces them that it's Reclamation Day to get all of them to follow him. Reclamation Day, in Fallout lore ,is the designated day when the Vaults open up, permitting all their inhabitants to return to the surface to reestablish society. This is most notable in the game Fallout 76, where players create a resident from Vault 76, the first vault to open up after The Great War and whose inhabitants explored and settled in Appalachia.\n\nThroughout the episode, various chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel conspire to stand together against the chapter from The Commonwealth, despite it potentially causing a civil war. Fallout 4 fans will recognize The Commonwealth as the Boston-inspired setting of that entry. The Brotherhood of Steel chapter of that game was led by Elder Arthur Maxson, who was driven mad with power and sought to bring conflict and destruction to The Commonwealth by using the Brotherhood’s freedom enforcing robot, Liberty Prime.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

McCarthy (hand) already out this week:\n\nReunion: The Vikings claimed QB Brett Rypien off waivers from Indianapolis. Some added depth with J.J. McCarthy (hand) out this week. pic.twitter.com/Dz1iknCZSL\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 23, 2025\n\nBefore this past Monday’s primetime game, the Colts waived Rypien, who had previously been signed to the active roster a week prior to serve as the QB3 against Seattle, in order to create a spot for activated veteran starting defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, coming off injured reserve.\n\nIt was a little bit surprising that the Colts didn’t elect to carry Rypien and declare him inactive—as a possibility as the emergency QB3 during Monday night’s loss. It’s not that there was a strong chance he would need to be called upon by any means, but a 44-year-old Philip Rivers is presumably at least a little less durable than the average NFL starter, and especially fresh off his couch and with five years of retirement.\n\nNot to mention, rookie Riley Leonard is just a few weeks removed from a knee injury, who has been serving as the Colts’ QB2 since Rivers’ surprising arrival.\n\nAt any rate, Rypien’s stint with the Colts ends without him appearing in an NFL game. The 29-year-old veteran quarterback was signed to the Indianapolis practice squad in mid-October before his signing and release.\n\nHe now reunites with the Vikings, his old squad that he spent last season with and this entire past offseason. However, he has yet to appear in an NFL game Minnesota either. In his 5-year career, he has appeared in 11 games, making 4 starts though.\n\nFor the Colts, Rypien was presumably a candidate to return to their practice squad—should he clear waivers. However, it appears as though he’ll be taking at least a brief pit stop in Minnesota until McCarthy returns.",

He is highly rated for his pace, strength and directness.\n\nCity are in the Premier League title race with Arsenal, and signing the 25-year-old would boost their chances of success this season.\n\nThey are currently just two points behind the Gunners in the league table after a run of five consecutive wins.",

Commercial airline pilot Dennis Dutton, his son Jack and Craig Wadsworth also died in the crash.\n\nThe late NASCAR champion’s friend, Ron Herbert, shared on Sunday, Dec. 21, that he found the family’s holiday card in his mailbox.\n\n“I received this in the mail today. My words can't say enough about the family🙏🙏 🥲🥲,” Herbert’s Instagram post read.\n\nThe holiday card featured the family of four smiling, looking lovingly at one another as they embraced. \"We hope that you are able to slow down and enjoy the magic and joy that this season has to offer. We hope you have a great New Year! Sending love, Greg, Cristina, Emma & Ryder,\" the card read.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn the days before the fatal plane crash, Greg was promoting his “Biffmas” daily holiday giveaway of cash and other prizes. Cristina was also working to send out Santa’s letters to children, her mother, Cathy Grossu, told PEOPLE.\n\nCathy also shared that just before the family’s crash, Cristina texted her mother from the plane and wrote, \"We're in trouble.\"\n\n\"That was it,\" Cathy tearfully said. \"So we're devastated. We're brokenhearted.\"\n\n“I cannot believe they're gone,” Cathy said. “I don't remember those last words and that's going to haunt me. But they were happy.\"\n\nAt the time of the accident, the family was heading out for a \"birthday trip\" in Sarasota, Fla., to visit Greg's friend Cleetus McFarland (real name Garrett Mitchell).\n\nThe two became friends after connecting during the Hurricane Helene relief efforts. Eventually, they became inseparable, spending time together each month over the last year, and as McFarland’s profile grew in racing circles, Greg served as his mentor.\n\nThe rookie stock car driver shared his memories of Greg in an emotional tribute on Sunday, Dec. 21.\n\n“The last year and a half with him has been some of the greatest moments of my life. I am lucky to have had him as a mentor, and a close friend,” McFarland wrote in the video’s caption. “We love you guys so much and it's an absolute tragedy we had to lose the Biffles like this.\"",

It was supposed to be an easy game, but the Nets showed fire.\n\nEmbiid admitted after the game that he was good to return, so his injury is not a long-term issue.

    "title": "Marcus Rashford settles in at Barcelona while his future takes shape",
    "description": "The English forward is enjoying a strong spell in Barcelona on and off the pitch",
    "fullText": "Marcus Rashford’s first months in Barcelona have been about more than goals and assists. Since arriving on loan last summer, the England international has embraced both the sporting challenge and the social side of life at the club, quickly becoming involved in community projects through the Barça Foundation while also carving out an important role under Hansi Flick.\n\nRashford has long been committed to charitable work, something he credits to his upbringing in Manchester. In a recent interview, he explained that he first got involved in social initiatives as a teenager, inspired by his mother’s habit of helping the homeless, especially around Christmas. What began locally later expanded across the UK through partnerships with organizations working with vulnerable communities. He has also focused on school meal programs, drawing on his own childhood experience, and on projects that promote reading among young people, an area he discovered relatively late himself but now considers essential.\n\nThat background made his recent visits to schools and community centers in Barcelona feel natural rather than symbolic, according the forward. He said that encouraging teammates to get involved matters to him, although he believes genuine motivation has to come from within. For him, helping others is simply normal, something he has seen his whole life.\n\nOn the pitch, the adaptation has been equally smooth. Rashford says he felt welcomed from the moment he arrived and is comfortable both in the dressing room and in the city. His focus, he insists, is not individual security but collective success. “Of course I want to stay at Barça,” he said, adding, “but the reason I work hard is to win titles with Barça.” He has also been clear that the pressure at the club is a positive force, describing it as the kind of demand he has always wanted as a player.\n\nThose words match his impact so far. Used by Flick on the left wing and through the middle, Rashford has become a regular option in the attacking rotation. He has contributed seven goals and eleven assists across all competitions, numbers that have helped restore his standing at club level and reopen the door to the England national team ahead of next summer’s FIFA World Cup under Thomas Tuchel.\n\nInternally, Flick’s growing influence is shaping how Barça view Rashford’s situation. According to reports, the club’s confidence in the German coach has strengthened to the point that an extension beyond his current deal is being prepared, an unusual move given Barça’s traditional caution. That stability has benefited players like Rashford, whose role is clearly defined within the system.\n\nBarcelona hold an option to buy the forward for around 28 to 30 million euros, depending on the source, and the likelihood of triggering it has increased in recent weeks according to Mundo Deportivo. Still, patience remains the official stance. Sporting director Deco has said it is “not the moment to take any decision about Rashford’s future,” while stressing that the club is happy with his contribution.\n\nSeveral factors will weigh into the final call. The club reportedly wants to see continued improvement in Rashford’s work without the ball, particularly his pressing and defensive intensity, even if there have been signs of progress. Financial considerations are just as important. Rashford would need to accept a significant salary reduction compared to what he earned at Manchester United in order for a permanent deal to fit Barça’s economic limits.\n\nMeanwhile, his resurgence has not gone unnoticed elsewhere. Reports in France and England suggest that Paris Saint-Germain are monitoring his situation and could be prepared to offer substantially more than Barça’s option fee if he returns to the market, although questions remain about how well he would fit Luis Enrique’s demands off the ball.",

    "title": "On This Day (24 Dec 1921): Tricky Hawes Is Worth Every Penny!",
    "description": "Tricky quickly found his feet on a treacherous surface and started repaying the fee Sunderland had paid near-neighbours South Shields for his services with two goals and a rampant performance on his debut.",
    "fullText": "This would prove to be Sunderland’s biggest win of the season as Sunderland battered their Black Country rivals with goals and performances all over the pitch.\n\nThe Sunday Sun reported in its Christmas Day edition that Sunderland’s left-hand side (Harry Martin and debutant Hawes) gave a sparkling display, with Mitton shining by virtue of his “wonderful dash and opportunism” as he helped himself to a hat-trick.\n\nJack Mitton had been converted from a centre-half into a centre-forward by manager Bob Kyle, and by the end of this game would be on six goals in the last four games.\n\nMany fans had been floored by the predicted long-term absence of popular inside-forward Bobby Marshall. The purchase of Arthur “Tricky” Hawes from Second Division (and near-neighbours) South Shields for a good sum of £1,750 had come as something of a surprise. Whilst Hawes had been top scorer in the 1920/21 season with seventeen goals, he had only netted once in fourteen appearances for the Mariners in this season.\n\nSome of the doubters coming into this match may have felt differently by the end of the game. Tricky delivered as good a debut as many fans had seen in a long time. His passing, in particular with his left-wing partner Harry Martin, was superb, and his footwork on the ball a joy to behold.\n\nHawes scored on twenty-three minutes as he mastered the treacherous pitch to deliver some slick dribbling and a blistering shot just inside the box to open the scoring for Sunderland.\n\nThat there was no more scoring before half-time and West Brom were somehow still in the game had more to do with over-elaboration and difficulty managing the rock-hard icy conditions on the home team’s part than anything the visitors were doing.\n\nThe second half was a different story. Sunderland to a man managed the conditions much better, and as the left-hand side of the attack in particular got going, the Baggies had no answer. Hawes gave his marker Sammy Richardson a torrid afternoon as Martin and Mitton followed suit.\n\nAfter a good passage of passing Mitton scored on forty-seven minutes and then again ten minutes later. Hawes got his second goal and Sunderland’s fourth to cap a brilliant display. Mitton completed the scoring on seventy-two minutes to leave West Brom easily second-best on the day and him with a hat-trick.\n\nSunderland were good value for their win and might have scored more.\n\nThe Lads moved up to third in the table after this victory, but their title challenge would falter by the end of the season and they would finish twelfth with West Brom finishing just below them in the table.\n\nTricky Hawes went on to play twenty-three games and scored five goals in the 1921/22 season. His partnership with Harry Martin continued to flourish, though England international Martin did miss eleven games in the run-in to this season.\n\nThe following season Tricky scored twelve goals and was a regular in a forward line that featured Charlie Buchan (30 goals) and Jock Paterson (21 goals) as the Lads finished second behind Liverpool.\n\nThe following two seasons Hawes continued to play regularly as Sunderland finished third in 1923/24 and seventh in 1924/25. He contributed eleven goals in each of these seasons and was something of a fan favourite by this point in his career with the Lads.\n\nIn the 1925/26 season Sunderland bought Bob Kelly from Burnley and Dave Halliday from Dundee (this season would also herald the start of Bobby Gurney’s career). Tricky found game-time hard to come by and only appeared six times in each of the next two seasons (1925/26 and 1926/27), scoring no goals. Sunderland finished third in each of these seasons as they made a reasonable stab at winning the title again.\n\nWith limited game time Arthur Hawes decided to move on after 147 appearances and 39 goals between December 1921 and May 1927.\n\nBradford Park Avenue paid £650 for his services and he played 52 games over two seasons scoring 17 goals. From July 1929 he spent a season each with Accrington Stanley, Nelson, and Rochdale before finishing his playing career aged thirty-eight, having played 321 games and scored 86 goals.\n\nThroughout his playing career Tricky carried a white handkerchief in his left hand every time he played. It was an odd quirk, the reasons for which have been lost in the passage of time.\n\nThere is no doubt that Tricky gave particularly good service to Sunderland in his time with the club – an unselfish goal-scorer and creator who was a real fan favourite at Roker Park.\n\nGoal-scorers – Hawes 23 & 60 mins; Mitton 47, 57, & 72 mins.\n\nSunderland – Jimmy Dempster; Bert Hobson; Bob Young; Charles Parker; Joe Kasher; John Poole; Jimmy Stephenson; Charlie Buchan; Jack Mitton; Arthur Hawes; Harry Martin.\n\nWest Brom – Hubert Pearson; Joe Smith; Jess Pennington; Sammy Richardson; Sid Bowser; Bobby McNeal; Tommy McGee; Jonathan Blagdon; Steve Davies; Fred Morris; Howard Gregory.",

    "description": "The Grizzlies beat the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night, hanging on to the 9th spot in the Western Conference.",
    "fullText": "The Memphis Grizzlies beat the Utah Jazz, 137-128, on Tuesday night to improve to 14-16 on the season. That gave them a teeny, tiny boost in the fight for play-in positioning in the Western Conference.\n\nI guess that’s some sort of an accomplishment.\n\nFrankly, it was hard to watch this game and decide what was worse — the tanking Jazz team whose defense helped to make Santi Aldama look like a world beater (the Wizards also did this the other night, so that’s the kind of company the Jazz are in), or the Grizzlies team that was so recently considered to be on their way to perennial title contention, barely fighting for the ninth seed.\n\nIt’s not wild to imagine that if the Jazz were fielding a roster meant to win, playing only their best players on a regular basis and if Walker Kessler wasn’t recovering from shoulder surgery, they could probably give a team like the Grizzlies a run for their money for a play-in spot (is that something to be proud of?). They might even be better than this version of the Grizzlies.\n\nBut the Jazz aren’t serious about getting wins, and they’re still playing the Grizzlies pretty close (and the Jazz beat the Grizzlies in Memphis on Dec. 12).\n\nRemember when this Grizzlies team was one of the bright-future, must-watch teams of the NBA? It really wasn’t that long ago. They were the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference for two straight seasons in 2021-22 and 2022-23. That’s like yesterday in NBA years.\n\nThey were widely regarded as one of the NBA’s most fun teams to watch and then it all came crashing down. Watching the Memphis Grizzlies is a reminder of the fragility of the NBA and how the margins for error are so thin.\n\nKyle Anderson, now a Jazz man, was one of the really important supporting cast members on that Memphis team. And he, like so many others wonders where things went wrong.\n\n“Yeah, I’m with you, kind of wondering what’s going on over there,” Anderson told the Deseret News. “My opinion of it is that front office walked into something really good, and put together a really good team at first. We were rolling. Then they kind of wanted to go in their own direction and bring in young guys that kind of fit more what they wanted to do. I think that’s where they got mixed up and lost in the sauce.”\n\nAnd then so many other things happened. Most notably, Ja Morant’s off-court shenanigans. The point, though, is that every decision from every person on an NBA team has to come together in the perfect way to even get close to being able to compete for a title.\n\nIt takes so many things to go right for a team to be great. There needs to be talent, buy-in, good coaching, tenacity, freedom from distractions. And any small crack in the foundation can have catastrophic consequences. Because on NBA teams, one small crack often spreads and splinters and leads to more and more dysfunction.\n\nAnd the Grizzlies have gone through just about all of it — front office decisions changing the chemistry of the team, tensions between players and coaches, off-court behavior impacting availability of stars (time and time again), fractures in relationships, deals that have split up a once-hungry and competitive nucleus, injuries, coaching turnover, etc., etc.\n\nThere’s probably a number of teams that don’t think they are susceptible to these things happening to them, but it takes just one disgruntled star, one player being around the wrong people, one person getting bad advice, one person making a bad decision.\n\nI guess when considering all of these things, it’s the Grizzlies who were the most disappointing to watch on Tuesday night — thinking of what could have been. Instead, there was Morant, in street clothes, yet again injured, watching his team from the sideline, knowing that even if they make it to the play-in tournament, that would mean being destined for the Oklahoma City Thunder swiftly sweeping them in the first round.\n\nTonight they beat the Jazz. But that’s not much to be proud of.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool opted to do several loan deals last summer.\n\nIt wasn’t just promising youngsters moving on temporary spells away however - even though the likes of James McConnell and Lewis Koumas were among those to depart.\n\nIn the case of Harvey Elliott and Kostas Tsimikas it was decided to move them on in the eventual hope of selling them in summer 2026.\n\nElliott secured a loan at Aston Villa - with an obligation to buy should he feature in 10 Premier League matches. Right now it’s more likely that he returns to Liverpool however with Villa seemingly resistant to paying £35m for the 22-year-old.\n\nAnd Tsimikas is having a tough time of it too - with the 29-year-old not in the plans of Roma head coach Gian Piero Gasperini. The Greek moved to the Italian capital with high hopes of impressing and perhaps securing a permanent move at the end of the season.\n\nThere is no permanent clause attached to the deal however and the left-back will only have a year on his Liverpool deal when he comes back next summer.\n\nBut according to Italian transfer reporter Nico Schira he could be coming back to base even sooner than that.\n\n“Evan Ferguson, Leon Bailey and Kostas Tsimikas are not in Gian Piero Gasperini’s Plans and they could already leave ASRoma in January’s transfer window.” a report reads on X.\n\nThis of course will have major repercussions for Liverpool. The club failed to secure a purchase clause in the original loan deal - and not many suitors are going to be willing to pay top dollar for a 30-year-old reserve left-back with only 12 months on his contract.\n\nThe Premier League champions may end up taking a sizeable hit on Tsimikas next summer - even if he manages to get fixed up with another loan deal in January.\n\nThere is no chance of him playing for Liverpool this season - with Milos Kerkez and Andy Robertson both ahead of him in the queue at left-back.\n\nBut his Roma days look numbered with Gasperini preferring to use right-backs or right-sided wing-backs on the left rather than calling up Tsimikas.",

    "description": "A new savings vehicle, dubbed “Trump accounts,” is designed to help the rising generation of American children build wealth into adulthood. Under the multitrillion-dollar tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in July, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to accounts set up for every American baby born in the next few years. Darrick Hamilton, Henry Cohen Professor of Economics and Urban Policy at the New School, is behind a comparable concept known as \"baby bonds,\" which he sees as a means to granting more social mobility and agency to young people regardless of family income levels. Professor Hamilton compares and contrasts his idea with the Trump administration's mechanism with Alexis Christoforous and Isabelle Lee on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily.",

    "description": "The Nemotron 3 family of open models — in Nano, Super and Ultra sizes — introduces the most efficient family of open models with leading accuracy for building agentic AI applications.",
    "fullText": "NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA Nemotron™ 3 family of open models, data and libraries designed to power transparent, efficient and specialized agentic AI development across industries.\n\nThe Nemotron 3 models — with Nano, Super and Ultra sizes — introduce a breakthrough hybrid latent mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture that helps developers build and deploy reliable multi-agent systems at scale.\n\nAs organizations shift from single-model chatbots to collaborative multi-agent AI systems, developers face mounting challenges, including communication overhead, context drift and high inference costs. In addition, developers require transparency to trust the models that will automate their complex workflows. Nemotron 3 directly addresses these challenges, delivering the performance and openness customers need to build specialized, agentic AI.\n\n“Open innovation is the foundation of AI progress,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With Nemotron, we’re transforming advanced AI into an open platform that gives developers the transparency and efficiency they need to build agentic systems at scale.”\n\nNVIDIA Nemotron supports NVIDIA’s broader sovereign AI efforts, with organizations from Europe to South Korea adopting open, transparent and efficient models that allow them to build AI systems aligned to their own data, regulations and values.\n\nEarly adopters, including Accenture, Cadence, CrowdStrike, Cursor, Deloitte, EY, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Palantir, Perplexity, ServiceNow, Siemens, Synopsys and Zoom, are integrating models from the Nemotron family to power AI workflows across manufacturing, cybersecurity, software development, media, communications and other industries.\n\n“NVIDIA and ServiceNow have been shaping the future of AI for years, and the best is yet to come,” Bill McDermott, chairman and CEO of ServiceNow. “Today, we’re taking a major step forward in empowering leaders across all industries to fast-track their agentic AI strategy. ServiceNow’s intelligent workflow automation combined with NVIDIA Nemotron 3 will continue to define the standard with unmatched efficiency, speed and accuracy.”\n\nAs multi-agent AI systems expand, developers are increasingly relying on proprietary models for state-of-the-art reasoning while using more efficient and customizable open models to drive down costs. Routing tasks between frontier-level models and Nemotron in a single workflow gives agents the most intelligence while optimizing tokenomics.\n\n\"Perplexity is built on the idea that human curiosity will be amplified by accurate AI built into exceptional tools, like AI assistants,\" said Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity. “With our agent router, we can direct workloads to the best fine-tuned open models, like Nemotron 3 Ultra, or leverage leading proprietary models when tasks benefit from their unique capabilities — ensuring our AI assistants operate with exceptional speed, efficiency and scale.”\n\nThe open Nemotron 3 models enable startups to build and iterate faster on AI agents and accelerate innovation from prototype to enterprise deployment. General Catalyst, Mayfield and Sierra Ventures’ portfolio companies are exploring Nemotron 3 to build AI teammates that support human-AI collaboration.\n\n“NVIDIA’s open model stack and the NVIDIA Inception program give early-stage companies the models, tools and a cost-effective infrastructure to experiment, differentiate and scale fast,” said Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield. “Nemotron 3 gives founders a running start on building agentic AI applications and AI teammates, and helps them tap into NVIDIA’s massive installed base.”\n\nNemotron 3 Reinvents Multi-Agent AI With Efficiency and Accuracy \n\nThe Nemotron 3 family of MoE models includes three sizes:\n\nAvailable today, Nemotron 3 Nano is the most compute-cost-efficient model, optimized for tasks such as software debugging, content summarization, AI assistant workflows and information retrieval at low inference costs. The model uses a unique hybrid MoE architecture to deliver gains in efficiency and scalability.\n\nThis design achieves up to 4x higher token throughput compared with Nemotron 2 Nano and reduces reasoning-token generation by up to 60%, significantly lowering inference costs. With a 1-million-token context window, Nemotron 3 Nano remembers more, making it more accurate and better capable of connecting information over long, multistep tasks.\n\nArtificial Analysis, an independent organization that benchmarks AI, ranked the model as the most open and efficient among models of the same size, with leading accuracy.\n\nNemotron 3 Super excels at applications that require many collaborating agents to achieve complex tasks with low latency. Nemotron 3 Ultra serves as an advanced reasoning engine for AI workflows that demand deep research and strategic planning.\n\nNemotron 3 Super and Ultra use NVIDIA’s ultraefficient 4-bit NVFP4 training format on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, significantly cutting memory requirements and speeding up training. This efficiency allows larger models to be trained on existing infrastructure without compromising accuracy relative to higher-precision formats.\n\nWith the Nemotron 3 family of models, developers can choose the open model that is right-sized for their specific workloads, scaling from dozens to hundreds of agents while benefiting from faster, more accurate long-horizon reasoning for complex workflows.\n\nNew Open Tools and Data for AI Agent Customization\n\nNVIDIA also released a collection of training datasets and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning libraries available to anyone building specialized AI agents.\n\nThree trillion tokens of new Nemotron pretraining, post-training and reinforcement learning datasets supply the rich reasoning, coding and multistep workflow examples needed to create highly capable, domain-specialized agents. The Nemotron Agentic Safety Dataset provides real-world telemetry to help teams evaluate and strengthen the safety of complex agent systems.\n\nTo accelerate development, NVIDIA released the NeMo Gym and NeMo RL open-source libraries, which provide the training environments and post-training foundation for Nemotron models, along with NeMo Evaluator to validate model safety and performance. All tools and datasets are now available on GitHub and Hugging Face.\n\nNemotron 3 is supported by LM Studio, llama.cpp, SGLang and vLLM. In addition, Prime Intellect and Unsloth are integrating NeMo Gym’s ready-to-use training environments directly into their workflows, giving teams faster, easier access to powerful reinforcement learning training.\n\nGet Started With NVIDIA Open Models\n\nNemotron 3 Nano is available today on Hugging Face and through inference service providers including Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks, FriendliAI, OpenRouter and Together AI.\n\nNemotron is offered on enterprise AI and data infrastructure platforms, including Couchbase, DataRobot, H2O.ai, JFrog, Lambda and UiPath. For customers on public clouds, Nemotron 3 Nano will be available on AWS via Amazon Bedrock (serverless) as well as supported on Google Cloud, CoreWeave, Crusoe, Microsoft Foundry, Nebius, Nscale and Yotta soon.\n\nNemotron 3 Nano is available as an NVIDIA NIM™ microservice for secure, scalable deployment anywhere on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure for maximum privacy and control.\n\nNemotron 3 Super and Ultra are expected to be available in the first half of 2026.",

According to the redacted portion of the civil suit, revealed through copying and pasting into another document, one of the executors, Darren K. Indyke, signed a check from Mr. Epstein’s foundation to an immigration lawyer who was “involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims.”\n\nIt is unclear how the files were redacted in a way that could allow for withheld names and entities to be identified. The Guardian reported earlier on some of the documents’ redactions being undone.\n\nA spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nPresident Trump last month signed into law a bill promising the release of all files related to the Epstein investigation, as well as transparency around their release. The bill said that no documents could be redacted on the basis of “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.” It granted exceptions for redactions in a number of situations, including where victims’ personal information could be compromised.\n\n“The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law — full stop,” Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said in a statement last week.",

    "description": "Stories shape how your child thinks, feels, and understands the world.",
    "fullText": "Stories shape how your child thinks, feels, and understands the world. They connect language, emotion, memory, and meaning in a way few activities can. When storytelling becomes part of daily life, these connections strengthen and quietly influence learning, curiosity, and behavior.\n\nAt a cognitive level, stories train the brain to understand structure. A beginning leads to a middle. Actions lead to outcomes. This mirrors how children learn cause and effect. Research influenced by thinkers like Jean Piaget shows that children grasp ideas more deeply when they are embedded in meaningful narratives rather than abstract instruction.\n\nLanguage development accelerates inside stories. Words arrive with context, emotion, and repetition, which makes them easier to retain and reuse. When stories are read or heard regularly, children pick up sentence patterns, tone, and rhythm. Over time, this shows up as clearer expression and stronger listening skills.\n\nImagination plays a central role in emotional development. When your child steps into the world of a character, they practice seeing life from another point of view. This builds empathy and emotional awareness. Stories allow children to explore fear, joy, and frustration in a safe space, without real-world consequences.\n\nCreative storytelling also supports decision-making. Characters face problems, make choices, fail, and try again. Children absorb these patterns naturally. They learn that effort matters and that actions have outcomes. These lessons shape patience, self-control, and thoughtful behavior in everyday situations.\n\nStorytelling works best when it invites participation. Reading together or listening to a story and then talking about it turns passive consumption into active thinking. Simple moments help:\n\nDigital storytelling can support this process when it is designed with care. Calm visuals, clear language, and room for imagination matter more than constant interaction. This is where platforms like StoryBee fit naturally into a child’s routine.\n\nStoryBee allows parents and educators to create personalized stories based on a child’s age, interests, and learning needs. A story can be read, illustrated, or listened to as audio, which supports different learning styles. StoryBee focuses on creativity and imagination rather than overstimulation, helping children stay engaged without losing the reflective nature of storytelling.\n\nFor busy parents, StoryBee also lowers the barrier to consistency. Instead of searching for the right book every day, StoryBee helps generate fresh stories that still encourage thinking, curiosity, and conversation. The experience stays flexible and child-led.\n\nYou do not need long sessions to see impact. One short story a day, whether from a physical book or through StoryBee, is enough. What matters is presence and repetition. Stories are not about teaching facts. They shape how your child understands themselves and the world around them.\n\nYou do not need long sessions.\nConsistency matters more than duration.\n\nYou are not teaching content.\nYou are shaping how your child thinks.\n\nStories are quiet builders. When you choose thoughtful storytelling experiences and tools like StoryBee, you give your child skills that last well beyond childhood.",

    "fullText": "Blogging goes mainstream in 2003; and with the launch of Google AdSense, pro blogs emerge too. Also the iTunes store debuts, social networks ramp up, and Flash websites are everywhere.\n\nFlash at full volume: Jamiroquai’s website in 2003.\n\nBlogging and RSS moved into the mainstream in 2003, helped by the emergence of consumer-friendly RSS Readers like NetNewsWire and Bloglines. There was even now an economic model for blogging, with the launch of Google's AdSense in March. Also, online music went legit with Apple's iTunes store, and social networking began to take recognizable form with Friendster and MySpace.\n\n\"Social software\" was a geeky term being used in the blogosphere during this time. So there was an understanding that social aspects would underpin the next web era, even if the tech industry hadn't yet put all the pieces together.\n\nClay Shirky explaining \"social software\" in Esther Dyson's Release 1.0 newsletter; May 2003.\n\nIf there was one company that was putting together the jigsaw puzzle that would later be named Web 2.0, it was Google. In February, Google acquired the leading blogging service of the day: Blogger.\n\n“Google, which runs the Web's premier search site, has purchased Pyra Labs, a San Francisco company that created some of the earliest technology for writing weblogs, the increasingly popular personal and opinion journals,” wrote Silicon Valley reporter Dan Gillmor on February 15, 2003.\n\nNeedless to say, Google's purchase brought blogging even more into the mainstream. Other blogging tools, such as Movable Type, Radio Userland and LiveJournal, gained popularity over 2003 too.\n\nMeanwhile, there was also a revolution happening in reading software. RSS Readers (sometimes called \"news aggregators\") were increasingly being used. Two examples were FeedDemon and NetNewsWire — these were desktop readers, for Windows and Mac respectively. Then in mid-2003, a browser-based RSS Reader called Bloglines launched; by August I was a Bloglines user and have used browser-based readers ever since.\n\nPeople used these new reader apps to RSS became a crucial part of the blogging movement over 2003, because it enabled bloggers to be discovered and their content to be distributed across the internet.\n\nIn addition to buying Blogger, Google was starting to figure out its business model. The company had only recently begun to turn a profit, thanks to its AdWords online advertising platform — introduced in 2000. But when the company launched a contextual advertising system in March, we began to see why blogging was of such interest to Google.\n\nInitially given the descriptive, if clunky, name \"Content-Targeted Advertising,\" Google's new ad product was promoted as \"a new, automated system that matches advertising precisely to the information on content and community pages.\"\n\nGoogle's Content-Targeted Advertising system, 2003.\n\nAdSense opened the door to professional blogging. Nick Denton, previously cofounder of the news syndication company Moreover, was one of the first to take advantage. He'd launched Gawker in January 2003 and by November was telling the New York Times that AdSense was effectively guiding his topic selection:\n\n\"The way Mr. Denton determines the theme of his blogs has less to do with his own personal interests than with the demands of the market, as determined by Google. He relies on Google's AdSense program, which pays Web sites to publish text ads matched to the pages' content, for the bulk of his revenue. As a result, he picks blog subjects based on the rate Google pays for clicks on ads in specific topic areas. Among the topics of blogs he plans to start this year are computer gaming, travel and politics.\"\n\nGawker, a pioneering pro blog, in July 2003.\n\nFriendster launched publicly in March 2003. It wasn’t the first social networking site on the internet: Classmates.com had started in 1995, Six-Degrees.com the following year, and LiveJournal began in 1999 as a kind of blogging spin on the idea. But Friendster was the first of this kind of site to gain major traction in Silicon Valley. It was initially pitched as “a new way to meet people” for dating purposes, “or making new friends.”\n\nDespite its popularity — it had around three million registered users by the fall of 2003 — Friendster was slow and plagued by technical issues. That left the door open for other social networks to enter the market and offer a better product.\n\nMySpace did exactly that, when it launched in August 2003 as “an online community that lets you meet your friends' friends.”\n\nMySpace in September 2003, the month after its launch.\n\nMySpace grew quickly. By October, it had over one hundred thousand users. It was still small fry compared to Friendster, but MySpace users seemed to be having more fun than Friendster users. Partly this was because MySpace allowed people to edit the HTML in their profiles — which meant they could add colourful backgrounds and fonts, and use images and GIFs like on Geocities. This helped MySpace attract a youthful user base, which in turn helped it become the trendy new social network.\n\n2003 was really Friendster's year, but the immediate future would belong to MySpace...although it, too, would leave the door open for competitors. In late-2003, a little website called \"Facemash\" came online — it was created by a Harvard University student named Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn April 2003, Steve Jobs launched the iTunes Music Store at a special Apple music event. It offered over 200,000 songs, which you could buy for 99 cents each. Notably, the file format wasn't MP3, but a new format called AAC (Advanced Audio Encoding) encoded at 128 kilobits per second. The file quality was generally viewed favorably, although Sound on Sound commented in a November review:\n\n\"While AAC definitely offers better-quality encoding than MP3 at the same bit rate, Jobs' claim that AAC \"rivals CD quality\" was maybe a little bit of a liberty.\"\n\nThe iTunes store was initially available to Mac computers only; and also restricted to the US for licencing reasons. In October, the store was expanded to Microsoft Windows when iTunes for Windows was launched. But international expansion didn't begin happening until mid-2004 (my country, New Zealand, had to wait until 2005).\n\niTunes Music Store webpage, 29 April 2003.\n\nThe idea with the iTunes Store was that you downloaded the music and owned the file (albeit with DRM — Digital Rights Management). In time, online music would gravitate to the streaming model, which in 2003 was the domain of Rhapsody. But Apple's big advantage was the success of the iPod, which meant it had a complete hardware-software ecosystem. Also, you could listen to your music offline — a key feature in 2003, when internet connectivity was still largely restricted to PCs and laptops.\n\nIn mid-December 2003, Apple announced that more than 25 million songs had been sold from the iTunes store since its April launch. It had also doubled the song catalog to more than 400,000 songs.\n\niTunes user interface; via Sound on Sound, November 2003.\n\nAs game designer and net artist Nathalie Lawhead wrote in a later retrospective, Flash “started as a tool for bringing animations to the web,” but it “eventually grew to being used for building rich, immersive, and very animated websites.” 2003 was smack in the prime years of what Lawhead termed the “Flash website movement (when websites were ‘the new emerging artform’).”\n\nBowieNet version 3 was made entirely of Flash; screenshot circa September 2003.\n\nA showcase for Flash websites during this time was the Favourite Web Awards (FWA), run by Rob Ford. In his review of 2003, Ford highlighted tokyoplastic v1, an experimental Flash site designed by Sam Lanyon Jones and Drew Cope from the UK. \"One of those rare sites that gave you an adrenaline rush (or was that a fright?) when you clicked on the loaded graphic and the site swallowed you up,\" Ford wrote.\n\nJones and Cope later said that the site \"served no purpose just kooky animation, sound design and a bit of interaction.\" While that's underselling their clever use of vector graphics and 3D animation in tokyoplastic v1, it does sum up what Flash brought to the web: a sense of creativity and fun, albeit sometimes it \"served no purpose.\"\n\nSo by the end of 2003, the web felt primed for a new era: social software was going mainstream, web standards were stable while Flash brought the pizzazz, and business models were emerging. Could this be the second generation of the internet coming online?\n\nMore year-by-year overviews of internet history:\n\nMy Web 2.0 memoir, Bubble Blog: From Outsider to Insider in Silicon Valley's Web 2.0 Revolution, is now available to purchase:\n\nOr search for \"Bubble Blog MacManus\" on your local online bookstore.",

    "fullText": "As he planned for his death, Jeffrey Epstein listed powerful friends and associates from Wall Street as the people who would take care of his affairs.\n\nVersions of Epstein's will released Tuesday by the Justice Department featured former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former Barclays CEO Jes Staley, and former Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne as potential executors of his estate.\n\nThe final version of Epstein's will — which was signed in August of 2019, while he was in jail awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges in Manhattan, and shortly before he killed himself — listed his longtime personal lawyer, Darren Indyke, and accountant Richard Kahn as his estate executors.\n\nThe older versions of Epstein's will were released following the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the Justice Department to make its Epstein-related files public. In addition to Epstein's 2019 indictment, his associate Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2021 for trafficking girls to him, and in 2008, he pleaded guilty to a crime involving sexual misconduct with a minor.\n\nThe files include references to many of Epstein's powerful associates, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Inclusion in the documents isn't an indication of wrongdoing.\n\nCayne, who died in 2021, was listed as a co-executor for Epstein's estate in versions of Epstein's will signed in 2003 and 2004. Epstein worked at Bear Stearns in the 1980s, before becoming a financial advisor to billionaires Les Wexner and Leon Black.\n\nCayne's daughter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn 2012, Epstein listed Staley — who was then an executive at JPMorgan Chase — as a backup executor to his will. In 2013, Staley was promoted to co-executor status, alongside Indyke.\n\nStaley kept the position as co-executor of Epstein's will in the 2014 version as well. By then, Epstein had listed Summers as a backup executor.\n\nAn attorney for Staley didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Staley said in a 2019 letter to a UK regulator that he did not have a close relationship with Epstein.\n\nStaley stepped down as the CEO of Barclays in 2021 following an investigation into his ties with Epstein from the British bank regulator, which banned him from working in the financial industry. A UK court earlier this year upheld Staley's ban, finding that he lied about having a \"purely professional\" relationship with Epstein.\n\nSummers stepped down from his teaching post at Harvard and from his board seat at OpenAI following the release of numerous emails between him and Epstein by the House Oversight Committee last month.\n\nSteven Goldberg, a spokesperson for Summers, said in a statement that the economist was not involved in Epstein's financial life.\n\n\"Mr. Summers had absolutely no knowledge that he was included in an early version of Epstein's will and had no involvement in his financial matters or the administration of his estate,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nEpstein also included another prominent figure in the penultimate version of his will. A draft of the will, released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this year, listed top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler as the backup estate executor.\n\nRuemmler, through JPMorgan, declined to comment when the will was released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge upheld the Trump administration's ability to place a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications.\n\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, DC, said in the opinion that President Donald Trump's order made on September 19 to hike visa fees \"rests on a straightforward reading of congressional statutes giving the President broad authority to regulate entry into the United States for immigrants and nonimmigrants alike.\"\n\n\"Here, Congress has decided to delegate broad power to the President to restrict entry of noncitizens '[w]henever the President finds that\" such entry 'would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,'\" wrote Howell.\n\n\"To be clear, this decision in favor of defendants is not to dismiss or discount the past and ongoing contributions of H-1B workers to the American economy that plaintiffs highlight,\" Howell added. \"The effects of the H-1B program on the American economy or national security, whether positive or negative, are simply not at issue in this case.\"\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and Association of American Universities, which challenged the policy in court, can appeal the decision.\n\nIn the initial court filing asking for an immediate injunction on the visa fee hike, the plaintiffs argued that presidential powers do not sweep so far as to permit the president to \"rewrite a visa program by imposing an unprecedented fee on domestic employers, and purporting to deny entry only when those domestic employers are unable or unwilling to pay.\"\n\nTrump's presidential proclamation in September, said to prevent system \"abuses\" and to encourage companies to train American workers, sent major tech companies scrambling as they raced to decipher the new rules.\n\nThe Trump administration later clarified that the fee hike only applies to new visas.\n\nH-1B visas have become a mainstay of the tech industry, enabling companies to hire highly skilled workers.",

    "fullText": "Gold is finishing 2025 at all-time highs, and the momentum is set to extend into 2026.\n\nThe spot gold price surged past $4,500 per troy ounce for the first time on Wednesday in Asia trading and is trading around $4,490 per ounce. The yellow metal is up more than 70% so far in its best year since 1979.\n\nGold could stay strong because the rally drivers are structural, not purely reactive, according to analysts.\n\n\"Gold doesn't need a crisis to rise in 2026. It simply needs the world to behave the way it has been: elevated debt, policy uncertainty, fragile alliances, and a dollar that no longer dominates as it once did,\" wrote Farah Mourad, a market analyst at IG, a trading platform.\n\n\"In that environment, gold doesn't chase fear — it absorbs it,\" Mourad added.\n\nIG did not provide a price forecast but noted that major banks expect gold to trade in the $4,500 to $4,700 per ounce range next year, with potential upside toward $5,000 if macro conditions persist.\n\nMonetary policy could provide additional support. With inflation proving sticky and growth uneven, markets increasingly expect interest rates to drift lower over time.\n\nThat matters for gold, which tends to perform best when real yields fall, and the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets declines.\n\nThere are, of course, risks. A stronger-than-expected rebound in the US dollar or a sustained shift back toward risk-on sentiment could slow gold's advance.\n\nBut investor positioning in gold remains relatively balanced compared with previous peaks, suggesting the trade is not yet overcrowded, Mourad wrote.\n\nThat perspective aligns with forecasts from major banks.\n\n\"We see gold prices hitting more record highs in 2026,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, earlier this month.\n\nFactors that could extend gold's bull run include President Donald Trump's likely choice of a next Fed chair inclined to push for lower interest rates, she wrote.\n\nShe added that gold is likely to find support on pullbacks.\n\n\"We expect the downside to be limited as any weakness will likely attract renewed interest from both retail and institutional buyers,\" Manthey added.\n\nWall Street giant Goldman Sachs predicts that gold prices will climb to $4,900 per ounce by December 2026.\n\nGold's surge this year has contributed to gains in other precious metals as well.\n\nSpot silver prices have also hit record highs this year and are trading about 147% higher year-to-date at around $72 per ounce.\n\nMeanwhile, spot platinum has also hit an all-time high and is up about 159% this year, trading around $2,342 per ounce.",

The Russian defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe SBU said that disabling the aircraft was a key prior step for the later, main strike on the Russian submarine.\n\nThe Sea Dragon, which is designed to detect underwater threats, had been \"actively countering the operations of the SBU's maritime drones,\" the security service said.\n\n\"In the Black Sea, the Russians had only one aircraft of this class capable of detecting the 'Sub Sea Baby' underwater drone as it moved toward its target,\" the SBU added.\n\nThe SBU said the attack unfolded at the Yeysk air base.\n\nYeysk sits on the eastern flank of the Sea of Azov across from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol, and is roughly 140 miles from the port of Novorossiysk.\n\nRussia stations many of its naval assets at this Black Sea port, which is also where the SBU said earlier this month that it attacked a Russian Kilo-class submarine with a Sub Sea Baby.\n\nThe drone is a version of the Sea Baby uncrewed surface vessel — which is equipped with an explosive warhead and designed to ram into its target — that is modified to run underwater.\n\nThe SBU released footage of an explosion near a pier in the port of Novorossiysk, though it's unclear when this video was filmed.\n\nRussia's Black Sea Fleet has denied that the attack caused significant damage to the Kilo-class sub.\n\nThe diesel-electric boat, estimated by Ukraine to be worth $400 million, is designed to carry up to four Kalibr cruise missiles. This precision missile type is often compared to the US Tomahawk and has been used regularly by Russia to attack Ukrainian cities.\n\nUkraine has no official navy of its own, but it has used drones and missiles to harass Russia's Black Sea Fleet and, at times, drive it away.\n\nThe SBU had earlier said that the attacked Kilo-class submarine was in Novorossiysk after retreating from Crimea due to Ukrainian attacks.",

    "description": "Cassi Zheng spent her 30th birthday alone in Tokyo. It gave her a chance to stop focusing on what was missing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cassi Zheng, 31, the founder of Aurawell, an aromatherapy brand. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a brand director at a sports-drink startup in Shanghai, I spoke to more than 30 people a day — from members of the sports community to suppliers and colleagues seeking sign-offs.\n\nI was drained. I felt chronic pain, constant fatigue, and even had panic attacks.\n\nIn February 2023, at 29, I quit. I wanted to head into my 30s with a clearer sense of purpose. I didn't tell my parents, but my friends and colleagues were supportive.\n\nSuddenly, I had nothing to do, and that early idleness felt panic-inducing. I was so used to running around, talking to people, and being needed. I felt completely lost for a few days.\n\nThen I started trying different things. I biked across the city from one end to the other, covering more than 10 kilometers. Another time, I biked 30 kilometers just to go kayaking.\n\nI felt exhausted, but also energized.\n\nI spent the first year traveling across Asia. Because I'd been practicing Reiki, Japan felt like a natural first stop.\n\nOn a trip to Tokyo and Kyoto with friends, temples and traditional inns sparked something within me. I knew I wanted to go back again on my own.\n\nI kept moving. Bangkok's flea markets and Chinatown reminded me of Guangzhou, where I grew up, in the '90s.\n\nIn South Korea, I rang in the new year on Jeju Island with old friends, racing to find a taxi minutes before midnight.\n\nOn New Year's Day, I flew to Kyoto for my first true solo trip. I'd lived on my own before — college and grad school in the US, travel through Mexico, Kenya, Nepal — but Japan felt different. It was the perfect place to be an introvert.\n\nI spent my birthday alone in Tokyo, sick with the flu, wandering the Nezu Museum's gardens. The quiet design reminded me to notice what's present, instead of what's missing.\n\nI returned to Japan twice more that year, spending days meditating alone in the mountains.\n\nA year and a half after quitting, I spent three weeks in Europe. On a hike in Sicily, I met a man climbing beside me. He spoke Italian, I spoke English, but we managed. He told me his father had paved the mountain road. Afterward, I visited his café.\n\nSicily felt open and passionate — a contrast to Shanghai's intensity.\n\nI began crying without knowing why and felt ashamed. I tried to step away, but the teacher told me I didn't need to hide. With an East Asian upbringing, that was incredibly freeing. I cried for two days, overwhelmed by release.\n\nI'd long relied on external validation from bosses, parents, and goal-driven metrics. My gap year loosened that grip. I could count the trips or the solo days, but none of that defines me.\n\nOn my 30th birthday, I finally told my parents about my gap year and the aromatherapy brand I was starting with a friend. They were shocked — it was far outside their comfort zone — but showing them my business plan and prototypes helped. Even now, when I visit them a few hours outside Shanghai, they enjoy talking about metrics and the future of my company.\n\nMy friend and I launched Aurawell in May 2024, just over a year after I left my job. I first got the word out by leading a public meditation in an underground performance space.\n\nTaking a gap year was one of the wisest decisions I've made. It gave me time to slow down, reflect on my choices, and discover what I actually enjoy, without pressure from the outside world.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "fullText": "Kate Winslet turned 50 this year and says her definition of success has changed.\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek in an interview released on Tuesday, the \"Titanic\" actor spoke about aging and what it's been like to reach this milestone in her life.\n\n\"I think that women get more interesting as we grow older. I think that we're more involved in life. We have so much more experience,\" Winslet told Newsweek.\n\nShe added that turning 50 \"feels fantastic\" and that she's looking forward to what the coming years will bring.\n\n\"When we grow up, and we think about what we want to be when we're older, I never imagined any of this,\" Winslet said.\n\nAs a result, she said she has come to view success in a very different way.\n\n\"Success, actually, for me more these days is more about pulling it off, being a decent person. You know, being able to take care of people, having time for friends, also learning how to be OK with not being busy all the time,\" she said.\n\nWinslet said there's value in learning to slow down.\n\n\"I think it's important to remind ourselves that sometimes being OK just in stillness and in our own company,\" she said.\n\nShe said she doesn't know how to meditate, but it's something she should learn.\n\nWinslet isn't the only Hollywood star who has reflected on how turning 50 has changed her perspective.\n\nDuring a \"Today\" show appearance in November 2024, Lauren Sánchez Bezos said she didn't think she would have so much to look forward to in life after turning 50.\n\n\"When I was 20, I thought, 'Oh my gosh, life is over at 50.' Let me tell you: It is not, ladies. It is not over,\" she said.\n\nIn January, Chelsea Handler told Parade that she was feeling \"pretty into myself\" as she turned 50.\n\n\"My life is exactly what I hoped it would be — it's more than I hoped it would be. I had no idea what the possibilities were or that I could live a life like this and feel so free,\" Handler said.",

    "fullText": "Waymo has laid out what went wrong when its robotaxis stalled in San Francisco during a power outage on Saturday.\n\nThe Alphabet-owned self-driving car company said in a statement on Tuesday that its autonomous vehicles behaved as designed when intersections went dark, treating them as four-way stops. The problem was scale.\n\nThe Waymo \"may occasionally request a confirmation check\" when it encounters dark traffic signals to \"ensure it makes the safest choice,\" the statement said.\n\n\"While we successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday, the outage created a concentrated spike in these requests.\"\n\n\"This created a backlog that, in some cases, led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets,\" the company added.\n\nOn Saturday, some Waymo robotaxis stalled in intersections and along busy streets in San Francisco during a power outage, according to footage shared on social media. One clip on X showed at least five driverless vehicles bunched together at a junction, causing traffic congestion.\n\nThe power outage, which affected about 130,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers, prompted Waymo to halt its ride-hailing services.\n\nWaymo told Business Insider on Sunday that it had restarted its robotaxi service in the area.\n\nOn Monday, the California Public Utilities Commission told Business Insider it is \"looking into specifics\" of the incident.\n\nWaymo said on Tuesday it had established the confirmation checks during early deployment \"out of an abundance of caution,\" and the company is \"now refining them to match our current scale.\"\n\n\"While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the driver with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively,\" Waymo added.\n\nThe company also said on Tuesday that it had suspended its service in San Francisco because city officials asked for clear streets for first responders.\n\n\"This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort,\" Waymo added.\n\nIn addition to the updates that would provide vehicles with more context about power outages, Waymo said it would improve its emergency response protocols and expand engagement with first responders.\n\nWaymo launched its driverless ride-hailing service in Phoenix in 2018 and now operates in other cities, including Austin and Atlanta, through a partnership with Uber.\n\nIn 2022, it rolled out driverless vehicles in San Francisco and made rides available to the public via its app last year.\n\nWaymo's expansion has not been entirely smooth-sailing. In May, Waymo recalled the software affecting more than 1,200 vehicles after some crashed into chains or gates. A bodega cat in San Francisco was run over by a Waymo car, prompting outcry from residents, Business Insider reported last month.",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMarket commentator and popular media personality Jim Cramer may be advocating for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) these days, but not long ago, he completely wrote off cryptocurrency as an investment.\n\nThe stunning collapse of the FTX exchange during the fall of 2022 triggered a “Crypto Winter,” dragging Bitcoin to a low of $16,000. The exchange’s bankruptcy and subsequent arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried rocked the market, just a year after it had celebrated new highs.\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nIn this backdrop, Cramer appeared on CNBC on Dec. 23, stating that the faith of the American people has been shaken.\n\n“I sold all my crypto. I announced everything on TV, what I did with crypto,” the “Mad Money” host said. “I wouldn’t touch crypto in a million years.”\n\nCramer also took a dig at those who put their coins on unregulated trading platforms.\n\n“If you have your money in any of those, look, I’m not calling you an idiot. I’m just saying you’re using a lot of blind faith,” he said.\n\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses—This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\n\nBitcoin traded at $16,796 when Cramer made these remarks.\n\nFast forward three years, and the apex cryptocurrency is worth $86,805 apiece, marking a whopping return of 416%. So, if you adopted the \"Inverse Cramer\" strategy, you’d be laughing all the way to the bank today.\n\nNote that there has been no definitive proof of this being a profitable strategy. So DYOR.\n\nPrice (Recorded on Dec. 23, 2022)\n\nPrice (Recorded at 11:45 p.m. ET)\n\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nIt's worth pointing out that while Bitcoin has thrived in a broader three-year timeframe, its fortunes have declined more recently.\n\nThe apex cryptocurrency has wiped out all of its 2025 gains in the ongoing slump, and currently trades 31% below its all-time highs.\n\nMeanwhile, Cramer sounds more like a Bitcoin fan today. Last week, he said that he just wants Bitcoin, not any derivative or Bitcoin treasury companies.\n\nEarlier in the year, he advocated for Bitcoin as a hedge against the escalating U.S. national debt, stating that he was buying a lot himself.",

    "fullText": "It’s been quite a year for Apple (AAPL). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia (NVDA) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\n\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\n\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google (GOOGL, GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta (META) Reality Labs' new design studio.\n\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times, Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\n\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\n\nCook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\n\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.",

    "fullText": "As 2025 winds down, several restaurant chains are completing restructuring and turnaround strategies to strengthen their operations and generate increased revenue and profits.\n\nJack in the Box is among the burger chains seeking to cut costs by closing restaurant locations. The fast-food chain launched its Jack on Track turnaround program in April 2025, which called for the company to close 150-200 underperforming restaurants, with up to 120 closed by Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nThe remaining underperforming restaurants would close as franchise agreements terminate.\n\nBurger chain franchisor CKE Restaurants Holdings, which franchises Hardee's and Carl's Jr restaurants, has been in a battle with some of its franchisees as it tries to collect revenue, such as franchise fees, digital fees, advertising fees, and rent.\n\nCKE Restaurants operates over 3,800 Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurants across 44 states and 43 countries.\n\nCKE affiliate Hardee's Restaurants LLC sued franchisee ARC Burger LLC, which owned 80 Hardee's locations, for alleged breach of contract, seeking to recover over $6.5 million in unpaid franchise fees and other obligations, according to Law.com.\n\nThe franchisee allegedly defaulted on various payments, including royalties, advertising fees, and rent, beginning in December 2024.\n\nARC Burger, facing expensive litigation and millions of dollars of debt to Hardee's, closed about 28 of the dining chain's restaurants by Dec. 20,  KXEO Radio Inc. of Mexico, Mo., reported. ARC has not filed for bankruptcy protection, which would trigger an automatic stay of litigation, however.\n\nWendy's, which operates about 6,000 locations in the U.S. and about 7,330 worldwide, said during its third quarter 2025 earnings call that it would close \"around a mid-single-digit percentage of U.S. restaurants,\" which is estimated to be about 300 restaurants.\n\nThe burger chain planned to close \"consistently underperforming restaurants,\" Wendy's CEO Ken Cook said in the earnings call.\n\nAnd now, Wendy's has closed a location that no longer makes sense to operate, as the huge burger chain permanently shut a Stockton, Calif., restaurant whose lease was expiring.\n\nThe Wendy's franchisee that owned the 10512 Trinity Parkway location in early December shuttered the restaurant, removed signage, and boarded up the building, the Stockton Record reported. The building is located next to a Starbucks and an El Pollo Loco.",

    "description": "China is already producing a wide range of EVs, including several options that cost less than $25,000.",
    "fullText": "In 2025, 1 in 4 new automotive vehicle sales globally are expected to be an electric vehicle – either fully electric or a plug-in hybrid.\n\nThat is a significant rise from just five years ago, when EV sales amounted to fewer than 1 in 20 new car sales, according to the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organization examining energy use around the world.\n\nIn the U.S., however, EV sales have lagged, only reaching 1 in 10 in 2024. By contrast, in China, the world’s largest car market, more than half of all new vehicle sales are electric.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has reported that two-thirds of fully electric cars in China are now cheaper to buy than their gasoline equivalents. With operating and maintenance costs already cheaper than gasoline models, EVs are attractive purchases.\n\nMost EVs purchased in China are made there as well, by a range of different companies. NIO, Xpeng, Xiaomi, Zeekr, Geely, Chery, Great Wall Motor, Leapmotor and especially BYD are household names in China. As someone who has followed and published on the topic of EVs for over 15 years, I expect they will soon become as widely known in the rest of the world.\n\nChina’s automakers are producing a full range of electric vehicles, from the subcompact, like the BYD Seagull, to full-size SUVs, like the Xpeng G9, and luxury cars, like the Zeekr 009.\n\nRecent European crash-test evaluations have given top safety ratings to Chinese EVs, and many of them cost less than similar models made by other companies in other countries.\n\nThere are several factors behind Chinese companies’ success in producing and selling EVs. To be sure, relatively low labor costs are part of the explanation. So are generous government subsidies, as EVs were one of several advanced technologies selected by the Chinese government to propel the nation’s global technological profile.\n\nBut Chinese EV makers are also making other advances. They make significant use of industrial robotics, even to the point of building so-called “dark factories” that can operate with minimal human intervention. For passengers, they have reimagined vehicles’ interiors, with large touchscreens for information and entertainment, and even added a refrigerator, bed or karaoke system.\n\nCompetition among Chinese EV makers is fierce, which drives additional innovation. BYD is the largest seller of EVs, both domestically and globally. Yet the company says it employs over 100,000 scientists and engineers seeking continual improvement.",

    "fullText": "Two people are dead after an apparent gas explosion collapsed part of a nursing home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWATCH: Pennsylvania officials provide update on explosion at Bucks County nursing home.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro confirmed two deaths at a news conference Tuesday evening.\n\nPolice initially said a third person had died but later clarified that one of the original victims was resuscitated at a local hospital.\n\nOne female employee was later recovered deceased during the final search, which was thought to have raised the death toll to three.\n\nPolice report that all employees and residents have now been accounted for. The search has concluded, and an investigation is underway.\n\nAction News has also learned that 20 people were sent to various hospitals. Their conditions are unknown.\n\nIt happened around 2:15 p.m. at the Bristol Health and Rehab Center, also known as Silver Lake Nursing Home, on the 900 block of Tower Road in Bristol Township.\n\nPECO confirms crews responded around 2 p.m. after getting reports of a gas odor.\n\nThe explosion occurred while crews were on the scene. PECO said it's not known at this time if their equipment, or natural gas, was involved in the incident.\n\nVideo from the Action Cam showed flames erupting from the building. Debris could be seen scattered around the area.\n\nAn explosion and fire have been reported at a nursing home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThis facility is operated by the Saber Healthcare Group, based in Ohio.\n\nIn a Facebook post Tuesday night, they said \"We are working closely with local authorities, and our primary focus remains on the well-being of residents, staff, and their families.\"\n\nOne woman who works at the facility said she has been trying to contact co-workers, but no one is answering their phones. That woman also told Action News that she flagged a gas smell over the weekend.\n\nA man who showed up at the scene said his wife works at the nursing home and he hasn't yet heard from her.\n\nRescuers were called in from neighboring Montgomery County, the city of Philadelphia and New Jersey.\n\n\"I saw smoke and I saw car after car after car was a fire truck or ambulance from all over the city, from all over,\" State Rep. Tina Davis, whose district includes the center, told the Associated Press. She approached the scene in her car but did not want to interfere with response efforts.\n\nThe American Red Cross of Southeastern Pennsylvania says anyone who needs help locating a family member that has been affected is asked to go to Lower Bucks Hospital, 501 Bath Road, Bristol, or call 215-785-9200.\n\n\"It's just so sad - it's that hopeful time of year. This is just something that is sad for everybody and the families and the workers that are there. I hope there's positive results from this. We don't know at this point,\" Davis said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Air traffic controllers lost communication for about 10 minutes with a small Mexican Navy plane carrying a young medical patient and seven others before it crashed off the Texas coast in thick fog, killing at least six people, Mexico's government said Tuesday.\n\nThe plane was working with a nonprofit group transporting Mexican children with severe burns to a hospital in Galveston, near Houston, when the plane crashed Monday afternoon. Authorities believed the plane had landed, but the flight had lost contact with air controllers, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday in her morning briefing.\n\nTeams found the dead bodies of five people and pulled two survivors from the plane's wreckage, then set off on a daylong search in the waters near Galveston for 29-year-old Navy Lieutenant Luis Enrique Castillo. Castillo's family back in their rural town in southern Mexico were left scrambling for answers, hoping for the best for their missing son.\n\n“We don't know what to do,\" his father Eduardo Castillo said Tuesday. “All we can do is wait. We can’t go to the United States, we have no visa.\"\n\nThe search came to an end Tuesday night when search teams found Castillo's body. American authorities are investigating the the cause, but the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that it could take a week or more to recover the aircraft.\n\n“What happened is very tragic,” Sheinbaum said in her morning press briefing, noting that sailors were among the dead.\n\nPlane was too low as it descended\n\nAs the twin turboprop Beech King Air 350i approached Sholes International Airport in Galveston, radar shows it was far too low, said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration crash investigator.\n\nA navigation system for the runway where the plane was supposed to land had been out of service for about a week, Guzzetti said. The system sends signals to the airplane cockpit that helps pilots navigate in the kind of bad weather that had enveloped the area. The fog was so thick that meteorologists estimated only about a half-mile of visibility.\n\nThe pilot should have aborted the landing if the runway wasn't visible at an altitude of 205 feet (62.5 meters), climbing back up before trying again or looking for another airport entirely, Guzzetti said.\n\nGuzzetti said the reported radar track shows that the pilot was descending rapidly below 200 feet (61 meters), a full 2 miles (3 kilometers) away from the runway.\n\n“Maybe there was some sort of mechanical malfunction,\" he said. “But just looking at the recorded flight track and comparing it with the weather and the airport equipment outage, seems to me that this landing approach should never have occurred.”\n\nThe plane crashed in a bay near the base of the causeway connecting Galveston Island to the mainland. The popular beach destination is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Houston.\n\nSky Decker, a professional yacht captain who lives near the crash site, said he jumped in his boat to see if he could help. He picked up two police officers who guided him through the thick fog to the nearly submerged plane. Decker jumped into the water and found a badly injured woman trapped beneath chairs and other debris.\n\n“She had maybe 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of air gap to breathe in,\" he said. \"And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.”\n\nHe said he also pulled out a man seated in front of her who had already died.\n\nEduardo Castillo gathered with the rest of his family and friends Tuesday afternoon in their small community of El Pantano in the sweltering southern Mexican state of Veracruz.\n\nThe father, who worked long hours as a carpenter to give his son the opportunities he never had, was desperately refreshing his phone every few minutes, looking for any news of their missing son. Mexico's Marines, he noted, had provided few other details than a call saying their son was missing.\n\nFramed pictures of Luis Enrique Castillo and his many diplomas coated a wall of their home. He and his wife were expecting a baby due in three months.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Castillo heard his phone ring and answered, hearing the words he had dreaded. His son was dead.\n\n“Now he's never going to meet his unborn child,” Eduard Castillo said as his family hugged and sobbed around him.\n\nInvestigators dig into the cause\n\nA spokesperson for the NTSB said in an email that investigators will review maintenance records, weather forecasts and air traffic control communications. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days.\n\nGuzzetti said the investigation also will likely look into how serious the young patient's medical condition was and how motivated the pilot was to land.\n\n“There have been previous accidents in the air medical community where pilots try to push their luck in order to save the patient,” he said.\n\nThe aircraft had a “very, very proven design,” said aviation safety expert John Cox. He said it’s the latest version of a series that has been in use since the 1960s and would have been outfitted with all the modern electronics, avionics and equipment.\n\nPlane was helping with medical mission\n\nMexico's Navy said the plane was helping with a medical mission in coordination with the Michou and Mau Foundation.\n\nThe charity was founded after a mother died trying to save her kids from a fire. One child died, while another survived after receiving treatment at Shriners Children's Texas in Galveston. Over 23 years, the foundation has helped transfer more than 2,000 patients to that hospital and other medical facilities with burn expertise, according to the charity's website.\n\nIn a social media post, the foundation offered condolences to the families of the crash victims.\n\nShriners Children’s Texas said in a statement that it learned of the crash with “profound sadness” but wasn't able to provide any information about the child's condition.\n\nCrash comes amid focus on aviation safety\n\nThis latest crash comes amid a year of intense scrutiny on aviation safety after a string of high-profile crashes and the flight disruptions during the government shutdown driven by the shortage of air traffic controllers.\n\nThe January midair collision between an Army helicopter and an airliner near Washington, D.C., was followed by the crash of a medical transport plane in Philadelphia. This fall’s fiery UPS plane crash only added to the concerns. Still, the total number of crashes in 2025 was actually down a bit from last year, and experts say flying remains safe overall.\n\nMarquez reported from El Pantano and Janetsky reported from Mexico City.

Jeff Landry said the Trump administration isn't going to “go in there trying to conquer anybody\" or try to \"to take over anybody’s country.”\n\nThe governor's comments seemed somewhat at odds with Trump, who has repeatedly said the U.S. needs to take over the Arctic territory for the sake of U.S. security and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.\n\n“Well, I think our discussions should be with the actual people in Greenland — the Greenlanders,” Landry said in an appearance on Fox News' “The Will Cain Show.” “What are they looking for? What opportunities have they not gotten? Why haven’t they gotten the protection that they actually deserve?”\n\nTrump's announcement of Landry's appointment has once again stirred anxiety in Denmark and Europe.\n\nDenmark’s foreign minister told Danish broadcasters that he would summon the U.S. ambassador to his ministry.\n\n”We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a joint statement Monday. “They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security.”\n\nTrump called repeatedly for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland during his presidential transition and in the early months of his second term. In March, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base in Greenland and accused Denmark of under-investing there.\n\nThe issue gradually drifted out of the headlines, but in August, Danish officials summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.\n\nThe Trump administration did not offer any warning ahead of the announcement of Landry's appointment, according to a Danish government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe administration also has yet to provide any details about the appointment to Congress, according to a congressional aide who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump is renewing the Greenland debate at a moment when he has no shortage of foreign policy crises to dealing with, including maintaining a fragile truce in Gaza and negotiating an end to Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutal war in Ukraine.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday questioned the wisdom of “picking fights with friends” at such a difficult moment around the globe.\n\n“Greenland’s sovereignty is not up for debate,” Shaheen said. \"Denmark is a critical NATO ally that has stood side by side with the U.S.”",

    "description": "Think of the current system like a massive library.",
    "fullText": "New research exposes the staggering scale of the global wildlife trade entering the U.S., painting a disturbing picture of a system operating in the dark.\n\nA study published in Current Biology mapped two decades of data and found that the volume of wildlife being shipped across borders is far greater — and less regulated — than previously thought.\n\nHere is the reality. When we think of \"wildlife trade,\" we usually picture black-market smugglers. But the legal trade is actually 10 times larger, worth an estimated $360 billion annually. According to the study, we are shipping nature off wholesale, often with zero oversight on whether these species can survive the harvest.\n\n\"With no way to say what animals are in trade and if this trade is sustainable, we are potentially driving many species towards extinction in plain sight,\" said professor Alice Hughes, who led the study.\n\nThink of the current system like a massive library where people are checking out books, but no one is keeping track of the inventory. Eventually, the shelves are going to be empty.\n\nThis isn't just about losing exotic animals in faraway lands. It is a direct threat to the stability of our own environment.\n\nRemoving species from their habitats is like pulling threads out of a sweater. You might not notice the damage at first, but eventually, the whole thing unravels.\n\nAnd if you think that's bad, this trade also acts as a superhighway for invasive species and diseases. Importing animals often means importing their pests and pathogens, which can jump to native wildlife and decimate populations that have no natural defenses. For example, the international trade of Xenopus frogs likely spread a deadly fungal disease that has already contributed to the extinction of multiple species.\n\nThese smuggling rings are also often connected to organized crime networks involved in activities such as human trafficking and drugs.\n\nIt's not looking so good. But the good news is that technology is finally catching up to help tackle the problem. Researchers are now using AI to identify wildlife trafficking hubs at airports, spotting patterns that human investigators might miss.\n\nShould companies be required to help recycle their own products?\n\nThey should get tax breaks instead\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIn South Africa, scientists are taking a more radical approach by injecting nontoxic radioactive isotopes into rhino horns. It acts like a dye pack in a bank robbery, making the horns detectable by scanners and useless for human consumption.\n\nBut this battle has to be fought on many fronts, which is why lawmakers are also closing loopholes. Pennsylvania recently passed a bill banning the sale of parts from endangered species such as mammoths and leopards, shutting down local demand.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "We could all learn a thing or two from Connor Ingram.",
    "fullText": "We could all learn a thing or two from Connor Ingram.\n\nThe 28-year-old goalie made 26 saves Sunday in his first NHL start since February, helping the Edmonton Oilers beat Vegas 4-3. It had been ten months since his last NHL game. Ten months since he entered the NHL/NHLPA Player Assistance Program (PAP) in March to cope with the death of his mother to breast cancer.\n\nThat was Ingram's second time entering the PAP.\n\n\"I've been through enough to know the sun's coming up tomorrow, no matter what happens in this life,\" Ingram said after the game. \"I've got a wife and a family that loves me. That's all that really matters at the end of the day. You want to win hockey games, but there's a lot more to life than hockey.\"\n\nThere's more to life than hockey. I know, crazy thought.\n\nBut Ingram knows this simple fact better than most. He first entered the Player Assistance Program in January 2021 to deal with undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder. He came back. He played. He won the Bill Masterton Trophy in 2023-24 for perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey after posting 23 wins and a .907 save percentage with Arizona.\n\nThen his mother died. And he entered the program again in March, this time to cope with grief that hockey couldn't fix.\n\nOilers vs Flames: Pre-game Stats 18-13-6 | 42 PTS\n\n\"There were a lot of days where I didn't think it (returning to the NHL again) would ever happen again,\" Ingram admitted. \"I mean, it's just the truth of it. In this world, it's a competitive game with 64 spots to do this. So you don't take it for granted any day, it's a huge honour.\"\n\nSixty-four goaltending spots in the NHL. That's it. And Ingram spent ten months away from one of them, dealing with personal challenges that had nothing to do with save percentages or wins and losses.\n\nUtah placed him on waivers in September. He went unclaimed. The Oilers acquired him on October 1 for future considerations, and Utah retained $800,000 of his $1.95 million salary. Edmonton sent him to Bakersfield, where he went 4-5-2 with a 4.04 GAA and .856 save percentage in 11 games.\n\nOilers Looked Decent Enough In Ingrams First Game Back And the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/edmonton-oilers\">Edmonton Oilers</a> lineup reads as follows:\n\nThose numbers aren't good. But Ingram was cleared from the Player Assistance Program on August 20th. He missed training camp. He was finding his game while dealing with everything that came before it. The statistics don't tell that story.\n\n\"If you surround yourself in life with good people, when you need them, they're there,\" Ingram said. \"And I think when you go through struggles, you find out people that really are around, and those are the people you want to keep around.\"\n\nSunday against Vegas, those people got rewarded. Ingram made his first save 37 seconds into the game—a tricky blocker stop against Ivan Barbashev that drew a loud cheer from fans. He was too locked in to notice. Seven saves in the first period. Nine in the second. Ten in the third when Vegas scored twice to make it 4-3.\n\nA Look Into Andrew Mangiapane's Slow But Steady Development With The Oilers Andrew Mangiapane hasn't been scoring goals. That much is obvious. His last one came November 3 against Nashville, and when he finally ended the drought Saturday afternoon in Minnesota—tipping an Evan Bouchard shot past Filip Gustavsson at 13:35 of the first period—it had been 21 games and 47 days since he'd seen one cross the line.\n\nHe looked comfortable. He looked like someone who's played 103 career NHL games and knows what he's doing. He looked like a goalie who's been through enough to know that making saves matters, but it's not everything.\n\n\"It's what you dream of your whole life,\" Ingram said. \"You don't dream of playing in the American League. You want to play in the NHL. So like I said before, you don't take any day for granted, and every day you're here's a good day.\"\n\nEvery day you're here's a good day. That's the perspective of someone who's had days where getting out of bed was the accomplishment. Days where hockey didn't matter because life was overwhelming. Days where the sun coming up tomorrow wasn't guaranteed to feel like a good thing.\n\nRetired Goaltender Coming to Oilers?: Maybe We Should Pump the Brakes a Little The Oilers' chaotic goaltending situation means rumors are inevitable. Does that mean talk of a retired netminder coming to Edmonton is a real thing?\n\nIngram is back now. Tristan Jarry is on injured reserve with a lower-body injury and will miss a couple weeks. Calvin Pickard is Edmonton's other goalie. Ingram will get more starts, more chances to prove the Oilers made the right call acquiring him in October.\n\nBut even if he doesn't, even if the numbers don't work out, even if this opportunity ends up being temporary, Connor Ingram has already won something more valuable than hockey games.\n\nHe's back doing what he loves, with the people he loves, after dealing with challenges that had nothing to do with the game itself. He's playing in the NHL again after ten months away. He's making saves and getting cheers and living the dream he's had his whole life.\n\nSpencer Stastney Is Quietly Becoming A Very Interesting Piece For The Oilers A hidden gem acquired from Nashville, Spencer Stastney's calm puck-moving and defensive reliability are proving invaluable to the Oilers' blue line depth.\n\n\"I've been through enough to know the sun's coming up tomorrow,\" Ingram said.\n\nWe could all learn from that. There's more to life than hockey. There's more to hockey than hockey. And sometimes, just being here is enough.\n\nConnor Ingram is here. And every day he's here is a good day.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "description": "Broncos dominate Pro Bowl selections with six named players and six alternates, highlighting Denver's elite status and dominant season performance.",
    "fullText": "The 12-3 Denver Broncos have stampeded their way into the league’s elite in 2025, sharing the NFL’s best record with the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. With this dominance, it’s no surprise that the Broncos will have six players representing the Mile High City at the Pro Bowl this year.\n\nEdge Nik Bonitto, guard Quinn Meinerz, tackle Garett Bolles, and cornerback Pat Surtain II have been named starters for this year’s Pro Bowl in San Francisco. They’ll be joined by edge Zach Allen and receiver Courtland Sutton on the bench.\n\nThere could be even more Broncos representation than the previously mentioned six, however. Quarterback Bo Nix, safety Talanoa Hufanga, linebacker Alex Singleton, fullback Adam Prentice, special teamer Devon Key, and returner Marvin Mims were all named as Pro Bowl alternates. If players decline their Pro Bowl invitation due to playing in the Super Bowl, injury, or another reason, alternates will fill in for them.\n\nDenver is already tied for the most Pro Bowl players this season with their six, tied with the San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks, and Baltimore Ravens. If an alternate is chosen, the Broncos would be leading the league in Pro Bowlers.\n\nIt’s deserving for each of the confirmed and alternate selections, as the Broncos are one of the deepest and strongest teams in football. It hasn’t been a one-man show in Denver; it has team wins to thank for its league-leading 12 wins in 15 games.\n\nFrom late-game comebacks to blowouts, the Broncos have continuously found ways to get wins at all costs this season. On both sides of the ball, Broncos players have stepped up in key moments and successfully built off their return to the postseason during the 2024 season. Hufanga and Prentice have both been named alternates in their first season with Denver, highlighting the front office’s success in bringing in talent that fits the roster and makes them better.\n\nDespite how big an honor it is to be named a Pro Bowler and even an alternate, the hope is that there will be no Broncos playing in the game. Instead, the players and Broncos fans would much rather see Denver preparing for a Super Bowl matchup after a year in which they have leaped becoming a true contender. For now, they’ll have to focus on securing the AFC West and the No. 1 seed in the AFC to get the coveted bye in round one of the playoffs.",

    "description": "The Highlanders had no answer for senior forward Tyler Bilodeau on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - Senior forward Tyler Bilodeau looked unstoppable on the court of Pauley Pavilion Tuesday against UC Riverside (6-8, 1-1) and he made that clear with a career-high 34 point performance to lead UCLA (10-3, 2-0) to a 97-65 victory.\n\nIt looked like a mismatch in play styles from the very beginning. The Highlanders' defense seemed set up to allow Bilodeau to break through in the paint and UCLA head coach Mick Cronin was well aware of that going into the game.\n\n\"They [UC Riverside] don't double, so I said, 'Buddy, you've got one night here where they're just going to let you keep dribbling until you shoot it. So go have fun.'\"\n\nHave fun is exactly what Bilodeau did. He shot 12-19 from the field, dominating in the post and even mixing it up with several fadeaway shots. In addition, he was freed up to shoot from beyond the arc in addition to his inside-the-paint dominance and landed four of his seven triples.\n\nNico Alba - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA forward Tyler Bilodeau (34) talking to coach during an NCAA basketball game against UC Riverside, Tuesday December 23rd, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAnticipating the matchup, Cronin slotted Bilodeau in the five throughout the game, a position he almost exclusively played last season, but hasn't touched as much with the presence of junior forward Xavier Booker. However, Cronin had Bilodeau there to complement his guard heavy rotation and put Bilodeau in a position to eat from under the rim against the Highlanders' outmatched bigs. Bilodeau's mobility and shooting skill gave him an advantage over his opponents playing the same position and he took full advantage of that.\n\n\"Whatever lineup works. Tyler's playing the five a lot recently. He's been getting open looks. Three guard lineup, we've been pushing in transition a lot more. We're just finding the groove before Big Ten,\" sophomore guard Trent Perry said.\n\nAnother major part of not just Bilodeau's big game, but the Bruins' scoring as a whole was the synergy between Bilodeau and senior guard Skyy Clark.\n\nWhile it was an off-day shooting wise for Clark, he was precise with his passing and ability to find open looks of his teammates. More than once Clark would use his signature mobility to draw defenders in before delivering a laser-sharp bounce pass to Bilodeau, who waited patiently under the rim.\n\nConversely, Bilodeau would use his size to box defenders out before shoving the ball off to a charging Clark and set a screen in the process to open up the lane, leading to a stunning one-two punch from the senior Bruins.\n\n\"It's great. We played together last year and carrying it over this year, we've just got a feel for each other's game,\" Bilodeau said. \"We know where we like it on the court. Just got to keep trying to build that chemistry and keep trying to win games,\" Bilodeau said.",

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals have a matchup this week against a terrible Bengals defense. The question is who will start at running back and wide receiver.",
    "fullText": "In Week 17, a struggling Arizona Cardinals offense will meet a common salve: the Cincinnati Bengals defense.\n\nThat group might be the worst single unit in the NFL. If not, it’s in a tight race with the Raiders offense. The Bengals rank 32nd in points allowed, 32nd in yards per game and 32nd in yards per play. For those needing a refresher, the NFL still has 32 teams.\n\nSo, the question is: Outside of Trey McBride, which Cardinals players will be in position to take advantage?\n\nAt wide receiver, the picture is complicated.\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. returned to action last week after missing two games with a heel injury, but he remained limited, playing just 51% of snaps and 62% of passing plays. His three targets matched a career low, outside of the two games that he has exited with concussions.\n\nEarlier in the week, head coach Jonathan Gannon was asked how Harrison emerged from the game and offered a mixed response.\n\n“Okay,” Gannon said. “I think he'll be ready for more. We'll see how it kinda goes here. Obviously, we had a plan for his reps, where he was at health wise. I know he wants to play more. So we'll see where he's at. Take it day by day.”\n\nOffensive coordinator Drew Petzing also acknowledged that Harrison is not at full strength.\n\n“Does it limit some of the things you're gonna do or some of the reps he's gonna get?” Petzing said. “Yes, maybe, at times.”\n\nBut despite Harrison’s limited role, his return still led to a decreased involvement for Michael Wilson.\n\nIn four games without Harrison, Wilson has averaged 10 catches on 15 targets for 125 yards. In the past two games that Harrison has played, those averages have dropped to three catches on five targets for 44 yards.\n\nGannon, though, noted that the Falcons prioritized taking away the Cardinals’ passing attack in last week’s game. They played cover-4 on 45.5% of snaps, roughly double the season-long rate of cover-4 that the Cardinals have faced. That was reflected in the target distribution, as 69% of Jacoby Brissett’s targets went to tight ends and running backs.\n\nThe Bengals deploy cover-4 at just a 5.2% rate, opening more opportunities for outside receivers. With Harrison still working through his heel injury, that could enable Wilson’s production to tick back up.\n\nAs expected, Michael Carter led the Cardinals' backfield in Week 16, following Bam Knight’s season-ending injury.\n\nCarter’s role, though, was smaller than anticipated. He saw 11 of the Cardinals’ 22 running back carries and played just 53% of snaps.\n\nEmari Demercado took five carries on a 32% snap share while Corey Kiner took six carries on a 16% snap share.\n\nBut when asked whether he anticipated Kiner seeing six carries again this week, Petzing instead took the opportunity to praise Carter.\n\n“I think it can always change based on the flow of the game and riding the hot hand and who's producing,” Petzing said. “I thought Michael did a really nice job in the run game, producing some explosive run gains. Really making some decisive runs and even some dirty runs that maybe were gonna be two or three-yard runs, turned them into four, five, six-yard runs.”\n\nAll nine of Kiner’s snaps came on one second-quarter drive, spelling Carter. That drive just happened to be the Cardinals’ longest of the game, at 13 plays, giving him more carries than expected.\n\nAs for Demercado, 17 of his 18 snaps either came on third-and-long or in end-of-half situations. That has been his role all season, as the Cardinals prefer to deploy him on passing downs.\n\nSo, what does that mean against the Bengals?\n\nCarter will likely be the early-down back, with Demercado playing passing downs and Kiner offering a change-of-pace option. If the Cardinals are leading, Carter could be more involved, while Demercado will see more usage if they find themselves trailing, as is typically the case.\n\nBut if the Bengals opt for a more typical defensive gameplan than the Falcons did — with fewer light boxes and shell coverages ­— the Cardinals could struggle to replicate their run efficiency. Their 5.7 yards per carry last week were their second most of the season.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, tight end Trey McBride and safety Budda Baker were the only two Cardinals’ players named to the Pro Bowl. Edge rusher Josh Sweat was named as an alternate.\n\nMcBride is having one of the best tight end seasons in NFL history, with 109 catches for 1,098 yards and 10 touchdowns. With eight more catches, he would set the single-season record for catches by a tight end.\n\nBaker, meanwhile, has taken a step back from his typical elite-level play. He is among the league leaders in missed tackles and has not stopped as many run plays at or near the line of scrimmage — partially due to a thumb injury that has forced him to play with a cast. But he’s been one of the league’s most impactful defensive players for the past decade, a status that often earns players Pro Bowl recognition even in down seasons.\n\nMcBride and Baker were both on the Cardinals’ roster when the current staff was hired in 2023. That means that general manager Monti Ossenfort has not acquired a Pro Bowler in his three seasons in charge, unless Sweat is added to the roster.\n\nOssenfort was the only general manager hired in 2023 but, as a comparison, eight general managers were hired in 2021 or 2022. All eight acquired at least one Pro Bowler in their first three seasons.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Assessing Cardinals' Michael Carter, Michael Wilson roles for Week 17",

    "fullText": "After a record-setting 2024, where Gangwon FC managed a second-place finish and qualified for the AFC Champions League Elite for the first time in their history, interest was high on what the Bears could achieve this year. With that in mind, columnist Nathan Sartain recaps Gangwon’s 2025, where the team followed-up on their newfound success with a commendable fifth-placed finish.\n\nIn a season of heavy transition, with Jung Kyung-ho taking his first step into a Head Coach role following the departure of record-breaking manager Yoon Jong-hwan, as well as key players Hwang Mun-ki (military service) and Yang Min-hyeok leaving, Gangwon can look back on their Final A finish as a success. Sure, it wasn’t always pretty, and their eventual fifth-placed spot was largely earned through a revival of form in the second-half of the campaign, but in a year where expectations on what the Bears could achieve had grown, the provincial club made some solid steps towards showing their desire to match loftier ambitions.\n\nA large factor in Gangwon’s respectable year was their considerable defensive improvements. Conceding 15 less goals than in 2024, the Bears also kept 15 clean sheets, the joint-highest amount in K League 1 alongside the title winners Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. And the team needed this solidity too, given that 11 of their 13 victories were won by a one-goal margin, including seven 1-0 triumphs.\n\nLooking far more composed and structured in defence, Jung Kyung-ho’s philosophy of limiting opposition teams to lower quality chances was a fair tactic to deploy, so much so that once some summer signings and military returnees reinvigorated the attacking line, Gangwon would lose only three of their final 19 league matches (seven wins, nine draws), and remain unbeaten in their Gangneung home. So yes, the team mightn’t have grabbed the same amount of headlines this time around, but attaining the club's second-highest finish, second-highest points total, and a likely AFC Champions League Two spot for 2026 is nothing to hand-wave.\n\nIn 2024, Yoon Jong-hwan had Gangwon firing in attack, and they went on to score 62 times across the season, the joint-highest in the division (whilst breaking the club’s record for goals in a season). This year, however, the Bears managed just 37 goals, the lowest total across K League 1.\n\nIt wasn’t just an issue with being clinical, either. Jung Kyung-ho’s men had the second-lowest xG total in the top-flight (43.8), the second-lowest shots on target total (3.8 per 90), and ranked ninth for big chances created (55). Missing Yang Min-hyeok and Hwang Mun-ki’s potency, Gangwon couldn’t really find avenues to create consistent goals in the first part of the season, but did eventually find a rhythm once a settled attacking quartet of Kim Dae-won, Kim Gun-hee, Lee Sang-Jeon and Mo Jae-hyun was established. Nevertheless, they will need more creativity in 2026 to avoid potential over reliance on defensive work.\n\nA reliable hand at centre-back, Shin Min-ha assuredly took on an increased role with the team in 2025, where he was trusted to start the majority of league games. Playing with a variety of partners in both three-back and four-back systems, the 20-year-old prospect largely kept a decent level of consistency too, averaging (per 90) 1.01 tackles, 3.84 duels won, 1.55 interceptions, and 2.98 recoveries.\n\nWith Shin Min-ha now set to “graduate” from Gangwon's symbolic number 47 shirt given to promising youngsters, the goal for the centre-back should be to continue establishing himself as one of K League 1’s finest young defenders, fine-tune some areas of his game, and remain on course to become another one of the Bears' standout squad members, regardless of age.\n\nDespite only signing in the summer, Mo Jae-hyun was one of Gangwon’s biggest catalysts for their eventual Final A finish. With five goals and five assists in K League 1 action, the winger contributed to 27% of his team’s goals this season, his directness helping transform the Bears’ style of play to a more proactive, front-footed approach.\n\nPer 90, Mo Jae-hyun averaged 4.15 touches in the opposition box, 1.4 chances created, 3.55 recoveries,  1.76 shots, and an xG total of 0.2. Helped by having players like Kim Gun-hee around him, the 29-year-old’s goal contributions also directly contributed to an uplift of nine points for Gangwon too, enough to showcase his creative spark whilst also ensuring the Bears were never in any danger of being pulled towards danger.\n\nThough not necessarily his own fault, Mario Cuze has to go down as one of the Bears’ biggest what-ifs in 2025. Signed in the winter for a relatively significant fee, the winger only appeared three times for Gangwon before being loaned back to his former club Zrinjski Mostar, where he has scored three goals in 14 appearances.\n\nWhether the Croatian failed to adapt to his new surroundings, if he struggled finding a place in a team that had undergone a significant squad overhaul, or if it was a combination of a wide range of factors some of which will never be known, the fact Mario Cuze is unlikely to return to the provincial club means his potential impact will remain a mystery.\n\nIn the last couple of years, Gangwon have prided themselves on sustainable recruitment. Not only have the club invested heavily in younger players, as well as seeking out hidden gems from lower divisions and rough diamonds from across the top-flight, but they have also managed to generate decent revenue from key sales of homegrown talent (namely Yang Hyun-jun to Celtic, and Yang Min-hyeok to Tottenham).\n\nWith that being said, a lot of success in 2025 came thanks to the summer arrivals of Kim Gun-hee and Mo Jae-hyun, experienced players who are 30 and 29 respectively. So with the top-flight now increasingly competitive, is now the time for a slight tweak to Gangwon’s recruitment processes? And, at least this season, should the Bears attempt to push forward by acquiring some more established names to bridge the gap between their short and long term goals? After all, the club only have three outfield players over the age of 30 in their squad, so more experience arriving may not be a bad idea.\n\nArguably more importantly, though, is the need for the club to retain its star players. In a marked difference from just a couple of years ago, Gangwon now have a considerable amount of quality in the ranks that could generate interest from other clubs, whether it be players with high ceilings like Lee Seung-won, Shin Min-ha and Park Sang-hyeok, or seasoned professionals such as Kim Dae-won, Lee You-hyeon and Seo Min-woo. Retaining the majority of their current squad might just give Jung Kyung-ho an edge over other sides in a different way, and reinforce the overall need for a quality, not quantity approach to the winter market when it comes to the necessary attacking and defensive reinforcements, whoever they may be.",

    "fullText": "Alvin Kamara makes it clear again: He only wants to be a New Orleans Saint originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSince the November trade deadline, Alvin Kamara’s name has surfaced repeatedly in speculation that the New Orleans Saints could move on from the 30-year-old running back.\n\nCompounding the uncertainty, Kamara has not played or practiced since Week 12 while dealing with knee and ankle injuries.\n\nLooking ahead to next season, the Saints are also high on rookie Devin Neal, though he is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury and has been placed on injured reserve. That has only fueled questions about whether New Orleans will revisit the possibility of trading Kamara this offseason.\n\nAt the trade deadline, Kamara made his stance clear on the idea of being dealt, saying he would go drink a “piña colada somewhere” if traded—suggesting he would rather retire than play for another team. He expanded on those comments during an appearance this week on “The Set with Terron Armstead.”\n\n\"I saw a lot of people looking at that and saying, like, I was holding the Saints hostage by saying that if they traded me, I would retire,\" Kamara said. \"Which is not at all what I was saying. What I was saying was the same thing I've said my whole career. I want to be in New Orleans, right? Period. In the simplest of forms. I want to be in New Orleans.\n\n\"If I were to have to play football somewhere else, then I don’t want to play football, that's all I was saying. It's the trade deadline, so things get read into a little bit more. It's like 'Well, they went to Alvin and asked him if he wanted to be traded. And he told Mickey Loomis that if they trade him...' I wasn't holding anybody hostage. At the end of the day, that entity, that team, they swing the gavel. So, I'm never going to go up there and be like if you trade me, I'm going to go home.\"\n\nFrom his perspective, Kamara said he wasn’t trying to hold the organization hostage — he simply wants to remain in New Orleans.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles has seen the pitchforks be sharpened with each passing week as his team is in the middle of a run of form that has seen them lose six of their last seven games.\n\nWhile Todd did state he was \"fine\" earlier this week, there is no denying that the head coach is under serious pressure to make the postseason.\n\nNeeding to win out to make the playoffs, after the loss to the Carolina Panthers, many fans wanted Bowles removed as head coach.\n\nSo, some sections of the fan base aren't on Todd's side, but is Baker Mayfield?\n\n\"Yeah, I mean my narrative is not going to change, and our goals are still right in front of us,\" Mayfield said. \"Would we like to be in a different position? Yeah, we would like to have closed this thing out by now, but that's not where we're at. We have to win at Miami and then come back home.\n\n\"Our focus right now is doing everything we possibly can to find a way to win in Miami and see what happens from there.\"\n\nMore:Baker Mayfield has best response to Buccaneers getting out of form slump\n\nPossibly, and most fans would say he is.\n\nBut Bowles is contracted through to the 2028 season, per ESPN, so if they were to move on, it would be a serious financial outlay.\n\nPlus, Bowles only signed that extension this past offseason, at the same time as general manager Jason Licht. So, I find it hard to see a world where Tampa Bay moves on after giving Bowles an extension.\n\nBut we know that teams are often quick to pull the trigger on firing people, so if the Buccaneers do miss the playoffs, there's no denying that in the 2026 season, Todd might be on the hottest of head coaching hot seats.\n\nHow Panthers' Week 16 win over Buccaneers impacts division race, playoff picture\n\nUpdated chances for Tampa Bay to make 2025 NFL postseason after Week 16 loss to Panthers\n\nIs Emeka Egbuka playing today?

Kellis high school girls basketball game early in the Nike Tournament of Champions at Arizona Athletic Grounds in Mesa on Monday, Dec. 22.\n\nTempe McClintock coach David Williams told The Arizona Republic that a heated exchange among the game's spectators during McClintock's late second-half surge led to a fight.\n\n“There were some crazy, negative talking going on and that’s just part of the culture we live in now,\" Williams said. \"I know my people tried to ignore (him), but it went from there.\"\n\nDuring the consolation game for 11th place in the tournament's John Anderson division, McClintock (13-2) was on a huge run from the end of the third quarter into the fourth, and gained a two-point lead at 2:12 left to play. That's when the fight began, resulting in a decision to end the game early.\n\nWithout McClintock's top player, Lamaiya Woodberry (illness), juniors Anna Egorova and Niya Gamble and senior Ashley Shaw led the Chargers' 18-point swing. Williams was unaware of how the fracas began, but was more focused on McClintock's performance before chaos ensued at the early morning game.\n\n“I guess they had a couple (Kellis) girls that did some things to a parent, arguing or something, I don’t know,\" Williams said. \"I’m not just saying that to be stupid. No, I’m coaching my girls. Then somebody said, ‘Coach, look!'\"\n\nWilliams said the fight involved one of his player's relatives, but none of his players were part of the incident.\n\n\"Me and the coaches were trying to see what we could do to preserve the respect for the game,\" Williams said. \"It got outrageous to me. Like, who would fight over a damn basketball game at 10 o’clock in the morning?”\n\nThe Republic reached out to Kellis coach Shanelle Balark, but she was made unavailable for comment.\n\nThe incident is currently under investigation by Mesa police.

    "fullText": "GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Green Bay Packers quarterback Malik Willis says his throwing shoulder is feeling better and that he expects to be available for Saturday’s game against Baltimore if starter Jordan Love remains in the concussion protocol.\n\n“I try to take it one day at a time, but I would assume that I’m going to be ready,” Willis said Tuesday.\n\nThe Packers held a walk-through on Tuesday, and Love and Willis were both limited participants.\n\nWillis took over for the injured Love in the second quarter of a 22-16 overtime loss at Chicago last weekend. He landed on his right shoulder while getting sacked on the final play of the fourth quarter. Willis stayed in the game and connected with Jayden Reed for a 31-yard completion in overtime, though the Packers eventually turned the ball over on downs.\n\n“The adrenaline’s pumping and, you know, we got to get in,” Willis said of playing through the injury. “We don’t have anybody else, so we’ve got to keep going. It was fun.”\n\nThe Packers may need Willis again on Saturday as they try to secure a playoff spot.\n\nThe Packers (9-5-1) would lock up an NFC wild-card berth if they win one of their final two games or the Detroit Lions lose one of their last two. The Lions visit Minnesota on Thursday.\n\nBaltimore has its own uncertain quarterback situation after a back bruise knocked two-time MVP Lamar Jackson out of the Ravens’ 28-24 loss to New England on Sunday night. The Ravens would be eliminated from the playoffs with a loss.\n\nThis matchup could mean plenty for Willis, who is set to become an unrestricted free agent after the season. The 2022 third-round pick out of Liberty has made the most of his limited opportunities with Green Bay.\n\nWillis played well against the Bears, going 9 of 11 for 121 yards and a touchdown while rushing for 44 yards on 10 carries.\n\nThe 26-year-old has completed 76.5% of his passes with five touchdowns and no interceptions since the Packers acquired him from Tennessee before the 2024 season. Willis completed 53% of his passes with three interceptions and no touchdowns in two seasons with the Titans.\n\nGreen Bay won both of Willis' two starts last season, including a 30-14 victory at Tennessee.\n\n“I think he’s done a hell of a job, man,” coach Matt LaFleur said. “I think it’s all about his approach, how he came in here, how open he was to being coached. We were pretty hard on him and his footwork, and he’s done an outstanding job. I feel like the more he plays, the better he’s gotten. It’s great to have a guy like him you have so much confidence in.”\n\nWillis says there’s a “night and day” difference in his comfort level with Green Bay’s offense compared with last season.\n\n“You’re just trying to learn the game plan each week and make sure you know what to do with the ball and how to get us lined up,” Willis said. “Now you can more focus on — you know why we’re calling these plays. Now you can focus more on the defense and how you want to attack them and just doing all the little things that help you be successful day in and day out.”\n\nNOTE: Rookie defensive end Collin Oliver was activated from the physically unable to perform list this week when tight end John FitzPatrick (Achilles tendon) went on injured reserve. Oliver, a fifth-round pick from Oklahoma State, said he tore his hamstring at the NFL scouting combine but never expected the recovery process to take this long. “I thought it would be 10-12 weeks when I had the surgery, and this is obviously far from what happened,” Oliver said. “I just had to take everything day by day. Now I’m here, I’m glad I’m here right now.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "In the eyes of one media outlet, Michigan State point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. has been one of the best at his position through the halfway point of the season.\n\nThe Field of 68 has released their mid-season All-American teams and Fears made the cut. Fears came in as a second team All-American selection by the popular college basketball media outlet.\n\nFellow Big Ten point guard Braden Smith of Purdue beat out Fears for the first team honors from The Field of 68.\n\nFears is a big reason for the Spartans strong start to the season, which currently has them ranked in the top 10 nationally. Fears is averaging just under a double-double through the first 12 games this season, with 10.8 points and 9.2 assists per game. Both of those numbers are notable jumps from what he averaged last season.\n\nIt's clear that Fears is a massive piece to the Spartans' success so far this season and will remain arguably the most important player for Michigan State. So it's both understandable and rewarding to see him get the acknowledgement he deserves from The Field of 68.\n\nClick on the post below to see the complete midseason honors and awards from The Field of 68:\n\n🚨 Mid-Season Awards 🚨@TheFieldOf68's 2nd Team All-Americans! 🏆\n\n⭐️ @MSU_Basketball's Jeremy Fears Jr.\n⭐️ @TexasTechMBB's Christian Anderson\n⭐️ @AlabamaMBB's Labaron Philon\n⭐️ @UNC_Basketball's Caleb Wilson\n⭐️ @TexasTechMBB's JT Toppin\n\n🔗 https://t.co/ChPx2cnnvl pic.twitter.com/gY2RHbHUIg\n\n— The Field of 68 (@TheFieldOf68) December 23, 2025\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "description": "The Vikings Are Always on the Naughty List",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings won an ugly 16-13 affair in the swamps of Jersey against the New York Giants to improve to 7-8 on the season.\n\nAnother injury to J.J. McCarthy overshadowed the victory, this time to his throwing hand. The good news appears to be that there are no broken bones, but his availability for the Christmas Day game on a quick turnaround looks unlikely. If he does indeed miss Thursday’s game, it will mark the seventh time this season he’ll be inactive. He has now missed 24 of 32 (75%) possible games since the start of the 2024 season. Not ideal.\n\n(NOTE: After Shawn completed his article, the Vikings did rule McCarthy out for Thursday’s game against Detroit)\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings and nice things go together like ketchup and ice cream. The final five games of the season were all about McCarthy and his development. With the competitive portion of the season over, it was the only thing worth looking forward to. And for once, things looked to be going our way. As a Vikings fan, that’s always a surefire sign that disappointment is making its way to the on-deck circle.\n\nWhile not as crisp as the previous two outings, there were still plenty of positives to take away from McCarthy’s first-half performance. He made a beautiful play under duress for a possible touchdown pass that Jordan Addison holds onto nine times out of 10. His fourth rushing touchdown of the year was a doozy and flashed the dual-threat potential that made me think he could develop into a smaller Josh Allen. His yards per pass attempt (7.7) remained far above the four games before his concussion, when he failed to hit 6.0. Heck, even his chemistry with Justin Jefferson looked to be improving. Yeah, I know, the interception. C’mon now. Yes, the ball placement could have been better, but Nailor catches that, well, nine times out of 10. Ditto the 96-yard pick-six that was fortunately called back. When it rains, it pours for this freakin’ team.\n\nBut, alas, we’re back in the holding pattern after Brian Burns came unblocked and sent McCarthy to the locker room for the rest of the game. And no, it was not Brian O’Neill’s fault. It was a well-schemed blitz, combined with McCarthy holding the ball too long on a tunnel screen. You try to look for positives in such things, so I guess it’s good the Vikings now know without a shadow of a doubt that they cannot go into 2026 without a top-flight (and costly) backup. I love McCarthy, but you’re only as good as your ability to stay on the field. And so far, he hasn’t been able to do that.\n\nThis may ruffle some feathers, but the ideal scenario would be to get Kirk Cousins back here. He looked like a lock to be cut before Michael Penix, Jr. partially tore his ACL. Now the situation is a little murkier. The Falcons may still opt to eat the $35 million in dead money rather than absorb the $57 million cap hit (6th highest in the NFL) to keep him on the roster, not knowing how much he’d even see the field. He’s the only guy who, with 100% confidence, could step right in and execute KOC’s offense at an exceptionally high level. I don’t care if the ideal backup candidate would require some trade capital. The best schematic fit for KOC’s offense is the best schematic fit. If Cousins isn’t cut, go for the next best option. Either way, it must be prioritized come March. The Vikings absolutely can’t go through another season like this. The roster is too good, and the expectations are too high.\n\nAgain, the best option for the Vikings is for McCarthy to hit the ground running in September, stay healthy, continue to improve, become elite, and win five Super Bowls over the next 10 years. But at this point, the only fact at hand is that he’s been incredibly injury-prone. You don’t let your wishes father your thoughts. You go with what is known.\n\nAt this point, Brian Flores can name his price. Making him the NFL’s highest-paid coordinator is a no-brainer. I’ve long been on record saying Flores deserved a second shot at an NFL head-coaching job. It’s beyond overdue. If I had to put money on it, I’d say it’s finally going to happen in a matter of weeks. Selfishly, I hope for a repeat of the Ben Johnson situation in Detroit in 2024, when he opted to stay to wait for the best possible opportunity.\n\nI don’t care who you’re playing. When you hold an NFL offense to 13 (!) net passing yards and six points, you’re in some ridiculous zone of awesomeness. With two weeks to go, the Vikings’ defense is Top 10 in the following categories (among others):\n\nYes, the run defense took a step back this season, and yes, the lack of generated turnovers matters, but the bottom line is this team has absolutely no right to still have a chance to finish the 2025 season with a winning record. The only reason we are here is Brian Flores.\n\nI feel dirty even suggesting this, but I’m torn about this Lions game. If McCarthy does indeed sit it out, it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if we… gulp… lose. If this were the Packers or the Bears, I’d never say that. Yes, we can ruin the Lions’ season. That would be good. But you always need to keep an eye on the future. First, a loss with our backup quarterback would give us a better draft position. We’re currently 15th, but there’s a logjam of eight teams between 6-9 and 8-7. Second, a loss will keep us in last place in the NFC North, and with it, the benefits of a more manageable 2026 schedule. Yes, I know that only affects three games, but would you rather face the Giants, Titans, and Cardinals or the Commanders, Colts, and 49ers/Rams?\n\nIt isn’t very meaningful at this point, but this is what I had to say about Week 17 back in May:\n\nWeek 17: Detroit Lions: I expect this to have significance for playoff seeding and/or deciding the NFC North crown. I had us win at Ford Field, so I’m not picking us to lose at home. With J.J. McCarthy gaining experience every week, and Flores’s defense (particularly the corners) hitting their stride. Detroit is the known entity; margins for improvement are limited. We get revenge on the Lions this year, not only for Week 18 in 2024, but for going 1-6 beginning with that dreadful December 2021 loss that likely sealed Zimmer’s fate. You know, the one where Detroit came in 0-10-1. T.J. Hockenson grabs a late TD over Kirby Joseph to win it. Oh yeah, that works.\n\nNote to self: Do not write another “crystal-ball” article next spring. If you do, channel George Costanza and do the opposite.\n\nAs for everything I stated above about this game, the pros and cons, the cost-benefit analysis, the nuanced perspective, etc. – Just Kidding!!! I never want the Vikings to lose….ever. And to the freakin’ Lions? Pfft. I want to play spoiler and see Dan Campbell’s bunch watch the playoffs from home. I want to lean on that Super Bowl window even more to push it closed. I want it to achieve an airtight seal. And to do it with Max Brosmer? That would almost make up for this disappointing season. Well, no, that’s legit BS, but it would still be highly gratifying.",

However, that was because the referees did not see the interaction.\n\nHe appeared to be the one who initiated the physical contact with the fan, which means his situation is unlike that of Lamar Jackson's earlier in 2025, when the Baltimore Ravens quarterback pushed a Bills fan who had slapped his teammate's helmet. In that instance, the NFL did not punish Jackson, as the fan was banned from NFL stadiums and the matter was \"addressed by the club,\" per ESPN.\n\nWhen a player initiates the physical interaction with a fan, it's typically a different story for the league. Metcalf is now set to miss the Steelers' final two regular-season games; he will also be missing out on $277,777 per game check, per Jonathan Jones.\n\nMORE:What to know about the NFL's personal conduct policy\n\nMetcalf will be eligible to return to the Steelers roster on Monday, Jan. 5, after Week 18 is over.\n\nThat means he will miss Pittburgh's final two games of the regular season against the Browns and Ravens.\n\nHere's the moment Metcalf was seen hitting a Lions fan in Sunday's game.\n\nCBS reporter Tracy Wolfson said the fan said something to Metcalf before he swiped at him.\n\nPer ESPN, the Detroit Free Press spoke to the fan in the altercation, and he identified himself as Ryan Kennedy from Pinckney, Michigan.

    "description": "With Opening Day three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business.",
    "fullText": "For the Atlanta Braves, 2025 was an avalanche of disappointment.\n\nEntering the season on a seven-year postseason streak, the Braves were considered championship contenders, the National League’s best chance at unseating the juggernaut Dodgers. With a strong core of experienced position players, the NL’s reigning Cy Young in Chris Sale and a pair of superstars coming back from injury in Ronald Acuña Jr. and Spencer Strider, Atlanta began the season with 93.4% playoff odds, according to FanGraphs.\n\nInstead, a depleted, injury-plagued Braves club trudged to a shocking 76-86 record and a fourth-place finish in a down NL East.\n\nThankfully, the autopsy is pretty straightforward. Sale and key rotation piece Spencer Schwellenbach both spent long stretches on the IL. The same was true for third baseman Austin Riley, who underperformed when available. Strider looked rusty and out of sync upon his return from Tommy John. Stalwarts such as Ozzie Albies, Michael Harris II, Marcel Ozuna and Sean Murphy all struggled offensively. The emergence of NL Rookie of the Year Drake Baldwin was an invigorating development, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the simple fact that too many important players spent too much time watching baseball instead of playing it.\n\nBut the future, at Truist Park, is not lost.\n\nBecause as disappointing as last season was for Atlanta, the club’s front office has conducted business this winter like a team fully expecting to contend in 2026. President of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos is clearly treating 2025 as a blip, an aberration, a fluke. With the new year still a week away, Atlanta’s head honcho has arguably done more to reinforce his roster than any other exec.\n\nThe Braves have signed six MLB free agents, a tally that ranks second so far this offseason behind the Cubs. To that sextet, Atlanta has guaranteed more than $106 million, the fifth-largest outlay as of Tuesday. The spending itself is not particularly shocking — the Braves have always run a top-10 payroll under Anthopoulos — but the team’s unflinching aggression is a reminder that the Braves are still a formidable presence in the National League.\n\nTo be fair, none of Atlanta’s additions was significant enough to warrant an in-person, jersey-unveiling press conference. But the Braves are undoubtedly a better, more complete and deeper team now than they were two months ago.\n\n[Get more Atlanta news: Braves team feed]\n\nFormer Padres closer Robert Suárez was probably the newsiest acquisition, with the soon-to-be 35-year-old flamethrower joining on a three-year, $45 million contract. It’s a long commitment for a reliever approaching his baseball golden years, but Suárez still throws absolute gas and has been one of the league’s most reliable closers over the past few years. His 76 saves since the start of 2024 are the most in baseball.\n\nBut don’t expect that number to rise much higher, as Suárez won’t begin the year as Atlanta’s closer. That’s because the Braves also re-signed Raisel Iglesias, their longtime closer, on a one-year, $16 million deal. He’ll continue to handle the ninth, and new skipper Walt Weiss will deploy Suárez in the Swiss Army knife, fireman role. Veterans Joel Payamps and Danny Young were also brought in on one-year deals to bolster a bullpen that finished 19th in baseball with a 4.19 ERA in 2025.\n\nAnthopoulos and Co. have been busy refurbishing the offensive side as well. Back in November, Atlanta  swung a one-for-one deal with Houston, acquiring utilityman Mauricio Dubón in exchange for defensive wizard Nick Allen. Dubón isn’t a particularly good hitter, but he provides a lot of defensive versatility and is a perfectly capable bat. The Braves followed that deal with a pair of more needle-moving signings in shortstop Ha-Seong Kim and outfielder Mike Yastrzemski.\n\nKim spent the final month of 2025 with the Braves after the club claimed him off waivers from the Tampa Bay Rays. That move was motivated by the hope that Kim wouldn’t activate his opt-out and Atlanta would have itself an every-day shortstop for 2026. Instead, the Korean glovesmith decided to test free agency, a smart decision as it turned out. Kim, who was set to receive $16 million, ended up back in Atlanta on a one-year, $20 million deal.\n\nThat’s a hefty investment for a player who was both hurt and bad in 2025, but Kim has been an average big-league hitter for most of his career while providing ample value at the game’s most difficult infield spot. For the Braves, whose shortstops finished dead last in baseball a year ago, with a putrid 56 wRC+, it’s a price worth paying.\n\nYastrzemski, who joined on a two-year, $23 million deal, is an unspectacular yet remarkably consistent corner outfielder. The 35-year-old has been worth at least 2.0 bWAR in every one of his seven big-league seasons and has a career .809 OPS against right-handed pitching. Although he’ll likely sit against most lefty starters, Yaz will provide depth in the corners behind Acuña and Jurickson Profar while mixing in at designated hitter.\n\nThat Atlanta has DH at-bats to dole out is a development in its own right. Since Opening Day 2023, Marcell Ozuna has started 445 of Atlanta’s 502 games, postseason included. Now a free agent for the first time in his career, Ozuna usually hit enough to justify clogging up the Braves’ DH spot. But at this point, a reunion feels unlikely, as the Braves can use that space to cycle through Yastrzemski, Profar and whoever isn’t catching that day (Murphy or Baldwin).\n\nWith Opening Day still three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business. Anthopoulos added a pair of every-day bats, a valuable utility guy, two high-leverage relievers and some potentially useful pitching depth. Atlanta could enter the season with its current assortment of ballplayers, and prognosticators and projection systems alike would consider this a playoff team.\n\nBut if the Braves want to push the issue, there’s still one more area ripe for a splash: the starting rotation. Sale, now fully healthy, will lead the line as he prepares to hit free agency at season’s end. Behind him, there’s Strider (looking to recapture his pre-surgery form), Schwellenbach (missed the last few months of ‘25 due to a fractured elbow), Reynaldo Lopez (made just one start in ‘25 before undergoing shoulder surgery) and youngster Hurston Waldrep (impressed in a nine-start sample but remains unproven). Grant Holmes, Bryce Elder and Didier Fuentes follow as depth options.\n\nIf things break right, that’s a really interesting group with tons of upside. It’s also a group that has shown to be particularly susceptible to the injury bug. That’s what derailed Atlanta’s plans last season, and the same thing could easily happen again.\n\nTo lessen that possibility, the Braves could add one more impact starter to the group. Such a move, given the organization’s middling farm system, would probably have to come via free agency. Atlanta is already over the luxury tax by around $6 million, according to Spotrac. Cashing out for a big arm such as Zac Gallen, Tatsuya Imai or Framber Valdez would push the Braves well over the tax, something the organization is wary of doing.\n\nBut money is just money, and the Braves cannot afford another disappointing season. They’ve done a good job, so far this winter, of avoiding a replay of 2025, but one more big swing could make them quite a formidable character in 2026.",

I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n\nLions officials talked to him, and he was not thrown out of the game.\n\nMORE: Will DK Metcalf be suspended by NFL for punching fan?\n\nThe public may never officially know the truth behind what caused the incident. Kennedy told the Detroit Free Press after the game that he called the wide receiver by his legal name, causing the outburst.\n\nSources told NFL Network's Tom Pelissero that Kennedy and Metcalf have history. Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy last year when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and he reported the fan to stadium security.\n\nChad Ochocino said on a live stream appearance with Shannon Sharpe that sources told him that the fan called Metcalf a racial slur, and then made derogatory comments about the player's mother, but none of these claims have been confirmed.\n\nMetcalf's real name is DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, but he prefers to go by DK.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture in Week 16\n\nAfter the claims from Ochocinco that Kennedy used racial or derogatory language against Metcalf, the Lions fan, via his lawyer, released a statement denying that report.\n\nThe statement reads, \"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game. These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nGiven that the incident is now likely going to be a legal matter, Kennedy had no further comment at this time.\n\nRyan Kennedy, the fan involved in the DK Metcalf altercation Sunday, has issued a statement through an attorney “categorically denying using the “N-word,” the “C-word,” or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident.\n\n“These allegations are completely false.” pic.twitter.com/pQUbBYa0ww\n\n— Brooke Pryor (@bepryor) December 22, 2025\n\nHere is the initial clip that went viral on social media.\n\n#Steelers WR DK Metcalf upset with a fan… pic.twitter.com/eoZJjIiXHw\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 21, 2025\n\nHere is the clip released later from a different angle.\n\nAnother angle of the DK Metcalf incident with a #Lions fan during Sunday’s game:\n\n(via alexhamed3/IG, h/t @BussinWTB)pic.twitter.com/YTEjVwDZcohttps://t.co/d0lOJ9lu8e\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 22, 2025\n\nAnd a third look at the incident released the day after.\n\nAnother angle of the DK Metcalf incident with a Lions fan has been released....\n\n(via keiffer_kennedy/IG, h/t @premefootball)pic.twitter.com/CwXWQZqAuIhttps://t.co/Ej5KLXFtUz\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 22, 2025\n\nIt was reported the morning after the incident that Metcalf may actually have a history with Kennedy.\n\nAccording to Pelissero, Metcalf may have run into Kennedy at a Seahawks game last season, and the wide receiver may have reported him to stadium security.\n\nHow Travis Kelce's retirement decision is easy with no Patrick Mahomes\n\nPanthers take control of NFC South with massive win over Buccaneers\n\nMyles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record with obscure half sack\n\nGardner Minshew suffers potential ACL tear in first Chiefs game without Patrick Mahomes\n\nQuinshon Judkins out for season after gruesome leg injury vs. Bills",

    "description": "In October, Seattle cut the 9th-year backup tight end from a school that doesn’t give football scholarships. Now look what he’s done.",
    "fullText": "How unlikely a Seahawks hero is Eric Saubert?\n\nHe’s supposed be crunching numbers behind a desk somewhere, not propelling Seattle into its first postseason in three years.\n\nThe man who caught the Seahawks’ most important pass so far this season, the most impacting catch of his nine, nomadic years in the NFL, is a former university Presidential Scholar. He has a bachelor’s of science degree in actuarial science.\n\nYou know, that science of using mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to analyze the economic costs of risk and uncertainty in everyday events. The stuff so many NFL players (don’t) dabble in.\n\n“I wasn’t every good at it, to be honest,” Saubert said with a grin at his locker in Seahawks headquarters Tuesday.\n\nThe native of Chicago, a middle child of four kids, did not have a major-college football scholarship. So he played at Drake. The private school in Des Moines, Iowa, is known as a mid-major power in basketball. Drake gives no athletic scholarships for football. Yet it competes at and beats other Football Championship Subdivision (former Division I-AA) programs.\n\n“I’m super-thankful for going there, too, man, because a lot that shaped me into who I am,” he said Tuesday. “I wouldn’t want it any other way.”\n\nIn 2017 he became the first Drake player in 34 years drafted into the NF, by the Falcons in the fifth round. Despite not being a regular starter, he’s playing his ninth season in the league. He’s been a special-teams stalwart and a backup, blocking tight end for eight teams in nine years. He’s gone from Atlanta to Chicago to Jacksonville to Dallas to Houston to San Francisco to Seattle.\n\nThe Seahawks signed him as free agent this past March. They cut him in October.\n\nHe came back, on faith that Seattle general manager John Schneider and coach Mike Macdonald would be true to their word and give Saubert a better deal than he signed last spring. His original Seahawks contract was a veteran salary-benefit deal. Those cannot be extended during the season.\n\nSchneider and Macdonald told Saubert in late October, after he had one catch in seven games, to hang tight for two days while they cut him in some more of the team’s constant roster gymnastics. He was briefly an unrestricted free agent.\n\nHe did as told. He hung out for a couple days. He ignored possibly signing with another team. He re-signed with the one that cut him.\n\nThe Seahawks gave him an in-season extension, rare for the team. It’s paying him a signing bonus up front of $500,000 plus a proration on a $1.3 million salary for 2025. That’s just over the league veteran minimum for his nine years. More important to him, he got a new deal for 2026. That could be worth over $2.1 million.\n\n“The organization is all class since I’ve been here,” Saubert told The News Tribune this month. “I appreciate them so much for getting this deal worked out. I’m so happy to be here for another year.”\n\nThen a week after he re-signed, Saubert went on injured reserve with a calf injury. Many teams would shelve a backup tight end on IR for the rest of the season once he got hurt in November. The Seahawks told Saubert how valuable he was to their run-first offense, that they intended to have him back healthy for a push to the playoffs.\n\nThey activated him from IR Dec. 13. He played the next day, in Seattle’s win over Indianapolis.\n\nThen last week in overtime of a wild game against the Los Angeles Rams with massive playoff implications at Lumen Field, the tight end with two catches in 15 games was blocking Rams 2024 NFL defensive rookie of the year Jared Verse. Quarterback Sam Darnold looked to his right at three receivers while trying to throw on the game-deciding two-point conversion play. Saubert blocked Verse some more. And some more.\n\nNo receiver was open. The Rams even covered running back Zach Charbonnet, who had drifted out into the left flat behind the line of scrimmage as the fourth, safety-valve option on the play.\n\nSo Saubert released from his blocking into a short pass route of about 4 yards, to just inside the goal line.\n\nWhen he turned his head left, Darnold appeared almost startled at how open Saubert was in the end zone. The Pro Bowl QB aimed his pass like he was throwing a dart. It stuck to Saubert for the two-point play.\n\nEric Saubert : Caught the game-winning 2-point conversion in OT pic.twitter.com/GvF1dCwdTI\n\n— Lee Harvey (@Sayian_Warrior) December 19, 2025\n\nThe guy who has three career touchdown receptions in 110 career games, who’s never played in an NFL game, completed Seattle’s comeback from down 16 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nSeahawks fans packing Lumen Field roared a noise not heard often inside that stadium in the last 10 years. Saubert held the ball triumphantly aloft in his right hand, basking in the rare roars. Then he chucked the ball as high as he could into the noise.\n\n“It’s incredible,” he said about a half hour later, inside the locker room after blaring music.\n\n“I’m kinda last in the progression. Sam is amazing. He knows his progression all the way through. I chipped. Come under late. Sam found me.\n\nSaubert put the Seahawks (12-3) two wins in their final two games, including Sunday at Carolina (8-7), from the NFC West title and top seed with the lone bye in the conference’s playoffs next month.\n\n“They’ve got two great edge rushers,” Saubert said of the Rams. “So we had a big chip-protection plan for them last week (with the tight ends helping the interior offensive linemen). That’s a huge part of the play, as well.”\n\nSaubert credited Josh Jones, the veteran swing tackle who made his first Seattle start against L.A. because Charles Cross was out injured. Jones kept his block long and well enough for Saubert to release his, and for Darnold to wait for his fifth receiving option to emerge.\n\nGiven he’s caught just three passes in the end zone in nine years, Saubert agreed he’s never had a bigger catch than that one that shook Lumen Field.\n\n“Yeah, no, I don’t think as meaningful as that one,” he said. “It’s a pretty cool moment.\n\n“Clinched the playoffs. Make us the one seed (for now).”\n\n“I’ve always had this belief in myself,” Saubert said at his locker inside Seahawks headquarters before practice Tuesday. “And it sounds crazy, even going to Drake, but I knew there was something inside of me. And I knew if I got stronger, faster, that I could do something special.”\n\nLast Thursday night, he did. “Just a phenomenal play, man,” Macdonald said of Saubert’s final catch for the winning two points.\n\n“Pretty good feeling when he caught it.”\n\nDarnold, himself forgotten after failed seasons as a starter discarded by the Jets and Panthers to begin his NFL career a year after Saubert began his, appreciates his backup tight end’s perseverance. All eyes, including the Rams’, were on NFL leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, former Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp and Pro Bowler Rashid Shaheed out on pass routes during the season’s biggest play in overtime last Thursday.\n\nYet it was Eric Saubert, the actuarial science guy from Drake, who made the winning play.\n\n“It’s unbelievable, man,” Darnold said. “That’s the beauty of the NFL. You have all these guys. You have JSN, ‘Shid, you have guys like Coop that make all these plays. And the guy that wins the game is ‘Sauby.’\n\n“He’s been in the league for so long. And I’m just very happy for him.”\n\nNot as happy as Saubert is that he isn’t behind a desk somewhere doing that other job he has a degree for.\n\n“Shout out to the actuaries,” he said.\n\n\"But I wouldn’t be having as much fun.”",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers have been dealing with injuries to key players lately. Austin Reaves, Deandre Ayton, Rui Hachimura and Luka Doncic have all suffered ailments over the last week or two, and it is one reason the team has won just four of its last eight games.\n\nWhen Los Angeles takes on the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday to wrap up a four-game road trip, it will still be without Doncic and Hachimura. Ayton will return to action after missing two games due to elbow soreness.\n\nReaves was originally listed as questionable for Tuesday's game. But he will play versus Phoenix, which will give L.A. a big boost.\n\nAustin Reaves has been upgraded to available for tonight against PHX, the Lakers announced. He will return after a three game absence because of a mild left calf strain.\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 23, 2025\n\nReaves is averaging 27.8 points and 6.7 assists a game while shooting 50.3% from the field and 36.9% from 3-point range so far this season. In 21 games, he has hit the 40-point mark three times already, and he had a new career high of 51 points on Oct. 26 versus the Sacramento Kings.\n\nHe has a history of putting up big scoring numbers whenever either Doncic or LeBron James has been out, and that is exactly what it will likely take for the Lakers to defeat a potent and feisty Suns squad.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers give huge update on Austin Reaves before Tuesday's game vs Suns",

    "fullText": "MADISON – The transfer portal departures are starting to really hurt for the Wisconsin football program.\n\nDilin Jones, who started the first seven games before suffering a season-ending turf toe injury against Ohio State, will enter the transfer portal with three seasons of eligibility remaining. On3 reported his departure Dec. 23 and Jones reposted the report on his Instagram page.\n\nJones finished second on the team with 300 rushing yards. He averaged 3.9 yards per carry and scored two touchdowns. His longest run of the season was 16 yards.\n\nHe opened the season with a season-high 73 yards in 14 carries in a 17-0 win over Miami (Ohio). His oher top performances were against Michigan (17 carries for 63 yards and one touchdown) and Iowa (16 carries for 69 yards), but most of his work came during a stretch of the season when the offensive line's struggles were their worst.\n\nJones was part of a 2024 recruiting class that also featured running backs Darrion Dupree and Gideon Ituka. Both players started two games after Jones' injury. Dupree led UW with 363 yards in 83 carries, a 4.4-yard average. Ituka ran for 255 yards in 60 attempts, an average of 4.3 yards per carry.\n\nNews of Jones’ departure comes one day after news of promising freshman receiver Eugene Hilton’s exit.\n\nThe offense also lost starting slot receiver Trech Kekahuna and running back Cade Yacamelli.

    "title": "Patriots Power Rankings: High-stakes win boosts Pats up Santa’s Nice list",
    "description": "Check out where the Pats rank heading into Week 17",
    "fullText": "Here it is at the end of 2025 and I still can’t get over the turnaround from where we were last year. The Patriots were 3-12 heading into Week 17 and fans were rooting hard for a 3-14 finish to secure the overall No. 1 seed in the draft. That plan went about as well as anything else the team tried to do that year. A win over the Bills in the final game of the season dropped them to No. 4, but I’m not complaining. This season has been the polar opposite. New England had to be really bad for a couple years and hit bottom before it could rebound — and what a glorious recovery it’s been.\n\nMike Vrabel, Drake Maye and company have made football fun again. Frankly, that’s pretty much all I wanted on my NFL Christmas list this year, for the Patriots to be on a solid track back to relevancy. Fans have already received so much that anything more — like snagging the AFC East title from Buffalo (so close we can touch it), maybe being the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and then winning a playoff game or two (or three) — is gravy.\n\nGood things are all back on the table now, as the Pats prepare for a 3-12 Jets team that has lost their last 3 games by at least 23 points – and just lost QB Justin Fields to Injured Reserve. Meanwhile New England is a perfect 7-0 on the road. I have no doubt Mike Vrabel will be reminding his players about the big picture this week, needing to stay focused and not taking any wins for granted. Here’s to the Pats taking care of business at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, and I’m putting in a special request for no new injuries. Please, please, please Santa!\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) at New York Jets (3-12)\n\nBuffalo Bills (11-4) vs. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)\n\nMiami Dolphins (6-9) vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8)\n\nDenver Broncos (12-3) at Kansas City Chiefs (6-9)\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) at Indianapolis Colts (8-6)\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (9-6) at Cleveland Browns (3-12)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) vs. Houston Texans (10-5)\n\nBaltimore Ravens (7-8) at Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)\n\nCincinnati Bengals (5-10) vs. Arizona Cardinals (3-12)\n\nTennessee Titans (3-12) vs. New Orleans Saints (5-10)\n\nLas Vegas Raiders (2-13) vs. New York Giants (2-13)\n\n2nd – Pete Prisco (CBS Sports): Drake Maye’s showing vs. the Ravens helps his MVP chances. Coming back from 11 points down is a good sign for this young team as they ready for the playoffs. [+2]\n\n2nd – Eric Edholm (NFL.com): Down 11 points in the fourth quarter, on the road, with several key players injured, Drake Maye and the Patriots refused to die. Maye caught fire in the final quarter, leading two long touchdown drives, with Rhamondre Stevenson’s TD romp giving the Pats a lead they wouldn’t relinquish. The comeback win clinched a playoff berth for New England, moving the team into a dominant position to also claim the AFC East crown in the next two weeks. Losing Offensive Rookie of the Year candidate TreVeyon Henderson (concussion protocol) for any length of time would be a worry, and as mentioned above, that wasn’t the only notable health setback the Pats suffered in the game. They’re very thin on both lines of scrimmage right now but should eventually get help from players returning from IR, including OT Will Campbell and DT Milton Williams. They’ll be warmly welcomed back to a team that has outplayed all expectations and will be a fascinating case study in the postseason. [+3]\n\n2nd – Ralph Vacchiano (FOX Sports): Drake Maye’s MVP candidacy went into overdrive with a 380-yard, 2-touchdown performance and comeback against the Ravens. Now they might have a chance to clinch the AFC East next week. [+2]\n\n2nd – Vinnie Iyer (Sporting News): The Patriots went into more of an offensive slump in Baltimore with Drake Maye cooling and being contained again, putting their chances of stealing the AFC East in serious jeopardy. [+1] /Scratching my head over this one.\n\n4th – Frank Schwab (Yahoo! Sports): It’s not like the Patriots blew out the Ravens, who didn’t have Lamar Jackson for most of the game, but a loss would have made things a little more worrisome for them in the AFC East race. The Patriots won and their chances to win the AFC East race are at 80.9% with two games to play, via DVOA. They still have a 31.3% shot at the No. 1 seed too. It wasn’t the easiest win, but Drake Maye’s monster 380-yard game saved them from a rough loss. [nc]\n\n4th – NFL Nation (ESPN): Rookie of the year: Running back TreVeyon Henderson. He leads the team with 776 rushing yards on 146 carries (5.3 average), and has eight total touchdowns. Rookie left guard Jared Wilson described Henderson’s big-play threat this way: “Any time he touches the ball, it could end up in the end zone.” Henderson has four touchdown runs of 50 yards or more. The Patriots might be without him this week, however, as he exited Sunday’s game in the second quarter because of a concussion and didn’t return. — Mike Reiss. [nc]\n\n4th – Mike Florio (ProFootballTalk): The loss to Buffalo was a wake-up call. [+1]\n\n5th – Nate Davis (USA Today): QB Drake Maye had his first 300-yard passing game (380 actually) Sunday night, which included a career-high 31 completions. Definitely feels like the right time to put more on his plate. [+1]\n\n5th – Conor Orr (SI): I was struck watching the Patriots’ post-game interview how in line the entire team was—even Stefon Diggs. He deliberately sidestepped a question about the team’s playoff aspirations in a toned-down Q&A that revealed the totality of the Vrabel effect for me. It’s simply bigger than one person. [+1]\n\n5th – Diante Lee (The Ringer): The Patriots are ready for the playoffs.  New England didn’t see the best version of Baltimore on Sunday night—especially after QB Lamar Jackson exited with a back injury—but we still saw an inexperienced Patriots team ward off the Ravens in a game with major stakes.  After Baltimore’s defense sold out to stop New England’s run game, QB Drake Maye put the offense on his shoulders.  His efficiency in the fourth quarter didn’t just get the job done this week, it’ll be the reason why the Patriots win games in the playoffs.

    "title": "Americans Have Mixed Views of AI – and an Appetite for Regulation",
    "description": "A supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety.",
    "fullText": "AI is sweeping the American economy. A majority of Americans are either using AI tools or have tried them. But AI use is only half the story – a supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety. And many remain worried about potential job losses stemming from the emerging technology. \n\nIt’s time we did more to understand the national attitudes around AI use, regulation, and favorability.\n\nMost of our respondents had used AI at least once: 58% report using or trying AI, specifically tools like ChatGPT or Claude, divided evenly between fairly regular users (30% use at least a few times a month) and more infrequent users (29% have used AI, but only once a month or less). Nonusers are more likely to be older (62% of people over 65 have never used AI), not have gone to college (47%), or to work in service jobs (35%). Only 18% of white-collar workers say they have never used AI.\n\nAmong those who do use AI, 63% have at least tried it out for work purposes, and 34% report using it at work consistently (a few times a month or more). Work usage, like AI usage overall, is more common among white-collar workers, a majority of whom (55%) use it consistently. Personal use of AI is more common: 91% have at least tried using an AI chatbot or writing tool, and 54% report consistently using it in their personal lives. Gen Z turns to AI more often than its older counterparts, with 68% regularly engaging AI for personal use (compared to just 40% among Boomers).\n\nPersonal AI use encompasses a bunch of different types of application, but by far the most common is information gathering and answering questions (63%). Frequent AI users are especially likely to use AI as an alternative to traditional Google search or other research tools (68%). If this use case continues, messaging and communication on anything from public health to election campaigns will be filtered through AI models before reaching people. This could potentially change how messages are interpreted (particularly given the use of AI summaries), or significantly alter their reach in difficult-to-measure ways. Those interested in talking effectively to Americans should consider how their messaging strategy would work with these AI intermediaries, how their messages will be interpreted by AI, and if what they say will still reach their intended audience.\n\nWhile they know the names of the tools (ChatGPT, etc.), respondents don’t know much about the companies responsible for AI products. This is in contrast with older tech companies: Only 5% haven’t heard of Google, and 79% are favorable toward the company. For Amazon, favorability is at 80%. When asked about OpenAI, 42% hadn’t heard enough to form an opinion. For Anthropic, this figure hit 81%.\n\nAmericans don’t view AI as favorably as other emerging technologies from the past quarter century. Cell phones (76% total positive; net +68), the internet (75% total positive; net +66), and solar energy (72% total positive; net +65) are all viewed as having a very positive impact on society. AI (38% total positive; net +8) is \n\nWhen Americans are asked to think about potential future impacts on society, opinions of AI remain mixed, at a nearly even split of respondents between positive, negative, and uncertain impacts. Respondents believe that things like solar energy (70%), personalized medicine (57%), and nuclear energy (43%) will have positive future impacts, but are more skeptical of cryptocurrency (24% positive, 40% say it will have a negative impact) and self-driving cars (23% positive, 50% negative).\n\nWe also wanted to get a sense of how important Americans believe certain technologies to be. To provide some sense of perspective, we asked them to compare these new technologies to some they’re more familiar with. “Extremely important” corresponded to the steam engine and electricity, “moderately important” corresponded to the smartphone, and “not very” corresponded to the digital camera.\n\nWith these comparisons in mind, the median respondent puts AI on par with the invention of the smartphone. Only 7% believe that it’s more important than any other technology, with 16% of frequent AI users believing this, compared to just 5% of infrequent/nonusers.\n\nDespite uncertainty about AI’s overall importance, 70% of Americans say this technology will dramatically transform work, though they’re much less certain about the exact nature of this transformation. A plurality believes that it will make work easier (49%), but a majority believes that AI will bring down wages (55%), including pluralities or majorities across education, race, and partisanship. More respondents think it will hurt the economy (37%) than think it will decrease growth (29%), probably reflecting concern about wages. The perception that AI will replace human workers or outcompete them for jobs is a common one: 51% think AI will replace work done by humans, versus 33% who believe AI will supplement the work humans do. Service workers are especially convinced AI will replace (59%) rather than supplement (30%).\n\nA majority of Americans (56%) think that within 10 years, AI will be capable of performing most tasks that most people do at work. However, this drops significantly when respondents are asked about when AI will be able to do most tasks in their own job or field, with 43% thinking this will happen within 10 years, with no notable differences by educational attainment or work type. Customer service representatives are generally agreed to be replaceable within 10 years (64%), followed by accountants (56%) and manufacturing workers (54%). Fewer than 1 in 3 Americans think electricians, truck drivers, or doctors could be replaced by AI in the next 10 years.\n\nAround two-thirds of Americans (67%) are more concerned about the government doing too little to regulate the dangers of AI, versus doing too much and stifling progress (12%). At the same time, they don’t support a full ban on AI advancement, preferring progress to continue with requirements for safety testing (62%). Americans’ preference for safety regulations over the fastest possible progress holds even when they’re presented with the idea that regulating AI would put the U.S. behind China: Only 15% prefer a world where the U.S. government doesn’t regulate AI at all to compete with other countries like China over one where AI research continues under regulation, even if it develops slower than other countries (67%).\n\nEven in the most extreme case — presenting the choice between no further progress in AI at all and totally unregulated AI — only 34% would support unregulated AI development, versus 30% who think the government should ban research to improve AI, with a 36% plurality saying they’re unsure.\n\nIn terms of perceived dangers from AI, Americans’ biggest concern is AI taking jobs and causing unemployment (42%), followed by concerns about privacy (35%) and misinformation (33%). These are also the top three areas Americans prioritize for regulation. Respondents are not especially concerned about AI wiping out humanity (12%), but express greater concern about the use of AI resulting in loss of human control (32%).\n\nWhile respondents see AI as better than humans at being “efficient” by a wide margin (+44 points), AI has virtually no advantage on “being convenient to those they’re trying to help” (+2). Humans are still seen as wildly better in terms of being moral (+53), making complex decisions (+30), protecting privacy (+28), and being transparent (+18).\n\nWe also asked about the potential for replacing humans in specific governmental tasks, since this has been talked up by some AI proponents. There are only two specific tasks (from our list tested in this survey, at least) where AI is seen as better than human government employees. One is identifying trends in data (+18) and the other is correctly verifying the information in forms (+8).\n\nOn anything less concrete and data-focused, respondents strongly prefer humans. Human government employees are preferred over AI by 77 points for judging criminal trials, by 59 points for conducting airport screenings, and by 55 points for answering questions about government services like Social Security. Public interest in AI replacement of humans in government and other tasks is minimal.\n\nThis survey was run by Tavern Research via an online sample of 2,301 American adults fielded over web panels from August 1, 2025 to August 6, 2025. The margin of error is +/- 3%.\n\nNOTE: Because this is a web-based survey, we expect the total usage of AI to be slightly higher than the numbers found in non-web-based surveys. This should not affect the other conclusions.\n\nA question that was interesting, but didn’t lead to a larger conclusion, was asking what actually happens when you ask a tool like ChatGPT a question. 45% think it looks up an exact answer in a database, and 21% think it follows a script of prewritten responses.",

    "description": "Jon Rafman has been curating the images since 2008.",
    "fullText": "When Google Street View rolled out in 2007, it became the “world’s photographer.” Since then, artist Jon Rafman has been collecting moments captured by Google’s Street View cars.\n\nThe project is named Nine Eyes to reflect the nine cameras that are fitted to Street View cars. “Unlike traditional photography, these images have no author. The camera records everything but understands nothing,” says the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark, where Rafman is currently exhibiting his project.\n\nSince 2008, Rafman has been carefully selecting images from Street View, starting an archive taken from blogs and websites. He also joined the culture by finding pictures himself.\n\nRafman says that the cars with nine eyes are indifferent about what they photograph. But by curating them in this way, he develops the images in a way akin to how photographers used to develop photos in darkrooms.\n\n“There are the glitches in the technology that points to the artificiality of Street View, the happy accident of the error that creates something beautiful,” says Rafman. “There is also the more noir, hard-boiled street life scenes like the man with the gun, the prostitute, the drunks, all of the seedy underbelly. There is romantic imagery, the surreal, Jeff Wall-like images. There is ironic imagery, there’s the abject, there’s the beautiful, all the different poles of existence.”\n\nThe exhibition at the Louisiana is called Report a Concern, a nod to the message Google used to place in the corner of all its images. It is the first full presentation of the Nine Eyes archive, and as well as the images, it also features new AI-based pieces.\n\n“It explores how technology, surveillance, and memory shape our sense of reality in the digital age,” says the museum. “Nine Eyes invites the viewer to look again, not just at the world, but at the way technology sees it for us.’\n\nThe exhibit is at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebaek, Denmark, until January 11, 2026.",

    "description": "There has been an alarming spike in immigrants dying while in ICE detention during the Trump administration.",
    "fullText": "It’s official: December was the deadliest month for immigrants in ICE custody since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThis year was already the deadliest for those in ICE custody since 2004. In December, that trend continued, with seven immigrants dying in ICE detention, including four that died within a four day span, according to death notices published by ICE. Three of the deceased were held at facilities in Texas before they died. Four of the deceased died within four days of each other.\n\nFrancisco Gaspar-Andres, a 48-year-old man from Guatemala died on December 3, after being held at Camp East Montana in Texas since September. In his notice, ICE noted that although his “cause of death is pending, medical staff attributed it to natural liver and kidney failure.” The new detention facility at Fort Bliss has reportedly already violated dozens of federal standards for immigrant detention since welcoming detainees in August.\n\nPete Sumalo Montejo, a 72-year-old Filipino man who was previously convicted of child sexual abuse, died on December 5 at the Montgomery Processing Center in Texas. ICE reported that Montejo had suffered a number of illnesses throughout his time in custody: In June he was admitted for shortness of breath and hypoxia, and between July and November he was hospitalized several times for illnesses such as anemia and septic shock resulting from pneumonia.\n\nShiraz Fatehali Sachwani, a 48 year-old man from Pakistan, died on December 6, after being held at Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, since June. He was admitted to the hospital in November after experiencing low oxygen levels and tachycardia.\n\nJean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old Haitian man detained at Delaney Hall Detention Facility in Newark, New Jersey, died on December 12 from “suspected natural causes.” Immigrants held at Delaney Hall previously said that they were starved.\n\nFouad Saeed Abdulkadir, a 46-year-old Eritrean man, died in ICE custody December 14 at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania. Abdulkadir’s sudden death is reportedly the second to occur at that facility this year, and is currently being investigated by Pennsylvania State Police and the Clearfield County coroner.\n\nDelvin Francisco Rodriguez, a 39-year-old man from Nicaragua was pronounced dead on December 14, just one day after he was scheduled to be deported. He was discovered unresponsive and without a pulse at the Adams County Detention Center in Colorado on December 4, removed to a medical facility, and declared dead 10 days later.\n\nNenko Stanev Gantchev, a 56-year-old man from Bulgaria, died in ICE custody December 15 at the North Lake Processing Center in Michigan. While ICE wrote that they suspected he died of natural causes, his cause of death is under investigation.\n\nICE’s webpage dedicated to Detainee Death Reporting lists only 15 deaths in 2025—not including any from this month. However, at least 20 immigrants had already died in ICE custody as of October, according to NPR.\n\nICE is required to publish information about an in-custody death within 30 days.\n\nPresident Trump plans on ringing in the New Year by garnishing the wages of over 5 million student debtors currently in default on their loans, The Washington Post first reported.\n\nStarting January 7, the Department of Education plans to withhold a portion of the wages of around 1,000 defaulted borrowers. The number will gradually increase within the following months.\n\nNo, JD Vance will not be our first “Chad” president.\n\nThe vice president shared a series of photographs to X Monday showing himself valiantly running physical training drills with Navy Seals at Base Coronado, in California. Vance was photographed running down the beach, carrying a heavy log, climbing a large cargo net, and even rowing. Another set of photographs showed him speaking with officers, and posing for a photograph in front of a large American flag.\n\n“They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train,” Vance wrote on X, recapping his 90-minute PT session. “So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!” Vance previously served a four-year stint in the public affairs section in the 2nd Marine Aircraft.\n\nObviously, Vance’s critics were not impressed.\n\n“Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks,” Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist, wrote on X.\n\n“It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL,” Christopher Hale, a former Democratic congressional candidate, wrote on X.\n\nEven Vance couldn’t help but make fun of himself. He shared an edited version of the photograph that included his bloated, meme-ified face.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear what prompted Vance’s recent cosplaying adventure. Perhaps it has something to do with his recent presidential endorsement from Erika Kirk, a closely-held friend of the vice president. Or maybe it has something to do with his slipping poll numbers.\n\nA recent survey by AtlasIntel found that while Vance was still the leading pick to become the Republican nominee in 2028, a majority of Republicans no longer support him. Only 46.7 percent of respondents said they would pick Vance over other figures, down from 54.6 percent in a September poll.\n\nMeanwhile, a straw poll taken by Fox News at Turning Point USA’s Amerifest this past weekend found that 84.2 percent of respondents said they would like to see Vance as the Republican nominee in 2028, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis trailing far behind him. In order to claim the full support of MAGA, it seems Vance may have decided it’s time to prove himself more than a sniveling debate kid.\n\nThe Justice Department is now downplaying the Epstein files they took so long to release by claiming that they’re full of “untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump.”\n\n“The Department of Justice has officially released nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein,” the DOJ wrote Tuesday on X. “Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”\n\n“Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims.”\n\nWhile there certainly is some uncorroborated information in the files, there is also a wealth of new, possibly incriminating evidence about President Trump. One file contains an email from an assistant U.S. attorney from January 2020 that reads, “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than has previously been reported.”\n\nAnother file contained a 2019 letter from Epstein addressed to “L.N.” or Larry Nassar, the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of women and girls.\n\n“As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” Epstein wrote, appearing to reference his later death by suicide. “Good luck! We shared one thing… our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,” he said, signing off “J. Epstein.”\n\nEven as more information rolls in, it should come as no surprise that the Justice Department—which has been completely subservient to the president—continues to provide cover for him even as they release the heavily redacted files.\n\n“‘We’re releasing the documents, but please know in advance they’re fake, irrelevant, already debunked, totally harmless, and also important enough to issue a press statement about,’” one conservative X user posted. “If the DOJ tells you what to think before you read the documents, you already know they’re lying.”\n\nA bunch of masked male Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in tactical gear broke into the women’s bathroom of Cato nutrition bar factory in New York, even forcing a stall open while a woman in there used the toilet. They can be heard telling her to pull her pants up.\n\nICE agents illegally break into a woman's bathroom in a NY nutrition bar manufacturing plant. \"Pull up your pants,\" says a male agent. The agents only had a warrant to review employer documents. They didn't have a warrant to search for, detain, or arrest anyone there. pic.twitter.com/CnsGwkJzG4\n\nThe raid occurred in September, but the troubling footage was just recently revealed in court filings.\n\nThe officers justified their invasive actions by telling Cato’s owners that they had a warrant for a violent felon. In reality, the warrant they did have only allowed them to go into the building and seize documents, not kidnap a woman while she was on the toilet.\n\nICE eventually detained and questioned 57 people, even those who asked for a lawyer. At least 21 were deported and separated from their families.\n\n“I guess we found the men going into women’s bathrooms,” one X user mused.\n\nThe government found a photograph of Donald Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Steve Bannon’s phone. So, why did they redact it?\n\nBuried in the latest trove of documents released by the Department of Justice Monday, one email appeared to be from a federal investigator who said they’d discovered something while digging through Bannon’s iPhone 7.\n\n“As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon’s phone,” the email stated, passing it forward “in case it was of any importance” to someone handling “both cases.”\n\n“Thanks very much for flagging—no need to do anything on this one,” the person responds.\n\nDespite the fact that the Epstein Files Transparency Act only required the Trump administration to redact identifiable information of survivors—something that the government failed to do—the photograph of Trump and Maxwell was redacted in its entirety in the DOJ’s release. The sender and recipients’ names have also all been redacted.\n\nSo, what is it about this photograph in particular that warranted redaction?\n\nOver the course of his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump was photographed several times with Maxwell. The two attended parties and fashion events, and even traveled together.\n\nIt seems that Trump may be receiving some special treatment. In other photographs released as part of the government’s document dumps, former President Bill Clinton’s face remained visible while the faces of some other individuals were redacted. The DOJ even went so far as to release a statement to get ahead of the “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump contained in their own release.\n\nThe batch of files released Monday contained multiple disturbing revelations, including one email that suggested Trump flew on Epstein’s jet “many more times than previously has been reported,” and Epstein’s apparent suicide note that mentioned Trump’s love of “young, nubile girls.”\n\nEpstein files leaked on Monday night confirmed what so many people already suspected: President Trump spent much more time with Epstein—and young women—than he’s said he has.\n\nAn email from an assistant U.S. attorney from January 2020 reads, “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than has previously been reported.”\n\n“He is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was present,” the attorney continued, noting that Trump brought his wife, son Eric, and daughter Tiffany at times.\n\nOn one flight, the only three listed passengers were Trump,  Epstein, and a 20-year-old whose name has been redacted, likely a victim of Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nThis email completely undermines Trump’s various stories regarding his friendship with Epstein, from saying that he viewed Epstein as some kind of creep to be kept at arm’s length, to saying he barely knew him. Regardless of how their relationship ended, the president was flying around on a private jet with a sexual predator who abused children—which explains the lengths the administration went to keep these files from coming out even as a notable portion of their voter base recognized it as an issue.\n\nIt will be interesting to hear Trump and his helpers explain this one. Why would Trump fly on the sex trafficker’s plane multiple times? Did he just not know then too?\n\n“Trump was on Epstein’s plane, with Epstein victims,” one X user wrote. “Yet another reason why he was trying to keep the Epstein files from ever seeing the light of day.”\n\nWhat do Jeffrey Epstein, Larry Nassar, and Donald Trump all have in common?\n\nBuried in the latest trove of documents released by the Justice Department Monday, a postcard addressed to “L.N.” or Larry Nassar, the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of women and girls, mentioned Trump by name—and more.\n\n“As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” Epstein wrote in the alleged letter, appearing to reference his later death by suicide. “Good luck! We shared one thing… our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,” he continued, signing off “J. Epstein.”\n\nThe government also released an image of the envelope, which was addressed from Epstein to “inmate” Nassar, and was postmarked August 13, 2019, three days after Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York City. The letter, marked as return to sender, was addressed to Nassar at USP Arizona, where the high-profile pedophile had been held before he was transferred in 2018.\n\nLikely recognizing the harm that this letter’s authenticity would inflict on the president, the Department of Justice quickly announced \nTuesday morning that they would investigate its legitimacy. Less than two hours later they declared the FBI has concluded the note is a “FAKE”, citing the handwriting, postmark date, and an incorrect return address format for inmates. However, the DOJ did not choose to publish the results of the handwriting analysis originally obtained in July 2020, when establishing its authenticity would have been pertinent to a potential wrongful death suit based upon Epstein’s in-custody death.\n\nIt had previously been reported that Epstein attempted to reach out to Nassar, but that his letter had been returned. The government’s documents suggest that the letter was first discovered weeks later in September 2019, and was submitted for a handwriting analysis in July 2020. It’s not clear what the results of the writing test were.\n\nThe latest batch of documents released by the Department of Justice mention Trump’s name hundreds of times. One 2020 email sent by a federal prosecutor asserted that Trump had flown on Epstein’s private jet “many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).”\n\nThe previous batch of documents published Friday were heavily criticized for being incomplete. While the government made sweeping redactions to entire pages of documents, it apparently failed to redact the names of multiple survivors.\n\nJust days after plastering his name onto the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., President Trump will be naming a new class of battleships after himself.\n\nTrump is planning to make the naming announcement of the Navy’s new battleships alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Monday. An anonymous Pentagon official told The New York Times that Trump will call them “Trump-class” battleships.\n\nThe ship will be part of Trump’s vision of a new “Golden Fleet.” Each ship is expected to cost at least $5 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAs The New Republic’s Matt Ford wrote earlier this week—as bleak as the Gulf of America, the Trump Kennedy Center, the War Department, and others sound, Trump won’t be president forever. If he can change them just that easily, there’s no reason the next Democratic administration should hesitate to change them back.\n\nCBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss told 60 Minutes producers she was killing their story on the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador, where Trump deported more than 250 Venezuelan immigrants,  because it did “not present the administration’s argument.”\n\n“What we have is Karoline Leavitt’s soundbite claiming they are evildoers in America (rapists, murderers, etc.). But isn’t there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing?” Weiss wrote in a Sunday memo. “Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don’t tend to be shy. I realize we’ve emailed the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record.”\n\nWeiss’s decision to kill the story because it didn’t have enough perspective from DHS officials—who had already declined to speak with 60 Minutes—was met with uproar when it was leaked on Monday. But she doubled down.\n\n“We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera,” she said on a Monday staffing call, insinuating that the testimonies of CECOT inmates were insufficient.\n\nKilling a story about a brutal megaprison because the folks that are sending people to the brutal megaprison aren’t featured prominently enough has not been favorably received.\n\n“The Trump administration sent dozens [of] young men with no criminal record to be tortured and abused in a foreign prison,” podcaster Jon Favreau wrote. “@bariweiss can keep reporting, delaying, or kill the story altogether, but the basic facts have been well-documented in multiple court cases, including by Trump’s own DOJ and Trump-appointed judges.”\n\n“Bari Weiss’s main criticism is that 60 Minutes doesn’t advance the story,” writer Randye Hoder chimed. “But her solution is to ask Stephen Miller to regurgitate the same talking points this admin has given from the get-go, which we’ve heard a gazillion times)!”\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to comment. View the trailer for the scrapped segment here.\n\nHere's the deleted trailer for the now-\"delayed\" segment. It's almost impressive how much damage Bari Weiss has done to CBS News in such a short period of time. \n\nSomeone quickly schedule a prime-time Town Hall with Alan Dershowitz to rectify the harm:pic.twitter.com/382gRG5Lgp https://t.co/3gHRKNES2y",

    "description": "Photos show Greenland's culture, which has both Inuit and Danish influences. Its industry, cuisine, and more are shaped by the weather and history.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to acquire Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory.\n\nThe president resurfaced the issue this week by appointing Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana, as a special envoy to Greenland.\n\nTrump told the BBC that acquiring the island is necessary for \"national protection,\" adding, \"We have to have it.\"\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told TV2 that the appointment was \"completely unacceptable.\" Denmark said it will summon the US ambassador to explain.\n\nEarlier this year, US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, traveled to the island. Following criticism from Denmark and Greenlanders over the trip, the Vances' itinerary was amended so they only visited the US military base on Greenland, a change the Danish government called \"very positive.\"\n\nGreenland is known for its long, freezing winters, stunning glaciers, and fishing industry, but in many ways, it remains a frozen mystery to much of the world.\n\nPart of that mystique is because it's been difficult for some tourists to travel to, except by cruise ship or lengthy plane rides. A new international airport is making the country more accessible, including to US residents.\n\nMarianne A. Stenbaek, a professor of cultural studies at McGill University who studies Greenlandic art and literature, described Greenland as a \"modern society with a traditional touch.\" That's because Denmark colonized it hundreds of years ago, but aspects of its Inuit traditions remain.\n\nFrom its arts to its cuisine, Greenland has a culture all its own.\n\nThe country is a little bigger than Mexico. It's also much colder. About 80% of Greenland's 836,330 square miles are buried in snow and ice. An enormous national park, the world's largest, covers much of the northeast.\n\nThe island has long made it of interest to many other countries for military purposes and as a source of natural resources, from rare minerals to natural gas and oil.\n\nBut to Greenlanders, it's simply home.\n\nPre-Inuit groups, including members of the Saqqaq culture, came to the island around 2,500 BCE via Canada. They settled in northern, western, and southeastern Greenland. Today's Greenland Inuit population is descended from the Thule people, who moved into the country's north from Alaska through Canada around 1,000 years ago.\n\nBetween 985 and roughly 1450 CE, Vikings lived and then died out in Western Greenland. Erik the Red was the one who called the icy island Greenland. In Greenlandic, its name is Kalaallit Nunaat.\n\nDanish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede established a settlement in what's now Nuuk, Greenland's capital, in 1721. Over the centuries, Denmark's culture profoundly changed the country.\n\nGreenland remained a Danish colony until 1953 and became an autonomous territory in 1979. It has its own parliament, known as the Inatsisartut.\n\nWhile the country self-governs its domestic matters, Denmark retains jurisdiction over defense and foreign affairs.\n\nAround 56,000 people make Greenland their home.\n\nJust under 90% are Inuit, though most also have some European ancestry, according to genetic testing published by the American Society of Human Genetics in 2015. Danish people make up the rest of the population. Most live in coastal cities or communities.\n\nKalaallisut, also known as Greenlandic, is an Inuit language and is the official language of the country. It's widely spoken, though some groups in the east speak Tunumiit, according to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs.\n\nMost residents also speak Danish, which is taught as a second language in schools.\n\nThe population has long depended on fishing for their livelihoods. However, it's not enough to support the entire country. Denmark heavily supplements its budget with about $511 million annually, according to The BBC.\n\n\"The economy has been difficult,\" Stenbaek said. Tourism and the country's natural resources may be its future.\n\nWhether they're hoping to spot narwhals or want to glimpse glaciers, nature-loving tourists are drawn to Greenland.\n\nFor a long time, it was difficult to get to the island by plane. Nuuk only opened its international airport in November 2024. Before that, only a few airports had runways long enough to land large jets. But as of earlier this year, Americans can hop on a direct flight from New York to Nuuk.\n\nIlulissat, which has an ice fjord on UNESCO's World Heritage list, and Qaqortoq are also getting international airports, Reuters reported.\n\nTo get ready for the surge of tourists, some residents are buying snowmobiles to rent out, The New York Times reported. New hotels are opening, too.\n\nGreenland has a history of mining cryolite, which is used in aluminum smelting. A recent documentary, \"The White Gold of Greenland,\" claimed that for over 100 years, Danish mining companies extracted billions worth of the mineral, and Greenland reaped very little of the benefit, Variety reported.\n\nThat's not a history it would want to repeat if it taps its deposits of uranium, gold, natural gas, lithium, and other resources. While some see mining as an opportunity to enrich the country, others have concerns.\n\n\"Greenlanders are very hesitant about many aspects of mining because it impacts the nature so much,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nThere are also worries about how it could affect the fishing industry, while residents in Narsaq are concerned about their health if a company moves forward with mining radioactive uranium at a nearby proposed site, The Guardian reported.\n\nDanish culture is visible in Greenland's healthcare system, educational institutions, and government. \"To that extent, it has had a huge impact,\" Stenbaek said. At the same time, authorities contributed to the loss of many aspects of the Inuits' way of life.\n\nBetween the 1950s and '70s, the Danish government forced Inuit populations to relocate from smaller settlements and communities to cities, Reuters reported. During this time, doctors implanted IUDs in thousands of Inuit girls and women, sometimes without their consent, The BBC reported. Denmark is investigating the matter and has offered counseling to those affected, AP reported last year.\n\nMembers of the Inuit community were also pressured to give up their culture and language.\n\n\"We were told to act more Danish, to speak Danish, if we wanted to be something,\" Nadja Arnaaraq Kreutzmann, a Nuuk resident, recently told Reuters.\n\nFrom sewing national costumes to making jewelry to carving animal tusks, Inuit people in Greenland are finding ways to continue traditional practices.\n\n\"I'm concerned if we do not give the old traditions to younger people, it'll die out within 35 years,\" Greenlander Vera Mølgaard told National Geographic.\n\nQupanuk Olsen, a new member of Greenland's Parliament, has spent over five years gaining more than 320,000 Instagram followers by highlighting the country's food and traditions.\n\nSome estimates put Greenland's Lutheran population at 90%, heavily influenced by Hans Egede, the missionary who came to the island in 1721. His statue stands in Nuuk, and some want it removed, saying it's a symbol of the start of colonization, the AP reported.\n\nMany Greenlanders incorporate traditional religious practices into their services, Stenbaek said. They also sing hymns in Greenlandic, she said.\n\nThe city's architecture is Scandinavian, but its artwork incorporates Inuit tales, according to Lonely Planet. That duality is Nuuk in a nutshell.\n\n\"It's very much, in many ways, like a modern Scandinavian city,\" Stenbaek said. \"And at the same time, the Greenlandic culture, the traditional culture, is still there.\"\n\nThere are plenty of cafés, restaurants, and shopping for residents and tourists to visit.\n\nSmall settlements remain along the west and east coasts, Stenbaek said. Some have fewer than 100 people.\n\n\"They live very much like they would have lived 100 years ago,\" Stenbaek said. That means relying on fishing and other traditional knowledge to survive.\n\nIn the more remote areas of the country, it's not always easy to get from place to place.\n\n\"If you have to go from settlement to settlement, it's either by boat or dog sleigh or skiing,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nIf the water is too icy for boats, Greenlanders might have to jump in a helicopter. There are dog sled races in Uummannaq, but it's also a practical mode of transportation in the snowy weather. The same goes for snowmobiles.\n\nFar north regions experience polar nights in the winter, when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon. The opposite happens in the summer, when Greenland gets nonstop daylight for a couple of months.\n\nBoth are significant to Greenlanders.\n\nSince the sun is not visible in the winter, when spring comes it brings life back,\" photographer Inuuteq Storch told The Guardian in 2024. \"That time of total darkness is very spiritual.\"\n\nGreenland is a maritime culture, according to Stenbaek. \"Everything depends on ice and water,\" she said.\n\nIn some parts of the country, winters can last through April. The temperatures can be frigid, with some regions getting down to -30 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSummers in northern towns are still chilly, averaging around 41 degrees Fahrenheit, per The Guardian. Temperatures are getting warmer, though.\n\nPlenty of Greenlanders' pastimes involve braving the cold.\n\n\"Many of them are connected directly to nature, like fishing, hunting, skiing,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nThe snowy landscape and arctic waters surrounding the island are habitats for musk ox, reindeer, seals, polar bears, whales, and dozens of bird species.\n\nBerries, flowers, and cottongrass also grow in some parts of the country.\n\nSled dogs aren't just companions. They're often working animals, and have a long history of surviving alongside humans. Greenland's first dogs arrived with the Thule people hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe husky-like dogs have thick coats, muscular bodies for pulling sleds, and a digestive system suited to high-fat diets, as reported by Newsweek.\n\nSome dog sled races ban the use of other breeds, according to the Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nLong before there were grocery stores in Greenland, locals survived by hunting and fishing. Since the island doesn't have a lot of plant life, they got their vitamin C from whale skin, The New York Times reported.\n\nEven today, there isn't much farming in Greenland, though people do raise sheep in the south.\n\nWhile supermarkets sell imported food, like milk and vegetables, they'll also stock local fare, including fish, seal, and whale. Some Greenlanders also supplement their shopping by hunting reindeer, ox, and other animals.\n\n\"In Greenland, we have the world's wildest kitchen,\" chef Inunnguaq Hegelund recently told NPR.\n\nAs the planet heats up, Greenland has started to melt. Its glaciers are shrinking, and the permafrost is disappearing. In 2016, researchers found that the Greenland ice sheet was losing the equivalent of 110 million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water each year.\n\n\"It had an influence on roads and airports and houses when all of a sudden the earth starts to unfreeze,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nIt's started to change animals' migration patterns, and polar bears have had to adapt to a new way of hunting without sea ice.\n\nThe US National Science Foundation has been studying Greenland's ice sheet for decades.\n\nThe country's location also makes it the perfect location to obtain ice cores, test cold-weather engineering, monitor climate change, and study the elusive Greenland shark.\n\nOver the years, Greenland has become increasingly independent from Denmark. In 2008, it voted for a referendum granting them more autonomy. Many want to go even further and become completely independent from the Danish kingdom.\n\nAbout 80% of Greenlanders support the move, according to recent polling. Yet one longtime backer of the movement has recently become a bit more hesitant.\n\nAqqaluk Lynge is the former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, a nongovernmental organization representing Inuit people in several countries. He told NPR in February 2025 that he now supports Greenland staying tied to Denmark because \"if Greenland secedes from Denmark, it will be taken by United States.\"\n\n\"This is surprising because Aqqaluk used to be head of much of the independence movement,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to buy Greenland. In a speech to the US Congress earlier this year, he said that if Greenland chose to join, \"we welcome you into the United States of America.\"\n\nIt may be one of the reasons the Democratic party, which advocates for a slow approach to independence, won in recent elections, Stenbaek said. The majority of Greenlanders, 85%, according to a January 2025 opinion poll, don't want to become part of the US.\n\n\"Greenlanders want to remain Greenlandic,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nShe said she thought it was important for Greenland to strengthen connections with other countries, Canada in particular. They have a lot in common in terms of environmental concerns and large Inuit populations, she said.\n\n\"Both are Arctic countries,\" she said. \"They would be quite strong.\"",

    "fullText": "The third-quarter GDP report was a blowout, but don't expect that to change Mark Zandi's mind about how the economy is faring.\n\nAfter a long delay due to the government shutdown, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the latest economic growth data, and it was a lot more upbeat than economists were predicting.\n\nAccording to the Q3 report, the US economy is estimated to have expanded at a 4.3% growth rate during the three-month period, driven by robust consumer and federal spending.\n\nYet, Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, tells Business Insider that he's still harboring reservations about how things are going under the surface.\n\nZandi has been ringing the alarm on the economy all year, recently stating that he saw the US on the edge of a recession.\n\nThe most recent GDP report doesn't seem to have restored his confidence that better days are ahead.\n\n\"Despite the big gain in real GDP growth in the quarter, underlying real GDP growth — abstracting from the quarterly vagaries of the data — is closer to 2%,\" he told Business Insider. \"OK, but not great, and not strong enough to create enough jobs, as unemployment is steadily moving higher.\"\n\nZandi was predicting a 3.8% increase in real GDP growth, higher than most economists' estimates of 3.3%. As such, he isn't surprised by the numbers, although he also speculated that the big upside surprise may have been driven by technical quirks as opposed to actual momentum.\n\n\"The biggest difference with my forecast is the more substantial narrowing of the trade deficit, but this is due to the swings caused by the tariffs. Government spending was also stronger, but this is likely due to a measurement issue,\" he said.\n\nZandi believes that the government shutdown also increases the risk of revision for the Q3 report, with growth potentially being revised downward in the coming months.\n\n\"I can't explicitly connect the dots from the government shutdown, its impact on the government data, and on the GDP estimate,\" Zandi said, \"But it wouldn't be surprising if this data is ultimately revised to a significant degree.\"",

    "description": "AI transformation, workforce strategy, and new job roles are reshaping how companies like ServiceNow and Weber Shandwick operate today.",
    "fullText": "This article is part of the \"How AI is Changing Talent\" series, which explores how AI is reshaping hiring, development, and retention.\n\nTwelve months ago, Jacqui Canney was ServiceNow's chief people officer, focused on talent strategy. Today, she's also the company's chief AI enablement officer — a title that didn't exist until recently.\n\nThe two roles aren't separate, Canney told Business Insider. \"They're one strategy, and the companies that understand that are going to be the winners.\"\n\nThat shift, though, requires letting go of how most organizations have always structured work: by function, head count, and department. \"Companies can't treat this as 'We're going to run an AI program over here, and it'll add capacity,'\" she says.\n\nInstead, they need to ask: how does AI change the work across departments? \"AI doesn't follow the same silos people do. That's why you build the workforce around the new workflow.\"\n\nCanney's approach isn't an outlier. Rather, it's a signal of how quickly AI has become part of work and our daily lives.\n\nThree years after the launch of ChatGPT, adoption has reached 54.6%. That's staggering compared to adoption rates for personal computers (19.7%) and the internet (30.1%) three years after they were widely introduced, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nMeanwhile, about 21% of US workers say that at least some of their job is now done with AI, an increase from 16% roughly a year ago, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nAI is transforming everything about work, from the jobs people do to how they do them. Organizations, meanwhile, are racing to prepare their people for what comes next. While the long-term impact remains uncertain, early patterns are emerging about what's working and what isn't.\n\nAI's effect on the labor market is showing up everywhere: in how companies screen candidates, which skills command premium salaries, and how performance gets evaluated. Two structural shifts, in particular, stand out: new jobs are emerging, and old jobs are evolving.\n\nAn authoritative count of new AI-specific job titles is hard to come by, but data show rapid growth. A report from software company Autodesk found that demand for roles like AI engineer jumped 143.2% in 2024, while prompt engineer rose 135.8%, and AI content creator increased 134.5%. Meanwhile, the number of jobs requiring AI skills rose 7.5% last year, even as total job postings fell 11.3%, according to research from consultancy PwC.\n\nMolly Roenna, global chief people officer at PR firm Weber Shandwick, sees this firsthand. Her company is increasingly seeking specialists in areas like AI integration and AI ethics, and it's recruiting from disciplines like behavioral science and data analytics.\n\n\"We're hiring for a fundamentally different environment,\" Roenna says. \"Meeting client expectations requires people who use technology as a force multiplier for insight and creativity, not just a shortcut for efficiency.\"\n\nThe hiring process itself has evolved, too. Many of Weber Shandwick's interviews now include a \"technology conversation,\" a practice that appears to be gaining traction. This isn't to test technical skills, but to gauge how candidates use AI.\n\n\"What have they built with AI? What excites or worries them about it? We want perspective that comes from actual practice.\"\n\nThe dynamic playing out at Weber Shandwick and elsewhere isn't new. After all, every major technological advancement has created roles that were previously unimaginable, made others obsolete, and forced still others to adapt. What's different about this AI-driven era, however, is both the speed of change (see above) and the breadth, affecting workers across industries and skill levels.\n\n\"We didn't have programmers before computers,\" says Esteve Almirall Mezquita, professor of data, analytics, technology and AI at Esade in Madrid.\n\nCreating new roles and demand for expertise is half the equation. The bigger challenge is helping existing workers figure out how to use AI.\n\nSome companies aren't leaving that to chance. They're requiring it, notes Dan Schawbel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, a research firm. \"CEOs are under enormous pressure to have their AI story intact,\" he says. \"We have to have our workers using AI. It's good for productivity, yes, but also our story and bottom line.\"\n\nCompanies such as Microsoft, Coinbase, and Shopify now mandate AI use, according to previous reporting by Business Insider. Meta plans to measure employees' performance by their \"AI-driven impact.\"\n\nSchawbel predicts more scrutiny in the year ahead. Employees will need to function like data scientists, continuously proving their value, he says. \"Whether you're in marketing, IT, or HR, every action can be measured and tracked — and maybe even tied directly to your compensation.\"\n\nMeasuring AI use and seeing value from it are two different things, however. Even as organizations pour billions into the technology, results have been uneven.\n\nResearch by consulting firm BCG of more than 1,250 firms worldwide reports that 60% of companies are investing heavily in AI but seeing minimal returns. Meanwhile, only 5% have taken the step to restructure their operations around AI — and those companies are seeing significant revenue gains over everyone else.\n\nThe difference, the BCG research suggests, comes down to several factors. Successful companies have buy-in from the top and have redesigned how work gets done. Most importantly, says Alicia Pittman, BCG's global people chair, they've invested in teaching employees to use AI effectively.\n\nPittman notes that industries like financial services, insurance, and healthcare are pulling ahead in AI adoption. \"We're seeing companies put real time and energy into this in a way that hasn't been present before, and that's good for everybody and good for the global workforce.\"\n\nGranted, there's job displacement that comes with that and some skill sets will go away, she says. \"But helping people adapt to AI is a major investment in them as professionals.\"\n\nAt Moody's, the credit ratings firm, that investment involves encouraging employees to teach AI as much as possible.\n\nAri Lehavi, who runs applied AI there, says this approach frees employees to focus on complex work that requires human expertise.\n\nTake sales, for example. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems can capture basics like company size, contract history, and revenue potential. However, they miss what closes deals: company politics, individual motivations, and who really influences decisions. Lehavi's team teaches AI systems to learn those details so salespeople can concentrate on managing relationships.\n\n\"They can spend their time on things they're already doing but don't have enough time for,\" he says. \"The hard cases, the edge cases, the complex situations, mentoring other people, management, and skill development.\"\n\nIn other words: the human stuff.\n\nOf course, the path forward isn't simple or straightforward. Not every company has the resources to retrain its workforce, and some jobs will indeed disappear. Many companies are struggling to make AI work.\n\nYet, Canney of ServiceNow remains positive. \"It's a human renaissance,\" she says. \"You're going to have capacity in your workforce and the chance to guide it toward new revenue streams or creative ways of working. It's an enormous opportunity, and I'm definitely an optimist about it.\"",

    "fullText": "Gummy bears, ice cream, cookies, and martinis may sound like the makings of a holiday party, but they are among the expenses now at the center of a legal fight between JPMorgan Chase and convicted startup founder Charlie Javice.\n\nJavice was sentenced to seven years in prison earlier this year over fraud tied to Frank, the financial aid startup she sold to JPMorgan in 2021 for $175 million. Despite that conviction, JPMorgan has been ordered to pay the legal bills of its former executive.\n\nJPMorgan, which has already covered some $60 million in legal expenses for Javice, is now asking a Delaware Court of Chancery judge to relieve it of an additional $18 million in expenses.\n\nIt argued that Javice and her attorneys have abused the advancement system by running up excessive and improper legal expenses. Javice's lawyers have until January 5 to respond.\n\nOn Tuesday, Quinn Emanuel, which represents Javice in the Delaware case, pushed back, saying JPMorgan is \"trying to walk away from its contractual obligation to pay Ms. Javice's legal bills.\"\n\nThe bank is \"highlighting a handful of attorney expenses (not incurred by Ms. Javice) over two years, the vast majority of which it already reviewed and paid or are not disputed,\" Quinn Emanuel spokesman Eric Herman said.\n\nSee a list of some of the expenses JPMorgan has highlighted in its Delaware court filing:\n\nJPMorgan's Delaware chancery court filing complained that the bank was billed for \"copious amounts of alcohol\", including old fashioneds, Lychee martinis, and other \"specialty cocktails.\"\n\nThe filing claims some of the booze expenses were linked to \"a hotel bar and minibar.\"\n\nIt also complained of fees tied to \"ground transportation from one bar or restaurant to another in one evening.\"\n\nKolomon was an Austrian-influenced French restaurant located in Manhattan's Ace Hotel that closed in August 2025.

    "fullText": "Getting a new phone is a great way to start the new year, especially if it's one of Apple's latest iPhone models. But why get an upgrade for just yourself when you can upgrade the entire family in one go? T-Mobile's current holiday deal makes it worthwhile by handing out four free iPhone 17s when you open four new lines on its Essentials 4 Line Plan.\n\nT-Mobile's Essentials Plan is already one of the best cell phone plans we've ever tested for those looking to open multiple lines on a budget, so we highly recommend it at any time. But with four free iPhones to sweeten the deal, it's a particularly good time to switch.\n\nNot only does T-Mobile's current deal get you a suite of the most sophisticated iPhones yet for free, but it also gets you an excellent service plan. Compared to other major carriers like Verizon and AT&T, T-Mobile's phone plans offer the best value for their quality, especially if you're opening multiple lines, like in this promotion.\n\nFor more on plan offerings, coverage, and speeds, check out our full T-Mobile review.\n\nIt's worth noting that you won't be getting the four phones for free up front. You'll earn back the cost of the devices via 24 monthly billing credits, which means you'll be locked into a two-year contract with T-Mobile before the phones are officially paid off. You'll also have to pay a $35 activation fee for each device. Still, this is less of a commitment compared to other carriers, which typically lock you into a 36-month contract for this type of deal. It's certainly a small price to pay for upgrades for the whole family.\n\nIf you don't need a new phone, you can still upgrade to T-Mobile's network. The carrier is also running a promotion that gets new customers up to $800 back when they keep their current phone and switch to T-Mobile from another carrier. Learn \n\nThe terms and conditions can be hard to follow for these phone carrier deals, so we're breaking down exactly how to get your free phones. Here are the steps to follow.\n\nT-Mobile's four free iPhone 17s promotion isn't the only one the carrier is running ahead of the holidays. If you're on the hunt for a Samsung or Google smartphone, a different iPhone model, a smartwatch, or even a tablet, there's a deal for you. Explore some of T-Mobile's current promotions below.",

    "description": "In her new docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" 36-year-old Taylor Swift says she feels \"very depressed\" about pop culture's obsession with youth.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift didn't expect her career to get this big. Just ask Taylor Swift.\n\nIn the sixth and final episode of her new Disney+ docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" Swift reflects on the unprecedented success of the Eras Tour, which traversed 21 countries and grossed over $2 billion by the end of its two-year run.\n\n\"This tour will live on as probably the pinnacle, foremost, important thing that I've done,\" she tells the camera.\n\n\"I get very depressed about pop culture's obsession with youth culture,\" Swift continues. \"We designate extremely young people to be the ones who have to tell us where culture is going, and the idea that an artist had, in my case, the privilege of developing — to the point where you're in your 30s and you know yourself a bit more, and then you were able to make the thing that they'll know you for. There's something very special about that.\"\n\nSwift was days away from turning 35 when the Eras Tour concluded on December 8, 2024 — the same age that Swift once believed would be her ceiling as a pop star.\n\nThe 2019 Netflix documentary, \"Miss Americana,\" focused on the creation and rollout of Swift's seventh album, \"Lover,\" which was released when she was 29. In one particularly memorable scene, Swift discusses her age in relation to her stardom.\n\n\"It's a lot to process because we do exist in this society where women in entertainment are discarded in an elephant graveyard by the time they're 35,\" she says. \"Everyone's a shiny new toy for like, two years. The female artists that I know of have reinvented themselves 20 times more than the male artists. They have to. Or else you're out of a job.\"\n\n\"This is probably one of my last opportunities as an artist to grasp onto that kind of success,\" she continues. \"As I'm reaching 30, I'm like, I wanna work really hard while society is still tolerating me being successful.\"\n\nSwift helped popularize the idea of albums as \"eras,\" a concept that describes the synergy between songs, music videos, outfits, performances, and marketing choices to curate an immersive experience for fans.\n\nSwift has continued to use this strategy well after \"Lover,\" adopting new aesthetics and alter-egos for albums like \"Folklore\" (2020), \"Midnights\" (2022), and \"The Tortured Poets Department\" (2024).\n\nWith the Eras Tour, Swift tried something different: Rewinding the clock. Each segment of the set list was framed around a different album from Swift's catalog, dating back to her 2008 sophomore release, \"Fearless.\" The segments were each embellished with distinctive costumes that recalled what Swift wore at the time of the album's release.\n\nSwift designed the tour to celebrate her past as much as her present, a significant shift from her mindset expressed in \"Miss Americana,\" when she described her job as \"constantly finding new facets of yourself that people find to be shiny.\"\n\nSwift's fans welcomed her nostalgic turn with open arms, packing stadiums worldwide to watch her perform three-plus hours of songs, some of which were over a decade old. According to the singer's production company, Taylor Swift Touring, over 10 million people attended the Eras Tour.\n\nSwift's latest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" was largely written and recorded during the European leg of the tour in 2024. In episode five of \"The End of an Era,\" Swift says the album's sound was inspired by the feeling of the tour itself: \"so romantic, and magical, and passionate,\" and \"full of possibility.\"\n\nFull of possibility, indeed. \"Showgirl\" sold over 4 million copies in its debut week — the biggest album sales week of all time. Through the rest of the year (and through Swift's 36th birthday), it has continued to dominate the Billboard 200.\n\nTo say that society is still tolerating Swift's success would be quite an understatement — a fact that would've likely stunned Swift in her late 20s.\n\n\"This was a seismic, momentous period of time in my life, and in the lives of the performers and the crew members and anyone who this tour touched,\" Swift says of the Eras Tour in her docuseries. \"It's never gonna happen again this way.\" Still, knowing Swift, surpassing former standards of success is never out of the question.",

    "title": "What Is VO2max?",
    "description": "It measures your cardio fitness, but it's not as important as tech companies want you to think.",
    "fullText": "The more you work out, the fitter you'll get. Your VO2max, sometimes described on wearables as a \"cardio fitness\" score, is a number that tends to be higher among people who are more cardiovascularly fit. But it's not the only measure of fitness, and you should know what it really means.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers don't actually measure VO2max; they just estimate it. To actually find your VO2max, you'd need to go to an exercise lab and do a test on a treadmill or cycle while hooked up to equipment that measures your heart rate and the air you're exhaling. I did exactly this kind of test to compare my real VO2max to the numbers reported by nine different devices. You can read about my experience, and why it matters, here.\n\nVO2max, properly rendered VO2max, is the maximal volume (V) of oxygen (O2) your body can use per minute during exercise, scaled to your body size because larger people will naturally use more oxygen. This is considered a good measure of aerobic fitness because—think back to high school biology—your body uses oxygen and food to create a usable form of chemical energy called ATP. You then use that ATP to power the movements of your muscles. The amount of oxygen directly correlates with the amount of energy produced. Or, in simpler terms, the more work you do, the more oxygen you need.\n\nSo a person who is aerobically very fit—let’s say an elite marathon runner—can do more work (run faster) than somebody who isn’t. As a result, they’ll suck in a lot more oxygen per minute during their run than, say, I would.\n\nA typical sorta-fit human being will have a VO2max somewhere in the 30s or 40s. If you exercise a lot, you can push that number higher. Elite cyclists, skiers, and ultrarunners may have numbers in the 70s or 80s, and a few people out there have scored in the 90s. I'd call myself a recreational athlete (I run a little) and my lab-tested VO2max was 43. Most of my fitness wearables reported numbers for me in the high 30's or low 40's—a good reminder that these estimates can be useful, but they aren't necessarily correct.\n\nTo be able to use a large amount of oxygen, you need more than just good lungs. You also need a strong heart and healthy circulatory system to get the oxygen to your muscles. And you need muscles that are large and can do a lot of work per minute—which means that you're strong and can do a lot of work athletically. VO2max is a way to summarize a lot of important things about cardio fitness into one simple number.\n\nBut it’s important to know that this number isn’t everything about fitness, or even aerobic fitness. First, it doesn’t make much sense to compare your VO2max to other people’s, because it’s affected by factors like blood volume and muscle mass. Men tend to have a VO2max about ten points higher than similarly fit women, for example. There are also plenty of aspects of fitness that aren't captured by VO2max. Compare two athletes with the same VO2max, and you may find that one can keep going in an endurance race longer than the other. Or one might be better at sprinting while another is better at medium-effort work. One person may be stronger than another, or have better technique, or be more resistant to injuries.\n\nThere is research correlating VO2max with longevity, but that doesn't mean that raising your VO2max a few points will add years to your life. Fitness, in general, tends to correlate with longevity and with overall health. Scientists who want to study that relationship will usually pick an easy thing or two to measure, like VO2max or grip strength. But in real life, we don't have to choose one number to maximize; we can work on multiple aspects of fitness. It's better to be well-rounded than to hyperfocus on just one metric.\n\nThe gold standard is a lab test. High-level athletes will sometimes take this test if they or their coach want to know their actual, definite VO2max number. But we can measure aerobic fitness in other ways, and there are workouts you can do to get a good estimate of VO2max. If you’re a runner, you can look up a recent race time on this chart to find your VDOT, which roughly correlates with your VO2max. (My best-ever mile time gets me a VDOT of 38, for example.)\n\nTo estimate your VO2max from a workout, you need something that will take you to your absolute maximum aerobic output. A race does this job nicely; so will a test like running as many laps of a track as you can in 12 minutes. I recall doing a test in a Phys Ed. class once where we had to step up and down from a high box as many times as possible. These tests aren’t pleasant, but their results can be a benchmark to tell you whether you’re improving your fitness over time.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers typically estimate VO2max by comparing your heart rate during exercise to a measure of how much work you're doing during that exercise. Most often, this is through outdoor running or walking. The speed you run or walk is measured through GPS, and the device compares that to your heart rate. If you can run fast with a low heart rate, you must be pretty fit and your VO2max will be estimated as being pretty high. If your heart rate is high even for a slow running or walking pace, your VO2max is lower.\n\nThese estimates aren't always accurate. If your max heart rate isn't set properly in the device's settings, if it's hot out, if your running route has hills, or if you don't happen to get out for outdoor runs or walks very often, your VO2max is more likely to be wrong. That said, your VO2max estimate doesn't have to be exactly correct to be useful. If the number increases over time, you're probably getting fitter. And if it decreases, you're likely losing fitness.",

    "fullText": "The makers of Bevel, a health app for the Apple Watch that turns the device into a Whoop-style fitness tracker, have announced on social media that nearly all of the app’s functions will soon be available for free. Until now, Bevel required a $5.99/month (or $49.99/year) subscription. That said, the paid tier isn't going away completely.\n\nYou can read my review of Bevel here, but in brief, it’s a tracking app that uses data from your Apple Watch (and other devices) to give you a Whoop-style dashboard that collects your health data in one place and analyzes it. Bevel can give you advice about how recovered it thinks you are, and how your habits affect your health metrics. While the Apple Watch can collect a lot of data, Apple has never built an app that integrates everything in a friendly, easily readable way.\n\nThat integrated dashboard is where Apple Watch competitors like Whoop and Oura shine, and using Bevel (or one of its competitors, like Athlytic) gives a similar experience.\n\nAccording to announcements Bevel made on Instagram and Reddit, an update rolling out this week makes all features of Bevel free except Bevel Intelligence, their AI feature. The company says this is because AI is more expensive for it to provide. Free features include everything else: “all historical data, Nutrition, Strength Builder, Sleep Alarm, and much more.”\n\nThe company also hinted that two things are likely coming in 2026: more features (specifics not yet announced) and a price hike. Customers who currently \n\nThere’s not enough information to know whether next year’s plans, which the company is calling “Bevel 3.0,” will be worth the subscription fee, whatever it happens to be. But I can say that the features of regular Bevel are definitely worth a try, especially at no cost. Bevel collects data from almost any health app that links to Apple Health, and can track a multitude of metrics, including strength training by muscle group, cardio load, recovery scores, and habit tracking. Most other wearables collect this information in their own apps, but if you wear an Apple Watch, Bevel is one of the best ways to consolidate it all.",

    "description": "This year saw new AI models, transformative products and new breakthroughs in science and robotics.",
    "fullText": "This was a year of AI agents, reasoning and scientific discovery.\n\n2025 has been a year of extraordinary progress in research. With artificial intelligence, we can see its trajectory shifting from a tool to a utility: from something people use to something they can put to work. If 2024 was about laying the multimodal foundations for this era, 2025 was the year AI began to really think, act and explore the world alongside us. With quantum computing, we made progress towards real-world applications. And across the board, we helped turn research into reality, with more capable and useful products and tools making a positive impact on people's lives today.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the breakthroughs, products and scientific milestones that defined the work of Google, Google DeepMind and Google Research in a year of relentless progress.\n\nThis year, we significantly advanced our model capabilities with breakthroughs on reasoning, multimodal understanding, model efficiency, and generative capabilities, beginning with the release of Gemini 2.5 in March and culminating in the November launch of Gemini 3 and the December launch of Gemini 3 Flash.\n\nBuilt on a foundation of state-of-the-art reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro is our most powerful model to date, designed to help you bring any idea to life. It topped the LMArena Leaderboard and redefined multimodal reasoning with breakthrough scores on benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam — a fiendishly hard test for AI models to see if AI can truly think and reason like humans — and GPQA Diamond. It also set a new standard for frontier models in mathematics, achieving a new state-of-the-art of 23.4% on MathArena Apex. We followed shortly with Gemini 3 Flash, which combines Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost, making it the most performant model for its size. Gemini 3 Flash's quality surpasses our previous Gemini 2.5 Pro-scale model's capabilities at a fraction of the price and substantially better latency, continuing our Gemini-era trend of 'the next generation's Flash model is better than the previous generation's Pro model'.\n\nLearn more about our progress on our world-class AI models this year:\n\nGemini 3 Flash price & benchmark table.\n\nWe’re committed to making useful AI technology accessible, with state-of-the-art open models. We built our Gemma family of models to be lightweight and open for public use; this year we were able to introduce multimodal capabilities, significantly increase the context window, expand multilingual capabilities, and improve efficiency and performance.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances in Gemma models:\n\nThroughout 2025, we continued to advance the trajectory of AI from tool to utility, transforming our portfolio of products with new, powerful agentic capabilities. We reimagined software development by moving beyond tools that assist coding to introducing powerful, agentic systems that collaborate with developers. Key advances, such as the impressive coding capabilities in Gemini 3 and the launch of Google Antigravity, mark a new era in AI-assisted software development.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances building developer tools:\n\nThis evolution was also clear across our core products, from AI-enabled features on the Pixel 10 and updates to AI Mode in Search, to AI-first innovations like the Gemini app and NotebookLM, which gained advanced features like Deep Research.\n\nLearn more about how we’ve transformed our products with AI:\n\n2025 was a transformative year for generative media, giving people new and unprecedented capabilities to realize their creative ambitions. Generative media models and tools for video, images, audio and worlds became more effective and broadly used, with breakouts Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro offering unprecedented capabilities for native image generation and editing. We worked with people in creative industries to develop tools like Flow and Music AI Sandbox, making them more helpful for creative workflows, and we expanded creative possibilities for people with new, AI-powered experiences in the Google Arts & Culture lab, major upgrades to image editing within the Gemini app, and the introduction of powerful new generative media models like Veo 3.1, Imagen 4 and Flow.\n\nLearn more about how we’re building AI to enhance creativity:\n\nAs research breakthroughs continue to expand AI’s capabilities, Google Labs is where we share AI experiments as we develop them – hearing from users and evolving as we learn. Some of this year’s most engaging experiments from Labs: Pomelli, an AI experiment for on-brand marketing content; Stitch, which introduced a way to turn prompt and image inputs into complex UI designs and frontend code in minutes; Jules, an asynchronous coding agent that acts as a collaborative partner for developers; and Google Beam, a 3D video communications platform that used AI to advance the possibilities of remote presence.\n\nLearn more about how we’re experimenting in Labs:\n\n2025 was also a banner year for scientific advances with AI, marked by breakthroughs in life sciences, health, natural sciences, and mathematics.\n\nIn the space of a year, we made progress in building AI resources and tools that empower researchers and help them understand, identify, and develop treatments in healthcare. In genomics, where we’ve been applying advanced technology to research for 10 years, we moved beyond sequencing, using AI to interpret the most complex data. We also marked the 5-year anniversary of AlphaFold, the Nobel-winning AI system that solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem. AlphaFold has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to advance life sciences and health:\n\nGemini’s advanced thinking capabilities, including Deep Think, also enabled historic progress in mathematics and coding. Deep Think was able to solve problems that require deep abstract reasoning – achieving gold medal-standard in two international contests.\n\nLearn more about how we’re advancing natural sciences and mathematics:\n\nWe’re also leading major discoveries and shaping the future of science in areas like quantum computing, energy and moonshots. Research in this area drew new levels of public attention, with progress towards real-world applications of quantum computing as demonstrated by Quantum Echoes and, notably, Googler Michel Devoret becoming a 2025 Physics Nobel Laureate along with former Googler John Martinis and UC Berkeley’s John Clarke, for their foundational 1980s quantum research.\n\nLearn more about our work on space infrastructure and quantum computing:\n\nIn 2025, we continued to advance the core infrastructure that powers our AI, focusing on breakthroughs in hardware design and improving energy efficiency. This included the introduction of Ironwood, a new TPU built for the age of inference, which was designed using a method called AlphaChip, alongside a commitment to measuring the environmental impact of our technology.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to develop chips, infrastructure and improve energy efficiency:\n\nOur work in robotics and visual understanding brought AI agents into both the physical and virtual worlds, with advancements like the foundational Gemini Robotics models, the more sophisticated Gemini Robotics 1.5, and the introduction of Genie 3 as a new frontier for general-purpose world models.\n\nLearn more about our work with world models and robotics:\n\nOur work throughout 2025 demonstrates how AI-enabled scientific progress is being directly applied to address the world's most critical and pervasive challenges. By leveraging state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning, we are significantly increasing our understanding of the planet and its systems, while also delivering impactful solutions in areas vital to human flourishing, including climate resilience, public health and education.\n\nFor example, we are using state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning to help increase our understanding of the planet, helping enable work that is making a difference in people’s lives now from weather predictions to urban planning to public health. For example, our flood forecasting information now covers more than two billion people in 150 countries for severe riverine floods. And our most advanced and efficient forecasting model, WeatherNext 2 can generate forecasts 8x faster and with resolution up to 1-hour. Using this technology, we’ve supported weather agencies in making decisions based on a range of scenarios through our experimental cyclone predictions.\n\nLearn more about our work in weather, mapping and wildfires:\n\nWe are working with partners to apply AI-enabled scientific progress closer to patients, opening up new avenues for disease management and therapeutic discovery.\n\nLearn more about our health-related work:\n\nAI is proving to be a powerful tool in education, enabling new forms of understanding and expanding curiosity through initiatives like LearnLM and Guided Learning in Gemini. We brought Gemini’s most powerful translation capabilities to Google Translate, enabling much smarter, more natural and accurate translations and piloting new speech to speech translation capabilities.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to enable learning:\n\nWe couple our research breakthroughs with rigorous and forward-looking work on responsibility and safety. As our models grow more capable, we’re continuing to advance and evolve our tools, resources and safety frameworks to anticipate and mitigate risk. Gemini 3 demonstrated this approach in action: it's our most secure model yet, and has undergone the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date. And we’re looking further ahead, exploring a responsible path to AGI, prioritizing readiness, proactive risk assessment, and collaboration with the wider AI community.\n\nLearn more about our responsibility and safety work:\n\nAdvancing the frontier of AI responsibly demands collaboration across all parts of society. In 2025, we worked with leading AI labs to help to form the Agentic AI Foundation and support open standards to ensure a responsible and interoperable future for agentic AI. In education, we’ve partnered with school districts like Miami Dade County and education groups like Raspberry Pi to equip students with AI skills. Our research partnerships with universities like UC Berkeley, Yale, the University of Chicago and many more have been instrumental to some of this year’s most exciting frontier research, and we’re working with the US Department of Energy’s 17 national laboratories to transform how scientific research is conducted. And we’re working with filmmakers and other creative visionaries to put the best AI tools in their hands and explore storytelling in the age of AI.\n\nLearn more about our work on frontier collaboration:\n\nAs we look towards 2026, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance the frontier, safely and responsibly, for the benefit of humanity.",

    "description": "Plug Power and Lucid could both be zeros.",
    "fullText": "Plug Power and Lucid both have negative gross margins and are burning through cash.\n\nPlug Power has a history of underdelivering.\n\nLucid's cash outflows this year will be extreme when compared to its market cap.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Plug Power ›\n\nIf you're betting big on Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) or Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID), you should probably think again. These are the type of stocks that could easily wipe away a $100,000 nest egg in the blink of an eye. Both companies have the strong potential to go bankrupt in the coming years, with the stocks going to zero.\n\nLet's take a close look at both stocks.\n\nPlug Power fancies itself as the next next-generation hydrogen fuel cell company, but its core business is actually providing fuel cells that go into forklifts and other material handling equipment. Fuel cell-powered forklifts are popular in high-volume warehouses and fulfillment centers that run 24/7, as operators just have to refuel the fuel cell and not recharge a battery. Meanwhile, the industry has moved away from gasoline-powered forklifts due to safety issues using them in an enclosed building.\n\nThis would seem to be a good business, but it has not been for Plug Power. The company also provides the hydrogen fuel to its customers, which it has long sold at a loss. To make matters worse, it has also been selling its equipment and infrastructure at a loss as well.\n\nTo try and change what is an uneconomical business model, Plug Power is in the process of building out a system of hydrogen plants to produce its own hydrogen to be able to sell at a profit. It's also undergoing a restructuring program and has looked to raise prices. However, thus far, the company is still producing negative gross margins and has both massive negative operating cash flow and free cash flow.\n\nWhile the company has pledged to get to break-even gross margins by next year, that would still not solve all its problems. Meanwhile, the company has a long history of not delivering on its projections.\n\nLucid's stock recently hit an all-time low, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have further to fall. Like Plug Power, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has negative gross margins and is bleeding cash. Just last quarter, it burnt through more than $950 million in cash, and it's gone through more than $2.5 billion in cash so far this year. Notably, the company's market cap is only around $3.7 billion, so this is extreme.\n\nLucid is betting big on its entry into the luxury EV SUV market with its Gravity model, which it thinks will complement its luxury sedan, Lucid Air. It's also looking to launch a cheaper midsize platform. However, the company isn't seeing the gross margin step-change that rival Rivian has seen when it switched to a zonal architecture that significantly reduced costs.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin woman who almost killed her sixth-grade classmate to please the fictional horror villain known as Slender Man was ordered back to a state psychiatric hospital Tuesday after she escaped from her group home last month.\n\nWaukesha County Circuit Judge K. Scott Wagner granted a state Department of Health Services request to revoke 23-year-old Morgan Geyser’s release privileges. Geyser told the judge through her attorney, Tony Cotton, last week that she would not fight revocation. Wagner then approved the request during a short hearing.\n\nCotton didn't immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.\n\nGeyser and her friend Anissa Weier lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a Waukesha park in 2014. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier cheered her on. A passing bicyclist discovered Leutner, who barely survived. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.\n\nGeyser and Weier later told investigators they attacked Leutner in hopes of impressing Slender Man enough that he would make them his servants and wouldn't hurt their families. Both of them were eventually committed to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute — Geyser for 40 years and Weier for 25 years.\n\nWeier earned conditional release in 2021. Wagner granted Geyser conditional release this past September despite warnings from state Department of Health Services officials that she couldn't be trusted.\n\nGeyser was placed in a Madison group home. Authorities say that on Nov. 22 she cut off her GPS monitor and fled the state with a 43-year-old companion. Police arrested both of them the next day at a truck stop outside Chicago, about 170 miles (274 kilometers) south of Madison.\n\nGeyser's companion told WKOW-TV that the two of them became friends at church and had been seeing each other daily for the last month. Geyser decided to escape because she was afraid the group home would no longer allow them to see each other, the companion said.\n\nSlender Man was created online by Eric Knudsen in 2009 as a mysterious figure photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He grew into a popular boogeyman, appearing in video games, online stories and a 2018 movie.",

The one thing they have in common is that a dedicated team of people worked on it without any assistance from GenAI tools.\n\nIt’s important to clarify that any procedural generation of maps, or randomized abilities or enemies, uses AI to determine what appears, and is not the same as GenAI. We’re specifically excluding games that use AI to generate any assets, whether it’s disclosed at the point of sale or found out after publishing. If it’s ethically problematic for any of these reasons, a game won’t be included on the list, no matter how much of a Game of the Year contender it is. With that, here are the best games without AI involvement in their development.\n\nHades 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Supergiant Games’ Game of the Year, which puts you in the shoes of the immortal Princess Melinoë as she attempts to save her father Hades and his kingdom from the time-looping clutches of the Titan Cronos. It largely follows a similar Roguelike structure, where each run has you collect powers from the Ancient Greek Pantheon to augment your chosen weapon and crush the foes in your way.\n\nOf course, with every sequel, you need to outdo what came before. Naturally, this means having two separate paths from the beginning, each with its own layout. One leads to the depths of Hades to Cronos, while the other has Melinoë ascend to the peak of Mt Olympus to defeat the invading monsters. Fans of the first will likely already have this one, but you don’t need to have mastered the original to enjoy everything that Hades 2 has to offer.\n\nReleased episodically, Dispatch is a wonderful throwback from the team behind The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. Throughout its first season, you are a former superhero, Mechaman, who becomes a dispatcher for a new generation of heroes. However, he ends up managing a team of miscreants who are easily sidetracked by a little bit of arson or petty theft. It’s up to you to keep everything on track, even when things go south.\n\nWhether it’s allocating the right person for a particular job or making sure another hero doesn’t get sidetracked, each chapter has significant decisions that drastically change the outcome of a mission. By reading each hero's bio and upgrading their skills, you’ll increase your chances of success. You’ll also occasionally need to hack into systems remotely to assist your heroes when they’re in peril.\n\nDispatch’s stunning cast, which includes professional voice actors and some YouTubers branching out and doing a decent job in bringing these larger-than-life characters to life. By the time you reach the end, only one question will likely be on your mind: when’s season 2?\n\nFor fans of retro beat-'em-ups such as Streets of Rage or Final Fight, it’s been quite a while since a brand-new series broke ground. Absolum carefully blends in Roguelike game mechanics to make what Steve Watts, in his review, described as “a match made in heaven”. You play as one of a band of rebel wizards led by Root Mother Uchawi, a benevolent god-like being, who attempts to take on the tyrant Sun King Azra and his Crimson Order army, who have taken over the world of Talamh.\n\nWith multiple characters to play with their own fighting style, a phenomenal soundtrack, stunning visuals, and a Hades-like elemental progression system for every run, it’s easy to see how this is a winning formula. On top of that, there are plenty of branching paths and hidden secrets to find along the way. Quests ask you to venture to specific points, but don’t always require that you reach them in the same run.\n\nSome may feel that the Roguelike structure holds it back because it doesn’t lean into it enough, but it instead asks for the player to master its mechanics by giving them familiar challenges, and as such, may be somewhat fairer to their time. If you’re not convinced, there’s a free Absolum demo you can check out that gives you a small slice of just how wonderfully everything comes together, and like the full-price experience, you can bring a friend with you in your quest to save the realm.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nSolving the mystery behind a weird house with constantly shifting layouts that you inherited was not exactly on our bingo card for 2025, but Blue Prince is one of the best puzzle games we’ve played in years. Each day, you have a set number of steps to explore a house with randomized rooms. These rooms can give or take away steps, grant you items, or even house escape room-like puzzles that reward you with more trinkets.\n\nOn top of this, Blue Prince has a rather intricate mystery throughout. Clues hidden in certain rooms will allude to the house itself, including what’s in room 46, the former owner Herbert S. Sinclair, and a children's author called Marion Marigold. It might take you only a few attempts, or it may take you many. If you find you’re struggling to make a dent, you should check out our Blue Prince guides hub for some tips. Persevere, and you’ll find out why it’s worth continuing until you find that fated room.\n\nNintendo’s big ape smashes his way onto the Switch 2 with Donkey Kong Bananza, from the creators of Super Mario Odyssey. Our gorilla hero travels to Ingot Isle to mine Banadium Gems, only to have his hoard stolen by a sinister simian syndicate known as VoidCo. Buried deep underground, DK soon finds an odd sentient rock that later turns out to be a younger version of Pauline. The two team up to excavate through each layer of this underground world to stop VoidCo.’s president from reaching the planet’s core.\n\nThe big selling point of Donkey Kong Bananza is that DK can dig his way through levels with his bare hands, uncovering secrets while using rocks and soil to bash his way to the end. Pauline’s singing also helps unlock transformations that enable DK to fly or charge at high speed, amongst others. Much like 3D Mario games and their equivalent macguffins, you’ll also gather crystal bananas for completing objectives. However, these bananas also tie in with the upgrade system that unlocks more powers for the duo.\n\nWhat sets it apart is that, despite being vastly different from every other Donkey Kong game, it manages to pay homage to the series. Cameos from DK’s animal friends, musical homages, and so much more. It’s one of the few essential games to own for the Nintendo Switch 2 in its first year on the market. In case you’re wondering, you can safely skip the DLC: DK Island and Emerald Rush unless it’s put on sale, or you really enjoy Roguelike modes.\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is a remaster made with love, care, and passion. Since the source code was lost, as was sadly the norm back in the 1990s, the effort made to bring the entire campaign to currently available platforms is staggering. It does have the newer translation, added voice acting, and support for higher resolutions than its PlayStation, PSP, or mobile iterations, and all of that is created or performed by talented people. And yet, despite the modern additions, it’s still the same punishing, yet charming, and above all, epic classic RPG from Square Enix’s golden age.\n\nIt would have been so easy just to churn out a ‘modern reskin’ of the classic permadeath game, or mangle its existing assets with generative AI upscaling tools. However, the team behind Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles evidently cared, wanting to retell the War of the Lions saga that captivated many with its twists and turns. Rebalancing encounters and adding the ability to skip non-story fights help ease newer players in, allowing them to experience some of what makes this tactical RPG so special.\n\nPeak is high up there when it comes to games with humble origins. It started as a Game Jam experiment that people loved so much that it inspired the developers, whose previous effort was the crustacean Soulslike game, Another Crab’s Treasure, to expand it into a full multiplayer experience. It’s one of the best Steam co-op games of the year, and that’s largely thanks to its tense gameplay and proximity-based voice chat.\n\nAs you ascend the biomes, you’ll encounter many dangerous obstacles such as toxic plants, chilling winds, and lava that rises and falls. Sometimes, you have mere seconds to cross perilous gaps, and sometimes it’s unclear if your constantly fatiguing scout can even make it until you try. Every major update adds a new environment filled with hazards, and new items make every run an unpredictable challenge.\n\nPlaying it with friends lets you share tools and food across your backpacks, and even grab a partner’s hand to reach the ledge they’re on. Once you’ve reached the top of the final level, you can begin tweaking runs with difficulty modifiers, which gives Peak a great amount of replay value. Whatever you do, though, don’t let the Scoutmaster see you if you split from the party.\n\nAs the name would suggest, Silent Hill f is not for the faint of heart. The latest in the horror game series takes place in the fictional town of Ebisugaoka in 1960s Japan, where the protagonist Hinako Shimizu finds her homeland shrouded in fog and infested with grotesque monsters intent on killing her and her childhood friends. It soon becomes apparent that all is not quite as it seems, as Hinako discovers an alternate dimension where she encounters a guide wearing a fox mask.\n\nTo survive, you’ll need to find and maintain gathered weapons while mastering both the focus attack and the timing of dodging enemy strikes. You’ll also solve puzzles with cryptic clues, all while the Silent Hill f tries its hardest to unsettle you. An early part taking place in a paddy field is particularly memorable, and it’s not even the game’s evilest trick.\n\nSilent Hill continues the series’ track record of weaving a tale within its enemy design, the documents and letters you find, and even item descriptions. All of which provide intricate clues as to what’s really happening. Some will probably find that one playthrough is enough for them, but persevere with subsequent playthroughs, and you’ll soon uncover more layers that need unravelling to get the next ending.\n\nFrom the people who brought you Before Your Eyes comes Goodnight Universe, a game with a great story where you interact telepathically with your surroundings as a 6-month-old baby. Having gained sentience moments before your grandfather’s death, Isaac soon has to contend with a world that doesn’t understand him. Your interpretation of everything that’s happening around you, or what you mean to your family, is soon complicated by symbols in his old book that you can somehow decipher.\n\nBefore long, you begin controlling things with your mind, from swiping dog food to tipping it over, spilling its contents into a dog bowl, to shunting the old mutt closer to the food, and that’s just one of the many telepathic scenarios you’ll encounter. It’s more of an interactive story than a game, but the writing and performances are what bring Goodnight Universe to life. The further in, the weirder things get as you discover more about the dormant powers Isaac has. By the end of this fairly short tale, you’ll likely shed a few tears, especially if you are a parent yourself.\n\nAs one of the few exclusively co-op games on the market, Lego Voyagers is a beautifully crafted journey where players control a red or blue Lego brick. After witnessing a rocket launch go wrong, and part of it washes up on their island, the two bricks set out to discover the wonders of the archipelago. It might be a little fiddly at first, but soon you’ll be crossing rivers with makeshift bridges, sliding down pipes, and constructing new methods to cross a gap or reach the top of a ledge with Lego pieces.\n\nLego Voyagers is fairly light in tone, nothing speaks, and its puzzles aren’t mind-numbingly easy, making it a perfect game for a parent and child to share. There are lots of things to just mess around with, bringing out the inner kid and satisfying that curiosity, while also sharing in the game’s more whimsical moments, such as sitting on a swing set to take in the scenery. It’s not the longest game on the list, coming in at only a couple of hours from start to finish, but this is the definition of an experience that’s short but sweet.\n\nThe best bit is that only one of you needs to own the Lego Voyagers for you to play with a buddy, thanks to the Friends Pass. It also now has full crossplay, which you can use across any device despite previous announcements saying otherwise. You can even play with a buddy via the Friend Pass on a different console or PC from the one you are using.\n\nCabernet plays a lot like the social life part of a modern Persona game, but with a macabre twist. You are Liza, a newly turned vampire in a 19th-century Eastern European town, navigating her eternal life. Along the way, she’ll meet the locals, both human and vampire, with whom she’ll form bonds by sharing in passions of art, literature, science, and politics. Liza also has vampire powers she can use to manipulate those around her, should she choose to, but these usually come at a cost.\n\nFor us, it’s the level of choice that truly sets Cabernet apart from the crowd. Dialogue options not only appear based on friendship levels with the person you’re talking to, but can also require points in skills (which you can give a quick boost by wearing certain dresses) or by having more points one way or the other in the game’s morality system.\n\nIt’s also clear that Cabernet doesn’t get bogged down by its light RPG game mechanics. Instead, it focuses on telling a story with stellar writing, supported by its wide range of talented voices, bringing it to life. Compared to more combat-heavy RPGs, Cabernet offers a drastic change of pace, rewarding players who carefully plan their next moves and giving agency to their choices.\n\n2025 was a good year for kart racing games, and Sonic Racing: Crossworlds brings dimensional portals that alter the courses mid-race. One moment you’re speeding across a desert city, and the next you’re bouncing on alien plants, before returning to the original course for the final lap. Combined with Sonic All-Stars Racing: Transformed’s shifting vehicles from kart to plane to boat, depending on the terrain you’re racing on, this wacky racer is the perfect multiplayer game both online and locally. In fact, it has crossplay enabled across all platforms, so it’s far more accessible than its current competition.\n\nWhat’s more, the single-player offering is actually substantial. For every Grand Prix, you’re given a rival that you must try to beat on every track. Their behavior is more aggressive than that of other competitors, and the level of heat they have indicates their overall difficulty boost. Each race you win, outpace your rival, and collect all five red rings in the first three courses. The finale of each cup has everyone drive one lap of the previous three tracks in sequence, rewarding those who learn the shortcuts ahead of time.\n\nSonic Racing: Crossworlds also features vehicle customization and a huge roster of familiar characters, each with stats that change the kart’s handling, acceleration, and overall speed. What’s more, the list of drivers will expand thanks to a host of DLC characters from different universes coming out in the next year. Soon, it will be a bit like the Super Smash Bros of kart racers, but with free Sega-owned characters and paid-for crossover ones. These paid-for ones include Minecraft and SpongeBob SquarePants, which are already available, with the likes of Pac-Man, Mega Man, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Avatar: The Last Airbender already announced to be coming throughout 2026.",

Foreign individuals, organisations and entities will also come under its jurisdiction if their Antarctic expeditions are organised within or launched from Chinese territory.\n\nTo get permission for activities such as expeditions, tourism and shipping in Antarctica, applicants will have to submit detailed plans, environmental impact assessment documents, emergency response plans and proof of insurance or financial guarantees to cover potential liabilities, according to the report.\n\nAny unauthorised activities, violation of authorisation terms, or breaches of management regulations and environmental protection duties could result in penalties.\n\nThe draft law also encourages activities to be carried out \"in an environmentally friendly and low-carbon manner\".\n\nIt sets out specific requirements for the protection of Antarctic flora and fauna, waste management and disposal, prevention of marine pollution, as well as area protection and the preservation of historic sites and monuments.\n\nThe draft also includes provisions for responding to sudden environmental incidents, according to Xinhua.\n\nChina has established five scientific stations in Antarctica. Photo: Xinhua alt=China has established five scientific stations in Antarctica. Photo: Xinhua>\n\nChina acceded to the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 and its first scientific expedition to the continent was in 1984. Five Chinese scientific stations have been established in Antarctica so far. China also became a signatory to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty in 1991.\n\nThe government formally established an administrative permission system for Antarctic expeditions in 2004 and standardised the application and management process within the State Oceanic Administration in 2014.\n\nBut there has been a legal gap when it comes to regulating non-official activities in Antarctica such as private expeditions, commercial tourism, fishing and shipping.\n\nThe legislation also comes amid a surge in Chinese tourism to Antarctica. China has become the second-largest source of Antarctic tourists after the United States.\n\nThe number of Chinese visitors to the continent peaked in 2018 at 8,273, accounting for 16 per cent of the global total, according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which promotes responsible travel to the continent.\n\nThe State Oceanic Administration issued guidelines on Antarctic tourism in 2018, prohibiting acts that cause harm to the fragile polar ecology. Those who violate the guidelines will be blacklisted and restricted from entering Antarctica for one to three years.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.

From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic!

Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies.

This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive.

The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department announced Tuesday it was barring five Europeans it accused of leading efforts to pressure U.S. tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio did not name those he said fell foul of a new visa policy announced in May to restrict the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for censorship of protected speech in the United States. He identified them only as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations.\n\n“For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose,” Rubio posted on X. “The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.”\n\nThe five Europeans were later identified by Sarah Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, in a series of posts on social media. They include a former European Union commissioner and the leaders of organizations that address digital hate.\n\nRubio's statement said they advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the U.S.\n\nThe action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions.\n\nThe five named by Rogers are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton, who was responsible for digital affairs; and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index.\n\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, those targeted will generally be barred from entering the United States, and some may face removal proceedings if already in the country. Officials said the administration could expand the list if similar foreign actions continue.\n\nMost Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don’t necessarily need visas to come into the country. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security, so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.\n\nOther visa restriction policies were announced this year, along with bans targeting foreign visitors from certain African and Middle Eastern countries and the Palestinian Authority. Visitors from some countries could be required to post a financial bond when applying for a visa.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s nemesis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, has registered the highest approval rating among current political leaders, a new poll has revealed.\n\nA Gallup survey shows that Powell—whom Trump has long berated while demanding interest-rate cuts—is more highly regarded by Americans than the president, members of Trump’s Cabinet, and leading Democratic figures.\n\nThe poll shows Powell’s approval rating at 44 percent, compared with Trump’s second-term low of 36 percent. The president’s current approval is only slightly above his all-time low of 34 percent, recorded in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is the only other political figure in the poll to break 40 percent, with an approval rating of 41 percent.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (28 percent) and Senate GOP Leader John Thune (34 percent) post the lowest ratings, with Vice President JD Vance (39 percent), Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (36 percent), House Speaker Mike Johnson (35 percent), and embattled Attorney General Pam Bondi (36 percent) also registering uninspiring numbers.\n\nTrump is likely to be particularly irritated by how Americans view Powell. The president has repeatedly called for Powell to resign—at times even suggesting he could fire him as chair of the U.S. central bank—while unleashing a steady stream of insults.\n\nTrump has spent months attacking Powell as “stupid,” a “dummy,” and a “knucklehead” for refusing to slash interest rates to offset the president’s economically damaging tariff policies. The president was so blinded by rage at Powell’s refusal to bow to his demands that he appeared to have forgotten that it was he who appointed him in the first place.\n\n“He’s a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in July, despite nominating Powell in 2017.\n\nThat same month, the pair’s fractured relationship had an excruciating moment when Powell corrected Trump to his face after the president falsely claimed that renovation costs at the Fed’s Washington, D.C., headquarters totaled $3.1 billion.\n\nTrump suggested the figure had “just come out” when Powell questioned its source. After reviewing a piece of paper Trump handed him, Powell pushed back and explained that Trump was “adding a third building” to the total that “was built five years ago.”\n\n“It’s part of the overall work,” Trump insisted, prompting Powell to reply again: “It’s not new.”\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, has since cut interest rates three times this year as the central bank attempts to kick-start a struggling economy during Trump’s second term.\n\nThe most recent cut of 0.25 percentage points occurred on Dec. 10, lowering the benchmark rate to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "A tribute to Nation family we lost this year—from Jules Feiffer to Joshua Clover, Elizabeth Pochoda, Bill Moyers, and Peter and Cora Weiss\n\nAs this dismal year draws to its dismal close, it’s somehow consoling to reflect on the lives we lost in 2025—beautiful writers, influential editors, and committed activists, cherished members of the extended Nation family—and to look back at the writings they contributed to the magazine. Their words offer a much-needed testimony to the long, turbulent struggle for decency, democracy, liberty, and equality in this country and around the world. Whatever violent delights 2026 has in store, the legacies of those who came before can and should serve as an inspiration and a guide.\n\nAmong the friends the magazine lost was the satirical artist and screenwriter Jules Feiffer, who died in January at the age of 95. “Feiffer was America’s premier satirical cartoonist,” Jeet Heer wrote in an obituary, “the artist who best captured the tone and timbre of American public rhetoric and private anxiety from the time of Dwight Eisenhower to Bill Clinton.”\n\nIn addition to his long-running weekly cartoon strip in the Village Voice, Feiffer wrote plays, movies, novels, memoirs. Heer noted that Feiffer’s best work came when he allowed his satire to be leavened with empathy for the subjects he skewered: “He often balanced political contempt with human sympathy.” He had mastered, partly through a lifelong engagement with theater and acting, “the ability to look at the world through the eyes of even the most unsympathetic soul.”\n\nA few months before Feiffer’s death, Peter Kuper interviewed the legendary artist for The Nation. Feiffer had lost none of his dyspeptic bite in describing his trajectory from growing up in the age of Joseph McCarthy to living out his final years in the age of Donald Trump:\n\n[S]haking the cage is what I found myself drifting into doing, and finding I had no choice but to do that because I was living in a country that scared the shit out of me in terms of the direction it was going. And if you ask me how I changed the country, well, today I find myself living in a country where I’m scared shitless because of the direction in which we’re going.\n\nThe Nation published a number of Feiffer’s articles, speeches, and cartoons over the years, including a prescient depiction in 1996 of the proto-Trump GOP presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan, who grins mischievously as hordes of followers shout in joyous unison from the apparent safety of his enormous paws, about to be crushed.\n\nIn 1981, The Nation printed a version of a commencement address that Feiffer had given at the Pratt Institute about the mythology of “Movie America” in the age of Ronald Reagan. Though we live under a president shaped less by the formal demands of cinema than the must-watch spectacle of reality TV, it stills speaks to our moment:\n\nWith a hard-line ideology now in power, the stage is set for a debate that will prove or disprove arguments that have been chewed over for generations. Out of this debate will emerge a new American character either more authoritarian and repressive or more democratic and egalitarian. More curious and therefore more willing to suffer the complications and uncertainties that go with change or more willfully ignorant and arming to the teeth against the threat.\n\nWe are now full-fledged combatants in a war movie. A battle for the soul of the good old F.S.A.—the Fragmented States of America. I hope you’re on my side.\n\nIn April, the poet and critic Joshua Clover passed away at the age of 62. A professor of literature at the University of California, Davis, Clover was the author of a wide range of books spanning subjects from pop music to the political theory of riots, as well as several widely acclaimed poetry collections. Clover was long a fixture of The Nation’s Books and the Arts section. His first Nation review, published in 2007, concerned the poetry of Rod Smith, while his last was a sharp analysis and appreciation of The Get Down, Baz Luhrmann’s 2016 Netflix series on the origins of hip-hop. In between were almost impossibly erudite essays on topics from Baudelaire to economics, and a monthly column, “Pop & Circumstance,” which offered Clover’s perspective on country music, Game of Thrones, and Chomsky v. Zizek.\n\nJuliana Spahr wrote in her Nation tribute to Clover that “there were so many Joshuas, often contradicting yet frequently overlapping.” There was “Joshua the Militant,” a committed activist to the end of his life, and there was “Joshua the Political Theorist,” “Joshua the Scholar,” “Joshua the Organizer of Summer Camps,” “Joshua the Conference Organizer,” “Joshua the Publisher of Commune Editions and Editor of Commune Magazine,” “Joshua the Tweeter, lover of barbs and jabs, the shit-talker, the contrarian,” “Joshua the Marxist,” “Joshua the Organizer of Long Bike Rides,” “Joshua the Academic,” “Joshua the Connoisseur of Gummy Candies.”\n\nAnd then there was Joshua the Poet. He knew how to turn a phrase, build optimism, and remind us to love each other not just within occupied buildings but also within the short, limited lines of verse…. [I]f his writing is any one single thing, it is an invitation to join him in refusing to die.\n\nElizabeth Pochoda, a beloved literary editor of the magazine during much of the mid-1970s and through the 1980s, and a contributor for many years beyond that, died in May at the age of 83. Gene Seymour wrote a moving tribute to her:\n\nShe was one of those illuminated beings whose eyes entered a room—or your senses—before the rest of her did. Those wide pale orbs announced a hot-wired intensity that was at a higher, deeper level than most people were accustomed to casually encounter. To varying degrees, it was unsettling at first when Betsy aimed this intensity on you. Until you found out (and it usually didn’t take very long) that her focus was a gift, an acknowledgment that she’d seen something in you that aligned with her own formidable intellect and comprehensive passions. Such a meeting of minds promised fruitful and gratifying outcomes, especially if you were a writer and were lucky enough to have her as your editor.\n\nLike Clover’s, Pochoda’s interests ranged widely, from her first pieces for the magazine, a two-parter on the latest Czech fiction, to her theater reviews of the 1990s and her brief column “Reading Around,” a kind of high-brow pre-Internet aggregator of all the important essays and reviews and literary gossip worth taking notice of that week.\n\nIn addition to her involvement with many other publications, including Grand Street, which she helped found, and The Magazine Antiques, Pochoda kept writing for The Nation until shortly before her death, including tributes to former Nation comrades, Arthur Danto and Victor Navasky, an obit for Philip Roth, and meditations on American art and history.\n\nIn 2015, Pochoda wrote an essay for The Nation’s 150th anniversary issue reflecting on her tenure as literary editor—the freedom she enjoyed from the rest of the magazine that extended to her writers; the occasional political tensions and disagreements that resulted between the Books section and the rest of the magazine; her favorite pieces to reread—among them, Barbara Grizzuti Harrison’s 1986 critique of Joan Didion: “an outraged and outrageous piece,” Pochoda wrote, “wonderfully wrong occasionally and much more wonderfully right.”\n\nSeymour wrote in his obituary, “Betsy’s range of interests and her unerring instinct for matching writers with subjects broadened her reputation as a versatile, incisive editor and solidified the devotion of writers who followed her wherever she went, benefiting from her solicitousness and enthusiasm toward their individual voices as well as her insights into how to amplify and enhance their work.”\n\nWhat more can an editor do or be?\n\nJune brought the passing of Bill Moyers, one of the most influential journalists of the past 50 years. After beginning his career as a young aide and speechwriter to Lyndon Johnson, then as White House press secretary, Moyers grew disillusioned by the politically corrosive and morally indefensible Vietnam War. Leaving Washington, Moyers reinvented himself as a newspaper editor (at Long Island’s Newsday), then as a broadcaster, eventually becoming the most prominent media figure associated with public television.\n\nOver more than four decades at PBS—which he had helped create, as John Nichols reminded us when Moyers died—he produced and hosted landmark series like Bill Moyers Journal and Frontline, as well as countless specials on topics such as money in politics, corporate power, racial justice, faith, environmental degradation, and the erosion of democratic norms. Even as commercial media aided and abetted the concentration of wealth and power at the top of society, Moyers insisted that journalism should be a form of public service rather than entertainment.\n\nMoyers’s essays in our pages over the years touched on the corrupting influence of money in politics and the debasement of journalism in the age of media consolidation. In 2012, Moyers and his frequent collaborator Bernard Weisberger guest-edited a special issue, “The 1 Percent Court.” In the wake of the Citizens United decision, the issue assessed just how hollow the justices’ commitment to democracy had become. In his introduction, Moyers explained what would be needed to fight back: “[T]he battle is on many fronts, and will be won not only by voters on election day but by citizens engaged at every level of democracy and in every peaceful form of protest. There can be only one response to this usurpation of democracy: defiance.”\n\nIn November and December, respectively, we lost Peter and Cora Weiss, indefatigable activists who had spent decades supporting human rights and civil liberties in the United States and around the world. “He never ceased to push for a more just system, a more equitable system,” Peter Kornbluh of the National Security Archive said of Peter, a path-breaking lawyer, on Democracy Now! “There’s not enough words to describe how important Peter was to the progressive movement, to human rights, over these last decades.”\n\nPeter Weiss first wrote for The Nation in 1953 as a young attorney working in the field of international economic development. Through a long and illustrious career spent fighting to end the Vietnam War and South African apartheid, suing Henry Kissinger, and seeking restitution for victims of the US-backed Nicaraguan contras, among other causes, Weiss periodically returned to the magazine with new ideas and analyses. In 1993, he and two co-authors published a call for “Global New Deal.” The authors proposed replacing corporate-friendly trade pacts like NAFTA with “a new set of continental rules and measures, including the protection of labor rights and workplace health and safety standards.” Instead of nations’ signing agreements to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor, he called for them to team together to protect the environment, raise incomes for wage-earners, and divert military spending to socially beneficial purposes.\n\nCora Weiss, Peter’s longtime partner in both life and activism, died a month after her husband. She had written obituaries for The Nation about the German Green Party founder Petra Kelly and her fellow peace activist Dagmar Wilson. In 2016, she wrote a letter to the editor taking issue with an article the magazine had published that she considered overly critical and dismissive of the United Nations, where she worked with the International Peace Bureau. “The UN is only as good as its 193 parts,” she wrote. “Our world would be immeasurably worse without it.”\n\nAs it will be without these cherished friends of humanity, the nation, and The Nation. Let us profit from their wisdom.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F.

    "description": "The FBI has assumed the search for two missing boaters, one from Fort Myers and one from Boca Raton, as a federal missing persons case.",
    "fullText": "The search for the two men who disappeared from a boat in the middle of the Gulf has now become a FBI missing persons investigation.\n\nAfter four days missing and three full days of searching, Randall Spivey, 57, and his nephew Brandon Billmaier, 33, were not found by the numerous volunteers who assisted the U.S. Coast Guard's search mission by both sea and air.\n\nThe search radius covered approximately 6,700 square miles, which is about the size of the state of Connecticut.\n\nVolunteers from all over the Southwest United States joined the search mission, starting on Saturday (Dec. 20) and continuing through Monday, Dec. 22.\n\nThe United Cajun Navy, a volunteer-led nonprofit that specializes in life-saving rescue operations, also deployed an aircraft 100 miles west of Naples on Monday around 11 a.m.\n\nThe Coast Guard ultimately decided to suspend its active search efforts after carefully considering all the factors making this case, said Capt. Corrie Sergent, commanding officer of Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg in a press release by the USCG.\n\n“There is no harder decision than suspending a search. I am incredibly grateful for the crews, partners, and volunteers across this community who executed this massive search with the utmost professionalism, persistence, and compassion. We offer our sincere condolences to the families and friends of Mr. Spivey and Mr. Billmaier during this extremely difficult time,” Sergent said.\n\nThe FBI has now taken the case, classified as a missing person case, according to the Lee County Sheriff's Office.\n\nSpivey and Billmaier embarked on a fishing trip early morning on Friday, Dec. 19. They were supposed to come back that same evening but by 7:30, neither of their wives had heard back from them.\n\nThis prompted a call to the Coast Guard, and at 11 p.m., a helicopter had been deployed in search of the men.\n\nJust over two hours later, the families were notified that Spivey and Billmaier's boat was found −a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull\" −about 70 miles off the coast of Naples. The engine was still running.\n\nHowever, the men were nowhere to be found.\n\nThere were two life jackets missing from the boat, which made family members think Spivey and Billmaier could be wearing them.\n\nThe search efforts continued into the weekend as volunteers across Florida and surrounding states provided support.\n\n\"While this is heartbreaking, Brandon and Randy would never want anyone else to put their life in danger, and we know they would want this decision to be respected,\" Deborah Billmaier, wife of Brandon Billmaier, wrote in a Facebook post on Monday night.\n\nSpivey was a prominent Fort Myers personal injury attorney. He is the founder of Spivey Law Firm, where his wife Tricia Spivey is also a personal injury lawyer.\n\n“He's an amazing, amazing man and he's dedicated his life to helping other people as an attorney and helping them in their time of need. And that's why it's so touching that many people are now stepping up to find him,” Tricia Spivey told The News-Press on Saturday, Dec. 20.\n\nShe said that Spivey and his nephew loved to fish, and her husband had been fishing for over 30 years.\n\nOne poster on Facebook, Andrew Abel, recalled Randy\" as a \"dear friend and mentor.\"\n\n\"I will truly never forget how he was there for me whenever I needed and without asking. Randy would drop everything he was doing to help. Always. Randy championed his family and friends and I'm forever grateful that he championed me and has allowed me to be a part of his family too,\" Abel wrote on Monday night.\n\nAnother poster, Cristina M. Puccio, wrote \"Randy has been a beacon of kindness and warmth in my life for many years, and I feel truly fortunate to have known him.\"\n\nLike his uncle, Billmaier was also a personal injury lawyer in Boca Raton with the Shiner Law Group.\n\nA statement by Shiner Law Group says: \"On behalf of everyone at Shiner Law Group, we are deeply saddened by the disappearance of Brandon and his uncle, Randy. Brandon is a valued member of our firm and someone we care about tremendously, both as a colleague and as our friend. Brandon is an exceptional person and a great lawyer, and we are heartbroken.\"\n\nBillmaier grew up in Michigan and is a graduate of the University of Toledo. Beyond fishing, he likes to play pickleball and travel.\n\nBillmaier also got married last year. Traveling is something that the couple did a lot of together. On social media, Deborah Billmaier shared that they've travelled to more than 30 countries.\n\n\"Brandon is my best friend, my husband and my greatest love.

    "fullText": "A California woman has been charged with murder after the remains of her missing 9-year-old daughter were found in Utah, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nAshlee Buzzard, 40, was arrested Tuesday after bullet cartridges found near her daughter's body were linked to a used cartridge case found in her home, said Santa Barbara County’s Sheriff-Coroner Bill Brown. Authorities found 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard’s body Dec. 6 in a rural area of Utah after a man and woman taking photos off of State Route 24 reported they had discovered remains.\n\nOfficers could not immediately identify her but concluded she died from gunshot wounds to the head, Brown said. The FBI's DNA analysis of the body found a familial DNA match to Buzzard.\n\nDetectives also found similar ammunition in a car Buzzard had rented, authorities said.\n\nBuzzard is being held without bail at the Northern Branch Jail in Santa Barbara, Brown said.\n\nOnline jail records did not list a court date or attorney who could speak on Buzzard’s behalf. The public defender’s office represented her in another case in November but did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA school administrator reported Melodee Buzzard's prolonged absence Oct. 14. Deputies went to the family's residence in Lompoc, but Buzzard would not say where her daughter was.\n\nBuzzard left California with her daughter on Oct. 7, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. They traveled as far as Nebraska with stops in Nevada, Arizona and Utah, and a return route included Kansas. Melodee Buzzard was last seen Oct. 9 on video surveillance near the Colorado-Utah line.\n\nDetectives learned the mother and daughter changed their appearance during travel. Video from the rental car office in Lompoc shows the child wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a wig that was darker and straighter than her natural hair, police said. The video shows her mother wearing a long, curly haired wig.\n\nBuzzard swapped wigs throughout the trip and changed the license plate of the rental car to avoid detection, police said. Buzzard returned home on Oct. 10 but her daughter was not with her, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nBrown said the crime was “calculated, cold-blooded” and premeditated, though a motive has not been determined.\n\n“Today, we stand together in grief, but also with resolve,” Brown said. “Melodee deserved a far better life than she had.”\n\nOfficials said the weapon has not been found, and the case remains under investigation.\n\nLilly Denes told the Los Angeles Times that her granddaughter was loveable, always smiling and well-behaved. Denes' son, the child's father, died when she was 6 months old. A detective told Denes on the phone Tuesday that authorities had “found the baby and the baby is with her dad,\" Denes said.\n\n“I knew he was telling me that the baby is dead,\" Denes said.",

    "description": "While Bill Gates has said the two-day workweek could come within the next decade, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says Gen Alpha college graduates will be too busy planet-hopping.",
    "fullText": "With Gen Z facing existential career crises, billionaire OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that in just 10 years, college grads will be exploring the solar system—jobs that will reel in sky-high salaries. The tech leader even says he’s envious of young people because our early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison.\n\nAs AI reshapes the workforce, many Gen Z college graduates are finding out the hard way that their degrees don’t guarantee a smooth career launch.\n\nNow, even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman—one of Silicon Valley’s biggest leaders driving the AI revolution—is admitting the elephant in the room is true: AI will wipe out some jobs entirely. However, the tech billionaire insists the coming decade could be the most exciting time in history to start a career, especially for anyone who’s ever dreamed of working in space.\n\nNot only will they be reeling in sky-high salaries, but Altman says they’ll also be “feeling so bad for you and I that we had to do this really boring, old work and everything is just better.”\n\n“In 2035, that graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some completely new, exciting, super well-paid, super interesting job,” Altman told video journalist Cleo Abram.\n\nThough it’s unclear how widespread space exploration will expand in the coming years—considering NASA’s broad goal of getting to Mars in the 2030s—aerospace engineers are growing faster than the national average of all jobs, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And they bring home an envy-inducing annual paycheck of over $130,000.\n\nOther tech pioneers have AI predictions that are more grounded on Earth—but still alluring to workers. For example, billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said that the technology might dramatically reduce the length of the workweek, thanks to humans no longer being needed “for most things.”\n\n“What will jobs be like? Should we just work like two or three days a week?” the tech billionaire told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed that AI has already given his workers “superhuman” skills—something that will only increase as the technology advances.\n\n“I’m surrounded by superhuman people and super intelligence, from my perspective, because they’re the best in the world at what they do. And they do what they do way better than I can do it. And I’m surrounded by thousands of them. Yet it never one day caused me to think, all of a sudden, I’m no longer necessary,” he separately told Cleo Abram on her Huge Conversations podcast series.\n\nWhile Altman admitted that his crystal ball remains foggy—and that the true direction of AI is unclear—he is actually envious of Gen Z professionals starting off their careers: “If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history,” he added to Abram.\n\nFortune reached out to OpenAI for comment.\n\nAfter the launch of OpenAI model, GPT-5, Altman declared the world has access to technology equivalent to a “team of PhD-level experts” right in their pocket. And as a result, the CEO said it will be easier than ever for one person to create a business that used to take “hundreds” of people—all it takes is coming up with a great idea and mastering AI tools.\n\n“It is probably possible now to start a company, that is a one-person company that will go on to be worth more than a billion dollars, and more importantly than that, deliver an amazing product and service to the world, and that is like a crazy thing,” he said.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban has gone even further with his prediction, saying that AI could give Elon Musk a run for his money as the world’s richest person.\n\n“We haven’t seen the best or the craziest of what [AI is] going to be able to do,” Cuban told the High Performance podcast. “And not only do I think it’ll create a trillionaire, but it could be just one dude in the basement. That’s how crazy it could be.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on August 11, 2025.\n\n‘Godmother of AI’ says degrees are less important in hiring than how quickly you can ‘superpower yourself’ with new tools\n\nForget the four-day workweek, Elon Musk predicts you won’t have to work at all in ‘less than 20 years’\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says ‘millions of people’ will be living in space by 2045—and robots will commute on our behalf to the moon\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "Zampella created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today, and his cinematic and epic military, sci-fi and Star Wars games thrilled and moved millions\n\nVince Zampella dies aged 55 – news\n\nOn Sunday, Vince Zampella, the co-creator of the Call of Duty video game series, died in a car crash in Los Angeles at the age of 55. Though best known for that series of blockbuster military shooters, Zampella touched a huge number of lives – not only the hundreds of people who worked at the game development studios he led under Activision and EA, but the millions of people who played the games that bore his imprint.\n\nA lifelong gamer, Zampella had a Pong console as a child, then an Atari 2600 and a Commodore 64. He told IGN in 2016 that his favourite game from childhood was Donkey Kong: “I would spend hours at the arcade playing it.” Zampella’s first job in the industry was at GameTek in Miami, which specialised in video-game versions of popular US quizshows. He described his role on the small team as: “producer slash customer services slash tester – whatever needed to be done.”\n\nIt was at a developer called 2015, Inc in Tulsa that Zampella had his first smash hit as lead designer. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was the third title in the acclaimed series of second world war shooters, which had been inspired by Saving Private Ryan and written in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. Zampella had envisioned a new type of shooter with an epic, cinematic sense of immersion. The game was a bestseller, acclaimed for its globetrotting narrative and taut, tense action – especially during its thrilling depiction of the Omaha beach landing.\n\nWhen publisher Electronic Arts made the decision to take the development of Medal of Honour in-house, Zampella and his colleague Jason West left, together with Grant Collier, and set up Infinity Ward in Los Angeles. There they created Call of Duty, a second world war shooter designed to exceed Medal of Honor’s sense of epic drama – indeed, its original development title had been Medal of Honor Killer. Critically, the game featured a range of lead characters including US, British and Russian fighters rather than giving players control of a single “super soldier”. “It’s meant to show you that no one side won the war – it was an allied effort,” Zampella said at the time.\n\nOnce again, the emphasis was on dramatic set-piece battles on a vast scale, with the player surrounded by computer-controlled allies giving the impression of being a small part of a wider campaign. “We’re all about authenticity and intensity,” Zampella said. “We’ve strived to put as many guys on screen as possible. It’s about your squad, not you as a lone gunman.”\n\nThis emphasis on teamwork and cinematic intensity would become emblematic of Call of Duty. While two sequels remained in the theatre of the second world war, for the fourth title, released in 2007, Zampella and West decided to move into the modern era. The result, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is one of the most important and influential first-person shooters ever made.\n\nIts campaign features a group of special forces operatives, including newcomer John “Soap” MacTavish and grizzled SAS captain John Price, taking on Russian ultra-nationalists and a Middle Eastern warlord. It had imaginative and exciting missions, including All Ghillied Up, a sniper mission in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster, and the eerie Death From Above, in which players control the various weapons of a C-130 aircraft, taking out enemies on the ground who appear merely as dots on an infrared screen. Meanwhile, the game’s online multiplayer mode brought new innovations including kill-streaks, which allowed players on a winning run to call in special attacks such as airstrikes. Infinity Ward created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today. Call of Duty’s DNA is present in every modern hit of the genre.\n\nIn 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Infinity Ward by publisher Activision, and went on to form Respawn Entertainment, taking more than 30 Call of Duty staff with them. Under new publisher Electronic Arts, the company released Titanfall in 2014, a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter intended to innovate within the genre. The game emphasised the player’s freedom of movement, allowing for smooth, parkour-style navigation of obstacles and structures. Players were also able to call in and pilot giant, heavily armed mechs. As Zampella explained at the time: “It’s taking the old paradigm of these shooter games being very grounded and two-dimensional and now adding this verticality to it and making it something that’s a new experience; something that people haven’t seen before.”\n\nAfter splitting with Activision, Zampella advised several other game creatives who found themselves at odds with their publishers and were considering striking out on their own. One of them was Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear Solid and, at his own studio Kojima Productions, the Death Stranding series. “When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways,” wrote a “heartbroken” Kojima on X after Zampella’s death. “He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures”\n\nTitanfall’s sequel added an extraordinary single-player story to the original’s fluid online play – it is still one of the best shooter campaigns around. That series’ emphasis on smooth, seamless movement would also characterise Respawn’s entry into the battle royale genre: Apex Legends. Released with almost no pre-publicity in 2019, it would attract 10m players in its opening 72 hours and still maintains a place in the pantheon alongside Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone.\n\nRespawn next made two excellent single-player Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Zampella’s peers have noted that working on the Star Wars franchise brought him and his colleagues at Respawn great joy.\n\nIn 2020, Electronic Arts put Zampella in charge of the Battlefield franchise, with a remit to recharge the series after the disappointing performance of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Released in October, Battlefield 6 was widely praised as a return to form, especially the online multiplayer modes. It sold 7m copies in three days, the best ever opening for the series.\n\nZampella will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his era and a ceaseless innovator in the first-person shooter genre – and with the Star Wars Jedi series, outside it. He was someone whom you always looked forward to encountering or interviewing at games industry events, an outspoken creative who cared deeply about video games and the player’s experience.\n\n“Vince was an extraordinary person – a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognise talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,” wrote Geoff Keighley on X, who runs the Game Awards and, as a former games journalist, worked on a documentary about Titanfall with Zampella. “Even when it was difficult or uncomfortable, Vince never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency. He believed that the truth mattered, and he was willing to share it with the world. Vince cared deeply about doing the right thing. And even while working inside large organisations, he consistently pushed to put players first – to prioritise the experience, the craft and the people who played the games. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work … I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it.”",

    "fullText": "Home Depot has always sort of done its own thing as a large retailer.\n\nWhereas other retailers may hire any old person to stock shelves or ring up purchases, Home Depot tends to hire knowledgeable sales associates who are trained in specific trades.\n\nIf you need help finding the right bedroom paint, for example, there's a person for that. If you're being brave and tackling a bathroom remodel on your own, there are store associates who can guide you toward the right materials.\n\nPlus, the very nature of Home Depot is that it's a store customers tend to need year-round. That's why Home Depot maintains long hours throughout the year, opening as early as 6 a.m. and closing as late as 10 p.m.\n\nIt's that very consistency that customers have come to rely on.\n\nMany retailers close their doors to shoppers multiple times during the year. It's pretty common, in fact, for stores to be closed on holidays that include Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day.\n\nHome Depot, though, stays open almost every day of the year. And part of the reason is that the company prides itself on being perpetually available to customers.\n\nStill, Home Depot does draw the line with two major holidays — Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.\n\nThose are the only two days during the entire calendar year that Home Depot won't welcome shoppers in.\n\nIt's the same store-closure schedule Walmart sticks to, and it's one that consumers may find frustrating, given that they're used to Home Depot being open all the time. But while some customers may not like it, there's a reason behind it.\n\nClosing twice a year makes sense for Home Depot for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, the company maintains huge stores, similar in size to the Costco warehouses many customers find impressive but overwhelming.\n\nIt costs money just to keep a store that large running for a day. And given that Thanksgiving and Christmas aren't really big home-improvement days, foot traffic is likely to be minimal at those times.\n\nIt's just not worth the cost of staying open for what could be only a handful of customers.\n\nBut Home Depot also needs to keep its sales associates happy. These aren't any old retail workers — they're people who know their way around home improvement and specific products.\n\nGiving workers time off for these major holidays is essential to retaining good employees.\n\nCostco CFO makes rare pricing promise\n\nHome Depot faces growing consumer boycott calls ahead of holidays\n\nTarget’s efforts to make amends with customers hit a snag\n\nAmazon lawsuit could be a warning to other employers",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for China's AI companies is also being stimulated by ​Beijing's push for tech independence. China has fast-tracked blockbuster listings of chipmakers, notably Moore Threads (688795.SS), dubbed \"China's Nvidia\", and MetaX (688802.SS), which both debuted this month.\n\nForeigners see China closing ‌the tech gap with the U.S. as Beijing steps up support for AI chipmakers, spurring bets on Chinese companies just as worries grow over lofty valuations on U.S.-listed AI stocks.\n\nU.K.-based asset manager Ruffer, for example, said it has \"deliberately limited ‌exposure\" to the Magnificent Seven - the U.S. tech giants - and is looking to add positions in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) for a bigger exposure to China's AI theme.\n\n\"While the U.S. remains the leader in frontier AI, China is rapidly narrowing the gap,\" said Gemma Cairns-Smith, Investment Specialist at Ruffer. \"The moat may not be as wide, or as deep, as many think ... The competitive landscape is shifting.\"\n\nRuffer is gaining exposure to the AI theme through Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, which operates an AI chip unit, owns large language model Qwen, and is ploughing money into cloud infrastructure.\n\nGlobal asset managers are increasingly eyeing Chinese AI firms ⁠as a wave of startups lists on the mainland and in ‌Hong Kong, seeking to tap into surging investor appetite following the meteoric rise of DeepSeek, China’s answer to ChatGPT.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management in a report this month rated China tech as \"most attractive\", citing investors' search for geographical diversification and China's \"strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid ‍AI monetization\".\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) currently trades at 31 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 24 for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech (HSTECH.HK), which enables AI bets via stocks including Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK), Baidu (BIDU, 9888.HK), Tencent (0700.HK, TCEHY) and chip foundry SMIC (0981.HK).\n\nRiding the momentum, U.S. investment adviser Rayliant helped launch a Nasdaq-listed fund in September that gives investors access to \"China's versions of stocks like Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, and OpenAI\".\n\nKraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern said the ​rapid ascent of Chinese AI chipmakers such as Cambricon speaks to the scale and speed of innovation across China's AI and semiconductor industries.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to reallocate federal Homeland Security funding away from states that refuse to cooperate with certain federal immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary McElroy's ruling on Monday solidified a win for the coalition of 12 attorneys general that sued the administration earlier this year after being alerted that their states would receive drastically reduced federal grants due to their “sanctuary” jurisdictions.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency reduced more than $233 million from Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The money is part of a $1 billion program where allocations are supposed to be based on assessed risks, with states then largely passing most of the money on to police and fire departments.\n\nThe cuts were unveiled shortly after a separate federal judge in a different legal challenge ruled it was unconstitutional for the federal government to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get FEMA disaster funding.\n\nIn her 48-page ruling, McElroy found that the federal government was weighing states' police on federal immigration enforcement on whether to reduce federal funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program and others.\n\n“What else could defendants’ decisions to cut funding to specific counterterrorism programming by conspicuous round numbered amounts — including by slashing off the millions-place digits of awarded sums — be if not arbitrary and capricious? Neither a law degree nor a degree in mathematics is required to deduce that no plausible, rational formula could produce this result,” McElroy wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed judge then ordered the Department of Homeland Security to restore the previously announced funding allocations to the plaintiff states.\n\n“Defendants’ wanton abuse of their role in federal grant administration is particularly troublesome given the fact that they have been entrusted with a most solemn duty: safeguarding our nation and its citizens,\" McElroy wrote. \"While the intricacies of administrative law and the terms and conditions on federal grants may seem abstract to some, the funding at issue here supports vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs.”\n\nMcElroy notably cited the recent Brown University attack, where a gunman killed two students and injured nine others, as an event where the $1 billion federal program would be vital in responding to such a tragedy.\n\n“To hold hostage funding for programs like these based solely on what appear to be defendants’ political whims is unconscionable and, at least here, unlawful,” the Rhode Island-based judge wrote in her ruling, issued little more than a week after the Brown shooting.\n\nDHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department plans on fighting the order.\n\n“This judicial sabotage threatens the safety of our states, counties, towns, and weakens the entire nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"We will fight to restore these critical reforms and protect American lives.”\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general who sued the administration applauded the order.\n\n“This victory ensures that the Trump Administration cannot punish states that refuse to help carry out its cruel immigration agenda, particularly by denying them lifesaving funding that helps prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement.",

    "fullText": "DENVER (AP) — A Colorado woman suspected of killing two of her young children during a custody dispute with her ex-husband two years ago has been returned from Britain to the United States to face charges, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nColorado Springs-based District Attorney Michael Allen announced the extradition of Kimberlee Singler, 37, on charges including two counts of first-degree murder ahead of her first court appearance in the coming days.\n\nSingler was arrested in December 2023 in London just over a week after her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son were found dead in their home in Colorado Springs. Her 11-year-old daughter was injured but survived. The girl eventually told an investigator that her mother said God made her do it, according to court documents in the United Kingdom.\n\nSingler, who had superficial knife wounds, told police that a man who entered the apartment was responsible. She was initially considered a victim.\n\nThe surviving daughter backed up Singler’s claim at first, but police sought to arrest Singler on Dec. 26, 2023, after they said the girl changed her story. By then Singler was gone. She was found four days later in London’s upscale Chelsea neighborhood and arrested. It is not known why she ended up there.\n\n“Today really is a significant milestone in this criminal investigation,” Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez said at a news conference. “Singler is accused of committing an unthinkable act. ... I know these acts have deeply impacted this community, and our hearts remain with the victims.\"\n\nAllen said Singler will be held without bond at least until a preliminary hearing on whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed toward trial. That hearing typically is scheduled within 30 days of an initial court appearance, with some exceptions, he said.\n\nAllen and other officials declined to discuss details of the prosecution's case beyond procedural steps.\n\nThe FBI and Colorado Springs police traveled to London to take custody of Singler, who fought extradition and denied attacking her children.\n\nHer London defense attorney, Edward Fitzgerald, argued that she should not be extradited because if convicted of first-degree murder in Colorado, she would face a mandatory sentence of life without parole — a sentence that violates European human rights law.\n\nFitzgerald represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in his long fight against extradition to face espionage charges in the U.S.\n\nSingler did not yet have a U.S.-based attorney listed as representing her in court documents, according to the court clerk’s office.\n\nA judge rejected Singler's challenge in January 2025, and her bid for an appeal was denied in November.\n\nSingler also faces one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault.\n\nAccording to U.K. court documents, the children's bodies were found by police shortly after midnight on Dec. 19, 2023. Police said they found no footprints in the snow leading to a patio where Singler said an intruder entered through an unlocked door and attacked her, causing her to lose consciousness.\n\nShe told police that her ex-husband “had previously dreamt about killing his family, that the children’s father was always trying to ‘frame her’ and ‘get her arrested’ and to have the kids taken away from her,” Judge John Zani said in a January ruling against Singler in Westminster Magistrates' Court.\n\nPolice said GPS records showed that her ex-husband was driving a truck about 80 miles (130 kilometers) away at the time of the killings.\n\nThe family had been staying with Singler’s mother during the custody battle, but the mother was away at the time, according to court documents in the U.K.\n\nThe day before the bodies were found, a judge in Colorado ordered Singler to comply with a previous order to allow the father to take custody of them for the holidays, according to state court records. She was told to either give the children to her ex-husband on her own or bring them to a court hearing Dec. 20, 2023, to exchange custody there.\n\nOn the day of the hearing, Singler asked the judge to delay it, saying in a motion that she and her children had been attacked and two of them were murdered. She asked for time to grieve and “gain my bearings after this incident.”",

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance posted glossy photos of his personal training session with Navy SEALs—but the beachside stunt immediately drew mockery and accusations of political tone-deafness.\n\nThe 41-year-old former Marine, who served in Iraq before entering politics, had joined the Navy’s special-operations community for an early-morning workout at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California, a longtime hub for SEAL selection and training.\n\nFrom the official @VP account, Vance shared images on Monday of himself sprinting along the surf, hauling a log with helmeted operators whose faces were blurred, scrambling up a cargo net, and riding in a small boat punching through the waves.\n\n“Vice President Vance trains with @USNavy Seals at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado,” the caption read. On his personal account, Vance gushed that he had “just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes.”\n\nHe added, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!”\n\nCritics were unimpressed. “Nice cosplay as a Navy SEAL,” one user wrote, adding: “Leadership isn’t about photo ops, it’s about fixing the mess at home.”\n\nOther critics photoshopped the infamous meme of Vance with a cartoonishly puffy face onto the soldiers he was working out with, using “GI Jello” as a punchline.\n\nAnother commenter sneered that it was a “desperate photo op for a Vice President who cares more about his military ‘aesthetic’ than actually governing.”\n\nDigital strategist Mike Nellis jabbed: “Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks.”\n\nAnd Democratic strategist Christopher Hale wrote on X, “It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL.”\n\nVance’s made-for-camera workout follows a Trumpian trend of the president’s inner circle engaging in theatrics. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, 45, marked the D-Day anniversary and his birthday in June by leading a filmed PT session with troops on Omaha Beach before delivering a speech at the Normandy American Cemetery, a spectacle that also drew scrutiny as self-promotion.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly been mocked as “ICE Barbie” for using federal law enforcement as props in a string of stylized photo ops, from tactical-gear raids to glossy fitness clips.\n\nThis is also not the first time Vance has tried to curry favor with the military. Ahead of Thanksgiving, he delivered a comedy skit to troops at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the vice president’s office for comment.",
