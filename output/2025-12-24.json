    "description": "We could all learn a thing or two from Connor Ingram.",
    "fullText": "We could all learn a thing or two from Connor Ingram.\n\nThe 28-year-old goalie made 26 saves Sunday in his first NHL start since February, helping the Edmonton Oilers beat Vegas 4-3. It had been ten months since his last NHL game. Ten months since he entered the NHL/NHLPA Player Assistance Program (PAP) in March to cope with the death of his mother to breast cancer.\n\nThat was Ingram's second time entering the PAP.\n\n\"I've been through enough to know the sun's coming up tomorrow, no matter what happens in this life,\" Ingram said after the game. \"I've got a wife and a family that loves me. That's all that really matters at the end of the day. You want to win hockey games, but there's a lot more to life than hockey.\"\n\nThere's more to life than hockey. I know, crazy thought.\n\nBut Ingram knows this simple fact better than most. He first entered the Player Assistance Program in January 2021 to deal with undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder. He came back. He played. He won the Bill Masterton Trophy in 2023-24 for perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey after posting 23 wins and a .907 save percentage with Arizona.\n\nThen his mother died. And he entered the program again in March, this time to cope with grief that hockey couldn't fix.\n\nOilers vs Flames: Pre-game Stats 18-13-6 | 42 PTS\n\n\"There were a lot of days where I didn't think it (returning to the NHL again) would ever happen again,\" Ingram admitted. \"I mean, it's just the truth of it. In this world, it's a competitive game with 64 spots to do this. So you don't take it for granted any day, it's a huge honour.\"\n\nSixty-four goaltending spots in the NHL. That's it. And Ingram spent ten months away from one of them, dealing with personal challenges that had nothing to do with save percentages or wins and losses.\n\nUtah placed him on waivers in September. He went unclaimed. The Oilers acquired him on October 1 for future considerations, and Utah retained $800,000 of his $1.95 million salary. Edmonton sent him to Bakersfield, where he went 4-5-2 with a 4.04 GAA and .856 save percentage in 11 games.\n\nOilers Looked Decent Enough In Ingrams First Game Back And the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/edmonton-oilers\">Edmonton Oilers</a> lineup reads as follows:\n\nThose numbers aren't good. But Ingram was cleared from the Player Assistance Program on August 20th. He missed training camp. He was finding his game while dealing with everything that came before it. The statistics don't tell that story.\n\n\"If you surround yourself in life with good people, when you need them, they're there,\" Ingram said. \"And I think when you go through struggles, you find out people that really are around, and those are the people you want to keep around.\"\n\nSunday against Vegas, those people got rewarded. Ingram made his first save 37 seconds into the game—a tricky blocker stop against Ivan Barbashev that drew a loud cheer from fans. He was too locked in to notice. Seven saves in the first period. Nine in the second. Ten in the third when Vegas scored twice to make it 4-3.\n\nA Look Into Andrew Mangiapane's Slow But Steady Development With The Oilers Andrew Mangiapane hasn't been scoring goals. That much is obvious. His last one came November 3 against Nashville, and when he finally ended the drought Saturday afternoon in Minnesota—tipping an Evan Bouchard shot past Filip Gustavsson at 13:35 of the first period—it had been 21 games and 47 days since he'd seen one cross the line.\n\nHe looked comfortable. He looked like someone who's played 103 career NHL games and knows what he's doing. He looked like a goalie who's been through enough to know that making saves matters, but it's not everything.\n\n\"It's what you dream of your whole life,\" Ingram said. \"You don't dream of playing in the American League. You want to play in the NHL. So like I said before, you don't take any day for granted, and every day you're here's a good day.\"\n\nEvery day you're here's a good day. That's the perspective of someone who's had days where getting out of bed was the accomplishment. Days where hockey didn't matter because life was overwhelming. Days where the sun coming up tomorrow wasn't guaranteed to feel like a good thing.\n\nRetired Goaltender Coming to Oilers?: Maybe We Should Pump the Brakes a Little The Oilers' chaotic goaltending situation means rumors are inevitable. Does that mean talk of a retired netminder coming to Edmonton is a real thing?\n\nIngram is back now. Tristan Jarry is on injured reserve with a lower-body injury and will miss a couple weeks. Calvin Pickard is Edmonton's other goalie. Ingram will get more starts, more chances to prove the Oilers made the right call acquiring him in October.\n\nBut even if he doesn't, even if the numbers don't work out, even if this opportunity ends up being temporary, Connor Ingram has already won something more valuable than hockey games.\n\nHe's back doing what he loves, with the people he loves, after dealing with challenges that had nothing to do with the game itself. He's playing in the NHL again after ten months away. He's making saves and getting cheers and living the dream he's had his whole life.\n\nSpencer Stastney Is Quietly Becoming A Very Interesting Piece For The Oilers A hidden gem acquired from Nashville, Spencer Stastney's calm puck-moving and defensive reliability are proving invaluable to the Oilers' blue line depth.\n\n\"I've been through enough to know the sun's coming up tomorrow,\" Ingram said.\n\nWe could all learn from that. There's more to life than hockey. There's more to hockey than hockey. And sometimes, just being here is enough.\n\nConnor Ingram is here. And every day he's here is a good day.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "description": "Broncos dominate Pro Bowl selections with six named players and six alternates, highlighting Denver's elite status and dominant season performance.",
    "fullText": "The 12-3 Denver Broncos have stampeded their way into the league’s elite in 2025, sharing the NFL’s best record with the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. With this dominance, it’s no surprise that the Broncos will have six players representing the Mile High City at the Pro Bowl this year.\n\nEdge Nik Bonitto, guard Quinn Meinerz, tackle Garett Bolles, and cornerback Pat Surtain II have been named starters for this year’s Pro Bowl in San Francisco. They’ll be joined by edge Zach Allen and receiver Courtland Sutton on the bench.\n\nThere could be even more Broncos representation than the previously mentioned six, however. Quarterback Bo Nix, safety Talanoa Hufanga, linebacker Alex Singleton, fullback Adam Prentice, special teamer Devon Key, and returner Marvin Mims were all named as Pro Bowl alternates. If players decline their Pro Bowl invitation due to playing in the Super Bowl, injury, or another reason, alternates will fill in for them.\n\nDenver is already tied for the most Pro Bowl players this season with their six, tied with the San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks, and Baltimore Ravens. If an alternate is chosen, the Broncos would be leading the league in Pro Bowlers.\n\nIt’s deserving for each of the confirmed and alternate selections, as the Broncos are one of the deepest and strongest teams in football. It hasn’t been a one-man show in Denver; it has team wins to thank for its league-leading 12 wins in 15 games.\n\nFrom late-game comebacks to blowouts, the Broncos have continuously found ways to get wins at all costs this season. On both sides of the ball, Broncos players have stepped up in key moments and successfully built off their return to the postseason during the 2024 season. Hufanga and Prentice have both been named alternates in their first season with Denver, highlighting the front office’s success in bringing in talent that fits the roster and makes them better.\n\nDespite how big an honor it is to be named a Pro Bowler and even an alternate, the hope is that there will be no Broncos playing in the game. Instead, the players and Broncos fans would much rather see Denver preparing for a Super Bowl matchup after a year in which they have leaped becoming a true contender. For now, they’ll have to focus on securing the AFC West and the No. 1 seed in the AFC to get the coveted bye in round one of the playoffs.",

    "description": "The Highlanders had no answer for senior forward Tyler Bilodeau on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - Senior forward Tyler Bilodeau looked unstoppable on the court of Pauley Pavilion Tuesday against UC Riverside (6-8, 1-1) and he made that clear with a career-high 34 point performance to lead UCLA (10-3, 2-0) to a 97-65 victory.\n\nIt looked like a mismatch in play styles from the very beginning. The Highlanders' defense seemed set up to allow Bilodeau to break through in the paint and UCLA head coach Mick Cronin was well aware of that going into the game.\n\n\"They [UC Riverside] don't double, so I said, 'Buddy, you've got one night here where they're just going to let you keep dribbling until you shoot it. So go have fun.'\"\n\nHave fun is exactly what Bilodeau did. He shot 12-19 from the field, dominating in the post and even mixing it up with several fadeaway shots. In addition, he was freed up to shoot from beyond the arc in addition to his inside-the-paint dominance and landed four of his seven triples.\n\nNico Alba - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA forward Tyler Bilodeau (34) talking to coach during an NCAA basketball game against UC Riverside, Tuesday December 23rd, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAnticipating the matchup, Cronin slotted Bilodeau in the five throughout the game, a position he almost exclusively played last season, but hasn't touched as much with the presence of junior forward Xavier Booker. However, Cronin had Bilodeau there to complement his guard heavy rotation and put Bilodeau in a position to eat from under the rim against the Highlanders' outmatched bigs. Bilodeau's mobility and shooting skill gave him an advantage over his opponents playing the same position and he took full advantage of that.\n\n\"Whatever lineup works. Tyler's playing the five a lot recently. He's been getting open looks. Three guard lineup, we've been pushing in transition a lot more. We're just finding the groove before Big Ten,\" sophomore guard Trent Perry said.\n\nAnother major part of not just Bilodeau's big game, but the Bruins' scoring as a whole was the synergy between Bilodeau and senior guard Skyy Clark.\n\nWhile it was an off-day shooting wise for Clark, he was precise with his passing and ability to find open looks of his teammates. More than once Clark would use his signature mobility to draw defenders in before delivering a laser-sharp bounce pass to Bilodeau, who waited patiently under the rim.\n\nConversely, Bilodeau would use his size to box defenders out before shoving the ball off to a charging Clark and set a screen in the process to open up the lane, leading to a stunning one-two punch from the senior Bruins.\n\n\"It's great. We played together last year and carrying it over this year, we've just got a feel for each other's game,\" Bilodeau said. \"We know where we like it on the court. Just got to keep trying to build that chemistry and keep trying to win games,\" Bilodeau said.",

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals have a matchup this week against a terrible Bengals defense. The question is who will start at running back and wide receiver.",
    "fullText": "In Week 17, a struggling Arizona Cardinals offense will meet a common salve: the Cincinnati Bengals defense.\n\nThat group might be the worst single unit in the NFL. If not, it’s in a tight race with the Raiders offense. The Bengals rank 32nd in points allowed, 32nd in yards per game and 32nd in yards per play. For those needing a refresher, the NFL still has 32 teams.\n\nSo, the question is: Outside of Trey McBride, which Cardinals players will be in position to take advantage?\n\nAt wide receiver, the picture is complicated.\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. returned to action last week after missing two games with a heel injury, but he remained limited, playing just 51% of snaps and 62% of passing plays. His three targets matched a career low, outside of the two games that he has exited with concussions.\n\nEarlier in the week, head coach Jonathan Gannon was asked how Harrison emerged from the game and offered a mixed response.\n\n“Okay,” Gannon said. “I think he'll be ready for more. We'll see how it kinda goes here. Obviously, we had a plan for his reps, where he was at health wise. I know he wants to play more. So we'll see where he's at. Take it day by day.”\n\nOffensive coordinator Drew Petzing also acknowledged that Harrison is not at full strength.\n\n“Does it limit some of the things you're gonna do or some of the reps he's gonna get?” Petzing said. “Yes, maybe, at times.”\n\nBut despite Harrison’s limited role, his return still led to a decreased involvement for Michael Wilson.\n\nIn four games without Harrison, Wilson has averaged 10 catches on 15 targets for 125 yards. In the past two games that Harrison has played, those averages have dropped to three catches on five targets for 44 yards.\n\nGannon, though, noted that the Falcons prioritized taking away the Cardinals’ passing attack in last week’s game. They played cover-4 on 45.5% of snaps, roughly double the season-long rate of cover-4 that the Cardinals have faced. That was reflected in the target distribution, as 69% of Jacoby Brissett’s targets went to tight ends and running backs.\n\nThe Bengals deploy cover-4 at just a 5.2% rate, opening more opportunities for outside receivers. With Harrison still working through his heel injury, that could enable Wilson’s production to tick back up.\n\nAs expected, Michael Carter led the Cardinals' backfield in Week 16, following Bam Knight’s season-ending injury.\n\nCarter’s role, though, was smaller than anticipated. He saw 11 of the Cardinals’ 22 running back carries and played just 53% of snaps.\n\nEmari Demercado took five carries on a 32% snap share while Corey Kiner took six carries on a 16% snap share.\n\nBut when asked whether he anticipated Kiner seeing six carries again this week, Petzing instead took the opportunity to praise Carter.\n\n“I think it can always change based on the flow of the game and riding the hot hand and who's producing,” Petzing said. “I thought Michael did a really nice job in the run game, producing some explosive run gains. Really making some decisive runs and even some dirty runs that maybe were gonna be two or three-yard runs, turned them into four, five, six-yard runs.”\n\nAll nine of Kiner’s snaps came on one second-quarter drive, spelling Carter. That drive just happened to be the Cardinals’ longest of the game, at 13 plays, giving him more carries than expected.\n\nAs for Demercado, 17 of his 18 snaps either came on third-and-long or in end-of-half situations. That has been his role all season, as the Cardinals prefer to deploy him on passing downs.\n\nSo, what does that mean against the Bengals?\n\nCarter will likely be the early-down back, with Demercado playing passing downs and Kiner offering a change-of-pace option. If the Cardinals are leading, Carter could be more involved, while Demercado will see more usage if they find themselves trailing, as is typically the case.\n\nBut if the Bengals opt for a more typical defensive gameplan than the Falcons did — with fewer light boxes and shell coverages ­— the Cardinals could struggle to replicate their run efficiency. Their 5.7 yards per carry last week were their second most of the season.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, tight end Trey McBride and safety Budda Baker were the only two Cardinals’ players named to the Pro Bowl. Edge rusher Josh Sweat was named as an alternate.\n\nMcBride is having one of the best tight end seasons in NFL history, with 109 catches for 1,098 yards and 10 touchdowns. With eight more catches, he would set the single-season record for catches by a tight end.\n\nBaker, meanwhile, has taken a step back from his typical elite-level play. He is among the league leaders in missed tackles and has not stopped as many run plays at or near the line of scrimmage — partially due to a thumb injury that has forced him to play with a cast. But he’s been one of the league’s most impactful defensive players for the past decade, a status that often earns players Pro Bowl recognition even in down seasons.\n\nMcBride and Baker were both on the Cardinals’ roster when the current staff was hired in 2023. That means that general manager Monti Ossenfort has not acquired a Pro Bowler in his three seasons in charge, unless Sweat is added to the roster.\n\nOssenfort was the only general manager hired in 2023 but, as a comparison, eight general managers were hired in 2021 or 2022. All eight acquired at least one Pro Bowler in their first three seasons.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Assessing Cardinals' Michael Carter, Michael Wilson roles for Week 17",

    "fullText": "After a record-setting 2024, where Gangwon FC managed a second-place finish and qualified for the AFC Champions League Elite for the first time in their history, interest was high on what the Bears could achieve this year. With that in mind, columnist Nathan Sartain recaps Gangwon’s 2025, where the team followed-up on their newfound success with a commendable fifth-placed finish.\n\nIn a season of heavy transition, with Jung Kyung-ho taking his first step into a Head Coach role following the departure of record-breaking manager Yoon Jong-hwan, as well as key players Hwang Mun-ki (military service) and Yang Min-hyeok leaving, Gangwon can look back on their Final A finish as a success. Sure, it wasn’t always pretty, and their eventual fifth-placed spot was largely earned through a revival of form in the second-half of the campaign, but in a year where expectations on what the Bears could achieve had grown, the provincial club made some solid steps towards showing their desire to match loftier ambitions.\n\nA large factor in Gangwon’s respectable year was their considerable defensive improvements. Conceding 15 less goals than in 2024, the Bears also kept 15 clean sheets, the joint-highest amount in K League 1 alongside the title winners Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. And the team needed this solidity too, given that 11 of their 13 victories were won by a one-goal margin, including seven 1-0 triumphs.\n\nLooking far more composed and structured in defence, Jung Kyung-ho’s philosophy of limiting opposition teams to lower quality chances was a fair tactic to deploy, so much so that once some summer signings and military returnees reinvigorated the attacking line, Gangwon would lose only three of their final 19 league matches (seven wins, nine draws), and remain unbeaten in their Gangneung home. So yes, the team mightn’t have grabbed the same amount of headlines this time around, but attaining the club's second-highest finish, second-highest points total, and a likely AFC Champions League Two spot for 2026 is nothing to hand-wave.\n\nIn 2024, Yoon Jong-hwan had Gangwon firing in attack, and they went on to score 62 times across the season, the joint-highest in the division (whilst breaking the club’s record for goals in a season). This year, however, the Bears managed just 37 goals, the lowest total across K League 1.\n\nIt wasn’t just an issue with being clinical, either. Jung Kyung-ho’s men had the second-lowest xG total in the top-flight (43.8), the second-lowest shots on target total (3.8 per 90), and ranked ninth for big chances created (55). Missing Yang Min-hyeok and Hwang Mun-ki’s potency, Gangwon couldn’t really find avenues to create consistent goals in the first part of the season, but did eventually find a rhythm once a settled attacking quartet of Kim Dae-won, Kim Gun-hee, Lee Sang-Jeon and Mo Jae-hyun was established. Nevertheless, they will need more creativity in 2026 to avoid potential over reliance on defensive work.\n\nA reliable hand at centre-back, Shin Min-ha assuredly took on an increased role with the team in 2025, where he was trusted to start the majority of league games. Playing with a variety of partners in both three-back and four-back systems, the 20-year-old prospect largely kept a decent level of consistency too, averaging (per 90) 1.01 tackles, 3.84 duels won, 1.55 interceptions, and 2.98 recoveries.\n\nWith Shin Min-ha now set to “graduate” from Gangwon's symbolic number 47 shirt given to promising youngsters, the goal for the centre-back should be to continue establishing himself as one of K League 1’s finest young defenders, fine-tune some areas of his game, and remain on course to become another one of the Bears' standout squad members, regardless of age.\n\nDespite only signing in the summer, Mo Jae-hyun was one of Gangwon’s biggest catalysts for their eventual Final A finish. With five goals and five assists in K League 1 action, the winger contributed to 27% of his team’s goals this season, his directness helping transform the Bears’ style of play to a more proactive, front-footed approach.\n\nPer 90, Mo Jae-hyun averaged 4.15 touches in the opposition box, 1.4 chances created, 3.55 recoveries,  1.76 shots, and an xG total of 0.2. Helped by having players like Kim Gun-hee around him, the 29-year-old’s goal contributions also directly contributed to an uplift of nine points for Gangwon too, enough to showcase his creative spark whilst also ensuring the Bears were never in any danger of being pulled towards danger.\n\nThough not necessarily his own fault, Mario Cuze has to go down as one of the Bears’ biggest what-ifs in 2025. Signed in the winter for a relatively significant fee, the winger only appeared three times for Gangwon before being loaned back to his former club Zrinjski Mostar, where he has scored three goals in 14 appearances.\n\nWhether the Croatian failed to adapt to his new surroundings, if he struggled finding a place in a team that had undergone a significant squad overhaul, or if it was a combination of a wide range of factors some of which will never be known, the fact Mario Cuze is unlikely to return to the provincial club means his potential impact will remain a mystery.\n\nIn the last couple of years, Gangwon have prided themselves on sustainable recruitment. Not only have the club invested heavily in younger players, as well as seeking out hidden gems from lower divisions and rough diamonds from across the top-flight, but they have also managed to generate decent revenue from key sales of homegrown talent (namely Yang Hyun-jun to Celtic, and Yang Min-hyeok to Tottenham).\n\nWith that being said, a lot of success in 2025 came thanks to the summer arrivals of Kim Gun-hee and Mo Jae-hyun, experienced players who are 30 and 29 respectively. So with the top-flight now increasingly competitive, is now the time for a slight tweak to Gangwon’s recruitment processes? And, at least this season, should the Bears attempt to push forward by acquiring some more established names to bridge the gap between their short and long term goals? After all, the club only have three outfield players over the age of 30 in their squad, so more experience arriving may not be a bad idea.\n\nArguably more importantly, though, is the need for the club to retain its star players. In a marked difference from just a couple of years ago, Gangwon now have a considerable amount of quality in the ranks that could generate interest from other clubs, whether it be players with high ceilings like Lee Seung-won, Shin Min-ha and Park Sang-hyeok, or seasoned professionals such as Kim Dae-won, Lee You-hyeon and Seo Min-woo. Retaining the majority of their current squad might just give Jung Kyung-ho an edge over other sides in a different way, and reinforce the overall need for a quality, not quantity approach to the winter market when it comes to the necessary attacking and defensive reinforcements, whoever they may be.",

    "fullText": "Alvin Kamara makes it clear again: He only wants to be a New Orleans Saint originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSince the November trade deadline, Alvin Kamara’s name has surfaced repeatedly in speculation that the New Orleans Saints could move on from the 30-year-old running back.\n\nCompounding the uncertainty, Kamara has not played or practiced since Week 12 while dealing with knee and ankle injuries.\n\nLooking ahead to next season, the Saints are also high on rookie Devin Neal, though he is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury and has been placed on injured reserve. That has only fueled questions about whether New Orleans will revisit the possibility of trading Kamara this offseason.\n\nAt the trade deadline, Kamara made his stance clear on the idea of being dealt, saying he would go drink a “piña colada somewhere” if traded—suggesting he would rather retire than play for another team. He expanded on those comments during an appearance this week on “The Set with Terron Armstead.”\n\n\"I saw a lot of people looking at that and saying, like, I was holding the Saints hostage by saying that if they traded me, I would retire,\" Kamara said. \"Which is not at all what I was saying. What I was saying was the same thing I've said my whole career. I want to be in New Orleans, right? Period. In the simplest of forms. I want to be in New Orleans.\n\n\"If I were to have to play football somewhere else, then I don’t want to play football, that's all I was saying. It's the trade deadline, so things get read into a little bit more. It's like 'Well, they went to Alvin and asked him if he wanted to be traded. And he told Mickey Loomis that if they trade him...' I wasn't holding anybody hostage. At the end of the day, that entity, that team, they swing the gavel. So, I'm never going to go up there and be like if you trade me, I'm going to go home.\"\n\nFrom his perspective, Kamara said he wasn’t trying to hold the organization hostage — he simply wants to remain in New Orleans.",

    "fullText": "A physical altercation caused officials to end the Tempe McClintock-Glendale Raymond S. Kellis high school girls basketball game early in the Nike Tournament of Champions at Arizona Athletic Grounds in Mesa on Monday, Dec. 22.\n\nTempe McClintock coach David Williams told The Arizona Republic that a heated exchange among the game's spectators during McClintock's late second-half surge led to a fight.\n\n“There were some crazy, negative talking going on and that’s just part of the culture we live in now,\" Williams said. \"I know my people tried to ignore (him), but it went from there.\"\n\nDuring the consolation game for 11th place in the tournament's John Anderson division, McClintock (13-2) was on a huge run from the end of the third quarter into the fourth, and gained a two-point lead at 2:12 left to play. That's when the fight began, resulting in a decision to end the game early.\n\nWithout McClintock's top player, Lamaiya Woodberry (illness), juniors Anna Egorova and Niya Gamble and senior Ashley Shaw led the Chargers' 18-point swing. Williams was unaware of how the fracas began, but was more focused on McClintock's performance before chaos ensued at the early morning game.\n\n“I guess they had a couple (Kellis) girls that did some things to a parent, arguing or something, I don’t know,\" Williams said. \"I’m not just saying that to be stupid. No, I’m coaching my girls. Then somebody said, ‘Coach, look!'\"\n\nWilliams said the fight involved one of his player's relatives, but none of his players were part of the incident.\n\n\"Me and the coaches were trying to see what we could do to preserve the respect for the game,\" Williams said. \"It got outrageous to me. Like, who would fight over a damn basketball game at 10 o’clock in the morning?”\n\nThe Republic reached out to Kellis coach Shanelle Balark, but she was made unavailable for comment.\n\nThe incident is currently under investigation by Mesa police. No arrests were made.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Fight ends Arizona high school girls basketball game in Nike tournament",

    "fullText": "GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Green Bay Packers quarterback Malik Willis says his throwing shoulder is feeling better and that he expects to be available for Saturday’s game against Baltimore if starter Jordan Love remains in the concussion protocol.\n\n“I try to take it one day at a time, but I would assume that I’m going to be ready,” Willis said Tuesday.\n\nThe Packers held a walk-through on Tuesday, and Love and Willis were both limited participants.\n\nWillis took over for the injured Love in the second quarter of a 22-16 overtime loss at Chicago last weekend. He landed on his right shoulder while getting sacked on the final play of the fourth quarter. Willis stayed in the game and connected with Jayden Reed for a 31-yard completion in overtime, though the Packers eventually turned the ball over on downs.\n\n“The adrenaline’s pumping and, you know, we got to get in,” Willis said of playing through the injury. “We don’t have anybody else, so we’ve got to keep going. It was fun.”\n\nThe Packers may need Willis again on Saturday as they try to secure a playoff spot.\n\nThe Packers (9-5-1) would lock up an NFC wild-card berth if they win one of their final two games or the Detroit Lions lose one of their last two. The Lions visit Minnesota on Thursday.\n\nBaltimore has its own uncertain quarterback situation after a back bruise knocked two-time MVP Lamar Jackson out of the Ravens’ 28-24 loss to New England on Sunday night. The Ravens would be eliminated from the playoffs with a loss.\n\nThis matchup could mean plenty for Willis, who is set to become an unrestricted free agent after the season. The 2022 third-round pick out of Liberty has made the most of his limited opportunities with Green Bay.\n\nWillis played well against the Bears, going 9 of 11 for 121 yards and a touchdown while rushing for 44 yards on 10 carries.\n\nThe 26-year-old has completed 76.5% of his passes with five touchdowns and no interceptions since the Packers acquired him from Tennessee before the 2024 season. Willis completed 53% of his passes with three interceptions and no touchdowns in two seasons with the Titans.\n\nGreen Bay won both of Willis' two starts last season, including a 30-14 victory at Tennessee.\n\n“I think he’s done a hell of a job, man,” coach Matt LaFleur said. “I think it’s all about his approach, how he came in here, how open he was to being coached. We were pretty hard on him and his footwork, and he’s done an outstanding job. I feel like the more he plays, the better he’s gotten. It’s great to have a guy like him you have so much confidence in.”\n\nWillis says there’s a “night and day” difference in his comfort level with Green Bay’s offense compared with last season.\n\n“You’re just trying to learn the game plan each week and make sure you know what to do with the ball and how to get us lined up,” Willis said. “Now you can more focus on — you know why we’re calling these plays. Now you can focus more on the defense and how you want to attack them and just doing all the little things that help you be successful day in and day out.”\n\nNOTE: Rookie defensive end Collin Oliver was activated from the physically unable to perform list this week when tight end John FitzPatrick (Achilles tendon) went on injured reserve. Oliver, a fifth-round pick from Oklahoma State, said he tore his hamstring at the NFL scouting combine but never expected the recovery process to take this long. “I thought it would be 10-12 weeks when I had the surgery, and this is obviously far from what happened,” Oliver said. “I just had to take everything day by day. Now I’m here, I’m glad I’m here right now.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "In the eyes of one media outlet, Michigan State point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. has been one of the best at his position through the halfway point of the season.\n\nThe Field of 68 has released their mid-season All-American teams and Fears made the cut. Fears came in as a second team All-American selection by the popular college basketball media outlet.\n\nFellow Big Ten point guard Braden Smith of Purdue beat out Fears for the first team honors from The Field of 68.\n\nFears is a big reason for the Spartans strong start to the season, which currently has them ranked in the top 10 nationally. Fears is averaging just under a double-double through the first 12 games this season, with 10.8 points and 9.2 assists per game. Both of those numbers are notable jumps from what he averaged last season.\n\nIt's clear that Fears is a massive piece to the Spartans' success so far this season and will remain arguably the most important player for Michigan State. So it's both understandable and rewarding to see him get the acknowledgement he deserves from The Field of 68.\n\nClick on the post below to see the complete midseason honors and awards from The Field of 68:\n\n🚨 Mid-Season Awards 🚨@TheFieldOf68's 2nd Team All-Americans! 🏆\n\n⭐️ @MSU_Basketball's Jeremy Fears Jr.\n⭐️ @TexasTechMBB's Christian Anderson\n⭐️ @AlabamaMBB's Labaron Philon\n⭐️ @UNC_Basketball's Caleb Wilson\n⭐️ @TexasTechMBB's JT Toppin\n\n🔗 https://t.co/ChPx2cnnvl pic.twitter.com/gY2RHbHUIg\n\n— The Field of 68 (@TheFieldOf68) December 23, 2025\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "description": "The Vikings Are Always on the Naughty List",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings won an ugly 16-13 affair in the swamps of Jersey against the New York Giants to improve to 7-8 on the season.\n\nAnother injury to J.J. McCarthy overshadowed the victory, this time to his throwing hand. The good news appears to be that there are no broken bones, but his availability for the Christmas Day game on a quick turnaround looks unlikely. If he does indeed miss Thursday’s game, it will mark the seventh time this season he’ll be inactive. He has now missed 24 of 32 (75%) possible games since the start of the 2024 season. Not ideal.\n\n(NOTE: After Shawn completed his article, the Vikings did rule McCarthy out for Thursday’s game against Detroit)\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings and nice things go together like ketchup and ice cream. The final five games of the season were all about McCarthy and his development. With the competitive portion of the season over, it was the only thing worth looking forward to. And for once, things looked to be going our way. As a Vikings fan, that’s always a surefire sign that disappointment is making its way to the on-deck circle.\n\nWhile not as crisp as the previous two outings, there were still plenty of positives to take away from McCarthy’s first-half performance. He made a beautiful play under duress for a possible touchdown pass that Jordan Addison holds onto nine times out of 10. His fourth rushing touchdown of the year was a doozy and flashed the dual-threat potential that made me think he could develop into a smaller Josh Allen. His yards per pass attempt (7.7) remained far above the four games before his concussion, when he failed to hit 6.0. Heck, even his chemistry with Justin Jefferson looked to be improving. Yeah, I know, the interception. C’mon now. Yes, the ball placement could have been better, but Nailor catches that, well, nine times out of 10. Ditto the 96-yard pick-six that was fortunately called back. When it rains, it pours for this freakin’ team.\n\nBut, alas, we’re back in the holding pattern after Brian Burns came unblocked and sent McCarthy to the locker room for the rest of the game. And no, it was not Brian O’Neill’s fault. It was a well-schemed blitz, combined with McCarthy holding the ball too long on a tunnel screen. You try to look for positives in such things, so I guess it’s good the Vikings now know without a shadow of a doubt that they cannot go into 2026 without a top-flight (and costly) backup. I love McCarthy, but you’re only as good as your ability to stay on the field. And so far, he hasn’t been able to do that.\n\nThis may ruffle some feathers, but the ideal scenario would be to get Kirk Cousins back here. He looked like a lock to be cut before Michael Penix, Jr. partially tore his ACL. Now the situation is a little murkier. The Falcons may still opt to eat the $35 million in dead money rather than absorb the $57 million cap hit (6th highest in the NFL) to keep him on the roster, not knowing how much he’d even see the field. He’s the only guy who, with 100% confidence, could step right in and execute KOC’s offense at an exceptionally high level. I don’t care if the ideal backup candidate would require some trade capital. The best schematic fit for KOC’s offense is the best schematic fit. If Cousins isn’t cut, go for the next best option. Either way, it must be prioritized come March. The Vikings absolutely can’t go through another season like this. The roster is too good, and the expectations are too high.\n\nAgain, the best option for the Vikings is for McCarthy to hit the ground running in September, stay healthy, continue to improve, become elite, and win five Super Bowls over the next 10 years. But at this point, the only fact at hand is that he’s been incredibly injury-prone. You don’t let your wishes father your thoughts. You go with what is known.\n\nAt this point, Brian Flores can name his price. Making him the NFL’s highest-paid coordinator is a no-brainer. I’ve long been on record saying Flores deserved a second shot at an NFL head-coaching job. It’s beyond overdue. If I had to put money on it, I’d say it’s finally going to happen in a matter of weeks. Selfishly, I hope for a repeat of the Ben Johnson situation in Detroit in 2024, when he opted to stay to wait for the best possible opportunity.\n\nI don’t care who you’re playing. When you hold an NFL offense to 13 (!) net passing yards and six points, you’re in some ridiculous zone of awesomeness. With two weeks to go, the Vikings’ defense is Top 10 in the following categories (among others):\n\nYes, the run defense took a step back this season, and yes, the lack of generated turnovers matters, but the bottom line is this team has absolutely no right to still have a chance to finish the 2025 season with a winning record. The only reason we are here is Brian Flores.\n\nI feel dirty even suggesting this, but I’m torn about this Lions game. If McCarthy does indeed sit it out, it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if we… gulp… lose. If this were the Packers or the Bears, I’d never say that. Yes, we can ruin the Lions’ season. That would be good. But you always need to keep an eye on the future. First, a loss with our backup quarterback would give us a better draft position. We’re currently 15th, but there’s a logjam of eight teams between 6-9 and 8-7. Second, a loss will keep us in last place in the NFC North, and with it, the benefits of a more manageable 2026 schedule. Yes, I know that only affects three games, but would you rather face the Giants, Titans, and Cardinals or the Commanders, Colts, and 49ers/Rams?\n\nIt isn’t very meaningful at this point, but this is what I had to say about Week 17 back in May:\n\nWeek 17: Detroit Lions: I expect this to have significance for playoff seeding and/or deciding the NFC North crown. I had us win at Ford Field, so I’m not picking us to lose at home. With J.J. McCarthy gaining experience every week, and Flores’s defense (particularly the corners) hitting their stride. Detroit is the known entity; margins for improvement are limited. We get revenge on the Lions this year, not only for Week 18 in 2024, but for going 1-6 beginning with that dreadful December 2021 loss that likely sealed Zimmer’s fate. You know, the one where Detroit came in 0-10-1. T.J. Hockenson grabs a late TD over Kirby Joseph to win it. Oh yeah, that works.\n\nNote to self: Do not write another “crystal-ball” article next spring. If you do, channel George Costanza and do the opposite.\n\nAs for everything I stated above about this game, the pros and cons, the cost-benefit analysis, the nuanced perspective, etc. – Just Kidding!!! I never want the Vikings to lose….ever. And to the freakin’ Lions? Pfft. I want to play spoiler and see Dan Campbell’s bunch watch the playoffs from home. I want to lean on that Super Bowl window even more to push it closed. I want it to achieve an airtight seal. And to do it with Max Brosmer? That would almost make up for this disappointing season. Well, no, that’s legit BS, but it would still be highly gratifying.",

    "description": "The NFL took action against the Steelers' star receiver on Monday after his incident with a Lions fan in Week 16.",
    "fullText": "Why did the NFL suspend DK Metcalf? Steelers WR receives punishment for punching Lions fan originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDuring a key matchup between the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, DK Metcalf gave the NFL an incident to settle.\n\nThe Steelers' star receiver, in his first year with the team as it pursues the AFC North title, was seen swiping at a Lions fan in the stands as he stood on Pittsburgh's sideline at Ford Field.\n\nBecause officials didn't see the interaction, which was caught by the CBS broadcast, Metcalf wasn't disciplined in the game — but he was considered sure to be hearing from the NFL afterward. On Monday, the NFL announced a suspension for Metcalf that is set to heavily impact the Steelers' final playoff push.\n\nHere's what to know about Metcalf's suspension after the Steelers star was seen hitting a Lions fan in Week 16.\n\nWhat to know about DK Metcalf getting physical with a spectator\n\nMeet Ryan Kennedy, the fan that DK Metcalf threw a punch at during Lions-Steelers game\n\nOn Monday, Tom Pelissero reported that the NFL is suspending Metcalf for two games without pay for his physical confrontation with a Lions fan. Metcalf appeal that ruling, but on Tuesday, the two-game suspension was upheld, per Adam Schefter.\n\nThe NFL's statement on the suspension called it \"conduct detrimental to the NFL,\" saying that \"Metcalf's actions violate league policy, which specifies that 'players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day.\"\n\nFrom the NFL on DK Metcalf being suspended two games for his physical confrontation with a fan Sunday. pic.twitter.com/zopnwRAI0A\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) December 22, 2025\n\nSome level of punishment was expected for Metcalf after Sunday's incident.\n\nMetcalf was not disciplined by the officials for his interaction with a Lions fan on the sideline. However, that was because the referees did not see the interaction.\n\nHe appeared to be the one who initiated the physical contact with the fan, which means his situation is unlike that of Lamar Jackson's earlier in 2025, when the Baltimore Ravens quarterback pushed a Bills fan who had slapped his teammate's helmet. In that instance, the NFL did not punish Jackson, as the fan was banned from NFL stadiums and the matter was \"addressed by the club,\" per ESPN.\n\nWhen a player initiates the physical interaction with a fan, it's typically a different story for the league. Metcalf is now set to miss the Steelers' final two regular-season games; he will also be missing out on $277,777 per game check, per Jonathan Jones.\n\nMORE:What to know about the NFL's personal conduct policy\n\nMetcalf will be eligible to return to the Steelers roster on Monday, Jan. 5, after Week 18 is over.\n\nThat means he will miss Pittburgh's final two games of the regular season against the Browns and Ravens.\n\nHere's the moment Metcalf was seen hitting a Lions fan in Sunday's game.\n\nCBS reporter Tracy Wolfson said the fan said something to Metcalf before he swiped at him.\n\nPer ESPN, the Detroit Free Press spoke to the fan in the altercation, and he identified himself as Ryan Kennedy from Pinckney, Michigan. He said he called Metcalf by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.\n\n\"I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,\" Kennedy told the Free Press, per ESPN. \"I'm a little shocked.

Kennedy said that the incident occurred because he called Metcalf by his full name, and the Steelers receiver did not like that.\n\n\"He doesn’t like his government name. I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,\" Kennedy said. \"I’m a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me. I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n\nAdditionally, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported that Kennedy and Metcalf have history. Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy last year when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and reported the fan to security.\n\nAfter some rumors over Kennedy using hateful language in the incident, the Lions fan released a statement denying that he used any racial or derogatory language to Metcalf in the interaction through his lawyer.\n\n\"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game.

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Steelers will try to clinch a playoff berth on Sunday, but they might need to do it without DK Metcalf.\n\nThe star wide receiver was suspended two games by the NFL “for conduct detrimental to the NFL for initiating a physical confrontation with a fan” during Sunday’s win against the Detroit Lions at Ford Field.\n\nMetcalf’s actions violated the NFL’s policy that says, “players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and … if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable.”\n\nVideo showed Metcalf engaging with the fan, identified as Ryan Kennedy, grabbing his shirt collar then forecfully letting go. Rumors surfaced on social media that Kennedy used racial slurs and called Metcalf’s mother a derogatory term. Kennedy denied using racist and misogynistic slurs, and told the Detroit Free Press that he used Metcalf’s full name — DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf — which prompted the reaction from the wideout.\n\nESPN reported Metcalf had issues with the same fan while he played for the Seattle Seahawks and reported him to security in the past.\n\nMetcalf will appeal his suspension, but if it is upheld, he will miss the final two regular season games. The suspension will also void $45 million in future guaranteed money.\n\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin told reporters Metcalf will have his hearing at some point on Tuesday.\n\n“He did explain to me why he did what he did, and I certainly don’t condone the behavior, but I support DK,” Tomlin said. “And I really don’t have a lot to add other than what I just told you,\n\nThe Steelers are atop the AFC North with a 9-6 record.

    "description": "With Opening Day three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business.",
    "fullText": "For the Atlanta Braves, 2025 was an avalanche of disappointment.\n\nEntering the season on a seven-year postseason streak, the Braves were considered championship contenders, the National League’s best chance at unseating the juggernaut Dodgers. With a strong core of experienced position players, the NL’s reigning Cy Young in Chris Sale and a pair of superstars coming back from injury in Ronald Acuña Jr. and Spencer Strider, Atlanta began the season with 93.4% playoff odds, according to FanGraphs.\n\nInstead, a depleted, injury-plagued Braves club trudged to a shocking 76-86 record and a fourth-place finish in a down NL East.\n\nThankfully, the autopsy is pretty straightforward. Sale and key rotation piece Spencer Schwellenbach both spent long stretches on the IL. The same was true for third baseman Austin Riley, who underperformed when available. Strider looked rusty and out of sync upon his return from Tommy John. Stalwarts such as Ozzie Albies, Michael Harris II, Marcel Ozuna and Sean Murphy all struggled offensively. The emergence of NL Rookie of the Year Drake Baldwin was an invigorating development, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the simple fact that too many important players spent too much time watching baseball instead of playing it.\n\nBut the future, at Truist Park, is not lost.\n\nBecause as disappointing as last season was for Atlanta, the club’s front office has conducted business this winter like a team fully expecting to contend in 2026. President of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos is clearly treating 2025 as a blip, an aberration, a fluke. With the new year still a week away, Atlanta’s head honcho has arguably done more to reinforce his roster than any other exec.\n\nThe Braves have signed six MLB free agents, a tally that ranks second so far this offseason behind the Cubs. To that sextet, Atlanta has guaranteed more than $106 million, the fifth-largest outlay as of Tuesday. The spending itself is not particularly shocking — the Braves have always run a top-10 payroll under Anthopoulos — but the team’s unflinching aggression is a reminder that the Braves are still a formidable presence in the National League.\n\nTo be fair, none of Atlanta’s additions was significant enough to warrant an in-person, jersey-unveiling press conference. But the Braves are undoubtedly a better, more complete and deeper team now than they were two months ago.\n\n[Get more Atlanta news: Braves team feed]\n\nFormer Padres closer Robert Suárez was probably the newsiest acquisition, with the soon-to-be 35-year-old flamethrower joining on a three-year, $45 million contract. It’s a long commitment for a reliever approaching his baseball golden years, but Suárez still throws absolute gas and has been one of the league’s most reliable closers over the past few years. His 76 saves since the start of 2024 are the most in baseball.\n\nBut don’t expect that number to rise much higher, as Suárez won’t begin the year as Atlanta’s closer. That’s because the Braves also re-signed Raisel Iglesias, their longtime closer, on a one-year, $16 million deal. He’ll continue to handle the ninth, and new skipper Walt Weiss will deploy Suárez in the Swiss Army knife, fireman role. Veterans Joel Payamps and Danny Young were also brought in on one-year deals to bolster a bullpen that finished 19th in baseball with a 4.19 ERA in 2025.\n\nAnthopoulos and Co. have been busy refurbishing the offensive side as well. Back in November, Atlanta  swung a one-for-one deal with Houston, acquiring utilityman Mauricio Dubón in exchange for defensive wizard Nick Allen. Dubón isn’t a particularly good hitter, but he provides a lot of defensive versatility and is a perfectly capable bat. The Braves followed that deal with a pair of more needle-moving signings in shortstop Ha-Seong Kim and outfielder Mike Yastrzemski.\n\nKim spent the final month of 2025 with the Braves after the club claimed him off waivers from the Tampa Bay Rays. That move was motivated by the hope that Kim wouldn’t activate his opt-out and Atlanta would have itself an every-day shortstop for 2026. Instead, the Korean glovesmith decided to test free agency, a smart decision as it turned out. Kim, who was set to receive $16 million, ended up back in Atlanta on a one-year, $20 million deal.\n\nThat’s a hefty investment for a player who was both hurt and bad in 2025, but Kim has been an average big-league hitter for most of his career while providing ample value at the game’s most difficult infield spot. For the Braves, whose shortstops finished dead last in baseball a year ago, with a putrid 56 wRC+, it’s a price worth paying.\n\nYastrzemski, who joined on a two-year, $23 million deal, is an unspectacular yet remarkably consistent corner outfielder. The 35-year-old has been worth at least 2.0 bWAR in every one of his seven big-league seasons and has a career .809 OPS against right-handed pitching. Although he’ll likely sit against most lefty starters, Yaz will provide depth in the corners behind Acuña and Jurickson Profar while mixing in at designated hitter.\n\nThat Atlanta has DH at-bats to dole out is a development in its own right. Since Opening Day 2023, Marcell Ozuna has started 445 of Atlanta’s 502 games, postseason included. Now a free agent for the first time in his career, Ozuna usually hit enough to justify clogging up the Braves’ DH spot. But at this point, a reunion feels unlikely, as the Braves can use that space to cycle through Yastrzemski, Profar and whoever isn’t catching that day (Murphy or Baldwin).\n\nWith Opening Day still three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business. Anthopoulos added a pair of every-day bats, a valuable utility guy, two high-leverage relievers and some potentially useful pitching depth. Atlanta could enter the season with its current assortment of ballplayers, and prognosticators and projection systems alike would consider this a playoff team.\n\nBut if the Braves want to push the issue, there’s still one more area ripe for a splash: the starting rotation. Sale, now fully healthy, will lead the line as he prepares to hit free agency at season’s end. Behind him, there’s Strider (looking to recapture his pre-surgery form), Schwellenbach (missed the last few months of ‘25 due to a fractured elbow), Reynaldo Lopez (made just one start in ‘25 before undergoing shoulder surgery) and youngster Hurston Waldrep (impressed in a nine-start sample but remains unproven). Grant Holmes, Bryce Elder and Didier Fuentes follow as depth options.\n\nIf things break right, that’s a really interesting group with tons of upside. It’s also a group that has shown to be particularly susceptible to the injury bug. That’s what derailed Atlanta’s plans last season, and the same thing could easily happen again.\n\nTo lessen that possibility, the Braves could add one more impact starter to the group. Such a move, given the organization’s middling farm system, would probably have to come via free agency. Atlanta is already over the luxury tax by around $6 million, according to Spotrac. Cashing out for a big arm such as Zac Gallen, Tatsuya Imai or Framber Valdez would push the Braves well over the tax, something the organization is wary of doing.\n\nBut money is just money, and the Braves cannot afford another disappointing season. They’ve done a good job, so far this winter, of avoiding a replay of 2025, but one more big swing could make them quite a formidable character in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Who is the Lions fan that DK Metcalf punched? What to know about Ryan Kennedy and his history with Steelers WR originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Detroit Lions in Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season, but it wasn't without controversy.\n\nIn the first half, a clip went viral on social media of Pittsburgh wide receiver DK Metcalf appearing to punch a Lions fan in the stands. It was a quick clip, and no context was provided for the interaction at the time, but the video itself looked bad for the pass-catcher.\n\nMetcalf finished out the game because, by the current rule, the NFL can't intervene in a possible player disqualification unless there is a flag. Since the Steelers' offense wasn't even on the field, there were no flags, as the referees weren't even aware it had happened. He was, however, suspended two games by the league, a ruling that was then upheld after an appeal.\n\nWhile the public may never know exactly what happened to cause Metcalf to react that way, he may have a history with the fan.\n\nHere is more on the Lions fan that Metcalf punched in Week 16.\n\nMORE: DK Metcalf throws punch at fan during Lions-Steelers game\n\nThe Lions fan whom Metcalf punched is named Ryan Kennedy.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press was able to track him down after the game for his side of the story. He said he was \"a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me. I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n\nInitially, when asked his name, Kennedy said, \"My name is 'Biggest Detroit Lions Fan Ever that got attacked by DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.'\"\n\nAbout the incident, Kennedy said, \"He doesn’t like his government name. I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt. I’m a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me. I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n\nLions officials talked to him, and he was not thrown out of the game.\n\nMORE: Will DK Metcalf be suspended by NFL for punching fan?\n\nThe public may never officially know the truth behind what caused the incident. Kennedy told the Detroit Free Press after the game that he called the wide receiver by his legal name, causing the outburst.\n\nSources told NFL Network's Tom Pelissero that Kennedy and Metcalf have history. Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy last year when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and he reported the fan to stadium security.\n\nChad Ochocino said on a live stream appearance with Shannon Sharpe that sources told him that the fan called Metcalf a racial slur, and then made derogatory comments about the player's mother, but none of these claims have been confirmed.\n\nMetcalf's real name is DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, but he prefers to go by DK.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture in Week 16\n\nAfter the claims from Ochocinco that Kennedy used racial or derogatory language against Metcalf, the Lions fan, via his lawyer, released a statement denying that report.\n\nThe statement reads, \"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game. These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nGiven that the incident is now likely going to be a legal matter, Kennedy had no further comment at this time.\n\nRyan Kennedy, the fan involved in the DK Metcalf altercation Sunday, has issued a statement through an attorney “categorically denying using the “N-word,” the “C-word,” or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident.\n\n“These allegations are completely false.” pic.twitter.com/pQUbBYa0ww\n\n— Brooke Pryor (@bepryor) December 22, 2025\n\nHere is the initial clip that went viral on social media.\n\n#Steelers WR DK Metcalf upset with a fan… pic.twitter.com/eoZJjIiXHw\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 21, 2025\n\nHere is the clip released later from a different angle.\n\nAnother angle of the DK Metcalf incident with a #Lions fan during Sunday’s game:\n\n(via alexhamed3/IG, h/t @BussinWTB)pic.twitter.com/YTEjVwDZcohttps://t.co/d0lOJ9lu8e\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 22, 2025\n\nAnd a third look at the incident released the day after.\n\nAnother angle of the DK Metcalf incident with a Lions fan has been released....\n\n(via keiffer_kennedy/IG, h/t @premefootball)pic.twitter.com/CwXWQZqAuIhttps://t.co/Ej5KLXFtUz\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 22, 2025\n\nIt was reported the morning after the incident that Metcalf may actually have a history with Kennedy.\n\nAccording to Pelissero, Metcalf may have run into Kennedy at a Seahawks game last season, and the wide receiver may have reported him to stadium security.\n\nHow Travis Kelce's retirement decision is easy with no Patrick Mahomes\n\nPanthers take control of NFC South with massive win over Buccaneers\n\nMyles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record with obscure half sack\n\nGardner Minshew suffers potential ACL tear in first Chiefs game without Patrick Mahomes\n\nQuinshon Judkins out for season after gruesome leg injury vs. Bills",

    "description": "In October, Seattle cut the 9th-year backup tight end from a school that doesn’t give football scholarships. Now look what he’s done.",
    "fullText": "How unlikely a Seahawks hero is Eric Saubert?\n\nHe’s supposed be crunching numbers behind a desk somewhere, not propelling Seattle into its first postseason in three years.\n\nThe man who caught the Seahawks’ most important pass so far this season, the most impacting catch of his nine, nomadic years in the NFL, is a former university Presidential Scholar. He has a bachelor’s of science degree in actuarial science.\n\nYou know, that science of using mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to analyze the economic costs of risk and uncertainty in everyday events. The stuff so many NFL players (don’t) dabble in.\n\n“I wasn’t every good at it, to be honest,” Saubert said with a grin at his locker in Seahawks headquarters Tuesday.\n\nThe native of Chicago, a middle child of four kids, did not have a major-college football scholarship. So he played at Drake. The private school in Des Moines, Iowa, is known as a mid-major power in basketball. Drake gives no athletic scholarships for football. Yet it competes at and beats other Football Championship Subdivision (former Division I-AA) programs.\n\n“I’m super-thankful for going there, too, man, because a lot that shaped me into who I am,” he said Tuesday. “I wouldn’t want it any other way.”\n\nIn 2017 he became the first Drake player in 34 years drafted into the NF, by the Falcons in the fifth round. Despite not being a regular starter, he’s playing his ninth season in the league. He’s been a special-teams stalwart and a backup, blocking tight end for eight teams in nine years. He’s gone from Atlanta to Chicago to Jacksonville to Dallas to Houston to San Francisco to Seattle.\n\nThe Seahawks signed him as free agent this past March. They cut him in October.\n\nHe came back, on faith that Seattle general manager John Schneider and coach Mike Macdonald would be true to their word and give Saubert a better deal than he signed last spring. His original Seahawks contract was a veteran salary-benefit deal. Those cannot be extended during the season.\n\nSchneider and Macdonald told Saubert in late October, after he had one catch in seven games, to hang tight for two days while they cut him in some more of the team’s constant roster gymnastics. He was briefly an unrestricted free agent.\n\nHe did as told. He hung out for a couple days. He ignored possibly signing with another team. He re-signed with the one that cut him.\n\nThe Seahawks gave him an in-season extension, rare for the team. It’s paying him a signing bonus up front of $500,000 plus a proration on a $1.3 million salary for 2025. That’s just over the league veteran minimum for his nine years. More important to him, he got a new deal for 2026. That could be worth over $2.1 million.\n\n“The organization is all class since I’ve been here,” Saubert told The News Tribune this month. “I appreciate them so much for getting this deal worked out. I’m so happy to be here for another year.”\n\nThen a week after he re-signed, Saubert went on injured reserve with a calf injury. Many teams would shelve a backup tight end on IR for the rest of the season once he got hurt in November. The Seahawks told Saubert how valuable he was to their run-first offense, that they intended to have him back healthy for a push to the playoffs.\n\nThey activated him from IR Dec. 13. He played the next day, in Seattle’s win over Indianapolis.\n\nThen last week in overtime of a wild game against the Los Angeles Rams with massive playoff implications at Lumen Field, the tight end with two catches in 15 games was blocking Rams 2024 NFL defensive rookie of the year Jared Verse. Quarterback Sam Darnold looked to his right at three receivers while trying to throw on the game-deciding two-point conversion play. Saubert blocked Verse some more. And some more.\n\nNo receiver was open. The Rams even covered running back Zach Charbonnet, who had drifted out into the left flat behind the line of scrimmage as the fourth, safety-valve option on the play.\n\nSo Saubert released from his blocking into a short pass route of about 4 yards, to just inside the goal line.\n\nWhen he turned his head left, Darnold appeared almost startled at how open Saubert was in the end zone. The Pro Bowl QB aimed his pass like he was throwing a dart. It stuck to Saubert for the two-point play.\n\nEric Saubert : Caught the game-winning 2-point conversion in OT pic.twitter.com/GvF1dCwdTI\n\n— Lee Harvey (@Sayian_Warrior) December 19, 2025\n\nThe guy who has three career touchdown receptions in 110 career games, who’s never played in an NFL game, completed Seattle’s comeback from down 16 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nSeahawks fans packing Lumen Field roared a noise not heard often inside that stadium in the last 10 years. Saubert held the ball triumphantly aloft in his right hand, basking in the rare roars. Then he chucked the ball as high as he could into the noise.\n\n“It’s incredible,” he said about a half hour later, inside the locker room after blaring music.\n\n“I’m kinda last in the progression. Sam is amazing. He knows his progression all the way through. I chipped. Come under late. Sam found me.\n\nSaubert put the Seahawks (12-3) two wins in their final two games, including Sunday at Carolina (8-7), from the NFC West title and top seed with the lone bye in the conference’s playoffs next month.\n\n“They’ve got two great edge rushers,” Saubert said of the Rams. “So we had a big chip-protection plan for them last week (with the tight ends helping the interior offensive linemen). That’s a huge part of the play, as well.”\n\nSaubert credited Josh Jones, the veteran swing tackle who made his first Seattle start against L.A. because Charles Cross was out injured. Jones kept his block long and well enough for Saubert to release his, and for Darnold to wait for his fifth receiving option to emerge.\n\nGiven he’s caught just three passes in the end zone in nine years, Saubert agreed he’s never had a bigger catch than that one that shook Lumen Field.\n\n“Yeah, no, I don’t think as meaningful as that one,” he said. “It’s a pretty cool moment.\n\n“Clinched the playoffs. Make us the one seed (for now).”\n\n“I’ve always had this belief in myself,” Saubert said at his locker inside Seahawks headquarters before practice Tuesday. “And it sounds crazy, even going to Drake, but I knew there was something inside of me. And I knew if I got stronger, faster, that I could do something special.”\n\nLast Thursday night, he did. “Just a phenomenal play, man,” Macdonald said of Saubert’s final catch for the winning two points.\n\n“Pretty good feeling when he caught it.”\n\nDarnold, himself forgotten after failed seasons as a starter discarded by the Jets and Panthers to begin his NFL career a year after Saubert began his, appreciates his backup tight end’s perseverance. All eyes, including the Rams’, were on NFL leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, former Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp and Pro Bowler Rashid Shaheed out on pass routes during the season’s biggest play in overtime last Thursday.\n\nYet it was Eric Saubert, the actuarial science guy from Drake, who made the winning play.\n\n“It’s unbelievable, man,” Darnold said. “That’s the beauty of the NFL. You have all these guys. You have JSN, ‘Shid, you have guys like Coop that make all these plays. And the guy that wins the game is ‘Sauby.’\n\n“He’s been in the league for so long. And I’m just very happy for him.”\n\nNot as happy as Saubert is that he isn’t behind a desk somewhere doing that other job he has a degree for.\n\n“Shout out to the actuaries,” he said.\n\n\"But I wouldn’t be having as much fun.”",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers have been dealing with injuries to key players lately. Austin Reaves, Deandre Ayton, Rui Hachimura and Luka Doncic have all suffered ailments over the last week or two, and it is one reason the team has won just four of its last eight games.\n\nWhen Los Angeles takes on the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday to wrap up a four-game road trip, it will still be without Doncic and Hachimura. Ayton will return to action after missing two games due to elbow soreness.\n\nReaves was originally listed as questionable for Tuesday's game. But he will play versus Phoenix, which will give L.A. a big boost.\n\nAustin Reaves has been upgraded to available for tonight against PHX, the Lakers announced. He will return after a three game absence because of a mild left calf strain.\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 23, 2025\n\nReaves is averaging 27.8 points and 6.7 assists a game while shooting 50.3% from the field and 36.9% from 3-point range so far this season. In 21 games, he has hit the 40-point mark three times already, and he had a new career high of 51 points on Oct. 26 versus the Sacramento Kings.\n\nHe has a history of putting up big scoring numbers whenever either Doncic or LeBron James has been out, and that is exactly what it will likely take for the Lakers to defeat a potent and feisty Suns squad.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers give huge update on Austin Reaves before Tuesday's game vs Suns",

    "fullText": "MADISON – The transfer portal departures are starting to really hurt for the Wisconsin football program.\n\nDilin Jones, who started the first seven games before suffering a season-ending turf toe injury against Ohio State, will enter the transfer portal with three seasons of eligibility remaining. On3 reported his departure Dec. 23 and Jones reposted the report on his Instagram page.\n\nJones finished second on the team with 300 rushing yards. He averaged 3.9 yards per carry and scored two touchdowns. His longest run of the season was 16 yards.\n\nHe opened the season with a season-high 73 yards in 14 carries in a 17-0 win over Miami (Ohio). His oher top performances were against Michigan (17 carries for 63 yards and one touchdown) and Iowa (16 carries for 69 yards), but most of his work came during a stretch of the season when the offensive line's struggles were their worst.\n\nJones was part of a 2024 recruiting class that also featured running backs Darrion Dupree and Gideon Ituka. Both players started two games after Jones' injury. Dupree led UW with 363 yards in 83 carries, a 4.4-yard average. Ituka ran for 255 yards in 60 attempts, an average of 4.3 yards per carry.\n\nNews of Jones’ departure comes one day after news of promising freshman receiver Eugene Hilton’s exit.\n\nThe offense also lost starting slot receiver Trech Kekahuna and running back Cade Yacamelli. Also, starting center Jack Renfro announced he will pursue a medical redshirt and seventh season of eligibility with another program.\n\nMore: Wisconsin football transfer portal tracker: Promising WR Eugene Hilton Jr. leaves\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin starting running back Dilin Jones heads to transfer portal",

    "title": "Patriots Power Rankings: High-stakes win boosts Pats up Santa’s Nice list",
    "description": "Check out where the Pats rank heading into Week 17",
    "fullText": "Here it is at the end of 2025 and I still can’t get over the turnaround from where we were last year. The Patriots were 3-12 heading into Week 17 and fans were rooting hard for a 3-14 finish to secure the overall No. 1 seed in the draft. That plan went about as well as anything else the team tried to do that year. A win over the Bills in the final game of the season dropped them to No. 4, but I’m not complaining. This season has been the polar opposite. New England had to be really bad for a couple years and hit bottom before it could rebound — and what a glorious recovery it’s been.\n\nMike Vrabel, Drake Maye and company have made football fun again. Frankly, that’s pretty much all I wanted on my NFL Christmas list this year, for the Patriots to be on a solid track back to relevancy. Fans have already received so much that anything more — like snagging the AFC East title from Buffalo (so close we can touch it), maybe being the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and then winning a playoff game or two (or three) — is gravy.\n\nGood things are all back on the table now, as the Pats prepare for a 3-12 Jets team that has lost their last 3 games by at least 23 points – and just lost QB Justin Fields to Injured Reserve. Meanwhile New England is a perfect 7-0 on the road. I have no doubt Mike Vrabel will be reminding his players about the big picture this week, needing to stay focused and not taking any wins for granted. Here’s to the Pats taking care of business at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, and I’m putting in a special request for no new injuries. Please, please, please Santa!\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) at New York Jets (3-12)\n\nBuffalo Bills (11-4) vs. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)\n\nMiami Dolphins (6-9) vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8)\n\nDenver Broncos (12-3) at Kansas City Chiefs (6-9)\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) at Indianapolis Colts (8-6)\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (9-6) at Cleveland Browns (3-12)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) vs. Houston Texans (10-5)\n\nBaltimore Ravens (7-8) at Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)\n\nCincinnati Bengals (5-10) vs. Arizona Cardinals (3-12)\n\nTennessee Titans (3-12) vs. New Orleans Saints (5-10)\n\nLas Vegas Raiders (2-13) vs. New York Giants (2-13)\n\n2nd – Pete Prisco (CBS Sports): Drake Maye’s showing vs. the Ravens helps his MVP chances. Coming back from 11 points down is a good sign for this young team as they ready for the playoffs. [+2]\n\n2nd – Eric Edholm (NFL.com): Down 11 points in the fourth quarter, on the road, with several key players injured, Drake Maye and the Patriots refused to die. Maye caught fire in the final quarter, leading two long touchdown drives, with Rhamondre Stevenson’s TD romp giving the Pats a lead they wouldn’t relinquish. The comeback win clinched a playoff berth for New England, moving the team into a dominant position to also claim the AFC East crown in the next two weeks. Losing Offensive Rookie of the Year candidate TreVeyon Henderson (concussion protocol) for any length of time would be a worry, and as mentioned above, that wasn’t the only notable health setback the Pats suffered in the game. They’re very thin on both lines of scrimmage right now but should eventually get help from players returning from IR, including OT Will Campbell and DT Milton Williams. They’ll be warmly welcomed back to a team that has outplayed all expectations and will be a fascinating case study in the postseason. [+3]\n\n2nd – Ralph Vacchiano (FOX Sports): Drake Maye’s MVP candidacy went into overdrive with a 380-yard, 2-touchdown performance and comeback against the Ravens. Now they might have a chance to clinch the AFC East next week. [+2]\n\n2nd – Vinnie Iyer (Sporting News): The Patriots went into more of an offensive slump in Baltimore with Drake Maye cooling and being contained again, putting their chances of stealing the AFC East in serious jeopardy. [+1] /Scratching my head over this one.\n\n4th – Frank Schwab (Yahoo! Sports): It’s not like the Patriots blew out the Ravens, who didn’t have Lamar Jackson for most of the game, but a loss would have made things a little more worrisome for them in the AFC East race. The Patriots won and their chances to win the AFC East race are at 80.9% with two games to play, via DVOA. They still have a 31.3% shot at the No. 1 seed too. It wasn’t the easiest win, but Drake Maye’s monster 380-yard game saved them from a rough loss. [nc]\n\n4th – NFL Nation (ESPN): Rookie of the year: Running back TreVeyon Henderson. He leads the team with 776 rushing yards on 146 carries (5.3 average), and has eight total touchdowns. Rookie left guard Jared Wilson described Henderson’s big-play threat this way: “Any time he touches the ball, it could end up in the end zone.” Henderson has four touchdown runs of 50 yards or more. The Patriots might be without him this week, however, as he exited Sunday’s game in the second quarter because of a concussion and didn’t return. — Mike Reiss. [nc]\n\n4th – Mike Florio (ProFootballTalk): The loss to Buffalo was a wake-up call. [+1]\n\n5th – Nate Davis (USA Today): QB Drake Maye had his first 300-yard passing game (380 actually) Sunday night, which included a career-high 31 completions. Definitely feels like the right time to put more on his plate. [+1]\n\n5th – Conor Orr (SI): I was struck watching the Patriots’ post-game interview how in line the entire team was—even Stefon Diggs. He deliberately sidestepped a question about the team’s playoff aspirations in a toned-down Q&A that revealed the totality of the Vrabel effect for me. It’s simply bigger than one person. [+1]\n\n5th – Diante Lee (The Ringer): The Patriots are ready for the playoffs.  New England didn’t see the best version of Baltimore on Sunday night—especially after QB Lamar Jackson exited with a back injury—but we still saw an inexperienced Patriots team ward off the Ravens in a game with major stakes.  After Baltimore’s defense sold out to stop New England’s run game, QB Drake Maye put the offense on his shoulders.  His efficiency in the fourth quarter didn’t just get the job done this week, it’ll be the reason why the Patriots win games in the playoffs.

    "title": "Americans Have Mixed Views of AI – and an Appetite for Regulation",
    "description": "A supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety.",
    "fullText": "AI is sweeping the American economy. A majority of Americans are either using AI tools or have tried them. But AI use is only half the story – a supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety. And many remain worried about potential job losses stemming from the emerging technology. \n\nIt’s time we did more to understand the national attitudes around AI use, regulation, and favorability.\n\nMost of our respondents had used AI at least once: 58% report using or trying AI, specifically tools like ChatGPT or Claude, divided evenly between fairly regular users (30% use at least a few times a month) and more infrequent users (29% have used AI, but only once a month or less). Nonusers are more likely to be older (62% of people over 65 have never used AI), not have gone to college (47%), or to work in service jobs (35%). Only 18% of white-collar workers say they have never used AI.\n\nAmong those who do use AI, 63% have at least tried it out for work purposes, and 34% report using it at work consistently (a few times a month or more). Work usage, like AI usage overall, is more common among white-collar workers, a majority of whom (55%) use it consistently. Personal use of AI is more common: 91% have at least tried using an AI chatbot or writing tool, and 54% report consistently using it in their personal lives. Gen Z turns to AI more often than its older counterparts, with 68% regularly engaging AI for personal use (compared to just 40% among Boomers).\n\nPersonal AI use encompasses a bunch of different types of application, but by far the most common is information gathering and answering questions (63%). Frequent AI users are especially likely to use AI as an alternative to traditional Google search or other research tools (68%). If this use case continues, messaging and communication on anything from public health to election campaigns will be filtered through AI models before reaching people. This could potentially change how messages are interpreted (particularly given the use of AI summaries), or significantly alter their reach in difficult-to-measure ways. Those interested in talking effectively to Americans should consider how their messaging strategy would work with these AI intermediaries, how their messages will be interpreted by AI, and if what they say will still reach their intended audience.\n\nWhile they know the names of the tools (ChatGPT, etc.), respondents don’t know much about the companies responsible for AI products. This is in contrast with older tech companies: Only 5% haven’t heard of Google, and 79% are favorable toward the company. For Amazon, favorability is at 80%. When asked about OpenAI, 42% hadn’t heard enough to form an opinion. For Anthropic, this figure hit 81%.\n\nAmericans don’t view AI as favorably as other emerging technologies from the past quarter century. Cell phones (76% total positive; net +68), the internet (75% total positive; net +66), and solar energy (72% total positive; net +65) are all viewed as having a very positive impact on society. AI (38% total positive; net +8) is \n\nWhen Americans are asked to think about potential future impacts on society, opinions of AI remain mixed, at a nearly even split of respondents between positive, negative, and uncertain impacts. Respondents believe that things like solar energy (70%), personalized medicine (57%), and nuclear energy (43%) will have positive future impacts, but are more skeptical of cryptocurrency (24% positive, 40% say it will have a negative impact) and self-driving cars (23% positive, 50% negative).\n\nWe also wanted to get a sense of how important Americans believe certain technologies to be. To provide some sense of perspective, we asked them to compare these new technologies to some they’re more familiar with. “Extremely important” corresponded to the steam engine and electricity, “moderately important” corresponded to the smartphone, and “not very” corresponded to the digital camera.\n\nWith these comparisons in mind, the median respondent puts AI on par with the invention of the smartphone. Only 7% believe that it’s more important than any other technology, with 16% of frequent AI users believing this, compared to just 5% of infrequent/nonusers.\n\nDespite uncertainty about AI’s overall importance, 70% of Americans say this technology will dramatically transform work, though they’re much less certain about the exact nature of this transformation. A plurality believes that it will make work easier (49%), but a majority believes that AI will bring down wages (55%), including pluralities or majorities across education, race, and partisanship. More respondents think it will hurt the economy (37%) than think it will decrease growth (29%), probably reflecting concern about wages. The perception that AI will replace human workers or outcompete them for jobs is a common one: 51% think AI will replace work done by humans, versus 33% who believe AI will supplement the work humans do. Service workers are especially convinced AI will replace (59%) rather than supplement (30%).\n\nA majority of Americans (56%) think that within 10 years, AI will be capable of performing most tasks that most people do at work. However, this drops significantly when respondents are asked about when AI will be able to do most tasks in their own job or field, with 43% thinking this will happen within 10 years, with no notable differences by educational attainment or work type. Customer service representatives are generally agreed to be replaceable within 10 years (64%), followed by accountants (56%) and manufacturing workers (54%). Fewer than 1 in 3 Americans think electricians, truck drivers, or doctors could be replaced by AI in the next 10 years.\n\nAround two-thirds of Americans (67%) are more concerned about the government doing too little to regulate the dangers of AI, versus doing too much and stifling progress (12%). At the same time, they don’t support a full ban on AI advancement, preferring progress to continue with requirements for safety testing (62%). Americans’ preference for safety regulations over the fastest possible progress holds even when they’re presented with the idea that regulating AI would put the U.S. behind China: Only 15% prefer a world where the U.S. government doesn’t regulate AI at all to compete with other countries like China over one where AI research continues under regulation, even if it develops slower than other countries (67%).\n\nEven in the most extreme case — presenting the choice between no further progress in AI at all and totally unregulated AI — only 34% would support unregulated AI development, versus 30% who think the government should ban research to improve AI, with a 36% plurality saying they’re unsure.\n\nIn terms of perceived dangers from AI, Americans’ biggest concern is AI taking jobs and causing unemployment (42%), followed by concerns about privacy (35%) and misinformation (33%). These are also the top three areas Americans prioritize for regulation. Respondents are not especially concerned about AI wiping out humanity (12%), but express greater concern about the use of AI resulting in loss of human control (32%).\n\nWhile respondents see AI as better than humans at being “efficient” by a wide margin (+44 points), AI has virtually no advantage on “being convenient to those they’re trying to help” (+2). Humans are still seen as wildly better in terms of being moral (+53), making complex decisions (+30), protecting privacy (+28), and being transparent (+18).\n\nWe also asked about the potential for replacing humans in specific governmental tasks, since this has been talked up by some AI proponents. There are only two specific tasks (from our list tested in this survey, at least) where AI is seen as better than human government employees. One is identifying trends in data (+18) and the other is correctly verifying the information in forms (+8).\n\nOn anything less concrete and data-focused, respondents strongly prefer humans. Human government employees are preferred over AI by 77 points for judging criminal trials, by 59 points for conducting airport screenings, and by 55 points for answering questions about government services like Social Security. Public interest in AI replacement of humans in government and other tasks is minimal.\n\nThis survey was run by Tavern Research via an online sample of 2,301 American adults fielded over web panels from August 1, 2025 to August 6, 2025. The margin of error is +/- 3%.\n\nNOTE: Because this is a web-based survey, we expect the total usage of AI to be slightly higher than the numbers found in non-web-based surveys. This should not affect the other conclusions.\n\nA question that was interesting, but didn’t lead to a larger conclusion, was asking what actually happens when you ask a tool like ChatGPT a question. 45% think it looks up an exact answer in a database, and 21% think it follows a script of prewritten responses.",

    "description": "Jon Rafman has been curating the images since 2008.",
    "fullText": "When Google Street View rolled out in 2007, it became the “world’s photographer.” Since then, artist Jon Rafman has been collecting moments captured by Google’s Street View cars.\n\nThe project is named Nine Eyes to reflect the nine cameras that are fitted to Street View cars. “Unlike traditional photography, these images have no author. The camera records everything but understands nothing,” says the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark, where Rafman is currently exhibiting his project.\n\nSince 2008, Rafman has been carefully selecting images from Street View, starting an archive taken from blogs and websites. He also joined the culture by finding pictures himself.\n\nRafman says that the cars with nine eyes are indifferent about what they photograph. But by curating them in this way, he develops the images in a way akin to how photographers used to develop photos in darkrooms.\n\n“There are the glitches in the technology that points to the artificiality of Street View, the happy accident of the error that creates something beautiful,” says Rafman. “There is also the more noir, hard-boiled street life scenes like the man with the gun, the prostitute, the drunks, all of the seedy underbelly. There is romantic imagery, the surreal, Jeff Wall-like images. There is ironic imagery, there’s the abject, there’s the beautiful, all the different poles of existence.”\n\nThe exhibition at the Louisiana is called Report a Concern, a nod to the message Google used to place in the corner of all its images. It is the first full presentation of the Nine Eyes archive, and as well as the images, it also features new AI-based pieces.\n\n“It explores how technology, surveillance, and memory shape our sense of reality in the digital age,” says the museum. “Nine Eyes invites the viewer to look again, not just at the world, but at the way technology sees it for us.’\n\nThe exhibit is at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebaek, Denmark, until January 11, 2026.",

    "description": "There has been an alarming spike in immigrants dying while in ICE detention during the Trump administration.",
    "fullText": "It’s official: December was the deadliest month for immigrants in ICE custody since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThis year was already the deadliest for those in ICE custody since 2004. In December, that trend continued, with seven immigrants dying in ICE detention, including four that died within a four day span, according to death notices published by ICE. Three of the deceased were held at facilities in Texas before they died. Four of the deceased died within four days of each other.\n\nFrancisco Gaspar-Andres, a 48-year-old man from Guatemala died on December 3, after being held at Camp East Montana in Texas since September. In his notice, ICE noted that although his “cause of death is pending, medical staff attributed it to natural liver and kidney failure.” The new detention facility at Fort Bliss has reportedly already violated dozens of federal standards for immigrant detention since welcoming detainees in August.\n\nPete Sumalo Montejo, a 72-year-old Filipino man who was previously convicted of child sexual abuse, died on December 5 at the Montgomery Processing Center in Texas. ICE reported that Montejo had suffered a number of illnesses throughout his time in custody: In June he was admitted for shortness of breath and hypoxia, and between July and November he was hospitalized several times for illnesses such as anemia and septic shock resulting from pneumonia.\n\nShiraz Fatehali Sachwani, a 48 year-old man from Pakistan, died on December 6, after being held at Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, since June. He was admitted to the hospital in November after experiencing low oxygen levels and tachycardia.\n\nJean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old Haitian man detained at Delaney Hall Detention Facility in Newark, New Jersey, died on December 12 from “suspected natural causes.” Immigrants held at Delaney Hall previously said that they were starved.\n\nFouad Saeed Abdulkadir, a 46-year-old Eritrean man, died in ICE custody December 14 at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania. Abdulkadir’s sudden death is reportedly the second to occur at that facility this year, and is currently being investigated by Pennsylvania State Police and the Clearfield County coroner.\n\nDelvin Francisco Rodriguez, a 39-year-old man from Nicaragua was pronounced dead on December 14, just one day after he was scheduled to be deported. He was discovered unresponsive and without a pulse at the Adams County Detention Center in Colorado on December 4, removed to a medical facility, and declared dead 10 days later.\n\nNenko Stanev Gantchev, a 56-year-old man from Bulgaria, died in ICE custody December 15 at the North Lake Processing Center in Michigan. While ICE wrote that they suspected he died of natural causes, his cause of death is under investigation.\n\nICE’s webpage dedicated to Detainee Death Reporting lists only 15 deaths in 2025—not including any from this month. However, at least 20 immigrants had already died in ICE custody as of October, according to NPR.\n\nICE is required to publish information about an in-custody death within 30 days.\n\nPresident Trump plans on ringing in the New Year by garnishing the wages of over 5 million student debtors currently in default on their loans, The Washington Post first reported.\n\nStarting January 7, the Department of Education plans to withhold a portion of the wages of around 1,000 defaulted borrowers. The number will gradually increase within the following months.\n\nNo, JD Vance will not be our first “Chad” president.\n\nThe vice president shared a series of photographs to X Monday showing himself valiantly running physical training drills with Navy Seals at Base Coronado, in California. Vance was photographed running down the beach, carrying a heavy log, climbing a large cargo net, and even rowing. Another set of photographs showed him speaking with officers, and posing for a photograph in front of a large American flag.\n\n“They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train,” Vance wrote on X, recapping his 90-minute PT session. “So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!” Vance previously served a four-year stint in the public affairs section in the 2nd Marine Aircraft.\n\nObviously, Vance’s critics were not impressed.\n\n“Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks,” Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist, wrote on X.\n\n“It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL,” Christopher Hale, a former Democratic congressional candidate, wrote on X.\n\nEven Vance couldn’t help but make fun of himself. He shared an edited version of the photograph that included his bloated, meme-ified face.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear what prompted Vance’s recent cosplaying adventure. Perhaps it has something to do with his recent presidential endorsement from Erika Kirk, a closely-held friend of the vice president. Or maybe it has something to do with his slipping poll numbers.\n\nA recent survey by AtlasIntel found that while Vance was still the leading pick to become the Republican nominee in 2028, a majority of Republicans no longer support him. Only 46.7 percent of respondents said they would pick Vance over other figures, down from 54.6 percent in a September poll.\n\nMeanwhile, a straw poll taken by Fox News at Turning Point USA’s Amerifest this past weekend found that 84.2 percent of respondents said they would like to see Vance as the Republican nominee in 2028, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis trailing far behind him. In order to claim the full support of MAGA, it seems Vance may have decided it’s time to prove himself more than a sniveling debate kid.\n\nThe Justice Department is now downplaying the Epstein files they took so long to release by claiming that they’re full of “untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump.”\n\n“The Department of Justice has officially released nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein,” the DOJ wrote Tuesday on X. “Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”\n\n“Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims.”\n\nWhile there certainly is some uncorroborated information in the files, there is also a wealth of new, possibly incriminating evidence about President Trump. One file contains an email from an assistant U.S. attorney from January 2020 that reads, “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than has previously been reported.”\n\nAnother file contained a 2019 letter from Epstein addressed to “L.N.” or Larry Nassar, the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of women and girls.\n\n“As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” Epstein wrote, appearing to reference his later death by suicide. “Good luck! We shared one thing… our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,” he said, signing off “J. Epstein.”\n\nEven as more information rolls in, it should come as no surprise that the Justice Department—which has been completely subservient to the president—continues to provide cover for him even as they release the heavily redacted files.\n\n“‘We’re releasing the documents, but please know in advance they’re fake, irrelevant, already debunked, totally harmless, and also important enough to issue a press statement about,’” one conservative X user posted. “If the DOJ tells you what to think before you read the documents, you already know they’re lying.”\n\nA bunch of masked male Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in tactical gear broke into the women’s bathroom of Cato nutrition bar factory in New York, even forcing a stall open while a woman in there used the toilet. They can be heard telling her to pull her pants up.\n\nICE agents illegally break into a woman's bathroom in a NY nutrition bar manufacturing plant. \"Pull up your pants,\" says a male agent. The agents only had a warrant to review employer documents. They didn't have a warrant to search for, detain, or arrest anyone there. pic.twitter.com/CnsGwkJzG4\n\nThe raid occurred in September, but the troubling footage was just recently revealed in court filings.\n\nThe officers justified their invasive actions by telling Cato’s owners that they had a warrant for a violent felon. In reality, the warrant they did have only allowed them to go into the building and seize documents, not kidnap a woman while she was on the toilet.\n\nICE eventually detained and questioned 57 people, even those who asked for a lawyer. At least 21 were deported and separated from their families.\n\n“I guess we found the men going into women’s bathrooms,” one X user mused.\n\nThe government found a photograph of Donald Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Steve Bannon’s phone. So, why did they redact it?\n\nBuried in the latest trove of documents released by the Department of Justice Monday, one email appeared to be from a federal investigator who said they’d discovered something while digging through Bannon’s iPhone 7.\n\n“As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon’s phone,” the email stated, passing it forward “in case it was of any importance” to someone handling “both cases.”\n\n“Thanks very much for flagging—no need to do anything on this one,” the person responds.\n\nDespite the fact that the Epstein Files Transparency Act only required the Trump administration to redact identifiable information of survivors—something that the government failed to do—the photograph of Trump and Maxwell was redacted in its entirety in the DOJ’s release. The sender and recipients’ names have also all been redacted.\n\nSo, what is it about this photograph in particular that warranted redaction?\n\nOver the course of his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump was photographed several times with Maxwell. The two attended parties and fashion events, and even traveled together.\n\nIt seems that Trump may be receiving some special treatment. In other photographs released as part of the government’s document dumps, former President Bill Clinton’s face remained visible while the faces of some other individuals were redacted. The DOJ even went so far as to release a statement to get ahead of the “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump contained in their own release.\n\nThe batch of files released Monday contained multiple disturbing revelations, including one email that suggested Trump flew on Epstein’s jet “many more times than previously has been reported,” and Epstein’s apparent suicide note that mentioned Trump’s love of “young, nubile girls.”\n\nEpstein files leaked on Monday night confirmed what so many people already suspected: President Trump spent much more time with Epstein—and young women—than he’s said he has.\n\nAn email from an assistant U.S. attorney from January 2020 reads, “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than has previously been reported.”\n\n“He is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was present,” the attorney continued, noting that Trump brought his wife, son Eric, and daughter Tiffany at times.\n\nOn one flight, the only three listed passengers were Trump,  Epstein, and a 20-year-old whose name has been redacted, likely a victim of Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nThis email completely undermines Trump’s various stories regarding his friendship with Epstein, from saying that he viewed Epstein as some kind of creep to be kept at arm’s length, to saying he barely knew him. Regardless of how their relationship ended, the president was flying around on a private jet with a sexual predator who abused children—which explains the lengths the administration went to keep these files from coming out even as a notable portion of their voter base recognized it as an issue.\n\nIt will be interesting to hear Trump and his helpers explain this one. Why would Trump fly on the sex trafficker’s plane multiple times? Did he just not know then too?\n\n“Trump was on Epstein’s plane, with Epstein victims,” one X user wrote. “Yet another reason why he was trying to keep the Epstein files from ever seeing the light of day.”\n\nWhat do Jeffrey Epstein, Larry Nassar, and Donald Trump all have in common?\n\nBuried in the latest trove of documents released by the Justice Department Monday, a postcard addressed to “L.N.” or Larry Nassar, the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of women and girls, mentioned Trump by name—and more.\n\n“As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” Epstein wrote in the alleged letter, appearing to reference his later death by suicide. “Good luck! We shared one thing… our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,” he continued, signing off “J. Epstein.”\n\nThe government also released an image of the envelope, which was addressed from Epstein to “inmate” Nassar, and was postmarked August 13, 2019, three days after Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York City. The letter, marked as return to sender, was addressed to Nassar at USP Arizona, where the high-profile pedophile had been held before he was transferred in 2018.\n\nLikely recognizing the harm that this letter’s authenticity would inflict on the president, the Department of Justice quickly announced \nTuesday morning that they would investigate its legitimacy. Less than two hours later they declared the FBI has concluded the note is a “FAKE”, citing the handwriting, postmark date, and an incorrect return address format for inmates. However, the DOJ did not choose to publish the results of the handwriting analysis originally obtained in July 2020, when establishing its authenticity would have been pertinent to a potential wrongful death suit based upon Epstein’s in-custody death.\n\nIt had previously been reported that Epstein attempted to reach out to Nassar, but that his letter had been returned. The government’s documents suggest that the letter was first discovered weeks later in September 2019, and was submitted for a handwriting analysis in July 2020. It’s not clear what the results of the writing test were.\n\nThe latest batch of documents released by the Department of Justice mention Trump’s name hundreds of times. One 2020 email sent by a federal prosecutor asserted that Trump had flown on Epstein’s private jet “many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).”\n\nThe previous batch of documents published Friday were heavily criticized for being incomplete. While the government made sweeping redactions to entire pages of documents, it apparently failed to redact the names of multiple survivors.\n\nJust days after plastering his name onto the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., President Trump will be naming a new class of battleships after himself.\n\nTrump is planning to make the naming announcement of the Navy’s new battleships alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Monday. An anonymous Pentagon official told The New York Times that Trump will call them “Trump-class” battleships.\n\nThe ship will be part of Trump’s vision of a new “Golden Fleet.” Each ship is expected to cost at least $5 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAs The New Republic’s Matt Ford wrote earlier this week—as bleak as the Gulf of America, the Trump Kennedy Center, the War Department, and others sound, Trump won’t be president forever. If he can change them just that easily, there’s no reason the next Democratic administration should hesitate to change them back.\n\nCBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss told 60 Minutes producers she was killing their story on the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador, where Trump deported more than 250 Venezuelan immigrants,  because it did “not present the administration’s argument.”\n\n“What we have is Karoline Leavitt’s soundbite claiming they are evildoers in America (rapists, murderers, etc.). But isn’t there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing?” Weiss wrote in a Sunday memo. “Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don’t tend to be shy. I realize we’ve emailed the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record.”\n\nWeiss’s decision to kill the story because it didn’t have enough perspective from DHS officials—who had already declined to speak with 60 Minutes—was met with uproar when it was leaked on Monday. But she doubled down.\n\n“We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera,” she said on a Monday staffing call, insinuating that the testimonies of CECOT inmates were insufficient.\n\nKilling a story about a brutal megaprison because the folks that are sending people to the brutal megaprison aren’t featured prominently enough has not been favorably received.\n\n“The Trump administration sent dozens [of] young men with no criminal record to be tortured and abused in a foreign prison,” podcaster Jon Favreau wrote. “@bariweiss can keep reporting, delaying, or kill the story altogether, but the basic facts have been well-documented in multiple court cases, including by Trump’s own DOJ and Trump-appointed judges.”\n\n“Bari Weiss’s main criticism is that 60 Minutes doesn’t advance the story,” writer Randye Hoder chimed. “But her solution is to ask Stephen Miller to regurgitate the same talking points this admin has given from the get-go, which we’ve heard a gazillion times)!”\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to comment. View the trailer for the scrapped segment here.\n\nHere's the deleted trailer for the now-\"delayed\" segment. It's almost impressive how much damage Bari Weiss has done to CBS News in such a short period of time. \n\nSomeone quickly schedule a prime-time Town Hall with Alan Dershowitz to rectify the harm:pic.twitter.com/382gRG5Lgp https://t.co/3gHRKNES2y",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to acquire Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory.\n\nThe president resurfaced the issue this week by appointing Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana, as a special envoy to Greenland.\n\nTrump told the BBC that acquiring the island is necessary for \"national protection,\" adding, \"We have to have it.\"\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told TV2 that the appointment was \"completely unacceptable.\" Denmark said it will summon the US ambassador to explain.\n\nEarlier this year, US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, traveled to the island. Following criticism from Denmark and Greenlanders over the trip, the Vances' itinerary was amended so they only visited the US military base on Greenland, a change the Danish government called \"very positive.\"\n\nGreenland is known for its long, freezing winters, stunning glaciers, and fishing industry, but in many ways, it remains a frozen mystery to much of the world.\n\nPart of that mystique is because it's been difficult for some tourists to travel to, except by cruise ship or lengthy plane rides. A new international airport is making the country more accessible, including to US residents.\n\nMarianne A. Stenbaek, a professor of cultural studies at McGill University who studies Greenlandic art and literature, described Greenland as a \"modern society with a traditional touch.\" That's because Denmark colonized it hundreds of years ago, but aspects of its Inuit traditions remain.\n\nFrom its arts to its cuisine, Greenland has a culture all its own.\n\nThe country is a little bigger than Mexico. It's also much colder. About 80% of Greenland's 836,330 square miles are buried in snow and ice. An enormous national park, the world's largest, covers much of the northeast.\n\nThe island has long made it of interest to many other countries for military purposes and as a source of natural resources, from rare minerals to natural gas and oil.\n\nBut to Greenlanders, it's simply home.\n\nPre-Inuit groups, including members of the Saqqaq culture, came to the island around 2,500 BCE via Canada. They settled in northern, western, and southeastern Greenland. Today's Greenland Inuit population is descended from the Thule people, who moved into the country's north from Alaska through Canada around 1,000 years ago.\n\nBetween 985 and roughly 1450 CE, Vikings lived and then died out in Western Greenland. Erik the Red was the one who called the icy island Greenland. In Greenlandic, its name is Kalaallit Nunaat.\n\nDanish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede established a settlement in what's now Nuuk, Greenland's capital, in 1721. Over the centuries, Denmark's culture profoundly changed the country.\n\nGreenland remained a Danish colony until 1953 and became an autonomous territory in 1979. It has its own parliament, known as the Inatsisartut.\n\nWhile the country self-governs its domestic matters, Denmark retains jurisdiction over defense and foreign affairs.\n\nAround 56,000 people make Greenland their home.\n\nJust under 90% are Inuit, though most also have some European ancestry, according to genetic testing published by the American Society of Human Genetics in 2015. Danish people make up the rest of the population. Most live in coastal cities or communities.\n\nKalaallisut, also known as Greenlandic, is an Inuit language and is the official language of the country. It's widely spoken, though some groups in the east speak Tunumiit, according to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs.\n\nMost residents also speak Danish, which is taught as a second language in schools.\n\nThe population has long depended on fishing for their livelihoods. However, it's not enough to support the entire country. Denmark heavily supplements its budget with about $511 million annually, according to The BBC.\n\n\"The economy has been difficult,\" Stenbaek said. Tourism and the country's natural resources may be its future.\n\nWhether they're hoping to spot narwhals or want to glimpse glaciers, nature-loving tourists are drawn to Greenland.\n\nFor a long time, it was difficult to get to the island by plane. Nuuk only opened its international airport in November 2024. Before that, only a few airports had runways long enough to land large jets. But as of earlier this year, Americans can hop on a direct flight from New York to Nuuk.\n\nIlulissat, which has an ice fjord on UNESCO's World Heritage list, and Qaqortoq are also getting international airports, Reuters reported.\n\nTo get ready for the surge of tourists, some residents are buying snowmobiles to rent out, The New York Times reported. New hotels are opening, too.\n\nGreenland has a history of mining cryolite, which is used in aluminum smelting. A recent documentary, \"The White Gold of Greenland,\" claimed that for over 100 years, Danish mining companies extracted billions worth of the mineral, and Greenland reaped very little of the benefit, Variety reported.\n\nThat's not a history it would want to repeat if it taps its deposits of uranium, gold, natural gas, lithium, and other resources. While some see mining as an opportunity to enrich the country, others have concerns.\n\n\"Greenlanders are very hesitant about many aspects of mining because it impacts the nature so much,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nThere are also worries about how it could affect the fishing industry, while residents in Narsaq are concerned about their health if a company moves forward with mining radioactive uranium at a nearby proposed site, The Guardian reported.\n\nDanish culture is visible in Greenland's healthcare system, educational institutions, and government. \"To that extent, it has had a huge impact,\" Stenbaek said. At the same time, authorities contributed to the loss of many aspects of the Inuits' way of life.\n\nBetween the 1950s and '70s, the Danish government forced Inuit populations to relocate from smaller settlements and communities to cities, Reuters reported. During this time, doctors implanted IUDs in thousands of Inuit girls and women, sometimes without their consent, The BBC reported. Denmark is investigating the matter and has offered counseling to those affected, AP reported last year.\n\nMembers of the Inuit community were also pressured to give up their culture and language.\n\n\"We were told to act more Danish, to speak Danish, if we wanted to be something,\" Nadja Arnaaraq Kreutzmann, a Nuuk resident, recently told Reuters.\n\nFrom sewing national costumes to making jewelry to carving animal tusks, Inuit people in Greenland are finding ways to continue traditional practices.\n\n\"I'm concerned if we do not give the old traditions to younger people, it'll die out within 35 years,\" Greenlander Vera Mølgaard told National Geographic.\n\nQupanuk Olsen, a new member of Greenland's Parliament, has spent over five years gaining more than 320,000 Instagram followers by highlighting the country's food and traditions.\n\nSome estimates put Greenland's Lutheran population at 90%, heavily influenced by Hans Egede, the missionary who came to the island in 1721. His statue stands in Nuuk, and some want it removed, saying it's a symbol of the start of colonization, the AP reported.\n\nMany Greenlanders incorporate traditional religious practices into their services, Stenbaek said. They also sing hymns in Greenlandic, she said.\n\nThe city's architecture is Scandinavian, but its artwork incorporates Inuit tales, according to Lonely Planet. That duality is Nuuk in a nutshell.\n\n\"It's very much, in many ways, like a modern Scandinavian city,\" Stenbaek said. \"And at the same time, the Greenlandic culture, the traditional culture, is still there.\"\n\nThere are plenty of cafés, restaurants, and shopping for residents and tourists to visit.\n\nSmall settlements remain along the west and east coasts, Stenbaek said. Some have fewer than 100 people.\n\n\"They live very much like they would have lived 100 years ago,\" Stenbaek said. That means relying on fishing and other traditional knowledge to survive.\n\nIn the more remote areas of the country, it's not always easy to get from place to place.\n\n\"If you have to go from settlement to settlement, it's either by boat or dog sleigh or skiing,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nIf the water is too icy for boats, Greenlanders might have to jump in a helicopter. There are dog sled races in Uummannaq, but it's also a practical mode of transportation in the snowy weather. The same goes for snowmobiles.\n\nFar north regions experience polar nights in the winter, when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon. The opposite happens in the summer, when Greenland gets nonstop daylight for a couple of months.\n\nBoth are significant to Greenlanders.\n\nSince the sun is not visible in the winter, when spring comes it brings life back,\" photographer Inuuteq Storch told The Guardian in 2024. \"That time of total darkness is very spiritual.\"\n\nGreenland is a maritime culture, according to Stenbaek. \"Everything depends on ice and water,\" she said.\n\nIn some parts of the country, winters can last through April. The temperatures can be frigid, with some regions getting down to -30 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSummers in northern towns are still chilly, averaging around 41 degrees Fahrenheit, per The Guardian. Temperatures are getting warmer, though.\n\nPlenty of Greenlanders' pastimes involve braving the cold.\n\n\"Many of them are connected directly to nature, like fishing, hunting, skiing,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nThe snowy landscape and arctic waters surrounding the island are habitats for musk ox, reindeer, seals, polar bears, whales, and dozens of bird species.\n\nBerries, flowers, and cottongrass also grow in some parts of the country.\n\nSled dogs aren't just companions. They're often working animals, and have a long history of surviving alongside humans. Greenland's first dogs arrived with the Thule people hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe husky-like dogs have thick coats, muscular bodies for pulling sleds, and a digestive system suited to high-fat diets, as reported by Newsweek.\n\nSome dog sled races ban the use of other breeds, according to the Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nLong before there were grocery stores in Greenland, locals survived by hunting and fishing. Since the island doesn't have a lot of plant life, they got their vitamin C from whale skin, The New York Times reported.\n\nEven today, there isn't much farming in Greenland, though people do raise sheep in the south.\n\nWhile supermarkets sell imported food, like milk and vegetables, they'll also stock local fare, including fish, seal, and whale. Some Greenlanders also supplement their shopping by hunting reindeer, ox, and other animals.\n\n\"In Greenland, we have the world's wildest kitchen,\" chef Inunnguaq Hegelund recently told NPR.\n\nAs the planet heats up, Greenland has started to melt. Its glaciers are shrinking, and the permafrost is disappearing. In 2016, researchers found that the Greenland ice sheet was losing the equivalent of 110 million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water each year.\n\n\"It had an influence on roads and airports and houses when all of a sudden the earth starts to unfreeze,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nIt's started to change animals' migration patterns, and polar bears have had to adapt to a new way of hunting without sea ice.\n\nThe US National Science Foundation has been studying Greenland's ice sheet for decades.\n\nThe country's location also makes it the perfect location to obtain ice cores, test cold-weather engineering, monitor climate change, and study the elusive Greenland shark.\n\nOver the years, Greenland has become increasingly independent from Denmark. In 2008, it voted for a referendum granting them more autonomy. Many want to go even further and become completely independent from the Danish kingdom.\n\nAbout 80% of Greenlanders support the move, according to recent polling. Yet one longtime backer of the movement has recently become a bit more hesitant.\n\nAqqaluk Lynge is the former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, a nongovernmental organization representing Inuit people in several countries. He told NPR in February 2025 that he now supports Greenland staying tied to Denmark because \"if Greenland secedes from Denmark, it will be taken by United States.\"\n\n\"This is surprising because Aqqaluk used to be head of much of the independence movement,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to buy Greenland. In a speech to the US Congress earlier this year, he said that if Greenland chose to join, \"we welcome you into the United States of America.\"\n\nIt may be one of the reasons the Democratic party, which advocates for a slow approach to independence, won in recent elections, Stenbaek said. The majority of Greenlanders, 85%, according to a January 2025 opinion poll, don't want to become part of the US.\n\n\"Greenlanders want to remain Greenlandic,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nShe said she thought it was important for Greenland to strengthen connections with other countries, Canada in particular. They have a lot in common in terms of environmental concerns and large Inuit populations, she said.\n\n\"Both are Arctic countries,\" she said. \"They would be quite strong.\"",

    "description": "Economist Mark Zandi isn't convinced the big Q3 GDP report means the economy is set to soar from here, and thinks the data could be revised lower.",
    "fullText": "The third-quarter GDP report was a blowout, but don't expect that to change Mark Zandi's mind about how the economy is faring.\n\nAfter a long delay due to the government shutdown, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the latest economic growth data, and it was a lot more upbeat than economists were predicting.\n\nAccording to the Q3 report, the US economy is estimated to have expanded at a 4.3% growth rate during the three-month period, driven by robust consumer and federal spending.\n\nYet, Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, tells Business Insider that he's still harboring reservations about how things are going under the surface.\n\nZandi has been ringing the alarm on the economy all year, recently stating that he saw the US on the edge of a recession.\n\nThe most recent GDP report doesn't seem to have restored his confidence that better days are ahead.\n\n\"Despite the big gain in real GDP growth in the quarter, underlying real GDP growth — abstracting from the quarterly vagaries of the data — is closer to 2%,\" he told Business Insider. \"OK, but not great, and not strong enough to create enough jobs, as unemployment is steadily moving higher.\"\n\nZandi was predicting a 3.8% increase in real GDP growth, higher than most economists' estimates of 3.3%. As such, he isn't surprised by the numbers, although he also speculated that the big upside surprise may have been driven by technical quirks as opposed to actual momentum.\n\n\"The biggest difference with my forecast is the more substantial narrowing of the trade deficit, but this is due to the swings caused by the tariffs. Government spending was also stronger, but this is likely due to a measurement issue,\" he said.\n\nZandi believes that the government shutdown also increases the risk of revision for the Q3 report, with growth potentially being revised downward in the coming months.\n\n\"I can't explicitly connect the dots from the government shutdown, its impact on the government data, and on the GDP estimate,\" Zandi said, \"But it wouldn't be surprising if this data is ultimately revised to a significant degree.\"",

    "description": "AI transformation, workforce strategy, and new job roles are reshaping how companies like ServiceNow and Weber Shandwick operate today.",
    "fullText": "This article is part of the \"How AI is Changing Talent\" series, which explores how AI is reshaping hiring, development, and retention.\n\nTwelve months ago, Jacqui Canney was ServiceNow's chief people officer, focused on talent strategy. Today, she's also the company's chief AI enablement officer — a title that didn't exist until recently.\n\nThe two roles aren't separate, Canney told Business Insider. \"They're one strategy, and the companies that understand that are going to be the winners.\"\n\nThat shift, though, requires letting go of how most organizations have always structured work: by function, head count, and department. \"Companies can't treat this as 'We're going to run an AI program over here, and it'll add capacity,'\" she says.\n\nInstead, they need to ask: how does AI change the work across departments? \"AI doesn't follow the same silos people do. That's why you build the workforce around the new workflow.\"\n\nCanney's approach isn't an outlier. Rather, it's a signal of how quickly AI has become part of work and our daily lives.\n\nThree years after the launch of ChatGPT, adoption has reached 54.6%. That's staggering compared to adoption rates for personal computers (19.7%) and the internet (30.1%) three years after they were widely introduced, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nMeanwhile, about 21% of US workers say that at least some of their job is now done with AI, an increase from 16% roughly a year ago, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nAI is transforming everything about work, from the jobs people do to how they do them. Organizations, meanwhile, are racing to prepare their people for what comes next. While the long-term impact remains uncertain, early patterns are emerging about what's working and what isn't.\n\nAI's effect on the labor market is showing up everywhere: in how companies screen candidates, which skills command premium salaries, and how performance gets evaluated. Two structural shifts, in particular, stand out: new jobs are emerging, and old jobs are evolving.\n\nAn authoritative count of new AI-specific job titles is hard to come by, but data show rapid growth. A report from software company Autodesk found that demand for roles like AI engineer jumped 143.2% in 2024, while prompt engineer rose 135.8%, and AI content creator increased 134.5%. Meanwhile, the number of jobs requiring AI skills rose 7.5% last year, even as total job postings fell 11.3%, according to research from consultancy PwC.\n\nMolly Roenna, global chief people officer at PR firm Weber Shandwick, sees this firsthand. Her company is increasingly seeking specialists in areas like AI integration and AI ethics, and it's recruiting from disciplines like behavioral science and data analytics.\n\n\"We're hiring for a fundamentally different environment,\" Roenna says. \"Meeting client expectations requires people who use technology as a force multiplier for insight and creativity, not just a shortcut for efficiency.\"\n\nThe hiring process itself has evolved, too. Many of Weber Shandwick's interviews now include a \"technology conversation,\" a practice that appears to be gaining traction. This isn't to test technical skills, but to gauge how candidates use AI.\n\n\"What have they built with AI? What excites or worries them about it? We want perspective that comes from actual practice.\"\n\nThe dynamic playing out at Weber Shandwick and elsewhere isn't new. After all, every major technological advancement has created roles that were previously unimaginable, made others obsolete, and forced still others to adapt. What's different about this AI-driven era, however, is both the speed of change (see above) and the breadth, affecting workers across industries and skill levels.\n\n\"We didn't have programmers before computers,\" says Esteve Almirall Mezquita, professor of data, analytics, technology and AI at Esade in Madrid.\n\nCreating new roles and demand for expertise is half the equation. The bigger challenge is helping existing workers figure out how to use AI.\n\nSome companies aren't leaving that to chance. They're requiring it, notes Dan Schawbel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, a research firm. \"CEOs are under enormous pressure to have their AI story intact,\" he says. \"We have to have our workers using AI. It's good for productivity, yes, but also our story and bottom line.\"\n\nCompanies such as Microsoft, Coinbase, and Shopify now mandate AI use, according to previous reporting by Business Insider. Meta plans to measure employees' performance by their \"AI-driven impact.\"\n\nSchawbel predicts more scrutiny in the year ahead. Employees will need to function like data scientists, continuously proving their value, he says. \"Whether you're in marketing, IT, or HR, every action can be measured and tracked — and maybe even tied directly to your compensation.\"\n\nMeasuring AI use and seeing value from it are two different things, however. Even as organizations pour billions into the technology, results have been uneven.\n\nResearch by consulting firm BCG of more than 1,250 firms worldwide reports that 60% of companies are investing heavily in AI but seeing minimal returns. Meanwhile, only 5% have taken the step to restructure their operations around AI — and those companies are seeing significant revenue gains over everyone else.\n\nThe difference, the BCG research suggests, comes down to several factors. Successful companies have buy-in from the top and have redesigned how work gets done. Most importantly, says Alicia Pittman, BCG's global people chair, they've invested in teaching employees to use AI effectively.\n\nPittman notes that industries like financial services, insurance, and healthcare are pulling ahead in AI adoption. \"We're seeing companies put real time and energy into this in a way that hasn't been present before, and that's good for everybody and good for the global workforce.\"\n\nGranted, there's job displacement that comes with that and some skill sets will go away, she says. \"But helping people adapt to AI is a major investment in them as professionals.\"\n\nAt Moody's, the credit ratings firm, that investment involves encouraging employees to teach AI as much as possible.\n\nAri Lehavi, who runs applied AI there, says this approach frees employees to focus on complex work that requires human expertise.\n\nTake sales, for example. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems can capture basics like company size, contract history, and revenue potential. However, they miss what closes deals: company politics, individual motivations, and who really influences decisions. Lehavi's team teaches AI systems to learn those details so salespeople can concentrate on managing relationships.\n\n\"They can spend their time on things they're already doing but don't have enough time for,\" he says. \"The hard cases, the edge cases, the complex situations, mentoring other people, management, and skill development.\"\n\nIn other words: the human stuff.\n\nOf course, the path forward isn't simple or straightforward. Not every company has the resources to retrain its workforce, and some jobs will indeed disappear. Many companies are struggling to make AI work.\n\nYet, Canney of ServiceNow remains positive. \"It's a human renaissance,\" she says. \"You're going to have capacity in your workforce and the chance to guide it toward new revenue streams or creative ways of working. It's an enormous opportunity, and I'm definitely an optimist about it.\"",

Despite that conviction, JPMorgan has been ordered to pay the legal bills of its former executive.\n\nJPMorgan, which has already covered some $60 million in legal expenses for Javice, is now asking a Delaware Court of Chancery judge to relieve it of an additional $18 million in expenses.\n\nIt argued that Javice and her attorneys have abused the advancement system by running up excessive and improper legal expenses.

    "fullText": "Getting a new phone is a great way to start the new year, especially if it's one of Apple's latest iPhone models. But why get an upgrade for just yourself when you can upgrade the entire family in one go? T-Mobile's current holiday deal makes it worthwhile by handing out four free iPhone 17s when you open four new lines on its Essentials 4 Line Plan.\n\nT-Mobile's Essentials Plan is already one of the best cell phone plans we've ever tested for those looking to open multiple lines on a budget, so we highly recommend it at any time. But with four free iPhones to sweeten the deal, it's a particularly good time to switch.\n\nNot only does T-Mobile's current deal get you a suite of the most sophisticated iPhones yet for free, but it also gets you an excellent service plan. Compared to other major carriers like Verizon and AT&T, T-Mobile's phone plans offer the best value for their quality, especially if you're opening multiple lines, like in this promotion.\n\nFor more on plan offerings, coverage, and speeds, check out our full T-Mobile review.\n\nIt's worth noting that you won't be getting the four phones for free up front. You'll earn back the cost of the devices via 24 monthly billing credits, which means you'll be locked into a two-year contract with T-Mobile before the phones are officially paid off. You'll also have to pay a $35 activation fee for each device. Still, this is less of a commitment compared to other carriers, which typically lock you into a 36-month contract for this type of deal. It's certainly a small price to pay for upgrades for the whole family.\n\nIf you don't need a new phone, you can still upgrade to T-Mobile's network. The carrier is also running a promotion that gets new customers up to $800 back when they keep their current phone and switch to T-Mobile from another carrier. Learn \n\nThe terms and conditions can be hard to follow for these phone carrier deals, so we're breaking down exactly how to get your free phones. Here are the steps to follow.\n\nT-Mobile's four free iPhone 17s promotion isn't the only one the carrier is running ahead of the holidays. If you're on the hunt for a Samsung or Google smartphone, a different iPhone model, a smartwatch, or even a tablet, there's a deal for you. Explore some of T-Mobile's current promotions below.",

    "description": "In her new docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" 36-year-old Taylor Swift says she feels \"very depressed\" about pop culture's obsession with youth.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift didn't expect her career to get this big. Just ask Taylor Swift.\n\nIn the sixth and final episode of her new Disney+ docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" Swift reflects on the unprecedented success of the Eras Tour, which traversed 21 countries and grossed over $2 billion by the end of its two-year run.\n\n\"This tour will live on as probably the pinnacle, foremost, important thing that I've done,\" she tells the camera.\n\n\"I get very depressed about pop culture's obsession with youth culture,\" Swift continues. \"We designate extremely young people to be the ones who have to tell us where culture is going, and the idea that an artist had, in my case, the privilege of developing — to the point where you're in your 30s and you know yourself a bit more, and then you were able to make the thing that they'll know you for. There's something very special about that.\"\n\nSwift was days away from turning 35 when the Eras Tour concluded on December 8, 2024 — the same age that Swift once believed would be her ceiling as a pop star.\n\nThe 2019 Netflix documentary, \"Miss Americana,\" focused on the creation and rollout of Swift's seventh album, \"Lover,\" which was released when she was 29. In one particularly memorable scene, Swift discusses her age in relation to her stardom.\n\n\"It's a lot to process because we do exist in this society where women in entertainment are discarded in an elephant graveyard by the time they're 35,\" she says. \"Everyone's a shiny new toy for like, two years. The female artists that I know of have reinvented themselves 20 times more than the male artists. They have to. Or else you're out of a job.\"\n\n\"This is probably one of my last opportunities as an artist to grasp onto that kind of success,\" she continues. \"As I'm reaching 30, I'm like, I wanna work really hard while society is still tolerating me being successful.\"\n\nSwift helped popularize the idea of albums as \"eras,\" a concept that describes the synergy between songs, music videos, outfits, performances, and marketing choices to curate an immersive experience for fans.\n\nSwift has continued to use this strategy well after \"Lover,\" adopting new aesthetics and alter-egos for albums like \"Folklore\" (2020), \"Midnights\" (2022), and \"The Tortured Poets Department\" (2024).\n\nWith the Eras Tour, Swift tried something different: Rewinding the clock. Each segment of the set list was framed around a different album from Swift's catalog, dating back to her 2008 sophomore release, \"Fearless.\" The segments were each embellished with distinctive costumes that recalled what Swift wore at the time of the album's release.\n\nSwift designed the tour to celebrate her past as much as her present, a significant shift from her mindset expressed in \"Miss Americana,\" when she described her job as \"constantly finding new facets of yourself that people find to be shiny.\"\n\nSwift's fans welcomed her nostalgic turn with open arms, packing stadiums worldwide to watch her perform three-plus hours of songs, some of which were over a decade old. According to the singer's production company, Taylor Swift Touring, over 10 million people attended the Eras Tour.\n\nSwift's latest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" was largely written and recorded during the European leg of the tour in 2024. In episode five of \"The End of an Era,\" Swift says the album's sound was inspired by the feeling of the tour itself: \"so romantic, and magical, and passionate,\" and \"full of possibility.\"\n\nFull of possibility, indeed. \"Showgirl\" sold over 4 million copies in its debut week — the biggest album sales week of all time. Through the rest of the year (and through Swift's 36th birthday), it has continued to dominate the Billboard 200.\n\nTo say that society is still tolerating Swift's success would be quite an understatement — a fact that would've likely stunned Swift in her late 20s.\n\n\"This was a seismic, momentous period of time in my life, and in the lives of the performers and the crew members and anyone who this tour touched,\" Swift says of the Eras Tour in her docuseries. \"It's never gonna happen again this way.\" Still, knowing Swift, surpassing former standards of success is never out of the question.",

    "title": "What Is VO2max?",
    "description": "It measures your cardio fitness, but it's not as important as tech companies want you to think.",
    "fullText": "The more you work out, the fitter you'll get. Your VO2max, sometimes described on wearables as a \"cardio fitness\" score, is a number that tends to be higher among people who are more cardiovascularly fit. But it's not the only measure of fitness, and you should know what it really means.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers don't actually measure VO2max; they just estimate it. To actually find your VO2max, you'd need to go to an exercise lab and do a test on a treadmill or cycle while hooked up to equipment that measures your heart rate and the air you're exhaling. I did exactly this kind of test to compare my real VO2max to the numbers reported by nine different devices. You can read about my experience, and why it matters, here.\n\nVO2max, properly rendered VO2max, is the maximal volume (V) of oxygen (O2) your body can use per minute during exercise, scaled to your body size because larger people will naturally use more oxygen. This is considered a good measure of aerobic fitness because—think back to high school biology—your body uses oxygen and food to create a usable form of chemical energy called ATP. You then use that ATP to power the movements of your muscles. The amount of oxygen directly correlates with the amount of energy produced. Or, in simpler terms, the more work you do, the more oxygen you need.\n\nSo a person who is aerobically very fit—let’s say an elite marathon runner—can do more work (run faster) than somebody who isn’t. As a result, they’ll suck in a lot more oxygen per minute during their run than, say, I would.\n\nA typical sorta-fit human being will have a VO2max somewhere in the 30s or 40s. If you exercise a lot, you can push that number higher. Elite cyclists, skiers, and ultrarunners may have numbers in the 70s or 80s, and a few people out there have scored in the 90s. I'd call myself a recreational athlete (I run a little) and my lab-tested VO2max was 43. Most of my fitness wearables reported numbers for me in the high 30's or low 40's—a good reminder that these estimates can be useful, but they aren't necessarily correct.\n\nTo be able to use a large amount of oxygen, you need more than just good lungs. You also need a strong heart and healthy circulatory system to get the oxygen to your muscles. And you need muscles that are large and can do a lot of work per minute—which means that you're strong and can do a lot of work athletically. VO2max is a way to summarize a lot of important things about cardio fitness into one simple number.\n\nBut it’s important to know that this number isn’t everything about fitness, or even aerobic fitness. First, it doesn’t make much sense to compare your VO2max to other people’s, because it’s affected by factors like blood volume and muscle mass. Men tend to have a VO2max about ten points higher than similarly fit women, for example. There are also plenty of aspects of fitness that aren't captured by VO2max. Compare two athletes with the same VO2max, and you may find that one can keep going in an endurance race longer than the other. Or one might be better at sprinting while another is better at medium-effort work. One person may be stronger than another, or have better technique, or be more resistant to injuries.\n\nThere is research correlating VO2max with longevity, but that doesn't mean that raising your VO2max a few points will add years to your life. Fitness, in general, tends to correlate with longevity and with overall health. Scientists who want to study that relationship will usually pick an easy thing or two to measure, like VO2max or grip strength. But in real life, we don't have to choose one number to maximize; we can work on multiple aspects of fitness. It's better to be well-rounded than to hyperfocus on just one metric.\n\nThe gold standard is a lab test. High-level athletes will sometimes take this test if they or their coach want to know their actual, definite VO2max number. But we can measure aerobic fitness in other ways, and there are workouts you can do to get a good estimate of VO2max. If you’re a runner, you can look up a recent race time on this chart to find your VDOT, which roughly correlates with your VO2max. (My best-ever mile time gets me a VDOT of 38, for example.)\n\nTo estimate your VO2max from a workout, you need something that will take you to your absolute maximum aerobic output. A race does this job nicely; so will a test like running as many laps of a track as you can in 12 minutes. I recall doing a test in a Phys Ed. class once where we had to step up and down from a high box as many times as possible. These tests aren’t pleasant, but their results can be a benchmark to tell you whether you’re improving your fitness over time.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers typically estimate VO2max by comparing your heart rate during exercise to a measure of how much work you're doing during that exercise. Most often, this is through outdoor running or walking. The speed you run or walk is measured through GPS, and the device compares that to your heart rate. If you can run fast with a low heart rate, you must be pretty fit and your VO2max will be estimated as being pretty high. If your heart rate is high even for a slow running or walking pace, your VO2max is lower.\n\nThese estimates aren't always accurate. If your max heart rate isn't set properly in the device's settings, if it's hot out, if your running route has hills, or if you don't happen to get out for outdoor runs or walks very often, your VO2max is more likely to be wrong. That said, your VO2max estimate doesn't have to be exactly correct to be useful. If the number increases over time, you're probably getting fitter. And if it decreases, you're likely losing fitness.",

Bevel can give you advice about how recovered it thinks you are, and how your habits affect your health metrics. While the Apple Watch can collect a lot of data, Apple has never built an app that integrates everything in a friendly, easily readable way.\n\nThat integrated dashboard is where Apple Watch competitors like Whoop and Oura shine, and using Bevel (or one of its competitors, like Athlytic) gives a similar experience.\n\nAccording to announcements Bevel made on Instagram and Reddit, an update rolling out this week makes all features of Bevel free except Bevel Intelligence, their AI feature. The company says this is because AI is more expensive for it to provide.

Bevel collects data from almost any health app that links to Apple Health, and can track a multitude of metrics, including strength training by muscle group, cardio load, recovery scores, and habit tracking. Most other wearables collect this information in their own apps, but if you wear an Apple Watch, Bevel is one of the best ways to consolidate it all.",

    "title": "Google 2025 recap: Research breakthroughs of the year",
    "description": "This year saw new AI models, transformative products and new breakthroughs in science and robotics.",
    "fullText": "This was a year of AI agents, reasoning and scientific discovery.\n\n2025 has been a year of extraordinary progress in research. With artificial intelligence, we can see its trajectory shifting from a tool to a utility: from something people use to something they can put to work. If 2024 was about laying the multimodal foundations for this era, 2025 was the year AI began to really think, act and explore the world alongside us. With quantum computing, we made progress towards real-world applications. And across the board, we helped turn research into reality, with more capable and useful products and tools making a positive impact on people's lives today.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the breakthroughs, products and scientific milestones that defined the work of Google, Google DeepMind and Google Research in a year of relentless progress.\n\nThis year, we significantly advanced our model capabilities with breakthroughs on reasoning, multimodal understanding, model efficiency, and generative capabilities, beginning with the release of Gemini 2.5 in March and culminating in the November launch of Gemini 3 and the December launch of Gemini 3 Flash.\n\nBuilt on a foundation of state-of-the-art reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro is our most powerful model to date, designed to help you bring any idea to life. It topped the LMArena Leaderboard and redefined multimodal reasoning with breakthrough scores on benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam — a fiendishly hard test for AI models to see if AI can truly think and reason like humans — and GPQA Diamond. It also set a new standard for frontier models in mathematics, achieving a new state-of-the-art of 23.4% on MathArena Apex. We followed shortly with Gemini 3 Flash, which combines Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost, making it the most performant model for its size. Gemini 3 Flash's quality surpasses our previous Gemini 2.5 Pro-scale model's capabilities at a fraction of the price and substantially better latency, continuing our Gemini-era trend of 'the next generation's Flash model is better than the previous generation's Pro model'.\n\nLearn more about our progress on our world-class AI models this year:\n\nGemini 3 Flash price & benchmark table.\n\nWe’re committed to making useful AI technology accessible, with state-of-the-art open models. We built our Gemma family of models to be lightweight and open for public use; this year we were able to introduce multimodal capabilities, significantly increase the context window, expand multilingual capabilities, and improve efficiency and performance.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances in Gemma models:\n\nThroughout 2025, we continued to advance the trajectory of AI from tool to utility, transforming our portfolio of products with new, powerful agentic capabilities. We reimagined software development by moving beyond tools that assist coding to introducing powerful, agentic systems that collaborate with developers. Key advances, such as the impressive coding capabilities in Gemini 3 and the launch of Google Antigravity, mark a new era in AI-assisted software development.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances building developer tools:\n\nThis evolution was also clear across our core products, from AI-enabled features on the Pixel 10 and updates to AI Mode in Search, to AI-first innovations like the Gemini app and NotebookLM, which gained advanced features like Deep Research.\n\nLearn more about how we’ve transformed our products with AI:\n\n2025 was a transformative year for generative media, giving people new and unprecedented capabilities to realize their creative ambitions. Generative media models and tools for video, images, audio and worlds became more effective and broadly used, with breakouts Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro offering unprecedented capabilities for native image generation and editing. We worked with people in creative industries to develop tools like Flow and Music AI Sandbox, making them more helpful for creative workflows, and we expanded creative possibilities for people with new, AI-powered experiences in the Google Arts & Culture lab, major upgrades to image editing within the Gemini app, and the introduction of powerful new generative media models like Veo 3.1, Imagen 4 and Flow.\n\nLearn more about how we’re building AI to enhance creativity:\n\nAs research breakthroughs continue to expand AI’s capabilities, Google Labs is where we share AI experiments as we develop them – hearing from users and evolving as we learn. Some of this year’s most engaging experiments from Labs: Pomelli, an AI experiment for on-brand marketing content; Stitch, which introduced a way to turn prompt and image inputs into complex UI designs and frontend code in minutes; Jules, an asynchronous coding agent that acts as a collaborative partner for developers; and Google Beam, a 3D video communications platform that used AI to advance the possibilities of remote presence.\n\nLearn more about how we’re experimenting in Labs:\n\n2025 was also a banner year for scientific advances with AI, marked by breakthroughs in life sciences, health, natural sciences, and mathematics.\n\nIn the space of a year, we made progress in building AI resources and tools that empower researchers and help them understand, identify, and develop treatments in healthcare. In genomics, where we’ve been applying advanced technology to research for 10 years, we moved beyond sequencing, using AI to interpret the most complex data. We also marked the 5-year anniversary of AlphaFold, the Nobel-winning AI system that solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem. AlphaFold has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to advance life sciences and health:\n\nGemini’s advanced thinking capabilities, including Deep Think, also enabled historic progress in mathematics and coding. Deep Think was able to solve problems that require deep abstract reasoning – achieving gold medal-standard in two international contests.\n\nLearn more about how we’re advancing natural sciences and mathematics:\n\nWe’re also leading major discoveries and shaping the future of science in areas like quantum computing, energy and moonshots. Research in this area drew new levels of public attention, with progress towards real-world applications of quantum computing as demonstrated by Quantum Echoes and, notably, Googler Michel Devoret becoming a 2025 Physics Nobel Laureate along with former Googler John Martinis and UC Berkeley’s John Clarke, for their foundational 1980s quantum research.\n\nLearn more about our work on space infrastructure and quantum computing:\n\nIn 2025, we continued to advance the core infrastructure that powers our AI, focusing on breakthroughs in hardware design and improving energy efficiency. This included the introduction of Ironwood, a new TPU built for the age of inference, which was designed using a method called AlphaChip, alongside a commitment to measuring the environmental impact of our technology.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to develop chips, infrastructure and improve energy efficiency:\n\nOur work in robotics and visual understanding brought AI agents into both the physical and virtual worlds, with advancements like the foundational Gemini Robotics models, the more sophisticated Gemini Robotics 1.5, and the introduction of Genie 3 as a new frontier for general-purpose world models.\n\nLearn more about our work with world models and robotics:\n\nOur work throughout 2025 demonstrates how AI-enabled scientific progress is being directly applied to address the world's most critical and pervasive challenges. By leveraging state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning, we are significantly increasing our understanding of the planet and its systems, while also delivering impactful solutions in areas vital to human flourishing, including climate resilience, public health and education.\n\nFor example, we are using state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning to help increase our understanding of the planet, helping enable work that is making a difference in people’s lives now from weather predictions to urban planning to public health. For example, our flood forecasting information now covers more than two billion people in 150 countries for severe riverine floods. And our most advanced and efficient forecasting model, WeatherNext 2 can generate forecasts 8x faster and with resolution up to 1-hour. Using this technology, we’ve supported weather agencies in making decisions based on a range of scenarios through our experimental cyclone predictions.\n\nLearn more about our work in weather, mapping and wildfires:\n\nWe are working with partners to apply AI-enabled scientific progress closer to patients, opening up new avenues for disease management and therapeutic discovery.\n\nLearn more about our health-related work:\n\nAI is proving to be a powerful tool in education, enabling new forms of understanding and expanding curiosity through initiatives like LearnLM and Guided Learning in Gemini. We brought Gemini’s most powerful translation capabilities to Google Translate, enabling much smarter, more natural and accurate translations and piloting new speech to speech translation capabilities.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to enable learning:\n\nWe couple our research breakthroughs with rigorous and forward-looking work on responsibility and safety. As our models grow more capable, we’re continuing to advance and evolve our tools, resources and safety frameworks to anticipate and mitigate risk. Gemini 3 demonstrated this approach in action: it's our most secure model yet, and has undergone the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date. And we’re looking further ahead, exploring a responsible path to AGI, prioritizing readiness, proactive risk assessment, and collaboration with the wider AI community.\n\nLearn more about our responsibility and safety work:\n\nAdvancing the frontier of AI responsibly demands collaboration across all parts of society. In 2025, we worked with leading AI labs to help to form the Agentic AI Foundation and support open standards to ensure a responsible and interoperable future for agentic AI. In education, we’ve partnered with school districts like Miami Dade County and education groups like Raspberry Pi to equip students with AI skills. Our research partnerships with universities like UC Berkeley, Yale, the University of Chicago and many more have been instrumental to some of this year’s most exciting frontier research, and we’re working with the US Department of Energy’s 17 national laboratories to transform how scientific research is conducted. And we’re working with filmmakers and other creative visionaries to put the best AI tools in their hands and explore storytelling in the age of AI.\n\nLearn more about our work on frontier collaboration:\n\nAs we look towards 2026, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance the frontier, safely and responsibly, for the benefit of humanity.",

    "description": "Plug Power and Lucid could both be zeros.",
    "fullText": "Plug Power and Lucid both have negative gross margins and are burning through cash.\n\nPlug Power has a history of underdelivering.\n\nLucid's cash outflows this year will be extreme when compared to its market cap.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Plug Power ›\n\nIf you're betting big on Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) or Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID), you should probably think again. These are the type of stocks that could easily wipe away a $100,000 nest egg in the blink of an eye. Both companies have the strong potential to go bankrupt in the coming years, with the stocks going to zero.\n\nLet's take a close look at both stocks.\n\nPlug Power fancies itself as the next next-generation hydrogen fuel cell company, but its core business is actually providing fuel cells that go into forklifts and other material handling equipment. Fuel cell-powered forklifts are popular in high-volume warehouses and fulfillment centers that run 24/7, as operators just have to refuel the fuel cell and not recharge a battery. Meanwhile, the industry has moved away from gasoline-powered forklifts due to safety issues using them in an enclosed building.\n\nThis would seem to be a good business, but it has not been for Plug Power. The company also provides the hydrogen fuel to its customers, which it has long sold at a loss. To make matters worse, it has also been selling its equipment and infrastructure at a loss as well.\n\nTo try and change what is an uneconomical business model, Plug Power is in the process of building out a system of hydrogen plants to produce its own hydrogen to be able to sell at a profit. It's also undergoing a restructuring program and has looked to raise prices. However, thus far, the company is still producing negative gross margins and has both massive negative operating cash flow and free cash flow.\n\nWhile the company has pledged to get to break-even gross margins by next year, that would still not solve all its problems. Meanwhile, the company has a long history of not delivering on its projections.\n\nLucid's stock recently hit an all-time low, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have further to fall. Like Plug Power, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has negative gross margins and is bleeding cash. Just last quarter, it burnt through more than $950 million in cash, and it's gone through more than $2.5 billion in cash so far this year. Notably, the company's market cap is only around $3.7 billion, so this is extreme.\n\nLucid is betting big on its entry into the luxury EV SUV market with its Gravity model, which it thinks will complement its luxury sedan, Lucid Air. It's also looking to launch a cheaper midsize platform. However, the company isn't seeing the gross margin step-change that rival Rivian has seen when it switched to a zonal architecture that significantly reduced costs.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin woman who almost killed her sixth-grade classmate to please the fictional horror villain known as Slender Man was ordered back to a state psychiatric hospital Tuesday after she escaped from her group home last month.\n\nWaukesha County Circuit Judge K. Scott Wagner granted a state Department of Health Services request to revoke 23-year-old Morgan Geyser’s release privileges. Geyser told the judge through her attorney, Tony Cotton, last week that she would not fight revocation. Wagner then approved the request during a short hearing.\n\nCotton didn't immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.\n\nGeyser and her friend Anissa Weier lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a Waukesha park in 2014. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier cheered her on. A passing bicyclist discovered Leutner, who barely survived. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.\n\nGeyser and Weier later told investigators they attacked Leutner in hopes of impressing Slender Man enough that he would make them his servants and wouldn't hurt their families. Both of them were eventually committed to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute — Geyser for 40 years and Weier for 25 years.\n\nWeier earned conditional release in 2021. Wagner granted Geyser conditional release this past September despite warnings from state Department of Health Services officials that she couldn't be trusted.\n\nGeyser was placed in a Madison group home. Authorities say that on Nov. 22 she cut off her GPS monitor and fled the state with a 43-year-old companion. Police arrested both of them the next day at a truck stop outside Chicago, about 170 miles (274 kilometers) south of Madison.\n\nGeyser's companion told WKOW-TV that the two of them became friends at church and had been seeing each other daily for the last month. Geyser decided to escape because she was afraid the group home would no longer allow them to see each other, the companion said.\n\nSlender Man was created online by Eric Knudsen in 2009 as a mysterious figure photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He grew into a popular boogeyman, appearing in video games, online stories and a 2018 movie.",

For many players, a studio’s use of AI as a shortcut, instead of commissioning an artist, hiring a voice actor, or paying a writer to create assets for the final product, is something they actively don’t want to buy.\n\nSo this curated list that’s human-approved with only a spellchecker to assist in its creation will highlight the best games in 2025 where AI is, as far as we know, not involved in the development process. They all come from a whole bunch of developers, big and small, spanning a wide range of genres. The one thing they have in common is that a dedicated team of people worked on it without any assistance from GenAI tools.\n\nIt’s important to clarify that any procedural generation of maps, or randomized abilities or enemies, uses AI to determine what appears, and is not the same as GenAI. We’re specifically excluding games that use AI to generate any assets, whether it’s disclosed at the point of sale or found out after publishing. If it’s ethically problematic for any of these reasons, a game won’t be included on the list, no matter how much of a Game of the Year contender it is. With that, here are the best games without AI involvement in their development.\n\nHades 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Supergiant Games’ Game of the Year, which puts you in the shoes of the immortal Princess Melinoë as she attempts to save her father Hades and his kingdom from the time-looping clutches of the Titan Cronos. It largely follows a similar Roguelike structure, where each run has you collect powers from the Ancient Greek Pantheon to augment your chosen weapon and crush the foes in your way.\n\nOf course, with every sequel, you need to outdo what came before. Naturally, this means having two separate paths from the beginning, each with its own layout. One leads to the depths of Hades to Cronos, while the other has Melinoë ascend to the peak of Mt Olympus to defeat the invading monsters. Fans of the first will likely already have this one, but you don’t need to have mastered the original to enjoy everything that Hades 2 has to offer.\n\nReleased episodically, Dispatch is a wonderful throwback from the team behind The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. Throughout its first season, you are a former superhero, Mechaman, who becomes a dispatcher for a new generation of heroes. However, he ends up managing a team of miscreants who are easily sidetracked by a little bit of arson or petty theft. It’s up to you to keep everything on track, even when things go south.\n\nWhether it’s allocating the right person for a particular job or making sure another hero doesn’t get sidetracked, each chapter has significant decisions that drastically change the outcome of a mission. By reading each hero's bio and upgrading their skills, you’ll increase your chances of success. You’ll also occasionally need to hack into systems remotely to assist your heroes when they’re in peril.\n\nDispatch’s stunning cast, which includes professional voice actors and some YouTubers branching out and doing a decent job in bringing these larger-than-life characters to life. By the time you reach the end, only one question will likely be on your mind: when’s season 2?\n\nFor fans of retro beat-'em-ups such as Streets of Rage or Final Fight, it’s been quite a while since a brand-new series broke ground. Absolum carefully blends in Roguelike game mechanics to make what Steve Watts, in his review, described as “a match made in heaven”. You play as one of a band of rebel wizards led by Root Mother Uchawi, a benevolent god-like being, who attempts to take on the tyrant Sun King Azra and his Crimson Order army, who have taken over the world of Talamh.\n\nWith multiple characters to play with their own fighting style, a phenomenal soundtrack, stunning visuals, and a Hades-like elemental progression system for every run, it’s easy to see how this is a winning formula. On top of that, there are plenty of branching paths and hidden secrets to find along the way. Quests ask you to venture to specific points, but don’t always require that you reach them in the same run.\n\nSome may feel that the Roguelike structure holds it back because it doesn’t lean into it enough, but it instead asks for the player to master its mechanics by giving them familiar challenges, and as such, may be somewhat fairer to their time. If you’re not convinced, there’s a free Absolum demo you can check out that gives you a small slice of just how wonderfully everything comes together, and like the full-price experience, you can bring a friend with you in your quest to save the realm.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nSolving the mystery behind a weird house with constantly shifting layouts that you inherited was not exactly on our bingo card for 2025, but Blue Prince is one of the best puzzle games we’ve played in years. Each day, you have a set number of steps to explore a house with randomized rooms. These rooms can give or take away steps, grant you items, or even house escape room-like puzzles that reward you with more trinkets.\n\nOn top of this, Blue Prince has a rather intricate mystery throughout. Clues hidden in certain rooms will allude to the house itself, including what’s in room 46, the former owner Herbert S. Sinclair, and a children's author called Marion Marigold. It might take you only a few attempts, or it may take you many. If you find you’re struggling to make a dent, you should check out our Blue Prince guides hub for some tips. Persevere, and you’ll find out why it’s worth continuing until you find that fated room.\n\nNintendo’s big ape smashes his way onto the Switch 2 with Donkey Kong Bananza, from the creators of Super Mario Odyssey. Our gorilla hero travels to Ingot Isle to mine Banadium Gems, only to have his hoard stolen by a sinister simian syndicate known as VoidCo. Buried deep underground, DK soon finds an odd sentient rock that later turns out to be a younger version of Pauline. The two team up to excavate through each layer of this underground world to stop VoidCo.’s president from reaching the planet’s core.\n\nThe big selling point of Donkey Kong Bananza is that DK can dig his way through levels with his bare hands, uncovering secrets while using rocks and soil to bash his way to the end. Pauline’s singing also helps unlock transformations that enable DK to fly or charge at high speed, amongst others. Much like 3D Mario games and their equivalent macguffins, you’ll also gather crystal bananas for completing objectives. However, these bananas also tie in with the upgrade system that unlocks more powers for the duo.\n\nWhat sets it apart is that, despite being vastly different from every other Donkey Kong game, it manages to pay homage to the series. Cameos from DK’s animal friends, musical homages, and so much more. It’s one of the few essential games to own for the Nintendo Switch 2 in its first year on the market. In case you’re wondering, you can safely skip the DLC: DK Island and Emerald Rush unless it’s put on sale, or you really enjoy Roguelike modes.\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is a remaster made with love, care, and passion. Since the source code was lost, as was sadly the norm back in the 1990s, the effort made to bring the entire campaign to currently available platforms is staggering. It does have the newer translation, added voice acting, and support for higher resolutions than its PlayStation, PSP, or mobile iterations, and all of that is created or performed by talented people. And yet, despite the modern additions, it’s still the same punishing, yet charming, and above all, epic classic RPG from Square Enix’s golden age.\n\nIt would have been so easy just to churn out a ‘modern reskin’ of the classic permadeath game, or mangle its existing assets with generative AI upscaling tools. However, the team behind Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles evidently cared, wanting to retell the War of the Lions saga that captivated many with its twists and turns. Rebalancing encounters and adding the ability to skip non-story fights help ease newer players in, allowing them to experience some of what makes this tactical RPG so special.\n\nPeak is high up there when it comes to games with humble origins. It started as a Game Jam experiment that people loved so much that it inspired the developers, whose previous effort was the crustacean Soulslike game, Another Crab’s Treasure, to expand it into a full multiplayer experience. It’s one of the best Steam co-op games of the year, and that’s largely thanks to its tense gameplay and proximity-based voice chat.\n\nAs you ascend the biomes, you’ll encounter many dangerous obstacles such as toxic plants, chilling winds, and lava that rises and falls. Sometimes, you have mere seconds to cross perilous gaps, and sometimes it’s unclear if your constantly fatiguing scout can even make it until you try. Every major update adds a new environment filled with hazards, and new items make every run an unpredictable challenge.\n\nPlaying it with friends lets you share tools and food across your backpacks, and even grab a partner’s hand to reach the ledge they’re on. Once you’ve reached the top of the final level, you can begin tweaking runs with difficulty modifiers, which gives Peak a great amount of replay value. Whatever you do, though, don’t let the Scoutmaster see you if you split from the party.\n\nAs the name would suggest, Silent Hill f is not for the faint of heart. The latest in the horror game series takes place in the fictional town of Ebisugaoka in 1960s Japan, where the protagonist Hinako Shimizu finds her homeland shrouded in fog and infested with grotesque monsters intent on killing her and her childhood friends. It soon becomes apparent that all is not quite as it seems, as Hinako discovers an alternate dimension where she encounters a guide wearing a fox mask.\n\nTo survive, you’ll need to find and maintain gathered weapons while mastering both the focus attack and the timing of dodging enemy strikes. You’ll also solve puzzles with cryptic clues, all while the Silent Hill f tries its hardest to unsettle you. An early part taking place in a paddy field is particularly memorable, and it’s not even the game’s evilest trick.\n\nSilent Hill continues the series’ track record of weaving a tale within its enemy design, the documents and letters you find, and even item descriptions. All of which provide intricate clues as to what’s really happening. Some will probably find that one playthrough is enough for them, but persevere with subsequent playthroughs, and you’ll soon uncover more layers that need unravelling to get the next ending.\n\nFrom the people who brought you Before Your Eyes comes Goodnight Universe, a game with a great story where you interact telepathically with your surroundings as a 6-month-old baby. Having gained sentience moments before your grandfather’s death, Isaac soon has to contend with a world that doesn’t understand him. Your interpretation of everything that’s happening around you, or what you mean to your family, is soon complicated by symbols in his old book that you can somehow decipher.\n\nBefore long, you begin controlling things with your mind, from swiping dog food to tipping it over, spilling its contents into a dog bowl, to shunting the old mutt closer to the food, and that’s just one of the many telepathic scenarios you’ll encounter. It’s more of an interactive story than a game, but the writing and performances are what bring Goodnight Universe to life. The further in, the weirder things get as you discover more about the dormant powers Isaac has. By the end of this fairly short tale, you’ll likely shed a few tears, especially if you are a parent yourself.\n\nAs one of the few exclusively co-op games on the market, Lego Voyagers is a beautifully crafted journey where players control a red or blue Lego brick. After witnessing a rocket launch go wrong, and part of it washes up on their island, the two bricks set out to discover the wonders of the archipelago. It might be a little fiddly at first, but soon you’ll be crossing rivers with makeshift bridges, sliding down pipes, and constructing new methods to cross a gap or reach the top of a ledge with Lego pieces.\n\nLego Voyagers is fairly light in tone, nothing speaks, and its puzzles aren’t mind-numbingly easy, making it a perfect game for a parent and child to share. There are lots of things to just mess around with, bringing out the inner kid and satisfying that curiosity, while also sharing in the game’s more whimsical moments, such as sitting on a swing set to take in the scenery. It’s not the longest game on the list, coming in at only a couple of hours from start to finish, but this is the definition of an experience that’s short but sweet.\n\nThe best bit is that only one of you needs to own the Lego Voyagers for you to play with a buddy, thanks to the Friends Pass. It also now has full crossplay, which you can use across any device despite previous announcements saying otherwise. You can even play with a buddy via the Friend Pass on a different console or PC from the one you are using.\n\nCabernet plays a lot like the social life part of a modern Persona game, but with a macabre twist. You are Liza, a newly turned vampire in a 19th-century Eastern European town, navigating her eternal life. Along the way, she’ll meet the locals, both human and vampire, with whom she’ll form bonds by sharing in passions of art, literature, science, and politics. Liza also has vampire powers she can use to manipulate those around her, should she choose to, but these usually come at a cost.\n\nFor us, it’s the level of choice that truly sets Cabernet apart from the crowd. Dialogue options not only appear based on friendship levels with the person you’re talking to, but can also require points in skills (which you can give a quick boost by wearing certain dresses) or by having more points one way or the other in the game’s morality system.\n\nIt’s also clear that Cabernet doesn’t get bogged down by its light RPG game mechanics. Instead, it focuses on telling a story with stellar writing, supported by its wide range of talented voices, bringing it to life. Compared to more combat-heavy RPGs, Cabernet offers a drastic change of pace, rewarding players who carefully plan their next moves and giving agency to their choices.\n\n2025 was a good year for kart racing games, and Sonic Racing: Crossworlds brings dimensional portals that alter the courses mid-race. One moment you’re speeding across a desert city, and the next you’re bouncing on alien plants, before returning to the original course for the final lap. Combined with Sonic All-Stars Racing: Transformed’s shifting vehicles from kart to plane to boat, depending on the terrain you’re racing on, this wacky racer is the perfect multiplayer game both online and locally. In fact, it has crossplay enabled across all platforms, so it’s far more accessible than its current competition.\n\nWhat’s more, the single-player offering is actually substantial. For every Grand Prix, you’re given a rival that you must try to beat on every track. Their behavior is more aggressive than that of other competitors, and the level of heat they have indicates their overall difficulty boost. Each race you win, outpace your rival, and collect all five red rings in the first three courses. The finale of each cup has everyone drive one lap of the previous three tracks in sequence, rewarding those who learn the shortcuts ahead of time.\n\nSonic Racing: Crossworlds also features vehicle customization and a huge roster of familiar characters, each with stats that change the kart’s handling, acceleration, and overall speed. What’s more, the list of drivers will expand thanks to a host of DLC characters from different universes coming out in the next year. Soon, it will be a bit like the Super Smash Bros of kart racers, but with free Sega-owned characters and paid-for crossover ones. These paid-for ones include Minecraft and SpongeBob SquarePants, which are already available, with the likes of Pac-Man, Mega Man, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Avatar: The Last Airbender already announced to be coming throughout 2026.",

Foreign individuals, organisations and entities will also come under its jurisdiction if their Antarctic expeditions are organised within or launched from Chinese territory.\n\nTo get permission for activities such as expeditions, tourism and shipping in Antarctica, applicants will have to submit detailed plans, environmental impact assessment documents, emergency response plans and proof of insurance or financial guarantees to cover potential liabilities, according to the report.\n\nAny unauthorised activities, violation of authorisation terms, or breaches of management regulations and environmental protection duties could result in penalties.\n\nThe draft law also encourages activities to be carried out \"in an environmentally friendly and low-carbon manner\".\n\nIt sets out specific requirements for the protection of Antarctic flora and fauna, waste management and disposal, prevention of marine pollution, as well as area protection and the preservation of historic sites and monuments.\n\nThe draft also includes provisions for responding to sudden environmental incidents, according to Xinhua.\n\nChina has established five scientific stations in Antarctica. Photo: Xinhua alt=China has established five scientific stations in Antarctica. Photo: Xinhua>\n\nChina acceded to the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 and its first scientific expedition to the continent was in 1984. Five Chinese scientific stations have been established in Antarctica so far. China also became a signatory to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty in 1991.\n\nThe government formally established an administrative permission system for Antarctic expeditions in 2004 and standardised the application and management process within the State Oceanic Administration in 2014.\n\nBut there has been a legal gap when it comes to regulating non-official activities in Antarctica such as private expeditions, commercial tourism, fishing and shipping.\n\nThe legislation also comes amid a surge in Chinese tourism to Antarctica. China has become the second-largest source of Antarctic tourists after the United States.\n\nThe number of Chinese visitors to the continent peaked in 2018 at 8,273, accounting for 16 per cent of the global total, according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which promotes responsible travel to the continent.\n\nThe State Oceanic Administration issued guidelines on Antarctic tourism in 2018, prohibiting acts that cause harm to the fragile polar ecology. Those who violate the guidelines will be blacklisted and restricted from entering Antarctica for one to three years.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record.

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department announced Tuesday it was barring five Europeans it accused of leading efforts to pressure U.S. tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio did not name those he said fell foul of a new visa policy announced in May to restrict the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for censorship of protected speech in the United States. He identified them only as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations.\n\n“For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose,” Rubio posted on X. “The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.”\n\nThe five Europeans were later identified by Sarah Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, in a series of posts on social media. They include a former European Union commissioner and the leaders of organizations that address digital hate.\n\nRubio's statement said they advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the U.S.\n\nThe action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions.\n\nThe five named by Rogers are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton, who was responsible for digital affairs; and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index.\n\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, those targeted will generally be barred from entering the United States, and some may face removal proceedings if already in the country. Officials said the administration could expand the list if similar foreign actions continue.\n\nMost Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don’t necessarily need visas to come into the country. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security, so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.\n\nOther visa restriction policies were announced this year, along with bans targeting foreign visitors from certain African and Middle Eastern countries and the Palestinian Authority. Visitors from some countries could be required to post a financial bond when applying for a visa.",

That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more.

The president’s current approval is only slightly above his all-time low of 34 percent, recorded in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is the only other political figure in the poll to break 40 percent, with an approval rating of 41 percent.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (28 percent) and Senate GOP Leader John Thune (34 percent) post the lowest ratings, with Vice President JD Vance (39 percent), Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (36 percent), House Speaker Mike Johnson (35 percent), and embattled Attorney General Pam Bondi (36 percent) also registering uninspiring numbers.\n\nTrump is likely to be particularly irritated by how Americans view Powell. The president has repeatedly called for Powell to resign—at times even suggesting he could fire him as chair of the U.S. central bank—while unleashing a steady stream of insults.\n\nTrump has spent months attacking Powell as “stupid,” a “dummy,” and a “knucklehead” for refusing to slash interest rates to offset the president’s economically damaging tariff policies. The president was so blinded by rage at Powell’s refusal to bow to his demands that he appeared to have forgotten that it was he who appointed him in the first place.\n\n“He’s a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in July, despite nominating Powell in 2017.\n\nThat same month, the pair’s fractured relationship had an excruciating moment when Powell corrected Trump to his face after the president falsely claimed that renovation costs at the Fed’s Washington, D.C., headquarters totaled $3.1 billion.\n\nTrump suggested the figure had “just come out” when Powell questioned its source. After reviewing a piece of paper Trump handed him, Powell pushed back and explained that Trump was “adding a third building” to the total that “was built five years ago.”\n\n“It’s part of the overall work,” Trump insisted, prompting Powell to reply again: “It’s not new.”\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, has since cut interest rates three times this year as the central bank attempts to kick-start a struggling economy during Trump’s second term.\n\nThe most recent cut of 0.25 percentage points occurred on Dec. 10, lowering the benchmark rate to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "A tribute to Nation family we lost this year—from Jules Feiffer to Joshua Clover, Elizabeth Pochoda, Bill Moyers, and Peter and Cora Weiss\n\nAs this dismal year draws to its dismal close, it’s somehow consoling to reflect on the lives we lost in 2025—beautiful writers, influential editors, and committed activists, cherished members of the extended Nation family—and to look back at the writings they contributed to the magazine. Their words offer a much-needed testimony to the long, turbulent struggle for decency, democracy, liberty, and equality in this country and around the world. Whatever violent delights 2026 has in store, the legacies of those who came before can and should serve as an inspiration and a guide.\n\nAmong the friends the magazine lost was the satirical artist and screenwriter Jules Feiffer, who died in January at the age of 95. “Feiffer was America’s premier satirical cartoonist,” Jeet Heer wrote in an obituary, “the artist who best captured the tone and timbre of American public rhetoric and private anxiety from the time of Dwight Eisenhower to Bill Clinton.”\n\nIn addition to his long-running weekly cartoon strip in the Village Voice, Feiffer wrote plays, movies, novels, memoirs. Heer noted that Feiffer’s best work came when he allowed his satire to be leavened with empathy for the subjects he skewered: “He often balanced political contempt with human sympathy.” He had mastered, partly through a lifelong engagement with theater and acting, “the ability to look at the world through the eyes of even the most unsympathetic soul.”\n\nA few months before Feiffer’s death, Peter Kuper interviewed the legendary artist for The Nation. Feiffer had lost none of his dyspeptic bite in describing his trajectory from growing up in the age of Joseph McCarthy to living out his final years in the age of Donald Trump:\n\n[S]haking the cage is what I found myself drifting into doing, and finding I had no choice but to do that because I was living in a country that scared the shit out of me in terms of the direction it was going. And if you ask me how I changed the country, well, today I find myself living in a country where I’m scared shitless because of the direction in which we’re going.\n\nThe Nation published a number of Feiffer’s articles, speeches, and cartoons over the years, including a prescient depiction in 1996 of the proto-Trump GOP presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan, who grins mischievously as hordes of followers shout in joyous unison from the apparent safety of his enormous paws, about to be crushed.\n\nIn 1981, The Nation printed a version of a commencement address that Feiffer had given at the Pratt Institute about the mythology of “Movie America” in the age of Ronald Reagan. Though we live under a president shaped less by the formal demands of cinema than the must-watch spectacle of reality TV, it stills speaks to our moment:\n\nWith a hard-line ideology now in power, the stage is set for a debate that will prove or disprove arguments that have been chewed over for generations. Out of this debate will emerge a new American character either more authoritarian and repressive or more democratic and egalitarian. More curious and therefore more willing to suffer the complications and uncertainties that go with change or more willfully ignorant and arming to the teeth against the threat.\n\nWe are now full-fledged combatants in a war movie. A battle for the soul of the good old F.S.A.—the Fragmented States of America. I hope you’re on my side.\n\nIn April, the poet and critic Joshua Clover passed away at the age of 62. A professor of literature at the University of California, Davis, Clover was the author of a wide range of books spanning subjects from pop music to the political theory of riots, as well as several widely acclaimed poetry collections. Clover was long a fixture of The Nation’s Books and the Arts section. His first Nation review, published in 2007, concerned the poetry of Rod Smith, while his last was a sharp analysis and appreciation of The Get Down, Baz Luhrmann’s 2016 Netflix series on the origins of hip-hop. In between were almost impossibly erudite essays on topics from Baudelaire to economics, and a monthly column, “Pop & Circumstance,” which offered Clover’s perspective on country music, Game of Thrones, and Chomsky v. Zizek.\n\nJuliana Spahr wrote in her Nation tribute to Clover that “there were so many Joshuas, often contradicting yet frequently overlapping.” There was “Joshua the Militant,” a committed activist to the end of his life, and there was “Joshua the Political Theorist,” “Joshua the Scholar,” “Joshua the Organizer of Summer Camps,” “Joshua the Conference Organizer,” “Joshua the Publisher of Commune Editions and Editor of Commune Magazine,” “Joshua the Tweeter, lover of barbs and jabs, the shit-talker, the contrarian,” “Joshua the Marxist,” “Joshua the Organizer of Long Bike Rides,” “Joshua the Academic,” “Joshua the Connoisseur of Gummy Candies.”\n\nAnd then there was Joshua the Poet. He knew how to turn a phrase, build optimism, and remind us to love each other not just within occupied buildings but also within the short, limited lines of verse…. [I]f his writing is any one single thing, it is an invitation to join him in refusing to die.\n\nElizabeth Pochoda, a beloved literary editor of the magazine during much of the mid-1970s and through the 1980s, and a contributor for many years beyond that, died in May at the age of 83. Gene Seymour wrote a moving tribute to her:\n\nShe was one of those illuminated beings whose eyes entered a room—or your senses—before the rest of her did. Those wide pale orbs announced a hot-wired intensity that was at a higher, deeper level than most people were accustomed to casually encounter. To varying degrees, it was unsettling at first when Betsy aimed this intensity on you. Until you found out (and it usually didn’t take very long) that her focus was a gift, an acknowledgment that she’d seen something in you that aligned with her own formidable intellect and comprehensive passions. Such a meeting of minds promised fruitful and gratifying outcomes, especially if you were a writer and were lucky enough to have her as your editor.\n\nLike Clover’s, Pochoda’s interests ranged widely, from her first pieces for the magazine, a two-parter on the latest Czech fiction, to her theater reviews of the 1990s and her brief column “Reading Around,” a kind of high-brow pre-Internet aggregator of all the important essays and reviews and literary gossip worth taking notice of that week.\n\nIn addition to her involvement with many other publications, including Grand Street, which she helped found, and The Magazine Antiques, Pochoda kept writing for The Nation until shortly before her death, including tributes to former Nation comrades, Arthur Danto and Victor Navasky, an obit for Philip Roth, and meditations on American art and history.\n\nIn 2015, Pochoda wrote an essay for The Nation’s 150th anniversary issue reflecting on her tenure as literary editor—the freedom she enjoyed from the rest of the magazine that extended to her writers; the occasional political tensions and disagreements that resulted between the Books section and the rest of the magazine; her favorite pieces to reread—among them, Barbara Grizzuti Harrison’s 1986 critique of Joan Didion: “an outraged and outrageous piece,” Pochoda wrote, “wonderfully wrong occasionally and much more wonderfully right.”\n\nSeymour wrote in his obituary, “Betsy’s range of interests and her unerring instinct for matching writers with subjects broadened her reputation as a versatile, incisive editor and solidified the devotion of writers who followed her wherever she went, benefiting from her solicitousness and enthusiasm toward their individual voices as well as her insights into how to amplify and enhance their work.”\n\nWhat more can an editor do or be?\n\nJune brought the passing of Bill Moyers, one of the most influential journalists of the past 50 years. After beginning his career as a young aide and speechwriter to Lyndon Johnson, then as White House press secretary, Moyers grew disillusioned by the politically corrosive and morally indefensible Vietnam War. Leaving Washington, Moyers reinvented himself as a newspaper editor (at Long Island’s Newsday), then as a broadcaster, eventually becoming the most prominent media figure associated with public television.\n\nOver more than four decades at PBS—which he had helped create, as John Nichols reminded us when Moyers died—he produced and hosted landmark series like Bill Moyers Journal and Frontline, as well as countless specials on topics such as money in politics, corporate power, racial justice, faith, environmental degradation, and the erosion of democratic norms. Even as commercial media aided and abetted the concentration of wealth and power at the top of society, Moyers insisted that journalism should be a form of public service rather than entertainment.\n\nMoyers’s essays in our pages over the years touched on the corrupting influence of money in politics and the debasement of journalism in the age of media consolidation. In 2012, Moyers and his frequent collaborator Bernard Weisberger guest-edited a special issue, “The 1 Percent Court.” In the wake of the Citizens United decision, the issue assessed just how hollow the justices’ commitment to democracy had become. In his introduction, Moyers explained what would be needed to fight back: “[T]he battle is on many fronts, and will be won not only by voters on election day but by citizens engaged at every level of democracy and in every peaceful form of protest. There can be only one response to this usurpation of democracy: defiance.”\n\nIn November and December, respectively, we lost Peter and Cora Weiss, indefatigable activists who had spent decades supporting human rights and civil liberties in the United States and around the world. “He never ceased to push for a more just system, a more equitable system,” Peter Kornbluh of the National Security Archive said of Peter, a path-breaking lawyer, on Democracy Now! “There’s not enough words to describe how important Peter was to the progressive movement, to human rights, over these last decades.”\n\nPeter Weiss first wrote for The Nation in 1953 as a young attorney working in the field of international economic development. Through a long and illustrious career spent fighting to end the Vietnam War and South African apartheid, suing Henry Kissinger, and seeking restitution for victims of the US-backed Nicaraguan contras, among other causes, Weiss periodically returned to the magazine with new ideas and analyses. In 1993, he and two co-authors published a call for “Global New Deal.” The authors proposed replacing corporate-friendly trade pacts like NAFTA with “a new set of continental rules and measures, including the protection of labor rights and workplace health and safety standards.” Instead of nations’ signing agreements to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor, he called for them to team together to protect the environment, raise incomes for wage-earners, and divert military spending to socially beneficial purposes.\n\nCora Weiss, Peter’s longtime partner in both life and activism, died a month after her husband. She had written obituaries for The Nation about the German Green Party founder Petra Kelly and her fellow peace activist Dagmar Wilson. In 2016, she wrote a letter to the editor taking issue with an article the magazine had published that she considered overly critical and dismissive of the United Nations, where she worked with the International Peace Bureau. “The UN is only as good as its 193 parts,” she wrote. “Our world would be immeasurably worse without it.”\n\nAs it will be without these cherished friends of humanity, the nation, and The Nation. Let us profit from their wisdom.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",

    "fullText": "The search for the two men who disappeared from a boat in the middle of the Gulf has now become a FBI missing persons investigation.\n\nAfter four days missing and three full days of searching, Randall Spivey, 57, and his nephew Brandon Billmaier, 33, were not found by the numerous volunteers who assisted the U.S. Coast Guard's search mission by both sea and air.\n\nThe search radius covered approximately 6,700 square miles, which is about the size of the state of Connecticut.\n\nVolunteers from all over the Southwest United States joined the search mission, starting on Saturday (Dec. 20) and continuing through Monday, Dec. 22.\n\nThe United Cajun Navy, a volunteer-led nonprofit that specializes in life-saving rescue operations, also deployed an aircraft 100 miles west of Naples on Monday around 11 a.m.\n\nThe Coast Guard ultimately decided to suspend its active search efforts after carefully considering all the factors making this case, said Capt. Corrie Sergent, commanding officer of Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg in a press release by the USCG.\n\n“There is no harder decision than suspending a search. I am incredibly grateful for the crews, partners, and volunteers across this community who executed this massive search with the utmost professionalism, persistence, and compassion. We offer our sincere condolences to the families and friends of Mr. Spivey and Mr. Billmaier during this extremely difficult time,” Sergent said.\n\nThe FBI has now taken the case, classified as a missing person case, according to the Lee County Sheriff's Office.\n\nSpivey and Billmaier embarked on a fishing trip early morning on Friday, Dec. 19. They were supposed to come back that same evening but by 7:30, neither of their wives had heard back from them.\n\nThis prompted a call to the Coast Guard, and at 11 p.m., a helicopter had been deployed in search of the men.\n\nJust over two hours later, the families were notified that Spivey and Billmaier's boat was found −a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull\" −about 70 miles off the coast of Naples. The engine was still running.\n\nHowever, the men were nowhere to be found.\n\nThere were two life jackets missing from the boat, which made family members think Spivey and Billmaier could be wearing them.\n\nThe search efforts continued into the weekend as volunteers across Florida and surrounding states provided support.\n\n\"While this is heartbreaking, Brandon and Randy would never want anyone else to put their life in danger, and we know they would want this decision to be respected,\" Deborah Billmaier, wife of Brandon Billmaier, wrote in a Facebook post on Monday night.\n\nSpivey was a prominent Fort Myers personal injury attorney. He is the founder of Spivey Law Firm, where his wife Tricia Spivey is also a personal injury lawyer.\n\n“He's an amazing, amazing man and he's dedicated his life to helping other people as an attorney and helping them in their time of need. And that's why it's so touching that many people are now stepping up to find him,” Tricia Spivey told The News-Press on Saturday, Dec. 20.\n\nShe said that Spivey and his nephew loved to fish, and her husband had been fishing for over 30 years.\n\nOne poster on Facebook, Andrew Abel, recalled Randy\" as a \"dear friend and mentor.\"\n\n\"I will truly never forget how he was there for me whenever I needed and without asking. Randy would drop everything he was doing to help. Always. Randy championed his family and friends and I'm forever grateful that he championed me and has allowed me to be a part of his family too,\" Abel wrote on Monday night.\n\nAnother poster, Cristina M. Puccio, wrote \"Randy has been a beacon of kindness and warmth in my life for many years, and I feel truly fortunate to have known him.\"\n\nLike his uncle, Billmaier was also a personal injury lawyer in Boca Raton with the Shiner Law Group.\n\nA statement by Shiner Law Group says: \"On behalf of everyone at Shiner Law Group, we are deeply saddened by the disappearance of Brandon and his uncle, Randy. Brandon is a valued member of our firm and someone we care about tremendously, both as a colleague and as our friend. Brandon is an exceptional person and a great lawyer, and we are heartbroken.\"\n\nBillmaier grew up in Michigan and is a graduate of the University of Toledo. Beyond fishing, he likes to play pickleball and travel.\n\nBillmaier also got married last year. Traveling is something that the couple did a lot of together. On social media, Deborah Billmaier shared that they've travelled to more than 30 countries.\n\n\"Brandon is my best friend, my husband and my greatest love. Every day he showed me what true, unconditional love looks like. We had so many dreams and plans, and I am forever grateful for the five most beautiful years we shared together,\" Deborah Billmaier wrote on her social media accounts.\n\nOne commenter, Megan Schlett, said: \"Brandon was supposed to be the Best Man in our wedding, and he will forever hold that title. There is no one more worthy of that for Sebastian. Brandon was a like a brother to Sebastian and we all love Brandon deeply.\"\n\nAnother commenter, Donna Antonelli, wrote: \"Brandon was humble, genuine, sweet, always had a positive attitude and would always help a fellow attorney. He was a true gentlemen which is so very rare these days. He will be missed by me tremendously.\"\n\nTayeba Hussein is a breaking news reporter for The News-Press & Naples Daily News.

Authorities found 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard’s body Dec. 6 in a rural area of Utah after a man and woman taking photos off of State Route 24 reported they had discovered remains.\n\nOfficers could not immediately identify her but concluded she died from gunshot wounds to the head, Brown said. The FBI's DNA analysis of the body found a familial DNA match to Buzzard.\n\nDetectives also found similar ammunition in a car Buzzard had rented, authorities said.\n\nBuzzard is being held without bail at the Northern Branch Jail in Santa Barbara, Brown said.\n\nOnline jail records did not list a court date or attorney who could speak on Buzzard’s behalf. The public defender’s office represented her in another case in November but did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA school administrator reported Melodee Buzzard's prolonged absence Oct. 14. Deputies went to the family's residence in Lompoc, but Buzzard would not say where her daughter was.\n\nBuzzard left California with her daughter on Oct. 7, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. They traveled as far as Nebraska with stops in Nevada, Arizona and Utah, and a return route included Kansas. Melodee Buzzard was last seen Oct. 9 on video surveillance near the Colorado-Utah line.\n\nDetectives learned the mother and daughter changed their appearance during travel. Video from the rental car office in Lompoc shows the child wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a wig that was darker and straighter than her natural hair, police said. The video shows her mother wearing a long, curly haired wig.\n\nBuzzard swapped wigs throughout the trip and changed the license plate of the rental car to avoid detection, police said. Buzzard returned home on Oct. 10 but her daughter was not with her, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nBrown said the crime was “calculated, cold-blooded” and premeditated, though a motive has not been determined.\n\n“Today, we stand together in grief, but also with resolve,” Brown said. “Melodee deserved a far better life than she had.”\n\nOfficials said the weapon has not been found, and the case remains under investigation.\n\nLilly Denes told the Los Angeles Times that her granddaughter was loveable, always smiling and well-behaved. Denes' son, the child's father, died when she was 6 months old. A detective told Denes on the phone Tuesday that authorities had “found the baby and the baby is with her dad,\" Denes said.\n\n“I knew he was telling me that the baby is dead,\" Denes said.",

    "description": "While Bill Gates has said the two-day workweek could come within the next decade, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says Gen Alpha college graduates will be too busy planet-hopping.",
    "fullText": "With Gen Z facing existential career crises, billionaire OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that in just 10 years, college grads will be exploring the solar system—jobs that will reel in sky-high salaries. The tech leader even says he’s envious of young people because our early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison.\n\nAs AI reshapes the workforce, many Gen Z college graduates are finding out the hard way that their degrees don’t guarantee a smooth career launch.\n\nNow, even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman—one of Silicon Valley’s biggest leaders driving the AI revolution—is admitting the elephant in the room is true: AI will wipe out some jobs entirely. However, the tech billionaire insists the coming decade could be the most exciting time in history to start a career, especially for anyone who’s ever dreamed of working in space.\n\nNot only will they be reeling in sky-high salaries, but Altman says they’ll also be “feeling so bad for you and I that we had to do this really boring, old work and everything is just better.”\n\n“In 2035, that graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some completely new, exciting, super well-paid, super interesting job,” Altman told video journalist Cleo Abram.\n\nThough it’s unclear how widespread space exploration will expand in the coming years—considering NASA’s broad goal of getting to Mars in the 2030s—aerospace engineers are growing faster than the national average of all jobs, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And they bring home an envy-inducing annual paycheck of over $130,000.\n\nOther tech pioneers have AI predictions that are more grounded on Earth—but still alluring to workers. For example, billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said that the technology might dramatically reduce the length of the workweek, thanks to humans no longer being needed “for most things.”\n\n“What will jobs be like? Should we just work like two or three days a week?” the tech billionaire told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed that AI has already given his workers “superhuman” skills—something that will only increase as the technology advances.\n\n“I’m surrounded by superhuman people and super intelligence, from my perspective, because they’re the best in the world at what they do. And they do what they do way better than I can do it. And I’m surrounded by thousands of them. Yet it never one day caused me to think, all of a sudden, I’m no longer necessary,” he separately told Cleo Abram on her Huge Conversations podcast series.\n\nWhile Altman admitted that his crystal ball remains foggy—and that the true direction of AI is unclear—he is actually envious of Gen Z professionals starting off their careers: “If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history,” he added to Abram.\n\nFortune reached out to OpenAI for comment.\n\nAfter the launch of OpenAI model, GPT-5, Altman declared the world has access to technology equivalent to a “team of PhD-level experts” right in their pocket. And as a result, the CEO said it will be easier than ever for one person to create a business that used to take “hundreds” of people—all it takes is coming up with a great idea and mastering AI tools.\n\n“It is probably possible now to start a company, that is a one-person company that will go on to be worth more than a billion dollars, and more importantly than that, deliver an amazing product and service to the world, and that is like a crazy thing,” he said.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban has gone even further with his prediction, saying that AI could give Elon Musk a run for his money as the world’s richest person.\n\n“We haven’t seen the best or the craziest of what [AI is] going to be able to do,” Cuban told the High Performance podcast. “And not only do I think it’ll create a trillionaire, but it could be just one dude in the basement. That’s how crazy it could be.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on August 11, 2025.\n\n‘Godmother of AI’ says degrees are less important in hiring than how quickly you can ‘superpower yourself’ with new tools\n\nForget the four-day workweek, Elon Musk predicts you won’t have to work at all in ‘less than 20 years’\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says ‘millions of people’ will be living in space by 2045—and robots will commute on our behalf to the moon\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "Zampella created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today, and his cinematic and epic military, sci-fi and Star Wars games thrilled and moved millions\n\nVince Zampella dies aged 55 – news\n\nOn Sunday, Vince Zampella, the co-creator of the Call of Duty video game series, died in a car crash in Los Angeles at the age of 55. Though best known for that series of blockbuster military shooters, Zampella touched a huge number of lives – not only the hundreds of people who worked at the game development studios he led under Activision and EA, but the millions of people who played the games that bore his imprint.\n\nA lifelong gamer, Zampella had a Pong console as a child, then an Atari 2600 and a Commodore 64. He told IGN in 2016 that his favourite game from childhood was Donkey Kong: “I would spend hours at the arcade playing it.” Zampella’s first job in the industry was at GameTek in Miami, which specialised in video-game versions of popular US quizshows. He described his role on the small team as: “producer slash customer services slash tester – whatever needed to be done.”\n\nIt was at a developer called 2015, Inc in Tulsa that Zampella had his first smash hit as lead designer. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was the third title in the acclaimed series of second world war shooters, which had been inspired by Saving Private Ryan and written in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. Zampella had envisioned a new type of shooter with an epic, cinematic sense of immersion. The game was a bestseller, acclaimed for its globetrotting narrative and taut, tense action – especially during its thrilling depiction of the Omaha beach landing.\n\nWhen publisher Electronic Arts made the decision to take the development of Medal of Honour in-house, Zampella and his colleague Jason West left, together with Grant Collier, and set up Infinity Ward in Los Angeles. There they created Call of Duty, a second world war shooter designed to exceed Medal of Honor’s sense of epic drama – indeed, its original development title had been Medal of Honor Killer. Critically, the game featured a range of lead characters including US, British and Russian fighters rather than giving players control of a single “super soldier”. “It’s meant to show you that no one side won the war – it was an allied effort,” Zampella said at the time.\n\nOnce again, the emphasis was on dramatic set-piece battles on a vast scale, with the player surrounded by computer-controlled allies giving the impression of being a small part of a wider campaign. “We’re all about authenticity and intensity,” Zampella said. “We’ve strived to put as many guys on screen as possible. It’s about your squad, not you as a lone gunman.”\n\nThis emphasis on teamwork and cinematic intensity would become emblematic of Call of Duty. While two sequels remained in the theatre of the second world war, for the fourth title, released in 2007, Zampella and West decided to move into the modern era. The result, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is one of the most important and influential first-person shooters ever made.\n\nIts campaign features a group of special forces operatives, including newcomer John “Soap” MacTavish and grizzled SAS captain John Price, taking on Russian ultra-nationalists and a Middle Eastern warlord. It had imaginative and exciting missions, including All Ghillied Up, a sniper mission in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster, and the eerie Death From Above, in which players control the various weapons of a C-130 aircraft, taking out enemies on the ground who appear merely as dots on an infrared screen. Meanwhile, the game’s online multiplayer mode brought new innovations including kill-streaks, which allowed players on a winning run to call in special attacks such as airstrikes. Infinity Ward created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today. Call of Duty’s DNA is present in every modern hit of the genre.\n\nIn 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Infinity Ward by publisher Activision, and went on to form Respawn Entertainment, taking more than 30 Call of Duty staff with them. Under new publisher Electronic Arts, the company released Titanfall in 2014, a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter intended to innovate within the genre. The game emphasised the player’s freedom of movement, allowing for smooth, parkour-style navigation of obstacles and structures. Players were also able to call in and pilot giant, heavily armed mechs. As Zampella explained at the time: “It’s taking the old paradigm of these shooter games being very grounded and two-dimensional and now adding this verticality to it and making it something that’s a new experience; something that people haven’t seen before.”\n\nAfter splitting with Activision, Zampella advised several other game creatives who found themselves at odds with their publishers and were considering striking out on their own. One of them was Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear Solid and, at his own studio Kojima Productions, the Death Stranding series. “When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways,” wrote a “heartbroken” Kojima on X after Zampella’s death. “He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures”\n\nTitanfall’s sequel added an extraordinary single-player story to the original’s fluid online play – it is still one of the best shooter campaigns around. That series’ emphasis on smooth, seamless movement would also characterise Respawn’s entry into the battle royale genre: Apex Legends. Released with almost no pre-publicity in 2019, it would attract 10m players in its opening 72 hours and still maintains a place in the pantheon alongside Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone.\n\nRespawn next made two excellent single-player Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Zampella’s peers have noted that working on the Star Wars franchise brought him and his colleagues at Respawn great joy.\n\nIn 2020, Electronic Arts put Zampella in charge of the Battlefield franchise, with a remit to recharge the series after the disappointing performance of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Released in October, Battlefield 6 was widely praised as a return to form, especially the online multiplayer modes. It sold 7m copies in three days, the best ever opening for the series.\n\nZampella will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his era and a ceaseless innovator in the first-person shooter genre – and with the Star Wars Jedi series, outside it. He was someone whom you always looked forward to encountering or interviewing at games industry events, an outspoken creative who cared deeply about video games and the player’s experience.\n\n“Vince was an extraordinary person – a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognise talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,” wrote Geoff Keighley on X, who runs the Game Awards and, as a former games journalist, worked on a documentary about Titanfall with Zampella. “Even when it was difficult or uncomfortable, Vince never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency. He believed that the truth mattered, and he was willing to share it with the world. Vince cared deeply about doing the right thing. And even while working inside large organisations, he consistently pushed to put players first – to prioritise the experience, the craft and the people who played the games. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work … I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it.”",

    "fullText": "Home Depot has always sort of done its own thing as a large retailer.\n\nWhereas other retailers may hire any old person to stock shelves or ring up purchases, Home Depot tends to hire knowledgeable sales associates who are trained in specific trades.\n\nIf you need help finding the right bedroom paint, for example, there's a person for that. If you're being brave and tackling a bathroom remodel on your own, there are store associates who can guide you toward the right materials.\n\nPlus, the very nature of Home Depot is that it's a store customers tend to need year-round. That's why Home Depot maintains long hours throughout the year, opening as early as 6 a.m. and closing as late as 10 p.m.\n\nIt's that very consistency that customers have come to rely on.\n\nMany retailers close their doors to shoppers multiple times during the year. It's pretty common, in fact, for stores to be closed on holidays that include Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day.\n\nHome Depot, though, stays open almost every day of the year. And part of the reason is that the company prides itself on being perpetually available to customers.\n\nStill, Home Depot does draw the line with two major holidays — Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.\n\nThose are the only two days during the entire calendar year that Home Depot won't welcome shoppers in.\n\nIt's the same store-closure schedule Walmart sticks to, and it's one that consumers may find frustrating, given that they're used to Home Depot being open all the time. But while some customers may not like it, there's a reason behind it.\n\nClosing twice a year makes sense for Home Depot for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, the company maintains huge stores, similar in size to the Costco warehouses many customers find impressive but overwhelming.\n\nIt costs money just to keep a store that large running for a day. And given that Thanksgiving and Christmas aren't really big home-improvement days, foot traffic is likely to be minimal at those times.\n\nIt's just not worth the cost of staying open for what could be only a handful of customers.\n\nBut Home Depot also needs to keep its sales associates happy. These aren't any old retail workers — they're people who know their way around home improvement and specific products.\n\nGiving workers time off for these major holidays is essential to retaining good employees.\n\nCostco CFO makes rare pricing promise\n\nHome Depot faces growing consumer boycott calls ahead of holidays\n\nTarget’s efforts to make amends with customers hit a snag\n\nAmazon lawsuit could be a warning to other employers",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for China's AI companies is also being stimulated by ​Beijing's push for tech independence. China has fast-tracked blockbuster listings of chipmakers, notably Moore Threads (688795.SS), dubbed \"China's Nvidia\", and MetaX (688802.SS), which both debuted this month.\n\nForeigners see China closing ‌the tech gap with the U.S. as Beijing steps up support for AI chipmakers, spurring bets on Chinese companies just as worries grow over lofty valuations on U.S.-listed AI stocks.\n\nU.K.-based asset manager Ruffer, for example, said it has \"deliberately limited ‌exposure\" to the Magnificent Seven - the U.S. tech giants - and is looking to add positions in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) for a bigger exposure to China's AI theme.\n\n\"While the U.S. remains the leader in frontier AI, China is rapidly narrowing the gap,\" said Gemma Cairns-Smith, Investment Specialist at Ruffer. \"The moat may not be as wide, or as deep, as many think ... The competitive landscape is shifting.\"\n\nRuffer is gaining exposure to the AI theme through Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, which operates an AI chip unit, owns large language model Qwen, and is ploughing money into cloud infrastructure.\n\nGlobal asset managers are increasingly eyeing Chinese AI firms ⁠as a wave of startups lists on the mainland and in ‌Hong Kong, seeking to tap into surging investor appetite following the meteoric rise of DeepSeek, China’s answer to ChatGPT.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management in a report this month rated China tech as \"most attractive\", citing investors' search for geographical diversification and China's \"strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid ‍AI monetization\".\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) currently trades at 31 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 24 for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech (HSTECH.HK), which enables AI bets via stocks including Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK), Baidu (BIDU, 9888.HK), Tencent (0700.HK, TCEHY) and chip foundry SMIC (0981.HK).\n\nRiding the momentum, U.S. investment adviser Rayliant helped launch a Nasdaq-listed fund in September that gives investors access to \"China's versions of stocks like Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, and OpenAI\".\n\nKraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern said the ​rapid ascent of Chinese AI chipmakers such as Cambricon speaks to the scale and speed of innovation across China's AI and semiconductor industries.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to reallocate federal Homeland Security funding away from states that refuse to cooperate with certain federal immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary McElroy's ruling on Monday solidified a win for the coalition of 12 attorneys general that sued the administration earlier this year after being alerted that their states would receive drastically reduced federal grants due to their “sanctuary” jurisdictions.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency reduced more than $233 million from Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The money is part of a $1 billion program where allocations are supposed to be based on assessed risks, with states then largely passing most of the money on to police and fire departments.\n\nThe cuts were unveiled shortly after a separate federal judge in a different legal challenge ruled it was unconstitutional for the federal government to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get FEMA disaster funding.\n\nIn her 48-page ruling, McElroy found that the federal government was weighing states' police on federal immigration enforcement on whether to reduce federal funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program and others.\n\n“What else could defendants’ decisions to cut funding to specific counterterrorism programming by conspicuous round numbered amounts — including by slashing off the millions-place digits of awarded sums — be if not arbitrary and capricious? Neither a law degree nor a degree in mathematics is required to deduce that no plausible, rational formula could produce this result,” McElroy wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed judge then ordered the Department of Homeland Security to restore the previously announced funding allocations to the plaintiff states.\n\n“Defendants’ wanton abuse of their role in federal grant administration is particularly troublesome given the fact that they have been entrusted with a most solemn duty: safeguarding our nation and its citizens,\" McElroy wrote. \"While the intricacies of administrative law and the terms and conditions on federal grants may seem abstract to some, the funding at issue here supports vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs.”\n\nMcElroy notably cited the recent Brown University attack, where a gunman killed two students and injured nine others, as an event where the $1 billion federal program would be vital in responding to such a tragedy.\n\n“To hold hostage funding for programs like these based solely on what appear to be defendants’ political whims is unconscionable and, at least here, unlawful,” the Rhode Island-based judge wrote in her ruling, issued little more than a week after the Brown shooting.\n\nDHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department plans on fighting the order.\n\n“This judicial sabotage threatens the safety of our states, counties, towns, and weakens the entire nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"We will fight to restore these critical reforms and protect American lives.”\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general who sued the administration applauded the order.\n\n“This victory ensures that the Trump Administration cannot punish states that refuse to help carry out its cruel immigration agenda, particularly by denying them lifesaving funding that helps prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement.",

Her 11-year-old daughter was injured but survived. The girl eventually told an investigator that her mother said God made her do it, according to court documents in the United Kingdom.\n\nSingler, who had superficial knife wounds, told police that a man who entered the apartment was responsible. She was initially considered a victim.\n\nThe surviving daughter backed up Singler’s claim at first, but police sought to arrest Singler on Dec. 26, 2023, after they said the girl changed her story. By then Singler was gone. She was found four days later in London’s upscale Chelsea neighborhood and arrested. It is not known why she ended up there.\n\n“Today really is a significant milestone in this criminal investigation,” Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez said at a news conference. “Singler is accused of committing an unthinkable act. ... I know these acts have deeply impacted this community, and our hearts remain with the victims.\"\n\nAllen said Singler will be held without bond at least until a preliminary hearing on whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed toward trial. That hearing typically is scheduled within 30 days of an initial court appearance, with some exceptions, he said.\n\nAllen and other officials declined to discuss details of the prosecution's case beyond procedural steps.\n\nThe FBI and Colorado Springs police traveled to London to take custody of Singler, who fought extradition and denied attacking her children.\n\nHer London defense attorney, Edward Fitzgerald, argued that she should not be extradited because if convicted of first-degree murder in Colorado, she would face a mandatory sentence of life without parole — a sentence that violates European human rights law.\n\nFitzgerald represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in his long fight against extradition to face espionage charges in the U.S.\n\nSingler did not yet have a U.S.-based attorney listed as representing her in court documents, according to the court clerk’s office.\n\nA judge rejected Singler's challenge in January 2025, and her bid for an appeal was denied in November.\n\nSingler also faces one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault.\n\nAccording to U.K. court documents, the children's bodies were found by police shortly after midnight on Dec. 19, 2023. Police said they found no footprints in the snow leading to a patio where Singler said an intruder entered through an unlocked door and attacked her, causing her to lose consciousness.\n\nShe told police that her ex-husband “had previously dreamt about killing his family, that the children’s father was always trying to ‘frame her’ and ‘get her arrested’ and to have the kids taken away from her,” Judge John Zani said in a January ruling against Singler in Westminster Magistrates' Court.\n\nPolice said GPS records showed that her ex-husband was driving a truck about 80 miles (130 kilometers) away at the time of the killings.\n\nThe family had been staying with Singler’s mother during the custody battle, but the mother was away at the time, according to court documents in the U.K.\n\nThe day before the bodies were found, a judge in Colorado ordered Singler to comply with a previous order to allow the father to take custody of them for the holidays, according to state court records. She was told to either give the children to her ex-husband on her own or bring them to a court hearing Dec. 20, 2023, to exchange custody there.\n\nOn the day of the hearing, Singler asked the judge to delay it, saying in a motion that she and her children had been attacked and two of them were murdered. She asked for time to grieve and “gain my bearings after this incident.”",

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance posted glossy photos of his personal training session with Navy SEALs—but the beachside stunt immediately drew mockery and accusations of political tone-deafness.\n\nThe 41-year-old former Marine, who served in Iraq before entering politics, had joined the Navy’s special-operations community for an early-morning workout at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California, a longtime hub for SEAL selection and training.\n\nFrom the official @VP account, Vance shared images on Monday of himself sprinting along the surf, hauling a log with helmeted operators whose faces were blurred, scrambling up a cargo net, and riding in a small boat punching through the waves.\n\n“Vice President Vance trains with @USNavy Seals at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado,” the caption read. On his personal account, Vance gushed that he had “just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes.”\n\nHe added, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!”\n\nCritics were unimpressed. “Nice cosplay as a Navy SEAL,” one user wrote, adding: “Leadership isn’t about photo ops, it’s about fixing the mess at home.”\n\nOther critics photoshopped the infamous meme of Vance with a cartoonishly puffy face onto the soldiers he was working out with, using “GI Jello” as a punchline.\n\nAnother commenter sneered that it was a “desperate photo op for a Vice President who cares more about his military ‘aesthetic’ than actually governing.”\n\nDigital strategist Mike Nellis jabbed: “Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks.”\n\nAnd Democratic strategist Christopher Hale wrote on X, “It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL.”\n\nVance’s made-for-camera workout follows a Trumpian trend of the president’s inner circle engaging in theatrics. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, 45, marked the D-Day anniversary and his birthday in June by leading a filmed PT session with troops on Omaha Beach before delivering a speech at the Normandy American Cemetery, a spectacle that also drew scrutiny as self-promotion.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly been mocked as “ICE Barbie” for using federal law enforcement as props in a string of stylized photo ops, from tactical-gear raids to glossy fitness clips.\n\nThis is also not the first time Vance has tried to curry favor with the military. Ahead of Thanksgiving, he delivered a comedy skit to troops at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the vice president’s office for comment.",
